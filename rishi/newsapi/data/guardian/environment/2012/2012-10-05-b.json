  "<h2><strong>The track I always play to rescue a dancefloor </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7r83-y3j2A\" title=\"\"><strong>Donna Summer: I Feel Love</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>There are times when I take people on long, deep, psychedelic journeys with my music, and having a track like this at your disposal is great for rewiring the crowd back to some kind of normality.</p> <h2><strong>The track that currently gets the most rewinds </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDcOnaeVmUM\" title=\"\"><strong>Andre Kraml: Safari</strong></a></h2> <p>A Crosstown Rebels classic. When you hear the opening bars, there's nothing you can do but be excited about what follows.</p> <h2><strong>The track I wish I'd signed to my label</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UFhdYhE9ko\" title=\"\"><strong>Chic: I Want Your Love</strong></a></h2> <p>One of my favourite records of all time. I play this one out as the last tune at parties where I feel like I've really connected with the crowd.</p> <h2><strong>The track I'd play at my auntie's wedding</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dx42GrDCus\" title=\"\"><strong>Exile: Kiss You All Over (Brennan Green Edit)</strong></a></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Not because I'd like to kiss my auntie all over, but I think she would appreciate this genuine lovers' anthem.</p> <h2><strong>The track that got me out of bed this morning</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HnvNtgZmLc\" title=\"\"><strong>Prince: Purple Rain</strong></a></h2> <p>This is my most played 12\" at home in LA.

  "<p><strong>As a long-term HSBC customer I decided to use its travel money online service to convert some sterling into euros for my holiday this summer.</strong></p> <p><strong>It promises a better exchange rate than both ordering over the phone, or just walking into an HSBC branch. It also makes it easy to transfer the funds to pay for the currency. </strong></p> <p><strong>I completed the online form but the transaction was declined. I called HSBC's customer services. </strong></p> <p><strong>We went through the process again and it failed again. The woman informed me she could not tell me why it had been declined and I needed to speak to someone from the Travelex helpdesk. They could not help, and I had to talk to HSBC.</strong></p> <p><strong>It eventually transpired that the online ordering system could not recognise apostrophes \u2013 my surname is O'Hara. </strong></p> <p><strong>I was told there was nothing I could do as the system is not set up to cope with people with apostrophes in their name. </strong></p> <p><strong>I find it totally unbelievable that a multinational global financial institution has an online service that can't be used by someone with an apostrophe in their name. </strong></p> <p><strong>I have spent around two hours and spoken to six different people in order to complete a transaction that should take a couple of minutes. </strong><em>J O'H, Leeds </em></p> <p>What a palaver \u2013 but one that, fortunately, has now been fixed. HSBC said the majority of customers with apostrophes in their names were able to use the service; however, it admits that where apostrophes didn't match the records the transaction may have failed. A spokesman for the bank says: \"We have implemented a fix which means these names won't fall foul of this now.

  "<p>The gates outside <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/charlotte-church\" title=\"\">Charlotte Church</a>'s house are huge, heavy and automated. I press the intercom, but there is no answer. So I stare through the slats up the long, winding drive and acres of garden. There is no sign of the house. This is about as private as private residences get.</p> <p>Once you know about Church's history, it begins to make sense. It's not that the former child singer announced she wanted to be alone and retreated from the world. Far from it: she loved her friends, her family, and was wedded to her community in Cardiff. No, Church was hounded into privacy. This is the girl for whom a clock was devised, counting down to her 16th birthday, when she would be \"legal\"; who was labelled promiscuous despite the fact that, at 26, she says she still has only ever had four boyfriends. This is the girl portrayed as a&#xa0;chav, a binge drinker, a fallen angel, a symbol of everything wrong with modern Britain. For others in her family, it was even worse. In February this year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/feb/23/charlotte-church-phone-hacking-case\" title=\"\">Church and her parents accepted \u00a3600,000 in damages and costs after Rupert Murdoch's News International admitted that Church's voicemail messages were targeted repeatedly over a number of years</a>, and that it had unlawfully obtained and published private medical information about her and her mother.</p> <p>Given all that, perhaps the only surprise is that the gates aren't topped with barbed wire. Eventually, they open slowly, and ominously. I&#xa0;walk up the drive, half expecting to&#xa0;be frisked by heavies, but there's just a gardener mowing the lawn. So&#xa0;I walk some more, past kids' toys and footballs and a wendy house. \"Hi-yyyaa,\" Church shouts. She's in tracky bottoms, scruffy T-shirt, no makeup, chipped nails, and looks perfectly lovely.</p> <p>At an age when many young people are still living with their parents or dusting away their student days, Church has lived a dauntingly full life. It's not just the 10m records she had sold by 2007, nor the \u00a325m she was said to be worth in 2003 (now down to an estimated \u00a310m), nor her stint as <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-charlotte-church-show\" title=\"\">a very funny chatshow host</a> when she had just turned 20; it's also the relationship with rugby player <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/gavin-henson\" title=\"\">Gavin Henson</a>, their two children, the separation, the way she combines motherhood with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/25/charlotte-church-review\" title=\"\">a new music career as an indie rocker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/nov/28/leveson-inquiry-witnesses-smears-lies\" title=\"\">her impressive appearance in front of the Leveson inquiry</a> into hacking and, as a result, now her role as a patron of the pressure group <a href=\"http://hackinginquiry.org/\" title=\"\">Hacked Off</a>.</p> <p>A week earlier, we had met at a Rough Trade shop in east London, where she was showcasing her new EP. The audience was 30-strong, and seemed to consist mainly of people who worked in the shop and Church's friends \u2013 it couldn't have been further removed from the height of her teen fame, when she performed for the Pope or in front of 20,000 at the Hollywood Bowl. She sang half a dozen songs barefoot on a tiny stage, accompanied by a band (including her boyfriend on guitar), screaming, screeching, whispering and harmonising \u2013 part Bj\u00f6rk, part Radiohead \u2013 and having the time of her life. A pattern soon emerged. \"This is one I wrote after reading a piece in the Daily Mail,\" she said. \"Needless to say, I was pissed off.\" Then she introduced us to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGLIk4BPPWc\" title=\"\">Beautiful Wreck</a>, a song about exploitation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595246\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276069068/Charlotte-Church-1999-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church, 1999\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church in Voice Of An Angel in 1999. Photograph: George Bodnar </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Church's story was always going to be tabloid gold \u2013 the working-class Welsh girl who sang like an angel and would be our own <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Callas\" title=\"\">Maria Callas</a>. Even better, it was a story peopled with irresistible characters \u2013 the pushy mum, the father who wasn't the biological father, the grandad who played guitar and had met the Beatles, the aunt who fancied her chances at stardom, the tough manager, the liability boyfriends, and on it went.</p> <p>I once read an interview with Church when she was 14 in which the writer described her as \"the most fearsomely balanced, joined-up teenager you could meet\". I ask her if that rings true. She nods. \"Yeah, yeah. Fearsomely balanced \u2013 because you've got to work to maintain any sort of balance.\" Even when she was at her most exposed, she says, she never considered herself unbalanced. \"I've never been off the rails in my entire life.\"</p> <p>Right from the off, she was misrepresented, she says. We were led to believe she was fantastically ambitious, and her mother even more so. Rubbish, Church says. The only reason she got noticed in the first place was because she turned up with her aunt, who was taking part in a talent contest. When she did become successful, the story is that it ruined her. Again, she says, that's rubbish. She had a wonderful time \u2013 travelling the world, always with her mother, Maria, in Washington one day, at&#xa0;the Vatican the next. She even sat one of her GCSEs in the White House, where she had been performing for <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1125614.stm\" title=\"\">George Bush's inauguration</a> and wondered why there were so many protestors. Looking back now, she says, it's not her proudest moment politically, but it was still thrilling.</p> <p>And when she wasn't gigging, she was back at school leading a normal life. Did the other kids bully her about her fame? You've got to be joking, she says. They couldn't care less, and they were her mates, anyway. \"You can't forget how self-involved teenagers are. I was 14 and doing massive concerts and selling shit-tonnes of albums, and I'd get back and they'd be like, 'Whatever\u2026 So-and-so snogged so-and-so the other week,' who was going out with so-and-so. They'd fill me in on everything that was going on. That was the most important thing.\" Things couldn't have been better, she says.</p> <p>So what did go wrong? In 2000, her mother sacked her manager <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/jul/10/jonathan-shalit-mediaguardian-100-2009\" title=\"\">Jonathan Shalit</a>; he eventually received an estimated \u00a32m in an out-of-court settlement. The press monstered Maria. \"That was when it turned, and I thought, this is really ugly.\"</p> <p>Church insists her mother was simply looking after her \u2013 she claims Shalit exploited her financially (he received 40% of her royalties from record sales) and says she did not enjoyed dealing with him. \"He was just\u2026 odd. I said to my mother, 'If I&#xa0;have to work with that man another day, I'm not singing another note,' and she said, 'OK.' The press turned it into this stereotypical situation where she was the pushy mother.\"</p> <p>But Maria wasn't portrayed simply as pushy, but as greedy and mad, too, wasn't she? \"Yes. But what she essentially was is strong as hell, because she wasn't going to let anyone overwork me or not let me have a normal childhood. They called her the Welsh dragon, and she was a dragon in a certain sense, but it was only to protect her young.\"</p> <p>By this time, Church had already found herself in a compromising clinch with the tabloid press. At 13, she was asked to sing at Rupert Murdoch's wedding in New York. Her management was told she could either be paid \u00a3100,000 or she \"would be looked upon favourably by Mr Murdoch's papers\". It sounds like an episode of the Sopranos, I say.</p> <p>She smiles. \"It is very mob, isn't it? I didn't have a clue who he was. I was told he's a really important man, he'll be able to help your career, and that didn't even matter to me. I wasn't ambitious. I've never been ambitious.\"</p> <p>She was flown from LA to New York on Murdoch's private jet. \"It was unbelievable. The taps were gold.\" What was the wedding like? \"I thought everybody looked ridiculous because they had all this finery on, but no shoes, because it was antique wood on the boat. There was this young bride, Wendi Deng, and I remember thinking, she's really beautiful and he's really old. That is what my 13-year-old brain said to me.\"</p> <p>Murdoch asked her to sing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn4sXY2u9xg\" title=\"\">Pie&#xa0;Jesu</a>, which she did reluctantly after telling his people it was inappropriate. \"I said, 'Well, it's a requiem \u2013 was he sure?' Apparently he was insistent. I&#xa0;remember there were these huge, chocolate-covered strawberries, and he dropped the ring and all his aides came to help him find it \u2013 all these people in their finery with no shoes on searching for a ring!\"</p> <p>When did she find out why she'd performed for him? \"After the event, because I remember this \u00a3100,000 or favours being floated about, and me and my mother were like, 'No way, that's a&#xa0;phenomenal amount of money. No way are we turning that money down. Who is he? Who cares?' I'd much rather have just taken his money and invested it wisely, to be honest.\" She told Lord Leveson that her management persuaded her to accept the promise of favours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595247\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276939913/Charlotte-Church-and-Gavi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church and Gavin Henson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Church with ex-boyfriend Gavin Henson in 2006. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it happened, News International didn't keep its side of the bargain. So many stories appeared about Church's private life, from the insignificant to the major, that she began to doubt her friends. \"We knew we were watched, there were always journalists outside, whether it was my nan's house, my parents' house, my house. They'd follow me everywhere. We'd say, 'I swear they've got a bug in the house.' But you think that's so far-fetched. It makes you a bit paranoid. You look at people around you, and question everybody.\" She had a&#xa0;close-knit group of friends who had never given her reason to distrust them, but she started to anyway. \"I did cull certain people. I just cut them from my life.\" She says she has recently been back in touch with some of them and apologised.</p> <p>Awful though it was, Church always felt strong enough to look after herself. Yes, she was aware of the countdown clock to her 16th birthday (she says it was in the Sun and on two websites, while the Sun disputes that, saying it merely reported on its existence on a website), but tried to ignore it. \"They were digging on the whole virginity issue\u2026 and the whole of my developing body was just beneath the surface.\" Not that much beneath, I&#xa0;say. \"No, not really,\" she says quietly. \"I read bits and bobs, and it was like, yeuchh.\"</p> <p>How did it make her feel? \"I'm the kind of person who laughs off everything publicly, because I've always been in public and you can't go around wailing. Probably behind closed doors it made me&#xa0;weird out a bit \u2013 to be talked about as a&#xa0;commodity, like you're some kind of geisha.\"</p> <p>It was during this period that she read an interview she had given to the Times in which it was suggested that she had expected red carpet treatment when she visited Ground Zero after 9/11. She was devastated to be portrayed as a callous prima donna, and it didn't do much for her career in America. But she was advised to say nothing, and was determined it would not break her.</p> <p>At 18, she was old enough to drink in a pub, so the press turned her into an alcoholic. Was she drinking? \"Yes!\" She sounds shocked at the idea that she might not have been. \"I was 18, 19. I went to Ibiza on my first holiday with the girls. We were totally reasonable, we had a little villa, we went out, we had a great time. We didn't hurt anyone's feelings, we didn't get into trouble.\" Again, the fallen angel was too good a story to spurn, even if it wasn't true. \"This whole thing was going on at the time \u2013 look at our youth, binge drinking, wasting their lives. It was just a great way to point a finger and make me one of the figureheads.\"</p> <p>Did she ever puke publicly? \"No&#xa0;puking. I fell over on my 18th birthday because there were about 50 photographers in front of me flashing; they'd try to trip you up to&#xa0;get the under-skirt shot, and shout abuse at you to get a reaction.\"</p> <p>A couple of years later, when she was in her first trimester and had not yet told her parents, she read about her pregnancy in the Sun under the headline Church Sober Shock. Again, she found it traumatic, but knew she'd have to make the best of it.</p> <p>It was when newspapers began to pry into the life of her vulnerable mother that she knew things were out of control. In December 2005, the News of the World reported that Maria had attempted suicide. The deliberately misleading front-page splash was \"Church's 3-In-A-Bed Cocaine Shock\", accompanied by a photograph of the singer, while the first sentence read, \"Superstar Charlotte Church's mum tried to kill herself because her husband is a love rat hooked on cocaine and three-in-a-bed orgies.\"</p> <p>In her statement to Leveson, Church said what the paper failed to tell its readers was that the suicide attempt was \"at the very least in part due\u2026 to the fact that she was aware this story was coming out\". Maria went on to further self-harm after the story broke because of the impact it had on her. \"Her main concern was her parents, my grandparents, and the shame of it all \u2013 you know, we come from a Catholic family.\"</p> <p>And the information had been obtained through hacking? \"Yes, that was entirely through hacking. Even our priest was hacked, Father Richard, who was helping both of my parents deal with this at the time.\" Her parents came through it, she says, despite the newspapers.</p> <p>Church is convinced we've not heard the end of hacking \u2013 that there's more to come out. She says so many newspapers wrote stories about her based on private information, and has started digging around herself for clues to their origin.</p> <p>It's almost lunchtime, and Church is driving to the school and nursery where her kids have just started. Does she ever ask herself whether success was worth all this? \"All the time. How do you get out of it? You can't. I didn't really think about not being famous, because I'd hardly known a time I&#xa0;wasn't. I was 12 when it started, so it just felt like, 'This is life, this is what it is.' It wasn't like, 'I can opt out.' I didn't think like that. Now I&#xa0;do. Now I&#xa0;think this is an option; I can disappear.\"</p> <p>Did she consider living in another country? \"This is the thing. The record company wanted me to go to America and my family wanted to go&#xa0;to America, but I didn't. I wanted to stay in Wales where all my family and friends were. I love this country, and I just thought, fuck you, I'm not getting chased out. This is my home.\"</p> <p>She spots one of her friends pushing two babies down the street, beeps at her and opens the window. \"'Kaiiiiiiia! It's me! You OK? Ta-ra.' She's one of my best friends. I went round to hers yesterday. We had a little party with the kids.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397595248\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276611808/Charlotte-Church-performs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Church performs with her band in 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Church plays with her band at an ice-cream parlour in 2012. Photograph: Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some ways Church is still so girly that it's hard to believe 15 years have passed since her TV debut. At the same time, she seems older than her 26 years. She says she's changed recently. \"You know what? Leveson had a big impact. I&#xa0;became a lot more socially aware, and I'm just much more empowered. Also, putting an end to such a long chapter of my life, it made me a little freer, able to focus and re-evaluate. I've turned into a massive feminist, as well.\"</p> <p>Has motherhood changed her? \"Yeah. I've always been mature, but I think it's made me more emotional and responsible. And more caring. You want to be as safe as you can possibly be, so that when you go this world is OK, bearable, for your children to grow up in.\"</p> <p>Does she share the parenting with Henson? \"We've got a good relationship. We're both going tonight to an introductory parents' evening for the school\u2026 Oh, <em>shiiiiiit!</em> I'm in the wrong lane.\" She apologises to the driver she's heading straight towards. \"Sorrrrrrrry\u2026 Gavin has two overnights a week. It works pretty well when you've got two people who want the best for their children and can leave other baggage behind.\"</p> <p>It's funny, she says, she's so often been headline news, but she actually hates causing a stink. She does have the knack, though, I say. She grins. There's the time, for example, she called the Pope a Nazi, and just recently she referred to the Queen as an \"old woman\" who \"had no idea what's going on\", for which she apologised. \"I really don't like confrontation, believe it or not. I've just got strong opinions\u2026 They're easy to come by.\" Ask her what she thinks and she'll tell you. And sometimes she'll tell you even when&#xa0;you don't.</p> <p>We collect the kids, who have spent the morning making bread and bring their little rolls home. The two are jabbering away in the back of the car. \"Dexter, stop messing with that, please,\" Church says as her three-year-old son contemplates escaping his seat belt. \"Dexter Lloyd!\" Her voice is rising, half cajoling, half threatening.</p> <p>\"You went through a red light,\" five-year-old Ruby says.</p> <p>\"I didn't, darling. It was green, honest.\"</p> <p>We get home and the huge gates slowly open. \"Nilsson!\" she shouts in delight as a labradoodle bounds up to her. \"Niiiiilsson! He's named after the singer Harry Nilsson.\"</p> <p>Church's boyfriend, Jonny Powell, emerges in his pyjamas. He is an old family friend who used to work in her mother's pub. \"Sorry, I'd forgotten you were coming. I would have dressed a little bit more appropriately,\" he says as he shows me round the garage studio.</p> <p>\"He's a scholar, that boy,\" Church says proudly when he disappears. \"He's a smart, smart boy \u2013 he got a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He's a solo artist, released two albums, brilliant musician, and great with the kids.\" She says she plans to have a couple more children with Powell.</p> <p>In the kitchen, the band are eating sandwiches and discussing everything from American indie band Fatty Acids to string theory and the suicide of novelist David Foster Wallace. We could be in the world's smartest student house. Church always planned to go to university \u2013 when she was young, she wanted to be a vet or a lawyer \u2013 but it never quite worked out. Most of the band have been, and tell her it's not all it's cracked up to be.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, we meet in a small room above a pub where she is playing that night. The band are chatting away and eating fruit, just as they were round her kitchen table. Church looks happy. She says it's taken a&#xa0;while,&#xa0;but she finally feels she has found herself musically. When I&#xa0;say the music reminds me of&#xa0;a demented Radiohead, she lights up. \"I love that! Thank you! I love Radiohead. Yeah, it's been a long journey, but often I think it takes until you're in your 20s to&#xa0;find your thing.\"</p> <p>Would she enjoy the level of success now that she experienced as a teenager? \"No. You&#xa0;get stalkers and that kind of stuff. I'd love to have a steady, reasonably sized fan base so it's profitable and I can always make music in a&#xa0;way I want to.\" She has an idyllic image of herself making music in the garage while the kids are at school, then touring with the family in school holidays.</p> <p>She's also becoming more active as a patron of&#xa0;Hacked Off, and will be talking at the Conservative party conference this week. It's&#xa0;all&#xa0;very well having an inquiry into press hacking, but it will be of value, she says, only if&#xa0;it leads to&#xa0;change. She insists she would hate to see legislation that muzzled the press, but she&#xa0;does&#xa0;hope that Leveson's report, due later this year, leads to greater accountability. \"What I&#xa0;don't really understand is people saying this will compromise the freedom of the press. Was the press really free before, with such a small amount of people running it? I didn't think I had any freedom of speech. Lots of people didn't.\"</p> <p>Ultimately, she says, she's one of the lucky ones \u2013 she and her family were savaged but have come through it. Plenty don't. \"It's not about Murdoch. It's about the whole industry. I don't want to have to live that way ever again. And I don't think anybody else should have to live like that.\" \u2022</p> <p><strong>Charlotte Church's EP, One, is released by Alligator Wine Records on 15 October.</strong><br>\u2022 This article was edited on 11 October 2012.

  "<p>These are some of the things we know about the&#xa0;rising star of the Tory party. David Cameron's glittering understudy outshone the future PM at Oxford, where he was elected president of the union. During a distinguished career as a political journalist, he became the unlikely star of a satirical TV show, and continued to write a newspaper column after becoming an MP. Affectionately indulged across the Westminster spectrum, on account of his charm, his personal appeal transcends party loyalty. Contrary to popular opinion, however, his name is not Boris Johnson.</p> <p>\"People keep talking about Boris becoming prime minster,\" reflects an Oxford contemporary. \"But I think it's going to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>.\"</p> <p>If you have never met the secretary of state for&#xa0;education, and do not vote Tory, you may well be of the view that Gove is a nasty little rightwinger with a reactionary vision to return Britain to the 1950s. If so, the description I hear from practically everyone who has ever crossed his path will sound unrecognisable.</p> <p>\"I have only nice things to say about him,\" is&#xa0;the preface I hear time and again. Gove is, Chris&#xa0;Huhne says, \"The politest man in the House of Commons. Incredibly well-mannered. Much more so than people who come from grander backgrounds.\" A senior Labour figure tells me, \"The truth is, he doesn't act like a Tory. He is far&#xa0;too decent. He's in politics for all the right reasons.\" The political columnist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/matthew-dancona\" title=\"\">Matthew d'Ancona</a> agrees: \"He is just an incredibly nice guy. A lot of people are very nice&#xa0;guys, 'but' \u2013 and with politicians that can have&#xa0;a very big capital B. But he is an absolutely nice guy. He's not a fair-weather friend at all, he's&#xa0;fundamentally loyal, he is a very empathetic character and very solicitous of people's feelings. I'm yet to come away from a&#xa0;gathering where he&#xa0;hasn't charmed everybody in the room. Michael&#xa0;is&#xa0;a very ironic and incredibly good at taking the piss out of himself; he's one of&#xa0;those people you hope will be at dinner.\"</p> <p>From those who knew Gove as a young child, right through to colleagues today, the unanimity of opinion is almost freakish. George Allan was Gove's headmaster throughout secondary school,&#xa0;\"And when I see Michael on the television now, I&#xa0;can still see the 11-year-old boy. He didn't change&#xa0;his persona throughout his school career. Consistency \u2013 that's the word, consistency. We couldn't claim to be the authors of his remarkable civility. He created his own image.\"</p> <p>If Cameron fails to deliver a second term \u2013 and&#xa0;a&#xa0;clear Tory majority in 2015 is looking like a&#xa0;tall order \u2013 there will almost certainly be a new party leader. With the question of succession becoming a very real issue, the education secretary is a very real contender.</p> <p>In August 1967, a baby called Graham was born in Edinburgh to a young unmarried mother, and became Michael Gove four months later, the adopted son of a couple in&#xa0;Aberdeen. A younger sister was adopted five years later, and the Labour-voting family lived in&#xa0;a small ground-floor flat in a tidy if austere grey&#xa0;terrace, until his father's fish-processing business became successful enough for them to&#xa0;move into a three-bedroom semi.</p> <p>Gove attended his local state primary until the age of 11, when he passed the entrance exam to Aberdeen's most prestigious private school for boys. <a href=\"http://www.rgc.aberdeen.sch.uk/\" title=\"\">Robert Gordon's College</a> dominates the city&#xa0;centre, a relatively short distance from Gove's&#xa0;childhood home but a significant cultural leap. Every day the teenage Gove would set off&#xa0;from his little semi with its neat vertical white&#xa0;blinds and symmetrical hanging baskets, to&#xa0;an imposing&#xa0;granite colossus resembling a Soviet-style Eton. But he made the journey with&#xa0;remarkable ease. He rode an ancient bicycle,&#xa0;carried an umbrella, was fond of wearing&#xa0;suits, and quickly established himself as&#xa0;one of the school's most precocious characters.</p> <p>Mike Duncan taught Gove English and debating, and remembers a star debater and \"endlessly enquiring\" boy who enjoyed testing his teacher by reciting the opening line of a novel&#xa0;and challenging Duncan to name the book. Well&#xa0;read and self-consciously clever, Gove and his friends were big fans of sci-fi role-play games such as Wargame, and another called Nuclear War, which involved building up stocks of weapons and occasionally firing them off. A&#xa0;poem&#xa0;penned in his final year, An Essay On Teaching (With Apologies To Alexander Pope), may or may not make teachers smile today, and satirical entries about the senior boys in 1985 suggest he and his friends were already enthusiastic subscribers to Private Eye.</p> <p>\"Michael Gove: His eventual entrance to Oxfam University has finally confirmed his place among mere immortals. He now earns his money tutoring Mr Duncan in English. Naked without his tweeds, it is Colonel Fogey's ambition to be a&#xa0;listed building when he grows up.\" When Gove&#xa0;was invited back a few years later to take part in a debate, posters depicting a&#xa0;caricature of&#xa0;the Ghostbusters' ghost went up all over the school with the strap line: \"Take Govey down at&#xa0;the debate!\"</p> <p>\"Michael was very much a wit,\" one former classmate remembers, \"and a joy to have around. We were never intimates, but he was friendly, intelligent, a nice bloke. He wasn't cool or fashionable, but he was very popular because he would always have a funny rejoinder, and could outwit the teachers. My childhood memories are peppered with laughter because of Michael. One of the things I valued him for was that he prevented me from being bullied. I had glasses and red hair, and I&#xa0;vividly remember being bullied in the changing room, and Michael tried to stop it.\"</p> <p>Gove arrived at Lady Margaret Hall to study English in 1985. The novelist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/30/philip-hensher-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Philip Hensher</a> can still recall watching the freshers arrive, and noticing one dressed in a three-piece green tweed&#xa0;suit. \"It was really a young fogey thing. He&#xa0;seemed a little bit older than he was, but not in a ridiculous way. If&#xa0;there was an element of absurdity to him, he always seemed to be in on it,&#xa0;which is a very attractive characteristic.\"</p> <p>Anthony Goodman was president of the&#xa0;Oxford union when Gove arrived. \"He was one of the most gifted speakers I saw in the union. But he didn't generate any antagonism; he was confident, but not in a pushy, aggressive way. He just seemed like an old head on young shoulders.\" Goodman doesn't think Gove was contriving a performance to get in with the elite social set. \"That's pretty much why&#xa0;I did debating,\" he jokes, \"but not Gove. He&#xa0;came across as classless.\"</p> <p>The broadcaster and journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/samira-ahmed\" title=\"\">Samira Ahmed</a> edited the union magazine under Gove's presidency, and sums up the consensus: \"I&#xa0;just&#xa0;didn't see why anyone could loathe him,&#xa0;personally. He was a 40-year-old trapped in&#xa0;a&#xa0;20-year-old's body \u2013 but it was totally sincere. There's nothing fake about him at all. He&#xa0;exuded intelligence, and was very grown up for his age. And thinking big political thoughts, on a scale very few of us at that age were thinking. His vision was fully formed at 20.\" Another contemporary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/toby-young\" title=\"\">Toby Young</a>, agrees. \"He wasn't a&#xa0;work in progress like the rest of us. He seemed to arrive fully formed.\"</p> <p>Gove encountered his first ever setback after graduation, when a job application to the Conservative Research Department was rejected on the grounds that he was \"insufficiently Conservative\". So he returned to Aberdeen and joined the <a href=\"http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Press And Journal</a> as a trainee reporter. Within months, the paper went on strike.</p> <p>The father of chapel, Iain Campbell, recalls the staff's initial unease about Gove. \"We knew he was a Tory, and our concern was&#xa0;to have a united front. So we spoke to Michael, and he was happy to come on board. He&#xa0;wasn't a typical striker by any means, but he&#xa0;was very articulate, so we asked Michael to come&#xa0;to the European parliament in Strasbourg to lobby MEPs. He was a very good colleague. Being on strike can be very mentally straining, so we used to have parties to keep morale up, and he was someone who would always be there, and always very popular.\"</p> <p>Gove has subsequently said he thought the strike achieved little, and for how long he would have stuck it out we'll never know, for within three months he was offered a job in television, and soon moved south to work for the political programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/otr/\" title=\"\">On The Record</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">Today programme</a>. In 1992 he was hired by Channel 4 to&#xa0;present a late-night political comedy show, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103555/\" title=\"\">A&#xa0;Stab In The Dark</a>, somewhat to the surprise of&#xa0;his co-presenter, <a href=\"http://www.baddiel.com/\" title=\"\">David Baddiel</a>.</p> <p>\"I thought, I've never seen anyone on late-night alternative TV like this. He&#xa0;was rightwing and looked 53. I think he was wearing a three-piece suit. He wasn't cut from the&#xa0;obvious Tory cloth; he is&#xa0;a&#xa0;very bright bloke and a thinking rightwing person, and I'm always&#xa0;interested in intelligent people who think differently from me. I've had many rows with people I've worked with, but not&#xa0;Michael Gove. He was quite humble. He was&#xa0;always very unaggressive. Not trying all the&#xa0;time to intellectually defeat you in that way&#xa0;that politicians can.\"</p> <p>Around the same time Gove appeared as&#xa0;a&#xa0;chaplain in a feature film set in a&#xa0;boarding school. It was a tiny role, but&#xa0;he'd clearly made a big impression on someone along the way, because the lead schoolboy character was given the name M Gove. Neither the film nor A Stab In the Dark were huge hits, though, and in 1996 Gove joined the Times as a columnist and leader writer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783251\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283428073/Michael-Gove-on-an-NUJ-pi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on an NUJ picket line in 1989\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1989, while a trainee reporter on Aberdeen's Press And Journal, Gove joined an NUJ picket line. Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Stewart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newspaper offices are notoriously fractious places, but staff remember an extravagantly congenial, donnish colleague who would soothe reporters late filing copy with, \"But how <em>are</em> you? Yes, of course, should you so wish to file that would be marvellous, that would be very much appreciated. But it's first important that I&#xa0;know how you <em>are</em>.\" Very much the in-house intellectual, the \"most striking thing about him,\" recalls his former editor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stothard\" title=\"\">Peter Stothard</a>, \"was that he could make people on the other side of the argument not only recognise his argument, but also genuinely like him.\"</p> <p>Gove became friends with the rising young Tory stars Cameron, George Osborne and Steve Hilton, and co-founded the centre-right think tank <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Policy Exchange</a>. His influence over the party's modernisation project would be difficult to overstate. The exact nature of his contribution, however, is confusing. Everyone tells me his politics owe everything to his humble origins, and are \"all about creating ladders of opportunity; it's all about things you might call progressive, in terms of goals, but using Conservative means\". He is \"ideologically amphibious\", interested in ideas from the left, \"on a moral mission, to do with helping the poorest\", and responsible for helping to coax his party into the 21st century. Even his political opponents concur. According to a senior Labour party official, \"On sexuality and class and social mobility, on race and gender, he is&#xa0;a genuine liberal.\" He is not, Huhne agrees, \"a&#xa0;traditional rightwinger.\"</p> <p>Then I read every word published under his Times byline up to his election in 2005, and found&#xa0;that Gove the progressive arch-moderniser simply does not fit with the facts. If you want to understand what Tory modernisation really adds up to, it's a highly instructive read.</p> <p>Gove's neo-con hawkishness in foreign policy has always been well known. He called for the invasion of Iraq just two days after 9/11, and before the planes hit the towers he'd already published a column that morning calling for action against Saddam Hussein. A committed Zionist and slavish admirer of George W Bush, a&#xa0;passionate Eurosceptic and staunch defender of&#xa0;British Gibraltar, he regards the Northern Ireland peace process as a shameful capitulation to terrorists, and once wrote a column calling for&#xa0;\"a revival of jingoism\". But where is the evidence in his writing of domestic social liberalism? It doesn't exist.</p> <p>Passionately pro marriage, he opposes statutory paternity pay, stem cell research, euthanasia and contraception for school children, but supports privatisation of both the BBC and the NHS, and proposes the marketisation of immigration policy,&#xa0;whereby a British passport could, he suggests, be sold for \u00a310,000. He is far ruder about the Lib Dems than New Labour, despairs of the \"absurd belief\" that the armed forces ought to reflect the country they serve by recruiting more women and gay men, and takes a&#xa0;robustly bang-em-up approach to law and order. As for supporting public services, Gove can see only one acceptable line: \"The Conservatives could defend public servants from the unjust, unproven and demoralising charge of 'institutional racism',\" the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson report</a> being, in his view, an outrage.</p> <p>Why, then, do so many colleagues and political opponents see Gove in this rosier, more moderate light? It has to be because of his debater's gift for according courteous respect to opposing views, creating the impression that he's taken them on board, when he hasn't actually revised his position at all. Everyone tells me how carefully Gove listens, but when asked to recall a single occasion when he has been persuaded to change his mind, to their surprise no one can come up with one. It is a case of manners maketh the impression of a moderniser, for Gove's Tories don't need to be \"inclusive\", or \"tolerant\". The&#xa0;important thing is to look as if they are.</p> <p>He warns the party against \"Social Tone Deafness\", which \"manifests itself in an inability to detect the country's changing mood music\", and calls for candidates who \"look like human beings who understand the daily struggles of modern existence\". But a 2003 column tellingly reveals where Gove ranks the importance of actual policy reform: \"The Tories have not yet adopted a tone, style, culture <em>or even</em> [my italics] a set of policy priorities appropriate for the 21st century.\" A Tory minister and friend of Gove's probably comes closest to the truth when he characterises him as a \"true Conservative, the rightwing conscience of the cabinet. He is a full spectrum, real world Tory; it's all about living in the real world. He would regard the Tory rightwing as completely unrealistic\" \u2013 which is not the&#xa0;same as wrong. Labour MPs like to say Cameron's Conservatives have modernised on only one solitary issue \u2013 homophobia \u2013 and I&#xa0;used to think that had to be&#xa0;too cynical. But in all of Gove's writing it's the only example of an authentically abandoned prejudice.</p> <p>What of Gove's famous passion for social mobility through education? \"His view on social mobility is for people to do what he did \u2013 study classical subjects and go to Oxford,\" argues a Labour critic. \"It's all slightly 'Some working-class people are terribly good at Latin \u2013 give them a chance and you never know!'\" The former Labour schools minister Jim Knight agrees. \"If he thinks social mobility is getting more poor kids into Oxbridge, then I think that's a massively flawed definition. If you are serious about social mobility, it has to be communities and families, not just individuals.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, in 2000 Gove wrote, \"Too many people go to university\", but his columns reveal surprisingly little about the future secretary of state's thoughts on education. For their origins, we need to go back further still, to his old school days. \"He benefited in a life-changing way from a&#xa0;classical liberal education,\" as a close ally puts it, \"and would like that privilege to be extended to people from less privileged backgrounds.\"</p> <p>For all its architectural grandeur, Robert Gordon's College during Gove's era was actually Scotland's second cheapest private day school \u2013 \"more of a glorified grammar, really,\" as a former pupil puts it. About half the boys joined from state primaries, and a quarter received a bursary or scholarship. George Allan and Mike Duncan both assumed Gove had been a scholarship boy, but in fact it was only when his father's business failed in his final year that the family applied for assistance. But every boy had to pass the entrance exam, and the school could operate on the assumption that all pupils would be not merely able, but disposed to work hard.</p> <p>\"When you enter Gordon's and start wearing the blazer and tie, you sort of absorb the traditions of the college,\" a former teacher tells me. \"Those kids from poorer economic backgrounds tried to climb upwards, not pull the others down.\" When&#xa0;I&#xa0;ask Allan what sort of disciplinary problems he used to deal with, he looks surprised. \"Well, if I&#xa0;had one a term, that was enough for me.\" The current acting head says the worst he's encountered was a boy kicking about a plastic bottle who ignored his request to put it in the bin.</p> <p>Gove has always spoken highly of his old school, and when I visit I can see why. But while I'm admiring its orderly classrooms and general air of cheerful application, a teacher puts into words what I find myself thinking. \"The trouble with anyone's own experience of school,\" the teacher points out, \"is that it's so formative that it informs all your ideas about education. That's very natural, but not necessarily a good thing.\"</p> <p>From the age of 11, Gove never shared a desk with anyone who struggled to read and write, or who experienced school as&#xa0;an intimidating trauma instead of a golden ticket. \"His prime concern is to make sure&#xa0;that there are safe schools in cities for people&#xa0;like him,\" says a columnist who has followed his career closely. \"All this nonsense that&#xa0;free schools are free \u2013 they are not, they are Michael Gove schools. He is trying to create a system in which middle-class parents like him can make uses of the state system without having&#xa0;to mix with the rough boys.\"</p> <p>Following his election in 2005, Gove wrote, \"The&#xa0;reason why I'm in Parliament is not really to see my colleagues win power, it is to see us at last in a position where we can give it up.\"</p> <p>But since taking office, he has awarded himself more than 50&#xa0;new powers, including rules allowing him to acquire land from local authorities and private companies to help him increase the number of academies and free schools. This autumn 55 new free schools will open, taking the total to 80, and the number of academies has risen tenfold to more than 2,300, each one accountable not to local authorities, but to the secretary of state himself. \"He is a High Tory control freak who wants to run every school in the country,\" counters the critic of Gove's \"free\" school rhetoric. \"He hasn't got a localist bone in his body.\"</p> <p>There are other curious paradoxes. A friend for more than 20 years has never once heard him mention money, and says he regards it with unworldly indifference. But in 2002 Gove wrote about living perennially beyond his means \u2013 \"Ever since going up to university, I&#xa0;have accumulated new debt, and new means of becoming indebted\". And when the expenses scandal broke, it emerged that he'd spent \u00a37,000 of taxpayers' money on designer furniture, much of it from Cameron's mother-in-law's interior design company.</p> <p>Another puzzle was his use of private email addresses to communicate with his team. Everyone says Gove has a practically courtly deference to protocol, but he was plainly breaking the rules. Gove pleaded an innocent failure to master his own departmental technology, and his physical ineptitude is legendary; being driven by Gove is, apparently, a \"terrifying\" experience. Whether techno-klutziness explains an arrangement that conveniently kept secrets from hostile civil servants, however, is unclear.</p> <p>For a man known to be meticulously conscientious, Gove's ministerial career got off to an oddly bumpy start. In the early months, he drew criticism for awarding a grant to a Jewish schools security trust on whose advisory body he had sat [see footnote], and then there was the botched cancellation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Schools_for_the_Future\" title=\"\">Building Schools For The Future</a> programme, and confusion over the number of schools wishing to become academies. Gove blamed sabotage by his own department \u2013 in a colleague's words, a \"ministerial blooding\". But last year he hired a special adviser who'd been previously blackballed by Andy Coulson, called Dominic Cummings. \"And you could almost feel,\" says a senior aide, \"that the moment Dom came to join him, things started getting back on track.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year, Gove leaked to the Daily Mail his plan to restore O-Levels, sidestepping departmental and Lib Dem opposition to court the rightwing press, whose praise was predictably rapturous. Issuing every school in the country with a leather-bound King James bible inscribed with the words, \"Presented by the secretary of state for education\" surely did more for Gove's profile than&#xa0;for the nation's spiritual improvement. At \u00a3370,000, it was a pricey gesture, but private donors comprised almost exclusively of rightwing Christian financiers were happy to foot the whole bill. Gove's other big idea this year was pricier still \u2013 a new \u00a360m royal yacht for the Queen as a diamond jubilee present. It was clearly never going to happen, but sent another signal to the right, as did his audacious hymn at the Leveson enquiry to the virtues of \"one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years\", Rupert Murdoch. \"Cummings is a really amazingly effective political street fighter,\" the aide says, \"the wily operator he needed. Since then, Michael has felt a new sense of confidence.\"</p> <p>Gove's confidence extends well beyond his existing role. Most cabinet ministers haven't the energy or political courage to discuss their colleagues' policies in any detail; Gove isn't one of them. \"Michael does have an opinion on everything,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timmontgomerie\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie</a>, editor of <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home</a>, \"and he talks in cabinet a lot.\" One cabinet minister describes him as \"being slightly inclined to go off on a bit of a rant off his own brief\", and an aide describes his role as the \"energetic challenger \u2013 especially of the system, and of conventional wisdom\". And yet, says another minister firmly, \"I can't think of anyone who sees him as a political rival.\"</p> <p>How could Gove possibly not be seen as a political rival? He may be Osborne's closest ally, but in the opinion of one Lib Dem minister is \"substantially cleverer\". He is Cameron's \"closest&#xa0;friend in politics\", helping him prepare for PMQs, feeding jokes into his speeches, and he&#xa0;\"can be quite dazzlingly funny, brilliant at doing impressions\", a friend reports. \"I've heard him do what must be a set piece, in which he does a great impression of Huhne condescending to Clegg in cabinet, that had the whole table in stitches. Genuinely funny satire.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397783252\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349282180167/Michael-Gove-on-a-New-Yea-008.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Gove on a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On a New Year's Day walk in 2011 with the Cameron family and friends, including Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter.

They&#xa0;are in and out of each other's houses, kids and nannies everywhere, they are each others' kids' godparents, their kids go to the same schools. The question of succession doesn't cross their minds.\"</p> <p>The question is whether it crosses Gove's.</p> <p>Just how far does Gove's ambition go? \"At&#xa0;Oxford it was obvious that some people were warming up for the Commons,\" Samira Ahmed recalls. \"With&#xa0;Boris Johnson, his plan was obvious. But I&#xa0;never heard that said about Michael.\" Former colleagues at the Times assumed for a&#xa0;while that he would become their editor, \"But he wasn't seen as someone angling for his own personal promotion at all.\" Gove has always insisted he has no interest in leading his party, saying, \"I&#xa0;don't have it in me. I don't have what it takes.\" And yet, as Matthew d'Ancona observes, \"You can&#xa0;never assume that a politician who has devoted his life to the game will walk away from the chance to be leader or PM. It's ridiculous for us to think that any politician might.\"</p> <p>A lot of very wealthy Tories presumably agree, for Gove's constituency office last year received five times the party's national average sum of donations. Individual and corporate donors gave&#xa0;Gove, who occupies one of the safest seats in the country, more than \u00a360,000 \u2013 almost twice the sum received by Osborne's office and three times more than Cameron's. What exactly are they funding?</p> <p>Nobody believes Gove would ever challenge Cameron for the leadership. And Gove had always&#xa0;assumed that, when the succession did come, the heir would be Osborne. But now that&#xa0;the chancellor is becoming unelectably damaged goods, and talk of a Johnson leadership bid gathers momentum, few think Gove would simply stand by and watch London's mayor move&#xa0;into Downing Street. If the party needs a&#xa0;Stop Boris candidate, it will be Gove.</p> <p>Does he have what it takes? Former colleagues are unsure. \"He is an intellectual, not a man of&#xa0;the&#xa0;people, and whether he could operate in&#xa0;an&#xa0;environment in which not very many people knew who <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew\" title=\"\">Spiro Agnew</a> was I don't know.\"&#xa0;I ask his old boss, and Stothard chuckles. \"I think by common consent the job of home news editor wasn't his natural home. News editors, unless they're hated half the time, are not&#xa0;really on top of their job. Was Michael able to&#xa0;do the throwing the typewriter thing? No. He&#xa0;didn't have the temperament for that role. I&#xa0;don't really believe in pop psychology, so I'm reluctant to go into this very far, but he is quite thin-skinned. Perhaps too sensitive to be home news editor \u2013 or prime minister.\"</p> <p>Someone else who knows Gove well agrees that at first he tended to flap when things didn't&#xa0;go smoothly. \"This 'I haven't got what it takes' line, I think what he was referring to was this thing of coping with the ups and downs and the crap you get. The relentless roller-coaster and inevitable failures. He previously might have been a bit insecure about his ability to cope&#xa0;with adversity, but I think that has gone now. I think that has changed. If you'd asked me&#xa0;18 months ago, do you think he could and should aim to be PM one day, I would have said&#xa0;no. But now I think Michael could.\" There's&#xa0;some speculation that the decision will ultimately fall to his wife, the Times columnist <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tag/sarah-vine\" title=\"\">Sarah Vine</a>, but no agreement on which way she'll go.</p> <p>\"I think she adores being a Tory wife,\" says one friend. \"The more pictures she can be in with Sam Cam, the better her life becomes.\" But another disagrees. \"I've heard people say that, but I don't think she's a scheming Machiavellian political wife, pushing her husband's career.\" She has a funny way of going about it if she is, featuring marital anecdotes in her column that render him a faintly absurd eccentric.</p> <p>The couple met at the Times, married in 2001, and live with their daughter and son, nine and seven, in a modest terraced house at the Wormwood Scrubs end of North Kensington, where dinner is \"a standard middle-class set up; completely informal, non matching furniture, child-centred, you can't move for books, the kids are usually up.

There is a gap there.\"</p> <p>But Gove has never looked for his birth mother, and says he never will, out of loyalty to the parents who raised him. \"He is just not a very conflicted person,\" another friend offers simply. \"I don't think there's a great deal of inner turmoil there. He regards life as having smiled on him.\"</p> <p>Gove has always been good-humoured about his place in the party's popularity stakes. In fact, he's so accustomed to coming second as the party faithful's choice of after-dinner speaker, he likes to joke that on his gravestone will be carved the words: \"They Couldn't Get Boris.\" But though Johnson's sense of humour has got him a long way so far, few would bet on him having the last laugh. \"If you had told me Boris Johnson was going to be mayor of London,\" reflects Anthony Goodman, their fellow ex-Oxford union president, \"I definitely would have laughed at you. If you had told me Michael Gove was going to be in government, I would have thought that was pretty obvious.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was added on 15 October 2012.

  "<p>The first words I heard were \"Welcome home\", and then I was swallowed up in an energetic hug from the feisty and voluptuous Mama Connie. I had just arrived at the Ngala Safari Lodge, which was to be my South African base for five days.</p> <p>Set in a dense thicket of mopane and tamboti trees, Ngala is the sort of place many photographers dream about: perfect for chasing the Big Five and capturing the kind of wildlife only Africa can offer.</p> <p>Ngala was the first private game reserve to be incorporated into Kruger national park and has exclusive traversing rights on more than 37,000 acres of one of the richest wildlife reserves in southern Africa.</p> <p>I had been awarded the opportunity to spend time there after winning the yearly Guardian Been there readers' travel photography competition in 2011, and could not wait to put my camera to work.</p> <p>The prize included five days of safari drives. In our private vehicle, my husband and I \u2013 plus an expert tracker and a specialist photography guide \u2013 had two opportunities a day to find the right locations for capturing images of the animals.</p> <p>The two guides I worked with over the course of the week, Robin and Pieter, who work for tour company &amp;Beyond, both offered lots of tips really useful for a wildlife photography novice like me.</p> <p>The land blessed us as guests and provided many wonderful wildlife sightings on our drives: lazy leopards draped across tree branches, cheetahs stalking their prey as impala scattered back and forth like dizzy spinning tops, elephants plodding through the burnt-looking landscape, and the king of the plains, the majestic lion, slowly making his way through the long grass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397257280\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/4/1349371741406/Elvis-Cubayi-expert-anima-001.jpg\" alt=\"Elvis Cubayi, expert animal tracker, has worked at Ngala since 1994\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elvis Cubayi, expert animal tracker, has worked at Ngala since 1994</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm a keen amateur photographer and usually focus on human portraiture, but I quickly found myself looking for the spark in the eyes of my animal subjects and for that magical moment when they turned to face the camera.</p> <p>I learned a lot about patience: one of the top tips given by &amp;Beyond guide Robin was to position myself well in a spot with access to the golden dawn light and then wait for the animal to turn to face me. Many safari guests will spend a lot of time chasing animals in their vehicles but forget the essentials of a good photograph.</p> <p>I also learned to use my other senses a lot more: a sudden sound might offer a clue to a new animal sighting, or you could ruin a great photo opportunity by being downwind when a shy and reclusive leopard comes by.</p> <p>Wildlife photography engages all the senses in a way human portraiture does not and the earthy smell of potato bushes and the melodious sound of the natural environment carrying on with its daily business provided a backdrop to the photography, which soon became addictive.</p> <p>The local community has close links with Ngala, and &amp;Beyond works in partnership with conservation body the <a href=\"http://www.africafoundation.org/about/\" title=\"\">Africa Foundation</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397257281\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/4/1349363542811/Children-in-nursery-in--001.jpg\" alt=\"Children in nursery in \" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children in a nursery school funded by the Africa Foundation in Welverdiend.

  "<p>\"Keep an eye out for John Travolta!\" laughs our driver, as we peer out of the taxi window, hoping to spot a warthog or two in the African bush. We are on our way to the swish Shamwari Game Reserve in South Africa's Eastern Cape, one of the world's leading luxury safari destinations, and occasional retreat for various species of celebrity.</p> <p>Shamwari has not only won award after award for its conservation efforts and impeccable hospitality record, it has somehow even managed to keep the hordes of the online review community happy. Slightly perturbed by the gushing reviews of the place (one reviewer even claimed to be overcome with tears of happiness when remembering his experience), I have a slight niggle before we arrive that I may not get the rugged and authentic safari experience I've been looking forward to.</p> <p>My boyfriend Tony and I arrive at Shamwari with only 10 minutes until our first game drive. Our ranger, Ryan, gives a passionate introduction to the reserve, explaining the rich and diverse ecosystem (which contains five out of the seven South African \"biomes\") within a 25,000-hectare malaria-free plot. He asks our newly formed group of six what we'd like to see most and on the face of it seems enthused by our almost collective response \u2013 lions.</p> <p>Ryan's genuine enthusiasm for what he does is matched by the speed at which he drives. We skid down valleys, bounce out of our seatbelts and streak through mud in pursuit of a dot on the horizon. The land is thick with pine bushes, like huge oversized brittle dandelions, positioned against the dense green vegetation and scorched red soil. The bush is vast and stark, and there is a simple pleasure in feeling lost and small within it.</p> <p>Shamwari's well-managed system, whereby rangers radio each other with key sightings, means that after a couple of drives we've been about a metre away from most of the big five. Highlights included: seeing the elephant calf feeding from its mother (a reminder that there really is milk and flesh inside these massive clay units); the agility of the baby rhino (so swift and light of foot I felt I could blow her one-tonne weight over in one breath); and feeling trapped by a leopard's fixed glare as we intruded on her mating territory (which quickly turned the usual zoo dynamic of \"the viewer\" and \"the viewed\" on its head).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403849812\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283001588/Spot-the-local---a-leopar-001.jpg\" alt=\"Spot the local \u2026 a leopard crosses the tourists\u2019 track\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spot the local \u2026 a leopard crosses the tourists\u2019 track</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Janette Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The natural excitement of being outdoors and on the game drive is amplified by brilliant stage management by the Shamwari staff. We break for lunch in the middle of the bush, to find a table, ready-laid with silver cutlery, champagne and enough fresh food to keep us going for a week. We return from another game drive, bones cold from the wind, to ostrich crudit\u00e9s, hot towels and Decleor facials. The transition between creature and comfort is so seamless you have to remind yourself that it isn't every day you stop to have a G&amp;T at sundown in a field of impala.</p> <p>Shamwari has luxury accommodation in six lodges, and also offers a back-to-basics option in its Explorer Camp. We're staying at Bayethe Lodge, described as \"luxury tented accommodation\". It is more akin to a Grand Designs thatched house: creatively laid out (a six-metre-high spire roof, freestanding bath and plunge pool), with nice touches (spotlights entwined in branches above our bed, and our pillows arranged like flowers).</p> <p>Evenings alternate between private dinners and group <em>braais</em> (barbecues, with our ranger). At the latter we talk about safaris: the high costs, the pressure on land, the need to control animal numbers to maintain the delicate ecosystem, the push to provide employment to local South Africans. Shamwari is home to indigenous wildlife only, and even at full capacity the reserve accommodates relatively few guests, to ensure the land is preserved and reclaimed as much as possible. Behind the scenes Shamwari also has a breeding centre, an anti-poaching unit, a rehabilitation centre for abandoned or injured animals and an education facility which partners with local schools in the area.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-403849813\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349283040519/Creatures-and-comforts----001.jpg\" alt=\"Creatures and comforts \u2026 Bayethe Lodge\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creatures and comforts \u2026 Bayethe Lodge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the luxury and scale of Shamwari, the rangers are the stars of the show. Ryan's genuine love of the environment shines through any manufactured feel. His admiration for the whole ecosystem ensures that this is not just a whistlestop tour around the Big Five. We chew <em>spekboom</em> \u2013 a succulent known as elephant bush \u2013 and understand from its sweet taste why elephants like it so much, we taste aloe, hold dung from black and white rhino in our hands to learn how to spot evidence of the black rhino's hooked upper lip and \"browser\" diet. Ryan's skilled at teaching us to slow down, appreciate whatever comes our way and challenge our own preconceptions of what we will enjoy most.</p> <p>When we go on a trail walk, the dramatic belly of the bush comes to life and for a couple of hours we become part of the landscape. There is a huge variety of birdlife at Shamwari and the trail walk lets us experience the flame-licked wings of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knysna_Turaco\" title=\"\">Knysna touraco</a>, the guttural blare of the heron and the orange belly of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/jan/01/3\" title=\"\">Malachite kingfisher</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Towards the end of the week the drives become more relaxed. We spend half an hour listening to the melancholy call of the African fish eagle; we opt for watching springbok leaping into the air (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5IJBbA6UkA\" title=\"\">pronking</a>) over a rumoured leopard sighting; we track a lion by following her footprints and trying to analyse the behaviour of the antelope that are spread out around her. When we eventually find her we follow her until it gets dark.</p> <p>In our taxi to the airport the driver asks if we saw Prince William or Oprah Winfrey. Despite experiencing all the luxuries that Shamwari has to offer, it's the first time all week that I'm reminded of my earlier concerns about a sanitized safari experience.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Janette Smith won in the accommodation category in the 2011 competition.

  "<p>David Moyes received another text from Tim Cahill last Saturday evening. \"That was fantastic,\" was the verdict from New York on Everton's emphatic recovery against Southampton. Only a fool would have disagreed. Cahill joined Red Bulls in the summer but it is his former club who have been given wings.</p> <p>Second in the table and more importantly at this stage, playing with a confidence and style not witnessed at Goodison Park for many a year, Everton's start has attracted admiration from the Australia international and beyond. \"He's been in touch after games two or three times this season,\" says Moyes. \"Apparently he thinks he's mayor of New York now. I'll probably take the team out to see him in New York if I get the chance.\" The longer-term incentive is a journey into Europe.</p> <p>With 13 points from six league games, Everton have responded to criticism of their repeated poor starts and produced an identical points tally to 2004-05 when they reached the Champions League qualifiers. But it has been done in a more expansive, entertaining and adventurous fashion than when nine 1-0 wins helped them to fourth eight years ago. Moyes's team head for Wigan Athletic on Saturday with an average of 21 goalscoring chances per away game.</p> <p>The Everton manager admits: \"I think there is a difference in the quality but we had really good players then, good senior players, and if you said the quality is better now I'm sure they would rebut that. The challenge I am setting to the boys now is can you be as consistent as the team from 2004-05? That is part of the battle.</p> <p>\"You can win with flair but we won a lot of games 1-0 that year. We were consistent, hard to beat. There are different ways of skinning a cat. We are in good form just now but how long can we keep it going? It is a test of the players to keep reaching those standards.\"</p> <p>In Cahill, Lee Carsley, Duncan Ferguson, Alan Stubbs and co, Everton were not short on character when they last competed at the top. Moyes sees no difference today. \"Spirit exists here and it has grown,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Spirit is in the DNA of the club, it is in the building and I think it is around Goodison Park. A lot of that keeps Everton going. I think people walk into Everton and there is an energy, the sense of a working club and a good atmosphere. That is a good environment to work in.\"</p> <p>The recovery from a fractured start to last season on and off the pitch began in January when the sale of Diniyar Bilyaletdinov helped fund the signings of Darron Gibson and Nikica Jelavic. Steven Pienaar, left, arrived on loan, then permanently in the summer from Tottenham Hotspur, and has been joined by Kevin Mirallas, Steven Naismith and Bryan Oviedo. Jack Rodwell apart, the squad remained intact this summer and there is arguably more depth and attacking options available to Moyes than at any time during his decade in charge.</p> <p>\"A little bit of money, a little bit of changing around and a bit of wheeling and dealing have made a big difference,\" he explains. \"The squad was getting older so we brought younger players in and changed the age group.\" But, and as an early League Cup exit at Leeds illustrated, there is cause for caution amid the optimism and praise.</p> <p>As Moyes, who has been named manager of the month for September, adds: \"The balance of the team is good but the squad could still be a bit light. That, in the end, could catch me out. We are still short of central-midfield players and if you're talking about a squad to compete at the top end of the Premier League, I'm worried we are not going to have that level.\"</p> <p>Moyes has appeared far more relaxed this season \u2013 though he is out of contract next summer and yet to sign an extension \u2013 and his team seem more ambitious. Yet after a summer when talk of a move to Tottenham proved only that, he denies there has been an overhaul in his managerial philosophy.</p> <p>He states: \"Folk think I'm defensive but I was brought up on the best attacking team ever in terms of style and what was demanded, Glasgow Celtic. I have also played under coaches who showed me another style. I want my team in the opponents' half having shots. I've only been brought up that way and no other way. But you can only win games with the tools you have available and if you don't have them you need to find other ways of winning. Otherwise I wouldn't still be in the job.</p> <p>\"I didn't have the tools to win that way five or six years ago. What I have had is time to get to the point where I am now being asked about being entertaining.\"</p>",
  "<p>For the England women's cricket team, the beginning of the slog to the summit can probably be traced back to 5 May 2010, a disastrous day on St Kitts, when they played Australia in a group match of the World Twenty20, Murphy's Law kicked in, and anything that could go wrong did, and did so in spades. The result was the tightest imaginable, with scores finishing level, a super-over eliminator doing likewise, and Australia deemed winners on countback because of the single six struck earlier in the match by their batsman Jess Cameron.</p> <p>It does not however tell the story of the complete mess England made of that match, in which Clare Taylor, the world's leading female batsman, was run out without facing a ball and then unaccountably flagged through to the wicketkeeper the first ball of the super over. Nor does it tell of the England captain Charlotte Edwards, not a regular bowler, deciding to bowl the last over of the match herself, with eight runs needed, sending down a high full toss first ball, which was dispatched to the boundary.</p> <p>It was an appallingly executed match by a team who held the World Cup and the World T20 titles and were strong favourites to retain the latter. Having lost that match, and deflated by the performance, they then lost to West Indies and were eliminated from the competition having not even reached the semi-finals.</p> <p>Since then, progress in T20 cricket, the best format for women's cricket, has been little short of astonishing. In July of that year, they twice were beaten at home by New Zealand, but since then, they have lost only twice \u2013 to Australia in Canberra last year, and to West Indies in their last home game of last summer \u2013 in 33 matches.</p> <p>It is a run of success quite possibly unprecedented by any British team, male or female, in any sport, and it makes Edwards arguably the nation's most prolific leader of all. From it Sarah Taylor has emerged, in her capacity as a wicketkeeper-batsman of genuine first-class standard, as arguably the best female cricketer of all time, and the astounding Lydia Greenway as its finest fielder. England have kept ahead of the game and intend to continue doing so.</p> <p>There is a story here of the benefits of proper funding and investment, a challenging mission statement, massively increased security and status for the players, increased participation levels and therefore more competition for places, and, crucially, a top flight academy and performance programme.</p> <p>Players are not yet centrally contracted (although that may come eventually, the current fear being only that there simply would not be enough to do) but most are in cricket-related employment for 100 days of the year. Seven players work as coaches and ambassadors for Chance to Shine, the organisation that takes cricket into schools, and 12, including Sarah Taylor and Dani Wyatt, are on the MCC groundstaff from April to September, as part of the MCC Women Young Cricketers programme, delivered by the England Women's coach Mark Lane, a superb coach utterly empathetic to the demands of female cricket.</p> <p>From cricket, when factoring in touring fees, allowances and match fees that can be doubled by winning, Clare Connor, the former England captain and now the England and Wales Cricket Board's director of women's cricket, reckons that for 100 days pro-rata, the top players' earnings are more than in any other female team sport in the UK.</p> <p>The support of the ECB has been crucial. Since Connor presented a paper to the board several years ago, everything, within reason, has been put in place, to the envy of other less well resourced nations. The women's game is flourishing. Edwards and others have been involved in Chance to Shine since 2008 and by this year they had introduced more than one million children to the game of which 48% have been girls, 160,000 of them this year alone. In a decade, the number of clubs with women's sections has grown from 93 to 560. Every one of the 39 county cricket boards has age group girls teams at U17, U15 and U13 level. Connor has at her disposal a team of 12 selectors and scouts on a regional basis, with a sophisticated talent identification system and data base.</p> <p>Competition to get into the national side is fierce. In Connor's time, up until 2005, there was little: the team was all but set in stone. Now there is a stringent path to follow, involving the best identified 52 over-16 county players competing in the Super 4s programme, in which they are each allocated one of four equally balanced teams who then play each other in both T20 and 50 over matches. Connor estimates they now have 20 players competing for squad places, each capable of playing in a final eleven. Such is the depth of ability that this summer the Academy team beat the national teams of West Indies and Pakistan.</p> <p>The drive to improve has been relentless. In preparation for global tournaments, England and the academy have played as much cricket as possible in different environments including Sri Lanka. Their training camps are intensive and include strength and conditioning, skills, nutrition, spin, diving techniques in the field, sweeping and all the small things that make a difference. In short, they are successful in no small part because they are better prepared.</p> <p>But herein lies one overriding problem: the better they become, the less challenged they are. Two teams \u2013 England and Australia \u2013 dominate, with West Indies, India and New Zealand a tier below, and the remainder below them.</p> <p>When Australia's men's team reached that level of domination they included their A team in their own tournaments and concocted a game against the Rest of the World. For the integrity of women's international cricket the ICC, through investment, needs to close the competitive gap, through following the England model, helping create more bilateral cricket and robust domestic competitions.</p> <p>That, though, will not stop the England drive to remain at the top. The more input they give them, says Connor, the more they want. \"They are hungry for success. It is what drives them.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has failed to end the Tories' image as the party of the rich and is paying the price as Conservatives struggle to extend their appeal to urban areas in the north of England, according to the head of Downing Street's favourite thinktank.</p> <p>In a searing critique of the prime minister's faltering modernisation project, the director of Policy Exchange, Neil O'Brien, calls for an urgent round of renewal in the light of Cameron's failure to heal the \"party's worst wounds\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/conservatives-new-workers-party\" title=\"\">Writing for the Guardian on the eve of the Conservative conference</a> in Birmingham, O'Brien says: \"The Tories urgently need a new round of renewal. Tory modernisation has not yet healed the party's worst wounds. It is still seen as the party of the rich. It does badly in urban areas, particularly outside the south-east.\"</p> <p>The intervention by O'Brien, whose thinktank has been an intellectual powerhouse for so-called \"Cameroons\", reflects the concerns among many modernisers that the project to detoxify the image of the Tories has stalled. It was designed to show that the Tories, who were famously described in 2002 by Theresa May, now the home secretary, as the \"nasty party\", reflected modern, diverse Britain. Cameron famously broke with the past, and highlighted his green credentials, by posing with huskies on a visit to Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic in 2006.</p> <p>On Friday, in another blow for the government, Europe's environment chief highlighted concerns in the EU that the coalition is failing to live up to its pledge to become Britain's greenest ever government by accusing critics of environmental regulations of making \"untrue\" claims.</p> <p>Janez Potocnik, the European environment commissioner, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/05/tories-warned-eu-green-agenda\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> that for politicians to suggest that environmental legislation was a burden was \"very unhelpful, because it is untrue\".</p> <p>The commissioner did not name any Tory ministers. But chancellor George Osborne has criticised green regulations.</p> <p>Separately, in a Guardian interview before the Conservative conference, the new culture secretary, Maria Miller, claimed the government was acting in a progressive way as it lifts 2 million of the lowest earners out of tax.</p> <p>Miller, who is also minister for women and equalities, said: \"When you look at what we have been doing for the last two and a half years, so much of it does resonate with women. If you look at what we have done in terms of focusing on cutting the deficit, welfare reform and tax reforms \u2013 lifting 2 million of the lowest paid people out of tax altogether disproportionately supports women who can often have part-time jobs.\"</p> <p>Miller declined to join the campaign to end the Sun's Page 3 girl, saying: \"It is for newspapers to decide what they print and it is for consumers to decide what they buy. That is the way it should be, and I don't think it is right for ministers to dictate what goes on any page of a newspaper, whether it is page 3 or not.\"</p> <p>In his Guardian article, O'Brien calls for \"blue collar modernisation\" focused on the north and the Midlands which would see the end of middle-class benefits. \"What about middle-class benefits?\" he asks. \"Do we really need to give child benefit to households that are better off than average? Post-election we should stop giving free TV licences, winter fuel payments and bus passes to millionaires.\"</p> <p>O'Brien says the prime minister must resist calls from the Tory right, notably the new Conservative Voice group, to champion a more traditional agenda.</p> <p>\"Obviously Cameron should ignore calls from the usual suspects to lurch rightward. But the solution isn't as simple as tacking to the centre. After all, most voters have tough views on crime, welfare and immigration.

  "<p><strong>Tesco</strong> fell to a two-month low on Friday in a rising market, as investors checked out of the supermarket group's shares in the wake of its first profit fall for 20 years.</p> <p>The company reported half-year figures on Wednesday showing trading profits dropped 10.5% to \u00a31.6bn, prompting concerns about its poor UK performance and growing problems in its international business. It closed down 2.8p at 315.35p on Friday, its worst level since the start of August as analysts queued up to downgrade the business. Kate Calvert and Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said: \"The market was prepared for a decline in profits from Tesco, but we believe its first-half results were disappointing even in that context.

As Fehrnstrom famously put it back in March: \"You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.\"</p> <p>In the first presidential TV debate with President Obama on Wednesday night, and in subsequent media appearances, the former governor of Massachusetts has made several sharp changes in tack that have left seasoned Romney observers flabbergasted. The most dramatic was on Thursday night, when during an interview on Fox News he completely denounced his own notorious comments in a private fundraiser that 47% of the American people were dependent on government.</p> <p>In the firestorm that followed <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">Mother Jones's publication of the remarks</a>, Romney tried to stand by them, saying they were correct albeit inelegantly put. But on Thursday night he ditched them entirely, saying: \"In this case, I said something that's just completely wrong.\"</p> <p>The U-turn was in the spirit of his performance in the previous night's presidential debate, in which he displayed similarly breathtaking revisions to policy positions that he has been projecting on the campaign trail for at least 18 months.</p> <p>On tax, having spent the entire Republican primary season trying to convince the fiscally conservative Tea Party that he could be trusted to cut taxes for all Americans including the super-rich, he said: \"I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people [who are] doing just fine.\"</p> <p>Having spent months attacking government red tape for cramping the creativity of the free market, he announced that he now believed that: \"Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation.\"</p> <p>And having tub-thumped consistently on the campaign trail against Obamacare, he attempted to embrace the most popular aspects of the Affordable Health Care Act. \"I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions,\" he said, referring to the provision in the legislation that prevents insurance companies rejecting such patients.</p> <p>He even praised his own healthcare reforms in Massachusetts as a \"model for the nation, state by state\". In the past, Romney has tended to avoid talking about his healthcare record as governor because it is seen by many arch conservatives as evidence of his closet liberal tendencies.</p> <p>Obama has been criticised by pundits of both left and right for failing to point out his opponent's nimble footwork on Wednesday night. But he's been trying to make up for the omission in speeches delivered since. At a rally in Fairfax Virginia on Friday morning, Obama accused Romney of \"trying to do a two-step, to have an extreme makeover\".</p> <p>Political observers have reacted to Romney's energetic shift to the centre with surprise; not that he has made the move in itself, but that he has made it so late in the election cycle. The political analyst Larry Sabato said: \"Romney has completely ignored until now Richard Nixon's advice \u2013 go right for the primary season and then scramble back to the middle for the general election. He is only now scrambling back.\"</p> <p>Michael Wissot, a senior strategist with Luntz Global, who advised John McCain in his presidential run against Obama in 2008, said: \"I am very surprised that this strategy has been put into place so late. As governor he had a very strong record of bi-partisanship in Massachusetts where he courted Democrats to achieve results.\"</p> <p>One explanation for the time delay between Fehrnstrom's hailing of Romney the Etch A Sketch six months ago and the emergence of such a candidate just four weeks before election day has been his persistent difficulties with his own Republican base. He has struggled to convince rightwing conservatives who hold sway at many levels of the party that he can be trusted to carry their convictions into the White House should he win on 6 November.</p> <p>But there are signs that following his confident and assertive performance at the first debate, the doubters are finally coming on board. William Kristol, editor of the rightwing Weekly Standard and a long-time critic of Romney, <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/podcast-kristol-reacts-first-presidential-debate_653619.html\">conceded after the debate</a> that there was a need for him to be \"somewhat reassuring about what he would do as president, which is important for independent swing voters who are not 100% behind the conservative agenda\".</p> <p>That other thorn in Romney's side, Rush Limbaugh, gushed that \"this was one of the best debate performances in my life\". Erik Erickson, editor of the blog Red State, tweeted the day after the debate: \"Mitt Romney may be an Etch a Sketch, but it beats the hell out of Obama's whack-a-mole from last night.\"</p>",
  "<p>The coalition government is precarious. It has slender claim to democratic legitimacy. Yet, somehow, it has been accepted as an immovable part of the&#xa0;political landscape, something the UK is stuck with until a&#xa0;general election trundles around, under the coalition's own Fixed Term Parliament Act. Labour, despite its warnings about the damage being wreaked by an incompetent and feckless administration, seems happy to bide its time. Of course, this makes sense in party terms \u2013 plenty of time to prepare and raise election cash, plenty of time for the Lib Dems to destroy themselves and for the Conservatives to lose the \"economic credibility\" on which their ideological gamble is based. But, God, how I wish Labour had the courage and&#xa0;confidence to act out of immediate conviction, not long-term political advantage, and call the coalition's bluff.</p> <p>To win a vote of no confidence against this \"incompetent, out-of-touch, U-turning, make-it-up-as-you-go-along, miserable shower\", the Labour leadership would obviously have to throw a lifeline to the Liberal Democrats. This would be anathema to&#xa0;many tribal Labour members and supporters, who now hate the Lib Dems more than they do the Tories.</p> <p>But this is not sensible. It leaves the Lib Dems with no alternative but to cling to the Conservatives, unable to exercise any ameliorative influence at all, because they are trapped, and the Tories know it. The Conservatives have no need to appease the Lib Dems any longer. They understand perfectly well that without help from Labour, the Lib&#xa0;Dems can only bring down the coalition in a blazing act of annihilating martyrdom. And they know that Labour are not going to provide that help.</p> <p>But it's nice to dream. Certainly, it would not be difficult for the Lib Dems to come up with some good reasons for withdrawing from the coalition, marginalised and manipulated as they have been. Even they must see their reasons for leaving would be stronger than their reasons for staying, which look thinner and more strained by the day. Everyone, surely, understands that the main Lib Dem reason for staying is now simple fear \u2013 fear of facing the consequences of their uncomfortable situation under a leader who many of them feel has been naive, foolish, reckless and vain, and fear that with the end of the coalition comes also the end of the Lib Dems.</p> <p>But what if that fear was assuaged, just a bit? It would be simple for Labour and the Lib Dems to mount a successful no-confidence vote against the government, with the understanding that Labour and the Lib Dems would not&#xa0;stand against each other in certain key seats (though not the seats of their respective leaders), and that there would be a place at the cabinet table for&#xa0;a few of them. Surely it's got to be better than another couple of years of blustering Cameron and smirking Osborne, amassing donations as they carve up state services among their wealthy supporters, making a mockery of the tiny bit of a democratic voice that the electorate in this country gets?</p> <p>In truth, Labour isn't in that much of&#xa0;a hurry, isn't that bold, or principled, or prepared. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband's One Nation speech</a> earlier this week? Lauded as it may have been, I'm still appalled by it. Far from being a call to arms, it was a call to complacency \u2013 and one that was enthusiastically answered. It is utterly ridiculous to lavish praise on a putative national leader simply because he is able to relax before a sympathetic audience and waffle on about National Unity and&#xa0;Me without notes.</p> <p>Frankly, if he'd needed notes to deliver that lot, it would have been considerably more surprising. If that marked Miliband out as a Great Leader, then Stewart Lee should be president of the planet. Neither Labour nor the media listened to that speech and thought: \"This man should be in charge right now. This is urgent.\" On the contrary, his supporters seemed relieved that there was plenty of time for him \u2013 and them \u2013 to work out how One Nation could be practically applied in the context of an international economy in crisis. Except that there isn't actually enough time, and there never will be. You could spend for ever trying to translate that lot into workable policy, and still draw a blank.</p> <p>It's not a time for Britain to indulge itself in exceptionalist fantasies. This is a time for this country to look around, and grasp that nearly every other European country \u2013 and the US \u2013 is&#xa0;in the same situation as the UK. This is&#xa0;no national crisis, with national solutions. It is a global crisis, and Miliband's failure to mention Europe, let&#xa0;alone the rest of the world, suggests that he is nowhere near facing that, let&#xa0;alone addressing it.</p> <p>Britain is by no means the only country that is finding it hard to provide employment for its population. The coalition is not the only government imposing cuts in response to the crisis. If Labour and Miliband really do feel that they have a plausible alternative to austerity, one that they truly believe in, then it is staggeringly irresponsible for them to be keeping it to themselves. Even if they feel confident that they can&#xa0;manage the cuts better, then they should be concentrating forensically on&#xa0;making that case, right now. On the contrary, Miliband has barely been seen in recent weeks. It's a fair bet that an awful lot of time and energy has been lavished on practising that speech.</p> <p>In truth, Miliband's fantasy is not so&#xa0;different to Cameron's. Both parties invert the relationship between work and welfare. Cameron believes that if you remove state support, then jobs will come. Miliband believes that if you get state support just right, as in the story of&#xa0;Goldilocks, then jobs will come. In&#xa0;truth, state support is necessary precisely because our economy \u2013 the number of jobs available, and the range of salaries attached to them \u2013 does not&#xa0;accurately address or match the capabilities and needs of the population. As emerging economies continue to advance, this miserably divisive situation is likely to intensify.</p> <p>What's really happening is that the economies that industrialised first are in&#xa0;the throes of a huge and painful transition, in which they can only maintain their own standard of living by purchasing goods created by people whose standard of living isn't so high. Problem? The customers are here, but the jobs are&#xa0;elsewhere. And of the jobs that are here, many have to compete with the wages that \"elsewhere\" will accept.</p> <p>Looked at this way, welfare can finally be seen for what it is \u2013 a mechanism that nurtures good customers every bit as much as it nurtures good workers. That,&#xa0;quite simply, is the economic and&#xa0;philosophical change that western governments are going to have to learn how to manage. They need to start by accepting the reality of the state that the world, not just this One Nation, is in.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong>Britain faces the possibility of power blackouts and even higher electricity prices within three years as a result of coal-fired and other polluting power stations being phased out more quickly than expected.</p> <p>The warning, in a report by the energy regulator, Ofgem, could embolden the government to trigger an early \"dash for gas\" which critics fear would mean higher carbon pollution for decades to come.</p> <p>Ofgem believes that the spare generating capacity available to cope with peaks and troughs in power demand will fall from the current level of 14% to just 4% as early as 2015.</p> <p>\"There could be insufficient power within three years of around 29,600 megawatt hours, equivalent to the annual demand of approximately 9,000 households,\" says the Ofgem report. It also mentions the possibility of blackouts.</p> <p>Ofgem pointed out that National Grid, which runs the pylons and pipes and co-authored the report, can safeguard the position of householders if all else fails by cutting power to businesses and industrial customers under the terms of special contracts.</p> <p>National Grid also has contingency plans to avoid interrupting supply to customers by asking power stations to maximise generation and importing more power from Europe.</p> <p>However, Andrew Wright, a senior executive at Ofgem, played down the chances of a return to 1970s-style power cuts. \"It is too early to be alarmist about the lights going out,\" he said on Friday, but \"it is likely the tightening of the market will lead to higher wholesale prices\".</p> <p>The cost of fuel is already a major political issue. Britain's second largest energy company, SSE, is planning to increase the price of a typical dual fuel bill by 9% from 15 October and other power companies are expected to follow.</p> <p>Government hopes that it could encourage the building of a new generation of nuclear power stations have been hit by Chinese, German and other major investors pulling back from expected UK investment. At the same time, wind farms have been delayed by planning objections.</p> <p>A report by Ofgem three years ago warned that Britain faced \"unprecedented challenges\" as a result of the global financial crisis, tough environmental targets and the closure of ageing power stations.</p> <p>The regulator admittedon Friday that despite a determination to safeguard the country's power structure by encouraging the building of lower-carbon power sources the \"problems have not gone away\".</p> <p>Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said his forthcoming energy bill and a series of measures on market reforms, about to be published by Ofgem, should help tackle the issue: \"Security of electricity supply is of critical importance to the health of the economy and the smooth functioning of our daily lives. That is why the government is reforming the electricity market to deliver secure, clean and affordable electricity.\"</p> <p>The Greenpeace policy director, Doug Parr, said the Ofgem report \"sends out a clear warning that we need to reduce demand\" rather than build new power stations.</p> <p>The energy outlook has been made more difficult by a 38% fall in coal prices in the past 12 months. This has made coal burning more profitable than ever for power generators, according to the independent energy consultant Inenco.</p> <p>\"However, the accelerated use of coal in the past year does now mean that some older, more pollutant coal power plants will have to come offline earlier than first predicted, leading to a bigger energy crunch further down the road,\" said Gary Hornby, an Inenco analyst.</p> <p>Audrey Gallacher, the director of energy at Consumer Focus, said householders needed protection from price spikes as well as power cuts.</p> <p>\"It is right that we close our oldest and most polluting energy plants, but it is essential that new initiatives deliver investment in alternative energy generation to meet this gap,\" she said, adding: \"At the same time, however, consumers cannot write a blank cheque to cover the costs of new energy.\"</p>",

To salvage his finances, Drumm decided on an unorthodox solution: start a 3D printer company. </p> <p>Like many prospective business owners, Drumm didn't have the capital to get his idea off the ground. So he considered his options. He could put a lien on his house, ask friends for money or sell his cars. After consulting his wife, however, he decided to try Kickstarter, an online funding platform, in order to raise the $25,000 that he needed. </p> <p>To purchase the materials to create the printers, Drumm maxed out his credit cards. Then he set up a <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/printrbot/printrbot-your-first-3d-printer\">Kickstarter</a> page and prayed.</p> <p>\"It was darkest place I've ever been, easily worst time of my life,\" he said. \"Making it out of the debt was all I thought about.\" </p> <p>To Drumm's amazement, just 24 hours after submitting his pitch, the project reached its goal. Thirty days later, the project <a href=\"http://printrbot.com/\">printrbot</a> had been bombarded with $830,827 from 1,808 backers, surpassing his wildest expectations. </p> <p>\"It was totally surreal,\"said Drumm, who is now scrambling to fulfill an avalanche of orders. \"It changed my life.\"</p> <p>What is perhaps most notable about Drumm's story is that, at least in the rapidly expanding consumer 3D printing industry, it is not particularly remarkable. Several 3D printer companies have seen spikes in investment shortly after launching. </p> <p>Just last week a <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/formlabs/form-1-an-affordable-professional-3d-printer\">Kickstarter</a> campaign for the Formlabs' Form 1 printer raised almost as much as the printrbot did in its first day \u2013 and it still has 21 days to go. While several of these fledgling companies have used <a href=\"http://www.webpronews.com/another-cheap-3d-printer-looks-to-kickstarter-for-funding-2012-10\">Kickstarter</a> and other funding websites to help them get on to their feet, others have taken venture capital or simply used their own money to bootstrap their operations into the black. </p> <p>The men \u2013 and they are almost exclusively men \u2013 behind these companies come from all walks of life. Drumm went to school to become a pastor and got into 3D printing as a hobby. The Formlabs project was started by a team of MIT engineering and design students. What such entrepreneurs share is the conviction that this technology is the next big thing \u2013 big enough, some argue, to be this century's most <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/18114327\">disruptive</a> invention. </p> <p>Most consumer 3D printers use a manufacturing process in which layers of plastic resin are laid on top of each other to make objects. While designers, architects and engineers have used 3D printers for decades, to create physical models for their design, hobbyists only started adopting the technology in 2007. Since then, consumer interest has ballooned and entrepreneurs have been scrambling to get a piece of the market.</p> <p>\"You can't keep up with the demand,\" said Drumm. \"Right now there's six of us full-time, including my wife and myself, which is too small, honestly.\"</p> <p>Drumm spoke to the Guardian at the World <a href=\"http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/index.html\">Maker Faire</a> New York, an annual gathering of DIY hobbyists held by <a href=\"http://makezine.com/\">Make</a> magazine that has quickly become an important showcase for printer companies. According to the magazine's maker-in-chief, Sherry Huss, the number of 3D printing companies has increased every year since the first New York Maker Faire in 2010, when there were just three companies. In 2011 five businesses participated and this year about 20 companies, as well as dozens of ancillary businesses selling software, parts and other supplies, were in attendance. </p> <p>\"It's clearly a sign of the times,\" said Huss, who noted that her magazine will publish its first 3D printer buyer's guide in November. </p> <p>A recent <a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb3D_printing_products/3D_printer_services/prweb9719642.htm\">study</a> supports such anecdotal evidence about the industry's expansion. If current estimates are correct, the global 3D printing market will reach $2.99bn by 2018, making it one of the fastest growing industries in the US.</p> <p>Like printrbot, the majority of 3D printer companies at this year's Maker Faire were young \u2013 really young. Eugene Suyu, the 24-year-old founder of <a href=\"http://www.tinkerines.com/\">Tinkerine Studio</a>, only started selling his company's first product, a printer called the Ditto, last weekend. </p> <p>\"With one or two companies the pricing was generally pretty high, but now with so many new people entering the market the prices for these printers are starting to flatline,\" said Suyu, from Vancouver.</p> <p>Erik de Bruijn, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.ultimaker.com/\">Ultimaker</a>, a 3D printer company that started in May 2011, came from the Netherlands. </p> <p>\"It's been a real roller coaster, you know, starting a company,\" he said. \"But we've sold thousands already. It's amazing how many people want this technology.\" </p> <p>While more expensive commercial models retail for a little under $3,000, most companies offer cheaper alternatives. Printrbot's most affordable model costs just $400 and the California-based company <a href=\"http://deezmaker.com/\">Deezmaker</a> retails a stripped-down version of its Bukobot for $599.</p> <p>Most companies sell their products online or at hobbyist events like Makerfaire, but the first two US stores opened last week, which is perhaps an indication of things to come. Diego Porqueras raised $167,410 (after asking for $42,000) in May 2012 on <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deezmaker/buko-3d-printer-raising-the-bar-of-open-source-3d\">Kickstarter</a> and he set up <a href=\"http://deezmaker.com/\">Deezmaker</a> in his Pasadena garage. After being overwhelmed with orders, Porqueras opened the first 3D printer store on the west coast.</p> <p>By far the most successful 3D printing company is <a href=\"http://www.makerbot.com/\">Makerbot Industries</a>. In April 2009 the New York-based company started selling printer kits, 5,200 of which were, as Makerbot's co-founder and CEO Bre Pettis says, \"in the wild\" by August 2011. That success attracted the attention of the venture-capital world, which injected more than $10m into the business, allowing Makerbot to add more than 150 employees (they're still hiring) and open a store in lower Manhattan. In September, Makerbot launched its newest fourth-generation printer, the Replicator 2.<br> \"We started really small,\" said Pettis. \"As the CEO I started packing boxes, because it had to get done.\"</p> <p>Pettis, an impossibly enthusiastic evangelist for the technology, is also perhaps the most visible representative for the consumer 3D printing industry. He can often be found speaking on industry panels, was recently featured on the cover of geek bible <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/design/2012/09/how-makerbots-replicator2-will-launch-era-of-desktop-manufacturing/\">Wired</a> and even appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/388966/june-08-2011/bre-pettis\">Colbert Report</a>.</p> <p>When talking to the entrepreneurs behind these machines, it is difficult not to notice the language they use to describe the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChKwIUhx_ic\">technology</a> behind their blossoming industry. Phrases like \"third industrial revolution\" and \"the reinvention of manufacturing\" are bandied about with confidence. For many, the consumer 3D printing industry is a logical and inevitable step forward. As with the web and the personal computer before it, they expect most households to have some sort of desktop 3D printer in the not-too-distant future. </p> <p>But while they are bullish on the technology's growth, they are more cautious about their own success in the increasingly competitive market.</p> <p>\"I'm not convinced any of us will survive.

  "<p>Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has survived many crises during his seven years in office, both at home and abroad. But fears over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/iran-currency-crisis-tehran-clashes\" title=\"\">country's crumbling economy</a>, which have exposed the extent of internal divisions at the top of the Islamic republic, could signal the beginning of the end.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad has been left increasingly marginalised as the country's currency has plummeted, with analysts speculating that he is being used by his former allies as a scapegoat for the regime's problems.</p> <p>With the rial reaching an all-time low this week, Ahmadinejad has been roundly rebuffed by his opponents, who blame his government for mismanagement and economic incompetence. The currency has lost a third of its value in a week, with the dollar now three times stronger against it than early last year.</p> <p>At a press conference in Tehran this week, Ahmadinejad made a speech which highlighted the power struggle between his supporters and his conservative rivals in the parliament and the judiciary.</p> <p>The president defended his economic policies and blamed the plummeting value of the rial both on western sanctions and a \"propaganda campaign\" perpetrated by his opponents at home.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad's words widened the internal rift, prompting many of his parliamentary rivals \u2013 who form an overwhelming majority \u2013 to launch the strongest attack on him by regime insiders so far.</p> <p>Abbas Rajaei, an MP for the central city of Arak, accused the president of \"lying vividly to the people\", and Kamalodin Pirmoazen, another parliamentarian, said he was inciting discontent among Iranians towards their officials. The influential MP Ali Motahari, an outspoken critic of Ahmadinejad, has also recently said that the president should not remain in presidential office \"even for another single day\".</p> <p>These remarks echoed what the Iranian opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, both currently under house arrest, said in 2009 when Ahmadinejad took office for a second term amid unrest and allegations of fraud.</p> <p>They are the latest signs that Ahmadinejad, who has suffered a series of setbacks in his ongoing feud with the conservatives, has lost a great deal of his influence in the country \u2013 although he is still able to grab headlines abroad. Last week, while he was addressing the UN general assembly, his media adviser, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, was taken to Tehran's Evin prison. Ahmadinejad suggested this week that he wanted to inspect the prison, but authorities signalled that he would not be welcome.</p> <p>It did not help that Tehran's Grand Bazaar, the heartbeat of the capital's economy, also went on strike and hundreds of protesters took to the streets, chanting anti-government slogans that described the president as a traitor\". Iranian state TV, which rarely reflects public anger about the regime, reported the closure of the bazaar and the discontent about the devaluation of currency. Analysts saw it as a sign that pressure is mounting on the president.</p> <p>Sadegh Zibakalam, a professor of political science at Tehran University, said Ahmadinejad was increasingly becoming a \"lame duck\". Zibakalam said Ahmadinejad was being used as a scapegoat by many of the same people who were his supporters in the past.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad's economic policies are not new. They have been in place from the beginning. If there's a failure, it's not limited to Ahmadinejad. The leadership of fundamentalists should be held responsible too.\"</p> <p>Fundamentalists, who are believed to be close to the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have accused Ahmadinejad and his allies, including his controversial chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, of attempting to undermine clerical power and advocating nationalism and greater cultural openness.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad and Mashaei don't think they need to obey clerical power. They both have not been loyal enough to the supreme leader,\" said Zibakalam. He predicted that Ahmadinejad, who cannot run for a third time under Iranian law, would not be able to ensure the election of one of his allies in the 2013 vote.</p> <p>Hamid Dabashi, a professor of Iranian studies at Columbia University, said that some of the slogans used by protesters this week showed that the crisis was \"much more deep-rooted\" and had wider political implications.</p> <p>\"Now the endemic factionalism [in Iran] will try to ride on this crisis, as the Islamic Republic is gearing up for the next presidential election. The conservatives will happily blame Ahmadinejad for everything,\" he said. \"And if [the former president Mohammad] Khatami plays his historic role of warming up the otherwise depleted political energy of the Islamic Republic, they may actually manage to regenerate some political legitimacy for the ruling regime.\"</p>",
  "<p>India's main share index plunged 16% within minutes on Friday in a so-called \"flash crash\" \u2013 the latest in a series of market glitches that have shaken confidence in global financial markets.</p> <p>India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) was forced to halt trading for 15 minutes, after a brokerage placed 59 wrong orders, triggering a sell-off that wiped nearly $60bn off the value of the country's biggest companies.</p> <p>The orders were cancelled and stocks recovered, with India's Nifty index closing down 0.8% on the day. But the event will concentrate the minds of regulators concerned about the impact of trading technology on the stability of markets.</p> <p>This year has seen a series of trading errors that have damaged the credibility of exchanges and rocked investors' faith in financial markets. Last week Nasdaq was forced to cancel trading in Kraft, after a market glitch caused the share price to soar by nearly 30%. That brought back memories of the botched Facebook flotation, when Nasdaq's system crashed under the weight of demand for the stock. Earlier this year, US broker Knight Capital ran up a $440m loss in 45 minutes after a bug in the automation process generated thousands of mistaken orders for stocks.</p> <p>Joseph Saluzzi, co-founder of US agency broker Themis Trading, said: \"We look at it as minor earthquakes and what they build up to is one much bigger earthquake, which could be an entire global market breakdown.\"</p> <p>The NSE blamed Friday's crash on human error but Saluzzi said that was highly unlikely. \"There is no human being in the world that can take down the stock market by 16%. This is typical spin.\"</p> <p>He said any error was probably exacerbated by high-frequency trading, which involves using software to post orders for microseconds at a time to exploit tiny differences in share prices.</p> <p>It is now widely accepted that high-frequency trading fuelled the flash crash of May 2010, which saw the Dow Jones industrial average plunge by 998 points in 20 minutes, raising fears of a worldwide stock market collapse.</p> <p>Concern about high-frequency trading has increased in recent months, with European legislators moving to limit the practice. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/26/eu-group-votes-high-frequency-trades?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">The European Parliament voted last month</a> to force trading venues to slow the speed with which orders can be made. Under the proposed law, share orders would have to be posted for at least a half-second, far longer than high-frequency traders now stay in the market. The German government has also approved a draft bill aimed at reining in the practice.</p>",
  "<p>Fans across the globe are celebrating James Bond's 50 years in film on Friday, as part of Global James Bond Day, but they might reflect that no matter how quintessentially British 007 is, the filmed Bond franchise nearly began with an American in the role.</p> <p>Hollywood idol Cary Grant was urged to take the role by his close friend, the Bond producer Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli \u2013 who had Grant as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx9Jdltjmhg\">best man at his wedding</a>. </p> <p>Grant's English birth and upbringing \u2013 he became a US citizen in 1942 \u2013 might have helped to soften the blow of a \"possible American Bond\", but the deal was kiboshed by Grant, who would only commit to one film. He would also have been 58 \u2013 Roger Moore's age when he played Bond for the final time, in 1985's A View to a Kill \u2013 when it was released.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1ebBKbz0iYI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1ebBKbz0iYI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sean Connery, of course, took Grant's place, but the Scotsman was not the first Bond to air.

  "<p><strong>Tesco</strong> fell to a two month low in a rising market, as investors checked out of the supermarket group's shares in the wake of its first profit fall for twenty years.</p> <p>The company reported half year figures on Wednesday showing trading profits dropped 10.5% to \u00a31.6bn, prompting concerns about its poor UK performance and growing problems in its international business. It closed down 2.8p at 315.35p, its worst level since the start of August as analysts queued up to downgrade the business. Kate Calvert and Freddie George at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> The market was prepared for a decline in profits from Tesco, but we believe its first half results were disappointing even in that context. We have reappraised our forecast and cut 2013 and 2014 [earnings] by 8% and 14% respectively. With no visibility on where UK profitability will bottom and too many of its overseas businesses face trading issues shorter term, we reiterate our reduce recommendation and cut our target price to 290p from 310p. </blockquote> <p>Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> The deteriorating outlook for Tesco's international business, for both structural and cyclical growth, leads us to cut our group pretax profit estimates by 10% for 2013 and 16% for 2014. We believe Tesco is in transition and may well emerge a well-run, mature retailer with operating margins of over 5% and a cashflow yield above 10%. At which point we would see value in the shares up to 380p. But we are not there yet and with several obstacles on the path we cut our fair value by 10% to 300p and keep our neutral rating. </blockquote> <p>Overall the market end the week on a positive note, boosted by better than expected US jobs figures, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finishing 43.24 points higher at 5871.02. Despite continuing concerns about the eurozone crisis - with the problems in Spain, Greece and Portugal far from resolved - the leading index added nearly 130 points over the course of the week.</p> <p>Commodity companies were among the main gainers after the US data suggested brighter prospects for the global economy. <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> led the way, up 18.6p to 333.3p. Analysts at Credit Suisse said:</p> <blockquote> With the strong pick-up in nickel prices (lead indicator for stainless demand), rising stainless prices in Europe and potential supply risk in South Africa (strike risk spreading) we expect the fourth quarter to be a trough for prices and, given very weak recent performance, ENRC shares could see improved momentum near term. </blockquote> <p>Fellow Kazakh miner <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> climbed 31.5p to 738p, while <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 36p to \u00a311.01. <strong>Evraz</strong>, the Russian steelmaker controlled by Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, recovered from a fall on Thursday in the wake of news it was taking a majority stake in coal miner Raspadskaya. Its shares ended 9p to 254.1p. In a hold note, analysts at Societe Generale said:</p> <blockquote> The deal is somewhat unexpected but is the logical conclusion to a prolonged saga of love and resistance as Evraz made unsuccessful takeover attempts before. The valuation looks pricey but we expect limited impact on the share price. </blockquote> <p>But engineering and design firm <strong>WS Atkins</strong> fell nearly 5%, down 34p to 695p after reports its role in the West Coast franchise fiasco was being investigated. The franchise was taken away from the winner, <strong>FirstGroup</strong>, after irregularities in the bidding process. Atkins - along with law firm Eversheds - had reportedly been hired in January to give technical advice on the franchise process. David Brockton at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> Should any review find Atkins to have been at fault during this tender process, then clearly it could have a negative reputational impact for the group, given this represents a high profile tender. <br> </blockquote> <p>Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon added:</p> <blockquote> [The report] is unlikely to be helpful for the share price in the short term. That said, Atkins has strong rail expertise so we expect it to continue to play an active role in a strategically important infrastructure sector over the medium term. <br> Previously it suffered from negative sentiment surrounding its involvement in Metronet [the Tube consortium] but that did not stop it winning future government related work. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile FirstGroup fell 4.5p to 196.1p having lost 20% on the day the franchise was withdrawn.</p> <p>Elsewhere energy services business <strong>Wood Group</strong> added 22.5p to 833.5p after an upbeat trading statement, with the company saying it was confident of meeting full year expectations. The engineering division continues to perform well, with a number of contracts in the Gulf of Mexico, and it confirmed its contract problems in Oman would lead to a $15m-$20m loss from its business there.</p> <p>Keith Morris at Investec kept his hold rating an 800p price target:</p> <blockquote> Today's statement does not highlight any significant changes to the 2012 outlook since the Interims at the end of August. With a rating in line with its large cap peers, we see no specific catalysts for outperformance. </blockquote> <p><strong>Kingfisher</strong> climbed 1.6p to 270.3p despite Morgan Stanley downgrading the DIY chain from overweight to equal-weight. It said the retailer's shares had been weighed down by concerns about its French business, but investors should possibly be more worried about B&amp;Q in the UK:</p> <blockquote> B&amp;Q has delivered just five quarters of positive like for like growth in the last 7.5 years. Gross margin improvements and cost savings have mitigated the top-line weakness thus far, but with first half profits down 24%, we fear that 'self help' may no longer be enough to sustain the chain's recovery. </blockquote> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> added 7.5p to 2918.5p, as traders suggested Monday's decision by new chief executive Pascal Soriot to halt its share buyback programme could mean it was on the takeover trail. US group Forest Laboratories was one name mentioned as a possible target.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, the biggest loser was <strong>Kcom</strong>. The telecoms group fell 5.6p to 78.75p after reporting lower than expected growth in its business and public sector markets.</p> <p><strong>Mitchells &amp; Butlers</strong> rose 5.6p to 306.6p after this week's news that horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier had bought 7m shares in the pubs group through their Elpida vehicle, taking their stake to 22.47%. Joe Lewis, the billionaire currency trader, owns 26.3% and saw two bids for the business rejected last year. Shareholders have been unhappy about the dominance of the major shareholders, with no independent directors on the board.</p> <p>In a buy note Nick Batram at Peel Hunt moved from hold to buy. He said:</p> <blockquote> Few would argue that M&amp;B has not got a high quality estate, but extracting the full potential from its assets has proved frustratingly difficult. This has been further compounded by the boardroom sideshow played out over the past few years. However, we believe that a platform (built on management stability and culture change) is now in place to finally deliver the potential that M&amp;B has long held. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Pursuit Dynamics</strong> lost a quarter of its value, down 2.05p to 6.075p after the company said it was seeking new funding as it awaited firm orders for its process technology equipment. It hopes to provide an update by the end of the month. In March this year the company raised \u00a39.4m with a rights issue, eight months after an \u00a38m placing.

  "<p>Scotland Yard has drafted in immigration officials to each of London's 72 custody suites in a drive to target foreigners arrested in the capital.</p> <p>Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe was believed to be the driving force behind Operation Terminus; a pan-London project under which teams of trained police and UK Border Agency officials have been quietly deployed to every custody suite in London.</p> <p>The force said it was determined to deal more effectively with the 70,000 foreign nationals arrested each year. They comprise, it said, a third of those arrested.</p> <p>A briefing note, circulated on Friday and seen by the Guardian, specifically highlighted the heightened powers of the Border Force to deal with criminals who had committed offences here, were wanted in other countries or had failed \"to comply with the 'being of good behaviour' conditions of their UK residency, by causing harm and risk to others\".</p> <p>\"This operation will not change the MPS [Metropolitan police service] relationship with the general public,\" it said. \"The MPS remains committed to supporting and engaging all London's communities and will continue to uphold the human rights of everyone it comes into contact with, particularly victims and witnesses of crime, irrespective of their immigration status.\"</p> <p>But the pan-London project, which will last six months and follows a well-regarded pilot, has already encountered heavy criticism from refugee and migrant representatives, who fear the Met will in effect behave as an arm of the Border Agency. Politicians also demanded more details about how the Met would keep itself distinct.</p> <p>One group warned the London mayor, Boris Johnson, that as things stood, it may advise clients to avoid any dealings with the police. \"It is already extremely difficult to get individuals to report crimes where they feel vulnerable to harsh treatment as the result of experiences from their country of origin,\" said Rita Chadha of the Refugee and Migrant Forum of east London. \"I would draw your attention to specific incidences where vulnerable victims, especially those affected by domestic violence and other forms of violence may now be even more reluctant to report crime for fear of retribution, from a perpetrator who will be additionally aggrieved for having been bought into contact with the UKBA [UK Border Agency].\"</p> <p>A Met spokeswoman sought to ease concerns: \"The MPS continues to target offenders who have been arrested for criminal offences in the UK and may also be subject to being wanted for offences overseas or here illegally, working with the UK Border Agency,\" she said. \"This is not about us targeting specific communities but about us targeting criminality.</p> <p>\"This is an issue that as we understand it currently, will force us as an advice agency to sometimes advise clients not to report to the police incidences.\"</p> <p>Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London assembly, said it would seek more detail from the mayor and the commissioner. \"Is this about dealing with serious criminal behaviour or just about supporting the UK Border Agency in its work, at a time when the Met itself is stretched? We cannot get to a situation where the police are seen as part of the immigration service and people don't feel able to deal with them in confidence.\"</p> <p>Claude Moraes, the London MEP and former director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \"This is a significant development. It is important that foreign criminals are dealt with effectively. But there may also be serious issues of due process thrown up by this.\"</p> <p>Jenny Jones, a Green party member of the London assembly, called for clear safeguards. \"In the past, the Met's work with immigration officers has lead to poor detection, simply because the urgency to deport people, for example trafficked women, meant that the criminal bosses escaped detection.</p> <p>\"This could make a valuable contribution to tackling organised, serious crime. However, I would have real concerns if we were putting resources into chasing petty thieves because they were 'foreign' when the cuts are threatening our ability to field sufficient officers to deal properly with homegrown cases of rape and other serious crimes.\"</p> <p>The Met briefing made clear its appreciation of the sensitivities. It said lay advisers and figures from \"current and emerging communities\" in London had already been consulted about the way the project would work.</p> <p>\"It is stressed that Operation Terminus targets offenders and not communities. The start point is always the person has been arrested for a criminal offence and is in custody or has significant intelligence or convictions linking them to criminal offending (ie the MPS deals with criminals). This is not about the MPS becoming an immigration agency, it is about the service becoming better able to deal with criminal offenders who, as foreign nationals, we know less about.\"</p> <p>Senior officers and officials in the mayor's office are aware of concerns, widely expressed after last year's riots, that the Met has allowed its relationships with minority communities to wither. But there is also pressure from national government to get a grip on immigration and deport more foreign offenders.</p> <p>The situation is complicated where those offenders are EU nationals. Under a reciprocal arrangement, they can be sent to serve sentences in their home countries but as EU citizens, they can re-enter the UK thereafter.</p>",
  "<p>Cross party consensus emerges only rarely in the tribal world of Westminster. So when politicians do tentatively edge towards agreement, there's always a glimmer of hope that progress might be possible.</p> <p>When MPs return from recess, they will scrutinise the government's plans for the green investment bank (GIB) under the <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/enterpriseandregulatoryreform.html\" title=\"\">enterprise and regulatory reform bill.</a></p> <p>The concept for the world's first GIB was developed by the business and NGO alliance, <a href=\"http://www.transformuk.org/en/\" title=\"\">Transform UK</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/24/budget-green-investment-bank\" title=\"\">introduced by Alistair Darling in his final budget</a>\u2013 before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-green-measures\" title=\"\">being carried through by the coalition</a>.</p> <p>The GIB has huge potential to leverage in a hefty proportion of the private sector investment needed for the UK's low carbon economy to flourish. But, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jan/27/green-investment-bank\" title=\"\">as I highlighted in 2011</a>, there are serious doubts as to whether the GIB will a) be a real bank, and b) be green.</p> <p>The main concern is that the Treasury is ideologically opposed to a fully operational GIB, and given George Osborne's hostility to the idea that there is a green route out of recession, it's clear the battle won't be easily won.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there is growing support for improving the bill. The Liberal Democrats passed a motion at conference calling on the government to \"expand the bank's scale and remit as fast as possible, including relaxing the restriction on its ability to borrow before total public sector debt begins to fall\".</p> <p>And as the bill has winded its way through the Commons, Labour have also shown support for proper borrowing powers.</p> <p>There are now two amendments on the table. First, the GIB must be allowed to borrow from the capital markets the only way to make it a bank rather than a token fund, and to assure investors it's the real deal.</p> <p>The government has said the GIB won't be allowed to borrow until national debt declines as a percentage of GDP\u2013 a constraint which may not be met until 2017.</p> <p>An increasing number of MPs, businesses and campaigners don't see why it shouldn't be allowed to borrow as soon as possible. With the eurozone crisis deepening and the UK economy flailing, the government's timetable is likely to be pushed ever further into the future \u2013any later than 2015, the GIB falls into the hands of a future administration which may never allow it to borrow.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2197469/ngos-warn-green-investment-bank-fails-to-qualify-as-a-bank\" title=\"\">a letter</a> to the prime minister, environmental and business groups pointed out that if the GIB could borrow at a modest ratio of 1:6, this would boost its capital base to \u00a318bn, unlocking \u00a390bn in private sector co-investment. That's almost half of <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/greeninvestmentbank\" title=\"\">the \u00a3200bn we need to invest in the energy sector</a> alone out to 2020.</p> <p>Other countries have managed it already. German state-owned bank, <a href=\"http://www.kfw.de/kfw_/kfw/en/\" title=\"\">KfW Bankengruppe</a>, for example, is one of the world's biggest green lenders and leverages its equity by a factor of 28 times.</p> <p>This highlights the flaws in the Treasury argument that the GIB shouldn't be able to borrow yet because the 'debt' would show up on government balance sheets. The reality is that allowing the bank to borrow immediately would bring in far more private sector money, resulting in greater tax receipts for the Treasury.</p> <p>The second amendment addresses the 'green' question: how will this bank make investment decisions? Who will set the criteria for measuring 'green', and how will those businesses which benefit be held to account?</p> <p>The hope is that the GIB will invest in new green projects: reducing energy consumption and waste, supporting clean energy, or backing \"lean\" technologies. But in its current form, the bill defines the green purposes of the GIB in worryingly broad terms.</p> <p>So this amendment requires the GIB to make sure its investment portfolio increases the UK's ability to meet our carbon targets. Importantly, it proposes an explicit link with the Climate Change Act, requiring the GIB board to consider advice from the committee on climate change.</p> <p>If the coalition gets it right on the GIB, it will have taken one important step towards leaving a decent green legacy\u2013 finally showing that it's starting to understand the value of the low carbon sector in getting our economy back on its feet.</p> <p>Ministers can make this work if they want to. Billions were found to bail out the Royal Bank of Scotland, which the Treasury classifies as 'off balance sheet' because it is a 'temporary liability'. Maybe the GIB could be a 'temporary liability' until it develops credibility and a portfolio?</p> <p>The government might also address the fact that taxpayer-controlled RBS <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/press-release/spending-review-reaction-lessons-should-be-learnt-developing-world\" title=\"\">still invests heavily</a> in oil and gas by, for example, introducing low carbon investment criteria. There's little point in the GIB investing in green technologies if government continues to prop up the fossil fuel industry elsewhere.</p> <p>Ultimately, a Green Investment Bank is a huge step forward but won't be enough on its own to make the low carbon transition. Rather than continuing to debate plan A versus plan B, we need a complete rethink of our economic priorities \u2013 a 'Plan G' to green the UK economy.</p> <p>But in the meantime, if this effort to strengthen the GIB gains cross party support, we still have a fighting chance of creating an institution that can pave the way towards a more sustainable future.</p>",
  "<p>Dedicated to promoting the lifesaving potential of handwashing with soap, Monday 15 October is Global Handwashing Day (GHD). Launched in 2008 during the International Year of Sanitation, GHD saw success across the world, with more than 80 countries and 200 million children involved to date.</p> <p><a href=\"www.watercentre.org/projects/attachments/SustainableHygiene_9.pdf\" title=\"\">Ann Thomas from UNICEF suggests that a sense of global competition</a> has helped to encourage leaders to take GHD seriously with regards to generating publicity and marking the day with ambitious events. In 2009, for example, the President of Mali, the Minister of Health, celebrities and 10,000 children gathered at the Modibo Keita Sports Stadium in Bamako to attempt to break the world record for mass handwashing.</p> <p>Now approaching its fifth anniversary, GHD continues to spread awareness of handwashing as an effective and inexpensive way of improving child survival and health rates across developing countries.</p> <p>A recent report from UNICEF estimated that the annual number of under-five deaths had decreased from 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011. Good news, but not good enough. <a href=\"http://www.washadvocates.org/learn/\" title=\"\">Some 1.8 million people are still dying each year from diarrhoeal diseases and 90% of these victims are children under five</a>. Access to the three basic services of safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, known collectively as <a href=\"http://www.washadvocates.org/\" title=\"\">WASH</a>, are pivotal to preventing these deaths. However in India, more people have access to televisions, refrigerators and mobile phones than basic sanitation. The Indian railway tracks have been described as <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/?hpt=hp_t3#/video/world/2012/09/17/pkg-udas-india-open-toilets.cnn\" title=\"\">\"the largest open toilet in the world\"</a> and Southern Asia is among the regions furthest from achieving the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-child-mortality\">fourth Millennium Development Goal</a>, which aims to reduce the under-five mortality rate by two thirds by 2015.</p> <p>Access to sanitation, the practice of good hygiene, and a safe water supply are estimated to have the potential to save 1.5 million children a year and handwashing alone could be capable of preventing more deaths than any single vaccine or medical intervention. Changing handwashing behaviour is therefore at the crux of achieving the fourth Millennium Development Goal and health initiatives like Global Handwashing Day are invaluable if they go beyond being a great marketing campaign and create real, long term behavioural change.</p> <p>Events like the 2009 mass handwash in Mali are undoubtedly an incredible achievement, but how can this showcase of healthy living behaviour be scaled up from an annual event so that it become the norm? How can a one day focus be translated into a long term vision of political investments, commitments and actions? And what lessons can be learnt from the success of a project like Global Handwashing Day that have relevance for other public health and healthy, sustainable living behaviour change campaigns?</p> <p>In the fourth of our let's talk sustainable living series of discussions, we will explore these, and other, questions. With a focus on developing countries, we will look at how behaviour change initiatives can be scaled up to become mainstream.

  "<p>The two greatest mistakes of modern capitalism have been to confuse materialism with happiness, and growth with the need to produce an ever increasing number of physical goods.</p> <p>These are the core ideas behind the work of artist Tino Sehgal, who is <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-tino-sehgal-2012\" title=\"\">currently exhibiting</a> at the Tate Modern's turbine hall.</p> <p>Sehgal seeks to highlight these fallacies by filling the cathedral-like space with experiences, rather than monumental sculptures or installations.</p> <p>By enshewing traditional forms, he has come to represent the core narrative of the sustainability movement, which is seeking to move beyond consumer fetishism to a more meaningful way of living life, one that respects planetary boundaries.</p> <p>As part of his project for the Tate, Sehgal trained several hundred participants, many of whom have professional jobs, to interact with visitors. Their training was based around questions such as: \"When did you feel a sense of belonging?\" and \"When did you experience a sense of arrival?\"</p> <p>One young woman describes a love affair in Thailand, a teenager about how he conquered a maths problem that boosted his confidence and a retired man, who speaks movingly of how he moved beyond abusive relationships by learning the Buddhist practice of loving speech.</p> <p>Like Sehgal's other works, These Associations, will not be photographed and no documentation or reproduction is allowed. It happens in the moment and leaves no physical trace, but an experience gained.</p> <p>The Anglo-German artist, who rarely gives interviews, agreed to meet me at the Tate's outdoor cafe. By hosting These Associations, he says the Tate Modern has given official legitimacy to the move away from materialism.</p> <p>\"A place like the Tate is like a powerhouse, not in the sense of it having been a power station, but in the sense that politically whatever gets shown here is recognised as official Western culture,\" he says.</p> <p>\"These are places of high, high legitimation in our culture. Even Lady Gaga, although she's possibly the most visible person on the planet, the one thing she doesn't have is this kind of official, almost quasi-stately legitimation.</p> <p>\"A museum is like a valuing machine. Museums and the industrial society started at the same moment and they're really tied into each other. They've been all about displaying objects and the kind of wealth that can be derived from objects and promoting that point. And to come into such a place and say, OK cool, we've done that, and now here's the next step, like maybe what we can derive from objects is not the only mode, and maybe there are other modes which are actually more interesting.\"</p> <p>Sehgal's interest in sustainability has been influenced by his study of political economy, as well as his education in Germany, from teachers deeply influenced by the Nazi era and the 1968 upheavals in Europe.</p> <p>\"We had a lot of teachers who came directly out of '68 and decided to become teachers as a political choice so just in a very straightforward way I was definitely influenced by them,\" he says.</p> <p>\"And also I think this idea, especially of growing up in Germany, that you can fail historically and that has happened before and that can happen again and that a generation can be measured by the way it reacts to a historical problem.\"</p> <p>Sehgal is certainly no enemy of capitalism, pointing out that while there are fundamental problems with the techno-industrial complex, it has also been responsible for major advances in society such as a massive decline in child death rates.</p> <p>He is also a fan of the market-based economy, arguing that it has been responsible for giving people the freedom to express themselves.</p> <p>\"On a very, very basic level I'm definitely pro market because with the market comes the idea of the individual and the idea of specialisation and I personally like being an individual and choosing my interactions,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I don't see culture moving away from that, like back to a farming society. You couldn't do that with the amount of people we have.\"</p> <p>He is fascinated by the conundrum of how the economy can continue to function, while letting go of the need to plunder the earth's resources.</p> <p>Sehgal points to the work of the German economist Hans Binswanger, who calculated that the minimum global growth rate under the current conditions is about 1.8%.</p> <p>He likens the need for economic expansion to a hula hoop: \"It has to have movement, like the hula hoop ring to keep it running; you can't just stop producing.</p> <p>\"One question of [John Kenneth] Galbraith, which really sticks in my mind, is whether persuasion can keep up with production. So basically what he's asking is can we persuade ourselves to buy the stuff that we don't really need, quickly enough. Can the virtuosity of persuasion \u2013 that's marketing \u2013 keep pace with the productive growth, can it be efficient enough in persuading ourselves to produce new desires to keep the specialised economy running while we're getting more efficient at doing the basic stuff, ie the most essential goods like food and housing needed for subsistence.</p> <p>\"As we get better at things, we need less people to produce the things we really need, but what do we do with the rest of the people? They have to be doing something too to buy from those few which are doing the really basic stuff and so that's why we need to be continually producing new stuff.\"</p> <p>Sehgal concurs with the views of <a href=\"http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ces/people/tim_jackson/\" title=\"\">Tim Jackson</a>, author of Prosperity Without Growth, that one answer is to move away from products and invest in areas such as health, education and experiences, such as the arts.</p> <p>Sehgal illustrated this idea with his work Selling Out (2002), in which a dancer mimes a striptease. \"It was a kind of provocative way of saying 'here are products which don't use any material resources but they still generate income and GDP',\" he says.</p> <p>\"That's not so far, I guess, from Tim Jackson, and that's also the point of my work. You can keep the hula hoop thing going with anything.</p> <p>\"There's also this work of mine from 2003 called This is Exchange. You come into a museum and a person comes up to you and offers to pay you half of the entrance fee if you tell him or her your opinion on market economy.</p> <p>\"It's a theatrical proof that even an opinion on the market economy, even a negative one, can be a product. That's the joke I guess. The market economy doesn't care; you can produce GDP by a nuclear bomb or by a negative opinion on the market economy, it doesn't matter, it all keeps the hula hoop thing running.\"</p> <p>Behind Sehgal's work is also the increasing recognition that objects cannot make us happy.</p> <p>He says western society became blinded by the success and status that could be achieved by wealth, but many were now starting to recognise that they have swapped meaningful relationships for money in the bank.</p> <p>\"As a culture or a civilisation we are a bit juvenile, it's like 'Oh, I have all this power, whoa, this is so cool, I can transform the earth and I can produce all this wealth',\" he says \"But we're blinded by our success in a naive way. There's more to life, actually, and I think the sustainability issue is also helpful in reminding us about that.</p> <p>\"There is developing this kind of boredom with this industrialised, materially orientated society; the idea that you can create yourself through attaching objects to yourself, via consumption.</p> <p>\"When I was young it was cars, and today it might be smartphones. I always found that boring. 'I want to transform myself on a deep level.' That seems much more interesting and much more ambitious.\"</p> <p><em>Tino Seghal's These Associations is at the </em><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series-tino-sehgal-2012\" title=\"\"><em>Tate Modern</em></a><em> until 28 October</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>After Wednesday's presidential debate fiasco, the Obama campaign was desperately looking for some good news. And Friday morning, they got some very good news indeed from the labor department's September jobs report. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/oct/05/us-jobs-report-politics-live\">According to this</a>, the economy added 114,000 non-farm private sector jobs, as the unemployment rate fell from 8.1% in August to 7.8% in September. Finally, the Obama administration can say that after 43 straight months of unemployment above 8%, it has now fallen below that psychological threshold.</p> <p>Another good sign was that the labor force participation rate for September edged up, indicating that more people are looking for work. Moreover, the labor department adjusted its August jobs report, adding approximately more 50,000 jobs to its original number.</p> <p>Economically, it was a solid report, but not a blow-out. The economy has slowed markedly since the spring of 2011, when 264,000 jobs were added in April 2011. Friday's number was less than the 139,000 average monthly addition over the first eight months of this year. And it was still far short of the approximately 150,000 jobs per that must be created monthly in order to keep up with the growth rate of the labor force.</p> <p>Yet, consistent improvement in the economy may, indeed, be taking hold: on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) announced that its service index, which measures growth in the services sector, climbed to 55.1% in September, from 53.7% in August. A number over 50% indicates that more service businesses are expanding rather than contracting. This was the best reading in six months, marking the 33rd straight month of expansion and driven by the highest level of new orders since March. Earlier this week also, the ISM manufacturing index, which measures growth in the manufacturing sector, came in at 51.1% for September, the first positive reading in four months.</p> <p>In addition, consumer confidence grew for the sixth straight week, the longest stretch since 2006. Undoubtedly, this has been aided by a jump in the number of mortgage refinances, which jumped 20% last week, to the highest level since 2009. The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell to 3.53 %, a new low.</p> <p>Despite these glad tidings from its survey participants, though, the ISM also announced that their hiring intentions for the future had fallen. And this is the crux of the problem for the economy, as well as for the Obama administration: with the recovery dragging, employers are reluctant to hire; and with poor job prospects, consumers are reluctant to spend. Both factors conspire to keep the recovery painfully slow.</p> <p>So, what is keeping the lid on hiring? The usual suspects: the ever-worsening economic turmoil in Europe has clearly been hurting the US economy since summer of 2011; add to that the uncertainties about the election, and the fiscal cliff, and companies are understandably nervous about taking on new hires.</p> <p>Yet, in the world of soundbite and debate-a-thon economics, September's job report was a great boon for the Obama administration. With unemployment now falling below the headline number of 8%, the Obama campaign can now credibly refute Republican challenger Romney's claim that the economy is not improving. And this may, in the end, be worth a whole lot more than one night's debate performance.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.40am: A study by engineers based at the <a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/research/energy-environment\">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a> has questioned some common assumptions about the environmental credentials of electric cars.</p> <p>Published this week in the Journal of Industrial Ecology, the \"<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/full\">comparative environmental life cycle assessment of conventional and electric vehicles</a>\" begins by stating that \"it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting\". By this, the authors mean that by solving one problem, do electric cars create another? And, if so, does this environmental harm then outweigh any advantages?</p> <p>The study highlights in particular the \"toxicity\" of the electric car's manufacturing process compared to conventional petrol/diesel cars. It concludes that the \"global warming potential\" of the process used to make electric cars is twice that of conventional cars.</p> <p>The study also says - as has been noted many times before - that electric cars do not make sense if the electricity they consume is produced predominately by coal-fired power stations. \"It is counterproductive to promote [electric vehicles] EVs in regions where electricity is produced from oil, coal, and lignite combustion,\" it concludes.</p> <p>So, should this new study make us reassess the environmental credentials of electric cars? Or does the analysis and data help us, as the authors insist, improve the environmental performance of electric cars? As they say:</p> <blockquote> <p>Although EVs are an important technological breakthrough with substantial potential environmental benefits, these cannot be harnessed everywhere and in every condition.</p> </blockquote> <p>Please leave your thoughts below. If you are quoting figures or other studies, please provide a link through to the original source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>10.09am: There has already been some reaction <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillN_BG/status/254133434195251201\">via Twitter</a> asking if the study is \"well-to-wheel\", namely, does it also include the emissions caused during the extraction/production of petrol/diesel?</p> <p>I have just received an email from <a href=\"http://www.ntnu.edu/employees/guillaume.majeau-bettez\">Guillaume Majeau-Bettez</a>, one of the authors, answering this precise point:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, our study covers the whole production chain of the cars and of the fuels, the use phase, and the end of life.</p> </blockquote> <p>P.S. I have asked the authors of the paper to monitor this debate and respond to any other queries from readers.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.32am: It's probably worth highlighting, just in case you missed the link above, that the paper in question can be read in full <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00532.x/full\">here</a>. Here's the key conclusion:</p> <blockquote> <p>The production phase of EVs proved substantially more environmentally intensive. Nonetheless, substantial overall improvements in regard to GWP [global warming potential], TAP [terrestrial acidification potential], and other impacts may be achieved by EVs powered with appropriate energy sources relative to comparable ICEVs [internal combustion engine vehicles]. However, it is counterproductive to promote EVs in regions where electricity is produced from oil, coal, and lignite combustion. The electrification of transportation should be accompanied by a sharpened policy focus with regard to life cycle management, and thus counter potential setbacks in terms of water pollution and toxicity. EVs are poised to link the personal transportation sector together with the electricity, the electronic, and the metal industry sectors in an unprecedented way. Therefore the developments of these sectors must be jointly and consistently addressed in order for EVs to contribute positively to pollution mitigation efforts.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.38am: In the comment below, @MartynW <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18666888\">asked</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>Does this study take account of cars being one of the most recycled products we use?</p> </blockquote> <p>Guillaume Majeau-Bettez, one of the paper's authors, has just emailed me this in response:</p> <blockquote> <p>The crucial importance of recycling is one of the conclusions of our analysis. There are different ways to account for recycling in Life Cycle Assessment. We have chosen to analyse a \"first wave\" of electric vehicles, made from average metal mixes (a fraction virgin and a fraction from recycling). Hopefully, subsequent \"waves\" of electric cars would be made with a higher fraction of recycled metal (ecars made from ecars, cradle-to-cradle...), but the industry is not there yet.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.24am: Many thanks for the great response from readers so far.

For human toxicity, our study partly addresses the difference between emissions to densely populated and less populated areas, though this could certainly be improved. However, we cannot think only of the toxicity on humans; we also address toxic impacts on aquatic life and ecosystems.</p> <p>@Seb: This is one of our core finding: because the production of an electric car causes roughly twice the climate impact of producing a comparable conventional car, it must run on rather clean electricity to \"make up\" for the initial climate impact.<br>Further on @Seb: All use phase energy requirements were based on industry performance tests with the New European Driving Cycle, following the UNECE 101 regulation (UNECE 2005). These tests combine four elementary urban<br>driving cycles and one extra-urban driving cycle, with regenerative charging and energy losses during overnight charging included for EVs.</p> <p>@Guess11: Following industry standard, we based our assessment of the use-phase on the \"New European Driving Cycle\", which includes a typical share of stop-start.</p> <p>As many readers point out, the electric car industry is young and will likely improve in the future.

The automotive industry manufactures \u2013 or is developing \u2013 a broad array of low and ultra-low carbon vehicles, from highly efficient petrol and diesel models, through gas, biofuel and hydrogen, to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, pure-electric and fuel cell vehicles. Every year, the latest drivetrain technologies see emissions reduced, with today's new cars emitting on average 20% less than their 10 year old counterparts. Significant investment is ongoing, with worldwide R&amp;D powering the continuous improvement of existing technologies and the introduction of other low carbon innovations.<br>In terms of the lifecycle emissions of electric vehicles, the energy industry in Europe is constrained by legally binding limits on the total amount of CO2 emitted each year, up to 2020 (EU Emissions Trading Scheme 2009/29/EC). This limit reduces year-on-year to achieve an overall reduction in CO2 emissions. This means, in practice, that if overall energy demand increases as a result of electric vehicles (or for any other reason) then the increase in demand must be met with electricity from renewable or zero carbon generation sources.<br>In addition, measures such as the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which requires 20% of renewable energy by 2020, are positive strategies to achieve CO2 reductions while the European Emissions Trading Scheme requires electricity suppliers to reduce their overall CO2 emissions.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>12.11pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18668194\">Robert Wilson</a>, from the University of Strathclyde's department of mathematics, raises an important point below the line:</p> <blockquote> <p>Simply decarbonizing electricity assuming no increases to demand appears to be a massive challenge. Our choice on transportation appears to be between increased fuel efficiency, a switch to \"cleaner\" fossil fuels and a push for increased public transportation, or aiming for something like 100% electric cars. The first approach is guaranteed some level of success. The second, however will fail completely if the electricity grid is not fully decarbonized. What we really need to do here is reframe this question, and instead ask not whether electric cars are bad for the environment, but how many of them are bad for the environment.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.15pm: Touching on the same themes as this week's paper, <a href=\"http://healthland.time.com/2012/02/14/why-electric-cars-are-more-polluting-than-gas-guzzlers-at-least-in-china/\">Time magazine ran this feature</a> last February on why the use of electric cars in China - where \"about 85% of the country's electricity is powered by fossil fuels, of which 95% is coal\" - is causing an environmental headache:</p> <blockquote> <p>Kilometer per kilometer, electric cars in China beat out conventional vehicles as among the worst environmental polluters. On average, the fine particulate emissions per passenger-km are 3.6 times greater for electric cars than for gasoline cars. That's better than for diesel cars but on par with diesel buses, which can spread their environmental impact across the number of passengers they carry. \"If we compare gasoline car emissions to electric car emissions, the electric cars look very, very bad,\" says Christopher Cherry, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at University of Tennessee. \"So the point is that you have to consider the emissions exposure when the exposure source is far apart \u2014 the electrical power plant as opposed to the tailpipe of a car.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.30pm: As background reading, I have examined the issue of whether \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2011/jan/17/electric-car-emissions\">electric cars really produce fewer emissions</a>\" before.

This applies over a full life cycle, taking account of emissions from power generation and emissions relating to production and disposal.

We need to know the facts about electric cars, their true total impact. Here I will point out something, we still don't know the true impact of the internal combustion cars and the fuel they use. This information is obfuscated by historical habit, for 100 years no one wanted to know. For example, how much electricity from coal burning power plants goes into refining oil? Try and find out how much per gallon? I've asked when filming at a massive oil refinery that had it's own set of pylons coming from a nearby coal burner. No one wants to tell you. (estimates range from between 4 -7 kWh per gallon) We know we need to change the way we generate electricity, with or without electric vehicles this is vitally important. We know what comes out of the tailpipe of an ICE car, toxic and carcinogenic gasses which cause untold levels of harm to human beings. We do know that 100 miles in an electric car uses around 24kWh, in an ICE car around 110 kWh. So from a global energy perspective that's a massive reduction in energy needs.<br>We do know that most EV drivers charge the car at night when the amount of coal burnt to produce electricity is at it's lowest, we know that coal makes up under 30% of the UK grid supply during peak times. We know that most people who drive EV's also install solar panels, I have. In one year, my Nissan Leaf used 5,340 kWh and my solar panels produced 3,555 kWh. We know that an electric car can run on electricity from any source, a fossil burner can only burn fossils.<br>So what about the battery toxicity? Are we just going to throw away the battery after the car has done 150,000 miles? No, of course not. Nissan are about to open a massive battery re-cycling plant at their Sunderland works. What about the massive piles of worn parts the traditional motor industry produces, clutches, waste lubricating oil, the platinum in catalytic converters, filters, pumps, the list goes on and on. Are they thrown away? of course not, they are recycled. What about the materials that go into making traditional cars, sourced and shipped from all over the world. The true well to wheel argument is a minefield, and this report has dived in feet first. Good luck to them.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>1.10pm: Here's another email from Guillaume Majeau-Bettez, one of the paper's authors, this time on the question that I put to him about whether they had also looked at regional variations when it came to the carbon intensity of electricity production. For example, in terms of reducing emissions, is the US grid better or worse than Europe's for charging electric cars?</p> <blockquote> <p>This is outside the original scope of our study. We did not address electric vehicles on a region-per-region basis, but rather on a per-electricity-source basis. This can get quite complex; the electricity mix in any given point can differ from the average (national, regional) mix, and will also fluctuate with time (time of day, season, etc.) Speaking in general terms, however, the average US grid is more fossil fuel and global warming intensive than the European grid.</p> <p>Referring to the latest \"Life Cycle Inventories of Electricity Mixes and Grid\", the US mix causes roughly 800 gCO2-equivalent per kWh of low voltage electricity at grid, compared to roughly 500 for the European mix. (see <a href=\"http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/itten-2012-electricity-mix.pdf\">http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/itten-2012-electricity-mix.pdf</a> - p. 207)</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>2.12pm: <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/marcello.contestabile\">Dr Marcello Contestabile</a>, a research fellow at the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/icept\">Centre for Energy Policy and Technology</a> at Imperial College London who specialises in battery technologies \"in the context of road transport\", has emailed me his thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the last few years there has been a lot of hype around electric vehicles and as a result their environmental credentials have often been somewhat overstated. However, experts are well aware of the fact that well-to-wheel carbon emissions of EVs are strongly dependent on the carbon intensity of the electricity used, and that in extreme cases these could even be higher than those of conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. Lifecycle environmental impacts of electric vehicles are comparatively less well understood and hence studies such as Hawkins et al are needed.<br>In a recent consultancy piece I have conducted with other colleagues at Imperial College (<a href=\"http://www.lcaworks.com/EV%20Lit%20Rev%20FINAL.pdf\">http://www.lcaworks.com/EV%20Lit%20Rev%20FINAL.pdf</a>), we arrive at results that are largely in agreement with Hawkins et al. In particular, we have focused on greenhouse gas emissions and we have reviewed previous studies showing that manufacturing of electric vehicles, and particularly batteries, is likely to be more energy intensive than that of conventional internal combustion engines. However, this can be more than offset over the lifetime of the vehicle if the latter is powered by low carbon electricity and the battery lifetime is comparable to that of an internal combustion engine.<br>In our piece we also argue that the fact that battery technology is still evolving could help mitigating the problem. In fact, for electric vehicles to gain a significant share of the market the cost and weight of batteries need to reduce significantly and their durability increase. Reducing costs involves using cheaper materials, and hence those based on less energy intensive materials would be favoured; reducing weight means using lighter but also less material per unit energy stored, which again could reduce the overall environmental impact of battery manufacturing.<br>In conclusion, it is plausible that the currently higher environmental impact of manufacturing electric vehicles will naturally reduce somewhat if these are adopted on a large scale; at the same time, decarbonising power generation is imperative and it is in this context that electric vehicles should be considered. However, both my analysis and Hawkins et al also suggest that more research on lifecycle impacts of electric vehicles (and indeed any other vehicle technology) is necessary and that road transport policies need to better account for these impacts in order to provide a level playing field where more environmentally benign technologies are adequately rewarded.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>2.24pm: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/electricandy\">Andy Heiron</a>, Renault UK's head of <a href=\"http://www.renault-ze.com/en-gb/z.e.-news/renault-uk-puts-ev-case-forward-in-fuels-of-the-future-debate-81315.html\">electric vehicle programme</a>, has sent me his thoughts:</p> <blockquote> <p>Most of the environmental impact of a car comes in use and in this respect EV's already offer a significant 'well to wheel' advantage, even with the relatively 'dirty' grid mix in the UK. Taking into account the proposed Committee on Climate Change target of 300g/KWh, this would equate to w2w for <a href=\"http://www.renault-ze.com/en-gb/z.e.-range/zoe/renault-zoe-expression-1944.html\">ZOE</a> (210km range, NEDC) of 31.4g/km, and I cannot see ICE technology getting close to that level by 2020.<br>Without access to, or the time to study, this report, it's difficult to add much on the production impacts, but the statement the production of EV's has twice the global warming impact seems high, and perhaps, as one of the authors admitted, reflects the current reality of (low volume) production. Again, I can only comment on the Renault situation where EV's are built in the same factories alongside ICE products and so suggest that a difference of this magnitude seems unlikely.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>2.44pm: <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/about/dr-doug-parr-chief-scientist\">Doug Parr</a>, Greenpeace UK's chief scientist and policy director, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/newsdesk/energy/data/data-do-electric-cars-cause-more-pollution-fossil-fuel-alternatives\">has responded</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Whilst unable to go over the report with a fine toothcomb, the broad conclusions seem right in that:</p> <p>1. <a href=\"http://www.lowcvp.org.uk/news/1644/lowcvp-study-highlights-importance-of-measuring-whole-life-carbon-emissions/\">Ricardo research for LowCVP</a> showed that the climate costs of production of electric vehicles are significant, in particular, in relation to the battery. Policy that ignores this could create perverse incentives.</p> <p>2. Electricity is a carrier of energy, not the primary energy itself. Once fabricated, running electric vehicles off a power system run by lignite will generate increased emissions rather than savings, and generally will off coal too.</p> <p>3. <a href=\"http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/electric_vehicles_research.pdf\">Element Energy</a> have calculated that in 2030, even with EVs representing three-quarters of the total car stock, the additional demands are less than 10% of forecast electricity demand at that time for all end uses.</p> <p>4. It remains an environmental imperative to conserve scarce resources like the minerals and rare earths necessary for battery fabrication. Saving CO2 does not justify laxity on mining standards or waste management.</p> <p>5. The importance of electric vehicles \u2013 and hydrogen-fuelled ones - is that they provide a way of moving away from a hydrocarbon based transport system. Electric vehicle development and mass-production cannot just be switched on and off overnight. So EVs can be supported if there is a broad consensus that decarbonisation of the power system will take place, and a strong implementation plan in a country.</p> <p>6. However, the longer term options of technology change should not obscure the fact that in the short term most of the emissions savings in transport will come from better efficiency of petrol and diesel vehicles. Emissions standards for cars and vans, as are being discussed in Europe and member states this autumn, are the most important measure for reducing emissions over the next decade. Changes in vehicle technology and production that these standards require will generally be helpful in making EVs a more attractive commercial proposition.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>4.37pm: </p> <h2>My verdict</h2> <p>The authors of this new paper are evidently not saying that electric cars are \"bad\" for the environment in all circumstances, but they are confirming what many already knew: that as electric cars become more popular - which is being encouraged by policymakers across many countries - we mustn't lose sight of the fact that the carbon intensity of the electricity used to power them is key. Another crucially important factor to monitor (and, hopefully, ameliorate) is just how energy- and resource-intensive the production of these vehicles can be.</p> <p>The problem for electric cars is that they will only increase their environmental credentials (compared to \"conventional\" cars) once more and more of them are made and used, which, in itself, will drive faster and deeper innovation in battery technology, production efficiencies and end-of-life recyclability. It's somewhat unfair to compare them to conventional cars at present because they are an immature, fledgling technology, but the opportunity for increased efficiency throughout their lifecycle seems significant as/if they become more popular.</p> <p>But a bigger problem, perhaps, is that their environmental \"success\" hangs largely on factors beyond their manufacturers' control. As has been shown in China, electric cars powered by electricity generated through the burning of coal and oil make very little environmental sense. They need to run off a low-carbon, \"smart\" grid where renewables and nuclear do much of the heavy lifting. So policy-makers have a twin challenge if they want to see more people driving electric cars: they need to ensure a low-carbon, smart grid is delivered and they need to assist manufacturers in bringing down the cost of these vehicles. Doing that in a synchronised and timely manner is going to be hard, but a prize worth reaching for.</p>",

  "<p>It is a very political itinerary for a Himalayan trek. Instead of just vistas over serried peaks and the opportunity to be photographed astride a yak, there are former combat zones and valleys that were a \"liberated Maoist\" zone only a decade ago.</p> <p>The new route will take walkers on a three-week trip through the heartland of Nepal's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2006 and pitted government forces against a Maoist insurgency. The region was also home to many of the top Maoist commanders.</p> <p>The scheme is backed by the former prime minister, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, himself a Maoist leader.</p> <p>\"Memorials are built in any country after major revolutions and [the] guerrilla trail is a memorial of the war we have fought,\" Dahal, who goes by the name Prachanda, told reporters.</p> <p>\"We fought the war and this will help us to be a record for ourselves,\" Lokendra Bahadur Bista, a former minister and rebel told the media at a press conference last week.</p> <p>More than 16,000 people were killed during the conflict. The Maoists became the largest party in Nepal after the constituent assembly election in 2008 and have since led the government twice. However, grave political instability remains along with severe economic problems.</p> <p>One aim of the new scheme is to diversify tourism in Nepal. Foreign visitors bring much-needed hard currency into the poor south Asian nation.</p> <p>But major tourist destinations such as the valleys around the massifs of Everest and Annapurna are getting overcrowded and, in some places, dirty.</p> <p>\"The concept of the guerrilla trek emerged as we were looking for new avenues for tourism,\" said Kashi Raj Bhandari, the research, planning and monitoring director at the Nepal tourism board.</p> <p>Surendra Rana, a Nepali researcher, said the trek could benefit marginalised communities from which most of the guerrillas were recruited at the initial stage of war.</p> <p>\"People in the area might have felt isolated from the state and as a result they took part in the civil war,\" Rana said. \"Trekkers and trekking can help them engage with the global community.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 October 2012. Pushpa Kamal Dahal is no longer the prime minister but is currently a Maoist leader. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The first <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/109020652/2012-Reuters-Ipsos-Daily-Election-Tracking-10-04-12\">post-debate poll</a> conducted by Reuters/Ipsos indicates that President Obama is still leading Mitt Romney in voting intention, by 48% to 43% \u2013 but the gap has closed from 48% to 39% pre-debate. I am wary of using a relatively untested online (not phone) poll for analysis, but the survey trends do a good job illustrating why Obama is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">vulnerable, and yet still ahead</a> in this post-debate environment.</p> <p><strong>1). Mitt Romney remains relatively unknown, and Wednesday night probably helped his favorability</strong></p> <p>Americans know President Obama. They either approve of the job he is doing or they don't. They either hold a favorable view of him or they don't. There's not a lot that is going to change that with a month to go till election day.</p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/30/mitt-romney-fault-loses\">discussed last Sunday</a>, Obama's favorability ratings are actually historically low for a person to get elected president. In fact, no president in CBS News/New York Times, Gallup or NBC/Wall Street Journal data has ever been elected with a net favorability as low as his.</p> <p>The issue has been that Mitt Romney's favorability has been even lower. Wednesday night's debate was seen by <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-presidential-debate-2012-ratings-20121004,0,2136083.story\">nearly 70 million people</a>. After a strong performance, the Ipsos data has Romney gaining 10 points in net favorability. A good portion of that is Republicans coming back home. Still, if Romney can be seen as a viable alternative to the president among at least 50% of the electorate, he's at least in the ball game. Wednesday night helped him down that path.</p> <p><strong>2). Barack Obama may have to begin floating on air to win this election</strong></p> <p>Analysts like to say that Obama is defying gravity by winning in such a poor economy. I've pointed out that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/13/mitt-romney-barack-obama-economy\">this belief is poppycock</a>, as the economy is strong enough for an incumbent to get re-elected. Obama was also <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/02/14186700-nbcwsj-poll-obama-maintains-lead-but-romney-within-striking-distance?lite\">leading or tied with</a> Romney on the economy in general, and on pretty much every specific economic issue, including jobs, the middle class and taxes. His lead on other issues and his overall favorability edge combined were going to carry him to victory.</p> <p>The problem for Obama is that his standing on many of these economic issues may have eroded significantly. Mitt Romney gained 9 points on the economy overall, pre- and post-debate, and is up 9 points on taxes, 7 points on jobs and unemployment, and 6 points on the federal deficit (already a strong issue for Romney). If you start applying shifts like this to surveys such as the historically accurate NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, then Romney leads on these issues by 7 to 20 points. Again, Ipsos is only a one-night online survey, but the numbers must be at least somewhat worrying for the president.</p> <p><strong>3). Romney has the potential to continue to gain ground over the weekend</strong></p> <p>It usually takes time for campaign events to fully sink in with the American electorate. Consider the Democrats' highly successful convention. Obama started to gain points immediately, but it wasn't until about week after the the convention that we fully understood the full ramifications of how it shook up the race.</p> <p>Immediate public reaction to the debate isn't as important as how the media <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/02/why-news-coverage-of-the-debate-may-matter-more-than-the-debate/\">portrays the debate in news coverage</a>. It would seem that this coverage is only going to drive more supporters into the Romney camp. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PatrickRuffini/status/253846901403828224\">initial reaction on Twitter</a>, a good source for trends, was 3:2 in favor of Romney winning the debate. That reaction jumped to 4:1 after the debate when the conventional wisdom began to take hold. On Thursday night, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/254027267729145856\">Public Policy Polling found</a> Virginia voters declaring the winner of the debate to be Romney by a 3:1 margin. That's a wider spread than any of insta-post debate national polls.</p> <p><strong>4). Despite all of this movement in Romney's direction, Obama is still at 48%</strong></p> <p>This, folks, is flatout key. Note that Romney gained ground, but <em>Obama didn't lose any</em> in the overall score. The fact is that in an election with strong third-party candidates, the winner is only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/21/50percent-rule-misconception\">going to need about 49% of the vote</a>. Obama is right on the goal line. Romney would have to gain almost all the undecideds to overtake Obama. It's mathematically possible, but also mathematically unfeasible. For it to really work, Romney either has to dislodge current Obama support or change the make-up of the electorate. There's no sign he's done either yet.</p> <p><strong>5). Obama remains personally popular regardless of the issues</strong></p> <p>There are two types of fundamentals: issues-based ones and personality-based ones. President Obama led on both of these heading into the debate. Indeed, the two often coincide with one another, but not always. Al Gore <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100919002302/http://abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/2000vote/general/exitpoll_hub.html\">won on the issues</a> in 2000, but lost on the character traits. Todd Akin wins on the issues (save for his original comments on rape) in Missouri, but most definitely loses on the personality side.</p> <p>Obama's favorability rating was unchanged pre- and post-debate. At least in the Ipsos poll, he still has higher net favorability than Romney. I wouldn't be surprised if that deteriorates, should Romney manages to lead on the key issues of the economy going forward. If, however, the issues and personality fundamentals remain in conflict, there's very little that predicts an election outcome as well as the favorability difference between the two candidates.</p> <p>So, the initial polling does not change my views about debate-effects. Romney seems poised to close a 3- to 4-point gap by picking up latent support, but he is probably still going to trail a week from now.</p>",
  "<p>Brussels has placed itself on a collision course with the Conservative party on the eve of its annual conference by issuing a blunt warning on the dangers of stifling the green agenda.</p> <p>As David Cameron faced pressure from the Tory right to adopt a more confrontational approach to the EU, Europe's environment chief spoke out against critics of environmental regulations for making \"untrue\" claims.</p> <p>Janez Potocnik, the European environment commissioner, told the Guardian that for politicians to suggest that green legislation was a burden was \"very unhelpful, because it is untrue\".</p> <p>\"That rhetoric is missing the point,\" Potocnik said. \"The economy needs the environment, and the environment needs the economy.\"</p> <p>The commissioner, whose comments came after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/danny-alexander-stop-tories-trashing-green-agenda\" title=\"\">Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury chief secretary, accused the Tories of waging a \"constant war of attrition\"</a> on green issues, stopped short of naming any Tory ministers.</p> <p>But George Osborne, who announced a slowing of the pace on climate change targets at the Tory conference last year, has repeatedly attacked green regulations as a burden on businesses and warned they would make the UK less competitive than other countries.</p> <p>Potocnik's intervention came as Cameron prepares to reach out to Eurosceptics by outlining in a major speech later this autumn how he will give voters a say, possibly in a referendum, over Britain's relationship with the EU.</p> <p>The prime minister will say that the consent of the people is needed \u2013 probably in the next parliament \u2013 after a new EU treaty is negotiated to introduce greater fiscal co-ordination in the eurozone.</p> <p>Britain will not be part of any new governance arrangements for the eurozone, but it will have a veto in the treaty negotiations, which means the prime minister would attempt to repatriate powers, possibly social and employment laws.</p> <p>Boris Johnson is likely to pile pressure on the prime minister to move faster to recast Britain's relationship with the EU when he makes two speeches at the Tory conference in Birmingham on Monday and Tuesday. David Davis, the former Tory leadership contender, has called for a \"big renegotiation\" of Britain's relationship with the EU.</p> <p>The former Europe minister told the House Magazine: \"The explicit answer to the European issue, whether it's eurozone or the more general European membership issue, is a big renegotiation and multiple referendums. People say now's not the time to negotiate with the Europeans. There's never a right time to bloody negotiate with the Europeans. There's always an excuse.\"</p> <p>The remarks by high-profile eurosceptics show that any intervention by a senior Brussels figure will be sensitive on the eve of the conference. The environment commissioner told the Guardian he was in favour of streamlining regulations. But Potocnik said he did not want to weaken them. \"I'm not saying you should not simplify as much as possible \u2013 that is worthy of attention,\" he said.</p> <p>The commissioner also warned that measures to remove harmful substances from manufacturing, and to curb pollution, climate change and other environmental damage, could not simply be put off indefinitely. \"Don't kill industry with kindness \u2013 if [dealing with such an issue] is unavoidable, then to try to protect an industry from doing so as long as possible makes it a real problem.\"</p> <p>By providing a clear framework for what is acceptable behaviour and what is not, green regulations not only safeguard the public but also help businesses, he said, because they mean that unscrupulous companies cannot undercut conscientious rivals by polluting or falling short of good standards.</p> <p>Potocnik added that dismissing regulations on problems such as pollution and industrial safety would result in more serious problems and higher costs later on. He said: \"When someone talks about the cost of doing something, you should ask about the cost of not doing it.\"</p> <p>Good regulation could save money and foster innovation and new industries in which Europe could take a lead, according to the commissioner. \"I am a firm believer in markets, which will play a crucial role, but we need to have prices [on pollution], taxes and incentives for removing harmful substances, and so on \u2013 to give a clear signal to industry.\"</p> <p>One of the most contentious green issues between the UK and EU has been the failure to meet air pollution targets. London's air has repeatedly breached levels of particulates and other pollutants that can cause breathing difficulties and contribute to ill health and premature deaths. This leaves the government liable for huge fines that could run into hundreds of millions.</p> <p>If the air at pollution monitoring sites contains particulates above a level of 50 micrograms per cubic metre on more than 35 days of the year, the UK will have breached EU standards. London has had a series of extensions since 2005 to allow the government to meet the standards, so far without success.</p> <p>Potocnik warned that the commission would take a hard line on enforcing the regulations. \"That is what we are there to do. We will absolutely be strict \u2013 that is the rule,\" he said. \"And it is how we will contribute to a better life for people.\"</p> <p>He said improving air quality would reduce the burden on health services, help avoid premature deaths and cut the incidence of respiratory problems.</p>",
  "<p>Despite ecstatic reviews from critics at the New York film festival this week, Life of Pi has been met with a curiously grudging response from the assembled ranks of Oscar-ologists and awards-season prognosticators. </p> <p>\"I think that Life of Pi is going to be regarded as a major visual feast by the visual-delight-for-the-sake-of-visual-delight crowd,\" said Jeffrey Wells, of <a href=\"http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2012/09/pi_oh_my_1.php\">Hollywood Elsewhere</a>, but \"as a non-starter by a significant portion of the family audience \u2026 and as a respectable also-ran in the best picture contest.\" </p> <p>The <a href=\" http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/oscars-life-pi-maybe-feinberg-375151\">Hollywood Reporter</a>'s Scott Feinberg found it \"impeccably crafted\" but, \"while it looks to be a strong below-the-line contender, I'm not sure that I see it contending strongly in the higher-profile categories.\" Fresh from that screening, Indiewire's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/erickohn/status/251740538875809793\">Eric Kohn tweeted</a> \"Pi seems destined for the Hugo slot: F/X-driven, sentimentally involving, respected director.\"<br> Wake up people! Life of Pi is not just a strong contender to make the list of nominees for best picture, but one of the few films that has the potential to go all the way. Here's why: \u2022 <strong>The 3D phenomenon has been dying to crown a king.</strong> Ever since Avatar started the 3D renaissance in 2009, Hollywood has been waiting for someone to enter latest cash cow in a dressage competition. You remember how far Avatar got in the race, only to be felled at the last minute by actors voting bloc, not so much because that they wanted to give acting gongs to The Hurt Locker (they didn't), but because Avatar was perceived to be about cartoon blue people. Last year, too, they showered Hugo with nominations but Scorsese's film, for all its marvel, was a decidedly cold fish to anyone but cinephiles and silent film buffs. \"Too good for kids,\" was one verdict, which pretty much summed up why it failed at the box office.<br> Magical where Hugo was mechanical, Life of Pi comes warmed by Lee's characteristic empathy, tact and sonar-like ability to sound out hidden emotion. The tiger really wants to eat the boy for most of the film: seeing how they broker a peace, without cheating or recourse to anthropomorphism, is the genuine miracle nestled amidst its special effects. \u2022 <strong>It offers Hollywood a flattering image of itself.</strong> A vitally important prerequisite for the best picture winner (and the reason, incidentally, why it will never be a Quentin Tarantino film). For 364 days of the year Hollywood grazes elbows and shins in the mad scramble to put bums on seats, and then, on one day, it puts on a tux and rewards itself for the innovative, artistically daring films it has spent the last year trying not to make. That day is known as the Oscars.<br> Right now, the dominant genre in Hollywood is the \"four-quadrant\" family film with all the technological trimmings. In other words: kids' movies, like this year's Brave, Ice Age: Continental Drift, Madagascar 3, and Dr Seuss the Lorax. Even more than traditional action blockbusters, which play mostly to teenage males, the animated family film is the industry's lifeline right now \u2013 the thing stopping it from sliding into the Pacific ocean. For this, Hollywood is both grateful and guilty. Not many producers, when they started out, saw themselves going in the baby-sitting business. Reared on Godard and the Hollywood New Wave, they still see themselves as iconoclasts, and delight at the prospect of revolution \u2013 as long as it plays. Life of Pi squares that circle. It lends A-list auterist respectability to the main business of Hollywood. It brings redemption to an industry hell-bent on remaking The Smurfs. \u2022 <strong>It offers a bridge between past and future.</strong> The ageing members of the Academy are a backward-looking lot. They love films that evoke Hollywood's past, like The Artist of The King's Speech. At the same time, they are obsessed with tomorrow's tracking numbers and fret endlessly about the future. They see all this technological change going on around them \u2013 digital paint-boxes, motion capture, motion control \u2013 and they want to reward all the effort and artistry, but how can they when what they are looking at, at the end of the day, is a film about blue people, or monkeys taking over San Fransisco.<br> With its Booker-winning literary pedigree and roots in Aesopean fable, Life of Pi offers a reassuring bridge between all this technological whiz-bangery and the kind of classic Hollywood storytelling that gave us The Wizard of Oz or The Jungle Book. A vote for Ang Lee's film is thus more than just a vote for Ang Lee, it is a vote for all those Pixar movies that never quite made best picture, or all those Andy Serkis performances that never found a nomination. This time, all the technology has at its back a Big Theme. \u2022 <strong>It is \"about\" something.</strong> The film celebrates many world religions \u2013 Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, Hindus \u2013 but the casual inclusion of Muslims in that list will play particularly well in Hollywood. Critics will doubtless complain about the slightly saccharine nature of the film's pantheism, and the redundancy of its frame, in which the narrator chews over the spiritual overtones of his tale. But megaphoning your theme \u2013 particularly one as hefty as religious tolerance \u2013 never hurt a film's chances. On the contrary, this is a great example of the kind of misunderstanding between critics and Academy members that leads to shock on Oscar night.<br> \u2022 <strong>Hollywood's growing internationalism.</strong> At no point in its history, save perhaps the silent era, has Hollywood been more international in scope than it is right now, taking over 70% of its profits overseas. That is an industry-changing statistic. And you can see that change at the Academy Awards over the last few years. Think of the 2007's win for Slumdog Millionaire, a British-Indian-American co-production, or The King's Speech, a British film, or last year winner from France, The Artist. \"I'm not American and I'm not French, actually,\" Michel Hazanavicius told the DGA when he accepted his directing award. \"I'm a film-maker.\"<br> Lee has a greater claim as anyone to be at the forefront of this group of global film-makers, which also includes Danny Boyle and James Cameron, who are evolving an international movie grammar for a global audience. Lee's 2000 film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was pretty much the prototype. This not an argument for why anyone will vote for him, merely to point out that he may be on the right side of history. \u2022 <strong>The academy owes him.</strong> After the monumental snub administered to Brokeback Mountain in 2006, when the Academy gave best picture at the last minute to Crash, Lee has been in possession of one of the largest Oscar IOUs since Goodfellas was beaten by Dances with Wolves in 1990. It's worth noting that Lee did gest best director for Brokeback, but Life of Pi is a visual stunner, not the kind of film to split best picture and best director. The IOU pays up in both.<br> \u2022 <strong>The X factor.</strong> When all is said and done, the best picture winner must fulfill on the old promise: show 'em something new. It is here that Life of Pi scores most highly, particularly when placed next to its strongest competitors, all of whom play generically inside the box: Lincoln (historical biopic), Silver Linings Playbook (indie rom-com), Argo (political thriller).</p> <p>Though it contains trace elements of previous pictures \u2013 Slumdog Millionaire, The Jungle Book, Castaway \u2013 Life of Pi feels genuinely sui generis. What is it exactly? A literary adaptation? a children's fable? A 3D movie for all the family? \"I don't get it,\" said one perplexed movie exec told me in the foyer of the New York film festival last week, after the film's debut. \"Who's the audience for this?\"</p> <p>This could, of course, be its downfall. But it's also why I believe that if it wins, it wins big.</p>",
  "<p>Is a belated tightening of measures to stop bovine TB spreading between cattle starting to bear down on the disease in England? That's what the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/2012/10/01/monthly-farming-and-food-brief-september-2012/\">latest government data</a> suggests, making the proposed badger cull even more nonsensical than ever.</p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\">revealed on Thursday</a>, frequent and serious lapses in biosecurity were <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/act_getPDF.cfm?PDF_ID=9444\">discovered by European Commission inspectors</a> in September 2011. These \"shortcomings\" included missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection\" across the industry, all of which increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle.</p> <p>Defra and the NFU pointed out to me that some tightening of the rules and enforcement had taken place following the inspection. So, as Mark Jones from HSI UK, said, why not wait and see how big an impact this has in cutting infections? Furthermore, data from west Wales, which cracked down even sooner, also show falls in TB.</p> <p>Let me be clear: the data so far is provisional over too short a time to be certain that the improved biosecurity is cutting TB in cattle. But you would expect it to and one independent expert told me he anticipated a big impact.</p> <p>Defra says about its <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/2012/10/01/monthly-farming-and-food-brief-september-2012/\">latest disease data</a>: \"There has been a notable decrease in the incidence rate over the past 6 months, mainly as a result of an increased number of tests on unrestricted herds compared to 2011. The provisional June 2012 incidence rate is 4.2 per cent, compared to 6.0 per cent in June 2011.\" That's a 30% fall.</p> <p>But, Defra adds: \"Care needs to be taken not to read too much into short term figures, especially as this figure includes a number of unclassified incidents. As such, the incidence rates are subject to further revisions as more tests and their results for the period are input.\"</p> <p>At very best, the killing of thousands of badgers over at least four years may cut TB in cattle in hotspots by 12-16%, if the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/badger-cull-trial-open-interpretation\">very significant differences</a> between the experimental culls and the actual culls turn out not to be significant after all.</p> <p>So surely a 30% fall in one year is more than enough to warrant postponing the imminent cull.</p> <p>As a footnote, here's a few more revelations from the EC report, which I couldn't squeeze into yesterday's story:</p> <p>\u2022 22% of all new confirmed TB case in cattle are first discovered at slaughterhouses, the anmials having come from \"TB-free\" herds.</p> <p>\u2022 In some cases, milk from diseased cattle was not kept out of the human food chain.</p> <p>\u2022 \"Defra acknowledged there is no practical way to enforce the leaving of [infected] pastures vacant for 60 days on a routine basis.\"</p> <p>\u2022 \"Enforcement of animal disease control policies is fragmented across a number of bodies and weaknesses have been identified, particularly in relation to co-ordination between AHVLA and the local authorities.\" </p> <p>\u2022 \"The delivery of the programme is being undermined at present by resource constraints (particularly in local authorities) ... and inefficiencies caused by the delayed roll out of the new TB software.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the world's most prominent Catholic theologians has called for a revolution from below to unseat the pope and force radical reform at the Vatican.</p> <p>Hans K\u00fcng is appealing to priests and churchgoers to confront the Catholic hierarchy, which he says is corrupt, lacking credibility and apathetic to the real concerns of the church's members.</p> <p>In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, K\u00fcng, who had close contact with the pope when the two worked together as young theologians, described the church as an \"authoritarian system\" with parallels to Germany's Nazi dictatorship.</p> <p>\"The unconditional obedience demanded of bishops who swear their allegiance to the pope when they make their holy oath is almost as extreme as that of the German generals who were forced to swear an oath of allegiance to Hitler,\" he said.</p> <p>The Vatican made a point of crushing any form of clerical dissent, he added. \"The rules for choosing bishops are so rigid that as soon as candidates emerge who, say, stand up for the pill, or for the ordination of women, they are struck off the list.\" The result was a church of \"yes men\", almost all of whom unquestioningly toed the line.</p> <p>\"The only way for reform is from the bottom up,\" said K\u00fcng, 84, who is a priest. \"The priests and others in positions of responsibility need to stop being so subservient, to organise themselves and say that there are certain things that they simply will not put up with anymore.\"</p> <p>K\u00fcng, the author of around 30 books on Catholic theology, Christianity and ethics, which have sold millions worldwide, said that inspiration for global change was to be found in his native Switzerland and in Austria, where hundreds of Catholic priests have formed movements advocating policies that openly defy current Vatican practices. The revolts have been described as unprecedented by Vatican observers, who say they are likely to cause deep schisms in the church.</p> <p>\"I've always said that if one priest in a diocese is roused, that counts for nothing. Five will create a stir. Fifty are pretty much invincible. In Austria the figure is well over 300, possibly up to 400 priests; in Switzerland it's about 150 who have stood up and it will increase.\"</p> <p>He said recent attempts by the archbishop of Vienna, Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn, to try to stamp out the uprising by threatening to punish those involved in the Austrian \"priests' initiative\" had backfired owing to the strength of feeling. \"He soon stopped when he realised that so many ordinary people are supportive of them and he was in danger of turning them all against him,\" K\u00fcng said.</p> <p>The initiatives support such seemingly modest demands as letting divorced and remarried people receive communion, allowing non-ordained people to lead services and allowing women to take on important positions in the hierarchy. However, as they go against conventional Catholic teaching, the demands have been flatly rejected by the Vatican.</p> <p>K\u00fcng, who was stripped of the authority to teach Catholic theology by Pope John Paul II in 1979 for questioning the concept of papal infallibility, is credited with giving the present pope, Joseph Ratzinger as he then was, the first significant step up the hierarchy of Catholic academia when he called him to T\u00fcbingen University, in south-west Germany, as professor of dogmatic theology in 1966.</p> <p>The pair had worked closely for four years in the 1960s as the youngest theological advisers on the second Vatican council \u2013 the most radical overhaul of the Catholic church since the middle ages. But the relationship between the two was never straightforward, with their political differences eventually driving a wedge between them. The dashing and flamboyant Hans K\u00fcng, by various accounts, often stole the limelight from the more earnest and staid Joseph Ratzinger.</p> <p>K\u00fcng refers to the \"heap of legends\" that abound about himself and Ratzinger from their \"T\u00fcbingen days\", not least the apocryphal accounts of how he gave lifts in his \"red sports car\" to the bicycle-riding Ratzinger.</p> <p>\"I often gave him a lift, particularly up the steep hills of T\u00fcbingen, yes, but too much has been made of this,\" he said. \"I didn't drive a sports car, rather an Alfa Romeo Giulia. Ratzinger admitted himself that he had no interest in technology and had no driving licence. But it's often been turned into some kind of pseudo-profound metaphor idealising the 'cyclist' and demonising the 'Alfa Romeo driver'.\"</p> <p>Indeed the \"modest'' and prudent \"bicycle-rider'' image that pope-to-be, now 85, fostered for years has all but evaporated since his 2005 inauguration, according to K\u00fcng.</p> <p>\"He has developed a peculiar pomposity that doesn't fit the man I and others knew, who once walked around in a Basque-style cap and was relatively modest. Now he's frequently to be seen wrapped in golden splendour and swank. By his own volition he wears the crown of a 19th-century pope, and has even had the garments of the Medici pope Leo X remade for him.\"</p> <p>That \"pomposity\", he said, manifested itself most fully in the regular audiences who gather on St Peter's Square in Rome. \"What happens has Potemkin village dimensions,\" he said. \"Fanatical people go there to celebrate the pope, and tell him how wonderful he is, while meanwhile at home their own parishes are in a lamentable state, with a lack of priests, a far higher number than ever before of people who are leaving than are being baptised and now Vatileaks, which indicates just what a poor state the Vatican administration is in,\" he said, referring to the scandal over leaked documents uncovering power struggles within the Vatican which has seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/pope-former-butler-trial-theft\" title=\"\">the pope's former butler appear in court.</a> The trial ends on Saturday.</p> <p>It was in T\u00fcbingen that the paths of the two theologians crossed for several years before diverging sharply following the student riots of 1968. Ratzinger was shocked by the events and escaped to the relative safety of his native Bavaria, where he deepened his involvement in the Catholic hierarchy. K\u00fcng stayed in T\u00fcbingen and increasingly assumed the role of the Catholic church's enfant terrible.</p> <p>\"The student revolts were a primal shock for Ratzinger and after that he became ever more conservative and part of the hierarchy of the church,\" said K\u00fcng.</p> <p>Calling Pope Benedict XVI's reign a \"pontificate of missed opportunities\", in which he had forgone chances to reconcile with the Protestant, Jewish, orthodox and Muslim faiths, as well as failing to help the African fight against Aids by not allowing the use of birth control, K\u00fcng said his \"gravest scandal\" was the way he had \"covered up\" worldwide cases of sexual crimes committed by clerics during his time as the head of the Roman Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith as Cardinal Ratzinger.</p> <p>\"The Vatican is no different from the Kremlin,\" K\u00fcng said. \"Just as Putin as a secret service agent became the head of Russia, so Ratzinger, as head of the Catholic church's secret services, became head of the Vatican. He has never apologised for the fact that many cases of abuse were sealed under the <em>secretum pontificium </em>(papal secrecy), or acknowledged that this is a disaster for the Catholic church.\" K\u00fcng described a process of \"Putinisation\" that has taken place at the Vatican.</p> <p>Yet despite their differences, the two have remained in contact. K\u00fcng visited the pope at his summer retreat, Castel Gandolfo, in 2005, during which the two held an intensive four-hour discussion.</p> <p>\"It felt like we were on an equal footing \u2013 after all, we'd been colleagues for years. We walked through the park and there were times I thought he might turn the corner on certain issues, but it never happened. Since then we've still kept exchanging letters, but we've not met.\"</p> <p>Kung has travelled widely in his life, befriending everyone from Iranian leaders to John F. Kennedy, and Tony Blair with whom he forged close links a decade ago, becoming something of a spiritual guru for the then British prime minister ahead of his decision to convert to Catholicism.</p> <p>\"I was impressed how he tackled the Northern Ireland conflict. But then came the Iraq war and I was extremely troubled by the way in which he collaborated with Bush. I wrote to him calling it a historical failure of the first order. He wrote me a hand-written note in reply, saying he respected my views and thankyou, but that I should know he was acting according to his conscience and was not trying to please the Americans. I was astounded that a British prime minister could make such a catastrophic mistake, and he remains for me a tragic figure.\" He described Blair's conversion to Catholicism as a mistake, insisting he should instead have used his role as a public figure to reconcile differences between the Anglican and Catholic churches in the UK.</p> <p>From his book-filled study, where a portrait of Sir Thomas More, the 16th-century English Catholic martyr, hangs on the wall, K\u00fcng looks out on to his front garden and a two-metre-tall statue of himself. Critics have called it symptomatic of Kung's inflated sense of his own importance. He is embarrassed as he attempts to explain how it was a gift from his 20-year-old Stiftung Weltethos, (Foundation for a Global Ethic), which operates from his house and will continue to do so after his death.</p> <p>Far from putting the brakes on his prolific theological output, K\u00fcng has recently distilled the ideas of Weltethos \u2013 which seeks to create a global code of behaviour, or a globalisation of ethics \u2013 into a capricious musical libretto. Mixing narrative with excerpts from the teachings of Confucianism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam and Christianity, K\u00fcng's writings have been incorporated into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/22/weltethos-review\" title=\"\">a major symphonic work by the British composer Jonathan Harvey</a> that will have its London premiere on Sunday at the Southbank Centre.</p> <p>K\u00fcng says the musical work, like the foundation, is an attempt to emphasise what the religions of the world have in common rather than what divides them.</p> <p>Weltethos was founded in the early 1990s as an attempt to bring the religions of the world together by emphasising what they have in common rather than what divides them. It has drawn up a code of behavioural rules that it hopes one day will be as universally acceptable as the UN.</p> <p>The work's aim is arguably high-minded \u2013 Harvey described the demanding task of writing a score for the text as an \"awe-inspring responsibility\". But K\u00fcng, who has won the support of leading figures including Henry Kissinger, Kofi Annan, Jacques Rogge, Desmond Tutu, Mary Robinson and Shirin Ebadi, insisted its aims were grounded in basic necessity.\"At a time of paradigm change in the world, we need a common set of principles, most obvious among them the Golden Rule, in which Confucius taught to not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself,\" he said.</p> <p><em>Weltethos will be </em><a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/music/classical/tickets/harvey-weltethos-66469\" title=\"\"><em>performed at the Royal Festival Hall</em></a><em> </em>on October 7</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama's hopes of holding on to the White House have received a major boost from new figures showing that the US unemployment rate has dropped below 8% for the first time since he took office in January 2009.</p> <p>The US added 114,000 new jobs in September, in line with expectations. But August's disappointing jobs figure was dramatically revised upwards from 96,000 to 142,000, helping to bring the unemployment rate down to 7.8%.</p> <p>\"Today, I believe that as a nation we are moving forward again,\" Obama told a raucous campaign rally in Fairfax, Virginia, on Friday a few hours after the figures were published. \"This morning, we found out that the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since I took office.\"</p> <p>Acknowledging that the economy was not out of the woods yet, he added: \"Now, every month's figures reminds us that we have still got too many of our friends and neighbours struggling to pay the bills ... But now is certainly not the time to talk down the economy and score a few political points. It's a reminder that this country has come too far too turn back now.\"</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, described the report as \"pretty darn good\". Greenhaus highlighted the fact that the total number of employed persons rose by \"a whopping\" 873,000 while the number of unemployed persons declined by 456,000, the largest increase in employment since January 2003.</p> <p>The news could not have been better timed for Obama, whose re-election campaign has been rattled in recent days by his perceived weak performance in his first debate with rival Mitt Romney. The report contained good news for many voters in key demographics being targeted ahead of the election.</p> <p>The unemployment rates for adult men is now 7.3%, for adult women it was 7%. But problems remain. September's unemployment rate for teenagers was 23.7% and there was little change for black Americans (13.4%) or Hispanics (9.9%).</p> <p>The number of people working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job rose from 8 million in August to 8.6 million in September.</p> <p>\"This is not what a real recovery looks like,\" Romney said in a statement. \"We created fewer jobs in September than in August, and fewer jobs in August than in July, and we've lost over 600,000 manufacturing jobs since president Obama took office.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The results of President Obama's failed policies are staggering \u2013 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six living in poverty and 47 million people dependent on food stamps to feed themselves and their families.</p> <p>The Republican House speaker John Boehner also noted the figures are too high but, unusually, acknowledged there was some good news too. \"While there is positive news in today's report, job creation is far too slow and the unemployment rate is far too high.\"</p> <p>Conservative business guru Jack Welch, former boss of General Electric, went as far as accusing the Bureau of Labor Statistics of cooking the books. \"Unbelievable jobs numbers\u2026 these Chicago guys will do anything..can't debate so change numbers,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack_welch/statuses/254198154260525057\">he said on Twitter</a>. </p> <p>Labor secretary Hilda Solis immediately hit back at claims that the Obama administration might have skewed the jobs numbers. \"I'm insulted when I hear that because we have a very professional civil service,\" Solis told CNBC.</p> <p>The monthly jobs report has become a political hotspot on the 2012 election. Last month's disappointing figures came as the Democrat's wrapped up their convention in Charlotte. \"If last night was the party, this morning is the hangover,\" Romney said in a statement at the time.</p> <p>The final monthly jobs report of the campaign will come just days before the election on 6 November.</p> <p>While Obama can now point to 24 consecutive months of growth, the Republicans argue the rate remains historically weak. An increase of 114,000 barely covers population growth in the US as new entrants come into the job market.</p> <p>Geoff Hoffmann of recruitment firm DHR International said employers were growing increasingly confident but a lot of uncertainty remained.</p> <p>\"There's uncertainty about the impact of healthcare legislation, tax impacts, it's not really clear what is going to happen in 2013 and beyond,\" he said.</p> <p>Hoffmann said recovery was taking place in industries like technology, life sciences and that consumer and retail recruitment were doing \"surprisingly well\". But industries like financial services were still lagging after the financial crisis.</p> <p>Greenhaus said the report was \"95% better than expected\" but warned that slow growth could still come back to bite the recovery in the jobs market. The US recently cut its forecasts for gross domestic product \u2013 the widest measure of economic growth - after a sharp fall in manufacturing orders. \"You can't have jobs growth without economic growth,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>It's heartening to see Friday's news that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/oct/05/us-jobs-report-politics-live\">unemployment rate edged down to 7.8% last month</a>. But let's not get too caught up in celebrations. We need to look beyond the sheer <em>quantity</em> of jobs being created and into the <em>quality</em> of those jobs \u2013 something neither presidential candidate seems very interested in talking about.</p> <p>Buried in the Friday's jobs report is evidence that a disturbing trend continues: the creation of more part-time jobs, many of them low-wage, taking the place of solid middle-class careers. Positions in sectors like manufacturing continued to decline last month, replaced by new jobs in the healthcare, warehousing and retail industries. A lot of these jobs don't allow workers to rack up enough hours to earn healthcare benefits \u2013 let alone break out of poverty.</p> <p>The key data in the new report can be found in a table called \"A-8\". It shows that more workers are in stuck in part-time jobs because their hours were cut back or they're unable to find full-time positions. The number of workers in this category shot up to <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm\">8.5 million in September</a> \u2013 an increase of 581,000 from last month. This month's figure is nearly double what it was in September 2007, the eve of the recession. </p> <p>It's distressing to think that after 20th-century labor struggles won the battle for the <a href=\"http://www.americanrightsatwork.org/component/option,com_issues/Itemid,366/view,issue/id,12/\">40-hour work week</a>, the 21st-century struggle is a fight for enough working hours to make a living wage. That's not what I'd call progress.</p> <p>Here's another sobering number: since September 2007, the number of Americans working full-time has declined by about 5.9 million, while the number working part-time jobs has increased by 2.6 million. (The blog <a href=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2012/05-2/Full%20vs%20Part%20Time%20May_1.jpg\">Zero Hedge drew up this powerful graph</a> in June to illustrate the trend.) During the recovery, job gains have been concentrated in lower-wage occupations, which grew nearly three times as fast as mid-wage and higher-wage occupations, <a href=\"http://www.nelp.org/index.php/content/content_about_us/tracking_the_recovery_after_the_great_recession\">according to a recent study</a> by the National Employment Law Project. </p> <p>The growth of part-time and temporary work is usually a leading indicator \u2013 meaning, a sign that the job market is beginning to heal. But we've reached nearly five years after <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/01/news/economy/recession/index.htm\">the recession officially hit</a>, and it's time to face the fact that these employment trends are more structural than cyclical.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.adjunctnation.com/2012/07/10/part-time-faculty-union-prez-publishes-op-ed-calling-his-own-members-monsters/\">From academia</a> to the retail sector, from government to warehouse work, employers are less and less committal when it comes to their workers. Offering part-time work \u2013 or even full-time jobs <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/workers/misclassification/\">masquerading as freelance gigs</a> \u2013 allows companies to offer stingier benefits packages or none at all. Those in low-wage or minimum-wage jobs often have no retirement security or health insurance. That means relying on Medicaid or even emergency room visits for illness or accidents \u2013 causing stress on workers and shifting costs from employers to taxpayers. </p> <p>Benefits aren't the only problem. Workers desperate to work full time now may also be sentenced to a lower-wage fate in the future. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/business/26work.html?pagewanted=all\">According to a recent study by the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies</a>, women who work in part-time jobs have fewer training opportunities and are less able to advance and increase their pay over time. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ooh/about/projections-overview.htm\">Job growth projections show</a> that we can expect the trend to continue. The healthcare and social assistance sector is expected to add the most jobs by 2020, with retail close behind, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Large segments of both industries are notorious for low-wage and precarious work. Home care workers, for example, lack minimum-wage and overtime protections, while the retail trade has faced hundreds of lawsuits for wage theft. </p> <p>In the retail sector, employers increasingly want an on-call workforce that they can hire when demand is high and ignore when business is slower. Workers at companies like Walmart are reportedly <a href=\"#.UG41uhj-D-Y\">\"fighting for hours\"</a> at their stores, patching together irregular schedules for meager paychecks.</p> <p>Of course, access to fewer hours at one job means hustling for more shifts at another. About 6.9 million Americans were working multiple jobs in September, according to Friday's jobs report. No wonder a large chunk of our <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-57422902-10391704/41-million-american-workers-dont-get-enough-sleep-cdc-says/\">workforce isn't getting enough sleep</a>. </p> <p>Continuing on this path means becoming an ever more precarious, part-time nation when it comes to our working lives. But solutions to the part-time problem aren't easy to come by. Many companies are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/02/us-jobs-corporate-cash-hoarders\">loath to create good jobs</a> in an uncertain economic climate, and it's cheaper and less risky to take people on part-time. </p> <p>The irony is that companies seeking to cut costs are sabotaging their own bottom lines by offering unsteady employment. People working part-time involuntarily have less money to spend on goods and services, and are less able to stimulate the economy. It's a vicious cycle. Short of another economic boom that tightens the labor market, the only hope is organizing for better conditions in the workplace and the political arena. </p> <p>Workers seeking more steady employment could join allies in campaigns for <a href=\"familyvaluesatwork.org\">earned sick days</a> or <a href=\"http://www.domesticworkers.org/\">home care workers' rights</a> to push for new protections. They could propose that part-time workers earn the same hourly pay as their full-time counterparts, and pro-rated benefits, as they do in many developed countries. </p> <p>Winning these kinds of rights would be a heavy lift in a political environment obsessed with job quantity instead of quality. But to avoid a descent into low-wage, part-time nationhood, we need to dream big \u2013 like those agitators pushing to limit the workday many years ago.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The National Employment Law Project, one of whose studies is referenced above, is a client of BerlinRosen, the communications agency for which Moira Herbst works</em></p>",
  "<p>In a valley lashed by wind and rain in the industrial heartland of north-east France, steelworkers blockading the local foundry see their action as a last stand to save their jobs, their factory, their region's economy \u2013 even the entire French steel industry.</p> <p>As thunderstorms raged in the area this week, the symbolism was potent: the picket-line bonfire hissed and went out. The tent where protesters had taken refuge from the elements ditched its concrete anchors and threatened to blow away. \"Let go of nothing,\" someone shouted as men grabbed tent poles. The others laughed.</p> <p>There is little humour to be had these days outside the ArcelorMittal steelworks in Florange, where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/01/arcelormittal-shut-florange-furnaces-france\" title=\"\">\"temporary\" closure of two blast furnaces was declared permanent on Monday, with the loss of 629 jobs</a>. Bitter jokes and anger are directed at the Indian-born, British-based Lakshmi Mittal, owner of the world's largest steelmaking company. \"That man is a predator,\" said Edouard Martin, head of the CFDT union at Florange where he has worked for 32 years. \"He's not an industrialist, he's a financier.\"</p> <p>Martin, whose father worked at Gandrange, a neighbouring steelworks bought by Mittal in 1999 and closed in 2009, added: \"I'm sick of hearing people say: you are a historic industry but one from the past, you have to move on, do something else.</p> <p>\"I say: you don't need cars or washing machines or TGV trains? Try driving a microchip down the motorway.\"</p> <p>The ArcelorMittal plant at Florange has become the symbol of France's industrial decline and a litmus test for the future of steelmaking in Europe.</p> <p>In the Vall\u00e9e de la Fensch in the Moselle, whose rich iron-ore fields once made it the jewel of France's industrial crown, and where \u2013 for this reason \u2013 the earth is soaked with German and French blood spilled in conflicts over the last 140 years, Florange is the last steelworks standing. It's an industrial crisis that has echoes of the privatisations and plant closures that all but wiped out British steelmaking and coalmining in the 1980s and 90s. Unemployment in this area of France is already above the 10% national average, and the Florange plant, which supplies the car industry, has been hit by a fall in demand for new cars. Peugeot Citro\u00ebn caused outrage in July when it announced it was cutting 8,000 jobs and closing a production line in suburban Paris, but it followed a first-half loss of \u20ac700m (\u00a3560m) and a 20% fall in sales in Europe in the first quarter.</p> <p>Mittal is not shutting the entire site, but the so-called \"hot line\", the blast furnaces, where the iron ore is melted to produce steel, and the neighbouring coke plant.</p> <p>Today the two furnaces, closed \"temporarily\" last year, are idle. The nearby heating stoves are on hold, emitting wisps of smoke into the grey sky. \"It's a sad sight,\" says Maurice Nicotra, 47, surveying the abandoned plant. \"It's dead here now. Mittal told us he would put money into our steel industry, but look where we are.\"</p> <p>France's Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who visited Florange during his election campaign this year, and Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for industrial renewal, have taken up arms on behalf of the steelworkers and pledged to find a buyer for Florange's furnaces. However, Mittal, who blames falling global demand for steel and high production costs for the closure, has given them just two months to do so, at a time when Hollande is grappling to reduce the public deficit by \u20ac30m and reverse rising unemployment that has topped three million.</p> <p>\"We're all afraid. Over the years all the plants have closed here. If this one goes it won't be easy to find work,\" said Cyril Colpin, 31, a third-generation steelworker employed at Florange since 1999. \"It's not that we don't make money here, it's that we don't make enough money for Mr Mittal. It's about maximum profit, not people.\"</p> <p>Colleague Ben Khachei, 38, employed at Florange for 15 years, agreed.</p> <p>\"We're attached to steelmaking in this region. We identify with the industry. There are people here whose family have worked in steel for three or four generations. When Mittal took over the plant he promised he'd invest and preserve our jobs. We just want him to keep that promise. What can I say to a man motivated by money? I can only say, behind this steelworks are workers, families, a whole region. I can also say we will always need steel.\" While agreed on the need to save Florange, the plant's main unions, the CFDT and Force Ouvri\u00e8re, disagree over how.</p> <p>Walter Broccoli, the local Force Ouvri\u00e8re secretary general, \"doesn't believe for one minute\" that the Hollande government will find a buyer and wants the plant nationalised. \"We want the government to declare steel a strategic asset for the country like electricity and petrol and requisition it,\" he said. \"Oh, and not give a penny to Mittal.\"</p> <p>He added: \"They call us dinosaurs but the steel industry here has always been at the forefront of new technology. I'm not optimistic. I think we're already condemned, but we have to fight to save Florange because if we don't the whole valley will suffer the consequences.\"</p> <p>Back in the leaking tent, Martin says protesters will maintain the blockade. \"All eyes are on Florange. People are watching our battle to see what happens. They know if we lose, there are no guarantees for anyone. We're a historic industrial area, but for 40 years they've treated us like sheep as they shut our factories. This used to be the jewel of French industry. We had crises but survived them because we were willing to adapt to the market and we produced good quality steel.</p> <p>\"If we lose this battle, it's a bad sign for the rest of Europe's steelworks and will boost the multinationalists who will think they can do anything they want.\"</p> <p>He added: \"People say we are more expensive than Chinese workers. It's true. But those same people forget they're also more expensive.</p> <p>\"Everything and everyone is more expensive in France than in China, so what are we to do \u2013 close down Europe and go elsewhere where everyone is paid $80 a month? It's not about pay, it's about the society we live in. Go tell that to Mittal.\"</p> <p>Henri Blaffard, a vice-president of ArcelorMittal Europe, told the local R\u00e9publicain Lorrain newspaper the closure was due to a \"serious crisis in Europe\" that had led to a 25% reduction in demand for steel.</p> <p>\"We cannot produce when there are no orders,\" he said. \"The overcapacity in Europe is recognised by everyone the markets expect us to adapt.\"</p> <p>He said the steel company had invested \u20ac2bn in other French plants at Dunkirk and Fos \"because they were more competitive\".</p>",

  "<p>That software is everywhere is so commonly accepted that it hardly needs repeating. Take, for example, <a href=\"http://www.getaround.com/\" title=\"\">Getaround</a>. To consumers it's a marketplace where the car-having and car-needing come together to work out short-term rentals mano a mano. But the people at Getaround aren't running a car rental company \u2013 they're running a software company. And a small one, at that. They, along with lots of other small firms and start-ups, are competing against giants in their fields: established, mature, enterprise-type companies that not only have market share, but the capital and cash resources that come with it. We'll call them Goliath.</p> <p>So what's a young David-like up-start to do, armed only with a brilliant idea, raw talent and a willingness to put in long hours? How do they deliver quickly, and on a shoe-string budget? They reach for the slingshot in their back pocket: cloud computing.</p> <p>If there's one lesson you couldn't miss from our recent tech boom and bust cycles, it's that burn rate matters. So it's no surprise to see small new firms embrace the lean philosophy. And we're now at a point where that philosophy can extend to software development tools of all stripes: issues trackers, build servers, code repositories, even integrated development environments (IDEs) are now available as pay-as-you-go services.</p> <p>\"The maturity of open source software development tools alongside the low cost and high availability of cloud-based services have combined to level the playing field and change the technology industry forever,\" said Neil Butler, director and owner of <a href=\"http://www.clearvision-cm.com/\" title=\"\">Clearvision</a>, a leading software change and configuration management consultancy based in the UK. \"Small companies already had bright ideas, focus and innovation but now they're taking on established giants by rapidly producing high quality software solutions that are immediately available to a global audience.\"</p> <p>Instead of spending tens of thousands of pounds on hardware to host your code, you can pay a much smaller amount each month for online repository hosting \u2013 anywhere from $0 to $200, depending on the size of your team. <a href=\"https://github.com/\" title=\"\">GitHub</a> has become the darling of the open source development community for this reason, while businesses are gravitating toward Atlassian's own <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/\" title=\"\">Bitbucket</a> for the free private repositories. The same is true for less technical teams, too \u2013 instead of buying perpetual licenses for collaboration software like a private wiki, you can use an online service that offers the same content and user management capabilities. The savings are realised right away, allowing companies to budget more for staff and product development.</p> <p>\"We've seen our customers reduce their overall cost of development by 10 to 25%, not to mention the fact that they are bringing the product to market faster and generating higher revenue as customers are able to access the service immediately,\" added Neil.</p> <p>Using tools offered up in the cloud also encourages agility. Because hosted development tools shelter their users from the sys-admin burden (installation, upgrades and so on) users can focus on getting their product to market, then responding to customers' needs quickly. And platform-as-a-service providers like Heroku, Amazon Web Services or MS Azure make it possible to spin up environments in a few minutes, for just a few pennies an hour. The feasibility of giving each developer a full environment to deploy and test their changes means more innovation and fewer defects.</p> <p>And speaking of developers, you may have noticed that companies are struggling to fill all their openings (got a friend laid off from a manufacturing gig? Get them into programming classes now!)</p> <p>Cloud-based development tools give you the freedom to look beyond your local area for candidates. No need for them to be near a corporate network; they just log in to the tools online and go. It means managers get to hire the right person for the job.</p> <p>At the extreme end of the spectrum, some companies are even choosing to forego a central office altogether. Cloud-based tools allow them to work together even when they're not in the same room, which makes leasing a room in the first place less important. Another cost-saving coup.</p> <p>There are many providers of hosted development tools and other complimentary cloud-based services that teams of any size can get started with. Our own <a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/software/ondemand/overview\" title=\"\">OnDemand</a> service offers a full suite of development and collaboration tools; <a href=\"http://hosted-projects.com/\" title=\"\">Hosted Projects</a> and <a href=\"http://wush.net/corpsite/landing\" title=\"\">WushNet</a> have similar offerings. <a href=\"https://c9.io/\" title=\"\">Cloud9</a> can round out your collection with a browser-based IDE. Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Linode, and Microsoft's Azure all offer on-demand servers and infrastructure services.</p> <p>The promise of controlled costs, higher product quality and greater staffing flexibility make cloud-based development a compelling option for small firms. The next few years will provide a fascinating spectators' sport as they build rocks to put in their new slingshots, pull back, take aim and... pow!</p> <p><em>Sarah Goff-Dupont is product marketing manager, Bamboo at </em><a href=\"http://www.atlassian.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Atlassian </em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The chief executive of the US investment bank Morgan Stanley has said Wall Street pay is still \"way too high\" and remuneration and jobs will have to be sacrificed to boost shareholder returns.</p> <p>The comments by James Gorman, who took over the running of the bank in 2010, set him apart from longer standing peers who have always defended high pay as necessary for retaining key staff.</p> <p>But Gorman<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0535dc2e-0e3c-11e2-8b92-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28QgJZqXz\" title=\"\"> told the Financial Times</a>: \"Compensation is way too high. As a shareholder I'm sort of sympathetic to the shareholder view that the industry is still overpaid.\"</p> <p>Morgan Stanley is cutting 4,000 jobs, 7% of its workforce, by the end of this year and the bank said it would consider more redundancies next year and pay cuts for the remaining staff.</p> <p>Gorman said that in the past bankers' pay had always increased with revenues, but never came down when revenues came down, as banks were so afraid of losing staff. \"That's a classic Wall Street case of 'heads I win; tails you lose'. The current Wall Street management is a little tougher-minded about that and shareholders are certainly tougher-minded.\"</p> <p>His comments follow announcements from a string of European banks ceding to pressure from shareholders over pay. Deutsche Bank last month said it was cutting bonuses and would spend less of its revenue on pay. UBS said it was considering capping bonuses and linking them to the bank's profitability. The Barclays chief executive, Antony Jenkins, said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/barclays-bonuses-way-we-do-business\" title=\"\">bonuses would be linked to the way staff did business</a>, not just the revenues they generated.</p> <p>These moves are being seen as a gradual shift to a new business model, as banks adapt to a climate of tougher regulation forcing them to reduce leverage, lower trading volumes, growing competition from the likes of hedge funds and private equity firms, and increased public scrutiny.</p> <p>His comments echo those made by Deutsche Bank's co-chief executive Anshu Jain, who recently said the proportion of revenues spent on pay at the bank would have to decrease. \"The payout ratio, it's got to go down,\" he said. \"Employees must make their contribution.\" As part of a major overhaul of strategy, Deutsche also became the first global bank to say it would pay its top 150 managers the deferred part of its bonus only after five years.</p>",
  "<p>Every business is typically affected by an economic downturn and the one we find ourselves in now is no different. In some cases, the arts and culture sector has been hit hardest, which is especially true where public art is concerned, as investment and spend in this area has dried up considerably.</p> <p>But looking inwardly and trying not to just blame the economic market can help to minimise the impact. If you have confidence in your product or service, believe you're a leading player in your market and have the talent within your team to innovate, you can prosper, not just survive.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.jasonbruges.com/\" title=\"\">Jason Bruges Studio</a>, an art installation studio, we were faced with this exact challenge. Cash flow was extremely tight, the business was struggling financially, not enough projects were coming through and the rent was about to double. Two years on we've more than doubled the size of the team, relocated the business, expanded into more territories than ever before, and the turnover has increased by 350%.</p> <p>The business has 10 years of expertise, a reputation most large companies would die for and a niche position in a market that is growing but also light on competition. We set out our strategy, got very tight on financial management and finding new leads, and had the discipline and focus to follow that strategy, which we continue to do today. These are all things that could very well help your organisation.</p> <h2>Where creative and business minds meet</h2> <p>Often, creative businesses are run by creative people. Although sometimes this may work, it typically creates an imbalance between <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/feb/20/can-creativity-save-business-world?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">business and creativity</a>, so finding the right business-focused leader is essential to ensure balanced decisions are made well. Take your pick \u2013 there are plenty of business-minded individuals out there crying out to be involved in a more interesting and creative sector than the one they're currently in. You will, however, need to find someone who has an understanding of how creative businesses work, and who will allow the creative team to focus on the creative process.</p> <p>Financial management and financial decision-making will be fundamental in an arts business' ability to prosper in difficult economic times. Having a freelance bookkeeper come in a couple of days a month is simply not going to work \u2013 having the right financial manager, a financial system covering cash flow, forecasting and debtor/creditor management is essential. At the studio we went from having a bookkeeper one day a week to now having a full time finance manager who helps us make key financial decisions. You may feel you can't afford this, but we've found we can't afford not to.</p> <h2>Making commercial sense</h2> <p>Creative businesses often think about the quality of the opportunity and not always whether the project makes commercial sense \u2013 free pitches, scope creep, charitable favour, friends of friends wanting a quick design or simply tiny budgets are very common. So, more often than not, although we'd love to do the project, economically it's just not viable.</p> <p>Clearly there are times when we see a broad marketing potential in a piece of work or the chance to research or innovate something that's never been done before, and so we agree to carry out design work. But keeping these to a minimum will allow you to focus your time on the projects that count, ensuring they're delivered to the highest possible standard. Remember, good work tends to lead to more good work.</p> <h2>Talent, talent, and talent</h2> <p>Focus on developing the team, bringing in new faces and ensuring you have the dream team the business craves. Our model works on offering design solutions that involve architecture, lighting, interaction, electronics, programming, visualisations and careful project management. But as a small business we only have a limited amount of these resources in house, so every team member has to be at the very top of their game.</p> <p>To attract the best you need the right environment \u2013 one that is supportive of the creative talent, a space that encourages great ideas while also establishing some guidelines and rules that set the tone of the culture of the organisation. We also harvest the best talent from graduating students by offering internship programmes over the summer months. This enables us to try out potential future employees, generating a relationship before our competition.</p> <p>Creating an inclusive culture is also important; all of the good ideas can never come from just one or two individuals. Encouraging everyone to get involved in the creative process, listening to ideas and learning from each other are essential.</p> <h2>Expanding your horizons</h2> <p>If you feel that you have the right product or service that works globally, ensure you identify the key territories and go hard at them. Trying to market your business to the whole world simply won't work unless you have unlimited resources, which is unlikely. We've been extremely successful in identifying North America and China as key markets for our own services.</p> <p>Canada has survived the economic downturn significantly better than most and we currently have three large projects there with more in the pipeline \u2013 this has led to us establishing a new business partnership with an agent in Toronto. In the US we have limited competition so we opened a small studio there and China appears to have a significant demand for creative services. We have just been commissioned to design and build a large project in Beijing, so there is opportunity out there.</p> <h2>Putting yourself out there </h2> <p>Creating a diverse marketing mix to communicate to potential new customers needs to be high on your list of priorities.

  "<p>At this week's Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Ed Miliband, the UK opposition leader, said the time had come to tackle abuses of worker rights. He pledged to \"crack down on employers who don't pay the minimum wage\" and to \"end the shady practices, in the construction industry and elsewhere, of gangmasters\" if he came to power.</p> <p>These are welcome commitments and should be seen as non-partisan issues. Foreign minister William Hague has taken important steps to make the broader business and human rights agenda a <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/human-rights/international-framework/business/\" title=\"\">permanent commitment of the UK Government</a>. Yet these critical issues still don't receive the attention they deserve on the national agenda.</p> <p>It is now over eight years since 23 Chinese workers drowned in Morecambe Bay while picking cockles, prompting many to look again at the underside of employment practices in the UK. The UK <a href=\"http://www.gla.defra.gov.uk\" title=\"\">Gangmasters Licensing Authority</a> (GLA), founded shortly after the Morecambe Bay incident, mobilises a range of political, business, trade union and civil society interests. Together, they seek to protect some of the UK's most vulnerable workers, migrant and non-migrant, in horticulture, agriculture, shellfish gathering and forestry. Any employment agency, labour provider or gangmaster providing workers for these sectors in the UK needs a licence. The GLA, formed under the previous government, has been maintained by the current coalition government. However, there is still no equivalent for the construction sector \u2013 or for other sectors where workers remain highly vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>There are issues, for example, in the hotel and catering sector \u2013 a point picked up by BBC Newsnight last week in two reports revealing the exploitation of agency staff at top London hotels. The <a href=\"http://www.ihrb.org\" title=\"\">Institute for Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB), together with the <a href=\"http://www.antislavery.org/english/\" title=\"\">Anti-Slavery International</a>, has called for greater protection for workers in this sector through the <a href=\"http://www.staff-wanted.org\" title=\"\">Staff Wanted Initiative</a> and for hotels to undertake greater due diligence of all third parties through which they subcontract.</p> <p>Before the London Olympics, the IHRB distributed leaflets to all 1,500 hotels in the Greater London Area providing practical advice for ensuring ethical and legal standards were maintained in the recruitment and employment of staff, including those supplied by agencies. Some action is being undertaken, such as that by the <a href=\"http://www.tourismpartnership.org/\" title=\"\">International Tourism Partnership</a> and some major hotel chains, but the industry needs to take far more responsibility for the business model it operates, which leaves its reputation at risk and its workforce vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police, who are increasingly finding a crossover between labour exploitation and other forms of criminality, have endorsed the Staff Wanted Initiative. It now appears on the Police Knowledge Database used by all police forces in the UK. Early day motion 276 of the 2012/13 session of the UK parliament, which explicitly references the initiative, has so far attracted cross-party support, and there is interest from key government departments in the steps that can be taken to combat trafficking and forced labour.</p> <p>In December 2012, the European Commission will launch its draft guidance to employment and recruitment agencies operating worldwide, and two other business sectors, on how best to implement the <a href=\"http://www.business-humanrights.org/SpecialRepPortal/Home/Protect-Respect-Remedy-Framework/GuidingPrinciples\" title=\"\">United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights</a>. It is important that all those who support the recruitment and employment industry, but also want to see better standards for ensuring that bottom feeders do not exploit workers, engage in this process. For example, they can comment on the draft guidance, the result of a multistakeholder process involving industry actors, civil society, UN agencies and other experts.</p> <p>The UK is not immune to even the worst forms of human rights abuse, such as forced labour and trafficking. But often the greatest risks will lie elsewhere in the world, possibly in the supply chains of many companies or even within a government's own purchasing practices. Last week, President Obama announced a new US executive order strengthening protections in US public procurement in order to fight human trafficking worldwide \u2013 specifically related to cross-border recruitment activities. We must hope that we will soon see similar approaches in the UK: ensuring the way government uses its own purchasing power aligns fully with international human rights standards.</p> <p>These are small steps, but perhaps encouraging signs. We also look forward to the UK government's implementation plan for the UN guiding principles on business and human rights as another sign that government, industry, trade unions and civil society will continue to work closely on ending exploitation and protecting the rights of all those engaged in helping to revive the UK economy. We also look forward to increasing attention to the global supply chains of both UK-based companies and the British government itself.</p> <p>Michael Connarty MP's private members bill \u2013 <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/transparencyinukcompanysupplychainseradicationofslavery.html\" title=\"\">Transparency in Company Supply Chains</a> (Eradication of Slavery) will have its second reading in the house of commons on Friday 19 October, during Anti-Slavery Week. This is a UK version of the California Transparency Act, requiring all companies over a certain size to report on their efforts to ensure a slavery-free supply chain. Significantly, unlike the American act, the British bill will include not just companies producing tangible goods but also those offering services such as hospitality. A commitment from the British government to find time for this legislation would be a welcome sign of their commitment to help root out exploitation and forced labour wherever it occurs. Or, as President Obama called it last week, this \"debasement of our common humanity \u2013 the injustice, the outrage of human trafficking which must be called by its true name modern-day slavery\".</p> <p><em>John Morrison is executive director and Neill Wilkins is programme manager at the </em><a href=\"http://www.ihrb.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Institute for Business and Human Rights</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2>Should new drivers not be allowed on the road after 11pm?</h2> <p>Many young learners, new drivers and parents gave their views after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/04/drivers-spend-year-learners-insurers\">Association of British Insurers called for an overhaul of licensing</a> to reduce 'tragic waste' of young lives on the roads.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18650027    \"><strong>Sydney</strong></a> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I also used green P plates for 6 months after passing my test. I was advised by a police officer to take them out because \"people drive like pricks if they think you're inexperienced\" he said that people with P plates get rear-ended by so called 'experienced' drivers who are too busy tailgating to pay attention to the road<br>Again its very obvious when driving near the test centre where I live that experienced drivers act like pricks around learners. If there's an L plate keep your bloody distance - they are likely to stop suddenly or have uneven acceleration - its not a difficult concept to grasp</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18647995     \"><strong>Lecso</strong></a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I disagree.<br>I live in a country where it's compulsory to do a minimum of 30 hours training, plus theory, plus driving around cones in a car park before being allowed into traffic, plus a first aid examination. Only qualified instructors are allowed to teach you to drive. The standard of driving here is a great deal worse than in the UK, where I passed my test first time (more than 20 years ago) after only six paid lessons, thanks to informal lessons from friends and family.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18648970\"><strong>whimsy24</strong></a> wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm 24 and currently learning to drive. The most dangerous and distracting thing I find on the roads are the impatient drivers (of all ages) who frequently overtake me in dangerous spots, exceed speed limits and cut up cyclists at every opportunity. I doubt this proposal will cure the impatience of a nation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Darjc9</strong> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The P plate is a good idea. I'm 23 and have almost 6 years of driving experience. When I was learning and freshly passed my parents constantly told me the first year of qualified driving was when you truly learned how to drive. I took little notice but as a more matured driver now I completely agree. I think the P plate should be displayed no shorter than 12 months as a means to warn other drivers.<br>Personally, I just think the practical test in this country is shockingly easy. 30-40 minutes in a car isn't long enough to display suitable capability. I was surprised in 2006 when I finished my test as to how little I felt I'd been tested.<br>Make the test longer and much more difficult, as a result people will be forced to learn for longer. It's utterly ludicrous that you can pass a test having not displayed night time driving, rain/wind/ice control or motorway skills.<br>Tests should be limited as well with regard to re-takes. After 3 re-takes you should be forced to wait a year and procure more hours of experience with a qualified teacher. If you can re-take after re-take, inevitably the learner will pass after a fluked 30 minute test yet be scarily incapable on the roads.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>joyofyouth</strong>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are reasonable suggestions from the perspective of actuaries, but ignores some fundamental issues associated with driving. The costs here are phrased in terms of lives saved, but we must also recognize the social cost of delaying and preventing licensing. Currently about 35% (2010 number) of 17-20 year olds have licenses. Of those without licenses only 6% say they don't want one (as opposed to 60% in other age categories). This means the existing framework is placing a significant damper on licenses already due to costs (both the cost of learning to drive and the cost of insurance once license is obtained). Further reducing the incentive to get a license without also addressing some of the cost issues will be detrimental to young people's abilities to contribute to society and to gain valuable experiences.<br>I think we would all agree that two substantial factors contributing to young drivers and accidents are a lack of experience and a relative lack of judgement. Graduated driving schemes are a good idea, especially if they provide drivers with cost incentives (which could be done by the insurers alone if they wanted to). Such schemes should encourage drivers to learn how to drive through on-the-road driving and perhaps take some of the judgement issues out of the driver's hands (though prohibiting night-time driving ignores the fact that the jump in accident rates is really during certain parts of the night such as 2-5 am when young drivers are 17X as likely as mature drivers to have accidents).</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18646474\"><strong>SadieD</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I feel there should definitely be restrictions on new drivers, in relation to speed and carrying passengers. My daughter was killed by a driver who had passed his test a month before. He was racing with two mates, one of whom had passed his test the day before. They were all carrying passengers, egging them on. Two of these passengers were also killed. Need I say more?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18645590\"><strong>0ggers</strong></a> said:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rubbish. I didn't see the phrase 'hazard perception' anywhere. Young drivers don't have much but it can be taught. It can even be done on a simulator - youngsters like that kind of thing, and respond readily to training and doctrine.<br>Limiting their time on the roads will only limit the rate at which they develop these skills for themselves and thereby spread the risk over a longer period.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18645466\"><strong>teentrack</strong></a> added:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Great idea, for most young drivers it's a case of \"how soon after my 17th birthday can I be driving\" not \"am I capable of driving after only a few lessons\"<br>Young drivers need to experience different road conditions, weather and be taught how to anticipate new situations with the guidance of experienced drivers. For example, wet roads, snow, dusk, bright sunshine, built up areas etc . This is best done with the guidance of experienced drivers who can help them through the experience, so that when they are driving on their own they will hopefully know how to react.<br>In Australia, new drivers are only allowed to carry one passenger as statistics show that the more passengers the higher the risk of crashes and fatalities. It should be adopted here. Anything that reduces deaths can only be a good thing. </p> </blockquote> <h2>On the West coast mainline fiasco</h2> <p>Our commenters had much to say about the news of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/04/west-coast-mainline-fiasco-victims\">west coast mainline decision. </a><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18623616 \"><strong>Dromo</strong> says:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this post I'm not taking sides on the question of whether or not the railways should be re-nationalised but as someone who once was in charge of the bidding process for a number of public service contracts (not in the UK) I'd like to ask how many times has the DfT evaluated bids for franchises since the railways were privatised.<br>One could imagine elementary mistakes like the present one being made in the early days but by now they should have a formal procedure in place that covers all the relevant aspects of how to evaluate the bids properly.<br>If the officials in the DfT do not have a set of instructions on how to do this then they are incompetent.<br>If they do have a procedure and it doesn't work after all this time then they are incompetent.<br>If it is a good procedure and they haven't been following it properly then they are incompetent.<br>Judging by the Government's long-standing record of mega disasters in the procurement and execution of major projects (just look at IT, for example) one suspects that this particular mess is not the only one where the evaluation of rail franchises bids has been flawed.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/18624061\"><strong>BloodyTories</strong></a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I've been involved in bidding (on both sides).

  "<p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/170191/human-rights-court-gives-torture-green-light\">European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) refused</a> to accept the appeal of their ruling allowing for the extradition of Babar Ahmad and four others to the United States. This decision, from a court whose very purpose is to ensure human rights are upheld, has been widely condemned by human rights groups and advocates, who are convinced the decision will do just the opposite. The appeal was largely based on the fact that if the men are extradited to the US, they will face years of torturous solitary confinement in America's notorious maximum security prisons.</p> <p>There is another disturbing aspect of the ruling, however, that is less discussed, but equally worrisome: that these men's chances of getting a fair trial will also be compromised by the pre-trial conditions in which they are likely to be held.</p> <p>Because Ahmad and the others fall under the category of terror suspects, there is a strong likelihood that if their extradition proceeds, they will be held in pre-trial detention facilities with <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/usao/eousa/foia_reading_room/usam/title9/24mcrm.htm\">special administrative measures</a> (Sams) in place. Sams were established by the federal government in 1996 to deal with certain gang leaders who had demonstrated substantial risk that their \"communication or contact with persons could result in the death or serious bodily injury to persons.\" Since 9/11, the need for an inmate to have \"demonstrated\" their reach was relaxed, and the department of justice began to use Sams, pre-trial, for terrorism suspects.</p> <p>So what this means for pre-trial defendants is that they are not only held in the kind of extreme isolation that is routine in facilities like ADX Florence \u2013 the federal super-max prison where inmates spend 22 to 23 hours per day in a completely sealed and soundproof cell, and maybe an hour or so in an outdoor cage for solitary exercise \u2013 but they are also subjected to extra measures of isolation. This ensures both that they completely cut off from the outside world and that the outside world is cut off from them.</p> <p>A defendant placed under Sams is usually only allowed to communicate with his immediate family (parents, siblings, spouse and children) and his attorney. Letters to and from his approved family members can take up to six months to be cleared. Such prisoners cannot write to or receive visits from anyone else: friends, extended family or supporters; and they can have absolutely no contact with the media. In addition to the gag that is placed on these defendants, the small number of people with whom they are allowed to have contact are also gagged, as they, too, are bound to abide by the Sams. </p> <p>So, for instance, an attorney who goes to see her client in solitary somewhere like ADX Florence may notice that her client is deteriorating under the conditions of his confinement. But she cannot discuss those conditions with anyone \u2013 not the media, not even the prisoner's family.</p> <p>Sams are thus a pretty effective way of keeping a prisoner out of sight and out of mind, and preventing the public from knowing exactly what is going on inside America's federal prisons. The further consequence of this is a scenario that Franz Kafka himself would have had a hard time dreaming up: these conditions are imposed on defendants who have not yet been tried or convicted of anything \u2013 which rather throws the concept of being innocent until proven guilty out the window. In other words, it makes it next to impossible for a defendant, if they are, in fact, innocent, to actually prove his innocence.</p> <p>By the same token, it makes it impossible for an attorney to mount an effective defense. Gareth Pierce, the lawyer representing Babar Ahmad et al, has described the effect of Sams on any lawyer's ability to do his or her job as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It makes it much harder for lawyers to do a proper investigative job, interview witnesses and so on, if they are not allowed to share the evidence against the defendant and explore it. The other shocking aspect and a compelling reason why prison conditions under Sams seem so relatively unexplored is because lawyers aren't allowed to tell half of this story. Sams are crippling in every way, not just in terms of ability to prepare a trial.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's another, even more chilling reason for lawyers to be concerned about defending clients placed under Sams. Attorneys risk prosecution if they violate any of the terms of the Sams, and precedent has it that the sanction for any violations will be much more severe than the proverbial slap on the wrist. This past June, a ten-year prison sentence <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/nyregion/lynne-stewarts-10-year-prison-sentence-is-upheld.html?_r=0\">was upheld</a> in federal court for Lynne Stewart, a 73-year-old attorney who was convicted in 2005 of \"providing aid to terrorism\" for sharing statements from her client, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, with the media.</p> <p>The prosecution originally sought a 30-year sentence. Stewart, who has been treated for breast cancer, fears she will die in prison.</p> <p>The challenges for defendants under Sams is all too graphically illustrated by <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/My-Student-the-Terrorist/126937/\">the story of Syed Fahad Hashmi</a>, a political science student from Queens, New York, who, while completing his masters degree in London, was arrested for \"providing material support to terrorists\". This material support involved allowing an acquaintance to stay in his apartment for two weeks \u2013 an acquaintance who later delivered raincoats and waterproof socks to al-Qaida. Hashmi was extradited back to America, held in total isolation under Sams for three years at the notorious Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan as he awaited trial. One day before his trial, to the dismay of his many supporters, Hashmi, who was facing 70 years if convicted, agreed to a plea bargain of one count of conspiring to provide material support. He was sentenced to 15 years, which he is now serving, in total isolation, at ADX.</p> <p>You can see why Babar Ahmad and others who are charged with anything to do with alleged terrorism would fight extradition to the US at every avenue available to them.

Picking up on comments by Liam Byrne, the shadow work and pensions secretary, that Labour was likely to be making further welfare cuts if elected in 2015, he writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> I suppose I might have expected a progressive politician of the left to argue something rather different alongside this. To make a vigorous case for the value of social protection, especially now. To argue that Labour should be setting a different agenda \u2013 to stand on the future side of the issue, if you will \u2013 and to challenge the stigmatisation of benefit recipients as feckless scroungers. To acknowledge that a more precarious labour market demands a more comprehensive response from the welfare system. Smarter and more flexible, certainly, but there to catch all those who fall on hard times. And I might expect them to temper their enthusiasm for getting people back in to work with an acknowledgement that there needs to be work for them to get back into, otherwise the risk of punishing the victim is high.<br>It isn't clear that Byrne is doing any of these things. But then I'm not entirely sure he's in the relevant category \u2013 that is, a progressive politician of the left \u2013 so perhaps it would be unfair of me to expect him to.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Should <strong>social work</strong> have fast-track training? A <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/9705/frontline-improving-the-childrens-social-work-profession\" title=\"\">new Institute for Public Policy Research paper</a> suggests a \"Teach First model for children's social workers\", offering a fast-track qualification route into social work. The report's author, Josh MacAlister, writes for Guardian Careers that the report calls for an independent social enterprise providing 12 months of intensive training culminating in accreditation as a social worker, and followed by a minimum of one year as a practising children's social worker. He adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As with the Teach First programme, Frontline participants would be working with children on the 'frontline' from the very start. They would be exposed to the realities and excitement of the job, and develop excellence in their field as well as leadership skills.<br>This plan of action comes at an important time for social work. Recent years have seen a concerted effort to improve the status, training and development of social workers. It is important to point to the work already undertaken by the social work reform board and task force as well as Dr. Eileen Munro. We want to see a programme that attracts and prepares exceptional graduates to be outstanding social workers and I believe this goes with the grain of other reforms.<br>Today's report is a call for change to the profession and the government. It is not inevitable that social work remains one of Britain's least appealing careers when it is in fact one of the most demanding and important. A scheme like this could transform perceptions of social work and contribute to the huge task of tackling social disadvantage.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But on the Not So Big Society blog, social worker and blogger Ermintrude <a href=\"http://notsobigsociety.wordpress.com/2012/10/05/will-fast-track-training-improve-social-work/\" title=\"\">raises concerns about the report and its proposals</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Personally, I can't imagine 'Frontline' would have an equivalent role within social work. I think it is dangerous to separate off the profession and focus on the 'children's social work profession' separately because I think learning and experience (through placements) across the life course is something that marks social work training out. I also think that there is a very facile definition of 'good social work entrants' that doesn't seem to have had regard to any complexity I'd expect from a report.<br>I hope this programme goes nowhere because the experiences of Teaching and Social Work are very different but it's ridiculous and elitist enough for this government to want to run with it.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>\u2022 Nick Walkley, the<strong> Barnet council</strong> chief executive, who is <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=107189\" title=\"\">to move to neighbouring Haringey</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Interesting thoughts on <strong>charities </strong>and \"overhead myths\" raised by Dan Pallotta in a <a href=\"http://philanthropy.com/article/How-Charities-Can-Fight/134634/\" title=\"\">discussion for the Chronicle of Philanthropy</a>.

  "<p>Some shocking figures were released this week in an <a href=\"http://www.iop.org/education/teacher/support/girls_physics/file_58196.pdf\">Institute of Physics (IOP) Report </a> looking at the progression of girls going on to study A level physics. Rather than just concentrating on the percentage of girls taking the subject, which is well known to hover just below 30%, the study analysed the progression of girls from different types of school. </p> <p>Overall 46% of schools did not send a single girl on to A level physics, and if only coeducational schools in the maintained sector were considered the figure was even higher, at 49%. Put another way, nearly half of the mixed, state schools in England did not manage to enthuse their girls sufficiently to make any one of them wish to take physics at A level.</p> <p>It's no secret that many physics teachers do not actually have physics degrees, but if teachers who were lacking confidence and skill in the subject were the only reason for the poor progression, one would expect the figures for boys to be comparable. Not so: only 12% of co-ed maintained schools failed to send any boys on to A level. As the title of the report makes clear, It's Different for Girls. What the report on its own cannot identify is precisely why this might be so, but this is a state of play that should not and must not be allowed to continue for generation after generation.</p> <p>The argument that is so often advanced is that, for whatever reason, girls just don't \"like\" physics. I would contend that the data (also contained in this report) which show that single-sex girls' schools manage to send 2.5 times as many girls on as mixed schools, disproves that argument. However much single-sex schools may have some systematic differences from co-ed ones, I do not believe these differences on their own are sufficiently significant to lead to that enormous difference in numbers. Something in the ethos and environment of many coeducational establishments is coming into play and discouraging many girls from seeing physics as a suitable topic to take at A level.</p> <p>This does not require teachers to be consciously dissuading the girls from thinking about the subject seriously, so much as permitting a culture in which the message is received that somehow it is \"odd\" for girls to be interested in space, machines and machinery, atoms or any of the other exciting topics that lurk in physics. This is a message that may well be reinforced by parents and seems pervasive in the media. </p> <p>Teenagers are very sensitive to subtle cues about what is \"acceptable\", and can take such hints to heart and act upon them. In other words, the fact that there are currently low numbers of women physicists so that they are seen as a rarity if not an oddity, means that the visible stereotype is a male. It is all too easy for teachers (of any subject) and peers to reinforce the stereotype and steer girls into subjects perceived as more normal or acceptable. Hence we continue to see the majority of girls who opt for one or more science A levels flocking to biology rather than physics, whereas the number of boys who do one or other of those subjects is pretty much equal.</p> <p>When I was on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\">the Today programme</a> this week talking about this report, my fellow interviewee was a female head teacher who objected strongly to any notion that a teacher would explicitly tell a girl not to do physics (although I had not suggested this might happen). A little later she went on to produce the argument that maybe girls don't want to do physics. By voicing that assumption she seems to me to be dangerously close to unconsciously reinforcing the stereotype. </p> <p>It is of course not just the teachers who may be giving off negative messages; the boys in a class can play at least as large a role. How often have girls been told by boys that physics is not for them? Or that they'll never get a boyfriend if they are so unfeminine as to like physics? Or, perhaps worst of all, that it isn't cool for a girl to enjoy the subject. I fear many, many women who have stuck with the subject could name frequent occasions when some such similar remark was levelled at them. But how many more girls face this sort of disparagement and give up?</p> <p>Teachers collectively need to make sure, not only that their own actions and words do not discourage, but that they stamp on casual sexist remarks from the boys. Only by such zero tolerance in schools, creating a solid ethos of support for girls to pursue whatever they genuinely are interested in, will we discover what percentage of girls really would like to take physics A level. The IOP report makes it very hard to believe we can accurately assess that figure yet, let alone that we have reached it. </p> <p>Parents can do their bit, both by ensuring from birth they do not project gender stereotypes and also challenging schools about their own statistics. Few parents may know what their daughters are interested in when they look around to choose a secondary school, but it would help to keep the pressure up if they asked questions about each school's record as regards the subjects girls choose to proceed with to A level. The schools inspectorate <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/\">Ofsted</a> may also have a role to play in ensuring that gender equity is considered during inspections. </p> <p>The full list of recommendations that the IOP proposes can be seen in its report.</p> <p>Why does any of this matter? I would suggest there are three reasons. First, it is a matter of natural justice. If the current system is essentially disenfranchising large numbers of girls from considering physics seriously as a suitable subject for them, we are not treating them fairly. </p> <p>Second, as a <a href=\"http://www.raeng.org.uk/news/releases/shownews.htm?NewsID=793\">report</a> from the Royal Academy of Engineering demonstrated this week, we are not producing a sufficient number of Stem (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates to satisfy the needs of employers and the economy. The academy's main focus is on engineering, for which physics A level would be a standard prerequisite. If we are losing, quite unnecessarily, a substantial fraction of each year's cohort from gaining a qualification in physics, there is an easy way of increasing the pool by making sure that all girls get that opportunity. </p> <p>Finally, as with boards of directors, or teams more generally, diversity can be a positive influence on outcome \u2013 be it profit, innovation or some other metric. Let's make sure we do all we can as a nation to foster a diverse pool of talent from which which engineering and physics employers can draw, facilitating real diversity and thereby creativity.</p> <p>As things stand, I \u2013 as that rather odd thing a female professor of physics \u2013 would argue we collectively need to do much more to give all our female children genuine equality of opportunity at school. That includes ensuring that no subject is conveyed as being inappropriate. In that case maybe finally, a female physicist will no longer be regarded as peculiar.</p> <p><em><strong>Athene Donald</strong> is a professor of physics at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of the Institute of Physics</em></p>",
  "<p>Strong economic growth in the past decade among African countries rich in oil and minerals has failed to make a significant dent on their poverty levels, according to a World Bank report.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/10/04/despite-global-slowdown-african-economies-growing-strongly-world-bank-urges-countries-spend-new-oil-gas-mineral-wealth-wisely\" title=\"\">Africa's Pulse, a twice-yearly analysis of Africa's economic prospects</a>, noted that the decline in poverty rates in resource-rich countries has generally lagged behind that of countries without riches in the ground. Some countries, such as Angola, Congo-Brazzaville and Gabon, have witnessed an increase in the percentage of the population living in extreme poverty.</p> <p>The report confirms the common perception that, to a large extent, the benefits of growth have not reached the poorest segments of society. It raises questions for aid donors and African governments on how to deal with the \"resource curse\", with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/26/south-african-goldmines-simmering-resentment\" title=\"\">strikes in South African mines providing a stark illustration of what is at stake</a>.</p> <p>\"Resource-rich African countries have to make the conscious choice to invest in better health, education, and jobs, and less poverty for their people, because it will not happen automatically when countries strike it rich,\" said Shantayanan Devarajan, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa, and lead author of Africa's Pulse. \"Gabon, for example, with a per-capita income of $10,000 (\u00a36,200) has one of the lowest child immunisation rates in Africa.\"</p> <p>How to ensure that natural resources benefit the general population, not just the elite, is a question likely to grow more acute as discoveries of oil, gas and other minerals in African countries are expected to generate considerable wealth in the future.</p> <p>The region's established oil producers represent less than 10% of the share of both global reserves and annual production. Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer, can keep supplying at 2011 levels for another 41 years, while Angola, the second largest producer in the region, has about 21 years remaining at current production levels before its known reserves are depleted.</p> <p>With such sizeable reserves, it is likely the dependence on oil resources in these countries will continue. Production in new mineral countries such as Ghana, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and Uganda could last for a substantial number of years.</p> <p>Others have considerable mineral resources. In 2010, Guinea represented more than 8% of total world bauxite production; Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have a combined share of 6.7% of the total world copper production; and Ghana and Mali together account for 5.8% of total world gold production.</p> <p>Africa's Pulse underlines the continent's heavy dependence on commodities for its recent growth, although domestic demand has played its part. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to grow at 4.8% in 2012, broadly unchanged from 4.9% growth in 2011, and is largely on track despite setbacks in the global economy. Excluding South Africa, the continent's largest economy, growth in sub-Saharan Africa is forecast to rise to 6%.</p> <p>While African economies have not been immune to the crisis in the eurozone, the World Bank said consistently high commodity prices and strong export growth in countries with mineral discoveries in recent years have fuelled economic activity and are expected to underpin economic growth for the rest of the year.</p> <p>A measure of the continent's economic success is strong investor interest. \"An important indicator of how Africa is on the move is that investor interest in the region remains strong, with $31bn in foreign direct investment flows expected this year, despite difficult global conditions,\" said Makhtar Diop, World Bank vice-president for Africa.</p> <p>The report noted that, after 10 years of high growth, an increasing number of countries are moving into \"middle-income\" status, defined as those countries reaching more than $1,000 per-capita income. Of 48 countries, 22 with a combined population of 400 million have officially achieved middle-income status.</p> <p>But there are risks, with a fragile global economic recovery posing the greatest threat. A \"hard landing\" for the Chinese economy would adversely affect growth prospects. Over the past decade, sub-Saharan exports to China have risen from 5% to around 19.3% in 2010, with producers of oil (Sudan, Congo) and metal and mineral exporters (Zambia, Mauritania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo) among countries heavily dependent on Chinese appetite for commodities.</p> <p>The report noted that oil-rich countries systematically perform worse than any other country groups in terms of voice and accountability, political stability, rule of law and the control of corruption. Chad and Sudan are the worst performers, according to the World Bank, and their governance indicators improved little between 2000-2010.</p> <p>Anti-poverty campaigners have been pressing for more transparency and accountability in the natural resource sector as a way of putting pressure on governments. A focus of such efforts is the <a href=\"http://eiti.org/\" title=\"\">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative</a>, which provides an internationally-recognised framework for public disclosure by mining companies and governments of what they pay and earn respectively. However, the initiative is voluntary, leaving implementation to those who sign up.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/19/eu-tougher-transparency-law-extractive\" title=\"\">A European parliamentary committee last month approved a measure requiring EU oil, gas, mining and timber companies to publish their payments to foreign governments</a>. The vote puts the world on track to create strong global transparency standards with equivalent rules in the EU and the US.</p>",
  "<p>High Street banks need to step aside and allow community development finance institutions (CDFIs) to offer small-scale capital loans for SMEs and social enterprises, Lib Dem peer Baroness Kramer told the <a href=\"http://www.cdfa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Development Finance Association </a>(CDFA) conference in Solihull yesterday. \"I have long taken the view frankly that for the high street banks, small businesses in vulnerable communities are just never going to be their client base\", said Baroness Kramer. \"I only just wish that they would say it\".</p> <p>During a session billed as 'How can banks and CDFIs work together...?', rather than working together Baroness Kramer appeared to suggest that each should know their separate role and get on with it. \"The reality is that... [high street banks] certainly can't do relationship management for a micro business. One of the banks was very honest and direct with me and said 'any loan under \u00a3150,000 is going to be done by an algorithm, that's just the way it is \u2013 anything smaller than that, we are just not the appropriate institution to do customised relationship banking'. Well I wish they would say it to Treasury and to government, and that would enable them to get out of the way... To make sure [the CDFI] sector can move in and thrive and as a consequence the communities that you serve thrive.\"</p> <p>In response, Irene Graham, managing director of business finance and strategy initiatives at the British Bankers Association, quoted the SME finance monitor that has found for the last four quarters that 7 out of 10 businesses have the right finance and are happy with the finance they have. Of those seeking finance through overdraft approvals, 90% are approved, said Graham. \"For those businesses that aren't getting the finance that they need, there are some characteristics that are coming to the fore.</p> <p>The characteristics are they are early-stage, start-up businesses, they don't necessarily have finance expertise in the company. Only 6% of businesses seek professional advice.\"</p> <p>Similarly said Peter Ibbetson, chair of small business banking at RBS, the major high street banks \"are lending about \u00a3100m to businesses every day and approving about nine out of ten applications for credit.\"</p> <p>This rosy picture was not shared by many other conference speakers or delegates from the CDFI sector. Peter Holbrook, chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise UK</a>, said at a plenary session, \"Are social enterprises financially excluded? The short answer is 'yes'... 44% say that their greatest barrier to growth and sustainability is access to capital. So we do clearly have a problem.\"</p> <p>The bank-to-CDFI referral scheme to be jointly piloted by the CDFA and the <a href=\"http://www.bba.org.uk/\" title=\"\">British Bankers Association</a>, however, was widely welcomed. Baroness Kramer described it as \"a huge step forward\". Jonathan Diggines, chair of the CDFA, told delegates there has been \"a lot of talk about whether the banks are lending or not and if so how much.... [the referral scheme] is our chance to find out.\" He informed that the scheme is expected to work within the loan space of \u00a350,000-70,000 whereby a rejected loan applicant will be automatically referred by the banks to the CDFA who will match them with potential CDFI funding.</p> <p>From the big banks' perspective, Irene Graham suggested that if Baroness Kramer's wish is granted and banks to step out of small scale business finance, then they would happily step back in again once the business achieves scale. This could then offer the best of both worlds and an outline for what an effective partnership between banks and CDFIs could actually look like. \"The national referral system ensures that the customer that isn't right for banking finance is given the automatic choice to be passed on to a CDFI\", said Graham. \"We hope that that creates a virtuous circle... and that business or social enterprise then ultimately comes back to the banking environment.\"</p> <p><em>Tim Smedley is a freelance features writer for national newspapers and magazines, specialising in work, sustainability and social issues</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Congestion with cars pulling up to drop children off and pick them up again is a daily problem for schools, not only causing issues for local residents but also contributing to global pollution.</p> <p>And it is not only the health of the planet that is suffering. Air pollution, according to a <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk/publications/category/item/something-in-the-air-the-forgotten-crisis-of-britain-s-poor-air-quality\">report from the Policy Exchange</a>, is second only to smoking as a public health risk.</p> <p>This month sees the start of International <a href=\"http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/walk-with-us/walk-to-school/walk-to-school-month\">Walk to School month</a>, an initiative aimed at encouraging children to use their legs and get walking. Not just for the health benefits but also as a way to make pupils and parents more aware of the environmental benefits of walking to school.</p> <p>School congestion has long been an issue for Mike Green, head teacher at <a href=\"http://www.sunnybankprimary.org.uk/index.htm\">Sunny Bank Primary School</a> in Bury, Lancashire. But back in 2005 the school was one of the first in the area to have its travel plan approved by the local authority. Sunny Bank's travel plan was primarily designed to address issues surrounding congestion at peak times plus a lack of diversity in how children and parents travelled to school. It resulted in securing parking restrictions around the school and funding for a bike and scooter park on the site. The school has taken part in a number of WOW initiatives (Walk every Wednesday or Walk once a Week) supported by charity <a href=\"http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/\">Living Streets</a>.</p> <p>Green said: \"Since taking part in the WOW scheme, our school walking bus has been formed. The bus is driven by a stalwart group of parents and grandparents who pick up passengers at designated points on route. The route has been risk assessed by the local authority and the council agreed to the bus stops being marked out on the pavements. This led to our participation in the national <a href=\"http://www.brake.org.uk/walkingbus\">Giant Walking Bus organised by the charity Brake</a>.\".</p> <p>One of the main benefits for the school has been spin-offs into other environmental activities such as the <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/what-we-do/bike-it\">Bike-It scheme run by Sustrans</a>, which encourages children to cycle or scoot to school.</p> <p>Green said: \"Our Bike-It officer runs all sorts of events, including balance bike sessions or throw away your stabilizers day for the youngest children plus bike maintenance classes, supervised bike rides and things such as <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/resources/in-the-news/the-big-pedal-is-back\">The Big Pedal</a>, a round Britain virtual bike ride in which each cycle trip to school earns miles.\"</p> <p>Teachers at a cluster of 12 schools in Hertfordshire have taken part in a new Walk to School initiative - one of them was <a href=\"http://www.cuffleyschool.org/\">Cuffley Primary School</a>, Potter's Bar.</p> <p>Year 6 teacher Alex Bedwell said the school had adopted some novel approaches to get pupils and parents to take a greener approach to the morning and afternoon school journeys. He said: \"We developed an Advent walking bus so each child had a beautifully designed Advent calendar and each time they walked in they got a different tile for the calendar. That was very successful.</p> <p>\"As part of International Walk to School month, I organised for parents to be able to park in church car parks or in the youth centre car park and then I gave each child a passport. There were three main routes they could take to school and so I hid different country's flags for them to spot on their way in. That was great, although it did mean I was out at 5.30am on many mornings standing on my car poking flags into trees.\"</p> <p>Bedwell says the advantages of the schemes are threefold for the school; reducing congestion around school, improving the social aspect of coming to school as children, parents and teachers get to chat on the way and promoting a greater awareness of how small steps taken locally could have an impact on the global environment.</p> <p>Living Street's campaigns enjoy good success with primary schools - but what can teachers in secondary schools do to get their pupils walking?</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.boldonschool.com/\">Boldon Secondary School</a>, Boldon Colliery, the pupils have been taking part in a Free your Feet initiative. Assistant head teacher David Fairclough said: We held assemblies and talked about the health and environmental benefits of walking. They were all given diaries for the week of Free your Feet and so they could track how far they had walked. We tried to encourage them to do at least one day per week or at least come on their bikes. They got badges which became really popular and also at the end of it there was a reward of \u00a350 for the person who had done the most miles.\"</p> <p>He is pleased that the habit of walking and cycling has been seen to continue in the school and the school will focus on it for one week per year to try and bring its importance back to the fore.</p> <p>\"Parking is a perennial problem for us. It has a monumental impact on the school, roads and the environment. I wouldn't say we have solved the problem as we still have parents driving from less than half a mile away but the students are much more aware of the health and environmental impact of their choices.\"</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>No one becomes a sporting superstar alone. Behind them lies a legion of coaches, mentors and sports organisations. Likewise, development is a joint pursuit. Achieving public goals around education, health and other life-enhancing attributes requires a supporting infrastructure. So what happens when you bring the two together - sport and development - in genuine partnership?</p> <p>That was the question Guardian Sustainable Business put to a panel of experts. Poised at their keyboards and ready for debate were: Tom Burstow, head of International Inspiration, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UNICEF UK</a>; Jon Long, head of executive programmes, <a href=\"http://www.internationalcricketcouncil.org/\" title=\"\">International Cricket Council</a> (ICC); John Shiels, chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.mufoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Manchester United Foundation</a>; Ned Wills, director, <a href=\"http://www.laureus.com/foundation\" title=\"\">Laureus Sport for Good Foundation</a>; Tim Vine, head of public affairs, <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html\" title=\"\">Premier League</a>; and Simon White, managing director at <a href=\"http://www.momentum-uk.org/\" title=\"\">Momentum UK</a>.</p> <h2>Getting the basics straight</h2> <p>Sport for development. Does the idea even stack up? Right off the bat, the panel found itself defending the basic premise of the debate. Long at the ICC was first to the defence. He pointed to a \"growing body of evidence\" that proves the \"social and financial return\" on investing in sport for development. He specifically cited academics <a href=\"http://us.macmillan.com/businessleadershipandthelessonsfromsport/HansWesterbeek\" title=\"\">Aaron Smith and Hans Westerbeek</a>, whose research highlights the unique ability of sports to generate social interaction, positive health impacts, cultural integration, and so on. Shiels of the Manchester United Foundation backed this up with the example of a football programme in Sierra Leone. Run in association with UNICEF and geared towards HIV/AIDS awareness, the initiative resulted in a 20% jump in condom use.</p> <p>Despite this and many other positive examples, the panel conceded that evidence from the sport-for-development field had to move from the anecdotal to the empirical. \"We do need to better communicate sport and its value, not just describing a generic benefit or catch all that sport is just great\", admitted UNICEF's Burstow. ICC's Long was equally frank about the problem. Inputs are much easier to capture than outputs, he conceded, \"particularly when working across a range of markets, cultures and languages\". However, Wills at Laureus Sport for Good Foundation insisted progress is being made around impact measurement. He points to InFocus, a bespoke system co-developed by Laureus for project management and global data collection. The system works by identifying output objectives up front, \"searching for evidence of those outcomes\" and then aggregating these across a range of programmes.</p> <h2>Establishing sound partnerships</h2> <p>The question of measurement is important, but it jumps the gun somewhat. If you're to measure impacts, you need to generate them first. And that requires effective partnerships. What do such partnerships look like? Vine of the Premier League pointed to two fundamental factors. One, find a partner that has reach. Two, find partners with local know-how. For the first, the Premier League turned to the British Council, which counts offices in over 100 countries. For the second, it identified a range of NGOs with \"vast experience on the ground\" - Right to Play in Africa, for instance, or the Rafa Marquz Foundation in Mexico. ICC's Long agreed that choosing an umbrella organisation with local expertise and \"bona-fide\" networks is essential. In ICC's case, UNICEF fitted that bill. \"With limited resource, it is pointless trying to re-invent the wheel\", he argued. \"It is far better to work with experts and recognised best in field.\"</p> <h2>Building a business case</h2> <p>Panelists also stressed the importance of mutual learning and shared benefits. \"The resources of large sporting organisations are of course invaluable for development programmes\", said a contributor from StreetFootballWorld, \"but the real benefit is in the exchange of knowledge and experience.\" Wills felt Laureus' Coach Across America programme with Mercedes Benz illustrates that point exactly. The automaker has its eye on the next generation of car buyers. By working with youth in under-served communities in the US, it is \"talking now to [its] future customers\". Clearly there needs to be a business incentive for companies to get involved, otherwise it all comes down to the whims of \"the Chairman's chequebook\", said Long. Firms need to consider what media coverage they might gain, for example, or what employee or product benefits might emerge. \"It can sound a bit brutal but at the end of the day, unless the company is indulging the chairman's passion, it will boil down to a business decision\", Long spelt out. Not that philanthropy isn't important. The Premier League's Vine was keen to rebuff the \"misconception\" that football clubs only invested in youth programmes so as to find the next Didier Drogba. Clubs and players genuinely want to help young people play football or gain an education, he said.</p> <h2>Leaving a lasting legacy</h2> <p>A number of readers voiced about financial sustainability. What happens when the funding finishes? With the focus now squarely on sport and \"social legacy\", it's a legitimate question. \"Chucking a few free T-shirts and some signed photos around is NOT the way to go\", White at Momentum UK stressed. While it was widely agreed that sport-stars can bring kudos and coverage to development projects, White urged against \"shallow engagement\" that relies too heavily on \"the fame of sport\". Better, said ICC's Shiels, to ensure that long-term building blocks are in place. That means stadia and sports facilities, of course. But it also means competent local personnel. As he put it: \"In many instances we would like to train local people, so that if and when funding stops we have people in place locally to take it on.\"</p> <p>Lessons can also be learned from International Inspiration, the London 2012 Olympics' primary legacy programme. So said Burstow of UNICEF, which is heavily involved in the initiative. Where short-term impacts mature into long-term outcomes is when government gets involved, he argued. For that reason, UNICEF is working with town and city mayors in Brazil ahead of the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics to encourage them to invest in \"opportunities for sport and play\". Vine of the Premier League reinforced the point. The League's flagship Premier Skills project seeks to involve the ministries of youth, education and sport wherever possible. \"It is important that Govts [sic] understand the work we are delivering, and hopefully feel compelled to build on what we have started.\" Oh, and don't forget to involve young people themselves. \"Rigid\" and \"inflexible\" projects \"set up by a load of 'suits' with little understanding\" won't go the distance, Vine warned. \"Much better that the youngsters involved are at the heart of it, feel ownership of it, and become key people in driving it forward.\"</p> <p>To read the full discussion, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/partnerships-sporting-development-organisations-live-discussion\" title=\"\">please click here</a>.</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Photograph: Ling/Associated Newspapers</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Updated 9.45am Saturday:</strong></em> Despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/30/crispin-aubrey\">The Guardian publishing an obituary on Sunday</a> of the journalistic campaigner Crispin Aubrey, his death at the age of 66 has received too little coverage.</p> <p>He featured in one of the more bizarre episodes in the chequered history of the use/misuse of the official secrets act (OSA) against journalists. </p> <p>Under that act, Aubrey - then working for Time Out magazine covering the environment and nuclear energy - was arrested in February 1977 along with Duncan Campbell, a freelance investigative journalist, and John Berry, a social worker who had once been a corporal in signals intelligence (SigInt).</p> <p>The three had been drawn together in their opposition to the deportation orders made against another Time Out journalist, Mark Hosenball, and a former CIA agent, Philip Agee.</p> <p>Hosenball (jointly with Campbell) had written an expos\u00e9 of GCHQ, the government's communications headquarters in Cheltenham, and he was considered by the then Labour government to be a threat to national security, as was Agee who had written a book called <em>Inside the Company: CIA Diary</em>. </p> <p>Aubrey mounted a campaign on behalf of his colleague against the deportations and was joined by Campbell - who had wide and detailed knowledge of covert surveillance techniques - and Berry.</p> <p>The three were arrested by special branch as they left Berry's flat and held in Brixton prison. Aubrey and Campbell were charged under section 2 of the OSA with the unauthorised receipt of classified information; Berry was charged with giving it to them.</p> <p>Their homes were searched, and Campbell's flat in Brighton, close to where I lived, was ransacked, as I witnessed at first hand. So, when he was bailed, he took shelter with my wife and I for a couple of weeks.</p> <p>What transpired was one of the more farcical episodes of an affair that, in retrospect, can be seen as a fiasco. Our Brighton home was already under watch from the special branch because my wife had been visiting an Irish republican prisoner.</p> <p>Now a second branch man was detailed to keep tabs on Campbell. We joked that we had one at the front of the house and another at the back. </p> <p>The following year Aubrey, Berry and Campbell appeared in court in what was known as the ABC trial (an acronym of their surnames). By that time, the three had been lionised by the left and a defence campaign had been launched with the solid backing of the National Union of Journalists. </p> <p>There was considerable disquiet about the trio being prosecuted at all and then further alarm when Campbell was also accused of breaching section 1 of the OSA.</p> <p>More controversy followed when the government produced SigInt witnesses known as Colonel A, Colonel B, and Mr C. Two weeks in, the trial had to be abandoned.</p> <p>The defence discovered that the jury foreman was a former SAS officer and that two other jurors had signed the official secrets act. The judge initially refused to stop the trial on those grounds but was forced to do so when the late Christopher Hitchens appeared on television to reveal the secret of the jury's composition.</p> <p>At the second trial, a new judge, Mr Justice Mars-Jones, announced himself \"extremely unhappy\" at what he called an \"oppressive prosecution\". The section 1 charge was dropped and though the three had no defence to the section 2 charges, he gave Berry a suspended jail sentence and conditionally discharged Aubrey and Campbell. They had been expecting to go to prison.</p> <p>After the trial, Aubrey wrote a book entitled <em>Who's Watching You? Britain's Security Service and the Officials Secrets Act</em>, which was published in 1981.</p> <p>He went on being a journalist, remained steadfastly true to his principles and continued being an anti-nuclear campaigner right up until his death last Friday (28 September) at his home in Somerset. He was due to speak at <a href=\"http://stophinkley.org/StopPress.htm\">next weekend's Stop Hinckley campaign rally</a>. </p> <p>For the record, Philip Agee died in 2008. Mark Hosenball continued in journalism and now works for Reuters, which occasionally brings him to London. He has broken several stories about the News International phone hacking affair. </p> <p>Duncan Campbell lives in Brighton - I bumped into him during the summer - and he remains an investigative journalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Campbell_%28journalist%29\">with a penchant for upsetting the establishment.</a></p> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> In the original version of this posting I said I had no idea what happened to John Berry. I am happy to report that he and his partner Linda moved to the same patch of Somerset as Crispin and his wife, Sue, and continued their work as social workers. They are still there.</p> <p>This information comes from Duncan Campbell (not the one mentioned above, but the former Guardian staffer who also happened to be news editor of Time Out at the time of the ABC case and who, incidentally, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/30/crispin-aubrey\">wrote Crispin's obituary</a>).</p> <p>He tells me that when the ABC trio first appeared before magistrates, he made a statement on their behalf outside the court. A picture of him duly appeared on the front page of The Scotsman inevitably mistaking him for his arrested namesake. </p> <p>The caption read: \"Duncan Campbell who faces charges under the Official Secrets Act. His widowed mother lives in Dundee.\" It was a shock at breakfast for his mother and father who lived in The Scotsman's home city of Edinburgh.</p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/30/crispin-aubrey\">The Guardian</a>/<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19718052\">BBC</a>/<a href=\"\">Western Daily Press</a>/<a href=\"http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2012/news/journalist-and-anti-nuclear-campaigner-dies-aged-66/\">HoldTheFrontPage</a>/Personal knowledge/Personal communications</p>",

  "<p>The actor Daryl Hannah was arrested in northeast Texas on Thursday, along with a landowner as the pair protested against an oil pipeline designed to bring crude from Canada to the Gulf Coast.</p> <p>\"They've arrested Daryl Hannah and a rural Texas great-grandmother,\" said Paul Bassis, Hannah's attorney.</p> <p>Hannah and Eleanor Fairchild were standing in front of heavy equipment in an attempt to halt construction of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/18/obama-administration-rejects-keystone-xl-pipeline\" title=\"\">Keystone XL pipeline</a> on Fairchild's farm in Winnsboro, a town about 100 miles east of Dallas. They were arrested for criminal trespassing and taken to the Wood County Jail, Bassis said.</p> <p>Hannah has long opposed TransCanada's construction of the $7bn pipeline, which is designed to transport heavy tar-sands crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Texas' Gulf Coast refineries.</p> <p>\"It is unfortunate Ms Hannah and other out-of-state activists have chosen to break the law by illegally trespassing on private property,\" David Dodson, a spokesman for TransCanada, said in a statement. He also said protesters were \"putting their own safety and the safety of others at risk\".</p> <p>Hannah \u2013 who has starred in dozens of movies, including Kill Bill and Splash \u2013 also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/30/daryl-hannah-arrested-at-white-house\" title=\"\">was arrested in August 2011 while protesting against the pipeline in Washington</a>.

They also say refining the oil would further contaminate the air in a region that has long struggled with pollution.</p> <p>TransCanada says its pipeline would be the safest ever built, and that the crude is no dirtier than oil currently arriving from Venezuela or parts of California.</p> <p>The issue became politically charged when congressional Republicans gave President Barack Obama 60 days to decide whether TransCanada should be granted the necessary permit for the pipeline to cross an international border before snaking its way 1,700 miles south to the Texas coast.</p> <p>Obama, saying his administration did not have enough time to study the potential environmental impacts, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jan/18/obama-administration-rejects-keystone-xl-pipeline\" title=\"\">denied the permit in January</a>.</p> <p>However, he encouraged TransCanada to reroute the northern portion of the pipeline to avoid an environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska. He also promised to expedite permitting of a southern portion of the pipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma, to the Gulf Coast to relieve a bottleneck at the Cushing refinery.</p> <p>TransCanada began construction of that portion of the pipeline this summer after receiving the necessary permits.

His claim that Labour is now the country's \"one nation party\" was hardly original: Tony Blair said exactly the same thing <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-says-labour-the-one-nation-party-1573263.html\" title=\"\">back in February 1995</a>. Still, it has caught the imagination of the media and may even cut through to the electorate. If it does, however, the Tories only have themselves to blame. Miliband, like Blair before him, is simply exploiting a gaping hole left at the heart of the Conservative party by the <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/juncture/171/9726/whither-the-tory-left\" title=\"\">virtual disappearance of the Tory left</a>.</p> <p>In an essay for the Institute for Public Policy Research journal <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/juncture/166\" title=\"\">Juncture</a>, I argue that the so-called progressive, \"one-nation\", Tories constituted the parliamentary party's centre of gravity from the 50s through to the mid-70s. For these Tories, mass unemployment was not only economically irrational but morally indefensible. The welfare state and mixed economy was a necessary, even welcome corrective to market failure and trade unionism a power that needed channelling rather than crushing.</p> <p>Socially, a degree of multiculturalism was an inevitable legacy of Britain's imperial past that may as well be embraced rather than railed against. Prison worked, but law and order had to be about prevention and rehabilitation, too. Comprehensive schooling and mass higher education (though rarely good enough for their own children) was more likely than a divisively selective and elitist system to help the UK compete in a rapidly Europeanising economy.</p> <p>It was these views \u2013 maintained partly out of conviction, partly out of calculation \u2013 that prompted many of the U-turns that helped ensure that the initially rather rightwing Heath administration ended up as the government most Tories love to hate. Yet progressives might have retained control of the party after the election defeats of 1974 had they handled its aftermath more adroitly. By not insisting their beleaguered leader step down in favour of a trusted successor, however, they allowed Margaret Thatcher \u2013 a woman they badly underestimated \u2013 to mount what turned out to be one of the most effective insurgencies in British political history. Before they knew it, she was handing over the key policy portfolios to fellow rightwingers and beginning to shunt those she saw as irredeemable patricians into the sidings.</p> <p>After 1979, a combination of Thatcher's stunning electoral success and generational replacement within the parliamentary party \u2013 plus the increasingly poisonous politics of Europe \u2013 meant that even those leftwingers whose talent made them individually indispensable (Ken Clarke being the paradigmatic example) quickly found themselves fewer and farther between. As a result, while the Tories may have dumped Thatcher in 1990, they have never managed to dump Thatcherism.</p> <p>There were some who believed that David Cameron would finally help them do so. But as leader of the opposition, Cameron never really had any of the big arguments with his party that anyone driving genuine change needs to have \u2013 not so much because he was scared to, but because, once one scratched away their social liberalism and their affected concern for the environment and public services, he and those around him were no less Thatcherite than the rest.</p> <p>Because there was no transformation towards post-Thatcherism, let alone pre-Thatcherism, Cameron as prime minister now finds himself faced with a party in parliament and a party in the media which borders on the delusional \u2013 unable to accept that simply swallowing more and more of the medicine once prescribed by their heroine might not do the job this time around. More pressingly, the gap between the Tories and the Lib Dems is proving much bigger than creative thinkers on the Conservative side, such as <a href=\"http://www.nickbolesmp.com/\" title=\"\">Nick Boles</a>, hoped that it might be \u2013 precisely because the number of his Conservative colleagues ideologically willing and able to reach across it proved vanishingly small.</p> <p>The most important gap, however, is the one that the shock-troops of \"one-nation Labour\" (presuming for the moment they are more than a phantom army) look set to pour into, namely the gap between what a 21st century electorate want from a Tory government \u2013 a blend of competence and compassion, willing to take on vested interests in the private as well as the public sector in order to show that we really are \"all in this together\" \u2013 and what they are currently getting.</p> <p>The problem for the Tories is that there are so few of them who understand this. Because the party's left failed to recover from the extinction-level event that hit it in 1975, there is no way the pendulum can swing back.</p> <p>Back before Disraeli, another Tory icon Edmund Burke reminded reactionaries that \"a state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation\". The same goes for a political party. Without a genuine balance of forces that ensures the presence of people prepared to challenge the prevailing wisdom, a damaging groupthink can develop, blinkering the majority that buys into it into believing that there is no alternative.</p> <p>Occasionally, of course, they are right. But if they are wrong, the results can be disastrous.</p>",
  "<p>Over the course of the past seven years, I have become closely acquainted with international anti-corruption conventions and know a thing or two about multilateral anti-corruption instruments.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/26/open-government-partnership-francis-maude\" title=\"\">Open Government Partnership</a> stands out because of its focus on citizens. By 2011, something that started life in late 2009 as a US directive, urging all US executive departments and agencies to pursue transparency, enable participation and collaboration and improve communication with citizens, had become a multilateral initiative supported by eight countries. It is now a community of 57 member countries committed to implementing these aims for their 2 billion citizens.</p> <p>Citizens are to be consulted in the development of new OGP commitments, and they are to be empowered in the quest for transparency, accountability and improved governance. So yes, the<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/03/open-government-partnership-anniversary\" title=\"\"> enthusiasm the OGP has managed to garner</a> in a relatively short amount of time is warranted.</p> <p>However, there are still some potential pitfalls that we must consider.</p> <p>First, it is likely that citizens of many of the participating countries are not aware of the initiative and consequently cannot make the most of it. Will this influence the UK,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/26/open-government-partnership-francis-maude\" title=\"\"> new co-chair of the OGP</a>, to work hard over the next 12 months towards communicating the opportunities of open government?</p> <p>Second, the romantic belief that everyone will want to take part in policy-making and other political processes, if and when technology makes it simpler or more effective, does not necessarily hold true. Most countries, whether or not they form part of the OGP community, haveapathetic citizens. For example, an online petition in Germany did not bring about dramatic change in democratic participation and citizen engagement. As US history and politics lecturer Matthew Lasar <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/2011/04/do-e-petitions-change-government-germanys-experiment/\" title=\"\">has noted</a>, it is the already politically engaged who tend to embrace these sort of tools, not the disengaged.</p> <p>We hope that an e-petition platform soon to be launched in Montenegro will not share the same fate.</p> <p>There are practical difficulties, too. Open data portals may be a valuable source of information, but they are not really the first web page an ordinary citizen visits over their morning coffee. Large screens full of .xsl tables can seem daunting and unintelligible.</p> <p>For open data to reach its full potential to help people monitor government performance or make informed choices on the use of public services, data must be put in a context and should tell a story people can care about. I fell in love with the tale of <a href=\"http://blog.okfn.org/2010/10/29/open-data-in-public-private-partnerships-how-citizens-can-become-true-watchdogs/\" title=\"\">citizens overseeing a public-private partnership in Brussels</a>, which was about access to bike-sharing schemes.</p> <p>There needs to be engagement around data, and many, many iterations based on feedback loops to get it right and effect a change in behaviour \u2013 just as this down-to-earth use of open data <a href=\"http://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">mappublic toilets in the UK</a> did. But my favourite application, by far, is this visualisation of public budgets: <a href=\"http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org/\" title=\"\">Where does my money go? </a>We liked this so much that we are also about to visualise Montenegro's national budget.</p> <p>Third, the OGP lacks a set of standards against which progress in the participating countries can be measured. The monitoring mechanism is still to be proven effective, though admittedly the OGP has been much more agile in setting it up than, say, the Conference of States Parties to the UN Convention against corruption. We want to see a change in lives and a change to citizens' interaction with their governments \u2013 which is the ultimate point \u2013 and such goals are far from easy in the short term.</p> <p>Let's hope that the new chairmanship, boosted by the launch of the independent review mechanism, the independent process that allows domestic civil society in each OGP country to report on their government's implementation of its OGP action plan, will steer the OGP effectively and cast away some of the doubts about OGP staffing and vision expressed in some recent posts by <a href=\"http://www.globalintegrity.org/comment/1305\" title=\"\">NGO Global Integrity</a>.</p> <p><em>Marija Novkovic is a project manager for the </em><a href=\"http://www.undp.org.me/\" title=\"\"><em>United Nations Development Programme Montenegro.</em></a><em> She writes in a personal capacity </em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>According to a relative who's taken part in the past, the annual <a href=\"http://royalparkshalf.com/runners/race-day/\">Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon</a> has many virtues, not the least of which is that it's nice and flat. It's also pretty glamorous, with its <a href=\"http://royalparkshalf.com/files/images/uploads/larger-map.jpg\">route (pdf)</a> taking in the central London green spaces of Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, Green Park and St James's Park, as well as Admiralty Arch and a stretch of the Embankment. I'll be among the 12,500 runners this year, <a href=\"http://fundraise.unicef.org.uk/MyPage/Dave-Hill-Royal-Parks-Run\">raising money for Unicef</a> in the process.</p> <p>The four parks themselves have outstandingly chequered pasts, as I've learned in the course of some brief research into each of them (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/davehillblog/2012/sep/28/royal-parks-half-marathon-unicef\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/davehillblog/2012/jul/20/london-royal-parks-half-marathon-unicef\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2012/sep/21/royal-parks-half-marathon-st-james-park-unicef\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2012/sep/14/kensington-gardens-half-marathon-unicef\">here</a>). Imagining these illustrious, regal urban lungs in the heart of the capital as having once been the outlying haunts of lepers, duelists and highwaymen is a reminder of how chaotic and lawless the city's history has often been and a simple but vivid illustration of how massively it's grown.</p> <p>Having acquired an addiction to the London Marathon in recent years, I've learned that one of the tricks of long distance running is to periodically switch your attention from the pain in your legs and just try to enjoy the scenery.

  "<p>Jim Murphy is one of the many senior Labour figures to have begun his political career as president of the National Union of Students. During his mid-90s tenure there, he dropped \u2013 against the union's own conference resolutions \u2013 all opposition to the abolition of student grants, helping to ensure that in future an education would come at the cost of crippling debt and insecurity. When reading the following, bear this in mind.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1136931.ece\" title=\"\">My biggest priority in politics</a>,\" the shadow defence secretary said this week, \"is about working-class parents having middle-class kids. I want parents to have the chance to bring up kids who do better than them.\" On the face of it, this is a normal centre-left response to the very real decline of social mobility, however much that decline might have been assisted by Murphy's tenure at the NUS. It's given some additional pertinence by Labour's admission that currently the next generation will be worse off than their parents. An \"inherited poverty\", as Murphy puts it, now stands in the way of young working-class people's \"aspirations\".</p> <p>The details are pretty light on the ground, but given the lack of much change in Labour's ideas about education \u2013 after all, it commissioned the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/22/brownes-plans-knowledge-in-decline\" title=\"\">Browne report that trebled tuition fees and proposed 100% cuts to arts funding</a> \u2013 we can expect the solution to be the debt, marketisation and expansion that were New Labour education policy. Sotto voce, there's something else going on here \u2013 the explicit abandonment of the idea that, for the labour movement, you \"<a href=\"http://thegreatunrest.net/2011/04/08/why-social-mobility-is-shit-ii/\" title=\"\">rise with your class, not out of it</a>\".</p> <p>Rising out of your class can lead to all manner of things. Kicking away the ladder after you've climbed up, as working-class Glaswegian Murphy did as a student leader; or the kind of up-by-the-bootstraps rightwing individualism that Norman Tebbit specialised in; or, at best, an acknowledgement that your privilege and success are deeply unusual and unrepresentative. </p> <p>My father is a middle manager at a software company. He left school at 14 and worked as a sheet metal worker (as had his father) for most of the next 30 years, becoming shop steward and then convener, and a Labour, or rather Militant, activist. He read, and reads, voraciously, in history, politics and economics, everything from Marx to Thucydides, to the point where he's far more erudite than many people I know who went to university. This didn't make him \"socially mobile\", at least not until he finally got sick of bending pieces of metal every day and sought a promotion off the shop floor. The working class was no longer showing much signs of rising; so he rose out of it, at least in economic terms.</p> <p>Later I did the same, through the conventional route of university. A decade or so after that my mother followed suit, going via a job in the NHS from a council estate single mum to a qualified radiologist. In theory we are all marvellous success stories of social mobility. So why does Murphy's rhetoric make me feel so uncomfortable?</p> <p>What made all of us able to rise out of our class was a culture based on the class rising collectively. The culture of the Labour movement \u2013 its literature, its debates, its prizing of learning as a means of struggle, its insistence that \"knowledge is power\" \u2013 is what made my parents educate themselves in the first place. Being brought up in that environment, being unafraid of books and intellectual argument, meant that I had the confidence to cope easily with the very different intellectual culture of university, without being intimidated by its privilege.</p> <p>Those books in the shelves at home \u2013 EP Thompson's Making of the English Working Class, say, or Lenin's What is to be Done? \u2013 were about the class, as a collectively organised body, educating itself and advancing itself, with the aim of abolishing itself and creating a society without classes, something both my parents once thought they might live to see. We used that culture of knowledge and self-education for advancement into a different class. We did well. The working class as a whole very obviously didn't, as the culture that helped us up had been deliberately destroyed. For my parents especially, it was at the very least a pyrrhic victory.</p> <p>Labour has never, even in its more leftwing moments, been that concerned about abolishing class altogether, though some of its leaders might once have kidded themselves that \"we are all middle class now\", something hard to sustain as the gap between rich and poor became ever more drastic. They did promise a reform of the class structure, so that there was at least \"equality of opportunity\" between classes, something that has been honoured more in the breach.</p> <p>As the labour movement, with its own educational institutions, becomes more distant from the Labour party, it can only dangle the hope for individual self-advancement \u2013 the chance that you, too, could get on in the rat race. Murphy might remember <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v33/n11/neal-ascherson/wolves-in-the-drawing-room\" title=\"\">the words of another Scottish politician, Jimmy Reid</a>, who used to like to walk around Glasgow tower blocks and point out how in one there was a Formula One champion and in another the winner of a yacht race \u2013 who would never get the chance to sit at the wheel of a racing car or a yacht.</p> <p>But Murphy, and Labour as a whole, have long forgotten his other point, made in his famous 1972 speech to Glasgow University \u2013 that \"the rat race is for rats\". Reid continued: \"Reject the insidious pressures in society that would blunt your critical faculties to all that is happening around you, that would caution silence in the face of injustice lest you jeopardise your chances of promotion and self-advancement. This is how it starts, and, before you know where you are, you're a fully paid-up member of the rat pack. The price is too high.\" Around \u00a39,000 a year, to be precise.</p>",

  "<p>I drag myself out of bed about 7.30am, grab some porridge with honey and bananas for breakfast and \u2013 if I'm in university that day \u2013 walk to campus, which is about two minutes away.</p> <p>I will have university one day a week and placement the other four days this year, now I'm in my second year. The day that I'm in university will be quite a long day \u2013 8.30am until 4-5pm.</p> <p>Everyone has a different placement. Some are quite similar. Last year I was working at a children's centre, under-fives and their families. That was quite good. I don't know my placement for this year yet. But it will be less university time and more placement time. There's a real emphasis on more practical learning.</p> <p>Lectures can be an hour or two. Personally, I really enjoy the ethics and body language and communication is the sort of stuff I'm really interested in. But everyone has their own preference. I know some people enjoy the law part; I don't like that \u2013 it's a bit dry.</p> <p>I'm at the University of Plymouth. We have six learning themes throughout the social work course. These consist of \"approaches to social work\"; \"contexts for social work\"; \"understanding the social world\"; \"values, attitudes and beliefs\"; \"wellbeing and social work\"; and \"what is social work?\" However, later in the course \"understanding the social world\", \"values attitudes and beliefs\" and \"what is social work?\" are integrated within teaching and will not feature as weekly teaching sessions.</p> <p>Relevant law and policy will also be covered, and there is a strong emphasis on the global perspective, as well a local and national one. There is also an emphasis of the service user being the expert.</p> <p>I usually grab lunch on campus. It's good because me and my course mates usually go to lectures together, then hang around to have lunch together. I think that's when a lot of real learning happens \u2013 when you're discussing what you've been taught.</p> <p>There is 56 people in my year group, with only eight men. In the previous years we have had practical sessions and also share learning experiences from practice during our tutor sessions. The university also arranges conferences and attending these are mandatory.</p> <p>We have assignments in which we must incorporate all learning themes, and often critically explore our practice. We also have an OSPA (observed simulated practice assessment) in which we receive information, video clips and audio clips of a fictional referral to social service. We must then complete an initial assessment under exam conditions. I usually stay on campus to do work. Last year I went back home, but it's too noisy to do work where I am now.</p> <p>I usually unwind on my Xbox, but I also like rock climbing. There's quite a good social life in Plymouth. Obviously, because we're on placement and we have a lot on at university we don't go out as much as other students \u2013 it's not really a party course. But we do have the weekends ...</p> <p>I decided to study social work because I was working as a refrigerator engineer \u2013 and I hated it because I was working with machines, and I didn't really care. I wanted to work with people.</p> <p>I think I want to go into child protection for a little while. I hear that there's a high burnout rate so not for too long though. I'm not sure what area I'll want to go into afterwards.</p> <p>If I was to give advice to social work students, I would say it's really, really hard and it's a lot of work. But it's really rewarding too, so I think if you're going to go into it then you have to do it whole-heartedly.</p> <p>I don't sleep very well, so I usually go to bed after 2am. The last thing I usually think about is that I should be asleep already.</p> <p><em>If you know someone who you would like us to feature in our Day in the life of ... series, let us know by </em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>emailing us</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

  "<p>After a series of personal tragedies, Derek Langford hit rock bottom last year \u2013 he suffered a breakdown, took solace in drink and finally, attempted to take his own life.</p> <p>Mercifully, the pills did not work and he found his way \u2013 via his community psychiatric nurse \u2013 to a Green Gym near his home in Birmingham's Sandwell neighbourhood. The project, designed to improve people's mental and physical wellbeing through their involvement in conservation activities and run by <a href=\"http://www.tcv.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Conservation Volunteers (TCV)</a>, has renewed his zest for life.</p> <p>\"I really was a total mess,\" admits Langford, 43, a former tarmacker. \"For months I just sat there, drinking \u2013 I just couldn't get out of it. I'm still living day by day, but overall I'm now in a much better place.\"</p> <p>Since last June, Langford has attended the Green Gym twice a week \u2013 frequently taking part in off-site activities such as dry-stone walling and hedge-laying and sometimes helping out at educational events for young people. He has made new friends and developed an appreciation of the importance of the environment.</p> <p>Along the way, he attended training courses and has now been made a team leader, with responsibilities which include carrying out risk assessments on new project sites. Separately, in the evenings, he also started volunteering with a local homeless project.</p> <p>Green Gym is just one of the initiatives run by TCV, a charity which works to reclaim and protect green spaces across the UK. Most of its practical projects take place on other people's land \u2013 National Trust sites, for example, or local authority parks or school grounds. Many of TCV's participants \u2013 or volunteers, as the charity prefers to call them \u2013 have additional needs, for example through disability, mental illness or a history of substance abuse.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.tcv.org.uk/hollybush\" title=\"\">Hollybush Centre</a> in Kirkstall, Leeds, has been running for 30 years, and is part way through a four-year grant from the Big Lottery Fund. Working closely with <a href=\"http://www.leedsmind.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Leeds Mind</a>, the NHS and, sometimes organisations in the housing or social sectors, it sends volunteers to build pocket parks and recreation spaces, remove invasive species and repair walls on the Pennine moors. It also offers gardening and cooking sessions for those less happy to go out in the minibus.</p> <p>Individuals can be referred by services such as drug and alcohol support, <a href=\"http://www.mencap.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mencap</a>, hospital occupational therapy and job centres, as well as self-referrals.</p> <p>Increasingly, staff are trying to gauge participants' interests and moving them towards employment, and this year they started working with <a href=\"http://www.leedscommunityhealthcare.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Leeds Community Healthcare</a> \u2013 formerly the PCT \u2013 to encourage volunteers who want help tackling their alcohol use, smoking or weight problems.</p> <p>In turn, GPs and other clinicians may suggest that patients consider volunteering with TCV as a means of increasing their activity levels.</p> <p>Hollybush manager John Preston says: \"In any given group you might see people with a brain injury, someone with a sensory impairment such as deafness, and people with profound cognitive impairments, who may struggle to remember things.</p> <p>\"Some of our volunteers can be very isolated \u2013 we sometimes become a key part of people's social and even family life in some ways, because of the amount of time they spend here.\"</p> <p>Preston says those in the organisation often develop good relationships, because volunteers turn to them when they are in distress \"because they know us.\"</p> <p>\"When one long-standing volunteer who had mental health and alcohol issues suffered a relapse but was refusing to go to A&amp;E, we were able to intervene, make contact with that person's partner and bring the problem under control,\" he says. \"People come here and we give them the space to do things. We try to give them more responsibilities \u2013 in time they may end up running a group.\"</p> <p>The centre's 12 staff rely on a team of voluntary supervisors or \"key volunteers\" to help run their activities; attendees who have been promoted, retired people and sometimes social care students. In time, Preston also hopes to develop an evening \"friends of\" group, which would allow volunteers who have moved on to maintain a relationship with TCV and their peers.</p> <p>Encouraging individuals to take on more responsibility can have a huge impact on their lives. Preston fondly recalls one volunteer who, before arriving at Hollybush, had barely left his home for four years because he was horribly bullied at work. After a stint of volunteering, the same man was able to get up and speak to TCV's national board of directors. He recently began a two-day-a-week diploma course and is now searching for part-time work.</p> <p>Back in Birmingam, Langford is also acutely aware of the value of this approach. \"The people who run the Green Gym have a lot of faith in me and see my potential,\" he says. \"I had lost faith in myself but my confidence has come back up and I now have the will to live again.\"</p> <p><em>Starting on Friday 5 October, </em><a href=\"http://www.tcv.org.uk/biggreenweekend\" title=\"\"><em>The Conservation Volunteers' Big Green Weekend</em></a><em> aims to encourage people to get involved in looking after their local green places, from creating community gardens and clearing footpaths to conducting wildlife surveys and fundraising for local conservation projects</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Samsung Electronics says it will report a record quarterly operating profit of 8.1tn Korean won (\u00a34.5bn), nearly double last year's and up 25% sequentially, as strong sales of high-end TVs and Galaxy smartphones more than offset reduced orders for chips and screens from Apple, its main rival and leading customer.</p> <p>The figure covers the three months to the end of September. Most analysts, however, expect its run of four straight record quarters to end in December as the South Korean group, the world's leading maker of smartphones, TVs and memory chips, ramps up its marketing to counter Apple's new iPhone and other products in the increasingly crowded and competitive $200bn (\u00a3123.5bn) global smartphone market.</p> <p>The operating profit figure is an estimate provided by Samsung itself in an earnings preview. That beat the consensus from a poll of 26 analysts, who pegged it at 7.6tn won, up from 4.25tn a year ago.</p> <p>Samsung may have spent around $2.7bn on marketing in July-September alone around the London Olympic Games, for which it was a major sponsor, and new Galaxy promotions, Credit Suisse has estimated.</p> <p>This year's expected record profit of 28tn won will also trigger higher performance-related payouts to many of Samsung's 206,000 staff early next year. The business may have to set money aside in the current quarter if it fails in an appeal to overturn a US court verdict from August which awarded more than $1bn in damages to Apple for patent infringements on phones and tablets.</p> <p>\"Fourth-quarter profit will be pressured by one-off expenses: performance payouts and some $1bn in legal provisioning relating to the Apple litigation. Excluding those, core earnings will remain solid and a swing factor is how much Samsung spends on marketing,\" said Lee Sun-tae, analyst at NH Investment &amp; Securities.</p> <p>Analysts expect earnings to decline until the second quarter of next year as a slump in computer sales and a weak global economy sap demand for chips and electronics products.</p> <h2>Smartphone tightrope</h2> <p>\"The biggest risk for Samsung is competitive product line-ups from its rivals such as the iPhone 5. Because handsets drive most of its profits, one misstep in handsets could result in losses for the whole Samsung group,\" said Byun Han-joon, an analyst at KB Investment &amp; Securities.</p> <p>So far though, there is no sign of that happening, with its former key rivals \u2013 Finland's Nokia, Taiwan's HTC and Motorola in the US \u2013 falling behind in both profits and shipments.</p> <p>Profit at Samsung's mobile division is likely to have more than doubled in July-September to around 5tn won \u2013 around two thirds of total group profit \u2013 as smartphone shipments are estimated to have topped 58m, including up to 20m Galaxy S IIIs. Samsung does not give figures for its shipments of smartphones, mobile phones or tablets, which are instead estimated by analysts.</p> <p>The company, valued at around $197bn, estimated its third-quarter revenue at 52tn won, in line with forecasts.</p> <h2>Chips, cheaply? </h2> <p>Strong handset sales compensated for reduced profits from its chip business, as prices of its mainstay dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, used in computers and mobiles, dropped 14% in the September quarter. DRAM chips now trade below what it costs most contract manufacturers to make them, and will squeeze near-term earnings, analysts say.</p> <p>Tablets and smartphones, the real growth areas, use far less storage. Samsung is expected to invest less in chips next year due to the drop in demand, which could be bad news for semiconductor equipment manufacturers such as ASML.</p> <p>Kwon Oh-hyun, promoted to Samsung CEO in June, said late last month that the group has yet to finalise its 2013 investment plans.</p> <p>Samsung is beefing up its product line-up, with the latest phone-cum-tablet Galaxy Note expected to go on sale in the US this month, and its ATIV smartphones that run on Microsoft's new Windows system to compete with Nokia's Lumia series.</p> <h2>Note-taking</h2> <p>Samsung's mobile division chief, JK Shin last, week predicted that sales of its large-screen Galaxy Note II could be three times higher than those of its predecessor model in the three months after launch. That would suggest sales of around 10m devices by the end of this year.</p> <p>Some analysts see the Note II, along with a stripped-down, cheaper version of the flagship Galaxy S III smartphone and rising NAND flash memory chip prices helping Samsung deliver higher fourth-quarter profit. Nomura on Friday predicted October-December profit could be up to 10% more than the 8.1tn won in July-September.</p> <p>In a note on Friday, Citi analyst Henry Kim predicted strong October-December profits, driven by a recovery in semiconductors, though telecoms operating margins could decline by 5 percentage points to 15% as it spends more on marketing. \"The semiconductor division will show the strongest momentum,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite a bruising series of patent disputes and the reputational risk of the US court defeat in August, Samsung's brand value has surged this year as it shipped more handsets and smartphones than any of its rivals. The value of the Samsung brand has jumped to 9th in the world \u2013 up from 17th last year \u2013 at $32.9bn, according to brand consultancy Interbrand. That's more than Toyota Motor, but less than half of second-ranked Apple's $76.6bn.</p>",
  "<p>This year is the bicentennial of the first publication of a work that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/wh-auden\" title=\"\">WH Auden</a> described as one of \"the few indispensable, common-property books upon which western culture can be founded\" and \"next to the Bible in importance\". It also gave us the fictional character with the highest name recognition in the English language, Cinderella (although in 1812, when the book was published in German, the name she had was Ashputtel). The book is <em>Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen</em> (more commonly known as <em>Grimms' Fairy Tales</em>) by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.</p> <p>So it is unsurprising and, indeed, proper that Penguin Classics should produce a new collection of the tales for this Christmas. And frankly, once you have arrived at this point, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/philip-pullman\" title=\"\">Philip Pullman</a> is a shoo-in for the task, because he writes the most limpid, economic narrative prose; because he is already famous for dealing in magical realms (though a very different sort of magic); and, above all perhaps, because he is one of the very few contemporary writers who has written genuine cross-generational fiction. The Grimm Brothers did not set out to record children's stories, and all the anthropological evidence suggests that until well into the 19th century these kinds of oral folk tales were not specifically for children but for everyone. This is nicely reflected in Pullman's subtitle \u2013 \"for young and old\".</p> <p>Pullman has chosen and retold his 50 favourites from the original stories \u2013 50 out of more than 200 means, inevitably, that your own favourites may very well have been omitted. Where is the delightful \"White Snake\" and its charming young servant hero? How could anyone prefer the rambling \"Twelve Brothers\" to the very similar but obviously better \"Six Swans\", with its heroine who laboriously makes shirts out of starwort? But Pullman's selection is fair and wide ranging and embraces most of the types of story. If it is distinctly thin on the more pious tales, that is hardly surprising. Given his well-known views on religion it would prove well nigh impossible to present \"The Three Green Twigs\" or \"Poverty and Humility Lead to Heaven\" as personal favourites. And if any of the stories are going to vanish, these are probably the ones in which there is currently least interest and engagement; even \"pious types\" such as me would not want to lose \"Cinderella\" or \"Rumpelstiltskin\" in favour of \"The Hazel Branch\" or the macabre \"God's Food\".</p> <p>One of the best things that Pullman does in his all-too-short introduction is reiterate the oral tradition from which these stories come \u2013 from a writer's point of view, this means that, though you need to be respectful, you do not need to venerate any pre-existing text. The Grimms themselves did not, adding and subtracting details as their audience demanded (they have been much criticised for this, I have always felt, unfairly; they honoured the tradition of the tales precisely by adapting them to new audiences). Pullman does this with great elegance, for example strangling the husband in \"The Three Snake Leaves\", instead of just chucking him overboard, so that the readers or hearers know he is genuinely dead and so that the rope is available as evidence at the denouement: this really does make the narrative stronger.</p> <p>Elaborating Cinderella's ballgowns into the colours of starlight, moonlight and sunlight (rather than the simpler gold and silver of the Grimms' version) enhances the sense of magic, while allowing her to choose these colours herself reduces her passivity and demonstrates her good taste. One of Pullman's most useful additions is the vastly improved poems and jingles, which are hard to translate closely. His freer versions are catchy and authentic.</p> <p>However, his willingness to write like a storyteller, giving us his own versions of the stories, makes his expressed desire to keep himself back, to create a voice as \"clear as water\" and focus solely on the story rather than a personal interpretation, seem like a contradiction. He writes too well, there is clarity and energy on almost every page, but it is Pullman as clear as a bell.</p> <p>One thing I found fascinating, though strange: he praises the generality and economy of the Grimms' tales and the lack of specificity and description, yet he adds a great deal of detail (none of his versions is shorter than the original, except where he has deliberately omitted narrative digressions). Perhaps written texts require more detail than oral versions, in which expression and gesture can supply nuance.</p> <p>This collection is issued as a \"classic\", so it is probably right to aim for a style free of the gothic extravagance of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/angela-carter\" title=\"\">Angela Carter</a> or the contemporary ethics of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/jane-yolen\" title=\"\">Jane Yolen</a> or any other highly literary or individual interpretation, but for those who already know the stories this results in a collection which is very good, but not very interesting. If I were choosing a collection for someone \u2013 a child, perhaps \u2013 who did not know any of the tales, I would still opt for Jack Zipes's lively translation of the whole oeuvre, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099511441/the-complete-fairy-tales\" title=\"\"><em>The Complete Fairy Tales</em></a>, partly because my favourites (and yours and everyone's) will be there, and partly because it seems a more straightforward and comfortable enterprise.</p> <p>\u2022 Sara Maitland's <em>Gossip from the Forest</em> is published by Granta next month.</p>",
  "<p>\"Sorry to keep you waiting. My snake is about to shed.\" In 25 years of writing this is certainly the most unusual excuse I have ever heard, and Maeve Moorcroft is one of very few people who could get away with it.</p> <p>Moorcroft is head of pets for <a href=\"http://www.petsathome.com/\" title=\"Pets at Home website\">Pets at Home</a>, responsible for all areas of health and welfare of the thousands of animals that pass through the doors of the nationwide chain.</p> <p>I am meeting her the morning after a very difficult evening for both her and Pets at Home: BBC's Watchdog programme had run a lengthy feature on the health of a few of the pets sold by the store. I thought Pets at Home was going to fare quite well after seeing the first segment, which mostly related to a couple of cases of ringworm in guinea pigs; but the second part involved undercover filming in several stores, showing dead fish in tanks. A few looked like they had been dead for several days.</p> <p>\"We were answering calls until 11pm last night,\" Moorcroft says. As we walk around the head office in Wilmslow, Cheshire, it's clear more are still coming in, and one or two colleagues (you are not allowed to use the word \"staff\" at Pets at Home, everyone is a colleague) stop Moorcroft for advice or to ask her to talk to the pet owner on the other end of the line.</p> <p>Moorcroft, who is Irish, qualified as a vet in Dublin in 1990 and spent 10 years working in the Peak District dealing mainly with domestic animals, \"with the odd sheep and wildlife emergency thrown in\". She met her husband to be, a shepherd who now runs their farm, after treating one of his sheepdogs on New Year's Eve, and now has two sons aged seven and five.</p> <p>Like many vets, Moorcroft found that the long and often unsociable hours of being in practice did not fit well with having a family. She switched to working for a pet product manufacturer as their veterinary adviser, helping to make sure their products were safe and suitable.</p> <p>Three years ago she moved to Pets at Home, becoming the first vet to hold the position of head of pets, involved in all areas of health and welfare of the company's pets, fish and reptiles. Among other things, the role involves liaising with suppliers, checking where animals come from, supervising their care in store and overseeing the stores' adoption centres.</p> <p>She runs a team of about 10, including specialists in reptiles and fish, and two veterinary nurses working in a support role. Given the size of the company \u2013 320 stores employing about 5,500 people with a turnover of \u00a312m a week \u2013 this seems quite a modest number.</p> <p>Moorcroft spends part of the morning answering emails and calls, mostly from the stores or vets contacting her about animals bought from Pets at Home, and is briefed by her team on the progress of a new range of guides published in association with the RSPCA and the licensing of various stores.</p> <p>The open-plan office she sits in is like no other I've ever visited. There are a couple of dogs meandering between a selection of baskets and bean bags, and nearly every desk includes an aquarium or vivarium holding a wide array of fish, snakes, reptiles and amphibians. Moorcroft's snake, Jean Genie, sits in a tank on her desk.</p> <p>She moves on to visit a Stockport store with a specialist aquatic centre and featured prominently in the Watchdog programme. The staff are upset, and there is a high manager-to-colleague ratio on the shop floor to reassure staff and deal with customer inquiries.</p> <p>While <a href=\"http://www.petsathome.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Info_10601_watchdog_-1_10551\" title=\"Pets at Home: Response to Matters raised by Watchdog \">Pets at Home disagreed with some of the points</a> made by the BBC programme, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/pets-at-home\" title=\"Pets at Home - Do their pets really come first?\">chief executive Nick Wood issued a statement</a> saying the company would review its health check training and the frequency of the checks on its fish tanks.</p> <p>We meet \"Fishy\" Pete, a marine biologist who is one of Moorcroft's team, to inspect the fish: cold water, tropical and marine. The tanks are spotless and the only inverted fish is one which Pete assures me likes being upside down.</p> <p>Some vets have a poor opinion of pet shops, and until recently the RSPCA has opposed the sale of animals through a shop environment. Has Moorcroft received flack from her veterinary peers for switching over to pet sales? \"Veterinary science is a vocation, and I spent all those years in college because I wanted to help animals. Now I'm in a really good position to do that. Yes I'm one step removed, but I can get things in place to make things better,\" she says.</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Hours</strong> Officially 8.30am to 5pm. Five weeks holiday plus bank holidays.</p> <p><strong>Work-life balance</strong> \"It's better than when I was in practice, and getting better still because of my veterinary nurses.\"</p> <p><strong>Salary</strong> The average starting salary for a vet can be anything between \u00a321,800 and \u00a333,500 a year, depending on experience. However, further training and experience can increase the average salary to around \u00a336,500. Moorcroft's salary is equivalent to that of a senior vet, who can earn upwards of \u00a350,000.</p> <p><strong>Best thing</strong> \"Getting the chance to influence the health of thousands of animals all around the country.\"</p> <p><strong>Worst thing</strong> \"Laying awake at 4am, worrying about guinea pigs and rabbits.\"</p>",
  "<p>Projects to reduce carbon emissions and create sustainable communities may seem ambitious for small community organisations. But community groups across the UK are proving that they can make a contribution to sustainable development when they get support.</p> <p>With the <a href=\"http://www.transitionnetwork.org/\" title=\"\">transition movement</a> providing inspiration and funds, promoting sustainability and environmental initiatives have become a realistic prospect for small organisations. And a project carried out by the University of St Andrews ffound that local authorities' resources and expertise can help communities deliver their ambitions.</p> <p>The project, led by Rehema White, a lecturer in sustainable development, looked at the barriers preventing communities and councils from working together on sustainability. It also tried to bring both parties together.</p> <p>\"Community groups often perceive local authorities as an obstacle to engagement in green activities\", says White. \"But in reality, community groups and local authorities share many common goals. This project aimed to design a strategy for them to work together more effectively.\"</p> <p>Participants in the project included <a href=\"http://nhtt.org.uk/\" title=\"\">North Howe Transition Toun (NHTT)</a>, which at the time was developing plans for a cycle route linking remote communities with nearby transport hubs. Members of the group attended seminars organised by the university which introduced them to Fife council and other local stakeholders.</p> <p>Delegates were encouraged to meet, talk and establish mutually beneficial contacts. White says that staff from the council saw what community groups were doing, including NHTT's plans for the cycle routes, while community members discovered previously unknown council initiatives and areas of expertise.</p> <p>Few people in the community groups realised for example that Fife, with private partners, already collects methane gas from landfill to heat local housing, while the council was not aware that NHTT had received non-council funding to appoint and train local 'energy champions'.</p> <p>Crispin Hayes, director of NHTT, says the seminars were useful in taking the cycle routes project forward. \"There were several people at the council who wanted to move forward on these things. There was a fair bit of negotiation with landowners, some of whom were very intransigent. The council's help with that has been very useful.\"</p> <p>Hayes says that the fact that the council had a maintenance budget was helpful because NHTT only had access to capital funding at the time. \"What enabled this project to happen was for the council to take charge of the maintenance in the long term.\"</p> <p>Another example of a successful partnership between a council and the community is in north London where a tiny organisation in Muswell Hill teamed up with Haringey council on a \u00a3250,000 carbon reduction project. The council worked with <a href=\"http://mhsgroup.org/\" title=\"\">Muswell Hill sustainability group (MHSG)</a> on the bid to the mayor of London's <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/environment/climate-change/low-carbon-zones\" title=\"\">low carbon zone</a> fund. The bid built upon the vision of local people to make Muswell Hill a sustainable community and the broader ambition of the council to achieve a 40% CO2 reduction across the whole borough by 2020. The low carbon zone project, which covered more than 800 homes, was used by the council as a pilot to test how best to engage communities on this agenda.</p> <p>The project originated from the community, who had approached the council with the idea of bidding for the funding. A steering group was set up once the fund was awarded to oversee the project, coordinated by a council officer and made up of members of the Muswell Hill sustainability group, the social enterprise EN10ergy, resident and community volunteer representatives and traders' associations.</p> <p>By the end of the project, 650 doorstep conversations were held and 450 households went on to have a free home energy audit and installed a number of energy saving measures such as light bulbs and chimney balloons. Another 200 residents went on to install larger measures ranging from draught proofing, loft and cavity wall insulation and replacement boilers.</p> <p>Community owned solar panels were installed on the roof of the local Marks and Spencer store and on a local church. The feed-in tariff money received from the panels and sale of shares to local people provided an on-going source of finance for sustainability initiatives, including low cost loans for carbon reduction measures.</p> <p>Peter Thompson, a member of MHSG, says the council played a key role in working with the business community, providing meeting space and launching the low carbon loans. However, he says that it is important for community organisations to retain control in the areas of publicity and communications, rather than allowing the council to puts its stamp upon promotional material.</p> <p>Thompson says he was impressed with the calibre of the council employees he worked with. \"Where we were disappointed is that everything needed, like loan, had to go to legal, finance and it just takes so long.\"</p> <p>Thompson's frustrations, seemingly common complaints about large public sector organisations, are shared by Crispin Hayes. But he says that these problems can be reduced by finding the right people in the council. NHTT did this through the University of St Andrews seminars and by following their own leads.</p> <p>\"The key thing with working with the local authority is identifying a person that will get on and champion your project. They have resources and abilities that complement your group's.\"</p> <p>Thompson says that the low carbon zone project has taken his organisation from being a little group \"making nettle soup\" to delivering a big budget project. He advises other groups that it is essential to have a partnership with the council on a project of this scale. \"They can do things that you as a little group can't.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
