  "<p>Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. </p> <h2>Keith Hackett's verdict</h2> <p><strong>1)</strong> Nothing \u2013 unless the subs are deliberately causing a distraction by making gestures \u2013 in which case you should show them yellow cards. The location of the warm-up area is decided pre-match: you would have confirmed with both teams \u2013 based on competition rules \u2013 where the subs can exercise. This can either be behind the goal if there's space, or behind one of your two assistants. Only if the players were warming up in a non-designated area would you need to move them. <br><em>Thanks to Thomas Price</em>. <br><strong>2)</strong> Award the goal. A penalty taker is allowed to confuse opponents at free kicks or penalty kicks by feinting in the run-up. It's not a yellow card offence unless you deem it unsporting behaviour \u2013 and in this scenario, that does not apply. If he had committed an unsporting act, you would show a second yellow, then a red, and, because the ball went into the net, the penalty would be retaken by a sixth player. <br><em>Michael Preston wins the shirt. </em><br><strong>3)</strong> At best, this is a reckless challenge \u2013 whether or not his trailing foot was touching the ground. The fact that no contact was made is irrelevant. If you judge he denied an obvious goal scoring opportunity, show a red card. If not, show a yellow card. <br><em>Thanks to Charles Leadman</em>.</p> <h2>Competition: win an official club shirt of your choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396535221\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/SPORT/Pix/pictures/2010/8/25/1282726013467/Kitbag-New-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kitbag New\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View the Kitbag range</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a chance to win a club shirt of your choice from the range at <a href=\"http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p=18796&amp;a=1446133&amp;g=512634\">Kitbag.com</a> send us your questions for You are the Ref to <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>Thirty years, and 13 albums on, my favourite French/global band are back and on classic form \u2013 though I must still repeat the one complaint I have made about them in the past. Based in a former farmhouse, out among the vineyards near Angers, they have created a unique style, mixing the poetry and chanson of soulful singer/keyboard player Denis Pa\u00e9n with the sophisticated, attacking, vocals of two Algerian sisters, Yamina and Nadia Nid El Mourid, along with taut, rhythmic backing and the inspired violin work of Richard Bourreau. This album follows much the same formula as the previous 12, but this time round there's an even more exotic soundscape and more experimentation. It starts with the sound of crickets and a poem (in French) read by Robert Wyatt, who reappears adding scat vocals to the drifting title track. Elsewhere, there's a rousing demand for a multicultural French national identity on La Marseillaise en&#xa0;Creole, and instrumental pieces featuring the West African n'goni and Chinese spike fiddle. An impressive set \u2013 but once again the rousing El Mourid sisters are not given the central role they deserve.</p>",
  "<p>It is not the crystal blue waters of the Caribbean that attract the Conservative party treasurer Lord Fink to the Cayman Islands, the British overseas territory nestled between Jamaica and Cuba.</p> <p>He believes UK investment firms such as ISAM, where he is a director, are drawn to the tiny territory for one overriding reason: the island's authority taxes wealthy foreign investors at much lower rates than in Britain.</p> <p>In a frank interview, Fink has called on the government to compete with the island and other offshore havens by easing the tax burden on wealthy foreigners who invest in hedge funds.</p> <p>\"Offshore companies are used for technical reasons, not tax avoidance [by the company],\" he said. \"Many of the structures in the [hedge fund] business have to be based offshore anyway. Otherwise why would a Japanese person investing in a hedge fund want to pay UK tax? All of the industries I am involved in have to have some offshore entities, if only to help those investors.\"</p> <p>Fink said he tried to persuade George Osborne three and a half years ago that he should change UK tax rules \u2013 under which gains investors make on hedge funds are taxed to income rather than capital \u2013 so the British mainland could compete with offshore jurisdictions.</p> <p>\"I lobbied George Osborne when the Tories were in opposition. I have long felt that the British government loses jobs to tax havens by allowing the revenue to have these rather archaic rules,\" he said. At the time he lobbied Osborne, Fink was not a treasurer but had given more than \u00a31m to the party.</p> <p>As shadow chancellor Osborne resisted his arguments, he said, probably because of influence from Revenue and Customs. \"It's a case where the Revenue has been penny wise and pound foolish. I have never understood it but it is something that the Revenue has always been paranoid about.\"</p> <p>His words may well embarrass the chancellor as he strives to present the Tories as a party that no longer cuts taxes for the rich or is lobbied by its big donors.</p> <p>They come amid an intense national debate over tax and whether there is a moral obligation upon British individuals and businesses not to use offshore havens.</p> <p>Fink \u2013 who has been described as the godfather of the UK hedge fund industry and has now given more than \u00a32.6m to the Tories \u2013 holds directorships at three companies which have links to tax havens. ISAM Services (UK) Limited has a parent company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. A spokesperson for ISAM said this allows a number of international investors to invest in that company without being subject to a double tax charge from the UK and their own domicile.</p> <p>He is also a member of Earth Capital Partners LLP, an investment partnership which owns subsidiary asset management firms in Guernsey.</p> <p>In 2010, Fink was appointed director of Marex Group, which has subsidiaries in Gibraltar and Switzerland.</p> <p>He insists there is little choice for those involved in international investment \u2013 you must have an entity based somewhere such as the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>\"If you want to be a successful business and attract invisible earnings to the UK, you have to be based offshore.\"</p> <p>The widespread connections between peers \u2013 who cannot vote on tax laws but can participate in debate and lobby in Westminster \u2013 and companies established in offshore havens, whether for tax, administrative or operational purposes, seem to confirm Fink's claims that the practice is not seen as tainted by executives in large international corporations.</p> <p>One of the wealthiest people in the music industry, Lord Lloyd-Webber, also sits in the House of Lords as a Conservative peer. He is a director of Really Useful Group, which owns a firm called Ruby Limited, a company registered in the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>A spokesman for Lloyd-Webber said there were no tax benefits from the subsidiary, adding that it is now dormant. He added that Really Useful Group plans to dissolve the company.</p> <p>Lord Howard, the Conservative party leader before Cameron, is a non-executive director of Global Switch Limited, which has offshore subsidiaries in the Isle of Man, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands. Howard insists the company pays \"all the taxes we are obliged to pay\".</p> <p>\"Global Switch Ltd does not carry out activities in its non-UK subsidiaries and all of the revenues associated with Global Switch Ltd are taxed entirely in accordance with UK legislation.\" Howard added: \"I have no involvement in those [offshore] subsidiaries and as far as I am aware they are all dormant.\"</p> <p>Lord Chadlington, the Tory lobbyist, donor and David Cameron's constituency chairman, is also chief executive of Huntsworth, the public relations group. The company has subsidiaries in Switzerland, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>A company spokesman said it has 210 subsidiaries, of which eight are in the identified jurisdictions.</p> <p>\"Huntsworth's UK tax bill has not been any lower because of the existence of these companies, which were for the most part acquired to allow Huntsworth to expand its business overseas. To suggest that Huntsworth has links with tax havens is clearly misleading in light of this explanation.\"</p> <p>Senior Labour MPs have expressed dismay that Labour peers are linked to companies established in tax havens. Lord Carter of Coles, the former chairman of Sport England, has a directorship at the Bermuda-registered Primary Group Ltd, a private-equity investment company. He did not respond to calls or emails.</p> <p>Lord Robertson, the former defence secretary and Nato secretary general, is a non-executive director of the Glasgow-based engineering firm Weir Group, which has subsidiaries in the Bahamas and the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>He is also deputy chairman of the board of the Russian oil company TNK-BP, registered in the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>Robertson said that Weir's offshore subsidiaries are \"not used\". \"In the annual report you will see that Weir Group pays more in tax than British taxation demands. TNK-BP was registered before my time but it pays tax in full in the Russian Federation.\"</p> <p>Other elder statesmen with offshore links include Lord Razzall, a former Lib Dem trade and industry spokesman, who sits on the board of directors at a firm called Ardel Holdings. The company is based in Guernsey and offers services including tax mitigation for clients, promising that \"income can be rolled up tax free\".</p> <p>Ardel helps with tax mitigation through \"fiduciary structuring\" for businesses and individuals. It also helps non-domiciled UK residents exploit non-taxable offshore funds. Its website says: \"The benefits and flexibility delivered by offshore companies make them a highly attractive option for clients.\"</p> <p>Razzall said: \"As an adviser to the owner of Ardel Holdings for the last 25 years I have always been satisfied that the business does not engage in activities of the type criticised by George Osborne.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian investigation into peers and MPs who have directorships or a controlling interest in companies linked to tax havens began as an exercise to show how widespread the use of offshore jurisdictions has become in British business life.</p> <p>It soon became apparent that many Parliamentarians who are able to influence tax laws have taken up positions as directors and non executive directors in major companies with offshore links.</p> <p>There are 27 Tories - six of whom are MPs \u2013 17 Labour peers, three Lib Dem peers and another 21 are either crossbench or non-affiliated peers.</p> <p>Our inquiries began by examining the Parliamentary registers of members' and Lords' interests to identify companies where Parliamentarians are registered as directors or a non-executive directors.</p> <p>This information was then cross-referenced with accounts or other financial records to find out if the companies were registered, or had a parent company or subsidiary, in a jurisdiction known as a tax haven.</p> <p>While most tax experts agree that tax havens are characterised by secrecy and low taxes, few have attempted to identify them.</p> <p>Revenue and Customs does not provide a list of tax havens. For the purposes of the article, we have referred to a list of 34 jurisdictions identified for their secrecy and low tax compiled for Congress in the US in 2009.</p> <p>According to the document, \"offshore secrecy jurisdictions\" identified by the Internal Revenue Service include Bermuda, Gibraltar, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the British Virgin Islands, Switzerland and Luxembourg.</p> <p>However, being based in a tax havendoes not always mean a company is avoiding tax or hiding company information - even though the jurisdictions are closely associated with this.</p> <p>In the Guardian's research, every offshore company identified was included, regardless of how the tax regimes were being used or what benefits there may have been or if the companies are running a business in the jurisdiction.</p> <p>The Guardian tried to contact every politician or the company at which they hold a position for a right of reply - in many cases, we contacted both. Our inquiries began at the end of July and continued until Thursday night.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aktf5W6PQi7zdF9VQjFPN3hBQkhlTGt4TG5iN3JieVE\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p> <h2>NEW!

  "<p>Targeted by the corporate lawyers from&#xa0;a global food conglomerate, Swedish director Fredrik Gertten adopts a brilliant judo defence: recording the entire process in the course of this gripping \u2013 at times positively Orwellian \u2013 documentary. Dole Foods are duly cast as the villains&#xa0;of the piece, aided and abetted by dodgy PR firms, internet astroturfers and a supine US media content to run the company's press releases as fact.

  "<p>Some painters die penniless, their work unappreciated. So it seems only fair after her artwork attracted global attention that Cecilia Gim\u00e9nez make some money \u2013 even if she did make Jesus look like a very hairy monkey.</p> <p>The 80-year-old Spanish parishioner became a worldwide laughing stock earlier this year after her botched restoration of a 19-century fresco of Christ with a crown of thorns became an internet sensation. Millions were reduced to tears of laughter, even as some hailed it as a masterpiece in its own right.</p> <p>Crowds have since swarmed to Gim\u00e9nez's handiwork, paying the Sanctuary of Mercy Church in Borja, near Zaragoza, \u20ac4 (\u00a33) each to marvel or mock. And now Gim\u00e9nez wants a slice of the action.</p> <p>\"She just wants the church to conform to the law,\" said Enrique Trebolle, the lawyer hired by Gim\u00e9nez. \"If this means economic compensation she wants it to be for charitable purposes.\"</p> <p>Trebolle said that Gim\u00e9nez wanted her cut of the profits to help Muscular atrophy charities because her son suffers from the condition.</p> <p>Ecce Homo, or Behold the Man, by Spanish artist Elias Garcia Martinez had suffered years of deterioration due to moisture when Gim\u00e9nez decided to take her brush to it.</p> <p>The resulting image has variously been dubbed \"the worst restoration in history\", \"beast Jesus\", and \"a crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic\".</p> <p>As the image's popularity grew, helped by an online petition in support of Gim\u00e9nez's work, paying visitors have poured thousands of euros into church coffers.</p> <p>Budget airline Ryanair even got in on the act, laying on a special flight to Zaragoza airport.</p> <p>Gim\u00e9nez was said to be acting \"spontaneously and with good intentions\" when she attempted the restoration but soon realised \"that things had got out of hand\".</p> <p>The original artist's family have called for the image to be restored to its former glory and have threatened possible legal action against Gim\u00e9nez for \"destroying\" the work.</p>",
  "<p>It's not hard to catch echoes of the Liberal Democrat quandary in the historic streets of Cambridge, where the tourist throng is poised to give way to the returning students and Nick Clegg's party has been riding high.</p> <p>It runs the city council and has twice in a row seen its candidate elected as the local MP \u2013 currently Dr Julian Huppert, a bioscientist at Clare College. Can this hegemony survive the coalition?</p> <p>\"I've always voted Lib Dem. I often find in a discussion that what the Lib Dem person is saying is what I feel,\" says Jane Rabey, pushing granddaughter Rosie, two, in her buggy past Sidney Sussex, Oliver Cromwell's old college. \"But I'm very disappointed and I don't know who I'll vote for next time. They badly let the students down over tuition fees, which matters in a place like Cambridge. I feel Nick Clegg's been used by the Tories, who wouldn't be in power but for him.\"</p> <p>Huppert, 34, voted against the \u00a39,000-a-year tuition fees for which Clegg has now very publicly apologised before party activists set off for their Brighton conference. Will it help save Huppert's seat?</p> <p>Even Tories admit he's a good local MP \u2013 keen on science and civil liberties, independent-minded in the way Cambridge likes its parliamentary representatives, having elected equally donnish Labour and even Tory MPs (when most students voted at home, not college) in recent decades.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, high-IQ Cambridge council is quite efficient too, though the majority over Labour in the Guildhall now depends on the mayor's casting vote. Labour defectors may have re-defected, but traditional Lib Dem strengths \u2013 pavement politics and hard work \u2013 will save the party from annihilation, activists predict from Hull to Haringey, via Cambridge.</p> <p>\"The council seats we held here are those with the best councillors, we're very discriminating,\" confides one old Cambridge hand.</p> <p>On the pavement opposite Sidney Sussex, a Tory woman snaps: \"The coalition was never going to last.\"</p> <p>Ian Allen, ex-Labour, now Green, cheerfully reports Lib Dem chums defecting; Clegg supporters concede as much in towns all over Britain.</p> <p>One middle class Huppert-voting couple exemplify the dilemma: she's already decided to abstain at the 2015 election, he's going to wait and see. These are tough times, and in Brighton many activists will be looking for a coalition exit strategy, with or without Clegg as deputy PM and party leader.</p> <p>Even loyalists ask privately: \"At what point does the party say Nick should not fight the election as our leader?\" and \"Could Nick ever cut a deal with Ed Miliband?\"</p> <p>Some immediately answer: \"Nick's saving grace is the absence of an alternative.\" On this reckoning, Vince Cable is too old or insufficiently collegiate, Cumbrian MP Tim Farron offers style over substance (and is biding his time), while clever Steve Webb, the expert pensions minister, lacks box office appeal. Simon Hughes is too flighty and Chris Huhne, awaiting trial over those allegedly swapped penalty points, is a counter-factual footnote.</p> <p>So both strategy and personnel are far from cut and dried as the party haemorrhages votes, council seats and morale everywhere. Yet \"those of us who've stayed with the party locally are incredibly solid\", says Cambridge activist Spencer Hagard.</p> <p>Clegg has tested activist sentiment in a dozen town hall meetings over the summer months, including last week in Nottingham and Cambridge, where he took questions on local radio shows, gave a reception for activists and held a public Q&amp;A.</p> <p>\"It's his second visit this year and he's in his second wind. A lot of us were quite pleased,\" says Hagard.</p> <p>By general consent, Clegg knows how much he has become the lightning conductor for party discontent and has made a big effort both to listen and to improve his key messages, as well as press the flesh.</p> <p>\"What are the problems?\" and \"what do you suggest?\" he asks. Everyone tells him that they understand how important it was to address the shaky public finances inherited from Labour in 2010, but also that tuition fees remain his millstone: hence this week's apology \u2013 \"or semi-apology\" as Gareth Epps, ex-Reading councillor, ex-parliamentary candidate and self-styled \"coalition sceptic\", describes it to the Guardian.</p> <p>Many of Epps's criticisms, as a left-leaning social liberal who briefly ran Reading council with the Tories before Labour re-took it, find echoes elsewhere.</p> <p>Ayoub Khan, who lost his Aston seat on Birmingham council in the May elections (but hopes to be the party's nominee for West Midlands police commissioner), is still cross that muddled policy messages from party HQ cost good councillors their seats, and that the tuition fees hike has discouraged poorer students.</p> <p>\"Nick's apology?\" he says. \"I think people are desensitised to apologies. We are being thrown out as a party which said one thing and did another.\"</p> <p>But Khan also embraces the core Lib Dem conviction that \"sheer hard work on the doorstep\" will save the grassroots party, as so often in the past.</p> <p>That is a view not shared by Liverpool city councillor Steve Radford, who fought on (and won) as a Liberal after refusing to join the 1988 merger with the SDP, let alone a coalition with David Cameron \u2013 the culmination of \"naked opportunism\" which has seen Lib Dem strength decay on Merseyside, he says.</p> <p>Dawn Barnes, who fought Cameron in Witney in 2010 (she came second with 19% of the vote to his 59%), is more typically upbeat, like most survivors of the coalition storm.</p> <p>Her local Lib Dem MP in Haringey, Lynne Featherstone, is popular, more so than the Labour council. More money has been directed towards poorer schools on the borough's eastern flank.</p> <p>Clegg's position and the achievements of Lib Dem priorities \u2013 like education \u2013 are beginning to get through to voters. \"If anything, we are picking up because we are having to work so much harder, says Barnes.</p> <p>Activists heading for Brighton predict a disappointing week for media prophets of splits and dissent, and unpopularity for noisy splitters.</p> <p>Dislike of Labour (\"what a reactionary party it still is\") remains strong and Lib Dem attitudes towards both bigger parties are coolly pragmatic.</p> <p>On Sidney Street in Cambridge, an immaculately dressed man, old enough to have voted for Jo Grimond in the 1960s, stiffly informs the Guardian: \"I am a Lib Dem voter and that is all I wish to communicate.\" He pauses before adding: \"I expect I will continue to support them.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was a good idea to apologise before his conference. On the eve of the 2010 election Nick Clegg's party political broadcast featured <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLR8R9JXz4\" title=\"\">Westminster bridge papered in other parties' broken promises</a> blowing in the wind. No wonder people felt cheated. It was not just students who felt he had stolen their votes in that brief Cleggmania moment when he vowed a \"cleaner\" politics and no more untruth.</p> <p>So will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nick-clegg-apologies-tuition-fees-pledge\" title=\"\">saying sorry</a> work? It can do no&#xa0;harm, as he can hardly sink lower in the polls. With some effrontery, the Tories now say they fear his \"toxic\" reputation damages Cameron's image when they sit together in the Commons. Yet Cameron's score of broken pre-election pledges \u2013 including the NHS, child benefit and frontline cuts \u2013 were deliberate deceptions on a quite unprecedented scale. Politics may never be altogether honest, so was it Clegg's whiter than white sanctimoniousness that now demands an apology?</p> <p>In this \"sorry\" moment Clegg could \u2013 just possibly \u2013 have seized the high ground. But it would have required real bravery. If he had spoken bluntly with a&#xa0;brutal new honesty, if he were willing to tell difficult, complicated truths, then&#xa0;he would have commanded more&#xa0;attention than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2012/sep/20/nick-clegg-apology-video-parodies\" title=\"\">YouTube spoofs</a>. If only he would stop saying things he knows are not true and start to talk about why things have not worked out as he hoped, then people might listen. He could have spoken frankly about the failing state of the economy, how it happened, why the Osborne remedies don't seem to work, why the bottom half are hit harder than the better off \u2013 and what he's going to do from now on.</p> <p>Here was a chance to break with the platitudinous mantras of political-speak. For a man of greater political imagination, this was the time to try a political experiment in authentic truth-telling. It might not work, the public might see it as weakness, but he had nothing to lose. Talking turkey would have turned this weekend's conference into a serious examination of his party's dilemma.</p> <p>Instead his \"sorry\" video ended with a string of the same weary non-truths, exaggerations and political boasting that make politicians so detested. \"We are fighting for the right things, day in and day out: rebuilding our economy to make it strong, changing the tax system to make it fair, defending the vulnerable in these tough times.\" These three short phrases each fly in the face of what's happening \u2013 and everyone knows it.</p> <p>Why claim to be \"rebuilding\" a strong economy when every week new figures emerge to show his coalition will break its commitment to make the deficit fall by 2015, while the price of failure adds more to national debt than Labour did in 13 years? The thinktank IPPR warns that on top of an already unallocated \u00a310bn of extra cuts, another \u00a314bn of cuts are on the way. Gemma Tetlow, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, shows how much austerity still lies ahead. Of cuts already announced, 88% were still to come as of last April, and 67% will still be ahead of us next April. Many more jobs will go: the IfS says 77% of public service cuts will still be ahead of us in 2013.</p> <p>For its conference Clegg's party has produced a paper called \"What have the Liberal Democrats ever done for you?\" It is filled with similar boastful economising with the truth. It begins naturally with \"We are cleaning up Labour's mess\". How refreshing it would be if Clegg started to tell the more complicated story of the global crash and the necessary cost of saving the financial system. He should say out loud what everyone can see: the great austerity is failing here, as it is across Europe \u2013 it's time to go for investment, delaying cuts until growth is established.</p> <p>Take the second boast in his apology: \"changing the tax system to make it fair\". Cutting the top rate to 45% hasn't struck many as fair. Raising the tax threshold is less fair than it looks, as the poorest don't pay tax. <a href=\"http://www.gingerbread.org.uk/content/912/Universal-credit\" title=\"\">Gingerbread</a>'s figures this week show how, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/10/universal-credit-benefits-disaster\" title=\"\">universal credit</a> comes in next year, middle and higher earners will gain more due to its tapers, but some 4 million working people will gain little. While Lib Dems boast of raising tax thresholds, they made no protest at George Osborne breaking his promise to uphold the value of child tax credits that help the hardest-pressed most. But then Lib Dem policies never did target the poor.</p> <p>That is why Clegg's third boast is as hollow as the other two. He has not been \"defending the vulnerable in these tough times\". Surely he cannot even pretend it to himself. The savage \u00a318bn benefit cuts include the sleight-of-hand switching of inflation from the retail to the consumer price index, so benefits will fall another 10% behind every decade, for ever, for those in and out of work, for the sick and children who are hit the hardest. Nearly 60% of benefit cuts will still lie ahead next April; child benefit will be means tested; evictions have begun due to housing benefit cuts; and big disability cuts are still to come. Lib Dem councillors must decide what to do about council tax benefit cuts that will charge hundreds of pounds to poor families who never paid it before. If at the Lib Dem conference Clegg again boasts of his pupil premium, an Ofsted report now confirms Sutton Trust and Barnardo's critical findings: this un-ring-fenced money, skimmed off the schools budget, is too seldom used for intensive help for children who need it.</p> <p>Ahead lie Osborne's new threats to cut public sector pay in regions whose economies are already falling sharply behind: Lib Dems in the south-west, where the NHS is embarking on regional pay plans, are calling for them to be jettisoned at the conference. Will they stop Osborne breaking the inflation indexing of all benefits? Boasting about making hard decisions is only the cowardice of the bully when all this toughness falls on the weak, not those with political clout.</p> <p>If Clegg had seized this chance for ground-breaking honesty, he might just have saved his skin. Few unelectable leaders ever depart of their own volition: if he fails to do a Captain Oates, surely his party will push him out to avoid mass slaughter of their MPs at the next election. It takes 75 local constituency parties to trigger a leadership election: they would be wise to summon Vince Cable to save as many seats as possible before 2015. But to make a difference, that clean break will require recantations and some honest talk from a new leader. Time for no more empty assaults on Labour, when the Lib Dems may join them in coalition before long.</p> <p><em>Dogma and Disarray \u2013 Cameron at Half-Time, by Polly Toynbee and David Walker, is available from guardianbookshop.co.uk</em></p>",

Some of it's organic. We also have a Trader Joe's which has inexpensive frozen chicken and fish. We (my son, daughter and I) have in the past two or three years had to make monthly or bimonthly trips to the food bank. My children are adults and don't have jobs. My son has spina bifida and gets SSI, but no food stamps. I have started growing lettuce and swiss chard which is pretty easy. We also have blackberry bushes by our apartments which I have been picking and freezing.</p> <p>Also, I began making my own laundry detergent out of Borax, washing soda and Ivory soap, which is very inexpensive and smells great. I also make dishwashing soap last longer with water, vinegar and washing soda.</p> <h2>Rose, Dublin, California<br>Weekly household grocery bill: $85</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-405782054\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/17/1305645879944/blueavatar-001.jpg\" alt=\"blueavatar\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">blueavatar Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I always shop according to what is on sale, which dictates what we will eat that week.

I add spuds and honey in season all direct from the producers at wholesale price. There are now around 80 very happy members and two farmers and it's growing all the time.

  "<p>Manufacturers expect to boost production over the next three months, but the outlook for high street stores remains grim for the rest of the year, according to figures released on Thursday.</p> <p>As central banks on both sides of the Atlantic continue to prop up demand amid concerns about a prolonged recession in the eurozone and falling global output, UK manufacturers told the CBI they believed business would improve in the run up to Christmas.</p> <p>More than a quarter of manufacturers (28%) expected to increase production over the next quarter, while 21% expect output to fall. The positive balance of 7% was better than August, when as many respondents expected output to fall as to rise.</p> <p>Manufacturers were also less pessimistic over their order books, though the balance reporting an improvement was still negative at -8%, against -21% in August.</p> <p>For retailers, the Office for National Statistics said the Olympics discouraged shoppers from buying online as they switched to the high street. But the revived enthusiasm for the shops failed to lift sales volumes in August, which fell 0.2% on July.</p> <p>The high street benefited from a mini surge in the sale of sporting goods and toys, much of it related to the Mo Farah effect and the success of Team GB, combined with shirt sales ahead of the start of the football season.</p> <p>The ONS said a 2.7% rise in overall sales since August 2011 had failed to significantly alter the picture for a sector that has flatlined over the last couple of years.</p> <p>Nevertheless, retail sales were still up 0.6% in the three months to August compared to the three months to May, which reinforces the view of many economists that the third-quarter GDP figures will show a rise after three quarters of falls.</p> <p>David Tinsley, UK economist at the investment bank BNP Paribas, said the decline in retail sales was disappointing, but \"with the Olympics distracting shoppers over that month, the fall could, on balance, have been much worse\".</p> <p>Food sales saw an increase, along with clothing and footwear, which saw sales rise 1.6%. But this was offset by a 2.7% fall in household goods sales and a 6.7% drop in internet purchases.</p>",
  "<p>Pressure to make dramatic changes to the Grand National has been resisted by the British Horseracing Authority, who announced only measured tweaks to next year's race including the trimming of the race distance. But despite offering a lukewarm welcome to some of the alterations to be introduced, the RSPCA has reiterated its call for further changes to the race, including a reduction in the number of runners and the removal of the famous Becher's Brook fence.</p> <p>\"Given the number of fallers and failures to complete the course, we do not accept that the field should remain at 40,\" said a statement from the organisation. \"Clearly many horses compete at the Grand National that cannot complete it.\"</p> <p>The organisation also described next year's race as being \"the BHA's last chance to show that this fence [Becher's Brook] can pose a fair and safe challenge to horse and jockey\".</p> <p>Both the BHA chief executive, Paul Bittar, and new Aintree managing director, John Baker, had attended a meeting with the RSPCA chief executive, Gavin Grant, 24 hours earlier at Sandown, a gathering which both parties welcomed as an opportunity to exchange views.</p> <p>\"We've always had a working relationship with the RSPCA and World Horse Welfare and I think we're in a good place with each other,\" said Baker. \"Our meeting certainly wasn't confrontational \u2013 it was an opportunity for some open and constructive dialogue.</p> <p>\"I understand how they feel about things and we'll continue to talk but at the same time we need to preserve the things that make the Grand National unique. It is a delicate balance.\"</p> <p>That view was shared by Tony McCoy, whose mount Synchronised was one of the two horses killed in this year's race.</p> <p>\"If we keep making changes, we will lose the uniqueness of the race,\" argued McCoy, who said he understood the decision to change the distance of the race by moving the start away from the grandstands and 90 yards closer to the first fence, an alteration called for by the presenter Clare Balding as reported in the Guardian earlier this week.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day the National is different from every other horse race and that is what makes it special. But if there are changes to be made that can help, then you've got to give it a go. The start of the Grand National is like the start of no other race. Everyone goes a little bit deaf at the start,\" added the champion jockey.</p> <p>Baker said that a reduction in the maximum number of runners from 40 had been closely considered but was shelved on the basis of a lack of statistical support.</p> <p>\"Between 1993 and 1999, when the average field size was less than 40, there was no more than a proportional reduction in the number of fallers, and so we didn't feel that the evidence was sufficiently compelling,\" he said. \"We will continue to monitor the situation, though.\"</p> <p>The BHA regulation director, Jamie Stier, took a similar line of defence, saying: \"Everything we have set about doing is evidence-based. There is no evidence that [the deaths in this year's race] were in any way related to field size. Indeed, when According To Pete was fatally brought down, there were only 17 horses remaining in the race at that point. We are regarding what occurred this year as not a sufficient basis upon which to make further changes.\"</p> <p>The start is to be moved away from in front of the grandstands with the aim of producing a \"calmer and more controlled environment for both horse and rider,\" according to Stier. \"We recognise that there is pressure and tension before the race and we want to alleviate that where possible. It is possible that a more controlled environment at the start, along with reducing the distance between the start and the first fence, could have the effect of reducing the early speed of the race. If this were to be the case, it would be an added benefit.\"</p> <p>Minor changes to Becher's Brook, without altering the dimensions of the fence, have already been made since this year's race, while undulations in the landing areas at three other fences have also been levelled. Although no further changes will be made to the fences themselves, a three-year research programme into alternative fence designs is to begin and prototypes may be tested at the next meeting at Aintree in December.</p>",
  "<p>An air strike on a petrol station in northern Syria has killed more than 50 people, activists have claimed. The attack took place in Raqqa province, around 100 miles (160km) east of war-torn Aleppo.</p> <p>A video posted online, which purportedly showed the aftermath, revealed a scene of devastation as locals and emergency workers scrambled amid fire and wreckage. Activists claim the petrol station was attacked on Thursday afternoon by a jet fighter that had circled above it hours before.</p> <p>The Syrian air force has been increasingly active over much of the country's towns and cities in recent months, but had rarely attacked in Raqqa. The bombing took place in Ain Issa village, around 25 miles south of the Turkish border, close to where rebels on Wedesday over-ran a border checkpoint.</p> <p>Fighting continued in Syria's two biggest cities, with suburbs of Aleppo again seeing pitched battles between regime forces backed by heavy artillery in the west of the city and guerilla forces in the east. In the capital Damascus, regime forces continued to sweep through areas that had been deemed sympathetic to opposition groups.</p> <p>Residents said jets and helicopters were a constant presence over the south-east suburb of Douma, where rebels claimed earlier on Thursday to have shot down a helicopter that had been firing on sites below.</p> <p>Syria's information minister later acknowledged that one of its military helicopters had crashed, but claimed it had done so after a grazing a passenger jet mid-air, which had later landed safely.</p> <p>Frequent attacks from above on rebel positions, often in civilian neighbourhoods, have caused immense damage in Homs, Hama and Idlib as well, where air strikes have taken place most days since mid-July.</p> <p>Violence has intensified across the country since then, with almost all parts of Syria now engaged in civil war. Rebel gains in Aleppo and Damascus during days that followed have not yielded the decisive blows that opposition commanders had expected.</p> <p>Rather regime forces, which had initially been on the back foot, have clawed back losses of territory in Damascus and are inching forward in Aleppo, where the battle is being steadily joined by militants from outside Syria, some of whom espouse global jihadism.</p> <p>Syria's national news agency said 100 such Afghan fighters had been killed in Aleppo on Thursday, a claim strongly denied by rebel leaders on the ground. The arrival of foreigners to key battlefields has been a point of contention for the Free Syrian Army, whose units are sometimes cautiously welcoming the strangers.</p> <p>\"They are trying to form their own leadership groups,\" said one rebel officer in southern Turkey. \"We won't let that happen. This is our revolution. It is not a jihad as they see it.\"</p> <p>The International Committee for the Red Cross has renewed warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis as refugees continue to stream from Syria into neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan where local authorities are struggling to provide food and shelter for them.</p>",
  "<p>The boards of Xstrata and Glencore are scrambling to agree the terms of a \u00a356bn tie-up in the latest episode of the protracted merger talks between the mining company and the commodities trading&#xa0;house.</p> <p>With the clock ticking on the deadline set by the Takeover Panel for an announcement by Monday, the Xstrata board is trying to decide whether to recommend the terms of the proposal by Glencore \u2013 possibly as soon as Friday. If agreed, the deal would create a business that would be at the centre of the global trade in vital commodities such as wheat and sugar.</p> <p>If it is to succeed, much will hinge on the support of the Qatari investment fund that owns more than 12% of Xstrata and scuppered the first attempt at a deal by arguing that the price being paid by Glencore was too low. That led to a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/glencore-delay-xstrata-merger-vote\" title=\"\"> dramatic revision of the terms a fortnight ago</a> when Glencore raised its offer and altered the proposed management structure of the enlarged company.</p> <p>Instead of being run by Xstrata's chief executive Mick Davis \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/31/xstrata-chief-windfall\" title=\"\">who at one stage stood to receive \u00a330m in retention payments to keep him for three years</a> \u2013 the company would be led by Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg after six months.</p> <p>The management changes are thought to have been a concern for the investment fund of the gas-rich Gulf state of Qatar, which had demanded 3.25 Glencore shares for each Xstrata share it owned. The original offer, made in February, was for 2.85 shares, although this was raised to 3.05 shares this month \u2013 minutes before the two companies were due to hold shareholder meetings to vote on the tie-up.</p> <p>Also to be settled are any new retention packages for top Xstrata staff, who under the initial terms stood to share in share awards of more than \u00a3240m. Glencore has asked the Xstrata board to consider what changes are needed. The generosity had threatened a rebellion by City investors, who were being asked to vote separately on the payments to more than 70 staff.</p> <p>Xstrata has argued that the retention packages are needed because 80% of the combined group's income will come from the mining company in which Glencore already owns a 34% stake.</p> <p>When hitherto-secretive Glencore <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/18/glencore-ipo-price-london-flotation?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">floated in London last year</a> it was widely seen as the first step towards making a bid for Xstrata as well as a way of enriching its 485 partners.</p> <p>The retention packages would still need the approval of Xstrata shareholders. The merger is currently structured as scheme of arrangement, which requires approval from 75% of investors, though it can be turned into takeover \u2013 requiring 50% approval \u2013 if Xstrata and the Takeover Panel agree.</p>",
  "<p>John Swinney, the Scottish finance secretary, has offered hundreds of thousands of public sector workers a \"modest\" rise in pay for the first time in three years in his draft budget.</p> <p>Scottish trade unions said the 1% across the board wage increase, to come into effect next April, was too mean. They accused him of copying George Osborne's pay restraint policies \"almost to the letter\".</p> <p>With local councils offered no new money, the pay rise would mean other services would need to be cut.</p> <p>Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said UK government spending cuts had put Swinney in a very difficult position, leaving the Scottish government with the tightest budget in recent times \u2013 about \u00a328bn.</p> <p>Smith added: \"However, it is disappointing that Mr Swinney has followed George Osborne's public sector pay policy almost to the letter.</p> <p>\"A third year of significant real-terms wage cuts for hundreds of thousands of workers puts Mr Swinney's attempts at stimulus into perspective.\"</p> <p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said she was furious. She said the pay rise, which is less than inflation, was so slight it was effectively another freeze.</p> <p>It would, she said, hit morale again in the profession and increase teachers' resentment following repeated attacks on their pensions, conditions and pay.</p> <p>\"Teachers and other public servants are being made to foot the bill for the economic downturn at a time when their pensions are also being attacked and the cost of living is accelerating,\" Keates said.</p> <p>\"This budget will do little to alleviate this frustration and risks jeopardising the progress which has been made in recent years to raise educational standards and develop a world-class teaching profession.\"</p> <p>Swinney admitted that the 1% increase, which will exclude public employees earning over \u00a380,000 and see slightly higher rises for those on less than \u00a321,000, <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/09/draft-budget20092012\" title=\"\">would have to be funded from existing budgets for local councils and public sector bodies. </a></p> <p>Despite their frustration with the settlement, Scottish union leaders are unlikely to back proposals for the general strike suggested at the TUC annual conference earlier this month.</p> <p>Sources said the unions were more concerned about protecting jobs at this stage: Swinney again promised there would be no public sector compulsory redundancies despite the cuts.</p> <p>Swinney's draft budget for 2013/14 is the second year of a three-year spending plan. It has not deviated significantly from his original proposals but does include minor changes designed to improve economic growth.</p> <p>He said there would be \u00a340m in accelerated spending on affordable homes, \u00a317m more for colleges and student support, a \u00a315m fund to support 10,000 new jobs for young people \u2013 which needs match funding from European structural funds and employers \u2013 and \u00a380m in accelerated spending on new and refurbished schools.</p> <p>The total package was worth \u00a3180m but will be funded through cuts in other areas: the legal aid budget will be heavily affected, down from a peak of \u00a3220m in 2010 to \u00a3149m next year.</p> <p>Swinney has also taken \u00a345m away from publicly-owned utility Scottish Water and will allow it to raise water charges for the first time in several years. At present, Scottish consumers' water bills are on average \u00a352 lower than English people's.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Historic Scotland</a>, the ancient monuments agency, will get funding of \u00a344m \u2013 \u00a35m less than 2010. Its funding for 2014 will be cut further to \u00a335m. The Scottish Court Service funding will be cut from \u00a393m in 2010 to \u00a373m next year.</p> <p>Kevin Keenan, a councillor and the finance spokesman for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities \u2013 the umbrella body for 32 councils \u2013 said the sector faced continuing challenges and warned the heaviest impact would come once the UK government's welfare reforms hit fully in 2014.</p> <p>\"As part of the settlement discussions with government, we have highlighted that whilst 2013/14 will present challenges for us all, the 2014/15 settlement will require further talks between ourselves and government as the full extent of issues like welfare reform hit local government,\" he said.</p> <p>Dan Barlow, head of policy at the environment group WWF Scotland, said Swinney's green investments were too modest and limited to have a significant impact on climate and fuel poverty.</p> <p>Swinney was still focusing heavily on major road-building projects and spending too little on energy efficiency.</p> <p>\"Although there were warm words on cycling, the transport budget is still massively dominated by large road schemes,\" Barlow said.</p> <p>\"The balance of transport spend needs to shift very significantly in favour of active travel and public transport if we are to deliver a healthy and low-carbon transport system.\"</p>",
  "<p>The prospect of a synchronised recession across the global economy loomed larger on Thursday after news that China's factory output shrank for an 11th straight month, Europe's recession intensified and the manufacturing sector in the US had its weakest quarter in three years.</p> <p>Four years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the biggest slump since the 1930s, a range of gloomy data highlighted the struggle of policymakers to boost activity.</p> <p>Analysts said Europe's sovereign debt crisis, high commodity prices, the legacy of the financial collapse and tension between the world's three biggest economies had soured the economic environment since the start of 2012.</p> <p>Japan, involved in a territorial row with China over disputed islands, reported a drop in exports for a fourth month, leaving the country on course in 2012 to run a trade deficit for a second year. Meanwhile, a flash estimate of US industry in the third quarter from Markit showed that output has barely been rising over the summer. The purchasing managers index stood at 51.5 in September, down from 54.2 in June and the weakest since September 2009.</p> <p>\"Manufacturing isn't looking good,\" said David Sloan, economist at 4Cast in New York. \"The global situation is a restraint on the US economy.</p> <p>\"Certainly, there is not going to be much growth in Europe. Growth in Asia, and China in particular, is slowing down, so US growth is going to have to be domestically generated.\"</p> <p>Markit chief economist, Chris Williamson, said: \"With output growing at the slowest pace since the recovery began, the manufacturing sector may have even acted as a slight drag on the economy in the third quarter.\"</p> <p>A separate report from the US labour department showed initial claims for unemployment aid edged down only 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week.</p> <p>Economists had attributed a spike in claims in the prior week to hurricane Isaac, but the minimal improvement in the latest reading pointed to fundamental weakness and will add to the nervousness of Barack Obama's team in the remaining weeks of the US presidential election campaign.</p> <p>With jobs and growth seen as vital by both Democrats and Republicans in the race for the White House, the four-week moving average for new claims rose 2,000 to 377,750 \u2013 the highest level since June and the fifth consecutive weekly increase.</p> <p>Pressure is also mounting on Beijing for a fresh economic stimulus after the broad-based weakening in global demand continued to dampen export demand from China's factories, and left the economy on course in 2012 to post its first sub-8% growth since 1999. Despite an easing of credit conditions and higher spending on infrastructure spending, analysts warned there was little sign of an end to the slowdown in the world's second biggest economy. \"We are now approaching the one-year anniversary of this index dropping below 50 and a recovery is still not in sight,\" said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics.</p> <p>The flash estimate of manufacturing from HSBC/Markit showed the purchasing managers' index at 47.8, little changed from the 47.6 recorded in August and below the cut off point of 50 that separates a contracting from expanding sector.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a European commission report showed eurozone consumer confidence falling for the fourth consecutive month in September to a 40-month low amid signs that activity across the 17-nation single currency zone is heading for a second quarter of decline, meeting the technical definition of recession. Markit's composite PMI for the eurozone dropped from 46.3 to 45.9 in September, its lowest level in three years.</p> <p>Analysts were particularly worried about the big fall recorded in France, seeing it as confirmation that even Europe's biggest economies were not immune from the knock-on effects of the debt crisis. Although Germany put in a stronger than expected performance, financial markets are braced for official growth figures to show that the eurozone contracted by 0.3-0.4% in the third quarter. The EC's consumer confidence index sank to -25.9 in September from -24.6 in August, while Ireland reported that gross domestic product was flat in the second quarter owing to falling consumer spending and much lower investment spending.</p> <p>Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said: \"Today's PMI figures confirm that the Eurozone economy as a whole remains stuck in recession, despite the tentative signs of stabilisation in Germany. We can only hope that the improved sentiment on financial markets in the wake of the latest actions by the central banks will spill over to the real economy \u2013 not just in Germany \u2013 and help foster a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter. But with the fiscal squeeze across the region intensifying, we cannot rely on it. Indeed, further macroeconomic stimulus \u2013 including a weaker euro and an ECB rate cut \u2013 is likely to be needed to put the region on a path of sustained growth and hence ensure the survival of EMU.\"</p>",
  "<p>The power of sport for social good is well recognised and when harnessed in the right way, can have a hugely positive impact on development goals including improving health, education and community cohesion.

  "<p>The meeting took place on Monday last week in building 101 on the main road just outside the town of Gereshk. At one end of a long table was an oversized portrait of Hamid Karzai, and sitting opposite it was Saleem Rodi, the quietly spoken district governor. Rodi was chairing this gathering, huddled around him were the most senior security officials in the area \u2013 Afghan and British \u2013 and they were in conspiratorial mood.</p> <p>The subject was the insurgency, their aim was surprise, and their plans had a name: Operation Qalb (Heart).</p> <p>Rodi said only the people in the room knew the details of the forthcoming attack, and secrecy was paramount if the Taliban were to be caught unawares; other missions had been hindered by leaks. He wanted to hear from everyone around the table about how civilian casualties could be minimised if and when the shooting started. \"We have sacrificed a lot of blood already,\" he said.</p> <p>Helmand province has been the fiercest battleground in Nato's fight with the Taliban over the last 11 years, and its central district of Nahr-e Saraj has become the most violent area within it. There is no place quite like it.</p> <p>Eighteen British soldiers have died there since the beginning of the year, nine in the last 10 weeks. Afghan soldiers have perished in even greater numbers, 25 since April. Hours before this security meeting, a government official was assassinated less than a mile away.</p> <p>The violence here has polarised opinions about the state of the country. No other place in Afghanistan better reflects the competing views about the future \u2013 the claims and counter claims about what can and cannot be achieved in the two years before combat troops from Nato's International Security and Assistance Force (Isaf) leave Afghanistan for good. This urgency prompted British and Afghan commanders to undertake another big heave during this summer's fighting season, co-ordinating three major operations in an attempt to drive the insurgents into sparsely populated desert areas where, it is hoped, they will struggle to mount meaningful attacks against the main towns.</p> <p>Two of these assignments have been in Nahr-e Saraj, where Afghan and British troops have pushed into badlands that have been a haven for the Taliban for nearly 20 years, and even longer for the narco-gangs they are often aligned with.</p> <p>British commanders say this is the main reason why casualties have been so high: because the fight is being taken to the insurgents, not the other way around.</p> <p>But despite having overwhelming military superiority, these gains are gradual and sometimes come at a terrible cost. Whether the areas can be held in the long term is a question nobody can answer.</p> <p>One British officer involved in both operations in Nahr-e Saraj conceded he was surprised by the insurgents' resilience. \"I am constantly amazed by them,\" he said. \"They are completely over-matched by us and the Afghan army. We keep killing them, but they keep coming back for more.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396450359\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/20/1348151896258/Afghanistan-map-of-Nahr-e-001.png\" alt=\"Afghanistan map of Nahr-e Saraj\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nahr-e Saraj, a haven for the Taliban for nearly 20 years. Credit: Guardian graphics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unable to fight face to face, the insurgents have been attempting to derail the clearance strategy with a mix of roadside bombs and sniper fire. But another tactic has proved much more successful. Their ability to \"turn\" members of the Afghan security forces to attack Isaf soldiers prompted Nato's hasty decision to reduce some joint patrols with Afghan troops. The so-called green on blue killings have not all been engineered by the insurgents, but they now know how to hurt the western alliance \u2013 and will try harder.</p> <p>For the British, one of the main aims of Operation Qalb is to reinforce security around Gereshk, the busy town that accounts for more than half of the people in Nahr-e Saraj. Having driven the insurgents out of Gereshk, street by street, building by building, this is one of the military's showpiece legacies.</p> <p>The bazaar here used to look like a bomb had hit it, or several probably. Now that it is vibrant and comparatively calm, business has begun to take root. In the last two years, 500 shops have been built in the town, and all have been bought.</p> <p>Talking to Afghans who live there, it is obvious they are grateful for being in the security bubble. They also admit feeling apprehensive about what will happen when Isaf leaves.</p> <p>Bahlool Khan, who has just been re-elected as chair of the Gereshk local council, said: \"In the past there was a lot of fighting. There was a lot of bloodshed and people were killing each other. There was no education, no health. People were hiding behind walls. Nobody trusts the insurgents. People have not forgotten.\"</p> <p>One woman living in Gereshk added: \"The women living here are quite happy to have Isaf around. The girls are going to school again. We don't want the old tribal wars to come back. It has become more peaceful, especially in the bazaar. We don't want to go back to the Taliban days when Isaf goes.\"</p> <p>The best way to protect them, Afghan and Nato commanders have decided, is to push the insurgents further away from the town, deeper into Helmand.</p> <p>The Afghan army has taken the lead in the two most recent operations, supported by Danish and British forces, including the Grenadier Guards, who are stationed at Main Operating Base Price, a short drive from Gereshk.</p> <p>The tactic is simple, but requires feats of co-ordination to get right.</p> <p>On Monday and Tuesday nights last week, 1,200 Afghan troops from the 3rd Kandak (battalion), along with 200 British soldiers and advisers, left their neighbouring camps to take up discreet positions in the insurgent-filled region of Pulpazay.Forming a steel ring around villages and compounds, the Afghan National Army (ANA) began a series of house to house searches, gradually sweeping its way through the area, flushing out insurgents. Commanders who have been on previous operations say few insurgents stand and fight, and those who try do not come out alive.</p> <p>The ones who run are caught in the net around the village and are handed over to the police. All the details of this latest operation have not been disclosed yet because it is not over. But the early days of the mission suggest at least some success. Forty-four improvised explosive devices were discovered, as well as \"a significant weapons cache, radio equipment and hundreds of rounds of ammunition\".</p> <p>It will be another week before this mission finishes, by which time the ANA hopes to have built permanent checkpoints to deter the insurgents from coming back again. Locally elected councillors have been preaching there too, offering modest gestures \u2013 such as repairing a roof or well \u2013 to help persuade those who might be sceptical about whether their \"liberation\" will last, or do them any good.</p> <p>The facts that the ANA is taking the lead in these exercises and that Nahr-e Saraj has elected officials are regarded by the British as a measure of the progress that has been made in this district over the last three years. But can the Afghan army, which has basic equipment and is still evolving as a fighting force, continue to protect the safer areas, let alone take on the insurgents in places where the Taliban appear to remain strong?</p> <p>British commanders believe they can do the former but are more hesitant about the latter. \"Last year there was violence inside populated areas; this year, the violence is still at the same level, but it has been displaced,\" said Brigadier Doug Chalmers, commander of Task Force Helmand.</p> <p>\"Everyone talks about Nahr-e Saraj as if it is toxic. There is a northern part of the district that has a lot of insurgency activity inside rural villages. But the actual city of Gereshk is growing. It is not a city under siege, otherwise it would be withering. Gereshk gives me confidence we are providing the environment for the Afghans to regain a bit of control.</p> <p>\"If people weren't bothering to invest, I would be nervous that what we are doing here might be a bit transitory. But if you go there, it is a bustling regional town. How much better could it be? External investors are oblivious to the violence.\"</p> <p>There are big caveats, as Chalmers acknowledges. \"Is it going to continue to move forward? I think it will, but I can't guarantee that it will. Will there be the same level of change that we have seen over the last two years? The answer is, I am not sure there will be. The Afghans will do things differently, and as they take responsibility, it will change the dynamic in a way that we don't really know yet.\"</p> <p>Chalmers said it may be more important to the Afghan security forces to hold what they already have. \"The fact that there may still be an insurgency when we have gone, is that going to affect the city of Gereshk, or will Afghans be prepared to tolerate that? My feeling is that they are slightly more pragmatic than the west. They know what matters.\"</p> <p>The local security forces were already reaching out to the insurgents, he said, and local accommodations and agreements could follow. This could lead to deals that leave the Afghan government in control of some areas, and the Taliban free to live in others.</p> <p>That is not what the UK had once hoped for, but it might be Helmand's best hope now. \"Our job is to enable the Afghans to enter the conversation from a position of strength,\" said Chalmers. \"It is very difficult to have those conversations with people if you are the weakling in the room. And it is very difficult for us as genuine outsiders to do that level of negotiation. A lot of it is quite local, village to village. It is very difficult for us to do, and I don't think it is right for us to do.\"</p> <p>Chalmers admitted anxiety about relinquishing all control to the Afghans, as Nato is gradually doing as part of its withdrawal strategy. He likened it to a parent watching a child going to university, and becoming truly independent. \"I have to force myself to accept that the only way for this to work is to let go.\"</p> <p>General Adrian Bradshaw, commander of British forces in Afghanistan, and deputy to Isaf 's commander, General John Allen,said the high levels of violence this year in places such as Nahr-e Saraj were symptomatic of something else. He believes the Taliban are pushing back as hard as they can because their leaders are preparing to enter the political and reconciliation process.</p> <p>\"What we would expect from an insurgency entering the political arena is to seek to maximise the bargaining position. It is often suggested that the Taliban will simply wait us out until 2015 and scale down their effort, and what we are seeing now does not represent the maximum effort. I don't think that is credible at all.</p> <p>\"What they will be doing now, and what they have been doing all of this summer, is absolutely maximising their effort to full capacity because they have to maximise their bargaining position when entering the negotiating arena. All the indications we get from intelligence suggest there is a real push on their junior commanders, from their senior commanders sitting outside the country, to keep up the fight.\"</p> <p>Bradshaw said he believed the Taliban had been struggling with funding because they made no money out of opium poppies last year. The insurgents were also short of weapons, he added. \"[They] are now coming to the realisation that keeping on and keeping on, pounding themselves against us and our Afghan partners, is not delivering. This is the beginning of an understanding by their higher command that they have to find an alternative approach. And there are signs that some of them are looking to do just that. We are seeing it to a certain degree at all levels. We see signs from mid-level fighters of dissatisfaction.</p> <p>\"Some of them leave the organisation and weare aware that at higher level there also people interested in a political path, or at least concluding that they will not achieve their political ends by military means alone.\" However, Bradshaw admitted it would be wrong to suggest the insurgency was in any way spent. \"I don't want to paint too rosy a picture of the situation. The fact remains that the insurgency is still a significant threat to peace and stability.\"</p> <p>And nowhere more so than in Nahr-e Saraj. The area has always been a hotbed of tribal and gang rivalry, quite separate from the insurgency. The assassination of a government official in the district last week was not claimed by the Taliban. That kind of murder is not uncommon in Helmand; such attacks happened before UK troops arrived, and they will continue once they have gone. British commanders accept that and understand better than perhaps ever before that their forces have probably done as much as they can, or were ever likely to be able to do, in a society as complex and feudal as Afghanistan. Now it is up to the Afghans themselves.</p> <p>One of the men who will have most responsibility for the security of Nahr-e Saraj in the coming years is Colonel Hamayoon, the 36-year-old commander of the ANA's 3rd Kandak. The officer has been working with the British over the last two years, and says he has learned a great deal from them. Like all commanders in every military, he wants better equipment and more of it. But there is a greater need: he wants to go it alone, without Isaf.</p> <p>\"This is our country and our people, and it is our obligation to take responsibility for their safety. There will be peace. The only question is when.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> You wait two years for something and it's over in three days. Enough about your latest doomed relationship; I'm referring to Zimbabwe's World T20 campaign. <strike> If </strike> When they lose today they will exit the tournament before most teams have played their first game. Mind you, Zimbabwe did beat South Africa the last time these two sides met in a global tournament \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/65218.html\">a match those with English cricket close to their heart/funnybone will remember well</a>. Zimbabwe could win today, but <a href=\"http://www.oddschecker.com/cricket/international/twenty20-world-cup/south-africa-v-zimbabwe/winner\">South Africa's odds of 1/20 </a>look about right.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss</strong> and will bowl first.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Levi, Amla, Kallis, de Villiers (c/wk), Duminy, Behardien, A Morkel, Botha, Peterson, Steyn, M Morkel.</p> <p><strong>Zimbabwe</strong> Masakadza, Sibanda, Taylor (c/wk), Ervine, Matsikenyeri, Chigumbura, Cremer, Utseya, Price, Mpofu, Vitori.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>1st over: Zimbabwe 1-0 (Masakadza 1, Sibanda 0)</strong> The ground is almost empty. It's a bit eerie, especially with cheesy beatdisco nonsense pumping out as the openers walk to the wicket. Hamilton Masakadza offers no stroke to the first four balls of the match, from Dale Steyn, and then steals a single to extra cover. Vusi Sibanda also leaves his first delivery. There can't be too many T20 overs in which five of the six balls were ignored by the batsmen.</p> <p>\"Seeing as how SA have won the toss and will bowl, what are the odds on the match being over before I have to go out at 4.45pm?\" says Clare Davies. \"I'm thinking it's possible but maybe I am being unkind to Zimbabwe.\" It shouldn't be over <em>that</em> quickly, although it may be finished in time for Pointless.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 2-1 (Sibanda b M Morkel 0)</strong> Well that didn't take long. Morne Morkel castles Vusi Sibanda for nought with a fine delivery: full and seaming back through the gate to trim the bails as Sibanda went for a big drive.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Zimbabwe 3-1 (Masakadza 2, Taylor 1)</strong> The new batsman is the captain Brendan Taylor, who avoids a tournament king pair after his first-baller the other night. There is good carry in this pitch, especially for an Asian wicket, and Masakadza is beaten on the pull to conclude the over.</p> <p>\"Hi Rob, I am out here,\" says Louwrens Botha. \"I've never heard of Behardien but the fact that Faf du Plessis is finally out of the team fills me with confidence. Not much faith in Levi though, I think it's the regular giants (Kallis, Amla and AB) who'll have to produce for SA today and throughout the tournament.\" Albie Morkel gives them good depth at No7, but there are some potential weak links in the top six for sure.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Zimbabwe 4-1 (Masakadza 2, Taylor 2)</strong> Masakadza misses a windy woof at a lovely outswinger from Dale Steyn. This may be a straightforward game for South Africa, in theory, but Dale Steyn has his gameface on. And wise men don't argue with Dale Steyn's gameface. Masakadza is beaten again by some extra bounce later in the over. Zimbabwe are rattling along at 1.33 runs per over; their projected 20-over score is 27.</p> <p>\"Afternoon Smyth, afternoon everybody,\" says Josh Robinson. \"If you're short on emails, you might like to check your spam folder. That must be where mine are ending up, because I'm unable to think of any other plausible explanation why you would have neglected to publish them.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 6-2 (Taylor c de Villiers b M Morkel 4)</strong> Two wickets in two overs for Morne Morkel. This time he takes the key wicket of the captain Brendan Taylor. It was an ugly dismissal. Taylor reached with a horizontal bat for a very wide delivery that took the bottom edge on its way through to AB de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: Zimbabwe 11-2 (Masakadza 6, Ervine 1)</strong> A boundary! Masakadza blasts a full delivery from Morkel down the ground for the first four of the innings.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 16-3 (Masakadza c Levi b A Morkel 6)</strong> Albie Morkel strikes with his fourth ball. Masakadza, charging down the track with all the conviction of Blackadder going over the top, lifted Morkel high in the air to mid on. This is far too easy for South Africa.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: Zimbabwe 17-3 (Ervine 6, Matsikenyeri 0)</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>mismatch [\u02ccm\u026as\u02c8m\u00e6t\u0283]</strong><br><em>vb</em> to match badly, esp in marriage<br><em>n</em> a bad or inappropriate match</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: Zimbabwe 21-3 (Ervine 8, Matsikenyeri 2)</strong> Four singles from Morne Morkel's third over.</p> <p>\"We have bigger crowds watching warm-ups on the maidan where I live here in a village in the Himalayas,\" says Prakash Anand. \"What happens if Sri Lanka don't make the semi-finals? Will this be the most underattended 'world' sporting tournament ever?\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: Zimbabwe 26-3 (Ervine 11, Matsikenyeri 4)</strong> The offspinner Johan Botha comes into the attack; his first over yields five. Zimbabwe are regrouping solidly, and if they keep wickets in hand for overs 41-50 they could post a competitive score.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: Zimbabwe 34-3 (Ervine 16, Matsikenyeri 7)</strong> Craig Ervine gets his second boundary with an excellent reverse sweep off the new bowler Robin Peterson. Ervine has played nicely so far.</p> <p>\"I don't understand the format (but then again I don't understand much),\" says Charles Evison. \"How come Zimbabwe is playing their second game and are in danger of being dumped out the tournament before England have even played a game?\" It's unavoidable if you have groups of three, because the second match in each group will always involve one side playing their second game and one side playing their first game, so when the second game in Group A is played, one team in Groups B, C and D won't have played their first game. Confused? Splendid, now lie down on the couch and talk to me about Oedipus.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9th over: Zimbabwe 43-3 (Ervine 21, Matsikenyeri 9)</strong> Another fine stroke from Ervine, an inside-out drive to the cover boundary off Botha. Two balls later Matsikenyeri is hit on the pad by an almost yorker-length delivery and survives a huge LBW appeal. I suspect it was turning down the leg side. Nine from the over. This has been a good, purposeful partnership.</p> <p>\"I am so disheartened that this contest (debatable description!) is already over that I may consider bidding on one of those awful specially minted ICC coins they use for the toss...\" says Jim Lewis. \"The minnows have been slightly disappointing so far, particularly their fielding, although I have a sneaky feeling England will make Afghanistan look like world beaters tomorrow.\" If they find a way to play Finn and Broad \u2013 which is a huge if, I realise \u2013 they could win that game.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10th over: Zimbabwe 51-3 (Ervine 25, Matsikenyeri 11)</strong> <br>\"Today may be a m\u026as\u02c8m\u00e6t\u0283, but I have hope for the future,\" says Patrick Kingsley. \"In the latest version of International Cricket Captain, now thankfully available for Mac, the year is 2033, I am the captain of Zimbabwe, and we are number one in all three formats of the game. We've won every single World Cup and World T20 for the past 20 years. Our secret weapon? <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/player/235524.html\">Timycen Maruma</a>, who is Zim's record wicket-taker in my alternative universe. Sadly he's not in the real-life squad. But maybe he should be.\"</p> <p>One good thing about playing management games into the 2030s is that you sometimes get made-up names based on a mix of current player names. I wouldn't fancy coming up against Sir Garfield Botham or Malcolm Holding, although I suppose I'd fancy my chances against Chris Salisbury and Patterson Mahmood.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 51-4 (Matsinkenyeri c Peterson b Kallis 11)</strong> Jacques Kallis takes his 47410895th international wicket in his first over. Matsikenyeri, on the walk, clobbered a short ball straight to Peterson at extra cover.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 51-5 (Chigumbura LBW b Kallis 0)</strong> Make that 47410896 international wickets. Kallis has struck with consecutive deliveries. Elton Chigumbura got in a terrible mess with a very full delivery that hit him right in front of middle. A blindfolder man could have given that out, and Kallis on a hat-trick.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>11th over: Zimbabwe 51-5 (Ervine 25, Cremer 0)</strong> Cremer survives the hat-trick ball. Jacques Kallis has bog-standard Twenty20 figures: 1-1-0-2.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12th over: Zimbabwe 57-5 (Ervine 28, Cremer 3)</strong> Six from Albie Morkel's over. \"Afternoon Rob,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"I normally only come here for nostalgia, and this occasion is no different. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe/content/player/55528.html\">Remember Neil Johnson</a>? He was a beast and a genuine all-rounder as well as a part time wickie(?). His profile photo is hardly flattering but at least it was before the hair went. I definitely saw him play for a world XI at the Oval once, but it doesnt seem to be on Cricinfo.\" He was a fine player and made that lovely hundred against Australia at Lord's during the 1999 World Cup. Zimbabwe had a really good team around then, surely their best.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>13th over: Zimbabwe 58-5 (Ervine 28, Cremer 4)</strong> Steyn returns to the attack in pursuit of some free candy. Cremer survives an extremely tight run-out referral after being sent back by Ervine. Steyn concludes a lively over by dumping Ervine on his derriere with an excellent short ball.</p> <p>\"The brass music is a bit average but the drumming isn't bad,\" says John Starbuck. \"Do we know who's playing?\" I think it's Reni although it could be the bloke from Heavy Stereo.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 60-6 (Cremer c de Villiers b Kallis 6)</strong> A third wicket for big Jacques. He just has too much nous and too much bounce for the Zimbabweans. Cremer, trying to pull, gloved a short one down the leg side to de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>14th over: Zimbabwe 61-6 (Ervine 28, Utseya 1)</strong> The new batsman is Prosper Utseya, the scourge of Stick Cricket addicts throughout 2005. Jacques Kallis has bog-standard Twenty20 figures: 2-1-3-3.</p> <p>\"One of my batsman's called Adriaanus Benkenstein, who's clearly channelling South Africa's Dale Benkenstein,\" says Patrick Kingsley. \"Big difference, though. Dale never played a Test. Adriaanus averages 70 from 87.\" Pah. He's go nothing on Sir Donald <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/westindies/content/player/51874.html\">Ganteaume</a>.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>15th over: Zimbabwe 65-6 (Ervine 29, Utseya 2)</strong> Morne Morkel finishes with figures of 4-0-16-2. I've seen worse.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>16th over: Zimbabwe 69-6 (Ervine 31, Utseya 4)</strong> Four from Johan Botha's third over. Pulitzer please!</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 75-7 (Utseya c de Villiers b Steyn 5)</strong> AB de Villiers takes a stunning catch to give Dale Steyn his first wicket of the innings. Utseya fenced a short ball down the leg side, and de Villiers moved sharply to his left before diving full length to take a one-handed catch just above the turf.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>17th over: Zimbabwe 75-7 (Ervine 36, Price 0)</strong> Steyn ends with figures of 4-0-9-1. \"Following this summer's Olympics, and the amazing spectacle that was the Tour de France/Vuelta a Espagna, I've been kind of taking it for granted that if I like it, it'll probably be on TV, but I can't seem to find the T20 anywhere,\" says Mark Taylor. \"Is it digital or nothing for this one?\" Yep, every game is on Sky Sports. I don't think there are terrestrial highlights, though I'm not certain.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Zimbabwe 77-8 (Ervine c de Villiers b Kallis 37)</strong> Jacques Kallis has four wickets for five runs. Ervine tried to steer a short one to third man but it got big on him and went straight through to AB de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>18th over: Zimbabwe 80-8 (Price 1, Jarvis 3)</strong> Jacques Kallis has bog-standard Twenty20 figures: 3-1-8-4.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>19th over: Zimbabwe 86-8 (Price 3, Jarvis 6)</strong></p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>20th over: Zimbabwe 93-8 (Price 7, Jarvis 9)</strong> Ray Price hits the last ball of the innings for four, so Jacques Kallis fails to add a Twenty20 five-for to his glittering CV. What a miserable failure he is. He ends with figures of 4-1-15-4, and South Africa need <strong>94</strong> to win the match and eliminate Zimbabwe. See you in 10 minutes for their reply.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 15-0 (target 94; Levi 1, Amla 8)</strong> Kyle Jarvis's first over disappears for 15! Six of those are extras, with four leg-byes followed by couple of wides. Amla gets off the mark by flashing a slower ball to the extra-cover boundary, and he uppercuts another four off the final delivery.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 24-0 (target 94; Levi 8, Amla 9)</strong> We're having a few technical problems I'm afraid. Richard Levi has a few technical issues, but they don't seem too concern him too much. He drags a pull off the left-arm seamer Vitori round the corner for four. Amla and Levi might be the definitive beauty-and-the-beast opening partnership.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 31-0 (target 94; Levi 10, Amla 11)</strong> Ray Price, Zimbabwe's ageing left-arm spinner, comes into the attack. His last ball beats everybody, just bouncing over the stumps for three byes.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 38-0 (target 94; Levi 15, Amla 12)</strong> A good over from Kyle Jarvis \u2013 just three from the first five balls \u2013 is soiled when Levi boom-booms him over mid-on for a one-bounce four.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 44-0 (target 94; Levi 15, Amla 17)</strong> Hashim Amla opens his legs and shows his class, easing back in the crease to lash Price through the covers for four. South Africa are just fractionally ahead of the required rate.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 56-0 (target 94; Levi 27, Amla 18)</strong> Richard Levi hits a lovely boundary <em>on the off side</em>, flashing Vitori through the covers on the up. He repeats the dose off the final ball of the over. South Africa required 38 from 84 balls. The CH- word wouldn't begin to do things justice were they to lose this.</p> <p>\"Pointless is starting now,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Should be over in time for Eggheads, though.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 60-0 (target 94; Levi 29, Amla 20)</strong> Prosper Utseya is coming into the attack to bowl some offspin. Were this Stick Cricket in 2005 he would win the match from here. I can't have been the only one to have Utseya go through my team like a dose of salts? Anyway, his first over is a good one that goes for four.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 64-0 (target 94; Levi 31, Amla 22)</strong> The legspinner Graeme Cremer is fiddled around for four singles.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 73-0 (target 94; Levi 38, Amla 24)</strong> Levi slams a flighted delivery from Utseya over midwicket for a one-bounce four. Not long now.

  "<p>Muslim civil rights groups and community organisations have condemned a series of anti-Islamic advertisements that will be appearing in New York's subway stations next week.</p> <p>The ads had initially been rejected by the city's Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) but were later allowed after a legal appeal ruled them to be expressions of freedom of speech. One ad reads: \"In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat jihad.\"</p> <p>The ads are set to appear in at least 10 of the city's 400 subways stations and have been designed and paid for by the controversial American Freedom Defence Initiative, which is led by outspoken anti-Islamist activist Pamela Geller. The AFDI has been termed an \"active anti-Muslim group\" by the civil rights watch dog organisation the Southern Poverty Law Centre.</p> <p>\"You are talking about people like me being called a \"savage\",\" said Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. \"It is all bubbling up. I know there is freedom of speech, but with freedom of speech comes responsibility. This promotes hate.\"</p> <p>The AFDI first came to prominence during a prolonged fight about the building of an Islamic cultural centre in downtown Manhattan. Its critics dubbed the project a \"Ground Zero mosque\" and waged a high-profile campaign against it that many said was Islamaphobic. The SPLC termed Geller \"the anti-Muslim movement's most visible and flamboyant figurehead.\"</p> <p>Ads similar to the ones set to appear in New York have already been put on buses in San Francisco. However, the local transport authority in the city, known as Muni, donated the funds raised by the ad to the city's Human Rights Commission and also ran their own ad next to it that stated: \"Muni doesn't support this message.\" The AFDI has also sought to run the ads in Washington DC but authorities there have delayed them for public safety concerns.</p> <p>Muslim civil rights groups said the ads were coming at an especially sensitive time as world politics are already being rocked by violent protests and attacks on American embassies in the wake of the production of an anti-Islamic film made by an Egyptian Coptic Christian living in California. It also comes after several high-profile incidents in the US, including the burning of a mosque in Joplin, Missouri. \"They add to the overall picture of anti-Muslim feeling that is growing up in our nation,\" said Ibrahim Hooper, a director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations.</p> <p>The renewed controversy over the ads also comes on the same day as a major global report by the Pew Research Centre identified a rise of religious intolerance worldwide, including in the US. On the two measures the survey used \u2013 called \"social hostility\" and \"government restrictions\" - the US moved up the scale for the first time in both areas. When it came to official restrictions the US went from a low category to moderate, but when it came to the social hostilities index the country went from the lower end of the moderate scale to the upper end.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most serious dilemmas a government faces is whether or not to send its troops abroad to die for their country. The purpose must be absolutely clear, to protect vital national interests.</p> <p>Yet at no time since Tony Blair sent thousands of British troops to Helmand province in 2006, have ministers or their top brass offered a coherent explanation of why they are there.</p> <p>John Reid, defence secretary at the time, said he would be \"perfectly happy\" if they left \"without firing a shot\". Senior Nato officials privately told me at the time not to mention the possibility of their troops ever getting involved in violent clashes with al-Qaida fighters.</p> <p>Yet we were told that British soldiers were being deployed to Afghanistan precisely to ensure that al-Qaida would never again present a threat. We were also told they were there to make the country a better and safer place.</p> <p>For years, month after month, British commanders would reel off the number of children attending school, the number of markets opened, as a result of the efforts of their soldiers.</p> <p>But back in Whitehall, ministers privately admitted that it was not the job of British troops to risk their lives simply to improve the lot of ordinary Afghans. </p> <p>That, they said, as they saw the polls showing growing opposition to the war, was not going down well with the public back home.</p> <p>It was also not the soldiers' job to eradicate opium poppies. Afghanistan continues to be the source of more than 90% of the heroin on the streets of Britain. When I asked a very senior Kabul-based British official not so long ago what was being done about the narcotics trade, he replied: \"It is a difficult problem\".</p> <p>In one of his first speeches after the coalition government came to power in 2010, the new defence secretary, Liam Fox, said British soldiers were not in Afghanistan \"for the sake of the education policy in a broken 13th century country\". We were there, he told the Times newspaper, \"so the people of Britain and our global interests are not threatened\".</p> <p>More than two years later, after the loss of more than 400 British troops in Afghanistan, and long after Britain's own security and intelligence agencies agreed that the danger to Britain of any al-Qaida presence there had evaporated, Fox's predecessor Philip Hammond <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/13/afghanistan-military-plans-early-withdrawal\">told the Guardian</a>: \"We have to be clear why we came here in the first place...We can ask troops who are here to help build a better Afghanistan, but we cannot ask them to expose themselves to risk for those tasks.\"</p> <p>Hammond continued. \"We can only ask them to expose themselves to risk for Britain's national security, which is what they signed up to do.\" Britain had \"not come here to defeat the insurgency\".</p> <p>In that case, one may ask, why are any British troops still putting their lives at risk in Afghanistan? Why do they have to await the apparently arbitrary deadline of the end of 2014?</p> <p>Faced this week with growing opposition on both sides of the Commons to Britain's continued military presence in Afghanistan, Hammond made clear he was not told in advance of the US decision to scale back joint operations with Afghan security forces.</p> <p>British governments have got to get used to growing domestic opposition to foreign military operations as well as to America's military retreat.<br>\"America is drawing in its military horns and cuts in defence spending are supported by a war-weary public across political lines..\", noted the International Institute for Strategic Studies in its latest annual Strategic <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-survey/strategic-survey-2012/\">Survey</a>.</p> <p>The survey raises further uncertainties compounded by a growing diffusion of power. There are many different types of power, it says \u2014 military, diplomatic, economic, financial, market, people, reputational, even \"idea\" power.</p> <p>And to the neologisms of hard, soft, and smart, power, could be now be added \"fast power\" \u2014 the ability to shape events at speed effectively. Then there is the emergence even of the \"privatisation of foreign policy\".</p> <p>\"Public policy responsibilities cannot now fall only on the narrrowing shoulders of government', the IISS warns. \"Companies acting abroad need to go beyond corporate social responsibility and develop virtual foreign polices if they are to protect their interests and the environments in which they succeed\".</p> <p>All this has profound implications for how Britain \u2014 and the US \u2014 will deploy their troops after they withdraw them from Afghanistan in a little more than two years' time.</p>",

Why? (The first question all children ask).

As more people donate their teeth, the Palace will grow over time like a coral reef, to form a stalagmite-like structure of crystal resin, encrusted in barnacle formations using baby teeth donated by children in the UK and around the world.&#xa0;To donate your milk teeth <a href=\"http://palaces.org.uk/donate-your-tooth/\">go online here.</a></p> </blockquote> <p>As disposable body parts, milk teeth have particular potential for stem cell research. There is however, the knotty problem of the Tooth Fairy. Czarnecki has thought about this. She suggests:</p> <blockquote> <p>the Palace is a magical place for a child to see their milk teeth but to avoid destroying the fairy side of things, why not leave a token or a letter created by the child on their pillow for the tooth fairy to collect, which means they can still receive money but the tooth is left behind to donate to the Palace. </p> </blockquote> <p>She also wants to receive stories and drawings or find out what happens to children's milk teeth in different cultures. These will be part of a growing on line exhibition on the palace's website and some will form part of the exhibition as it tours nationally and overseas. As she says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Teeth are one of the parts of the body we lose naturally, and their loss is a sign of growth and development rather than decay. Different cultures have varying traditions about where these teeth go, and what they are used for and I am interested in looking at how waste body parts such as teeth could play a new role in our own science-based culture. Your tooth will be carefully looked after by our own tooth fairy until it is ready to be added to the Palace, along with the thousands of other milk teeth donated.</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I had some to give.

  "<p>Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC has gone head to head with rival Nokia by unveiling two new brightly-coloured handsets that have been chosen as \"signature\" Windows Phone 8 phones by Microsoft.</p> <p>HTC, which has been struggling with falling revenues as it competes in the Android handset market with dominant maker Samsung, said that the phones will be available from November across multiple carriers around the world.</p> <p>The two HTC handsets \u2013 the Windows Phone 8X and the Windows Phone 8S \u2013 will pit it directly against Nokia, which earlier this month also launched two colourful Windows Phone models.</p> <p>Both companies have been held back from putting their handsets on sale or announcing prices at once because Microsoft has not formally announced the Windows Phone 8 software; that will not happen until the end of October, alongside the launch of the new Windows 8 desktop and tablet operating system.</p> <p>Like Nokia, HTC is under pressure to generate strong sales from its next round of phones after losing significant ground to Samsung and Apple, which together make up half of all smartphone shipments worldwide.</p> <p>With Apple boasting 2m pre-orders of its new iPhone 5 before it hits store shelves on 21September, Reticle Research analyst Ross Rubin said it will be challenging for HTC to catch up.</p> <p>But HTC, which has generated most of its sales from phones based on Google's Android software in recent years, will be able to count on marketing help from Microsoft.</p> <p>The new devices will be marketed as the \"signature\" Windows Phone 8 smartphones, Jason Mackenzie, HTC's global head of sales, told attendees at the company's New York launch event, at which Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer also came on stage. \"Consumers are going to love these phones, and we're committed to reaching them in a manner that's clear and direct,\" Ballmer said.</p> <p>But that clearly annoyed Nokia, whose sales and marketing chief Chris Weber <a href=\"http://twitter.com/CWeberatNokia/status/248449797558784001\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> that \"it takes more than matching colour to match the innovation of the Lumia 920\" \u2013 referring to the recently announced high-end models in multiple colours announced by his chief executive Stephen Elop in New York.</p> <p>Shares of HTC climbed as much as 2% in early trading in Taipei.</p> <p>Some fund managers were wary of the sales appeal of HTC's new Windows phones in the fourth quarter, despite their good designs and form factors, as the market share of the Microsoft's operating system remains small.</p> <p>\"Even with the rumored new Android models coming up, HTC's performance will be so-so this year, because its phones are still lagging behind Samsung,\" said Michael On, a managing director of Beyond Asset Management in Taipei, which does not own HTC shares.</p> <p>The success of HTC and Nokia Windows Phone 8 devices this holiday shopping season will be crucial to Microsoft, which has been left far behind by Apple and Google in the smartphone software market in the last several years.</p> <p>Gartner analyst Michael Gartenberg said HTC and Nokia were smart to distinguish the appearance of their devices from Apple's iPhone with bright colours, as it could make them stand out to customers who want an iPhone alternative. \"The best thing about these device ranges is that neither looks like an iPhone,\" said Gartenberg, adding that competition between Nokia and HTC will also help to generate some publicity around Windows Phone 8 software.</p> <p>Taiwan's HTC was able to share more signs of success at its device launch event in New York than did Nokia at its phone launch here earlier this month.</p> <p>While Nokia did not name any customers for its latest Lumia phones, HTC said that together its two new phones would go on sale at 150 operators in 50 countries around the world.</p> <p>For example, it said that either the 8X or the 8S will go on sale at three of the top four US mobile operators \u2013 Verizon Wireless , AT&amp;T Inc and T-Mobile USA .</p> <p>Until now, HTC has been betting on its One series of phones, but so far this year their sales have failed to keep pace with the growth in shipments of Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy range.</p> <p>Up to the second half of 2011, HTC, a former contract smartphone maker, had built a strong brand around the world with phones based on Android software.</p> <p>But it suddenly suffered a sharp decline in its fortunes, as first Samsung and then Apple moved into overdrive. HTC's profits more than halved in the second quarter of 2012 compared with 2011, and it also warned of a revenue decline of as much as 23% in the third quarter from the previous three months due to macroeconomic problems and competition.</p> <p>The smartphone maker is set to announce third-quarter results on 5 October.</p>",
  "<p>A drop in aid for the first time in many years and a rise in protectionist policies as a result of the global economic crisis risks slowing the momentum of significant development gains, a UN <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/mdg_gap/mdg_gap2012/mdg8report2012_engw.pdf\" title=\"\">report</a> (pdf) warned on Thursday.</p> <p>Experts from a taskforce that tracks progress \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 on the millennium development goals (MDGs) said they found it difficult to identify areas of significant new progress on MDG8 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-global-partnership\" title=\"\">to develop a global partnership</a> \u2013 which focuses on what rich countries can and should do.

Only Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark and the Netherlands still provided aid over and above the UN target of 0.7% of donor country GNI. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/11/government-un-overseas-aid\" title=\"\">Britain's new international development secretary, Justine Greening, has restated a commitment to meet the UN target by next year</a>, although the government has backed away from enshrining its election pledge into law.</p> <p>According to the MDG gap taskforce report, the Global Partnership for Development: Making Rhetoric a Reality, total ODA should more than double to $300bn, leaving a gap of $167bn. \"Growth of core ODA is expected to stagnate between 2013 and 2015, reflecting the delayed impact of the global economic crisis on donor country budgets,\" said the report, which argues that implementing international partnership commitments, particularly on aid, does not require substantial economic sacrifices in developed economies.</p> <p>The report expressed concern about the rise in protectionist trade policies and frustration with the stalled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/03/doha-round-trade-talks-explainer\" title=\"\">Doha round of trade negotiations, which have dragged out for 11 years</a>. Doha was supposed to bring greater opportunities for developing countries to gain from world trade. \"The current economic situation has lured governments back into using protectionist trade policies,\" said the taskforce. \"The implementation of new trade restrictions by Group of Twenty [G20] countries has not slowed down, and their increasing effects on global trade are now a cause for concern.\"</p> <p>More broadly, the report acknowledges a waning of support for the global partnership due to rich countries failing to honour their pledges. \"How many times and in how many forums can the member countries of WTO [World Trade Organisation] pledge to complete the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations without delivering on that pledge and still retain their credibility \u2026 How many times will multilateral conferences need to issue bland and non-committal outcome declarations to paper over deep divisions?\" said the report.</p> <p>The taskforce argues that international solidarity is still the compelling, moral case for partnership for development, as well as more pragmatic reasons. \"Rich people may try to live behind fortress walls in their countries and rich countries may try to erect fortress protections against the foreign poor. They would be all fooling themselves in our highly globalised world,\" the report warned.</p> <p>Some development experts, however, question whether the MDGs are behind the successes seen in poverty eradication. \"The goal of halving extreme poverty [measured by the number of people living on less than $1.25 a day] is likely to be achieved ahead of time, largely thanks to China's phenomenal growth,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/after-the-millennium-development-goals-by-dani-rodrik\" title=\"\">Professor Dani Rodrik at Harvard University's Kennedy school of government on the Project Syndicate blog</a>. \"At the same time, there is little evidence to suggest those successes were the result of the MDGs themselves. China implemented the policies that engineered history's greatest poverty eradication programme prior to, and independently from, the millennium declaration and the MDGs.\"</p> <p>Looking beyond the expiry of the MDGs in 2015, Rodrick argues for a new global compact focusing more directly on rich countries' responsibilities, as well as policies beyond aid and trade that have an equal, if not greater, impact on poor countries' development prospects.</p> <p>\"A short list of such policies would include: carbon taxes and other measures to ameliorate climate change; more work visas to allow larger temporary migration flows from poor countries; strict controls on arms sales to developing nations; reduced support for repressive regimes; and improved sharing of financial information to reduce money laundering and tax avoidance \u2026 Most of these measures are actually aimed at reducing damage \u2013 for example, climate change, military conflict and financial crime \u2013 that otherwise results from rich countries' conduct. 'Do no harm' is as good a principle here as it is in medicine.\"</p>",

  "<p>It's time for our weekly roundup of the best new mobile games for smartphones and tablets, beefed up to 20 games this week since it's been a busy seven days.</p> <p>These are all new releases, although some may have been released before on another platform to the one listed \u2013&nbsp;for example, Sky Gamblers on Android is a port of the existing iOS version.</p> <p>On with the show:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/street-fighter-x-tekken-mobile/id494500646?mt=8\">Street Fighter X Tekken Mobile</a></h2> <p>The two famous fighting franchises collide on iOS this week, just as they have on consoles. Publisher Capcom is keen to stress that this game has been made for touchscreen devices though, with new controls and an exclusive \"Gem Roulette\" power-ups feature.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.namcobandaigames.riseofglory\">Sky Gamblers: Rise of Glory</a></h2> <p>Namco Bandai's spiffing-looking dogfighting game (as in planes, not dogs) has been restricted to the Xperia handsets of Sony Ericsson \u2013&nbsp;now Sony \u2013&nbsp;until this month, when it's been made available for other Android devices. A solo mode lets you get the graphics-gazing out of your system before trying your hand in the multiplayer mode.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lili/id560692867?mt=8\">Lili</a></h2> <p>BitMonster's adventure-RPG is picking up a lot of buzz among iOS gamers and specialist sites, with startling Unreal Engine-powered visuals and the promise of a free-roaming world with lots of characters and quests. One innovation is a difficulty mode designed specifically for kids, too.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/rayman-jungle-run/id537931449?mt=8\">Rayman Jungle Run</a></h2> <p>It's a big week for big console brands on the App Store, as Ubisoft's Rayman made his way onto iOS. It takes the limbless hero back to his 2D platforming days, with 40 levels and bags of quirk.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.buffalo_studios.newflashbingo\">Bingo Blitz</a></h2> <p>Believe it or not, bingo is currently one of the most lucrative genres for the mobile and social games industries, with play-for-fun-yet-also-pay games taking Facebook and iOS by storm. Buffalo Studios' Bingo Blitz is one of the most popular examples, and now it's drawing lines on Android too.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/contre-jour/4e66e96f-6390-43a1-921f-d43fd5c9eb13\">Contre Jour</a></h2> <p>Beautiful puzzly-adventure Contre Jour has made the leap to Windows Phone, following lots of critical acclaim on iOS. Superbly crafted, if a little unsettling at times, it's also fully plumbed into Microsoft's Xbox Live community.<br><strong>Windows Phone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.illusionlabs.labyrinth2\">Labyrinth 2</a></h2> <p>Illusion Labs' Labyrinth 2 is a pleasingly traditional constructional-puzzler with bumpers, balls, doors, magnets and other objects all at your disposal to foil its <br>brain-taxing levels. There's also the facility to create and share your own levels, if you're so-minded.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/best-of-british-summer-sports/id559912898?mt=8\">Best of British: Summer Sports</a></h2> <p>BoB: Summer Sports sprang out of a wizard wheeze from a group of independent games developers in the UK. Created in 48 hours at a hack event, it's a collection of sports mini-games, with an emphasis on playability and a nice line in surreal humour.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lunar-silver-star-story-touch/id492598036?mt=8\">Lunar Silver Star Story Touch</a></h2> <p>One of the fun things about modern-day app stores is their global nature, which is speeding up the process of bringing games to the West from Japan that would formerly have required grubbing about in import shops. Lunar Silver Star Story Touch is a conversion of a Japanese RPG with all the questing, battling and slightly-baffling plotlines that fans of the genre would expect.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/demons-score/id532473429?mt=8\">Demons' Score</a></h2> <p>Talking of Japanese games... This is the work of Square Enix, which is encouraging players to \"Get ready for the off-the-hook break beat action. Surrender to the rhythm and tap like hell.\" It's crying out for a Brian Blessed-voiceovered TV ad. In the absence of that, this is a music rhythm game where your in-time tapping duffs up giant demons, a bit like Infinity Blade crossed with Tap Tap Revenge.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamevil.monster.global\">Monster Warlord</a></h2> <p>Now something from South Korea, in the form of Monster Warlord. It's the latest freemium card-battler game, which as the title implies involves all manner of monsters. There are hundreds of beasts to collect and combine, with a clan system to spice up the online multiplayer elements.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/crafty-creatures/id544715932?mt=8\">Crafty Creatures</a></h2> <p>Is the sudden popularity of \"crafting\" in a range of games all down to Minecraft? This game from Chillingo takes the idea into a puzzle game, getting players to make levels and creatures before playing them, and also sharing them with others. Like LittleBigPlanet meets Cut the Rope, a bit, and intriguing with it.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/guardian-cross/id534082757?mt=8\">Guardian Cross</a></h2> <p>Another new release from Square Enix, which is putting a lot of effort into testing out new games and genres on mobile devices in 2012. Well, I say new genres: this is another card-battler, except here the monsters are based on some familiar faces (and claws) from the Final Fantasy games. Moogles, mandragoras and more lie in wait.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ubisoft.premium.POPClassic\">Prince of Persia Classic</a></h2> <p>For something more nostalgic, how about a faithful Android port of Prince of Persia, Ubisoft's princely platform game from back in the day? The faithfulness stops at the graphics though, which have been beefed up for modern-day smartphones. Also good for fans are the multiple modes, including Time Attack and Survival.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/townsmen/id538411946?mt=8\">Townsmen</a></h2> <p>Out on Android a few weeks ago, HandyGames' Townsmen has now set up house on iOS too. It's actually one of the most long-running mobile game brands, having made its original debut in the days of Java handsets. You're building a city, managing its economy, and completing challenges to make it a bustling metropolis.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hotel-transylvania-dash-deluxe/id549713356?mt=8\">Hotel Transylvania Dash</a></h2> <p>Here's an interesting partnership: casual games publisher PlayFirst and Hollywood studio Sony Pictures Animation. They've teamed up to make a new version of the former's Hotel Dash game (think Diner Dash, but... Well, you can guess) featuring undead characters from the upcoming Hotel Transylvania movie. File alongside similar reskins for Brave (Temple Run), Hop (Doodle Jump) and Rio (Angry Birds).<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toystudio.thecurse\">The Curse</a></h2> <p>The Curse is a <em>proper</em> puzzle game: one for veterans of the genre who like something to really get their teeth into. 100 levels are included, blending logic, memory and reaction puzzles, with its cryptic challenges ensuring you won't blast through them too easily.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/recess-riot/id548555492?mt=8\">Recess Riot</a></h2> <p>Super Mega Worm remains the all-time awesomest mobile game about giant worms leaping out of the ground to eat people. Now its developers have something new: pixelly jumping and dodging in the playground, as you leap over ropes and duck a collection of balls. No giant worms, alas, but don't hold that against it.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kizstudios.critterescape\">Critter Escape!</a></h2> <p>This really is a good time for interesting indie games coming out on Android. Stealth adventure Critter Escape! sees you sneaking through 120 levels to escape, with the help of power-ups and the hindrance of puzzles. <br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rebellion.judgedredd\">Judge Dredd vs. Zombies</a></h2> <p>Zombies certainly don't shirk a challenge on mobile, turning up to fight against plants, Call of Duty soldiers and now Judge Dredd himself. Tying in with the new Dredd 3D movie, this sees the not-so-good Judge proving his law-amming credentials by laying waste to hordes of the undead.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <p>That's our selection, but what mobile games have you been playing this week?

  "<p>The most revealing exchanges of Wednesday's <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=183&amp;MId=4514\">mayor's question time</a> were begun by Boris Johnson's fellow Conservative, the admirably independent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewBoff\">Andrew Boff</a>. \"How many potential homes in London have planning permission but are currently in stalled developments?\" he asked. The Mayor's answer was as astonishing as it was direct. \"The answer is 170,000,\" he said. </p> <p>I'll repeat that for those suspecting a misprint: \"The answer is 170,000.\"</p> <p>Let's put that gigantic number into its wider context. London's eight million people live in about 3.5 million households. Its population is growing fast and, at the same time, the cost of first-time buying and renting here continues to be painfully if not prohibitively high for those on low and even good middle incomes. </p> <p>Several factors contribute to this dimension of the London housing crisis, not least inflationary market distortion caused by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2012/sep/18/london-housing-market-boris-johnson\">the global mega-rich falling over each other to buy high-priced property</a>. But a core reason is simply that not enough new homes are being built. This shortage too has the effect of pushing prices higher, as demand far outstrips supply. </p> <p>Were those 170,000 potential homes in stalled developments completed tomorrow all our problems would not solved, but some of them might become at least a little less acute. So what's causing the blockage? </p> <p>Boff tried out some possibilities on the mayor. In how many cases might lack of finance from banks be holding things up? Have some developers made life harder for themselves in terms of raising the cash they need to build because they bought land at a high price and now need to borrow an awful lot of money for constructing an awful lot of homes on it \u2013 \"at inappropriately high densities,\" as Boff put it - in order to make their investment pay? Are section 106 agreements, under which property developers contribute, for example, \"affordable\" housing, community facilities or transport infrastructure as part of their deals with the boroughs that grant them planning permission, proving to be an obstacle?</p> <p>The mayor replied that all of those things could be factors and stressed the difficulty individuals are having securing London mortgages, which doesn't help the situation either. He then revealed that, \"We've commissioned a study across quite a range of [the larger of] these stalled projects to try to float the boat off the rocks.\" He added that he'd be looking at what more he could do to help people to buy their own homes. \"That is one of the key problems in London at the moment,\" he said, \"And I'll be talking a bit more about that over the next few weeks.\"</p> <p>We wait with bated breath for any new rungs that might bring the stratospherically distant bottom end of the property ladder a little nearer to the ground. In the meantime, where does Tory Mayor Johnson stand on the Tory-led government's deciding to allow developers to renegotiate section 106 agreements so that they needn't build as many affordable homes for a while? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomcopley\">Labour AM Tom Copley</a> asked him. His reply was enlightening. I quote at length:</p> <p>I'm not in favour of a policy that basically lets developers get away with not doing any affordable homes at all\u2026[With every strategic planning application] that's referred to me we are as tough as we possibly can be in insisting on the highest proportion of affordable homes that we think the development will bear, and making sure that developers do honour their obligations to London. </p> <p>It is tough at the moment and frankly it has been getting tougher. We don't want the best to be the enemy of the good, as it were. You know, there's always a trade off. You do have to compromise. There are plenty of projects [that were] green-lighted in very good times by the previous mayor that had a very small proportion of affordable homes, and that is sometimes necessary to get the thing going.</p> <p>Very interesting. Johnson opposes developers being free to ditch \"affordable\" provision entirely but so does the government, which isn't actually going that far. The important part of his answer was his insisting on the highest proportion of affordable homes \"that we think the development will bear.\" </p> <p>Pretty soon, probably in November, Johnson is expected to consider outline applications approved by the Tory boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea (K&amp;C) and Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) for the huge Earls Court redevelopment project. This would entail the destruction of the Earls Court exhibition centre and the 760 affordable homes of the West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates in the face of deep and varied opposition. The full scheme, which includes the adjacent, smaller Seagrave Road site, would produce a net increase of <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/News/Outline_planning_application_approved_for_8bn_pound_Earls_Court_regeneration_scheme.asp\">just 740 \"affordable\" homes out of a total of 7,583</a>.</p> <p>Quite apart from the many objections to the scheme as a whole, is 740 additional \"affordable\" homes really all that the developer Capco can manage? The indications are that Johnson will accept that it is. No doubt copious data will be supplied to justify such an outcome, but I imagine Johnson's instinct is to approve anyway. </p> <p>Ever since his election in 2008 the Conservative mayor has been on famously good terms with the Conservative flagship H&amp;F in particular. Its former leader Stephen Greenhalgh was, and no doubt remains, a passionate evangelist for the Earls Court scheme. He's now Johnson's head of the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/policing-and-crime/about-mopac\">mayor's office for policing and crime</a>. According to <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/axeman-i-prefer-to-use-a-scalpel-says-policing-boss-with-met-budget-in-his-sights-8144151.html\">a profile of Greenhalgh</a> in Monday's Boris-loving Evening Standard, the two of them are getting along marvellously at City Hall.</p> <p>The mayor is not alone in thinking that some development proposals should go ahead despite offering very little or even no affordable housing - and it isn't only Tories in London who appear to take this view, albeit in some cases with heavy hearts. But the issue that should be at the core of the debate about London's housing crisis is how best to ensure that all parts of the capital contain sufficient amounts of accommodation that people from all parts of the wealth spectrum can afford to live in securely. </p> <p>No one pretends that achieving this is easy. Yet the case for trying is not only a moral and a social one but a business and an economic one too. The collective best interests of London will not be served if increasingly only the very well off can afford to live in it. Does the mayor agree? If so, could and should he be making that case more effectively?</p>",
  "<p>On the <a href=\"http://www.shell.com/home/content/future_energy/meeting_demand/arctic/\" title=\"\">Shell's website</a>, there is a section devoted to the company's operations in the Arctic. Decorated with beautiful images of glistening, lunar-like landscapes and indigenous people riding with huskies, it looks a bit like a travel guide \u2013 there's even a paragraph entitled The Alaska Experience.</p> <p>But beneath this pristine wilderness, Shell estimates, lies \"around 30% of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its yet-to-find oil \u2026 around 400bn barrels of oil equivalent, 10 times the total oil and gas produced to date in the North Sea\".</p> <p>Unfortunately for Shell, which has reportedly spent six years and \u00a32.8bn on Arctic exploration, things aren't going to plan. This week <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c50d102-00bc-11e2-8197-00144feabdc0.html#axzz270GW34ol\" title=\"\">it announced it will not be drilling for oil or gas in the Chukchi Sea</a> this year, since equipment built to contain oil spills was damaged during a test.</p> <p>It isn't the only company to have struggled against the ferocious Arctic conditions. BP indefinitely suspended a $1.5bn offshore <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/business/energy-and-utilities/shell-puts-freeze-on-exploration-in-controversial-waters-of-the-arctic-1-2530759\" title=\"\">oil project</a> in Alaska this year, while Russian state-owned Gazprom has also stopped a gas project owing to spiralling costs.</p> <p>Nature itself may have thwarted the fossil fuel industry's biggest dinosaurs for the time being, but as long as they have permission to explore, the threat to this delicate region remains immense. Now we need politicians to start taking responsibility.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/mps-demand-moratorium-arctic-drilling?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">a hard-hitting report published on Thursday</a> by parliament's cross-party environmental audit committee, of which I am a member, MPs are taking a stand and calling on the UK government to push for a moratorium on all oil and gas drilling in the Arctic.</p> <p>It highlights the fact that conventional oil spill response techniques have not been proven to work in such severe conditions. In the evidence sessions that put together their report, it became blindingly obvious that the infrastructure to mount an effective clean-up operation in the event of an Arctic oil spill simply doesn't exist. All the more shocking was the industry's laissez-faire attitude to this fact.</p> <p>An evidence session with Peter Velez, Shell's upstream global emergency response manager, found that the company is completely unable to show that they have made any estimate of clean-up costs should a worst-case scenario happen in the Arctic.</p> <p>Velez said: \"The way that I look at it is that I don't look at the clean-up cost. I look at what is required to make sure that we have the best available oil spill response equipment out there to respond to a spill.\"</p> <p>When I pressed him, he continued: \"We do not place a cost on that because our responsibility, in the unlikely case that we have an oil spill, is to clean it up and we are going to do whatever it takes to clean up.\"</p> <p>This approach to a potential disaster in one of the world's most fragile and ecologically important areas is in itself incredibly irresponsible. But given the impact that such a disaster would have on its shareholders, it's even more extraordinary that Shell won't make a financial estimate of the cost of a worst case scenario.</p> <p>The committee also investigated the profound impact that climate change is already having on the area. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet, with average warming of 1-2C since the 1960s and an accompanying loss of sea ice extent of 4% per decade.</p> <p>The committee heard that a collapse in summer Arctic sea ice, increased methane emissions from thawing permafrost, melting of the Greenland ice sheet and changes to the thermohaline circulation could all have serious consequences \u2013 pushing up sea levels and transforming weather patterns.</p> <p>So not only do drilling operations pose a threat to the physical landscape of the Arctic, the obsession with burning every last bit of fossil fuel in the Earth risks accelerating those deeply worrying changes taking place in the global climate.</p> <p>As the committee heard, there are already more proven fossil fuel reserves in the world than can be burnt safely if we want to keep global temperature rises below dangerous thresholds.</p> <p>These facts should be a wake-up call to all governments that we need to phase out fossil fuels fast. But instead we are witnessing a reckless gold rush as companies and governments make a grab for the untapped oil and gas reserves \u2013 drawing much needed investment away from the clean, home-grown, renewable energies that are readily available and will last long into the future.</p> <p>Unless a pan-Arctic oil spill response standard is put in place, together with a stricter financial liability regime for oil and gas operations requiring companies to prove they can cover the costs of cleaning up, no government should even entertain the idea of giving the go ahead for further exploration.</p> <p>The UK government must now respond to the findings of this report and show vital leadership by doing all it can to urgently secure a moratorium on Arctic drilling. I would suggest it starts with the companies registered in this country.</p>",
  "<p><em>You joined the Green party when you were 15. What were the values that you saw in the party then that made you make that decision?</em></p> <p>The key realisation was that we live on a planet with limited resources, on which you can't have unlimited growth. To sum it up in one image: the Greens had a poster at the time which said: \"We've only borrowed the Earth from our children.\" That single sentence still sums up the philosophy of my party for me. We need responsible lifestyles: we need to make sure that we don't use up the resources that belong to other generations, but also that we don't use up the resources of other countries. Fairness shouldn't end on Germany's doorstep.</p> <p>The nice thing is that the idea of sustainability translates very well from ecology to economics. It's in the DNA of my party that we aren't just OK with the idea of a balanced household budget, but that our very founding philosophy tells us that we shouldn't burden the next generation with mountains of debts.</p> <p><em>How has the Green party and their typical voter changed since then?</em></p> <p>The Greens are more at ease with German society and its values: this is our country, not an enemy we have to fight against. We want to change and improve this country because we like it. And society as a whole has become greener too. When I joined, I would have never believed that the world's fourth largest economy would eventually agree to phase out nuclear energy \u2013 and that even though the Greens were in opposition. What used to be considered alternative ideas are now mainstream policy.</p> <p><em>For example?</em></p> <p>When I was young, I used to collect rubbish in my home town and recycle in my spare time. At school I had learned how hard and energy-inefficient it was to produce aluminium, and how hard to break it down again. So my friends and I developed a concept whereby we would start aluminium collection points around the town and then take the bins to collection points outside the city. My mother used to curse me, because we ended up with piles of aluminium in our basement. But eventually the local council cottoned on to the scheme and started doing the same thing professionally.</p> <p><em>Why is the Green party so much more successful in Germany than in the UK?</em></p> <p>I wouldn't say that. Let's not forget that the British Greens once got 15% at European elections \u2013 we've never managed that much. The French managed more than 16%. Feeling a bond with nature isn't a uniquely German phenomenon. Of course, the debates can run differently at times. For example, the debate on nuclear power takes on a different course in Germany \u2013 the famed \"German angst\" does play a role, and I think that's correct. In the UK, the nuclear debate is more of an argument about cost. But that's not to say that the end results aren't similar: ie, that hardly anyone builds nuclear power stations these days. Everyone is more realistic about the dangers of nuclear.</p> <p><em>How would you sell the benefits of wind energy to the Brits?</em></p> <p>That's easy. It's not about ecology: there are pragmatic economic reasons for taking wind energy seriously. Onshore wind energy is cheaper and faster; offshore is more expensive and takes longer to build. It's that simple. For those who think it spoils their view of the landscape: would you rather have a nuclear power station plonked in the middle of the countryside? I find that logic strange. And of course no one in the Green party thinks you should just put windfarms anywhere \u2013 there are parts of the countryside that should be off limits.</p> <p>In the past, the energy market in Germany used to be run by four big players. Since the shift to renewables that we helped to bring about, regional authorities and cities council have become empowered to act as players in their own right, buying back the networks that they sold to private companies in the past. In Germany, a large number of windfarms are regionally owned: that helps to decentralise power and encourages competition.</p> <p><em>What do you say to critics of Germany's nuclear phaseout, who argue that it will merely end up having to import more dirty coal energy from abroad?</em></p> <p>We are looking at a third industrial revolution, and just as there were once those who opposed the invention of the steam engine, there are now those who hark back to nuclear energy. In Germany we now have just over 20% of our energy coming from renewable sources. All predictions from the past have turned out not to be true: when I went to school, my teachers used to say that maybe, just maybe we might have 3% of renewable energy one day. Angela Merkel says we'll have 35% by 2020; we at the Green party say it'll be 45%. My guess is: we'll both be wrong, because it'll be even more than that.</p> <p>And at any rate, don't listen to what Cem \u00d6zdemir has to say on this, don't listen to what the Greens have to say, listen to what Siemens is doing. Siemens are not switching from nuclear to clean energy because they want to lose money: they want to make profit. And I'd warn anyone who questions whether they'll manage: industrial policy, that's one thing the Germans know how to get right. If the Brits would rather hand the first mover advantage down to us, then so be it \u2013 as a German, I thank them for it. We already cater for many of the markets for renewable energy around the globe, and our future competitors are more likely to come from China than from the other side of the Channel.</p> <p>In Germany, industry is now starting to thank us for pestering in the past, because it forced them to go through the kind of innovations that the rest of the world is now catching up with. The Brits are still discussing whether they should insulate their houses better in the future, and we insulate them.</p> <p><em>Germany is proud of its export industry. But in order to make Europe work, doesn't Germany need to start importing more as well?</em></p> <p>I don't think it's a matter of either/or. The traditional left's mistake is that they've only read half of Keynes, namely the first bit about not making a recession worse by trying to save money. You learn that in the first term at university. But the second part of what Keynes says, that you have to pay your debts back in the end, that bit isn't so easy. It's a nice idea, but in reality no one does it \u2013 especially when you're dealing with four- to five-year electoral cycles.</p> <p>Germany's mistake under Merkel has been to assume that a country like Spain can get rid of its debt problem purely through austerity. So it's not a matter of \"either/or\", but a matter of \"and\": we need debt brakes, but also a long-term perspective for growth. And in order to get there, you have to deal with bad interest rates: our suggestion would be a \"sinking fund\" to pay down excessive sovereign debt in the eurozone.</p> <p><em>When, or if Europe emerges from the current crisis, what will it look like?</em></p> <p>Europe's problem isn't that Germany exports too much. The problem is that we haven't done enough to increase demand in Germany. The recent increase in pay rates was a small step, but the lack of a basic minimum wage is a problem. That's an absurd German quirk: it doesn't make sense for our British friends to have a minimum wage but not us.</p> <p>Europe's other problem is that there are some countries within the eurozone who are no longer capable of being competitive. Too much debt is certainly a problem in Greece, but not everywhere across the eurozone. Our main problem is that we need to become more competitive, and Germany shouldn't just stand by the sideline and comment but become an active member of the community.</p> <p><em>There's a theory that says we're looking at a trend towards ever smaller parties across Europe, who cater exclusively for regional and specialist interests. Is Germany on the path to Belgian conditions?</em></p> <p>That's hard to say. We saw the rise of a new party with the Pirates in Germany, but we are currently seeing a decline in their polling results. It's certainly true that the days of lifelong voter loyalty are over \u2013 all parties notice that. But you see that in Great Britain too, even if you have a majority voting system. If you look at the power of Ukip in some parts of the country, and the effect it is having on Tory policy, then you can see that even a party that gets 3-4% can wield a lot of influence. In every country in Europe there is currently a lot of insecurity, and populists are trying to exploit that.</p> <p><em>Does Germany still have a problem with the far right?</em></p> <p>We have to be honest enough to admit that there is a problem, particularly in the east. In most parts of Germany, we make a point of not entering a dialogue with the NPD [the National Democratic party] \u2013 we regard them as an anti-democratic movement. But we have to realise that there are small pockets in the country where that isn't the case, because the other parties have simply withered away. There are no short-term fixes for that, but we shouldn't ignore it completely either.</p> <p>We have to make sure that we don't just try to ban the extreme right, but also that we support those movements and those citizens that stand up to the far right. There's still plenty Germany can learn from countries who have more experience with diversity: one important step would be to make sure that the police force reflects the ethnic diversity of the population.</p> <p><em>Does Germany have a problem with the way it treats its migrant population?</em></p> <p>For a long time, Germans only knew non-whites living in Germany as <em>Ausl\u00e4nder</em>, \"foreigners\". Then they started talking about <em>Einwanderer</em>, \"immigrants\". But I'm not an immigrant, I migrated to Germany via the maternity ward of a German hospital. When I speak to my American friends and they ask me what generation immigrant I am, I tell them that in Germany, I'm considered a second-generation immigrant. But to them, I would be a first-generation immigrant, because I was born in Germany.</p> <p>When the Greens were last in government, we changed the law so that people who were born in Germany would also be legally certified as Germans \u2013 replacing a law introduced by Kaiser Wilhelm in 1913. If we win the next election, we want to extend the citizenship law further \u2013 not because we want to make things easier for immigrants, but because we think it's in Germany's interest that people who have lived in the country for a long time are recognised as citizens. Solving problems is always easier among citizens than between citizens and non-citizens.</p> <p>In 1998, I said I wished that people with a similar background to mine could play football for Germany. I got into lots of trouble for that: a lot of Germans shook their head and I got criticised in the Turkish press. And look at the national team now.</p>",
  "<p>Almost immediately after President Obama announced the killing of Osama bin Laden, top government officials, including then-CIA Director Leon Panetta and top terrorism adviser John Brennan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/04/osama-bin-laden-killing-us-story-change\">made numerous false statements</a> about what took place. That included the claim that Bin Laden was killed after he engaged in a \"firefight\", that he <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8491108/Osama-bin-Laden-day-two-and-a-new-version-of-how-events-unfolded.html\">used his wife as a human shield</a> to protect himself, and that he was living in luxury in a $1m mansion.</p> <p>None of those claims, central to the story the White House told the world, turned out to be true. Bin Laden was unarmed and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/us/politics/05binladen.html?hp\">nobody in the house</a> where Bin Laden was found ever fired a single shot (a courier in an adjacent guest house was the only one to shoot, at the very beginning of the operation). Bin Laden never used his wife or anyone else as a shield. And the house was dilapidated, showed little sign of luxury, and was worth one-quarter of what it was claimed. <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/osama-bin-laden-killing-media\">Numerous other claims made by the administration</a> about the raid <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/05/debrief-bin-laden-raid-sea-burial-kill\">remain unanswered</a> because of its steadfast insistence on secrecy and non-disclosure (except when it <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/feds-hide-seal-name-given-to-hollywood-135685.html\">concerns Hollywood filmmakers</a>).</p> <p>Would it have mattered had the White House been truthful about the Bin Laden raid from the start? It would have undoubtedly made no difference for many people, who simply craved Osama bin Laden's death without regard to how it was done. But it certainly would have made a difference for at least some people around the world in terms of how they perceived of these actions and whether they approved \u2013 which is presumably why the White House was so eager to insist on these falsehoods and to ensure that the world's perception was shaped by them. (Please spare me the \"fog of war\" excuse: when the so-called \"fog of war\" causes the US government to make inaccurate claims that <em>undermine </em>its interests, rather than <em>bolster</em> them \u2013 as always happens \u2013 then that excuse will be plausible.)</p> <p>There's obviously an enormous difference between killing someone in a firefight and shooting him in cold blood while he's unarmed. The morning after the Bin Laden killing was announced, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/05/02/bin_laden_12/\">I wrote</a> that although I'd have preferred he be captured and tried, \"if he in fact used force to resist capture, then the US military was entitled to use force against him, the way American police routinely do against suspects who use violence to resist capture.\" At least one legal scholar has <a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/29/author-of-no-easy-day-admits-to-committing-a-war-crime/\">changed his mind</a> about the legality of the killing, in the wake of evidence that Bin Laden was killed while lying on the ground, unarmed and severely wounded.</p> <p>But no matter. The White House's initial statements about what happened, false though they turned out to be, forever shaped perceptions of that event. Many people are unwilling to change their minds even in the wake of new evidence, while many others hear only of the initial claims made when news coverage is at its peak and never become aware of subsequent corrections. Combine that with the generalized \"Look Forward, Not Backward\" mentality <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K27oIJlAlA\">popularized by President Obama</a> \u2013 as embodied by <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/08/shut-up-and-move-on-kerry-says/\">John Kerry's \"shut up and move on\" decree</a> to those asking questions about what really happened in the Bin Laden raid \u2013 and those initial White House falsehoods did the trick.</p> <p>We now see exactly the same pattern emerging with the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya and the killing of the US ambassador. For a full week now, administration officials have <a href=\"http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/white-house-insists-benghazi-attack-was-not-pre-planned-was-all-about-a-movie/\">categorically insisted</a> that the prime, if not only, cause of the attack was spontaneous anger over the anti-Muhammad film, The Innocence of Muslims.</p> <p>Last week, White House spokesman Jay Carney <a href=\"http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2012/09/14/shocking-video-wh-spox-jay-carney-says-attacks-are-reaction-to-film-not-us-policy-and-were-not-pre-planned/\">insisted</a> that \"these protests, were in reaction to a video that had spread to the region.\" On Friday, <a href=\"http://www.mediaite.com/tv/carney-global-protests-directed-at-offensive-video-not-u-s-policy-or-the-obama-administration/\">he claimed</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'This is a fairly volatile situation, and it is in response not to US policy, not to, obviously, the administration, not to the American people. It is in response to a video \u2013 a film \u2013 that we have judged to be reprehensive and disgusting. That in no way justifies any violent reaction to it. But this is not a case of protests directed at the United States, writ large, or at US policy. This is in response to a video that is offensive and \u2013 to Muslims.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Sunday, UN ambassador Susan Rice, when asked about the impetus for the attack, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/ambassador-susan-rice-libya-attack-not-premeditated/\">said that</a> \"this began as, it was a spontaneous \u2013 not a premeditated \u2013 response to what had transpired in Cairo,\" and added: \"In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated.\" In other interviews, she <a href=\"http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/17/un-amb-rice-libya-attack-was-spontaneous/\">insisted</a> that the Benghazi violence was a \"spontaneous\" reaction to the film.</p> <p>Predictably, and by design, most media accounts from the day after the Benghazi attack repeated the White House line as though it were fact, just as they did for the Bin Laden killing. Said <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/12/160989062/u-s-ambassador-to-libya-killed-in-attack\">NPR on 12 September</a>: \"The US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi <em>by protesters angry over a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad</em>.\" The Daily Beast <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/12/riot-after-anti-islam-film-u-s-ambassador-to-libya-killed.html\">reported</a> that the ambassador \"died in a rocket attack on the embassy amid violent protests over a US-produced film deemed insulting to Islam.\" To date, numerous people <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-ambassador-killed-libya-sam-bacile-stevens-369785\">believe</a> \u2013 as though there were no dispute about it \u2013 that Muslims attacked the consulate and killed the US ambassador \"because they were angry about a film\".</p> <p>As it turns out, this claim is almost certainly false. And now, a week later, even the US government is acknowledging that, as <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/09/19/169102/us-official-calls-benghazi-consulate.html\">McClatchy reports this morning</a> [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Obama administration acknowledged for the first time Wednesday that last week's assault on the US consulate compound in Benghazi that left the US ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead was a 'terrorist attack' apparently launched by local Islamic militants and foreigners linked to al-Qaida's leadership or regional allies.</p> <p>\"'I would say they were killed in the course of a terrorist attack,' said Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.</p> <p>\"It was the first time that a senior administration official had said the attack was <em>not the result of a demonstration over an anti-Islam video that has been cited as the spark for protests in dozens of countries over the past week</em> .'The picture that is emerging is one where a number of different individuals were involved,' Olsen said.\" [My emphasis]</p> </blockquote> <p>Worse, it isn't as though there had been no evidence of more accurate information before Wednesday. To the contrary, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/chaos-at-the-consulate-as-militants-attack/2012/09/12/f92ad9d2-fcfe-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html\">most evidence from the start</a> strongly suggested that the White House's claims \u2013 that this attack was motivated by anger over a film \u2013 were false. From McClatchy:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The head of Libya's interim government, key US lawmakers and experts contend that the attack appeared long-planned, complex and well-coordinated, matching descriptions given to McClatchy last week by the consulate's landlord and a wounded security guard, who denied there was a protest at the time and said the attackers carried the banner of Ansar al-Shariah, an Islamist militia.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, Libya's president has spent the week <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2012/09/libyan-president-no-doubt-consulate-attack-preplanned-135664.html\">publicly announcing</a> that there is \"no doubt\" the attack was planned well in advance and had nothing to do with the video.</p> <p>CBS News <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/report-never-anti-american-protest-benghazi-only-planned-attack_652761.html\">reported Thursday morning</a> that there was no anti-video protest at all at the consulate. Witnesses insist, said CBS, \"that there was <em>never</em> an anti-American protest outside of the consulate. Instead, they say, it came under planned attack.\" That, noted the network, \"is in direct contradiction to the administration's account of the incident.\" The report concluded: \"What's clear is that the public won't get a detailed account of what happened until after the election.\"</p> <p>The Obama White House's interest in spreading this falsehood is multi-fold and obvious:</p> <p>For one, the claim that this attack was just about anger over an anti-Muhammad video completely absolves the US government of any responsibility or even role in provoking the anti-American rage driving it. After all, if the violence that erupted in that region is driven only by anger over some independent film about Muhammad, then no rational person would blame the US government for it, and there could be no suggestion that its actions in the region \u2013 things like <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-16/nato-airstrike-kills-eight-women-civilians-in-afghanistan.html\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/7806882/US-cluster-bombs-killed-35-women-and-children.html\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/obama-to-abbas-u-s-will-veto-palestinian-statehood-bid-at-un-1.385932\">this</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/13/u_s_drones_deeply_unpopular_around_the_world/\">this</a> \u2013 had any role to play. </p> <p>The White House capitalized on the strong desire to believe this falsehood: it's deeply satisfying to point over there at those Muslims and scorn their primitive religious violence, while ignoring the massive amounts of violence to which one's own country continuously subjects them. It's much more fun and self-affirming to scoff: \"can you believe those Muslims are so primitive that they killed our ambassador over a film?\" than it is to acknowledge: \"our country and its allies have continually bombed, killed, invaded, and occupied their countries and supported their tyrants.\"</p> <p>It is always more enjoyable to scorn the acts of the Other Side than it is to acknowledge the bad acts of one's own. That's the self-loving mindset that enables the New York Times to write <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/opinion/the-united-states-and-the-muslim-world.html?\">an entire editorial today</a> purporting to analyze Muslim rage without once mentioning the numerous acts of American violence aimed at them (much of which the Times editorial page supports). Falsely claiming that the Benghazi attacks were about this film perfectly flattered those jingoistic prejudices.</p> <p>Then, there are the implications for the intervention in Libya, which Obama's defenders relentlessly tout as one of his great victories. But the fact that the Benghazi attack was likely premeditated and carried out by anti-American factions vindicates many of the criticisms of that intervention. Critics of the war in Libya warned that the US was siding with (and arming and empowering) violent extremists, including al-Qaida elements, that would eventually cause the US to claim it had to return to Libya to fight against them \u2013 just as its funding and arming of Saddam in Iraq and the mujahideen in Afghanistan subsequently justified new wars against those one-time allies. </p> <p>War critics also argued that the intervention would bring massive instability and suffering to the people of Libya; today,<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/libyas-central-government-exercises-little-authority-outside-capital/2012/09/19/d8f46610-0280-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html\"> the Washington Post reports</a> that \u2013 just as the \"president of Afghanistan\" is really the mayor of Kabul and the \"Iraqi government\" long exercised sovereignty only in Baghdad's Green Zone \u2013 the central Libyan government exercises little authority outside of Tripoli. And intervention critics also warned that dropping bombs in a country and killing civilians, no matter how noble the intent supposedly is, would produce blowback in the form of those who would then want to attack the US.</p> <p>When the White House succeeded in falsely blaming the consulate attacks on anger over this video, all of those facts were obscured. The truth, now that it is emerging, underscores how unstable, lawless and dangerous Libya has become \u2013 far from the grand success story war proponents like to tell. As McClatchy noted in Thursday's report:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Libya remains plagued by armed groups nearly a year after the US-backed ouster of the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Yet the facility was primarily defended by local guards who may have been complicit \u2026</p> <p>\"Since the fall of Gaddafi last year, Libya's security has been dependent on a group of armed militias, including Ansar al-Shariah, that represent a wide variety of political strains and interests and remain heavily armed with weapons looted from Gaddafi storehouses. Interior Ministry forces and the Supreme Security Committee have been accused of complicity in recent attacks by Islamic fundamentalists on mosques and shrines affiliated with the moderate Sufi strain of Islam.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Then, there are the garden-variety political harms to the White House from the truth about these attacks. If the killing of the ambassador were premeditated and unrelated to the film, then it vests credibility in the criticism that the consulate should have been much better-protected, particularly on 9/11. And in general, the last thing a president running for re-election wants is an appearance that he is unable to protect America's diplomats from a terrorist group his supporters love to claim that he has heroically vanquished.</p> <p>The falsehood told by the White House \u2013 this was just a spontaneous attack prompted by this video that we could not have anticipated and had nothing to do with \u2013 fixed all of those problems. Critical attention was thus directed to Muslims (<em>what kind of people kill an ambassador over a film?</em>) and away from the White House and its policies. </p> <p>The independent journalist IF Stone <a href=\"http://www.ifstone.org/macpherson.php\">famously noted</a> that the number one rule of good journalism, even of good citizenship, is to remember that \"all governments lie.\" Yet, no matter how many times we see this axiom proven true, over and over, there is still a tendency, a desire, to believe that the US government's claims are truthful and reliable. </p> <p>The Obama administration's claims about the Benghazi attack are but the latest in <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/07/18/washingtons-untrue-claims-no-civilian-deaths-in-pakistan-drone-strikes/\">a long line of falsehoods</a> it has spouted on crucial issues, all in order to serve its interests and advance its agenda. Perhaps it is time to subject those claims to intense skepticism and to demand evidence before believing they are true.</p> <h2>Other matters</h2> <p>A former British army captain involved in co-ordinating drone attacks, James Jeffrey, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/drone-warfare-deadly-civilian-toll\">an outstanding op-ed in the Guardian</a> explaining why drones are so odious and dangerous. I recommend it highly.</p> <p>Relating to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/conservatives-democrats-free-speech-muslims\">free speech debate</a> that has emerged over the last week, I have a question for those who insist that advocating or inciting violence is not and should not be included within the protections of free speech: should <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/fox-news-bob-beckel-calls_n_793467.html\">this statement</a> have led to an arrest?

  "<p>Getting an email from my mentors at<a href=\"http://www.live-magazine.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> Live magazine </a>about a Future of Journalism day at the Guardian, I was automatically interested. Of course I grabbed the opportunity with both hands because after all, it isn't everyday you get access to the headquarters of one of the world's most successful newspaper companies.</p> <p>Wearing my best quirky shirt and pressed smart trousers, I made my way to the offices in London's King's Cross for 9am and was instantly impressed by the design and beauty of the architecture. Being received by welcoming smiles is something you normally struggle to see as a Londoner on a Monday morning, and it made me realise how much these people value being here.</p> <p>Looking at the agenda, I was excited. It looked like a day where we could learn something, while hopefully getting a few business cards. I remember discussing with my colleague what sandwiches we'd be getting for lunch. From originally thinking of the day as merely a part of the Guardian's volunteer week, while also gaining some information for myself, nothing would have ever prepared me for what was one of the best days of my life, on a professional and personal level.</p> <p>Starting the day in the daily morning conference with most of the senior journalists and the editor in chief, Alan Rusbridger, was a huge honour to say the least. The Guardian is a household name for me with my father being an avid, daily reader. To be able to go home and \"facetime\" him in Syria to tell him that I had been in the room at the time when all the nitty gritty was being discussed was a significant moment.</p> <p>Every part of the day was beneficial. Working for Live magazine, I felt that large organisations in terms of journalism and getting our work seen aren't doing enough to get \"youth\" involved. I felt these huge, powerful companies didn't reach out enough and weren't much help at all. It seemed as though every year they made it harder and harder for aspiring journalists to get a job.</p> <p>However, after this day, I can honestly say on behalf of me and the crew at Live, the crew that are trying to make the future of journalism by the youth, for the youth ... We can honestly say that we'll have the Guardian on our team any time, any day, because we truly believe that they do understand the future of journalism. They continue to keep their traditions and the ethos of quality print news; however they understand the online and electronic future.</p> <p>Having recruitment consultant Hally Dervish talk us through putting together the best CV possible for thee industry, was information that will greatly affect the way we approach a job.</p> <p>The final part of the day was 100% the icing on the cake. Having Rusbridger give a PowerPoint presentation in such a relaxed, inviting environment was fabulous because, when does that really ever happen? To make us all feel comfortable enough to pitch what we feel is the future of journalism and to have our views seriously considered. Let's just say the older generation should watch this space, because Live magazine's voice of youth is coming through hard.</p> <p>A great, pivotal point in my career, and I'm sure for many others from the Live team. The day at the Guardian was life changing, and extremely useful. It wasn't a workshop, or just another day. It made us feel like we were given extra tools to become, the future of journalism.

  "<p>Psst \u2013 fancy a short cut?</p> <p>Gentle reader, there are any number of books out there promising a brave new business world of success and sustainability, but few and far between are the nine easy-to-read modules, by Giles Hutchins, in his book, The Nature of Business: redesigning for resilience.</p> <p>Each module comes with half-page summary in bullet-point format upfront, so you can take it or leave it, depending on your interest, progress or problem.</p> <p>Liberally illustrated with examples from dozens of companies across a range of sectors and countries, this is a hands-on, how-to guide for businesses and the people in them cunningly disguised as a book.</p> <p>You can start at the very beginning, in Module One, with the need for transformational change in these challenging times, where the current recipe for success needs more than an adjustment. Or you can jump in later on, perhaps preferring Catalysts for Transformation at Module Six?</p> <p>Along the way you can pick up case studies, all helpfully boxed out, from both UK-based companies such as Adnams, John Lewis and Marks &amp; Spencer, or global brands including Apple, Coca-Cola, GE, InterfaceFLOR, Nike, Nokia, Tata, Toyota, Unilever and Virgin. At the end of each module, there are questions to ask yourself on how to apply the knowledge of the module to your own life, what you want from it and the business you are in.</p> <p>There's a bit of history on the way, reminding us that today's orthodoxy is tomorrow's fish and chip wrap, a brush with philosophy, if that shakes your pom-poms, and some words on harmony, the ebb and flow of yin and yang. There are some memorable insights: who knew that Steve Jobs was a crucial \"fungus\" of the digital age, realising abundance by connecting, enhancing and leveraging?</p> <p>Some of the usual sustainability suspects are there, Paul Polman of Unilever and Richard Branson of Virgin of course. Some less well-known names also make an appearance.</p> <p>The changing and rising role of partnerships is explored, whether M&amp;S with Oxfam, Kenco with the Rainforest Alliance, or Unilever with the National Childbirth Trust. This is about a mutually beneficial working business relationship not a one-way philanthropic tax deduction.</p> <p>The idea of the conscious company is explained \u2013 that the more the conscious values and behaviour of employees align with those of the business, the more conscious that business will become \u2013 and that can be more powerful than any business goals or targets.</p> <p>We could all do with following the recommendation to restore some \"idling time\", to make and protect thinking time, and to have some time outdoors in the real world, rather than becoming immersed in the virtual connected world that is the day in, day out reality for many of us, slaves to the technology that was meant to enable us. Apparently Al Gore has \"dabble time\" \u2013 what a concept.</p> <p>By the end of Module Nine the notion of a resilient, optimising, adaptive, systems-based, values-led firm will appear eminently sensible, indeed desirable, rather than something coming in from left field in a world of profit maximisation and quarterly earnings.</p> <p>There is, of course, no shortcut to sustainability, resilience and the firm of the future. But what this short and simple book gives the reader is an insight into the range and depth of work in progress out there already; by big names and small. .</p> <p>There is much in it that is not new or original. The policy wonks and academic gonks may raise their eyebrows at the potting of some of the current resilience and sustainability literature. (Much of which is helpfully referenced for future explorers). But this book is not for them. This is for the busy business person, aware that the formula we have now is really not quite cutting it.</p> <p>But in the morass of ideas, suggestions and alternatives it can be hard to see where to start. Gentle reader, this coherent, concise presentation of the core aspects and features of a more resilient business is one good place. You may just find yourself more likely to be working in a more resilient business, better equipped to survive and thrive in the turbulent and transformative times ahead.</p> <p><em>Catherine Cameron is a director of Agulhas: Applied Knowledge and a visiting fellow at the Smith School of Environment &amp; Enterprise at the University of Oxford</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>If you are an economic liberal and a fan of the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">single market</a> you may already know about <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/barnier/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">Commissioner Michel Barnier</a>.</p> <p>But did you know he is also the champion of social enterprise in the EU? Barnier's 'slogan': \"There is no economic growth and jobs creation without social entrepreneurship\" launched the <a href=\"https://socialenterprise.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2011/nov/23/europe-financial-crisis-social-business-initiative\" title=\"\">Commission's Social Business Initiative</a> last November and set a timetable for action. The initiative aims to develop an enabling environment for social enterprise across Europe, helping people and communities to unlock their potential and respond to the crisis.</p> <p>A first achievement is the convening of <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/social_business/expert-group/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">an independent group of experts</a> \u2013 called GECES in Brussels-speak \u2013 set up to advise the commission and monitor the policy process.</p> <p>A call for experts opened in May. The process was simple and the group's first meeting took place in June. Breakneck speed for Brussels.</p> <p>Forty eight people were selected. Selected on the basis of expertise, not affiliation which annoyed a few lobbyists, the result is a diverse membership, balanced in gender and geographical provenance, spanning different generations and including practitioners, financiers and academics. <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/social_business/expert-group/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">The experts</a> are complemented by representatives of national governments and other European institutions.</p> <p>But the group is far from being cohesive. On the contrary, it seems Barnier wanted all the parties in the same room. It will not be easy to find agreement as thorny issues rise and different visions clash. The test for me and my fellow members of CEGES is whether we can subsume our differences and get the European Commission to really help this industry which needs better access to finance, more ambition in its potential and a greater recognition by the general public. We certainly don't want this group to end up as another talk-shop.</p> <p>So what are the thorny issues?</p> <p>First up, the definition of social enterprise. This must not get in the way of real action. Practitioners have debated definitions at length and some veterans would like to ring fence the sector and related benefits limiting access to only organisations with a certain legal entity or pseudo-social mission. Setting boundaries is fair, for example corporate social responsibility is outside. Only proven social impact will define what is 'in' or 'out'. The Commission has a firm focus on impact and is initiating work on measurement. It has also launched two research projects to map social enterprises across Europe and identify what economic data is already collected by governments.</p> <p>As part of the definition question, a voluntary label system for social enterprise is being examined by the European Parliament. This is a key action in the 'to do' list of CEGES.</p> <p>Other labels like <a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fairtrade</a> are valued by consumers and industry. But does the market want one for social enterprise?</p> <p>Second, follow the money. While the commission wants to increase private investment in social enterprise and the Parliament has approved legislation on a label for social investment funds, the determination of the cap on profits for social investments is still pretty vague and \u20ac50m for an impact investing fund pilot is stuck in the Luxemburg bank account of the European Investment Fund. GECES will discuss these questions at our next meeting scheduled in late November.</p> <p>The solutions are not straightforward but it would be an achievement if GECES got the pilot fund launched by then.</p> <p>The real bonanza may come from the new programme of structural funds such as the <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/esf/\" title=\"\">Social Fund</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/regeneration/regenerationfunding/europeanregionaldevelopment/\" title=\"\">Regional Development Fund</a> targeting regions with the lowest GDP and totalling \u20ac363 billion for 2014-2020.<strong> </strong>Social enterprise is listed as a priority but has no seat at the table in negotiations between member states and the commission. The start is promising but GECES must ensure that this doesn't get lost in the negotiations of the next 12 months. The commission needs social entrepreneurs to persuade national governments of this spending priority.</p> <p>Third, new law. We wait to see what place social enterprise is given in the text of a second single market act which will be published soon to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the first act. One of the improvements we would like to see is more support for cross border trading. It is not a reality yet for social enterprises.</p> <p>Eurosceptic readers will wonder if the push for social business and setting up the experts group is another Brussels gimmick to woo the public, to distract them from the social crisis and stagnant economy, without any concrete impact on the ground.</p> <p>Yet, for the first time Commissioner Barnier has put social enterprise at the core of European economic strategy. He has until 2014 to prove his commitment is more than words.</p> <p>Besides a new commission and parliament, by then the new European funding programme will start. We will see if the new structural funds support social enterprises; whether an impact assessment system has been adopted by the commission to measure projects and programmes; and if no regulation has been made unless required by practitioners and customers.</p> <p>Then Commissioner Barnier will have passed the test and could even aspire to the presidency of the union.</p> <p><em>Filippo Addarii is the chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/\" title=\"\"><em>Euclid Network</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/news-and-events/sector-news/601-filippo-addarii-selected-for-the-expert-group-for-commissioner-barniers-social-business-initiative.html\" title=\"\"><em>member of GECES</em></a><em>, Commissioner Barnier's expert group on social entrepreneurship.

  "<p>Berlin's political elite is gearing up for the social event of the season. Next week in the Deutsches Theater, in the heart of the government quarter, stars of German opera and music will gather with the heavyweights of business and politics for a lavish birthday party, to pay tribute to Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the politician who has done more to shape contemporary Germany and Europe than anyone else currently in office in the EU.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, who thwarted Sch\u00e4uble's ambitions, turning him into the \"best chancellor Germany never had\", will deliver the key speech for the wheelchair-using finance minister, who turned 70 on Tuesday. Sch\u00e4uble's mentor, the former chancellor Helmut Kohl, will not be there, underlining how the closest of political partnerships went sour and is now beyond repair.</p> <p>Almost a generation older than his cabinet colleagues in Berlin, Sch\u00e4uble is unique in current EU politics \u2013 with the possible exception of Luxembourg's veteran prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker.</p> <p>The German finance minister has been central to all the key events of the past 25 years. As Kohl's chief of staff and interior minister, the trained lawyer ran the negotiations and crafted the treaty on the reunification of Germany in 1989-90. In a powerful and emotional speech to parliament a year later, he clinched the argument in favour of moving the German capital from Bonn to Berlin.</p> <p>Currently at the centre of the crisis management efforts to save the euro, Sch\u00e4uble is the only EU politician still in office \u2013 with the exception of Juncker \u2013 to have attended the euro's birth at Maastricht in 1992.</p> <p>\"He's the only one left in office who knows all the history,\" said Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, who watched Sch\u00e4uble at close quarters in the 1990s when working at his Christian Democratic Union party headquarters. \"He has sacrificed himself for his country. He works a 70-hour week.\"</p> <p>Hans-Peter Schwarz, the prominent biographer of German chancellors, has described Sch\u00e4uble as \"the most sympathetic, the most talented, and the most tragic figure in the recent history of the CDU\".</p> <p>The word tragic refers events in 1990.A week after the crowning achievement of German unification in October of that year, a man found to be mentally unstable fired three shots at Sch\u00e4uble, who was campaigning in his south-western constituency, leaving him paralysed from the waist down.</p> <p>His comeback was prompt and he has never stopped since, even breaking a taboo in the late 90s by asking publicly whether the Germans could ever elect \"a cripple\" to the chancellery.</p> <p>Sch\u00e4uble is utterly addicted to politics, according to Hans Peter Sch\u00fctz, a journalist friend who published a biography of the politician this year. Within two days of the assassination attempt, Sch\u00e4uble was having his wife read him the newspapers in hospital. While barely able to speak, he was dictating passages for a book on German unification to his ghostwriters.</p> <p>In November, he will chalk up 40 years in the German parliament. If, as expected, he runs for re-election next year, he will become the longest-serving parliamentarian in the history of the Federal Republic.</p> <p>Sch\u00e4uble owes his career to Kohl, acting as the strategic thinker and brain who articulated the chancellor's gut instincts on German unity and Europe. The intense relationship turned sour when Kohl was discredited in a party funding scandal after losing the 1998 election. Long the CDU \"crown prince\", Sch\u00e4uble finally gained the party leadership but was also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/feb/17/germany.johnhooper1?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">tarnished by the funding sleaze</a>. Kohl and Sch\u00e4uble have barely spoken since.</p> <p>\"I was fortunate to be one of Kohl's closest confidants for 16 years, even if the relationship is now over,\" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last weekend.</p> <p>Kohl was also mentor to Merkel, who ruthlessly exploited the funding scandal to unseat Sch\u00e4uble as CDU leader and leave Kohl in disgrace.</p> <p>The episode illustrates why Sch\u00e4uble failed and Kohl and Merkel succeeded. He lacks the merciless killer instinct that all recent German chancellors have shown.</p> <p>\"He may have lacked the absolute will for power at the decisive moments,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/zum-70-geburtstag-wolfgang-schaeubles-der-unvollendete-11893324.html\" title=\"\">G\u00fcnther Nonnenmacher in the Frankfurter Allgemeine</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>Sch\u00fctz said he asked Sch\u00e4uble what he was doing \"'about the woman plotting behind your back'. He said he gave Merkel a sharp warning.\" But he was out-manoeuvred.</p> <p>The events of 1998-2000 explain the coolness between Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble. \"It's very unusual in German politics,\" Sch\u00fctz added. \"But they're not friends. They are bound together by loyalty. They both depend on each other.\"</p> <p>In Merkel's first cabinet from 2005, Sch\u00e4uble had his most controversial time in office as a hardline interior minister in the era of global terrorism. Civil libertarians were outraged by his demands for a policy of targeted extrajudicial killings of terrorists, and by his support for the Guantanamo Bay US detention camp.</p> <p>Since 2009, as finance minister, Sch\u00e4uble has been at the heart of the euro crisis, bringing an extraordinary career full circle. Senior figures in Brussels say that, in the endless negotiations over the euro, one of their biggest challenges has been working out what Sch\u00e4uble wants.</p> <p>Sixteen years ago, he published a controversial and farsighted paper calling for a \"hard core\" and a two-speed EU as the best way of promoting a European \"political union\", including a raft of integrationist steps abolishing national sovereignty in order to shore up a monetary union which at the time had not even been introduced. The 1994 blueprint is now being implemented in the eurozone in response to the debt and currency crisis.</p> <p>Sch\u00e4uble's mantra has consistently been that what's good for Europe is good for Germany, a conviction he delivers more persuasively than any other German politician except the former Greens leader Joschka Fischer.</p> <p>\"He's an old-fashioned, very serious European federalist,\" said Katinka Barysch, a German economist at the Centre for European Reform in London.</p> <p>But he's canny, proceeding stealthily by small steps on a long journey. \"Pragmatism and flexibility are usually better than sticking to principles which only produce stalemate,\" he explained in May in a big speech in Aachen while receiving the prestigious Charlemagne prize for lifetime devotion to Europe.</p> <p>\"I spoke to him afterwards. There were tears in his eyes. He said it was the greatest honour he'd ever received,\" said Sch\u00fctz.</p> <p>Sch\u00e4uble declared that he still held to his 1994 \"hard core\" Europe proposals and explained what he meant: \"We don't want a European superstate. What we should aim for is a new political order in which we further develop the powers of the national level. As much powers as possible must remain with the local, regional, and national authorities. But anything that can only work at the European level must be decided by European institutions and for that you need democratic legitimation. This is perhaps the briefest description of what is meant by political union.\"</p> <p>In response to the crisis, Sch\u00e4uble has urged the creation of a European Monetary Fund, would support a eurozone treasury and a eurozone finance minister, and is less opposed to Germany agreeing to pool eurozone debt than most in his country, although that is a very hard sell.</p> <p>Juncker is expected to give up the chairmanship of the eurogroup body of the 17 single-currency governments early next year and Sch\u00e4uble is frontrunner to replace him, although the French and others are resisting giving the key post to a German.</p> <p>\"Apart from unification, Europe is his biggest issue,\" said Sch\u00fctz. \"He'll do that job if he's offered it.\"</p>",
  "<h2>The big story</h2> <p>A violent reality check emerged this week: the moving image still has power to shock and disturb on a global scale. The crude anti-Islamic film Innocence of Muslims \u2013 allegedly a 13-minute trailer for a longer piece, which seems not to exist \u2013 showed that film, for better or worse, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/17/innocence-of-muslims-demonstration-film\">does retain the power to influence world events</a>.</p> <p>The first most people became aware of the film was on (ironically<br>enough) the 11th anniversary of 9/11 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/egypt-protest\">when protestors in Egypt beseiged the US embassy</a>; already the story was a news event, rather than a film one.

  "<p>Value for money has become a mantra at the UK Department for International Development (DfID) where first Andrew Mitchell and now his successor, Justine Greening, are in the enviable position of seeing the department's budget protected from spending cuts.</p> <p>To the ire of many Conservatives, DfID's budget is set to increase as the government is committed to see the UK meet the UN aid target of 0.7% of gross national income spent on aid next year. The commitment means that DfID's total aid programme is due to grow in real terms \u2013 taking into account anticipated inflation \u2013 from \u00a37.5bn in 2010-11 to \u00a310.5bn in 2014-15.</p> <p>Introduced by Mitchell, the value for money concept was intended to show the public \u2013 and more importantly those in his party \u2013 that UK taxpayers' money is being well spent.</p> <p>As part of this search for value for money, DfID carried out a <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/what-we-do/how-uk-aid-is-spent/a-new-direction-for-uk-aid/multilateral-aid-review/\" title=\"\">review of 43 multilateral development organisations</a> that received British aid money. Following the review, DfID stopped core funding for four small development agencies. On Wednesday, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/19/uk-aid-programme-better-value-audit?intcmp=122\" title=\"\"> described the review as valuable both for providing accountability to UK taxpayers and for promoting reform in multilateral organisations themselves</a>.</p> <p>On the face of it, what could be wrong in wanting value for money, especially when times are hard at home? The problem is that development is complex and the temptation is to measure what is easily quantified, such as the number of children vaccinated or the number of girls enrolled in school. Simon Maxwell, a development expert and special adviser to the international development select committee, warned against a too mechanistic approach to development and the notion that all things can be measured.</p> <p>\"There is a tension between what's easy to measure and what's important that is difficult to measure, such as institution-building, governance, agency, accountability and power, all the things that <a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198297581.do#.UFn0P79Z2IZ\" title=\"\">Amartya Sen</a> [Indian economist and Nobel prize winner] talks about,\" he told a forum organised by IBM, the computing giant, on the use of data in development in London on Wednesday.</p> <p>Even the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\" title=\"\">millennium development goal</a> (MDG)of halving extreme poverty by 2015 does not capture the complexity of development, he argued. While welcoming efforts to come up with more sophisticated metrics, such as the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/hdi/\" title=\"\">human development index</a> \u2013 itself an result of Sen's work \u2013 Maxwell said such efforts were no substitute for a public policy framework.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/sep/13/development-less-growth-more-wellbeing\" title=\"\">New indicators on wellbeing</a> will add something, but they will not tell us everything and they are no substitute for the political process,\" he said, pointing out the difficulties in promoting efforts to combat climate change in the absence of an agreement.</p> <p>Hetan Shah, executive director at the Royal Statistical Society, also warned against placing too much faith in measurements. While agreeing with the need for the development community to make greater use of data, he spoke about statistical challenges, such as the quality of data, who or what is included within the data and the danger of confusing correlation with causation. He also warned about who would be using the evidence and argued that data should be about strategy and how to improve it, rather than about proving a desired outcome.</p> <p>He said: \"There is a collusion between donor and recipient to show that funds have been used successfully because people who give the money\" have a vested interest in success.</p> <p>\"We need to retain a sense of the complexity of what we are trying to do,\" he added. \"Big things don't necessarily get measured and we need a sense of humility about what the evidence means. We need to avoid the temptation to think there are single solutions such as vaccines, and avoid mechanistic solutions.\"</p> <p>This is not to say that DfID should ditch its value for money campaign. The growing availability of data available and the increasing sophistication of metrics can be valuable. It's just that data should be handled with care. Look no further than the financial services industry, where sophisticated trading models to reduce if not eliminate risk were a chimera.</p>",

  "<p>\u2022 An article about the melting of sea ice in the Arctic during the summer months said its extent had shrunk \"18% this year\" to a record low of 3.41m&#xa0;sq&#xa0;km. This year's record low figure was in fact 18% less than the previous record low measured in 2007, rather than 18% less than the lowest figure recorded in 2011. Also, the past tense of shrink was given as shrunk \u2013 where we should have said shrank \u2013 in some versions of the story and a headline (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">Arctic sea ice shrunk by 18% this year</a>, 20 September, early editions, page 9; Melt sets record, 20 September, late editions, page 26).</p> <p>\u2022 We said the US presidential candidate Mitt Romney \"describes Tel Aviv as being only seven miles from the West Bank, though in fact it is more than 40 miles away\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-fresh-blow-leaked-video\" title=\"\">Leaked film clips leave Romney floundering</a>, 19 September, page 16).

  "<p>The hotel that was once a Bristol sugar refinery built to process molasses shipped from the West Indies seemed an appropriate setting for a discussion on how to build international trade links. Slavery thankfully isn't an issue any more, but bribery is a problem that companies all too often face when trying to trade abroad.</p> <p>Since the Bribery Act 2010 came into force last year it's been a criminal offence for companies to offer inducements either voluntarily or on demand. However, oiling the wheels of international trade with cash in envelopes still goes on, and Guardian economics editor Phillip Inman, who chaired the discussion, raised the dilemma faced by business people aiming to secure international contracts as the first topic for discussion.</p> <p>The message he'd been given by a major exporting company, he said, was that it takes time to invest in finding overseas partners who you trust. \"The advice was that you have to walk away from a lot of business because you get asked for bribes,\" he explained.</p> <p>Bribery aside, for SMEs looking to expand overseas, developing trustworthy contacts is crucial, was the message from Mark Mason, panel member and founder of <a href=\"http://mubaloo.com/\" title=\"\">Mubaloo</a> which develops mobile apps for large organisations in the B2B and B2C sectors.</p> <p>\"We made some apps for Germany and Finland and they went down well,\" he recalled. \"So then we decided we needed to employ someone [unnamed] in Berlin \u2026 it was disastrous. He did nothing. So what we're doing now is employing a German national in our office here, with the idea being to involve him in the culture of the business and learn for six to nine months and then go back. It means we'll have a German national talking to German customers.\"</p> <p>Panellist Tom McCarthy, chair of the Institute of Directors' Bristol branch, observed that SMEs with successful overseas operations have either a particular niche or are a knowledge-based business. Introductions and contacts are vital, he acknowledges, \"but also understanding cultural issues is very important and not always taken as seriously as it might be.\"</p> <p>Financial support, particularly for tech businesses, was a bugbear that clearly exercised those in the room. Where's the money and the backing, was the question: Mark Dodd, head of international at Lloyds TSB, made it plain that risk was the issue he has to grapple with.</p> <p>\"If there's an order and a payment programme, and it's been set up right, then there are mechanisms in place where we can go to the short-term guarantee schemes that the government provides,\" he said.</p> <p>But Dodd also emphasised that talking to your bank early in the process of drumming up foreign business is the best way to secure backing.</p> <p>\"Don't wait till the point at which you've got a contract,\" he urged. \"See us before \u2013 we can help in how you negotiate terms with your overseas buyer. If your deal is structured the right way, you could get finance.\"</p> <p>Banks aren't the only avenue for getting support, however. Mason made it plain that his experience with banks had been awful.</p> <p>Hilary Green, an adviser with UK Trade &amp; Investment said the local business support programme Business West offers advice on sources of funding, and provides the services of a finance specialist. In addition, Growth Accelerator, the new national government programme providing support to SMEs, has access to finance and is putting commercial coaches into companies, with the idea of reaching 26,000 businesses in the next two-and-a-half years.</p> <p>McCarthy noted that crowdsourcing finance is another option. <a href=\"http://www.crowdcube.com/\" title=\"\">Crowdcube</a> is a funding platform which posts business opportunities online and invites people to invest, he said. There are also \"some emerging small equity players whose money is not doing much in the bank.\"</p> <p>From the floor, a delegate backed this up: \"My experience in the last two years has been the business angels are stepping in, including the South West Angel Investor Network.\"</p> <p>The government's <a href=\"http://www.ukexportfinance.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Export Finance scheme</a> not only insures overseas business deals, it is also creating a network of 12 regional advisers, and Dodd was enthusiastic about the ease with which business has been done to date: deals worth less than \u00a3100,000 have gained support and the type of businesses it's financed have included emerging digital specialists which sometimes find it hard to convince backers of their credentials.</p> <p>\"They have been very open-minded,\" he said. \"Their main proviso is that there's an underlying order. It's not a bureaucratic process at all. And they're willing to give an 'in principle' view as to whether something is likely to be approved.\"</p> <p>Extending into new and unfamiliar markets can be a tricky moment for any company, so is recruiting non-executive directors a good idea?</p> <p>It seems that banks like them. \"We do encourage people to have non-execs,\" to help guide businesses through sticky moments, said Dodd, who also observed that \"it doesn't have to be a non-exec; there are good mentors out there.\"</p> <p>It's a good idea to recruit a mentor or non-executive at an early stage of setting up a company, observed McCarthy \u2013 their independent input \"can increase the discipline and focus\" of the business.</p> <p>If you want to drum up some international business, but aren't sure how to go about doing it, the message from the panel was that help is out there. Green was keen to explain that UKTI has a range of regionally organised programmes that include training, mentoring, trade missions and incoming visits. \"Most of it is free and anything else is subsidised,\" she said. \"And we have modest amounts of money to give out.\"</p> <p>Finally, there's putting yourself about. Networking, as long as it's with the attitude of partnering rather than just selling, can make a big difference to your prospects of international success.</p> <p>\"We go to most of the events in our sector, I do a lot of these sorts of things, we blog, we tweet, we go to a lot of award ceremonies,\" said Mason.</p> <p>You may be taking the plane to your international business meeting, but marketing your business internationally clearly requires a lot of legwork in the runup to takeoff.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2012.

  "<p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has launched a <a href=\"http://think.direct.gov.uk/cycling.html\">new campaign</a> for cyclist safety on the roads which, in summary, tells us: look, why can't everyone just get on?</p> <p>That's something of a parody, as despite its distinctly fluffy official title \u2013 \"Let's all look out for each other\" - the campaign from the DfT's <a href=\"http://think.direct.gov.uk/\">Think! road safety arm</a> has, at its heart, an eminently sensible message, and one I and many other on this blog have long argued.</p> <p>The DfT's point is that it's silly and divisive to discuss \"cyclists\" and \"drivers\" as if they're separate species. As the campaign points out, according to <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/statistics/releases/national-travel-survey-2010/\">the National Travel Survey</a> 80% of cyclists have a driving licence while one in five drivers ride a bike at least once a month.</p> <p>Stephen Hammond, the Tory MP who took over as road safety minister in the recent reshuffle from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/25/cycling-governed-dimwits\">reliably hapless Mike Penning</a>, has been wheeled out to provide equally sensible quotes to the effect that everyone had better get used to more cyclists being on the roads, what with the oft-cited \"Wiggins effect\" and all that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396438505\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/20/1348144767703/cyclead_460.jpg\" alt=\"DfT cycle safety poster\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The DfT's new safety poster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, the praise: it's great that the DfT are trying to highlight cycle safety, and it's a very good idea to highlight the false divide between cyclists and drivers, which the poster released today does very well. On that point, when in this post I refer to \"drivers\" or \"cyclists\", read it as \"humans who happen to be driving/cycling at that moment and are not necessarily defined by it and use other forms of transport on other occasions\".</p> <p>Now, inevitably, the quibbles. Firstly, while a campaign using such tactics can hardly avoid dishing out advice to both drivers and cyclists \u2013 both are given six advice points each \u2013 the inescapable fact is that when it comes to incidents in which cyclists get seriously hurt, it is drivers who are more likely to be the problem. </p> <p>The joint advice, \"Look out for each other, especially when turning\", simply has that much more resonance when you're potentially on the receiving end of half a tonne of metal travelling at 30mph. </p> <p>This is borne out by statistics. The gold standard for this argument in the UK is a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/15/cycling-bike-accidents-study\">2009 study by the DfT-affiliated Transport Research Laboratory</a>, which studied several years of accident data and concluded that in serious collisions involving adult cyclists, the driver was found to be solely responsible in about 60%-75% of cases, and riders solely at fault 17%-25% of the time.</p> <p>It's likely this is an underestimate of the true picture for two reasons. Firstly, those attributing fault were the police, who tend not to be overly pro-cyclist. Secondly, some of the accidents were fatal, meaning, of course, only the driver's account was heard.</p> <p>Whenever cycle safety gets mentioned debate tends to be dominated by complaints about cyclists running red lights. However antisocial or irritating this might be \u2013 I'd say very \u2013 it's not really a factor in this debate. The TRL statistics, which are to my knowledge by far the best UK evidence on this subject, found that where cyclists were seriously injured in collisions with other road users, them jumping lights or stop signs was a contributing factor in only 2% of cases.</p> <p>To return to the main subject, this is arguably a pointless quibble. You can't very well have a campaign highlighting the congruity of cyclists and drivers while pointing the blame finger mainly at one group. But it's worth mentioning, I think.</p> <p>My second worry is more specific, and was noticed first <a href=\"http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/dft-unveils-road-safety-advice-that-swerves-away-from-the-highway-code\">by cycling journalist Carlton Reid on his BikeBiz website</a>. While the bulk of the advice to drivers in treating cyclists with courtesy is eminently sensible stuff, one line stands out. It reads: \"Give cyclists space \u2013 at least half a car's width. If there isn't sufficient space to pass, hold back.\"</p> <p>Half a car's width is really not very much. That most typical of cars, the Ford Focus, is 1.8m wide, excluding wing mirrors. A car passing 90cm from you at 40mph \u2013 let alone 60mph \u2013 doesn't sound like fun.</p> <p>As Reid points out it also seems to go against <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_070314\">advice to drivers in the Highway Code</a>. This reads: \"Give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much room as you would when overtaking a car.\" The example photo shows a driver overtaking a cyclist with a gap of more or less a whole car's width.</p> <p>I've asked the DfT about this and they've promised to get back to me.</p> <p>But overall, let's give a muted cheer for the DfT. They've even gone to the trouble to get the heads of the RAC and AA to point out how many of their members also cycle, and the overall message really is long overdue: cyclists can't be dismissed or marginalised as an \"other\" group. Like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-secret-video\">Mitt Romney's 47%</a>, we're not always the people you might think.</p> <h2>4.14pm update</h2> <p>The DfT, or rather a private PR company employed by them, has answered my query about the advice for drivers to leave \"at least half a car's width\" when overtaking cyclists, as mentioned above. They say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's important when you're driving to give other road users plenty of space. The Highway Code doesn't specify how much space as it's important that road users take all the circumstances into account when overtaking. However, we would expect cars to give at least half a car's space when over taking a cyclist, which is why THINK! promotes this message.</p> </blockquote> <p>That doesn't really add anything, does it? Personally, I'm a bit alarmed the DfT seems to think about 90cm is sufficient overtaking room.</p>",

Here's the email in full (minus personal information):</p> <blockquote> <p>From: Chris Heaton-Harris MP [mailto:trumpdinnerinlondon@gmail.com] <br>Sent: XX August 2012 </p> <p>Subject: An Invitation: Donald Trump Dinner in London - 6th October 2012<br> Dear XXXXXX, <br>Please forgive the \"cold call\" approach, but I was wondering if I could interest you in dinner?<br>I am the Member of Parliament for Daventry and was the person who put together the letter of over 100 MPs calling, so far unsuccessfully, for the Government to drastically reduce the subsidies available for wind turbines and I lead the campaign against these things in Parliament. You can find out more about me and this campaign here: <br>http://daventrycalling.livejournal.com/tag/wind <br>I have garnered a great deal of support for the campaign and one of my bigger supporters has kindly said he would speak at a big dinner event for me to raise money for my continuing campaigning in this area. He is a famous and controversial businessman who is the \"Boss\" in the American version of \"The Apprentice\" and was a candidate to be Republican Nominee to be President of the United States. My speaker on the evening is Donald Trump. <br>If all goes to plan, the dinner will be on 6th October and tickets are \u00a3275 each with tables for ten available for \u00a32,500.<br>I was hoping that you or your company might be interested in taking a table at the dinner or even sponsoring the event. I am aiming to get all sponsorship sorted by the end of this week, so that we can then start to sell the tickets with appropriate branding on them.<br>If you are interested, please give me a call on my mobile (XXXXXXXX) or reply to this e-mail and I will send you more details. If not, please forgive me for the intrusion.<br>Yours,<br>Chris<br>Chris Heaton-Harris MP.<br>Conservative Member of Parliament for Daventry.<br> <br>Mobile: XXXXXXXXX<br>Website: www.heatonharris.com</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on 8 September, a slightly different invitation appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/eastmids.conservatives/posts/469217776446016\">East Midlands Conservative's Facebook page</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>An invitation from Chris Heaton-Harris MP - dinner with Donald Trump</p> <p>Dear Fellow Conservative,</p> <p>I am writing to tell you about an exciting and very rare dinner opportunity that will take place on Saturday 6th October 2012. The well known Republican and business tycoon, Donald Trump, has very kindly agreed to take time out of his busy diary and fly over from New York to support my campaign against onshore wind turbines.</p> <p>Like many Conservative Party members, Mr Trump, who owns property in Aberdeen, holds very strong views on the inefficiencies of wind energy. At the dinner on 6th October Mr Trump will warn guests as to the very real threat from turbines to Britain's landscape and tourism industry, with the aim of raising public awareness.</p> <p>Obviously, with this dinner being less than a month before the Presidential Election in the United States, Mr Trump will talk about other political newsworthy topics and take a handful of questions.</p> <p>In order to accommodate Mr Trump's busy diary, the dinner is being held in London, at the Emirates Stadium, which is home to Arsenal Football Club.<br>Dinner will start with a champagne reception, followed by a 4 course meal. Tickets are \u00a3275 each.</p> <p>Tickets can be purchased via Daventry Conservative Association by phoning 01604 859721, or by responding to this email. Obviously, to get the commission, please ask your members to name your Association when ordering tickets.</p> <p>Yours faithfully,</p> <p>Chris<br>Chris Heaton-Harris MP.</p> </blockquote> <p>Intrigued to know how many people might be at the dinner, I called the events team at Arsenal's <a href=\"http://www.arsenal.com/emirates-stadium\">Emirates Stadium</a> in London. A spokeswoman told me that the <a href=\"http://www.venuedirectory.com/RoomView.aspx?roomid=19454&amp;venueid=6513\">Royal Oak suite</a> had been booked, which can seat 500 guests for dinner.</p> <p>But then she added: \"It's been cancelled, though, due to lack of interest. <a href=\"http://www.daventryconservatives.com/\">Daventry Conservatives</a> never returned the contract to us that we'd sent out to them.\"</p> <p>I then rang Daventry Conservatives to confirm that the dinner had been cancelled. Yes, they said, \"due to poor ticket sales\".</p> <p>So, even with the star attraction of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> (who \u2013 lest we forget \u2013 is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/10/donald-trump-100m-golf-course\">opposed to offshore turbines</a> being built within eyesight of his \u00a3100m luxury hotel development in Aberdeenshire), Heaton-Harris couldn't get his anti-wind fundraiser off the ground due to \"lack of interest\"? What does this tell us \u2013 if anything \u2013 about the real strength and depth of the highly vocal, media-supported anti-wind campaign in the UK? After all, when DECC published its latest public attitude tracker survey (<a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/stats/6410-decc-public-att-track-surv-wave2-summary.pdf\">pdf</a>) this week, it showed that only 12% of those surveyed are against onshore wind power (with 4% \"strongly opposed\") compared to 66% who support it.</p> <p>I called Heaton-Harris to get his account of the cancellation. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>No, we didn't sell enough tickets. But we only had two weeks to do it. We've postponed it, rather than cancel it. We are now going to try and hold it in February or March, depending on Mr Trump's diary. He's very keen to help us. It is a party political fundraiser for Daventry Conservatives to help us continue with our [anti-wind] campaigning. So any funds raised will all be officially declared.</p> </blockquote> <p>If he does pull it off and sell out the 500-seat Royal Oak suite at the Emirates Stadium that will swell his local party office's coffers by \u00a3137,500, less costs. It's certainly going to be one to watch: not only to see if he fills up the room, but also which \"companies and wealthy individuals\" cough up the cash. Heaton-Harris told me he already has \"two people\" interested in sponsoring the event.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Kate Bowles, senior lecturer, </strong><a href=\"http://www.uow.edu.au/index.html\" title=\"\"><strong>University of Wollongong</strong></a><strong>, Australia</strong></h2> <p><strong>Think carefully about the questions used in student ratings:</strong> Rating a lecturer on qualities such as 'inspiring' is flawed because it's such a vague term. Students find different aspects of lecturing and lecturers inspiring, and as a lecturer, I wouldn't be able to apply the same measures \u2013 when I'm designing either learning outcomes or grading rubrics that will have to pass some kind of scrutiny, I don't get to say: \"This grade is for an essay I find inspiring\".</p> <p><strong>Academics must accept that the employability agenda is a part of HE</strong>: Academics within research-driven communities need to respect the fact that we have jobs, and that it's not a sign of the decline of scholarly civilisation if students also want jobs. This means that introducing issues of professionalisation, skills and employability to the way we talk about Jane Austen isn't the beginning of the end. We can still broadly support e.g. the liberal arts, but we do need to admit that the debt acquired by university graduates is significant, and places some responsibility on us to make good our claim to enhance student employability.</p> <p><strong>Academics are not their institutions</strong>: I'm not sure it's always clear (enough) to students that academics don't always strongly align themselves with their institutions. Many academics do feel responsible for the quality of the student experience, while feeling neither part of the union nor the institution. It's a complicated position. The quality of the collaboration between academics and students (who do spend quite a bit of time together) is sometimes underestimated, perhaps because it only gets attention when it's gone wrong?</p> <h2><strong>Gerard Tully, former president, </strong><a href=\"http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>Cambridge University Student Union</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>The National Student Survey (NSS) is a blunt instrument and will probably be negative for most student unions (SUs):</strong> Like everything on the NSS, the indicators aren't accurate. For example, most students will not need representational or welfare support during their degrees (which is a good thing) and so will have had no contact with the SU. This might equate to a poor response rate to this question though no issue exists. The NSS will also disproportionately benefit 'full-service' unions. Somewhere like Warwick or Sheffield, with huge SUs on campus that are the hub of social life, community interaction, political activity will come off much better than, say, Cambridge, where the student body is more disparate and diverse and the SU fills a very different niche. The question then is what will the fall-out be and will it be an important factor in University-SU funding arrangements?</p> <p><strong>Have realistic engagement expectations</strong>: Expecting even half of your student body to be engaged all the time is unrealistic. Our biggest campaigns (for example, saving bursaries for undergraduate students and taking a stand over freedom to protest) have probably engaged about 20% of the student population. That's about the same as SU elections \u2013 which I believe is higher than the national average, which is only about 13%.</p> <p><strong>Remember that up to a third, or even more, of students will be postgraduates</strong>: A PhD finalist will have very different priorities to an 18-year old fresher, despite the fact they might face equally serious challenges in their education. I would dispute that any campaign can unite all people and still be meaningful or effective. SUs need to campaign smarter, not bigger, in my view.</p> <h2><strong>Derfel Owen, student engagement and participation development manager, University of Exeter</strong></h2> <p><strong>Student engagement challenges student unions' attitudes toward the institution</strong>: A sector where students are treated as serious members of the academic community challenges the fall-back position of most SUs. They will have to drop the state of perma-distrust, verging on hostility, with the university as it undermines the ability of universities to take the student engagement forward. It would also require SUs to take conversations to the wider student community, so that student engagement does not rest, purely, on the shoulders of senior managers and SU sabbatical officers.</p> <p><strong>Use social media to facilitate student engagement</strong>: The challenge is making sure that universities, that are traditional very cautious and slow to move, keep up with the speed at which social networking and communications is evolving. It's also important for universities and SUs to integrate social media into their online offering. Too often we try to emulate existing platforms, rather than just use what exists already. Students like using Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, so we should meet them there, not try to force them to come to our VLE (virtual learning environment) party.</p> <p><strong>Case study</strong>: <a href=\"http://as.exeter.ac.uk/support/educationenhancementprojects/current_projects/change/\" title=\"\">Exeter Change Agents</a> initiative has been wildly popular and has engaged students directly in identifying opportunities for change and delivering creative solutions.</p> <h2><strong>Jenny Hazan, communications manager, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bamuk.com\" title=\"\"><strong>BAM Agency</strong></a><strong>, a student marketing agency</strong></h2> <p><strong>Clarity, communication and collaboration are key</strong>: It's important to remember that not all students are necessarily going to be active participants, so ensuring that they hear about what is going on and how their SU can represent them is key. In some institutions there is an age-old dispute between the role of the university and that of the union - these relationships need to be patched. Without these key relationships, there are bound to be difficulties for both sides in providing the best experience possible.</p> <p><strong>Don't neglect the international student experience</strong>: It's a co-ordinated effort between the university and the SU to ensure that international students do not feel excluded or only spend time with other international students. Universities must find a balance between laying on events for the international community and also finding ways to help them integrate with the wider student body. Read the suggestions made by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/apr/16/15-ideas-university-experience-overseas-students\" title=\"\">HE live chat panel on overseas student experience</a>.</p> <p><strong>Resource</strong>: The 1994 Group of universities produced an interesting <a href=\"http://www.1994group.ac.uk/documents/public/IPR%20Student%20Experience.pdf\" title=\"\">report on student experience</a>. While they concluded that there was no single defining notion of what a good student experience was, they identified significant contributing factors. One of which was \"a strong relationship between students and staff\". There is so much information and knowledge that unions and universities would benefit from sharing with each other.</p> <h2><strong>Dan Derricott, board member, </strong><a href=\"http://www.qaa.ac.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>The Quality Assurance Agency</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Unions must get better at shouting about their successes</strong>: From experience I know that though unions are doing some great work, working with the university to win for students, if they aren't supported by an engaging communications function that helps to 'close the feedback loop' then students sometimes don't see those wins.</p> <p>Better communications won't solve all student experience problems but it's certainly one of the jigsaw pieces that needs to be in place.</p> <p><strong>Unions are struggling to keep pace with the changes:</strong> Institutions have had to shift their thinking and practice to respond to the student engagement agenda, but lets not pretend students' unions haven't had to as well. I still think it's something we're struggling with in unions and our internal politics makes it difficult to divert any existing resource into this area (away from sports teams for instance) so we need institutions to help. Similarly, I wonder how much the profile and expertise of SU staff is changing to respond to the developing nature of the union's business and priorities.</p> <h2><strong>Alan Roberts, policy officer, </strong><a href=\"http://www.nus.org.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>National Union of Students</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>SUs need to be transparent about the complexity of their role</strong>: As democratic membership organisations, SUs have the job of both listening to their members and representing them through elected leaders. This is no mean feat if you consider the scale of work that a university undertakes, across multiple departments, for which student engagement is needed and in which the SU will have to voice one coherent view. Being transparent about how decisions, consulting members where possible, is a big task but lies at the heart of the lobbying responsibility of the SU.</p> <p><strong>Establish good organisational practices and rituals</strong>: We all have a role in demonstrating the value of student engagement, as well as making that engagement as easy and as natural as possible. This can't be done with the imposition of rules and regulations, but rather through a vision of the institution as a community that's not afraid to disagree with itself sometimes, and strives to make the experience excellent and rewarding for students and academics. Think of it as Investors in People meets Investors in Volunteers.</p> <h2><strong>Emily-Ann Nash, student experience development advisor, </strong><a href=\"http://www.brighton.ac.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>University of Brighton</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Students are members of a learning community and the SU is best placed to communicate that message</strong>: Partnership with students will enable students to become co-producers and partners in the academic community. The SU as the voice of students, and independent to their institutions, is best placed to manage and articulate these messages to ensure they are real and not just a tick boxing exercise.</p> <p><strong>Every student union should look into starting a student led award scheme</strong>: These schemes encourage best practice across the university, they are also a positive way of engaging with students and celebrating institutions. Brighton University's scheme is working with this year's and last year's nominees for staff development to influence, even lead our university learning and teaching strategy \u2013 its true partnership from start to finish.</p> <h2><strong>Jo Caulfield, president, Bangor Students' Union</strong></h2> <p><strong>Working with academics is crucial if SUs are to have any impact</strong>: Without a route in to the institution, there's a danger that student unions end up on the sidelines shouting about what should happen, and how things could be improved, but without being able to make any real impact. Developing relationships with academics is a way to bring about change, especially if you work with the willing in the first instance and then publicise the benefits to those who are more cynical.</p> <h2><strong>Emma Brown, representation and community manager, </strong><a href=\"http://www.uwesu.org/reps\" title=\"\"><strong>University of West England Students' Union</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Case study</strong>: We ran <a href=\"http://www.studentledteachingawards.org.uk\" title=\"\">Student Led Teaching Awards</a> at UWE for the first time this year. The response we got from both students and staff was really positive. Student were able to clearly articulate why they wanted to nominate staff, recognising key enhancements to their student experience. Staff commented that it made them feel rewarded and humbled that students wanted to recognise their work.</p> <h2><strong>Tom Corfield, founder, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fruni.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>free range university</strong></a><strong> (fruni)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Resource</strong>: SUs could benefit from internal online tools in the style of <a href=\"http://www.38degrees.org.uk/\" title=\"\">http://www.38degrees.org.uk/</a> to enable students to have a 'voice' on issues they are passionate about.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The British Horseracing Authority and Aintree racecourse have resisted calls to remove Becher's Brook in their report out on Thursday on the running of 2012 Grand National in April in which two horses were killed, including one of the favourites, the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Synchronised.</p> <p>The BHA and Aintree have ordered the start of the world's most famous race to be moved forward 90 yards, away from the crowds and grandstands at the track, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/18/grand-national-clare-balding-start-changes\" title=\"\">as racing broadcaster Clare Balding called for earlier this week</a>, and are to embark on a three-year research and development programme looking at alternative fence designs for National course. They have, however, resisted some of the more radical changes called for by the RSPCA following the deaths of two horses in this year's race.</p> <p>BHA director of regulation Jamie Stier said: \"We recognise that there is pressure and tension before the race and we want to alleviate that where possible. It is possible that a more controlled environment at the start, along with reducing the distance between the start and the first fence, could have the effect of reducing the early speed of the race. If this were to be the case, it would be an added benefit.\"</p> <p>Becher's Brook will undergo further levelling of the wider landing zone, correcting the settlement which occurred following works carried out in 2011 but the authorities have confirmed that this will not change either the dimensions or the character of the fence.</p> <p>The RSPCA, under its new chief executive Gavin Grant, had rejected the BHA's preliminary report on this year's race which was published in May, and called for \"seven key actions\", including the removal of the race's most iconic fence.</p> <p>Aintree and the BHA have embarked on a three-year research and development programme looking at alternative fence designs for the Grand National course. The work will focus on utilising materials other than the existing timber and protective rubber padding that make up the central frame of a fence, also known as the \"core\". The work is now in the development stage with prototype fences currently being assessed and it is planned that at a small number of fences be trialled with a different core at the Becher Chase meeting in December. Fence heights will remain unchanged.</p> <p>Widespread calls for the field size to be reduced from the current 40 have also been resisted. \"The Grand National course and fences allow enough racing surface to accommodate this number of runners,\" argue the BHA and Aintree. \"After considering the 2012 Grand National race there is no additional evidence to suggest the course is unable to accommodate this number of runners. However, the BHA and Aintree will continue to monitor this.\"</p> <p>Synchronised ran loose before the start of this year's race after unseating his rider, Tony McCoy, and the report states that \"additional measures will be put in place to minimise the possibility of a riderless horse travelling an extended distance before being caught prior to the start.\"</p> <p>The moving of the start will result in the distance being reduced from four and a half miles to four miles and three and a half furlongs. The starter's rostrum is to be moved to a position between the starting tape and \"no-go\" zone to reduce potential for horses get on top of the starting tape prematurely while more user-friendly start tapes are to be used, with increased visibility.</p> <p>The report also states that \"with effect from this autumn, a concerted drive to redress the sometimes much faster approaches towards the tape which can occur in bigger races as the jump season progresses. This will involve a more consistent methodology across the starters' team in the application and enforcement of the rules at the start of a race, and greater rider cooperation. A specific briefing between the starters' team and the jockeys will be introduced on the day of the Grand National.</p> <p>Further investment is to be made in irrigation equipment at the track, while an additional catching pen will be introduced before Becher's Brook in a bid to try and prevent riderless horses from continuing in the race.</p> <p>Aintree boss John Baker said: \"With regard to the modifications and improvements made to the course, all the measures have been carefully considered and are evidence based, in line with Aintree's on-going commitment to safety and welfare. We will continue to repeat this process on an annual basis and monitor the many variables involved.</p> <p>\"Further to the extensive 2011 Review, our policy remains one of making changes based on evidence and practical experience. It is vital we don't create other unintended consequences as a result of change, which is why the steps being taken this year continue to be measured.</p> <p>\"These latest changes reinforce the fact that we have never stood still when it comes to safety and welfare. However, we are fully aware in racing that you cannot remove risk altogether. What we can do is continue to act and learn from modifications we've made to ensure the Grand National remains the world's greatest steeplechase.\"</p> <p>In their report earlier this year in May the BHA argued that the deaths of Synchronised and According To Pete were preventable.</p> <p>The BHA's investigations found that Synchronised sustained a broken leg while running loose about half a mile after he fell at Becher's Brook, the sixth fence on the National's first circuit. The report says the horse \"appears to decelerate into the [11th] fence and does not jump it cleanly, dragging his hindlegs and hindquarters through the fence. It would appear he fractured his right hind tibia and fibula in the process\".</p> <p>As for his original fall at Becher's, the report says Synchronised \"appeared to have a clear sight of the fence and did not make a significant error but became unbalanced prior to landing and fell sideways on to his left side\".</p> <p>According To Pete broke his off-fore humerus when brought down at Becher's Brook on the second circuit. The report describes him jumping the fence \"well\" but having \"nowhere to go\" on the landing side, thanks to On His Own falling in front of him.</p>",
  "<p>China's manufacturing sector remained in recession territory for the 11th month in a row. The prospects for industry in the eurozone are getting worse. Despite Mitt Romney's gaffe-strewn campaign, America's faltering economy could yet deprive Barack Obama of four more years in the White House.</p> <p>For policymakers, these echoes of late 2008 are clearly worrying. Back then, the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to a collapse in industrial production and a sharp contraction in world trade. The current slowdown is nowhere near as severe as that suffered in the winter of 2008-09 but is evidence of just how hard it is to shake off the effects of the financial crisis.</p> <p>There are three big and interlocking problems. The first is Europe, where repeated application of sticking plaster cannot disguise the fact that economic weakness is spreading from the periphery to the core. The second problem is that little progress has been made in tackling the global imbalances that created the conditions for the crash of 2007. China's current account surplus is well down on its pre-crisis peak, but the growing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing are testimony to the slow pace of rebalancing.</p> <p>Finally, central banks and finance ministries have already used up large amounts of their available ammunition. China has started to ease policy, cutting the cost of borrowing and giving the green light to local infrastructure projects. But the stimulus is not going to be on anything like the scale seen in 2009-10. The US has just announced its third tranche of quantitative easing while the Bank of England appears to be gearing up for a fifth dose of asset purchasing. Public finances in the west are deep in the red.</p> <p>It is clear what ought to happen. A re-elected president Obama should sit down in the new year with China's new premier, Xi Jinping, and Germany's Angela Merkel to come up with a blueprint for global rebalancing and global reflation. That would involve a revaluation of the yuan and a commitment to stronger domestic demand growth in Germany.</p> <p>The chances of this happening, though, are slim \u2013 even assuming it is Obama rather than the more hawkish Romney sitting in the White House next year. The slowing of the global economy is making policymakers more inward-looking and defensive, with just about every country trying to export its way back to prosperity. Beijing's policy easing should be enough to prevent any further weakening in the economy, and there were signs from Thursday's purchasing managers' index that the manufacturing sector is past the worst. But the world economy looks a long way from returning to sustained, robust growth and the slowdown of 2012 looks set to continue well into 2013.</p>",
  "<p>Who would have imagined that a week after the Hillsborough report we would be feeling very sorry again for the police? The Manchester murders of PCs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/manchester-mourns-murdered-pcs\" title=\"\">Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes</a>, both lured into what the city's police chief, Sir Peter Fahy, called a deliberate ambush, raises so many questions that it is hard to know where to start.</p> <p>On Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mqq63\" title=\"\">Today programme</a> on Wednesday, Sir Hugh Orde, the former Ulster police chief, now head of the top cops association, struggled to get the right balance even on the very important contempt of court issue. Had Fahy said too much about the case and its background \u2013 even after the arrest of a suspect, Dale Cregan \u2013 to allow a fair trial? Orde said it had been about right in the circumstances, but didn't sound convinced.</p> <p>Murder can't be blamed on politicians, who rarely pull triggers except on shooting galleries. To a degree, social and economic circumstances can. We will learn in due course about the background of anyone convicted in the Manchester case. But politicians and media can be challenged over the way they deal with law enforcement agencies in terms of policy and publicity, structure, management and rewards.</p> <p>David Cameron has called the police the last great unreformed service. He's not the first minister to utter such sentiments since Margaret Thatcher's \"give 'em the money\" approach yielded less than satisfactory outcomes \u2013 as she would have predicted herself with any other public service but the police. But in unleashing reforms of police practices, via the former rail regulator Tom Winsor's controversial <a href=\"http://review.police.uk/documents/police-remun-and-conditions/first-report?view=Binary\" title=\"\">review</a>, and imposing sharp cuts to services, via Theresa May, Cameron is certainly trying to do something about it. Winsor has since been appointed as the first non-police <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18709449\" title=\"\">chief inspector of constabulary</a>. The coppers aren't happy.</p> <p>Looking at Hillsborough and other scandals, we can probably say good luck to Winsor. An outsider may be just what the police need, just as the politicians needed Ipsa to handle their finances and the press needs whatever sensible suggestions Leveson may (or may not) come up with by way of better regulation. And don't forget \u2013 you probably did \u2013 that on 15 November millions of us in England and Wales (not Scotland, Northern Ireland or London) are being invited to elect a local police commissioner to help make the force more responsive.</p> <p>All in all it's a big gamble at a difficult time, which could lead to a perfect law and order storm: disaffected and resentful police being reluctant to co-operate with reform or even to do their law enforcing duty when they feel misunderstood and under-appreciated.</p> <p>This week new guidelines were issued that police \u2013 and other frontline public servants \u2013 will be expected to implement, setting out a wider definition of domestic abuse. We can all follow that train of thought and applaud it, but it does put further strains on public services that are feeling the pressure of rising poverty and unemployment (they do lead to higher crime rates and social breakdown, yes?), not to mention cuts and exotic crime of all kinds, domestic and global. I read that the authorities are unable to claim \u00a31bn worth of assets from convicted professional criminals because the villains thwart the confiscation laws.</p> <p>The Met did not cover itself with glory when responding far too slowly to last summer's riots. Manchester's force did better, now I come to think of it. Yet a \u00a325,000 reward for Cregan \u2013 later doubled \u2013 failed to lead to a single tipoff in the month before his arrest on Tuesday. If people knew where he was but did not report it, was that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/police-manchester\" title=\"\">fear of violence</a>, or does it reflect community disdain for the police? We should try to find answers to that, too. Being tough on the right people, on violent career criminals rather than careless motorists or noisy teens, is crucial to the confidence of honest citizens in neighbourhoods rich and poor.</p> <p>We don't want police who stay in their offices or cars, as they do in some countries we could name. Nor do we (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/19/police-shooting-manchester-gun-weapons\" title=\"\">or they</a>) want permanently armed police. That simply raises the aggro and the death rate all round. Nervous young coppers can be as testosterone-fuelled as the criminals they face, and occasionally as capable of reckless misjudgment. But, warts and all, we need them to protect us.</p> <p>On an up-escalator on the London Underground this week, I stood six feet behind three young men who were quarrelling noisily and aggressively between themselves. They looked very volatile. I was nervously braced for trouble, and when one shouted abuse at a man on the down-escalator and the man responded in kind, they raced to the top and chased back down after him. I alerted staff at the ticket barrier, and transport police officers rushed off to investigate. Scary stuff. Rather them than me.</p> <p>\u2022 For legal reasons, this article will not be opened to comments.</p>",
  "<p>Manufacturers expect to boost production over the next three months, raising hopes that the economy is set for an autumn bounce, according to the CBI's survey of the sector.</p> <p>As central banks on both sides of the Atlantic stepped in to prop up demand and calm financial markets, UK manufacturers told the CBI they believed business would improve over the final three months of the year.</p> <p>Almost a third of manufacturers (28%) expected to increase production over the next quarter, while 21% expect output to fall. The positive balance of 7% was an improvement from August, when as many respondents expected output to fall as to rise.</p> <p>Manufacturers were also less pessimistic about their order books, though the balance reporting an improvement remained negative at -8%, up from -21% in August.</p> <p>Anna Leach, the CBI's head of economic analysis, said: \"Manufacturers believe that there will be a modest rise in output over the coming months\".</p> <p>However, she added: \"Uncertainty is expected to build through the autumn \u2013 with key decisions to be made in the eurozone and the approach of the US fiscal cliff \u2013 meaning that conditions are likely to remain difficult for UK manufacturers.\"</p> <p>Manufacturing is key to George Osborne's hopes of rebalancing the economy towards exports and away from consumer spending and financial services.</p> <p>But industrial exporters are likely to be vulnerable to the downturn in the eurozone and China, and the risk that the spending cuts and tax rises due in early 2013 \u2013 the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" \u2013 drive the US into a double-dip.</p> <p>Blerina Uruci, of Barclays, said the survey supported the idea that the second half of 2012 would be stronger, after three successive quarters of negative growth.</p> <p>\"[Official] data showed that industrial output declined significantly in the second quarter, reflecting a strong fall in June as a result of the Queen's diamond jubilee celebrations. We anticipate a recovery in output in the third quarter as this effect unwinds.\"</p> <p>However, Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, warned that the weakness of the economy at home was also likely to hamper manufacturers' fortunes in the coming months.</p> <p>\"While the CBI's September survey is relatively encouraging, the overall impression remains that life is still highly challenging for manufacturers. Domestic demand for manufactured goods is handicapped by current muted investment intentions, still serious headwinds facing consumers and tightening public spending. Furthermore, the current uncertain and worrying economic environment risks some orders being delayed or cancelled,\" he said.</p>",

On the government's vision for the NHS, they write:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In health the Tories face daunting political risks, entirely of Cameron's creation, not one of them mitigated by the ejection of Andrew Lansley. Voters may not absorb the administrative detail of a \"reform\" the chief executive of the NHS said was visible from Mars, but one thing they know: Cameron promised during the 2010 election not to cut or privatise the NHS. Those will be principal \u2013 and perilous \u2013 themes into the next election.<br>At the 2010 Tory party conference, Francis Maude said the government was relaxed about creating a postcode lottery for healthcare and other services, and that is precisely what results from the \"reforms\" now in place: as the state is rolled back, there can be no national standards. The public always strongly resents any suggestion they can get a drug or treatment in one place, but not another. New evidence emerges of the centrality of mental health, and how switching resources to psychological services could save large sums from physical healthcare budgets. But that would mean a central initiative, with the capacity to steer and reallocate. In opposition Cameron derided Labour's targets but has sought to reimpose the same 18-week maximum wait for surgery \u2013 demonstrating how often he finds centralism essential when faced with the consequences of the anarchy that characterises his competition policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Disability campaigner <strong>Adam Lotun</strong>, who is <a href=\"http://adamlotun.org.uk/\" title=\"\">standing in the Corby byelection</a>.

Blogger Johnny Void, following the work and pensions secretary's appearance before a committee of MPs, says \"it's becoming near impossible to keep up\". His blog, the Void, had earlier this week reported on a warning by charity Women's Aid that Universal Credit and benefit caps <a href=\"http://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/every-womens-refuge-in-the-uk-could-close-due-to-universal-credit/\" title=\"\">could lead to every single women's refuge is the UK closing their doors</a>. But in a later post, said Duncan Smith and welfare reform minister Lord Freud <a href=\"http://johnnyvoid.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/iain-duncan-smith-fudges-on-womens-refuge-closures/\" title=\"\">hinted at a partial climbdown</a> when they appeared before the work and pensions select committee. Void writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are wobbles on direct payments which mean that housing payments will no longer be sent straight to social landlords but instead land in the bank account of even the most vulnerable tenants. Once again however there is no real details, merely some mumbles that some people may be taken out of this regime. How these people will be identified by the faceless computer based system which underpins the new 'digital by default' benefit system has not been explained.<br>It's clear that Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Fraud are making it up as they go along. If they weren't being paid billions of our money you might almost feel sorry for the poor bastards designing the new labyrinthine computer system which Universal Credit will depend on. Almost everyday Iain Duncan Smith moves the goal posts or adds new layers of complexity to the project which is already running behind schedule and over budget.<br>What is truly terrifying is that these problems are only just occurring to to the out of touch millionaires at the DWP. Almost any housing or social worker could have warned them about the problems which will face refuges and homeless hostels when Universal Credit goes ahead. Iain Duncan Smith has spent years plotting welfare reform yet even now he doesn't seem to have any understanding of how the system he's reforming actually works.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19649306\" title=\"\">Poor pupils 'lose out on funding'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074685/youth-offending-teams-lose-800-posts\" title=\"\">Youth offending teams lose more than 800 posts</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/13396/micro_finance_is_not_risk-free_study_concludes\" title=\"\">Micro-finance can make the poorest poorer, study warns</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2012/09/19/118538/mid-staffordshire-inquiry-report-delayed-until-next-year.html\" title=\"\">Mid Staffordshire inquiry report delayed until next year</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-bristol-pound-is-launched-to-help-independent-retailers-8157379.html\" title=\"\">The Bristol Pound is launched to help independent retailers</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/development/campaigners-force-judicial-review-of-hmr-fund/6523812.article\" title=\"\">Campaigners force judicial review of HMR fund</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106969\" title=\"\">Study warns elderly are excluded from decision making</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/pickles-confirms-newman-as-audit-commission-chair/\" title=\"\">Pickles confirms Newman as Audit Commission chair</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9554790/Maternity-units-must-be-closed-to-make-childbirth-safer-report-says.html\" title=\"\">Maternity units must be closed to make childbirth safer, report says</a></p> <p>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Acevo and Navca want more joint working between small and large charities</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Technology companies could be given a fast track to the London Stock Exchange (LSE) under new regulations being proposed by the government to try to snare the would-be Googles and Facebooks of the future.</p> <p>David Willetts, the minister for universities and science, said that the government has been working with the LSE to propose a \"new route\" for companies from the UK and the rest of Europe to raise cash on the stock market. Among the changes will be reformed rules concerning eligibility, reporting and the \"free float\" \u2013 the proportion of shares held by investors that can be traded.</p> <p>Willetts told an audience of venture capitalists and startup entrepreneurs in London that the government was determined to make sure that as many of the new crop of innovative European hi-tech companies seeking to float in the next few years do so in the UK.</p> <p>Although London already offers the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) as a sub-market of the LSE, a number of companies and investors feel that it does not have the prestige of a listing on the main index. The AIM is a self-regulated market with low admission requirements, but it has been criticised for having a \"casino\" environment for trading.</p> <p>Willetts said that the reformed rules being proposed \"will ensure that the needs of dynamic businesses \u2013 particularly internet and technology companies \u2013 and their investors are met\".</p> <p>Research by the independent analysis and investment organisation Nesta suggests that, between 2006 and 2009, more than 800 companies received investment from UK venture capital funds and 2,700 companies received investment from European funds. In all, 10% of firms that received investment from UK or European funds between 1990 and 2005 went on to make an initial public offering.</p> <p>Willetts said the proposals would be aimed at mid-sized, high-growth businesses, which are currently under-represented on the UK's stock markets. Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the LSE, said: \"There is a direct and proven link between IPOs and job creation. Attracting both entrepreneurial businesses and the investors that support them to the UK is key to driving growth and generating jobs.\"</p> <p>Neil Rimer of the venture capital company Index Ventures said: \"It's great news for entrepreneurs everywhere that London is stepping up and not just being a great place to start a company but to build huge sustainable businesses. Our hope is that today's good news from Downing Street will encourage more high-growth companies created in Europe to go big and stay home.\"</p> <p>For venture capital companies, an easier route for companies in which they have invested to float on the stock market, and hence repay their capital, would be a boon \u2014 and could lead to a virtuous circle in which venture capital is more quickly and possibly better rewarded than at present. A constant complaint from UK-based startups is that it is difficult to access venture capital, while the investors complain that it is hard to find companies with sufficiently clear paths to a flotation that would bring a payback.</p> <p>Willetts's move follows lobbying by both startups and investors, and concern that the US could prove a more attractive location for flotation, especially after President Obama lowered the regulatory burden for growth companies wanting to gain listings on US public markets.</p> <p>The government says it will also investigate whether current regulatory rules are putting investors off funding growth companies, and will work with the LSE to widen the availability of equity capital for both UK and international businesses looking to make the UK their global base.</p> <p>Stefan Glaenzer, co-founder of Passion Capital, said: \"This is great news for technology entrepreneurs and investors across Europe. It's vital that we enable more European companies to IPO in London, as this will not only create vital new jobs and investment, but it will also help more European companies grow into world-beaters. We need to create digital companies who end up on the buy side and not sell out. An IPO is not a sellout, it's the beginning of the next phase.\"</p> <p>Reshma Sehoni of Seedcamp said: \"Seedcamp and others have done a lot of work to support early stage tech companies in Europe. It's great news that the government is announcing these proposals to make it more attractive for technology companies to IPO in London. The quality of the entire business ecosystem will improve if the UK remains globally competitive, and particularly so with the US, so that we retain more of our best tech companies and all the jobs and revenues that they create.\"</p>",
  "<p>Spending on maternal and child health has stalled, according to an expert analysis, raising concerns that efforts to cut deaths in poor countries to meet the millennium development goals (MDGs) may falter.</p> <p>Figures from the <a href=\"http://www.countdown2015mnch.org/\" title=\"\">Countdown to 2015 Group</a>, a World Health Organisation and Unicef collaboration that is tracking progress on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">maternal and child health MDGs</a>, show a <a href=\"http://press.thelancet.com/mchdevelopment.pdf\" title=\"\">downturn in the total amount of overseas development aid</a> earmarked for these goals between 2009 and 2010 \u2013 the latest year for which there is data.</p> <p>\"We have been tracking aid for maternal, newborn and child health since 2003,\" said Justine Hsu, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, first author of the Countdown study published by the Lancet. \"Every year we have seen a steady increase. This is the first time that we have seen a slight decrease, of 0.5%. It is a very slight decrease, but it equates to $32m.\"</p> <p>The increase in funding in the previous year was largely due to a few new donors, says the report. \"The 2008-09 increase, from $5,307m to $6,511m, was partly a result of six new donors in 2009 reporting disbursements and a large increase in contributions from the <a href=\"http://www.gavialliance.org/\" title=\"\">Gavi Alliance</a>,\" it says.</p> <p>Looking at the 74 countries that Countdown prioritises as needing the most help, there is not a drop, but a slight increase, of 2.9%, in funding. But that contrasts with increases of 16% and 20% in 2009 and 2008, respectively.</p> <p>Over the period that Countdown has been tracking, funding for maternal and child health has more than doubled, from $2,566m in 2003, to $6,480m in 2010, reflecting global concern that MDGs 4 and 5 \u2013 to reduce child mortality and improve maternal health \u2013 were the least likely to be reached.</p> <p>But the slowdown will worry campaigners and the wider development community, because maternal and child health now has arguably the highest profile of all issues and would be expected to do better than other areas in attracting funds.</p> <p>\"This initial sign of a levelling off in funding for maternal, newborn and child health is against a backdrop of a slowdown in the rate of increases in total ODA across all sectors in recent years,\" said Hsu. \"The slowdown in the rate of funding increases is worrying, and likely to partly result from the present financial crisis. For many of the countries who receive this aid, having a steady supply of aid is essential if they are to meet international targets for reducing maternal and child mortality. If aid begins to drop or becomes more uncertain, this could have devastating effects on the health \u2013 and survival \u2013 of millions of women and children worldwide.\"</p> <p>Co-author Anne Mills, professor of health economics and policy and vice-director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"This paper demonstrates the critical importance of monitoring flows of money to help ensure that donors deliver on their promises. If funding flows decrease, services will suffer and mortality increase.\"</p>",
  "<p>Imagine it: David Cameron wants to see you. You go to his office. He seems jolly enough and keeps telling you what a good job you've been doing, but a few minutes later you're standing on the pavement with all your stuff in a box. Have you just been fired?</p> <p>If you think it's an easy question to answer, consider the case of Lord Hill, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/shortcuts/2012/sep/17/minister-quit-lord-hill\" title=\"\">decided to resign as education minister</a>. After several cancellations he finally got a meeting with the prime minister, but Cameron was so distracted he didn't understand \u2013 he told Lord Hill to keep up the good work and left for a photo op. The meeting ended inconclusively, with Lord Hill still very much in his job. In fact, he's still in his job; he even survived the reshuffle. Now, if you can't tell whether you've quit or not, how will you know when you've been fired? Fortunately, we can offer ministers this handy checklist:</p> <h2>Have you been sent to the front door, or the back?</h2> <p>According to an anonymous ex-minister who produced an <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/09/sacked-minister-spills-the-reshuffle-beans/\" title=\"\">account of his sacking for the Spectator</a>, being directed to the rear entrance of Number 10 is a sure sign your cards have been marked, even if the PM tells you it's because there are workmen out front. It's more likely he's trying to keep your freshly crestfallen countenance away from the cameras. He's doing you a favour, really.</p> <h2>Is everyone being unusually nice to you?</h2> <p>Another clue. The ex-minister first became suspicious when Cameron's flunkies, normally stand-offish, were \"eerily fawning.\" After the meeting, they'd all disappeared.</p> <h2>Is the PM drinking wine?</h2> <p>He was when he sacked Cheryl Gillan, his former Welsh secretary, <a href=\"http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/politics/joseph-watts/new_details_of_the_reshuffle_sackings_1_1507405\" title=\"\">according to one political blog</a>. Downing Street has denied this, but it's definitely a clue worth looking out for. If you had to fire a load of people, you'd probably drink, too.</p> <h2>Did the PM tell you you're too old?</h2> <p>Apparently he told Caroline Spelman <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/06/david-cameron-drank-wine-spelman-to-old-reshuffe_n_1861087.html\" title=\"\">she was too old</a> \u2013 at 54 \u2013 to carry on as environment secretary, before replacing her with Owen Paterson, 56. So clearly it wasn't the real reason; perhaps it was just the nicest thing he could think to say.</p> <h2>Is he going on and on about all the people he's got to please?</h2> <p>Cameron told the Speccie's anonymous ex-minister: \"There's actually 303 someone elses and I've got to keep them all satisfied.\" If you haven't made the PM's \"Top 303 People I Must Keep Satisfied\" list, chances are you're history.</p> <h2>Does your name still appear on the departmental website?</h2> <p>If you've been fired, your name will be removed within hours, if not minutes. The same goes for your office door, so check that too. If you can still get past security.</p> <h2>Have you been left feeling bemused, hurt, depressed and unsure what to do next?</h2> <p>Don't panic: you may still be employed. Remember Lord Hill.</p>",

  "<p><strong>What inspired you to write this parallel Moby-Dick?</strong></p> <p>A silly joke. The joke of Moby-Dick, except with moles instead of whales. I thought of that, and it made me laugh. Of course there's nothing new about retelling Moby-Dick with other beasts - there have been dragon Moby-Dicks, dust monster Moby-Dicks, flying monster Moby-Dicks, etc etc. I liked the idea of the mole, though, because moles are such lovely and - in my head - adorable animals, and the necessary translation or mistranslation of them into what I wanted - enormous, astounding, epic terrors - was a big ask, which I thought might be enjoyable. For me, though, though I don't mind pegging a story on a joke, having decided to write it, I want to treat it as seriously as possible, So while I hope there are genuinely funny bits in the book, I didn't want to make the whole thing just a gag, I wanted to quickly forget how absurd the idea was - though it is absurd and that was part of the whole point - and start to treat it as if it was epic. That's a game I enjoy. I also didn't want to write something that was just a parallel - I know some people like them, but I don't overmuch enjoy stories that exactly point-for-point retell other stories. So I knew I wanted Moby-Dick to be a peg, an inspiration, a riff, an echo, but for my story to wander off and do very different things. (Visiting Robert Louis Stevenson, Daniel Defoe, Joan Aiken, and lots of other writers on the way.)</p> <p><strong>Which character from Railsea do you identify most with?</strong></p> <p>The one I would most like to be like is Caldera. The one I fear I am most like is Sham at the start. </p> <p><strong>If you could be trapped on a desert island in the middle of the Railsea, with any of the characters, who would you choose and why? Personally, I would choose to be trapped with the twins, Caldera and Caldero, because they are resourceful and determined, while are also likely to be able to fashion together some sort of craft out of salvage, using the skills their parents taught them, allowing us to escape.</strong></p> <p>I think your answer is very persuasive. For overlapping reasons, I would probably choose Sirocco. She is not as admirable or as inventive as the Shroakes, but I like her swagger, and I think she would be entertainingly foul-mouthed if annoyed.</p> <p><strong>On p8 of Railsea you write, \"Lights winked in her bulky, composite left arm. It's metal &amp; ivory clicked &amp; twitched\". Was Railsea influenced by the steampunk movement and was it your intention to appeal to a steampunk audience or was it merely coincidence?</strong></p> <p>I'm sure the book was influenced by steampunk, but at least at a conscious level I wanted it very much not to be a steampunk book. It is no coincidence that the train itself is not a steam train. That there are electric trains, hand-powered trains, and so on, as well as the now culturally ubiquitous steam-engines. I wanted it to be a world in which there was more of a patchwork of technology than a Victorian-era level of technology, even a fantasticated and imaginary one. I like to think of this as a salvagepunk book, rather than a steampunk one. </p> <p><strong>In Railsea, on page 143, you explore \"&amp;\", and its relationship with the Railsea itself. What inspired you to include this? Why did you wait until Chapter 33 to explain why you used the symbol &amp; instead of the word \"and\"?</strong></p> <p>I love ampersands, which is the utterly beautiful name for those utterly beautiful \"&amp;\" signs, and I always have. I love their sweep and height, I love that such a tiny word has such a splendidly rococo alternative, I like everything about them. In addition, I associate them with 18th century maritime narratives - in my mind, ships logs from that time use them in big ink swirls - which I wanted my story to echo off, so it seemed a perfect excuse to use them. I put the \"explanation\" in later, rather than earlier, because I sort of vaguely felt like I knew it might annoy some readers to use the &amp; all the way through, and that to jump in too quickly with an explanation might feel a bit like I was saying \"Look! It's ok! I have a reason! Don't go away!\" which felt a little bit cowardly. I'd rather keep people interested, if I can, even despite their eyes twitching a little at the &amp;-signs (which not everyone's does, of course, some people love them or don't care), and then have an explanation when they've already surrendered to the ampersand. </p> <p><strong>On a recent visit to a 16th century house called East Riddlesdon Hall, I found an early Victorian child's sampler that used the ampersand (&amp;) as a full stop. Have you ever come across this before and do you have any idea why they might have done this?</strong></p> <p>I have never heard of this, and I am quite fascinated. And troubled: my typographical philosophy is being shaken. </p> <p><strong>Within Un Lun Dun, you acknowledge the fact that Neil Gaiman's book, Neverwhere gave you \"indispensable contributions to London's phantasmagoria\". Are there any other specific books \"indispensable\" to the writing of both Un Lun Dun and Railsea?</strong></p> <p>So very many I don't know where to start. Lewis Carroll's Alice books, Joan Aiken's books, especially The Wolves of Willoughby Chase and The Whispering Mountain, Alan Garner's astonishing books, Michael de Larrabeiti's Borrible trilogy, Ivor Cutler and Helen Oxenbury's Meal One, Norton Juster's Phantom Tollbooth, Enid Blyton's Faraway Tree books (for all that they make me wince, now), Else Holmelund Minarik's A Kiss for Little Bear (with Sendak's illustrations), the books of Jan Pienkowski, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea books, Tanith Lee's Prince on a White Horse, so...</p> <p><strong>Was it your intention to write a story similar to Neverwhere, but suitable for younger children?</strong></p> <p>With Un Lun Dun? Not deliberately. I think Neverwhere stands quite outstandingly enough on its own that to write a \"version\" of it would be disastrous! I started writing Un Lun Dun before I'd actually read Neverwhere, but when I did read it I realised of course there were strong echoes. I see echoes with lots of books in all my books, some deliberate, some unconscious until later, and as long as that is respectful I think that's great - writing on the shoulders of other writers is a privilege. </p> <p><strong>Did you severely alter your writing style to make your work appeal to children?</strong></p> <p>Not exactly. Every book I write, the first thing I have to do is get into the voice, and the voice varies from book to book - that's part of what's interesting to me. So the voices between, say, Kraken and Embassytown (two of my \"adult\" books) I think varies considerably, and similarly the voice between Un Lun Dun and Railsea. Of course, who you're writing for is part of the decision about the voice of the book, so to that extent, yes, sort of - but the person you're writing for is (sorry to repeat what is a cliche, but it's true) yourself - though yourself at different times and in different moods. So when I wrote Railsea, I was very much wanting to write a story for myself at a certain age. I tried to inhabit the voice that would excite and win over and appeal to and interest that me, rather than thinking \"now to write to appeal to children\". I wouldn't know how - but I do know how to tell younger-me a story he would like, I think and hope. </p> <p><strong>After seeing children's initial response's to Un Lun Dun, did you change your writing style in any other ways when it came to writing Railsea?</strong></p> <p>I'm sure I changed my style - I mean, I think the two books have very different voices - but not in terms of thinking \"this is what readers/children/anyone wants\". I think I would be very bad at second-guessing that, and honestly it's not something I'm wildly excited about or interested in doing. I'm much more interested in writing in a voice that excites me and trying to do it in a way that I can win people over. To that extent - and I'm repeating something I've said before, for which apologies, but occasionally a line comes out of your mouth that is useful enough that you end up recycling it - I don't think my job is to try to give readers what they want; I think my job is to try to make readers want what I give. </p> <p>Of course, I may fail! </p> <p><strong>You seem to have a specific interest in the damage we are doing to the environment and how it is affecting us. (The Smog, Upsky, and the origins of the Railsea). Why is this?</strong></p> <p>Well, the interest is simply that such degradation and despoliation is enormously worrying. There is also something awesome - awful, but awesome - awe-ful - about those ruined landscapes. There is something both dreadful but also compelling about those visions. I don't think I'm alone in this - lots of cultural bits and pieces, while they're sincerely concerned about pollution, say, are also endlessly fascinated with depicting it in amazing, even beautiful ways. Culture often has it both ways like that. All of which said, I think in the context of a story, I'm happy to use these ideas for texture, to give me, and hopefully some readers something to chew on, but they aren't intended to be tracts making political arguments. That wouldn't work. The Smog in Un Lun Dun obviously has something to do, yes, with environmental issues, but within the story, above and beyond all that, it has to be an enjoyable, scary monster. </p> <p><strong>Is it the role of all science fiction writers to be prophetic like HG Wells?</strong></p> <p>I think science fiction is very bad at prediction. That doesn't mean no ideas from SF ever end up, in some complicated, half-accurate, circuitous way finding some kind of reality in the world. Obviously, sometimes that does happen. But far, far, far more of the ideas of SF never turn real, and the ones that do often do so in very misleading ways. None of this is a criticism! I know some people think it is the role of SF to be prophetic: I don't. I think the role of science fiction is not at all to prophecy. I think it is to tell interesting, vivid, strange stories that at their best are dreamlike intense versions and visions of today. </p> <p><strong>You seem to have a fascination with subverting creatures usually considered innocent and harmless into deadly beasts. Is this to try and control and manipulate your readers, taking them out of their comfort zone?</strong></p> <p>Personally, as I was so immersed in the story, it did not initially strike me as odd within the context of the story. I suppose possibly to some extent, but in an ideal world you'd hope you're pushing readers enjoyably out of comfort zones with all sorts of things, not only with the animals. But as one component of that? Certainly! It's also, as I mentioned before, an enjoyment in jokes. Nothing more sophisticated than trying to make something incredibly adorable and cute really scary and either evil or terrifying or both. And, I suppose, there's nothing to preclude vice versa. Perhaps a cuddly pet shark or something might crop up. </p> <p><strong>You also seem to have an interest in the mammoth and the gigantic. Is there a specific reason for this?</strong></p> <p>Doubtless. But I'm often the last to know the reasons behind My Things. In this case, there's something about disobedient scale which is endlessly intoxicating. Not only to me, of course - it's a common bit of brain candy. But it's one to which I am indeed thoroughly addicted. Something about making the normal strange, I think. Tentatively. </p> <p> <br><em><strong>Can we please note, just in case anyone is reading this who might want to come innocent to the books, that the following question contains mild SPOILERS! </strong></em></p> <p><strong>Both Railsea and Un Lun Dun come to satisfying conclusions (eg the happy ever after scenario). Do you plan to continue this approach in future children's books?</strong></p> <p>It would entirely depend on the book. It's certainly not something about which I have a principle in general. I do tend to feel happy and to be enjoying myself when I'm writing books with younger readers - with my younger self - in mind, so maybe that's why, but I'd like to reserve the right to write something thoroughly miserable in that vein, too. Not that I'm in a hurry to, but you never know.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever tempted to end with a cliffhanger or kill off the hero/heroine?</strong></p> <p>Cliffhangers, no. (Though some of my other books some people think end in that unresolved manner. I don't - I think they always reach a resolution, but I can accept there's a reasonable disagreement about it.) The death of a heroine or hero? Certainly, if I felt like it was appropriate for the book. Awful things have happened to some of my protagonists in some of my other books, and might do again. I am terrible at sad films, but I don't dislike sad books in the same way. </p> <p><strong>Who are Indigo and Oscar, the people you have dedicated your children's books to?</strong></p> <p>You are the first person ever to ask me that. Kudos. Indigo is my niece, my sister's daughter. Oscar is the son of a very good friend of mine. </p> <p><strong>Can you tell us what are you working on next?</strong></p> <p>Some short stories, a long novel, some non-fiction, bit of this, bit of that. I know that's really vague, and I apologise if I'm being annoying. I don't mean to be coy - I just get very superstitious about talking about work in progress. It feels like a dreadful hostage to fortune to announce it to the universe while it is still in the process of being formed. It feels like the universe will punish me - and the writing - for my presumption. So I'd rather stay a bit schtum. </p> <p><strong>Are there any plans for an Un Lun Dun film in the near future?</strong></p> <p>We have had some conversations with film-makers at various points, and some people have been excited about the idea, but nothing concrete. I would be happy if something interesting came along, and I'm very open-minded, but I think setting your hopes on film stuff is a good and efficient way to make yourself go crazy, so I attempt to opt out of such aspirations. One day, perhaps, but I wouldn't hold your breath. </p> <p><strong>Lastly I have a suggestion for you, why not write a short story about what the Olympics would be like in Un Lun Dun?</strong></p> <p>This is a startling and excellent idea. Immediately various sporting events are suggesting themselves to me. I am grateful to you for the suggestion. I do ruminate on a return to Deeba and Zanna one day, so who knows?<br> <strong>Thank you so much! </strong></p>",
  "<p>Deprive your body of water and you'll be dead within a week. The survival rate is similar for some of the largest industries equally dependent on water to grow food and make goods such as jeans, beverages, electric power, homes, chemicals and even computer chips.</p> <p>While many people depend on these products, at the same time, many local communities are competing with manufacturers for limited water resources. For example, the computer chip maker Intel estimates it takes 16 gallons of water to produce a single chip, which explains its huge appetite for water in 2011: some 8.3bn gallons from local water systems. Comparatively, the average American uses about 100 gallons of water each day; the average African just five gallons.</p> <p>Competition for water is only expected to increase, as highlighted recently at the World Water Week conference. For companies in these water intensive industries, addressing these competing demands and implementing an effective water management strategy has become essential.</p> <p>At Intel, an increased focus on environmental issues came in the 1990s, as the computer industry grew rapidly. Since then, while their consumption of water has increased each year, so have their efforts to reduce the impact to local communities, according to Todd Brady, the company's global environmental manager.</p> <p>For these efforts, in 2007, the US Environmental Protection Agency recognised the company as a water efficiency leader. And by 2011, some 80% of the water it used was recycled and sent back to local water systems, where it was used for irrigation, in other industrial purposes, or for drinking water. This journey, according to Brady, was a process of engaging employees, local communities and industry partners.</p> <p>\"The semi-conductor manufacturing process goes through hundreds of steps,\" Brady explained, \"and in between those steps we have to rinse off the surface of the wafer with ultra-pure water.\" When searching for ways to reduce and reuse the water used in this process, one of the first places Intel looks is inside, soliciting ideas from the engineers who are closest to the manufacturing process.</p> <p>Intel encourages employees to come forward with ideas on conserving resources, and then matches the best ideas with a grant to develop them. \"We thought we would eventually run out of ideas, but the programme is still going strong,\" says Brady. Most of these innovations, he adds, not only save on resources but also money, providing a payback in three years or less.</p> <p>Among environmental impacts, water use is a particularly local challenge, more so than greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of which may be several states away, says Brady. To compound this challenge, Intel has located several of its largest fabrication plants in areas that are particularly water-constrained, such as Arizona and Israel.</p> <p>Rather than offer a one-size-fits-all approach, Intel attempts to tailor its water management solutions for each municipality in which it operates. \"We engage with the community and the water districts early on to understand their needs, discuss our needs and find solutions that work for both of us,\" he says.</p> <p>At the Israel location, for example, working with the local government, Intel was able to change some of the chemicals used in its manufacturing so the water from this process could be treated and reused for irrigation on local farms.</p> <p>The company has also learned to be as transparent as possible. \"By opening your books to what you are doing, you build trust. Otherwise there is suspicion and mistrust,\" says Brady.</p> <p>Disclosing environmental data in annual CSR reports is good, but offering real-time information is better. The company is now building up its <a href=\"http://exploreintel.com/\" title=\"\">exploreintel.com</a> website offering real-time breakdowns of emissions, water usage, and other environment impacts on a site-by-site basis.</p> <p>Intel works closely with its competitors through the Semiconductor Industry Association, benchmarking its performance with other companies, sharing best practices, and developing tools to better measure water use. As Brady puts it, \"we look at environmental issues as non-competitive\".</p> <p>Earlier this year, Intel collaborated with engineering firm CH2M Hill and Arizona State University to help develop the website <a href=\"http://www.ch2mhill.com/watermatch/home/\" title=\"\">WaterMatch</a>. The idea is to maximise the reuse of so-called \"greywater\". This is wastewater that can be treated and reused for industrial or agricultural purposes, but not for drinking water.</p> <p>The website, which is free to use, will match entities that have excess wastewater, like water treatment plants, with those that can use it in lieu of taking fresh water from local supplies. CH2M Hill showcased the website at World Water Week.</p> <p>Intel has made steady progress to conserve the amount of water used in its manufacturing. Still, the company failed to meet its most recent goal to cut the water required per chip below 2008 levels by year-end 2011. The challenge, says Brady, is the pace of technical innovation and the increasing complexity of the products each year. As you pack more transistors on the chip, you increase the number of steps that use water to rinse and clean the chip, he explains.</p> <p>The takeaway here for Intel and others, he says: \"You must be proactive, be strategic in your thinking. You can't just look at issues year-to-year. You must consider where your business and products are going over the next decade and how you can intercept that to achieve the goals you've set.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Fans of superhero epic<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\"> The Avengers</a> have expressed their outrage at studio Disney's decision to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B00742SZEU/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1\" title=\"\">release the home video version in Britain</a> without the director's commentary and other extras.</p> <p>Purchasers of the new DVD and Blu-Ray release of the blockbuster comic book movie took to Amazon to chastise the Hollywood studio, with some threatening to return their copies of the film. Others said they would not be buying the current edition.</p> <p>\"Was fully intending to get this until I noticed that all the special features have been cut out,\" wrote one commenter on the retailer's UK site. \"Way to go Marvel/Disney. Why release something like this \u2013 a disk that was going to sell insane numbers \u2013 and waste the opportunity by gutting it? All you're doing is p****** people off. No way I'll be buying this, might try and import the US release.\"</p> <p>Another user wrote: \"Despite the significantly higher premium over DVD, this Blu-Ray offers zero extras, not because they're not available or won't fit on the disc, but because Disney know many individuals will have been waiting for this disc and will pre-order, unaware of the omissions, and of course Disney will then release a \"Special Edition\" including everything they should include now.\"</p> <p>In all, the <a href=\"http://www.homecinemachoice.com/news/article/marvel%E2%80%99s-avengers-assemble-blu-ray-censorship-row-disney-uk-speaks-out/13225\" title=\"\">home video release's page</a> features 117 one-star reviews out of a total of 258 at time of writing. Disney UK spokesman Lydia Rodrigues told Home Video Choice the omission of the commentary was unfortunate. \"That was a bit of a disappointment,\" she said. \"Our DLT (Digital Linear Tape, required to replicate the disc) had to be delivered one month earlier than that required for the US pressing. So we missed out. We wanted it too.\"</p> <p>The UK release also features a different shot of a key death scene, reportedly the result of an error in production.</p> <p>\"Thanks to those of you who have let us know about an issue on the Marvel Avengers Assemble UK Blu-Ray and DVD release, which has a less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki,\" said Disney in a statement. \"Each country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release which minimally altered this scene in the film. We thank our fans for their vigilance in recognising this and apologise for the mix up.\"</p> <p>Disney has even taken the unusual step of suggesting that fans purchase the US Blu-Ray of the film, which should work on UK players. \"We know that hardcore fans with Blu-ray players are probably going to end up buying the US release, which has the commentary,\" <a href=\"http://www.homecinemachoice.com/news/article/disney-confesses-to-cocking-up-uk-avengers-blu-ray-and-dvd-release/13239\" title=\"\">Rodrigues told Home Cinema Choice</a>. \"The American Blu-Ray is region-free.\"</p> <p>The Avengers took more than $1.5bn at the global box office earlier this year, making it easily 2012's highest grossing film. It also stands as the third highest-grossing film of all time behind the James Cameron films Avatar and Titanic. In the UK, it took some \u00a349m, making it the second biggest of the year after The Dark Knight Rises.</p>",
  "<p>That the last of the non-avian dinosaurs died out some 65.5 million years ago is not controversial. That this occurred largely owing to a dirty great asteroid smashing into the sea off of Mexico is also not in doubt. What remains the subject of much discussion, however, is why they went and other animals did not, or, more specifically, how do you survive a mass extinction?</p> <p>First off, the elephant in the room: luck. Often overlooked, this can play a major role. Zoos aside, all lemurs live in Madagascar, if the island was struck by a meteor tomorrow they'd all be gone instantly regardless of how well equipped they might normally be to survive such a catastrophe. It's easy enough to think of similar examples and certainly at least some groups would be doomed from such an event simply because of where they were. And on the flipside of this, some theoretically very vulnerable creatures could survive such an event by being lucky enough to live in a place untouched by it. </p> <p>Still, there are a lot of characteristics that seem to help certain animals survive mass extinctions. We can work these out by looking at what groups tend to survive global mass extinctions (or even more local ones in the modern world) and seeing what they have in common. Obviously, there will be exceptions and outliers, but as rules of thumb, the following features are the kinds of things that will help a group or species survive a major extinction event.</p> <p>Be small. If you're small you probably have a large population and thus a wider genetic diversity. Small creatures also reproduce faster than large ones allowing for rapid evolution and adaption to new conditions. And of course a small animal doesn't require as much food or resources to keep going (you can feed a lot of mice for what it'd take to keep a single elephant alive).</p> <p>Have lots of offspring. As above, having a lot of variation will help evolution along and make it more likely some will survive so pumping out the kids will help. Possums are about the same size as domestic cats but have twice as many young per litter, for example.</p> <p>Be a generalist. If you have only one source of food, or need a specific plant to shelter in, then you're doomed if that is affected or taken out. But if you can eat more or less anything that comes your way, you have a greater chance of being able to find enough to keep going through the bad times or be able to move into a new environment and survive.</p> <p>Be wide ranging. Similar to the above point, if the species has a global distribution, some are likely to reside in a spot that's largely unaffected by the crisis. If you already inhabit multiple habitats, then some will likely be less affected or you can move from one to another.</p> <p>Be free to move. An animal that can move freely will do well \u2013 it can escape the prevailing conditions and carry on. If the arctic was wiped out tomorrow, there are birds and whales that could move to the Antarctic and better conditions within days.</p> <p>Be good at surviving stress. Animals used to going for long periods without food or water (like many reptiles or hibernating mammals), or have burrows, are likely to do better than those that require copious clean water, or can only survive a few hours in the wrong temperatures.</p> <p>Put this together and it should be clear that many fish, for example, would tend to be OK in the long run if there was a disaster tomorrow. Living in water gives them an equable environment that is sheltered from change, they can move around long distances freely, often have huge populations, breed rapidly with large numbers of offspring, can eat a variety of prey, and don't require that much food. On the other hand, African rhinos, say, are large, need a lot of food, don't have a big population, breed only slowly, live in only a few tropical places and would struggle to get out of Africa and move north (or south for that matter).</p> <p>Of course all the vagaries of a global disaster and quite which environments would and would not be affected and to what degree are impossible to determine in the fossil record. However, it's because we do have an understanding of extinction survival that makes the extinction of the dinosaurs something of a mystery in the context of what did and didn't survive. It's perhaps no surprise that the giant sauropods went with their huge size and vast food requirements and relatively long generation times. On the other hand it's rather a surprise how well the amphibians did \u2013 as we are sadly seeing at the moment, they seem very vulnerable to changes in water quality and the like and are in low numbers outside of the tropics and can't cross the sea or large stretches of dry land. The real surprise of course (when looking at this coarse level of scrutiny) is that some of the small and feathered dinosaurs died out as did some early birds, when some other bird lineages survived. They were so similar in so many ways as far as we can tell \u2013 they were small, lived in similar environments, had similar reproductive strategies and the like. Perhaps it was simply luck \u2013 some birds were doing well in a location that happened to survive relatively unscathed from the impact and subsequent fallout, or were already a little better adapted to the incoming conditions. </p> <p>Such research is important as it allows us to predict which groups might need special protection as a result of the ongoing global extinction that afflicts the planet now. Resources are sadly scarce, but an understanding of what ecosystems and which species are likely to be most vulnerable from what we can see from previous global extinctions (that which killed the non-avian dinosaurs is not the only one life on Earth has suffered, merely the most recent) does have an impact on our planning. Palaeontology is a study of the past, but it can certainly provide data for the present and the future.</p>",
  "<p>The Olympics discouraged shoppers from buying online in August as they switched to the high street, the Office for National Statistics has said.</p> <p>But the revived enthusiasm for the shops failed to lift sales volumes, which fell 0.2% on July.</p> <p>The high street benefited from a surge in the sale of sporting goods and toys, much of it related to the Mo Farah effect and the success of Team GB, combined with shirt sales ahead of the football season.</p> <p>The ONS said a 2.7% rise in overall sales since August 2011 had failed to significantly alter the picture for a sector that has flatlined over the last couple of years.</p> <p>Nevertheless, retail sales were still up 0.6% in the three months to August compared to the three months to May, which reinforces the view of many economists that the much-anticipated figures for third quarter GDP will show a rise after three quarters of falls.</p> <p>David Tinsley, UK economist at the investment bank BNP Paribas, said the decline in retail sales was disappointing, but \"with the Olympics distracting shoppers over that month, the fall could, on balance, have been much worse\".</p> <p>Excluding fuel, sales fell 0.3% on the previous month, the ONS said.</p> <p>Food sales saw an increase, along with clothing and footwear, which saw sales rise 1.6%. But this was offset by a 2.7% fall in household goods sales and a 6.7% drop in internet purchases.</p> <p>The fall in household goods was accompanied by a 4% fall in mortgage approvals, the Council for Mortgage Lenders said in a separate survey.</p> <p>The sale of household goods is closely linked to the housing market, which has been depressed for the last four years with transactions running at half the levels they were before the crisis.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, was gloomy about the outlook for the consumer over the coming months. \"Hopes that the squeeze on consumers' purchasing power would ease markedly further over the latter months of 2012 are waning. In particular, a move back up in petrol prices, rising utility bills and the possibility of higher food prices (partly due to the drought in the US) will limit any further falls in consumer price inflation in the near term and could even see it move back up.\"</p> <p>He said muted wage growth and tighter fiscal policy was adding to the squeeze on consumers, many of whom needed to cut debts; and unemployment remained relatively high, with many of the recent job gains being in low-paid or part-time work, or self-employment.</p>",
  "<h2>Thursday's best bets, by Will Hayler</h2> <p>Ayr's feature Flat racing meeting of the year has started with disappointment after overnight rain forced the abandonment of Thursday's card.</p> <p>An inspection has been called at 630am for Friday's card and the betting on Betfair as to whether the meeting will go ahead or not suggests that the chance is roughly 50/50.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at Kempton on Wednesday Richard Hughes effectively put an end to the jockeys' championship by riding a treble, taking his tally on the day to six winners. That extended his lead over the sidelined Ryan Moore to 34 and it's now hard not to see how Hughes won't have the title dead and buried by the end of this month, effectively meaning that he won't have to trawl around the all-weather tracks when the number of turf fixtures starts to trail off.</p> <p>Hughes is double heading again today, tackling Yarmouth and Kempton. <strong>Van Der Neer (2.20)</strong>, an interesting Richard Hannon-trained newcomer in the opener at Yarmouth, could be his best chance at the first track.</p> <p><strong>Flow (2.50)</strong> has some interesting newcomers in opposition in his one-mile maiden, but I fancy he will prove up to whatever is thrown at him. Very green at Epsom on his debut, he again met with defeat when well fancied at Leicester subsequently, but the form of that race is working out very well with the winner placed in Listed company since and the well-held third easily winning his maiden next time out.</p> <p>Given the improvement he showed from his first to his second start, there is every reason to expect even more here and he could well win this on his way to taking up his entry in the Racing Post Trophy.</p> <p><strong>Jawaab (4.30)</strong> has some useful old form in the book and the fitting of a visor and a switch of stable appears to have rekindled his flame. He could prove worth a small bet at Pontefract.</p> <p>I will be at Kempton to watch his stablemate <strong>Goldan Jess (7.40)</strong>, in whom a great deal of time, patience and money has been invested by my fellow owners and I. It's years since we last tasted the sweet milk of success with him, but the problems with his legs now finally seem to be in the past and we head to the races hopeful of a more encouraging showing.</p> <p>During the bleak couple of years where we have had to wait for nature to heal his injuries, we were only able to dream of getting him back to the track, so in some sense even to have him running tonight will be mission accomplished. But if he finishes in the first six, you'll find me in the bar bouncing with excitement.</p> <h2>Tipping competition - day four</h2> <p>An impressive treble from JayGee1, who found all three winners at juicy prices (7-1, 15-2 and 11-1), was not quite enough to see him hit the front with a number of you finding at least one of the trio.

  "<p>Man-made English salt marshes are failing to meet European conservation regulations that stipulate they should be as rich in plant life as natural wetlands, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02198.x/abstract\" title=\"\">a new study warned on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>Salt marshes are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides, and are found all around the coastline of Great Britain. They are important ecosystems that provide essential food, refuge or habitat for fish, invertebrates and birds. The flowering plants that live there are very specialised, as only a few species can tolerate the salty conditions.</p> <p>Scientists from the University of East Anglia (UEA) compared the vegetation of 18 marshes created as part of man-made changes to the coastline since 1991, and 17 marshes created accidentally by storm surges since 1881, with 34 natural salt marsh sites in the UK.</p> <p>They found that the artificially created salt marshes suffered significantly reduced biodiversity. Characteristic perennial plants such as sea lavender (<em>Limonium vulgare</em>), sea thrift (<em>Armeria maritima</em>), sea arrowgrass (<em>Triglochin maritima</em>) and sea plantain (<em>Plantago maritima</em>) were very poorly represented, while shrubs such as sea purslane (<em>Atriplex portulacoides</em>) were becoming dominant..</p> <p>Under the EU habitats directive, new salt marsh must be created every time natural salt marsh is lost to coastal development or erosion caused by sea-level rise. New marshes must display \"equivalent biological characteristics\" to their natural counterparts.</p> <p>Man-made salt marshes in south England have been created by relocating sea walls inland and breaching the old, outer walls to let the sea to flood in, creating a marsh. Many accidentally created salt marshes have formed when old sea walls collapsed and let in the sea.</p> <p>While salt-tolerant (halophytic) flowering plants colonised artificially created salt marsh rapidly, the composition of these marshes was \"significantly different\" to natural marshes.</p> <p>Sediment conditions in lower-lying areas were less oxygenated than those at the same elevation in natural marshes, the study said, and man-made marshes tended to be drier. The artificial sites tended to be flat and featureless with scrappy vegetation and patches of bare ground.</p> <p>\"It is clear from our work that marshes reactivated by managed realignment do not provide habitats and species in comparable proportions to natural marshes and do not have equivalent biological characteristics. They therefore do not satisfy the requirements of the EU habitats directive,\" said the report, published in the journal of Applied Ecology.</p> <p>Lead author Hannah Mossman, of UEA's school of environmental sciences, said: \"Salt marshes such as those in north Norfolk, Essex and around much of the coast of England are loved by naturalists and tourists alike for their natural beauty plus their rare and rich ecology.</p> <p>\"These unique tidal areas also provide vital habitat for invertebrates, a staging post for migrant birds, and the only environment in which a number of salt-tolerant plants can survive.\"</p> <p>Saltmarshes protect shorelines from erosion, reduce flooding and protect water quality by filtering runoff. The south of England is naturally subsiding into the sea, and is already experiencing coastal erosion.</p> <p>\"In the face of rising sea levels, managed coastal realignment has become an increasingly important option,\" the study said.</p> <p>The report said conditions of man-made saltmarshes could be improved by additional conservation management such as manipulating the elevation or planting more mid- and upper-marsh species.</p> <p>Saltmarshes and reedbeds are at risk from land reclamation or drainage for agriculture or coastal development \u2013 around 50% of saltmarsh area worldwide has already been lost or degraded.</p> <p>The United Nations Environment Programme has urged greater protection for saltmarshes, sea grasses, mangroves and seaweeds partly because they soak up greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, helping to slow global warming.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/crossrail-earth-wetland-nature-reserve\" title=\"\">construction work began</a> on Europe's largest man-made nature reserve that will transform Wallasea Island in Essex into a 1,500-acre wetland.</p>",
  "<p>Overall sales including fuel fell by 0.2%, giving an annual rise of 2.7%. Online sales were particularly hard hit, according to the Office for National Statistics, but retailers of sporting goods reported strong demand for soccer shirts ahead of the start of the new football season.</p> <h2>James Knightly, ING Bank</h2> <p>UK retail sales for August fell pretty much in line with expectations, dropping 0.2% on the month (-0.3% consensus). [Online sales] fell 6.7% month on month with respondents suggesting they suffered through people watching the Olympics on television rather than surfing the net and making impulse purchases. While today's report does show an overall fall, the reasons behind it are largely down to one-off factors. With employment posting strong gains and inflation edging lower we are hopeful of a return to positive, albeit low, retail sales growth in the next few months.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The August retail sales indicate that for all its many virtues, the Olympic Games appears to have hindered rather than helped retail sales. Looking ahead, it seems likely that retail sales will remain muted overall in the near term at least. Consumers still face serious headwinds that are limiting their willingness as well as their ability to spend.</p> <h2>David Tinsley, BNP Paribas</h2> <p>We would not interpret the fall in sales in the release as being too bad a result. The British Retail Consortium and CBI surveys on the retail sector had already suggested a possibly worse decline and the impact of the Olympics might, on anecdote, have been expected to have depressed sales even more. Indeed the three-month on three-month rise in retail sales excluding fuel is still a very pleasing 1.0%, while including fuel still leaves it at 0.6%. The level of retail sales is still hovering around considerably higher levels that it averaged in 2011, indicating there has been some more momentum to consumer spending recently.</p> <h2>Ross Walker, RBS</h2> <p>Overall demand is still soft, but the retail industry is still holding up. We can expect positive growth in the third quarter. Insofar as it tells us about broader household spending, perhaps it's instructive, people are still feeling the pinch.</p>",

  "<p>We know how challenging the role of a frontline children's social worker is. We also know that social workers have an enormous impact on the lives of children and young people \u2013 often a life changing one.</p> <p>In 2010, a regional survey showed that while Central Bedfordshire had the lowest profile in the region among social workers \u2013 despite being the largest unitary authority \u2013 we topped the job satisfaction league for people who already work here. The question then was, how could we get the message out to others that this is a great place to live and work?</p> <p>No one could disagree that employing qualified, committed and enthusiastic staff is a sound investment. So this year we commissioned HR company <a href=\"http://www.penna.com/\" title=\"\">Penna</a> to work with us on a campaign to reach out to social workers and the concept of \"love your job again\" was born.</p> <p>The campaign is primarily <a href=\"http://www.loveyourjobagain.com/\" title=\"\">internet based</a> and features unscripted videos with three of our staff and also lots of supportive quotes from other employees about why they enjoy working here. We are also placing adverts in the trade press, which reflect the look and feel of the website.</p> <p>The majority of social workers do love their work, but recent high profile cases and the perceived level of red tape and target setting has certainly had an effect on both their professional and personal lives. The campaign has encouraged us to emphasise what social workers do best and to build on the recommendations of the <a href=\"http://www.safeguardingchildrenea.co.uk/summary_and_download_of_final_munro_report\" title=\"\">Munro report on child protection</a>.</p> <p>We focused on those things which made our social workers choose the career in the first place: wanting to make a difference, helping children to stay safe and the chance to reach their professional potential. We used current staff to get the message across that our children's services teams are friendly and supportive and that there's always someone around to talk things through with.</p> <p>We also realised that in addition to an open, honest environment, it's essential to offer career progression and training. Our newly qualified staff tell us they are well supported with excellent training opportunities, delivered by nationally recognised trainers.</p> <p>You rarely see a news story about good social work and we know we won't read about good decisions our social workers have made, or how they have gone above and beyond to make a difference. So we work hard to ensure that staff are recognised for their dedication in house.</p> <p>To date the campaign has been positive; we've had a good response and recruited some great new people. But we're still on the lookout for more, especially experienced social workers looking for a new challenge. We have shown that we can help our staff \"love their job again\".</p> <p><em>Yolanda Corden is interim assistant director of operations for children's services at </em><a href=\"http://www.centralbedfordshire.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Central Bedfordshire council</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Predictably, the government is now fretting that in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jun/23/government-confirms-it-is-to-scap-coi?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">taking a chainsaw</a> to Whitehall communications and PR it lopped off its own lower limbs. In what already feels like the pre-election season, the Cabinet Office is now revamping and <a href=\"http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1148369/Government-comms-spend-set-significant-upswing/\" title=\"\">regenerating its communications capacity</a>.</p> <p>Ministers, especially the prime minister, are anxious about polls and public antipathy. Like their predecessors, they believe that the remedy is employing more spinners and marketeers \u2013 but may, unlike their predecessors, instinctively prefer what agencies such as <a href=\"http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/suppliers/hill-knowlton-ltd\" title=\"\">Hill &amp; Knowlton</a>, <a href=\"http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/suppliers/grayling\" title=\"\">Grayling</a> or <a href=\"http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/suppliers/daniel-j-edelman-ltd\" title=\"\">Edelman</a> can bring them, rather than civil servants.</p> <p>This means that over the next couple of years, the thing to watch will be total Whitehall PR spend, not just headcount. Typically, no one in the Cabinet Office or Treasury has chosen to count these pennies.</p> <p>The new Whitehall PR <a href=\"https://gcn.civilservice.gov.uk/about/proactive-communication-plan-201213/\" title=\"\">plan</a>, though in many respects a remarkable innovation, is uninformative about resources. The official comms budget for 2012-13 is given as \u00a3285m, which \u2013 as PR Week <a href=\"http://www.prweek.com/uk/bulletin/prweekukdaily/article/1148369/government-comms-spend-set-significant-upswing/\" title=\"\">pointed out</a> \u2013 is a 70% increase on spending under the auspices of the Central Office of Information in 2011-12.</p> <p>But if the two figures are not comparable, as the Cabinet Office protests, that's partly because the COI's co-ordinating role was scrapped when it was consigned to the pyre of quangos.</p> <p>What's happening now is interesting \u2013 but below the radar. Contracts are being let to private agencies in greater number, yes, but jobs in Whitehall PR are also recovering from their low point. The Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, for instance, is recruiting two senior people to do internal comms and stakeholder relations.</p> <p>Similarly, \"marketing\", once banned by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude (the efficiency and reform group in 2010 forbade departments erecting stands at trade fairs and conferences), is now extolled as a legitimate object of activity by communications staff.</p> <p>The new PR plan is ambitious. It wants to toughen up the regime introduced in April grouping comms work into seven hubs in which, for example, the Department of Work and Pensions and HM Revenue &amp; Customs, with their arm's length bodies, <a href=\"https://gcn.civilservice.gov.uk/dwp-hmrc-including-their-albs-and-other-hub-organisations/\" title=\"\">share common PR and marketing services</a>. Unfortunately, the hubs exist only on paper and the plan <a href=\"https://gcn.civilservice.gov.uk/embedding-the-new-approach/\" title=\"\">ruefully notes </a>that \"staff resource is still largely deployed in silo fashion\".</p> <p>The plan was signed off by Jenny Grey, head of the <a href=\"https://gcn.civilservice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Government Communication Network</a> who is just about to leave, to take up a private sector PR job. Who is going to bang heads together and enforce co-ordination? On past evidence it is unlikely that David Cameron's newly appointed ministers will meekly say they don't care much about PR (unlike any of their predecessors) and happily share their press officers with their deadly rival next door.</p> <p>Grey (who was my predecessor as director of communications at the Audit Commission) won her reputation as a deliverer of downsizing. But she has been no more able than any predecessor to solve the mystery of the Bermuda triangle at the heart of Whitehall, the relationship between Number 10, Cabinet Office and Treasury and their respective ministers and spin doctors.</p> <p>George Osborne's advisers are not going to submit to planning attempts by the Cabinet Office. Because of Tony Blair's personal dominance after 1997, his hatchet man Alastair Campbell was able to pull departmental comms people into line, except those at the Treasury, who served Gordon Brown first.</p> <p>The plan talks about the new media environment as if it is a one-way street, with government using Facebook and digital media to get its point across. Isn't it also about government interacting with social media, which could be subversive of civil service ways of working?</p> <p>Government press officers tell themselves they are serving the public interest, conducting campaigns (much emphasised in this plan) for smoking cessation and the like. In fact they are serving ministers.</p> <p>In \"explaining the wider choice offered by free schools\", press officers are actually trying to deliver a highly contentious and partisan policy dreamt up by education secretary Michael Gove. Gove has more than one of those and is in a hurry to sell them. His colleagues similarly.</p> <p>For that reason alone, we could confidently predict a mini-boom in Whitehall PR employment over the next two years.</p> <p><em>David Walker is contributing editor to the Public Leaders Network and is a former director of communications at the Audit Commission</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Data is everywhere: from governments publishing billions of bytes of the stuff, to visual artists creating new concepts of the world through to companies building businesses on the back of it. </p> <p>And everyone wants to be a data journalist too - the barriers for entry have never been lower as free tools change the rules on who can analyse, visualise and present data. Truly, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/may/24/data-journalism-punk\">anyone can do it</a>.</p> <p>At the same time, journalism has undergone a transformation; it's not that long ago that the only way to get a story published by a major news organisation involved years of training and interning and generally slaving away until you get noticed and published. Now, the power has shifted and the days when journalists could shut themselves away from the world in order to hand out gems of beautiful writing have well and truly vanished. </p> <p>These are the days of open journalism, reporters who can use the power of the web can produce stronger, better stories. Open journalism involves the person reading and commenting on the story as much as the original reporter, and with the power to shape and influence the news they see in front of them. </p> <p>But how does that connect to data journalism? These are two segments of the same pie chart - and for data journalism to develop beyond just being the latest fad, it has to engage and involve the people reading the news as well as creating it. </p> <p>Data journalism is not (just) about being clever and showing the world how clever you are. It has to be about more than that.</p> <p>It's important because data journalism has its roots in publicly available data. As soon as <a href=\"http://www.data.gov/\">data.gov</a> launched in 2009 it didn't matter how good or bad it was - the principle had been set: all government data must be public, and available in a form you can use. Since then, the world has been deluged in open data, with cities, states and regions around the globe publishing everything from detailed crime statistics to the locations of public toilets.</p> <p>But having an open data portal doesn't automatically make you a haven of freedom - even <a href=\"http://www.data.gov.bh/wps/portal/data/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3hfR08jT0sTI0t_UwsnA0_XMF8jL4sQQwtTE_1wkA6zeAsDE0dDT3cDdwt_HzMDz1B3T_eQUC9DA39TiLwBDuBooO_nkZ-bqh-cWKRfkJ2d5uioqAgAxFw7sA!!/dl3/d3/L0lHSkovd0RNQU5rQUVnQSEhL1lCZncvZW4!/\">Bahrain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.saudi.gov.sa/wps/portal/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3iTMGenYE8TIwODUEsLA89QU69g11A_YwMTQ_3g1Dz9gmxHRQCO1nwy\">Saudi Arabia</a> now have open data portals. As this <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/09/open_data_movement_how_to_keep_information_from_being_politicized_.html\">prescient article by David Eaves in Slate points out</a>. He says</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For many of us who have campaigned for the right to access and reuse government information, it would be easy to pause and relish the sweet victory. We have the ammunition, so now, believe the most techno-utopian advocates, open data will fundamentally change politics\u2014depoliticizing debates and eliminating irresponsible positions. But that would be a mistake.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is where data journalists come in - by exposing and interrogating the data, we can test how accurate it is, mash it up with other datasets to produce results that tell you something new about the news. </p> <p>Because, traditionally journalists have treated data with a kind of breathless trust which they would never accord a human source. Numbers are trusted, because investigating them is too scary. Former BBC reporter Michael Blastland, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7605118.stm\">examined the norovirus - or winter vomiting bug - outbreak of 2008</a>, showing exactly how easy it is to get the numbers wrong. The story was that three million people had gone down the previous year with the disease.</p> <p>He looked at the confidence intervals - the guide to how reliable these numbers were - and realised that the number could just as easily be 280,000. Or even 34 million. The truth of the story was, nobody knew, but the story had been written up anyway.</p> <p>There are historic examples of great journalists adopting data too, of course; <a href=\"http://pmeyer.web.unc.edu/\">Philip Meyer</a>, the US journalist behind the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/dec/09/riot-theory-relative-detroit-england\">Detroit project</a> which inspired our Reading the Riots project - a reporter who used data to create classic new forms of journalism.</p> <p>But this is not a niche form of reporting anymore.</p> <p>The people that seem to care about the numbers are out there in the world: our readers. Arguably most of the million or so people who read the Datablog each month are predominantly general-interest readers; not developers, designers or even other journalists. They want the numbers because they want to trust the report, to test its veracity and sometimes to see what else they can find in the data. </p> <p>Because everyone is an expert in something, that engagement can mean fascinating results - including us <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/apr/13/mapping-colours-open-journalism-storify\">improving our map colours on the blog with the help of our readers</a>.</p> <p>However, plenty of data is still closed, and we in the media are part of this process. Often it's more likely that the data will be alluded to in a story or interactive and you will be kept away from it.</p> <p>It's as if to say: \"look - we made this fantastic interactive guide, you couldn't possibly have anything to offer. So long, and thanks for looking!\"</p> <p>The raw data of key national and international events is often witheld - in favour of snazzy presentations of the information without allowing you access to the data behind it to download for yourself. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jun/21/open-data-election-hack-vote\">Immediate and detailed election data is one example</a>, supplied by paid-for feed and certainly not available for immediate download. Or there's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/london-2012-olympics-open-data\">live Olympic results - you might be able to see an athlete winning a gold before your eyes, but is that raw data available for you to visualise and experiment with?</a> </p> <p>News organisations may be campaigners for open information but by withholding that data, become complicit in a system which essentially keeps data private until it's no longer commercially valuable. It's all very well calling for governments to throw open the doors of their data vaults, but if you are not willing to be open too, what is that worth?</p> <p>Open data assumes the readers are an integral part of the story - open data journalism does the same. By publishing the data in an accessible form, making it available to whoever wants it, suddenly our journalism is stronger and better. So, this is our ten point guide to how it can work:</p> <h2>1. Expose the data behind the story</h2> <p>The best journalism reveals something new about the world - and feels timely and of the moment. Data journalism works when it forces itself into the agenda and makes the news. Timely means people will care about it enough to try and become part of the story.</p> <h2>2. Provide the key data people need</h2> <p>It's a mess out there. As a reader, how can you find the key dataset you need at that moment, data that's not too old or too unreliable. That's where data journalism's role in curating the key numbers can come in. The skills of research are a key part of being a reporter and the editorial role of selecting the key data mean you can help readers find what they're really looking for. Journalists can be the bridge between the providers of data and the consumers - and interpret that data to bring it alive but also to test and check it.</p> <h2>3. Make it personal</h2> <p>All data is personal at some level - and the best interactive and visualisations allow users to see how the numbers reflect their lives where they live. As more and more granular data is released about tiny geographies, by making it personal, we can bring it to life.</p> <h2>4. Anyone can do it</h2> <p>They really can - often it's the skills of knowing that something is a story or not that becomes most important. There are <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9215504/22_free_tools_for_data_visualization_and_analysis\">enough free tools out there</a> to ensure that visualising and analysing the data is simple and easy.</p> <h2>5. Make our data open</h2> <p>What is open data? It is data published in a machine-readable format that anyone can use. That excludes PDFs which are - as <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/stephen-messer\">Stephen Messer</a> says - where data goes to die. By making our data open we mean producing it in a form people can use, whether it's CSV, excel or even <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/RDF/\">RDF</a>.</p> <h2>6. \"Do what you do best, and link to the rest\"</h2> <p><a href=\"http://buzzmachine.com/\">Jeff Jarvis</a> said that and the principle is simple: there's bound to be someone out there doing something amazing - why not be open enough to embrace that?</p> <h2>7. Free data - now</h2> <p>It's not enough to just aggregate data anymore - what about the raw, real-time live data behind everything from public transport to election results.</p> <h2>8. We're not the experts</h2> <p>We can't be experts in every aspect of life - why not try and engage those who are make them part of our process?</p> <h2>9. Make big data accessible</h2> <p>As the datasets that we can explore get bigger, it's our job to make them smaller and simpler to understand.</p> <h2>10.

  "<p>UK independent TV producers have trebled international revenues to \u00a3652m in the past decade, but are shying away from riskier programming and documentaries to focus on factual entertainment formats, according to a study.</p> <p>The report on the UK TV and digital content market, published ahead of a <a href=\"http://cowboysorindies.co.uk/\" title=\"\">conference on Thursday looking at 30 years of the UK independent production sector</a>, observes that the 2003 Communications Act, which shifted ownership of programme rights to independent producers, has \"led to an emphasis on formats\", but a trebling in value of international commissions to \u00a3652m annually.</p> <p>Authored by a group of academics and funded by the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council, the report examined conditions within the independent production sector and relations with the BBC and Channel 4, finding growing pressure to produce formats of commercial value, a shying away from risk and a refocus away from \"blue chip documentary\" to factual entertainment.</p> <p>Increased consolidation, competition, and emphasis on formats and international sales \"can heighten pressure on production budgets, reducing creative freedoms, working conditions, and individual worker's belief in public service broadcasting\", the report found.</p> <p>Tighter programme budgets have helped create a harsh work environment, with a lack of diversity among the workforce, producing \"a very sick sector\", according to the survey, based on 100 interviews and a two-year examination of 100 companies.</p> <p>\"Pay scales are down, working conditions are atrocious, exploitation is massive, training levels have fallen through the floor,\" one of the interviewees said.</p> <p>A significant minority of interviewees thought the constraints of serving UK public service broadcasters such as the BBC and Channel 4 could make it more difficult to sell content abroad.</p> <p>On the other hand, a BBC commissioner said when commissioning shows from independent producers UK broadcasters were \"experiencing tensions all the time\" between the commercial imperatives imposed by international co-financing deals and the public service broadcasting requirements of the corporation. \"There is not always a meeting of minds,\" the interviewee added.</p> <p>The report's overall conclusion is that there is a \"fragile compact\" between the public service broadcasters and the independent sector, and a key recommendation for the imminent review of the 2003 Act by the government is that the terms of trade should not be tipped further in favour of independents.</p> <p>It noted that the BBC and Channel 4 spent \u00a31.36bn on commissions from independent producers last year.</p> <p>The report argues that the obligation on the BBC and Channel 4 to pay for their channels to be distributed by BSkyB and Virgin Media should be removed, and the savings spent on public service digital content. It says the BBC's window of creative competition \u2013 under which independents are guaranteed 25% of qualifying TV commissions and BBC in-house 50%, with the other 25% up for grabs \u2013 should extend to online, and Ofcom should be given a remit to review PSBs' multiplatform strategy.</p> <p>Spending on individual online projects is low and too thinly spread, with \u00a322.7m of public service digital content divided between 386 companies (\u00a358,000 apiece) in 2010/11. The report recommends that Channel 4 should draw up a list of 50 digital suppliers for two thirds of its annual spending, refreshing the list every two or three years.</p> <p>The report, Multiplatforming Public Service Broadcasting: the Economics and Cultural Role of the UK Digital and Television Independents, was authored by Royal Holloway University of London, University of Sussex and London Metropolitan University.</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>A nutrition act and new crops are at the centre of the Malawi government's latest attempts to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/21/malawi-empty-grain-stores\" title=\"\">overcome the effects of annual food shortages</a> that affect more than 10% of the population.</p> <p>From October, President Joyce Banda's government says it will give away 60,000 goats to needy families on condition that they pass on the goats' kids to designated neighbours. The landlocked south-east African country is also drafting a nutrition act that will ban the sale of non-fortified basic foodstuffs.</p> <p>Senior civil servants claim the moves mark a departure from farming policies that simply aimed to fill people up with staple maize in lean times. Food shortages affect 1.6 million people every year, and an estimated 47% of children have stunted growth because of undernutrition, making them more vulnerable to illness and learning difficulties.</p> <p>Mary Shawa, the principal secretary for gender, said the nutrition act will send a signal that Banda, in power since April, considers food security a high priority. \"Childhood stunting has a direct impact on the economy. It is clear that nutrition needs to be tackled across several sectors, including agriculture, education, local government and academia, and that is what we are doing,'' she said.</p> <p>Jeffrey Luhanga, principal secretary for agriculture and food security, said stabilising food supply was his priority. Subsidies will increasingly focus on encouraging farmers to grow protein-rich crops and crops that can be exported or processed in the country, he said. \"In maize, you have starch but you also need lots of protein.\"</p> <p>Malawi, whose economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, has become something of a laboratory for food policy since 2004, when former president Bingu wa Mutharika defied resistance from donors and introduced a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2009/jul/10/malawi-farming-subsidies-programme\" title=\"\">generous seed and fertiliser subsidy programme</a>. After years of relying on food aid, in 2005 Malawi produced a grain surplus of more than 500,000 tonnes. The country repeated the feat in 2007 and increased its surplus in 2008.</p> <p>At the UN general assembly in 2008, Mutharika proclaimed that his \"green revolution\" was a recipe for \"Africa to feed the world\". To prove his point, he sent 150 tonnes of rice to Haiti after the earthquake there in January 2010.</p> <p>But Mutharika died halfway through a second term during which the country was almost bankrupted by nepotism, corruption and his highly personalised \"green revolution\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/29/malawi-president-joyce-banda-women-rights\" title=\"\">He was replaced by his deputy, Banda</a>.</p> <p>\"The subsidy programme was producing too much maize,'' said Luhanga. \"The new government has introduced a 1.6bn kwacha ($5.5m) subsidy programme for 1.5m farmers to grow maize but also groundnuts, soya, legumes and wheat. We are looking at nutrition but also income diversity and ways of improving soil fertility through crop choices.''</p> <p>The initiative to give away goats \u2013 similar to Rwanda's cows-for-peace reconciliation programme \u2013 will cost the government 900m kwachas ($3m) this year. \"The beauty of it [the plan] is that a goat can produce four kids in a year, allowing for a rapid expansion of the livestock pass-on programme,'' said Luhanga.</p> <p>In the long term, Malawi needs to become an exporter of processed foodstuffs, he said. \"We need to be able to offer value-added products like butter from our own milk and yarn from our cotton. We are landlocked and it is unrealistic to expect an income from putting raw materials on the road.''</p> <p>However, Malawi has a long way to go and a potentially restive population to deal with. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/20/malawi-riots-troops-teargas-protesters\" title=\"\">Last year, protesters rioted against the cost of living</a> and the suspension of European aid that had provided 40% of the country's revenues.</p> <p>Shortly after coming to power, Banda devalued the kwacha, a measure welcomed by the donors <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/25/malawians-counting-cost-economic-reform\" title=\"\">but which created 25% inflation</a>. Since 2009, the country has been gripped by a fuel shortage, medicine is in short supply and strikes are constant in many sectors, with around 169,000 civil servants waiting to be paid.</p> <p>Last week, the arrival of the new British high commissioner, Michael Nevin, revived diplomatic relations between Malawi and its biggest foreign donor more than a year after Nevin's predecessor, Fergus Cochrane-Dyet, was ordered to leave the country for criticising Muharika.</p> <p>But Nevin warned that British bilateral aid would not be forthcoming until Malawi appoints someone to head its anti-corruption bureau. The new candidate must be approved by the public appointments office, which is stuffed with people from Mutharika's government who fear being targeted in sleaze investigations.</p>",
  "<p>Pubs in Britain are closing at a rate of 50 a week, and in France 6,000 cafes close every year, mostly driven by a change in demand and a lack of customers. Are our lifestyles changing so fast that we take less time to stop and think and have conversations with friends or even strangers in a social environment where we see others doing the same?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.futurefoundation.net/page/view/details\" title=\"\">The Future Foundation</a> tells us that in the UK increasing numbers of young people are not leaving the house to go out to play or meet friends, and this is affecting their learning, health and ability to function at school, work and in wider society.</p> <p>There is abundant research that highlights a strong and positive correlation between the ability to collaborate and to innovate. In the UK for example, employees given the opportunity to collaborate at work are twice as likely to have contributed new ideas in their teams and to the organisation as a whole. We also know that smart leaders and organisations recognise that there is a compelling reason to consider how best to manage partnership working and stakeholder engagement, and to make this a central and critical element of their business and enterprise strategies.</p> <p>Although the rapid growth of global media and communications provides us with more tools that appear to make us more accessible, at the end of the day isn't it how we behave and react with our colleagues, our partners and our collaborators that will make the difference to the effectiveness and performance of the enterprise we are part of? To really know what we think and feel about a person, a project, a deal or a partner we usually need to be alongside of them watching their behaviour and reading the subliminal messages, just as they are watching ours.</p> <p>So, are we caught in a paradox? It may be shaped on the one hand by a complex globalised communication network giving us widening access to a hundred and one ways to talk and communicate with people almost anywhere any time. On the other, does it reduce our opportunities for direct spontaneous and planned collective interactions and conversations in which we can see, feel and measure the reactions to our ideas and thoughts? Whatever starting point, we cannot turn our back on the fact that society owes its success (and future survival) through finding solutions through collaboration. This is as true for organisations as it is for individuals, families and communities, whether meeting in pubs and cafes or Skype conferencing.</p> <p>Leading and thriving in the current volatile enterprise environment, working with reduced resources, requires us to focus more sharply on our relational behaviours, and to move from expert managers to entrepreneurial enablers, leading in groups and organisations by creating new and dynamic partnerships that will drive and develop innovation and new enterprise.</p> <p>The challenge for leaders in social enterprises, local government or corporate business, is how best to capture the benefits that flow from engaging new partners, and then to recognise that, by forming alliances this empowers us all to lead more effectively and efficiently. The critical DNA for successful partnership always has to be a common purpose and better outcomes. So where do we start to build what <a href=\"http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Teams_at_the_top_42\" title=\"\">McKinsey &amp; Co (2010)</a> describe as \"collective leadership\"; how do we make the capacity of teams, not individuals, become the drivers of performance wherever we need it?</p> <p>The starting point is ourselves, and how we manage our reactions in the context of our own personal, professional and organisational settings \u2013 where do we draw our emotional intelligence from, and how do we apply it, and how do others see us? Critically then, how can we better navigate our way through a whole spectrum of variables thrown up when we begin to work with others in partnerships? There is little room in this scenario for the \"hero leader\".</p> <p>So, yes we need to sharpen our emotional intelligence, and understand better how to present as adaptive, reflective and inclusive leaders if we want to have half a chance of success in partnerships. But we particularly need to consider our strengths in four important areas if we want to become more adept collaborators and be able to sustain our leadership and grow our enterprises. What might a model to do this look like?</p> <p>Firstly, we need to build our capacity to think differently and holistically \u2013 what John Gardener calls the \"five minds for the future\" \u2013 in which he urges us to synthesise disciplined thinking with creative, respectful and ethical thinking. Then combine this with the second key component, our relational qualities \u2013 of which there might be seven, from leading as a change agent to taking risks as an innovator, through to entrepreneurship and persistent collaboration. Thirdly, we need to build and sustain our capacity to work in a way that Charles Desforges describes as a \"three-times multiplier\" of our motivation, our knowledge and the opportunities we create. If any one of these three components is at zero we simply won't have the capacity to act. And lastly, how we lever success through managing risk, enabling others to collaborate and engage stakeholders in common purpose, always settling for high quality outcomes. If these are the right components of a robust partnership development model, the challenge is how to develop them and then collaborate consistently.</p> <p>So, in this interconnected global world, both respecting and understanding difference (in terms of needs, outcomes, demographics and cultures) is as important as using the technology to increase our knowledge and communicate in new ways.</p> <p>But, as we access and assess more and more data, are we dulling our innate relational antennae and missing a few tricks when it comes to relationship building through conversation and spontaneous innovation of ideas and knowledge? My experience of the challenges facing partnerships in the public sector suggests that we need to find time to refresh our thinking, and consider how best to really make a difference through purposeful partnering and sustainable collaboration by applying the four protocols and letting go of some of the technology.</p> <p><em>David Kelly runs </em><a href=\"http://www.leadershipinnovation.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>bespoke leadership development programmes</em></a><em> and open workshops.
