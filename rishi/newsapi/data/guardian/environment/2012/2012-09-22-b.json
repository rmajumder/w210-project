  "<p><strong>Price</strong> \u00a37,630<br> <strong>MPG</strong> 62.8<br> <strong>Top speed</strong> 99mph<br><br>Keeping a tab on who's getting into bed with who in the motoring industry requires all the relationship savvy of a divorce-hardened couples counsellor. Unlikely alliances seem to spring up faster than they do&#xa0;during the last dance at a youth club. And the results of these automotive liaisons mean that the car you are driving may not be exactly what you think it is. Would you have guessed that your Volvo S40 has the same DNA as a&#xa0;Ford Focus and a Mazda 3? Or that a&#xa0;Ford Galaxy is a VW Sharan, which is a Seat Alhambra by any other name?</p> <p>This week's example of a motoring cross-fertilisation is the Skoda Citigo: a city-friendly supermini designed to cope with the horrors of urban motoring. It just so happens that the Citigo is the same as the VW Up! and the Seat Mii. By the same, I don't mean that all three share a passion for congested streets, red lights and speed bumps \u2013 I mean that they are essentially identical triplets. They all come off the same production line in the same factory in Bratislava in Slovakia. All three manufacturers are, of course, owned by Volkswagen, and other than the badge and the odd very superficial difference, you'd be hard-pressed to spot the difference. Interestingly they don't all cost the same, though. The Up! is the most expensive and the Citigo the cheapest, but only by a few hundred quid. When you are spending less than eight grand on a car, the differences in price are never going to be that great. But why would VW make three different cars the same? It's all part of the huge German firm's masterplan for global domination and goes back to that basic tenet of marketeering: give the customer the impression of choice.</p> <p>The strange thing is that the impression of choice is very real. I&#xa0;have test-driven the Up! and now I&#xa0;am driving the Citigo. My head tells me that the cars are the same, but my heart insists there's a difference. The Up! felt innovative and new, while the Citigo feels economical and sensible. But then that is Skoda's home turf: the brand is a byword for cheap, reliable, no-nonsense motoring. And that is exactly what the Citigo feels like. It'll be hard for Seat's Mii to carve out a&#xa0;role in this triumvirate. The quirky black sheep of the family, maybe.</p> <p>The Citigo (and its brothers) makes a decent fist of taking the pain out of city driving. It's remarkably roomy for a car with such a small footprint and can easily seat four adults. The boot is narrow but surprisingly deep, so there's plenty of room for the shopping. Driving in town is not so much about driving as pausing \u2013 it's a waiting game \u2013 so, as you would hope, the Citigo comes with a decent stereo, a nifty detachable (theft-proof) infotainment device, loads of small clever storage cubbies, comfortable seats with plenty of headroom, and effective air con. It's a great car to be stuck in traffic in.</p> <p>It can handle the open road, too, its high-revving 1-litre engine coping with the demands of the motorway better than you would imagine. True, a long haul up to the Highlands or down to the West Country would be pretty knackering \u2013 but any pain you felt in your back would be compensated by the gentle ride the car gives your wallet: it'll do up to 78.5mpg on a steady run.</p> <p>So, easy to drive and easy on the wallet \u2013 the Citigo/Up!/Mii hardly seems like an intimidating weapon as VW goes head to head with GM and Toyota in the battle for global sales, but in a fight that's all about numbers, it's three in one.</p> <p><br>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/martinlove\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/profile/martinlove</a> for all his reviews in one place</p>",
  "<p>Only a few weeks after the close of the Olympics, I feel cheated. I thought the world was supposed to have changed. Women with muscles were supposed to be the new role models, we were told. Without even trying, Locog had left us with a new Olympic legacy \u2013 goodbye Kim Kardashian, hello Jessica Ennis.</p> <p>There are two things that seeing female athletes can do for women. One is to bring western ideals of the female body closer in line with the rest of the world. In West Africa, where I live, female celebrities look healthy. Size zero women \u2013 so far still a foreign concept here \u2013 often don't. You can't compete in the Olympics if&#xa0;you have been living on lettuce and steamed fish alone. I began to wonder&#xa0;whether the healthy-looking woman could become a new global standard for beauty.</p> <p>But the other thing about female athletes is that they are strong. They have muscles. Therefore, in my logic, this new Olympic legacy was going to&#xa0;make the muscular woman socially acceptable, even \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 desirable. And my crude logic goes further. If society looks up to physically strong women, I thought, that sends subliminal messages about the desirability of being a woman who is strong in other ways, too.</p> <p>It has taken mere weeks for these illusions of mine to come crashing down. And my wake-up came in the form of a&#xa0;TV interview with Serena Williams last week. The tennis superstar was on an all-women panel on CNN. After being asked by host Donny Deutsch whether she enjoys spanking her male partners, Serena was told how intimidating she is. The&#xa0;obvious reason was because she is physically strong.</p> <p>I don't want to take Deutsch too seriously; he is after all the man who suggested the only reason the world was interested in Sarah Palin was because she is \"so hot\" \u2013 a statement so wrong on so many levels. But there is serious form when it comes to the media and the Williams sisters. Ever since they first started winning everything, it was as if they were wild beasts who had escaped the jungle and landed right inside lawn tennis.</p> <p>This recent article by Piers Morgan perfectly summarises this tone. Describing an early glimpse of Serena, he wrote: \"I once watched her destroy a young, tiny European waif so brutally on Centre Court at Wimbledon that I wanted to run out and protect her poor victim with a shield.\"</p> <p>Ironically, this was Piers Morgan's way of beginning an article about how wonderful he thinks Serena is, as if he discovered her humanity in spite of her brutish appearance. This is, I think, mainly because she is so physically strong. The fact that she is black doesn't help either: there is a long history of black women being regarded as intimidating and \u2013 as long as femininity was associated with being helpless and frail \u2013 less feminine. And now it seems that, Olympics or no Olympics, for a&#xa0;woman to be big, black and have biceps is still more than some people can cope with.</p> <p>And you don't have to be anything close to a grand slam champion to have experienced this. Confident women of all races are always getting told how intimidating we are.</p> <p>To the extent that I have experienced this, I have responded with defiance. I&#xa0;like to go to the gym and lift weights. Like a growing number of women, I discovered the advantages of pumping iron for my skeleton, posture and overall physical effectiveness. I&#xa0;learned to do cleans and presses, and was outraged to discover that many boys learn these lifts in school while women are messing around playing netball. I&#xa0;mean, netball is fine, but how many women have found it to be a&#xa0;useful life skill? And can it really help you carry a&#xa0;heavy baby around?</p> <p>I had hoped that, post-Olympics, women who look strong might not have to deal with stupidity any more. But it looks like I was wrong.</p> <p>Email Afua at <a href=\"mailto:afua.hirsch@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">afua.hirsch@theguardian.com</a> or visit <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch\" title=\"\">theguardian.com/profile/afuahirsch</a> for all her articles in one place.

  "<p>The promise of a better tomorrow is every politician's most potent pledge. Over the next three weeks, as the political conference season unfolds, the business of sharpening that offer for the 2015 general election \u2013 along with limiting in-fighting and enthusing the troops \u2013 will dominate. What is much less likely to be discussed is the evidence compiled for an important new report by the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a> that, without radical action, between now and 2020 we will become a nation of two halves. The rich will become richer while those on middle to lower incomes and the poor will see their already frugal standards of living markedly decline. This polarisation, and the hollowing out of the already struggling middle Britain, is damaging for individual citizens, the body politic and social cohesion and for the future health, wealth and well-being of UK plc. It must not be allowed to occur.</p> <p>The findings are the work of the independent and highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and the Institute for Economic Research (IER). In the report, \"Who Gains From Growth?\", they estimate that even if the economy returns to a \"golden scenario\" of steady growth, with no further cuts than those already announced, a household on a middle income of \u00a322,900 will forfeit \u00a3800 by 2020, a 3% drop. A low-income couple struggling on \u00a310, 600 (at 2009 prices) can expect a crippling drop of 15% to \u00a39,000. At the same time, those on \u00a350,000 plus a year will enjoy the cream of 1.5 million new jobs and see a rise of 0.2% in their annual income.</p> <p>The trends described in the report follow a pattern that has emerged in the US over the past 30 years. They signal the end of social mobility and the vanishing security of the middle classes. As many economists on both sides of the Atlantic have observed, this is largely because the richest have rewritten the rules.</p> <p>Financial deregulation; tax cuts for the most affluent; the gutting of the trade unions; a poisonous narrative about the deserving and undeserving poor and a fake housing boom leading to staggering levels of personal debt \u2013 these have ensured that the top 20% now possess 84% of US wealth while the middle are well and truly squeezed and the poor are losing their toehold on the ladder.</p> <p>In the UK, the interrelated challenges we face include an ageing population; technological advances that wipe out whole occupations; global competition and the large-scale underemployment of individuals, mostly women, overqualified for the menial jobs they have struggled to acquire. More than half of children living in poverty are in households in which at least one adult works. Add to that personal debt, the current duress of a double dip recession and the flagrant greed of a bonus-addicted banking sector, the beneficiaries of a recent generous tax cut, and the Resolution Foundation's findings that the potential gains from growth over the next eight years will go to the already well-heeled appear even more deeply injudicious and unfair.</p> <p>On several occasions in the postwar period, Britain has arrived at a point at which a new social contract is required and a redefinition of the rights and responsibilities of the state and the citizen demanded. Those historic moments came in 1945, in 1979, in 1997 and, arguably, the time has come again.</p> <p>The discussions, debates and decisions now under way across the political spectrum go to the heart of exactly what kind of society we wish to be.</p> <p>Is it possible to have \"fair shares for all\", as promised in the 1945 Labour party manifesto, when the public coffers were as empty as they are today? How do we reshape the economy and remodel the welfare state? What is the proper role of markets in a democratic society? What kind of support utilises rather than undermines the assets of individuals and communities so that society as a whole can thrive?</p> <p>Gavin Kelly, director of the Resolution Foundation, which commissioned \"Who Gains From Growth?\" for its non-partisan commission on living standards, rightly argues that these times call not for patchy incremental reforms but for approaches that are big, bold, radical and socially just. He says that the commission proposes a set of polices that, together, could ensure a more equitable sharing of the rewards of growth. It suggests a reform of the education system so that it invests far more in vocational education, skills and capabilities to meet the needs of a constantly changing labour market offering work for those at the lower end of the salary scale. It advocates heavily subsided childcare. Childcare is a societal problem, however; more than a million females have now been unemployed for two years and longer. Childcare is ruinously expensive. If work returns then, without help, many will have to remain on benefits \u2013 to everybody's cost.</p> <p>A living wage is also crucial. The campaign for a living wage \u2013 set at \u00a38.30 per hour in London \u2013 has been championed by the mayor, Boris Johnson. It is also part of Ed Miliband's strategy for reducing the cost to the public purse of tax credits that currently subsidise low wages. According to the IFS calculations, in some sectors, such as the financial sector, its adoption would have a minimal impact on profits but make a significant difference to middle and low incomes. The adoption of a living wage should appeal to socially aware major companies cognisant that every little helps. The combination of vocational education, childcare and a living wage, according to the IFS and IER, could remodel the current \"hourglass\" economy of \"lovely\" and \"lousy\" occupations and provide a middle income family with an extra \u00a31,600 a year.</p> <p>Other policies concerning housing, health, taxation and employees' representatives on remuneration boards to name but a few, are also part of any national debate on what should constitute a new social contract. What matters, too, is the story politicians tell us about who is to blame for austerity and skewed redistribution. A survey published last week suggests more of us believe we should spend less on benefits. Yet the highest levels of \"welfare dependency\" are also in areas in which there is long-term unemployment and several applicants for every vacancy.</p> <p>The chilling polarisation of society predicted by the IFS when accompanied by a political rhetoric that turns neighbour against neighbour and drains empathy also provides the most toxic of all responses to the vital question of how we wish to live together.</p>",
  "<p>What sort of man \u2013 for man it will be \u2013 does the church need at the see of Canterbury to succeed Rowan Williams?</p> <p>He should be learned but with a populist touch; a man of prayer as well as a man of action; a sensitive pastor with a hide of leather; a good manager but also a visionary leader with a servant heart; decisive yet subtle; a poet, a prelate, a star performer. In other words, he needs to be \"a realised impossibility\" as George Bernard Shaw said of William Temple when he was appointed to the job in 1942.</p> <p>One thing we know is this. He will be a currently serving bishop. This makes it easy for editors to assemble the longlist of candidates and for punters to get the odds. To be honest, they look a dreary lot. But maybe that's also a prerequisite for high office nowadays.</p> <p>Two names will be selected to go forward to the prime minister and one of them, in due course, will be the 105th archbishop. Whoever gets it, I hope he wants it. He will have my support. But actually, will it make much difference to my life as a parish priest in Hackney?</p> <p>The thing about the Church of England is that it has a big bottom. It really exists in parishes and gatherings of the faithful in communities up and down the country. Our deliberative assemblies are slow-moving, consensual and largely operate on the principle of subsidiarity. You can see the wheels of decision-making turning. This can make us ridiculous to the outsider, but also resistant to the blandishments of head office.</p> <p>Clergy are very wary of a bishop with a strategic plan, let alone an archbishop on a goddamn mission. One reason that the London diocese has flourished in recent years, so research tells us, is its culture of benign support for a range of diverse initiatives on the ground. Another reason is the growth in the number of black Christians in our pews. My parish, like most in this part of London, has members drawn from most of the Caribbean islands as well as West African countries. They were raised as Anglicans and are loyal servants of the church.</p> <p>Through travelling parishioners, I have exchanged stoles (a vestment) with a Ghanaian bishop as well as a Jamaican archdeacon. Although I rarely leave my small patch of east London I feel part of a global communion.</p> <p>How does an archbishop hold these two together, the local and the global? With difficulty. Over the last 10 years, these relationships have been strained through theological differences over homosexuality and it is a disagreement that is not going to disappear quickly. It seems to represent too much.</p> <p>But my hope is this: that the Church of England recognises how beneath this network of global relationships lies a pattern of colonial expansion and economic exploitation, a pattern that is replicated still today. A number of my parishioners find it hard to make mass on Sunday because they are too busy cleaning the offices of the financiers of the City of London.</p> <p>Can we talk about capitalism? Will we allow our new archbishop to speak of its barbaric heart? Will he have a disruptive candour as well as an easy charm? Maybe a couple of the candidates might. I hope they make it to the shortlist.</p>",
  "<p>The UK may have \"entered into a double-dip recession\", gushes the latest issue of <em>Legal Business</em>, a glossy magazine for corporate lawyers, \"but the UK's top law firms continue to post record growth and trend-busting profits.\"</p> <p>So they do. The upper end of the law is top-heavy with money. Jonathan Sumption QC earned the largest barrister's fee ever when he pocketed a reported \u00a35m for representing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/31/roman-abramovich-court-boris-berezovsky\" title=\"\">Roman Abramovich in his fight with Boris Berezovsky</a>. Profits at the richest 100 London law firms hit more than \u00a35bn for the first time last year. The richest seven paid their partners more than \u00a31m each.</p> <p>In Tuscan second homes the chianti is flowing because oligarchs and global corporations cannot get enough of the English legal system.</p> <p>Speaking last year to Clifford Chance, whose partners brought in \u00a31.3bn in 2011, the then justice secretary, Kenneth Clarke, accepted that the legal business had \"felt itself to be something of an overlooked Cinderella in its treatment by government\" \u2013 an odd description to use when partners in City law firms resemble no one so much as the Ugly Sisters, but I'll let it pass. The coalition now recognised the money to be made from litigation and wanted to push English legal services into the emerging markets. \"The UK may no longer be able to boast that it is the workshop of the world,\" Clarke declared. \"But the UK can be lawyer to the world.\" In the 1990s and 2000s, government thought that financial services offered a future for post-industrial Britain. Now, it sees legal services as our saviour.</p> <p>Ministers' ambition is embodied in the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/rcj-rolls-building/rolls-building\" title=\"\">Rolls Building</a>, which curves like a luxury liner near Fetter Lane in the City. The new home for commercial courts has none of the fustiness of the old, neogothic high court on the Strand. Opened last year at a cost of \u00a3300m, it looks like the headquarters for a fashionable tech firm: all glass and steel, and with a central atrium from where a spiral staircase twists up towards the sky.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice hopes it will help Britain become the \"largest specialist centre for the resolution of financial, business and property litigation anywhere in the world\" and on the face of it, there seems little to object to in that. I have many criticisms of the judiciary, but I have never entertained the notion that an English judge would take a bribe or succumb to pressure from the state. You cannot say the same of judges in Moscow, New Delhi or Beijing. The incorruptibility of the judiciary and the work ethic of the lawyers ensure that more international commercial disputes take place in London than in any other city in the world. And of course we need whatever taxes the lawyers' accountants condescend to pass to the Revenue.</p> <p>\"Wimbledonisation\" is an ugly term business writers reach for on these occasions. Andy Murray apart, we may not have great tennis players, they say, but in commerce, as in sport, we can still host the best foreign players.</p> <p>Yet there are already signs that this trend in English law will be as great a disappointment as it was in English finance. Even Abramovich's solicitors accepted that the sceptical may wonder what a dispute about the division of the loot from the old Soviet empire had to do with us.</p> <p>The British taxpayer saw no direct benefit. Mrs Justice Gloster began hearing the Abramovich case on 3 October 2011. The proceedings lasted until 21 December 2011. She considered her verdict until 31 August 2012, and still has months more to spend writing her judgment.</p> <p>For this service, the public purse received next to nothing. High Court and Court of Appeal users pay \u00a31,090 for a trial hearing regardless of its length. The Ministry of Justice suggested last year that it might raise the price of High Court and Court of Appeal cases lasting more than 10 days to \u00a310,900, but that would still not cover the costs of a fresh battle between the oligarchs and in any case nothing has been done.</p> <p>Like the National Theatre and the House of Windsor, the law is subsidised by the taxpayer because it brings in the tourists, but in this instance they are the wealthiest tourists on the planet who can afford to pay their way.</p> <p>Beyond the freeloading lies an existential question: who is the law for? Sitting in London, it is not too fanciful to imagine the legal system of England and Wales detaching itself from the peoples of England and Wales.</p> <p>Its best lawyers no longer want to work for them, because they cannot afford their fees. Its judges cannot hear their disputes for months because they are tied up hearing the disputes of plutocrats.</p> <p>As we already know, the government's cuts to legal aid mean that ministers are deliberately placing the poorest beyond the law. On matters of vital concern \u2013 housing, debt, benefit claim \u2013 they will have no access to justice.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ministers tell the middle classes to settle their disputes by arbitration, which is a reasonable way for reasonable people to reach an agreement, but if one of the parties is unreasonable the middle classes still need judges and lawyers to intervene. They are becoming harder to find. A senior judge told me that he knew British corporate lawyers who had never represented a human being. Soon we will have British corporate lawyers who have never represented a British company either.</p> <p>With the exception of a few judges, there is no resistance to the law's embrace of bling. After pocketing his Russian gold, Sumption was elevated from being a working barrister to a seat in the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land.</p> <p>Like Peter Bazalgette, who made a fortune from broadcasting trash and has been rewarded with the chairmanship of the Arts Council, Sumption found that the modern British state celebrates the accumulation of money by whatever means necessary. The richer you are the more deserving of honours you become.</p> <p>The credit crunch was so severe in Britain because the Wimbledonisation of finance ended when the crash forced all the foreign banks the government had encouraged to come to these islands to head home and take their credit for families and businesses with them.</p> <p>In the legal world, it will end when the people realise that the law of the land is the law of everybody's land but theirs.</p>",
  "<p>Ancient humans used complex hunting techniques to ambush and kill antelopes, gazelles, wildebeest and other large animals at least two million years ago. The discovery \u2013 made by anthropologist Professor Henry Bunn of Wisconsin University \u2013 pushes back the definitive date for the beginning of systematic human hunting by hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>Two million years ago, our human ancestors were small-brained apemen and in the past many scientists have assumed the meat they ate had been gathered from animals that had died from natural causes or had been left behind by lions, leopards and other carnivores.</p> <p>But Bunn argues that our apemen ancestors, although primitive and fairly puny, were capable of ambushing herds of large animals after carefully selecting individuals for slaughter. The appearance of this skill so early in our evolutionary past has key implications for the development of human intellect.</p> <p>\"We know that humans ate meat two million years ago,\" said Bunn, who was speaking in Bordeaux at the annual meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.eshe.eu/\" title=\"\">European Society for the study of Human Evolution</a> (ESHE). \"What was not clear was the source of that meat. However, we have compared the type of prey killed by lions and leopards today with the type of prey selected by humans in those days. This has shown that men and women could not have been taking kill from other animals or eating those that had died of natural causes. They were selecting and killing what they wanted.\"</p> <p>That finding has major implications, he added. \"Until now the oldest, unambiguous evidence of human hunting has come from a 400,000-year-old site in Germany where horses were clearly being speared and their flesh eaten. We have now pushed that date back to around two million years ago.\"</p> <p>The hunting instinct of early humans is a controversial subject. In the first half of the 20th century, many scientists argued that our ancestors' urge to hunt and kill drove us to develop spears and axes and to evolve bigger and bigger brains in order to handle these increasingly complex weapons. Extreme violence is in our nature, it was argued by fossil experts such as Raymond Dart and writers like Robert Ardrey, whose book <em>African Genesis</em> on the subject was particularly influential. By the 80s, the idea had run out of favour, and scientists argued that our larger brains evolved mainly to help us co-operate with each other. We developed language and other skills that helped us maintain complex societies.</p> <p>\"I don't disagree with this scenario,\" said Bunn. \"But it has led us to downplay the hunting abilities of our early ancestors. People have dismissed them as mere scavengers and I don't think that looks right any more.\"</p> <p>In his study, Bunn and his colleagues looked at a huge butchery site in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. The carcasses of wildebeest, antelopes and gazelles were brought there by ancient humans, most probably members of the species <em>Homo habilis</em>, more than 1.8 million years ago. The meat was then stripped from the animals' bones and eaten.</p> <p>\"We decided to look at the ages of the animals that had been dragged there,\" said Benn. \"By studying the teeth in the skulls that were left, we could get a very precise indication of what type of meat these early humans were consuming. Were they bringing back creatures that were in their prime or were old or young? Then we compared our results with the kinds of animals killed by lions and leopards.\"</p> <p>The results for several species of large antelope Bunn analysed showed that humans preferred only adult animals in their prime, for example. Lions and leopards killed old, young and adults indiscriminately. For small antelope species, the picture was slightly different. Humans preferred only older animals, while lions and leopards had a fancy only for adults in their prime.</p> <p>\"For all the animals we looked at, we found a completely different pattern of meat preference between ancient humans and other carnivores, indicating that we were not just scavenging from lions and leopards and taking their leftovers. We were picking what we wanted and were killing it ourselves.\"</p> <p>Bunn believes these early humans probably sat in trees and waited until herds of antelopes or gazelles passed below, then speared them at point-blank range. This skill, developed far earlier than suspected, was to have profound implications. Once our species got a taste for meat, it was provided with a dense, protein-rich source of energy. We no longer needed to invest internal resources on huge digestive tracts that were previously required to process vegetation and fruit, which are more difficult to digest. Freed from that task by meat, the new, energy-rich resources were then diverted inside our bodies and used to fuel our growing brains.</p> <p>As a result, over the next two million years our crania grew, producing species of humans with increasingly large brains \u2013 until this carnivorous predilection produced <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p>",
  "<p>A fresh oil crisis is brewing. However, this time it won't be hitting the garage forecourts but the nation's kitchens.</p> <p>The wholesale price of extra virgin olive oil has jumped 62% in three months after a severe drought in Spain, the world's largest producer, wiped out an estimated 600,000 tonnes of production.</p> <p>Filippo Berio, the UK's biggest olive oil supplier, has warned that it will be forced to pass on the increase to consumers.</p> <p>\"The [wholesale] prices are going up rapidly daily,\" said Walter Zanre, managing director of Filippo Berio, which sells 10m litres of oil a year in Britain.</p> <p>\"It's very difficult to buy olive oil because they [the growers] are waiting for it to go up even higher next week. You're looking at \u00a32,800 per tonne [of extra virgin olive oil].\"</p> <p>Zanre said the extent to which the increase in costs is passed on to shoppers, is \"the million dollar question\". He said: \"I would say 25% now, but if we had had this conversation 10 days ago I would have said 10% to 15%.\"</p> <p>The average 500ml bottle of supermarket brand olive oil currently costs about \u00a32, while a 500ml bottle of Filippo Berio oil sells for \u00a33.39.</p> <p>\"We are torturing ourselves because our product will go over the psychologically important \u00a34 barrier,\" said Zanre. \"This isn't a 5% blip, we can't tighten our belts and absorb it.\"</p> <p>Consumers who can't bear the thought of going without olive oil are advised to stock up before the price rise hits. Zanre said supermarkets have a \"virtual embargo on retail price increases\" in the runup to Christmas, so now would be the time to get your supplies in for 2013.</p> <p>Thomas Mielke, director of <em>Oil World</em>, a trade journal that tracks oil prices, said the staggering price rise results from an \"unprecedented decline\" in stocks, particularly in Spain.</p> <p>Spanish olive trees have been hit by drought and an unexpected frost in the flowering season in spring. This has led to trees producing less fruit and the olives that have grown are less juicy than normal.</p> <p>\"The fruit can be shrivelled and not looking normal, much smaller in size, which means they produce less oil,\" Mielke said.</p> <p>The poor crop, due to be harvested in October, comes a year after Spain returned its best crop in years, causing an olive oil glut and a steep fall in prices that left many growers on the breadline.</p> <p>Spain is by far the most important country involved in olive cultivation and accounts for almost half of worldwide supplies. \"Whatever happens in Spain causes massive changes in the world price,\" said Vito Martielli, senior oil seeds analyst at Rabobank International. \"Last year, Spain had a very good season and produced 1.4m tonnes of olive oil, but this season it is expected to be less than 1m.

While it has reached saturation point in Spain and Italy, countries like the US and Australia are relative newcomers and are using much more olive oil.\"</p> <p>A rising number of the British are also turning to olive oil, according to Zanre. \"The appetite is growing continually,\" he said. \"There's a bit of a love affair with it among the chattering middle classes, but other people are consuming it too.\"</p> <p>He said the average Briton consumes half a litre of olive oil a year, far below the 14 litres a head in Italy, the world's biggest consumer.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/16/school-budget-cuts-breakfast-clubs\" title=\"\">Thank you for highlighting the issue about children arriving at school hungry and without breakfast</a> (News). Forty years ago, I started my career as a teacher in rural Wiltshire and can remember children in my class being lethargic at the start of the school day. I am sure this was due to coming to school without breakfast.</p> <p>I have taught and worked in many rural and inner-city schools and nurseries and remember many children arriving and being unable to concentrate because they had not had breakfast.</p> <p>I am looking at a book belonging to my grandpa, <em>Wastage of Child Life</em>, published in 1909 by the Fabian Socialist. It reads: \"\u2026 mind depends upon body, and both upon feeding, then the best way to build up mind is to build up body; and clearly too, it is worse than useless to attempt the education of children who are underfed.</p> <p>\"The refusal to feed the hungry child is an economy as false as it is cruel. It is cruel because it is useless to attempt to teach an underfed child and to leave him unfed is to stunt his physique\u2026\"</p> <p>More than a century later, little has changed.</p> <p><strong>Mari Booker</strong></p> <p>Brighton</p> <p><strong>Justifiable compensation</strong></p> <p>It is to be welcomed that your paper opposes Vince Cable's plans to cut unfair dismissal compensation (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/editorial-employment-vince-cable?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Making it easier to fire people is no way to solve unemployment</a>\", Editorial). However, it reads as if anyone \"chucked on the scrapheap through no fault of their own\" is at present entitled to adequate compensation. Most public sector workers being made redundant get very much less. Only a time-server on a relatively high income could expect anything like the maximum awarded for unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, to win a claim for unfair dismissal, an employee needs to prove they have been treated very badly. It takes considerable resource in terms of money and stamina, so only a tiny fraction of those made redundant will pursue this course.</p> <p>What the coalition appear to be suggesting is that being treated unfairly is more acceptable now because we are in a recession. Being treated unfairly should be seen as unacceptable at any time and the compensation should reflect this.</p> <p><strong>Jane Wess</strong></p> <p>via email</p> <p><strong>Henry VII\u2026 only a little Welsh</strong></p> <p>Perhaps too much is being made about the rehabilitation of Richard III (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/15/king-villains-richard-iii\" title=\"\">My kingdom for a makeover: could a skeleton prompt a rethink of Richard III?</a>\", In Focus). Obviously, our view is distorted by Tudor propaganda, but the death of Richard III, a king of England but not an English king, saw the end of the French kings of England who had ruled since 1066. The victory at Bosworth was not that of a \"Welshman\" leading a spectacular military rebellion \u2013 Henry Tudor, only partly Welsh, was the senior surviving legitimate Lancastrian claimant to the throne, following decades of civil war between the houses of York and Lancaster.</p> <p>He was the last king of England to gain by victory on the battlefield and, aware of his somewhat obscure claim to the throne of England, claimed it by right of conquest, making doubly sure by marrying Elizabeth of York.</p> <p><strong>John Owen</strong></p> <p>Caerphilly</p> <p><strong>Police reform: an old idea</strong></p> <p>Andrew Rawnsley (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/andrew-rawnsley-poice-reform?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">The police must no longer be free from radical reform</a>\", Comment) notes that one of the proposed Winsor reforms to the police is to allow direct appointment to the higher ranks from outside the police.

  "<p>James Flynn studied mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago, before switching to political philosophy. Currently, he is a professor of political studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand. His name has been lent to the \"Flynn effect\" \u2013 his discovery that IQ scores have risen significantly from one generation to another over the past century. He is 78.</p> <p><strong>What does IQ measure?</strong><br>That depends what it's used for. Sometimes, an IQ test is a force for good. You have a kid at school who is doing badly and you think he seems brighter than that. You give him an IQ test and he knocks the socks out of it. So it can be used to help diagnose an individual's educational problems. Some universities use IQ tests as part of an entrance exam.</p> <p>The second thing they are often used for is to measure the difference between groups. But this works only if their quality of environment is roughly comparable.</p> <p><strong>Your book, <em>Are We Getting Smarter?</em>, talks about the recent IQ gains made by women.</strong><br>Women today match men but only in advanced countries, where women get an equal shake. One of the most interesting things is that at university women do have IQs about two points lower than men, maybe three, and a lot of scholars say: \"Ah-ha, that means women aren't as bright\", but why do you think that might be?</p> <p><strong>Is it to do with the type of people who pursue going to university?</strong><br>Well, it has to do with the fact that, if you take a girl of 17 from secondary school with an IQ of 100, she will get better grades than the typical boy. So that means that the girl with the IQ of 100 may well get to university and the boy won't. So the male sample is more elite; it has a higher threshold. This reveals one of the disturbing things about British education: if you look at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics, at the end of secondary school, only the top third of boys matches the top half of girls for reading. In America, only the top quarter of boys matches the top half of girls for written composition. This is why so many women are beginning to dominate journalism and law.</p> <p><strong>If I took an early IQ test, would I find it baffling the way the problems are set?</strong><br>No, you would knock the socks out of it because people who designed the early IQ test were ahead of their time. They were highly professional people who had been schooled in the scientific ethos, and they weren't typical of their day. Let's take a question that you would get and an intelligent person of 1900 might not: if you were asked: \"What do dogs and rabbits have in common?\", what would you say?</p> <p><strong>They are both mammals.</strong><br>Correct. A kid in 1900 would say: \"You use dogs to hunt rabbits.\" He would get the question wrong because, before people had lots of formal schooling, they had a utilitarian mentality, and they were fixated on the concrete world and using it to advantage. You've been raised in a scientific world where you think classifying things is an obvious prerequisite for understanding them. To you, a dog and a rabbit are just mammals; you are not interested in whether it is a beagle and good for hunting rabbits. So IQ gains over time are totally fascinating if you know how to interpret them and don't just run around saying: \"Are we getting more intelligent?\"</p> <p><strong>So these observations show that IQ is determined by environment rather than genes?</strong><br>At the individual level, genes are important, as they are for other qualities such as height.</p> <p>It's very different, however, to use IQ to compare groups and say that, because one group has a lower mean IQ, that shows that it is genetically inferior. For example, if you look at developing nations, there are six for which we have good IQ data. Three of these are making gains faster now than we Europeans are. These are Turkey, Brazil and Kenya and I predict that eventually all three of them are going to match us for IQ. As for the three other nations, there is nothing the matter with their genes but with their circumstances. You have Sudan, where they keep having civil wars; you have Saudi Arabia, where most of them are sitting around feather-bedding on oil wells; and you have the Dominican Republic, where they have their infrastructure wiped out every 10 years by hurricanes, tsunamis and tornadoes. There is nothing the matter with their genes, but if Britain had all of its infrastructure destroyed every 10 years, it wouldn't be doing so well.</p> <p><strong>You have also described something you call the \"bright tax\".</strong><br>It has always been thought that bright people's minds deteriorated less after the age of 65. I found that that was true for verbal abilities, but the brighter you are the faster your analytical abilities deteriorate after 65, all the way down the scale. Even the average person deteriorates more quickly than the below-average. That sets an interesting question. Is the good analytic brain, like a high-performance sports car, something that requires more maintenance in old age than the body can give it \u2013 that would be a physiological hypothesis. Or is it that we mainly use our analytic ability at work, so that if you are bright you have a cognitively demanding job and when you retire you are like an athlete who has lost his exercise advantage.</p> <p><strong>How would one mitigate this cognitive decline post-65: do crosswords, take up running, learn a new language?</strong><br>Mental exercise will do you good at any age. Even if your brain is deteriorating, it will deteriorate more slowly if you use it. Just as while I can't run 10k anything like [as fast as] when I was young, if you are really out of shape, even at 78, I could give you a hard time.</p> <p><strong>Are you going to tell me your time for 10k?</strong><br>When I was young it was 32 minutes, and in those days the world record was around 29. When I was 66, I could still run it in 45\u00bd. My ability to run at under 50 minutes has receded since I have entered my 70s.</p> <p><strong>Other than the obvious physical benefits, why do you run?</strong><br>There is no doubt that the blood supply to the brain, due to a cardiovascular system that is efficient, helps intelligence in the pre-frontal lobes; that is true. I don't do it for that reason, but I am sure that I get the benefit.</p> <p>There was a wonderful study by the OECD where they gave a test of working memory \u2013 what a pity it wasn't a test of analytical ability, but it wasn't \u2013 and they divided the countries into those like France, where 80% of people retired between 55-65, and those like Sweden and Switzerland, where 80% were still in work, and the loss on working memory in France for that age was twice as great. Which tells us that, if you kept exercising your brain at work, your working memory held up better.</p> <p><strong>You have written four books this year, including one about climate change.</strong><br>I kept the book under 100 pages, it is called <em>Climate Change and the Environment</em> \u2013 I'm looking for a publisher. I guarantee anyone can read it in less than four hours and learn what they need to know.</p> <p>My conclusion is that, yes, we are making a contribution. At one time, the climate sceptics had a case, but their case is now falling apart. Keep your eye on the west Antarctic ice shelf: we are in trouble. It looks as if it's going to go, and, even if half of it goes over the next century, that will raise sea levels by three metres, and your beloved London is going to be in a fix.</p> <p>Laser fusion is probably the best long-range hope for clean energy: that is where you bombard heavy hydrogen with fusion to try to set up an interaction that would actually generate more energy than you put into it. But that research is probably about 70 years away from being dominant. Before then we are going to need a stopgap.</p> <p>Are We Getting Smarter?<em> by James R Flynn is published by Cambridge University Press (\u00a316.99)</em></p>",
  "<p>Like George Smiley, I had long been suspicious of golf. Asked who was responsible for the promotion in his beloved Circus of one particularly oleaginous reptile, Le Carr\u00e9's weary spy had snapped: \"Golfers. Golfers and Conservatives.\" Golf was for my dad, not for me. My friend Dave, who years ago had sported a greatcoat and sold leftist newspapers to other unwary students, reviled it as the game of the petit bourgeois. Yet here we were, Dave and I, some 20 miles north of Aberdeen, rain sweeping in and the sound of breakers 100ft below to our left, a gushing burn and thick grass coursing on the right. Too far ahead, a stiff flag. At my feet, a&#xa0;white ball. Had it come to this? Had&#xa0;I turned into\u2026 a Conservative?</p> <p>I had begun to harbour secret longings for golf not long after Dad, an enthusiastic player, died in 2004, but had never acted on my impulses. My 25-year friendship with Dave then reversed into one of its periodic troughs of silence. Meeting at a&#xa0;funeral, we agreed tentatively to try our hand at golf. It seemed the ideal middle-aged bloke reunion sport: we&#xa0;could spend time together failing to discuss what had driven us apart, concentrating only on the hacks, shanks, slices, lost balls and missed putts. There was a lot of swearing and, eventually, a lot of laughter. And annoyingly, through a combination of fanaticism and brute strength, Dave became the better player. The road to&#xa0;redemption, I reckoned, led to taking him to Scotland where, playing with my father's clubs and with the native blood of the links player surging through me, I was bound to win our own version of the Ryder Cup \u2013 an England v Scotland showdown covering three courses in three days.</p> <p>We landed at Dyce airport outside Aberdeen, with a fine view of Donald Trump's personal jet (it has TRUMP in massive capitals along the fuselage, just so he won't lose it). The Donald was in Scotland to promote his new course and the luxury hotel that he's threatening not to build if Alex Salmond's government puts a wind farm in the sea beside it. </p> <p>Our base was Meldrum House in the village of Oldmeldrum. With its baronial towers, heavy wood interior and roaring fire, it recalled the Scottish country posh hotels I was dragged to as a child. The happy difference between then and now was that this time the food was glorious (locally sourced, seasonal) and the staff actually wanted guests to enjoy their stay. A quick dash from there took us to Cruden Bay, which is where my pangs of Toryness had begun.</p> <p>We bad golfers love to take in the scenery, because it takes our minds off the score. Cruden Bay has rugged views out over rocks and beach to the&#xa0;North Sea and the ruins of <a href=\"http://www.visitscotland.com/info/see-do/slains-castle-p255271\" title=\"\">Slains Castle</a>, admired by Dr Johnson and&#xa0;Bram Stoker. But stood in a storm with soaking hands, I was beyond seeing the attractions of the castle or of golf. Then I whacked a club without thinking\u2026 and it was the best&#xa0;shot I'd hit for months. It was enough to make me forget the 100 other shots of misery and defeat. That night, after an Arbroath smokie risotto and a warming dram of the local Glen Garioch in front of the log fire, and even while chatting about author Jo Nesb\u00f8 to the Norwegian guest who turned out to be a&#xa0;\"towmaster\", whose job it was to move oil rigs around, one thought dominated: I&#xa0;had to win tomorrow. Well, and one&#xa0;other. Is there a more manly job&#xa0;in the world than being the chap who&#xa0;moves oil rigs around?</p> <p>Day two, and the clouds had not lifted. Oldmeldrum's own course was a casualty of relentless rain. Over a&#xa0;more than hearty breakfast we asked if the hotel could find out if&#xa0;nearby Fraserburgh was open. \"Yes,&#xa0;but bring your own snorkel,\" was the response. How could we resist?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396494947\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348063292489/Meldrum-House-in-Oldmeldr-001.jpg\" alt=\"Meldrum House in Oldmeldrum \" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meldrum House in Oldmeldrum </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But first to <a href=\"http://www.glengarioch.com/verify.php\" title=\"\">Glen Garioch distillery</a> (it's pronounced Geery). An entertaining tour provided a lesson in the two sides of automation \u2013 the&#xa0;back-breaking work of hauling sacks of barley and casks of whisky is long gone, but then so are many of the jobs that it brought \u2013 and, surprisingly, in globalisation: the huge copper still bears signs of careful repair work, but buying a new one is out of the question because of&#xa0;the soaring prices for raw materials brought about by Chinese expansion. Fortified by a few nips (sometimes I'm glad I don't drive), I&#xa0;was chauffeured to Fraserburgh.</p> <p>Planted between the sea and the B9033 coast road (although I suspect that wasn't there in 1777, when golf was first played here), the course looks across to the town's harbour and lighthouse. And as the full complement of seasons passed over us, I came to like it \u2013 particularly when a lucky bounce gave me the&#xa0;chance to snatch the lead in the match. One all.</p> <p>For our final showdown, we arrived early at <a href=\"http://www.murcarlinks.com/\" title=\"\">Murcar</a>, with the spires of Aberdeen rising to the south. This course used to have its own railway, but now it's a drive down a farm track to the clubhouse, which, like all others hereabouts, has&#xa0;photographs of local boy and Ryder Cup player Paul Lawrie. Here, huge sand dunes filter out even the sound of the sea, busy with oil traffic. We came to the last exhilarated \u2013 and all square. Dave was in a bunker so steep I couldn't see him. I felt this was in the bag. So he miraculously got the ball out and then made the testing 8ft-putt that halved the hole, the match and the entire contest. Couldn't have scripted it better.</p> <p>In the welcoming clubhouse, the members are discussing the new Trump course. As at Cruden Bay, they're all for it. The more visiting golfers to the area, the better for all \u2013 and these two courses are half the price of Trump International's \u00a3150 a round. They're also unpretentious and resolutely unsnooty, because golf has long been a game for everyone in Scotland. </p> <p>On my way home, I called in on Dad's old course, <a href=\"http://www.obangolf.com/\" title=\"\">Glencruitten</a>, in Oban, and dragged his clubs up and down its quirky, well-tended holes. It saddened me that I never played with him, but sometimes I&#xa0;could almost sense him alongside. Better late than never. Bloody silly, annoying game.

  "<p>Eugenia Tymoshenko steps out of a cab in sunny Knightsbridge wearing black high heels, a smart tan skirt and black jacket. She could be something senior at Goldman Sachs, but her pressing business is about life, death and justice. The 32-year-old is on a campaign to free her mother from a seven-year jail sentence in a Ukrainian prison \u2013 and, she says, from physical and mental torture that threatens to kill her.</p> <p>Eugenia's mother is Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine, sent to prison after a sequence of events that combines the plot of a revenge thriller with the darkest politics of the Soviet Union era. In October last year, Tymoshenko was found guilty of criminally \"abusing her office\" in what the United States and European Union have both called a politically motivated show trial. Even Russian president Vladimir Putin criticised the sentence. Since the start of her prison term, her daughter claims, Yulia has been beaten and denied access to a doctor or drugs. She has also been accused \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of the murder of a fellow MP. Tymoshenko's supporters have protested and battled police on the streets of Kiev, and Tymoshenko herself has gone on hunger strike. Now it seems her only hope of freedom is her daughter.</p> <p>Eugenia makes an unlikely saviour. Until her mother's sentence, her career was running an Italian restaurant in Kiev. \"I never had any ambition for politics,\" she tells me. These days Eugenia strides confidently into TV studios for interviews. She talks with poise and passion to presidents and prime ministers. She addresses meetings of MEPs and briefs lawyers. And she litigates. \"Ukraine courts don't work,\" Eugenia says. \"We have to go overseas.\"</p> <p>When we meet she is in London talking to lawyers as she takes action in the British courts against Ukraine's first deputy prosecutor. In&#xa0;March, Renat Kuzmin told BBC Ukraine that he had \"reliable information\" that money from her mother's accounts had been transferred to pay hitmen who had gunned down MP and businessman Yevgen Shcherban, as&#xa0;well as his wife and his assistant, at an airport in 1996. \"She has never been questioned, and this allegation has no basis in fact,\" Eugenia says, toying with her pasta. One senses that this lapsed restaurateur now rarely finishes a meal.</p> <p>Eugenia comes across as a mixture of relentless focus \u2013 displaying her mastery of the legal and political minefield that confronts her mother \u2013 and the restless stress of somebody who wishes that she could wake up to find that this was all a bad dream.</p> <p>Her mother first gained international prominence in 2004 as one of the leaders of the Orange Revolution that freed her country from the Soviet empire. Alongside Viktor Yushchenko, who survived a near-fatal dioxin poisoning attack that disfigured his face, Tymoshenko \u2013 famous for her golden blonde braid, worn like a crown around her head, and her wardrobe of expensive peasant chic \u2013 was a figurehead for hundreds of thousands of revolutionaries who braved sub-zero temperatures in Kiev to protest against a fraud-tainted presidential election \"won\" by Viktor Yanukovych. The Supreme Court ordered a rerun and Yushchenko was elected to the presidency.</p> <p>\"Those days were incredibly exciting,\" says Eugenia. \"It seemed like the end of all the political troubles for Ukraine. We could move towards becoming a member of a free and democratic Western Europe.\" Yushchenko appointed Eugenia's mother as prime minister, but their dalliance with democracy and each other did not last long. Eight months later they fell out over bitter accusations of corruption. Yushchenko sacked Tymoshenko during a live TV address to the nation in September 2005 and the following year brought in Viktor Yanukovych, of all people, as his new prime minister. \"It was then that I began to fear for my mother,\" Eugenia says.</p> <p>Ukraine has been through 15 premiers since that first flush of independence. It is a country where political alliances are notoriously short-lived and morph very quickly into acrimony and revenge. However, Viktor Yanukovych and Yulia Tymoshenko share a history and a loathing that runs deep even by Ukrainian standards. Did Eugenia or her father not try to persuade her to stay away from a political tide that was turning strongly against her?</p> <p>\"Ten years ago maybe we could have,\" Eugenia says, her dark eyes momentarily staring into the middle distance. \"But now she sees her fight as a fight for Ukraine.\"</p> <p>Born in 1960, Yulia Tymoshenko was an economist and engineer who, with her husband Oleksandr, built a fortune with their now-defunct corporation United Energy Systems Ukraine (UESU), a gas-trading concern which also included venture capital firms and two banks. The rise of UESU was meteoric \u2013 some said suspicious. By the end of 1996, under the patronage of then-prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko, the company controlled 25% of the Ukrainian economy. According to the Ukrainian newspaper&#xa0;<em>Izvestia</em>, UESU was a kind of a \"state within a state\".</p> <p>One of the wealthiest businesspeople in the country, Tymoshenko entered politics in the 1990s. Blessed with incredible willpower and energy \u2013 and a hard edge behind her trademark smile \u2013 \"Lady Yu\" could work a crowd like nobody else. When a rival in parliament claimed that if she sold her pearls they would raise enough cash to feed an average Ukrainian family for five years, she ripped off her necklace and threw it at him. \"There's not a single pearl in this necklace,\" she shouted.</p> <p>Her fall from power was just as dramatic. Five years on from the Orange Revolution, president Yuschenko's popularity had vanished. The 2010 presidency battle was instead fought between the old regime's Yanukovych and Tymoshenko, with Yanukovych narrowly prevailing. Tymoshenko challenged the result in court and continued to protest even after the election had been deemed free and fair. Yanukovych demanded her resignation as prime minister; her government resigned after a parliamentary vote of no confidence.</p> <p>Almost immediately the justice department moved against her, reopening an old case of tax evasion and amassing evidence to put her on trial for Shcherban's murder. The case which made it to the courts first concerned a major contract signed with Russia in 2009 to import gas. Tymoshenko was accused of exceeding her powers by forcing the state company, Naftogaz, to agree to a deal that overpriced the gas, and of costing the country \u00a3120 million.</p> <p>In July 2011 Eugenia was in court to see her mother in the dock and Yushchenko giving evidence against her. Tymoshenko was found guilty in October and ordered to repay the \u00a3120m in damages. \"Nobody can humiliate my honest name,\" she insisted as she began her sentence in Women's Prison No 54 in Kharkiv, 300 miles east of Kiev.</p> <p>Knowing his own arrest was imminent, her husband Oleksandr fled to the Czech Republic and was granted political asylum. \"By the time of my mother's conviction nearly a dozen of her associates had been arrested and some jailed,\" Eugenia says. \"To see your mother sent to prison is horrible, unbearable. Equally, I was not surprised. It was Yanukovych's verdict, not the court's.\"</p> <p>For Eugenia, the key to protecting her mother \u2013 and obtaining her release \u2013 is keeping her fate present on the global stage. For that she had the advantage of an international upbringing. Eugenia had spent nine years in England, boarding at Rugby School and studying at LSE. Shielded from Ukraine's poverty by her family wealth, Eugenia was not immune from her mother's searing ambition: \"She always wanted me to be a good student, to be top of my class. At the beginning it was hard to keep up to her standards.\" Eugenia smiles. \"My father is not so strict. With him I always found a good ear.\"</p> <p>In 2004 she met Sean Carr, a heavily tattooed biker from Leeds and aspiring rock singer with the Death Valley Screamers, in a&#xa0;Red Sea bar in Egypt. She married him a year later. Eleven years older than Eugenia, Carr was suddenly ranked the ninth \"most influential foreigner in Ukraine\" by the <em>Kiev Post</em>. In the land of the Orange Revolution his rock career soared. It did not last. \"I got divorced last year,\" Eugenia says matter-of-factly. Children? \"No children.\" A pause. She will not be drawn on whether campaigning for her mother's release was a contributory factor to her marriage breakdown. When pressed she says: \"This interview is about my mother.\"</p> <p>In December Eugenia was invited to address the annual congress of the European People's Party, the largest centre-right grouping in the European Parliament, to which her mother's party is aligned. She took to the stage nervously clutching her speech and faced 1,000 delegates from 39 countries, including Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel. \"It was terrifying!\" she remembers.</p> <p>Eugenia was concerned about her mother's health: Yulia had a herniated disc in her back. \"She is denied painkillers and can no longer walk,\" Eugenia told the delegates. \"Even the priest cannot see her. She is suffering tortures. I'm scared that this torture will continue until it kills her.\" A week later a video appeared on Ukrainian TV of Tymoshenko bedridden in prison, a shadow of herself and protesting at being filmed against her will. It went viral on the web. International opinion began to rally.</p> <p>This February Eugenia met Hillary Clinton in Washington DC. \"She came over as soon as she saw me and said: 'We really support your mother and we are very worried about her.' Mrs Clinton is a very warm person. I asked if she could put pressure to get my mother treated medically. She spoke to Yanukovych twice and said he had admitted that it was wrong to deny her medical help.\" Two months later, prison officers came to Tymoshenko's cell at 11pm, turned out the lights, wrapped her in a blanket and took her to hospital in Kharkiv. Once she was there, photographs showed severe bruising on her arms and stomach. She alleged she had been beaten en route.</p> <p>\"She was not allegedly beaten,\" Eugenia says fiercely. \"She was hit so hard she could not breathe!\" Hillary Clinton protested and Tymoshenko herself went on hunger strike for 20 days, losing 10kg. Eugenia was horrified. \"I tried to persuade her not to. She was already so weak. But she said: 'Stay strong!'\"</p> <p>Eugenia says the endless travelling, lobbying and media interviews are physically and emotionally draining, but not as stressful as seeing her mother. She might still be in a hospital but Yulia Tymoshenko is kept in isolation behind three sets of bars. \"We hug and hold hands but we can only talk in whispers. Her room on the ninth floor is bugged. There are three cameras on her 24 hours a day, including her bathroom. She has the same prison guards who can walk in unannounced at any time. She has very limited communication with the outside world. She could not even call me on my birthday.\" Eugenia pauses. \"We do have good days,\" she continues. German doctors have been allowed to treat her mother. \"Her back is still painful but her health has improved,\" Eugenia says.</p> <p>Does Eugenia fear for her own safety? \"I have never been involved in politics or my parents' business. If Yanukovych goes against me, it will be very obvious,\" she shrugs. \"I know they watch me and intercept my calls, but I also know I have done nothing wrong. I am in the best position to speak out.\"</p> <p>Thanks to Eugenia the Tymoshenko case has been a PR disaster for Yanukovych's government. In May 2012 it had to cancel a meeting of regional leaders at Yalta when Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy and 10 other EU countries pulled out in protest. Ukraine did co-host the Euro 2012 football championship in June with Poland, but the British, German, Austrian and Belgian governments said that no ministers or officials would attend matches in Ukraine.</p> <p>Supporters portray Tymoshenko as an Aung San Suu Kyi figure. However, her ability to attract and antagonise in equal measure makes her more like Benazir Bhutto, twice prime minister of Pakistan, who was charged by her president with corruption and money-laundering, and assassinated in 2007. When Tymoshenko was taken from the court to prison her supporters were on the street, but so were her detractors, shouting: \"Keep her in a prison. She is a thief!\"</p> <p>Eugenia insists that her mother is a tireless campaigner against repression and corruption. But there are question marks against Tymoshenko's own behaviour. According to the respected Washington-based Freedom House, which visited Ukraine in 2012, for instance, Yanukovych has spent $100m on an extravagant presidential retreat. So why in two stints as prime minister did Tymoshenko not do something about it? \"My mother had a lot of responsibility to bring change to Ukraine,\" Eugenia says, \"but she did not have sufficient instruments to bring it through and had to focus on problems with the economy.\" However, it was a lack of economic focus that led to Ukraine going broke and having to limp to the west for loans that killed the Orange Revolution.</p> <p>The European Court of Human Rights has held an initial public hearing into the \"admissibility and merits in the case of Tymoshenko v Ukraine\". It is now deliberating behind closed doors. It might take months to pronounce, and even if it does find in her favour, a guilty verdict in the tax evasion or the murder cases could see Yulia Tymoshenko remain behind bars for many years.</p> <p>Eugenia is convinced that her mother will return to public life. \"I think she will be with us this year,\" she says, although it is unlikely that Lady Yu will be free before parliamentary elections on 28 October \u2013 Tymoshenko supporters fear they cannot win with their figurehead behind bars. \"I don't worry about her political life; I worry about her health. We are all fighting for her. My dad and I are sending food and clothes parcels but we are doing it separately.\" Eugenia misses her family. \"In May my grandfather died, and I was the only one who could go to his funeral. I just want us to all be together.</p> <p>\"The government wants the world to forget her. I'm not going to let that happen.\"</p>",
  "<p>The first thought to strike anyone stumbling upon the now-infamous <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> video on YouTube without knowing anything about it would probably be that it makes Monty Python's <em>The Life of Brian</em> look like the work of Merchant Ivory. It's daft, amateurish beyond belief and, well, totally weird. So the notion that such a fatuous production might provoke carnage in distant parts of the world seems preposterous.</p> <p>And yet it did. In the process, the video created numerous headaches for a US administration struggling to deal with the most turbulent part of the world. But it also raised some tricky questions about the role that commercial companies play in regulating free speech in a networked world \u2013 questions that will remain long after <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> has been forgotten.</p> <p>European commentators have smugly observed that the kerfuffle shows how little the Arab world understands the idea of free speech. Actually, what it shows is the gulf that separates the US from the rest of the world, including Europe. If the video had surfaced on a hosting site based in the UK, for example, it would have been taken down for incitement to religious hatred.</p> <p>But the first amendment to the US constitution provides a different kind of legal environment. The Obama administration was therefore not in a position to ban the video so it took the route of trying to persuade Google, YouTube's owner, that it violated YouTube's rules. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/world/middleeast/google-wont-rethink-anti-islam-videos-status.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Google declined</a> the request 10 days ago, saying that the video did not violate its terms of service regarding hate speech. The video would remain online because it was against the Islam religion but not Muslim people.</p> <p>So far, so good. But then Google appeared to undermine its own argument by announcing that it had blocked access to the video in some countries. Access was denied in India and Indonesia because it violated local laws in those jurisdictions, but it was also blocked in Egypt and Libya\u201a not because it violated their laws but because of \"the delicacy of the situation\".</p> <p>At this point, even those who are not constitutional lawyers begin to smell a rat. Here we have a commercial company effectively making editorial judgments. If Google were a publisher, like, say, the <em>New York Times</em>, then the question of whether it should or should not publish the video could be trashed out via an established channel \u2013 the courts. But Google is not a publisher: it's something else entirely \u2013 an <em>intermediary</em> \u2013 a type of entity that's increasingly common nowadays and includes Facebook, Twitter and, oddly enough, Amazon.</p> <p>So we're now in new and uncharted territory, nicely described by one legal scholar, Eoin O'Dell, on <a href=\"http://www.cearta.ie/2012/09/youtube-facebook-and-the-responsibilities-of-intermediary-gatekeepers/\" title=\"\">his blog</a>: \"First, in the online world, where most of us access the internet through a range of intermediaries, government censorship does not necessarily need to target the disfavoured speech; it need only target the intermediaries. Very few US companies would feel able to decline a request like that from the White House, and Google are to be commended for standing firm in those circumstances. Second, these intermediaries now have a great deal of practical power over online expression\u201a not only can they be co-opted by government as agents of state censorship but they also have the capacity to act as censors in their own rights, as Google did in their unilateral action to block access in the Middle&#xa0;East.\"</p> <p>Oddly enough, this issue surfaced first in relation to Amazon, which most people think of only as a retailer, but which also provides cloud-computing services that make it an intermediary. During the \"Cablegate\" controversy, when WikiLeaks came under sustained cyber-attack, the site was moved to Amazon's EC2 cloud service on the grounds that the company's infrastructure could withstand any level of attack. But the relief offered was temporary because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-website-cables-servers-amazon\" title=\"\">Amazon summarily ejected WikiLeaks</a> from its servers following outraged statements by some US politicians, notably Senator Joe Lieberman and vice-president Biden. Amazon claimed that it had ejected WikiLeaks simply because it was violating its service's terms and conditions.</p> <p>Oh yeah? The Obama administration knew that a direct order to Amazon would not have survived a First Amendment challenge. But they guessed that the same effect could be achieved through a public statement by an official, executed by \"voluntary\" action of a private company.</p> <p>What this means, as the legal scholar Yochai Benkler <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/02/22/harvard-law-prof-amazons-wikileaks-shutdown-set-dangerous-precedent/\" title=\"\">has pointed out</a>, is that the safeguards to free speech ensured by the first amendment to the US constitution might not count for much in a public sphere built entirely of privately owned infrastructure.</p> <p>Facebook \u2013 or YouTube, for that matter \u2013 may look like public spaces but when it comes to the crunch they offer no more freedom of speech than the average shopping mall.</p>",
  "<h2>Rob Penn, writer and author of <em>It's All About the Bike: the Pursuit of Happiness on Two Wheels</em></h2> <p>It depends, of course, on where we're cycling and who's pushing the pedals. Is it dangerous to ride along a disused railway line in the Peak District? No. Is it too dangerous to ride down the Euston Road at rush hour? Not for me, but I've ridden a bike most days of my adult life.</p> <p>I found the report this week about the rise in \"cycle deaths\" in 2012 very upsetting. But the news emboldens me to cycle more, and encourage others to do the same, rather than lock my bikes away in the shed and drive a car.</p> <p>Two years ago I was in Portland, Oregon, where a quiet cycling revolution is under way. There are now more transport journeys by bicycle per capita in Portland than in any other large American city. A journalist there told me that a turning point in the safety of cyclists on the roads comes when everyone who drives knows someone who cycles: it could be your neighbour's daughter or a work colleague on that bike, which influences how you drive. We're a long way from that point in the UK, but the more people that cycle, the closer we get, and the more legitimate the campaign for safer cycling becomes.</p> <h2>Gerhard Weiss, development officer at the London Cycling Campaign</h2> <p>We certainly should not take news about people being killed while cycling as a reason not to ride a bike. But the hazards that cyclists are exposed to and that put people off cycling in the first place are real. Statistically you should be absolutely fine on Euston Road. But what the statistics hide is the impact even a minor collision has on people who are not encased in a metal box. It can easily cause life-changing injury without ending up as a statistic. Even a near miss or just the sheer aggression one might experience on our streets is clearly enough for too many people to give up cycling or to cycle less than they would like to.</p> <p>I disagree with the notion that everything is fine and people who are not cycling because they are too scared of motor traffic are either making it up or should just get on with it. There is huge capacity to improve our streets, not just for cycling but for everyone, by making them better for cycling. This will involve behaviour-change measures, but the way we design our streets has a big role to play and would also affect behaviour. We cannot accept conditions as they are.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> Don't forget, it's also dangerous to drive a car, and be a pedestrian.</p> <p>Part of the problem in the UK is that pro-cycling advocates compare our plight to the promised land \u2013 the two-wheel tranquillity of Copenhagen or Amsterdam. Our situation is very different: we're densely populated and space on our roads is heavily contested. Also the bicycle was overlooked in transport and planning policy for half a century. Yet I just don't think the situation across the UK is that bad. I've ridden a bike in over 40 countries. Cycling across Delhi or Jakarta or Tehran \u2013 now that is terrifying. Cycling across London is not.</p> <p>Granted, the status quo is not acceptable. We have to keep pressing for better infrastructure, greater motorist awareness of cyclists and institutional acceptance of the bicycle as a valid form of transportation. But my concern is that by making all the noise about the dangers of cycling in the UK, that noise discourages people from cycling rather than reducing the danger itself. \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" as President Roosevelt said. Would it be better to shout about the pleasures and benefits of cycling, and work to improve cycling safety sotto voce?</p> <p><strong>GW</strong> Yearning for the promised land is perhaps part of human nature. But cycle provision in the Netherlands or Copenhagen has a much more practical, down-to-earth appeal. Cycling is a key element in transport planning and feeling safe, an element of carefreeness akin to using public transport, is part of it. It means everyone is empowered to choose cycling, the hurdles are taken away.</p> <p>I agree that space on our streets is often heavily contested, but that's not dissimilar to Amsterdam. And you hit the nail on the head that the bicycle was for too long the UK's forgotten mode of transport. It was of course a mistake that has to be rectified, which will take a lot of work.</p> <p>I'm afraid arguing that all is fine in the UK because there are places in the world where cycling is really dangerous just won't do. We have a duty to shout about street designs that cause danger to people on bikes. Whilst a junction itself, being inanimate, is not dangerous, it is often designed in a way that encourages dangerous behaviour. Unfortunately the media is sometimes too happy to just run with the simplistic \"cycling is dangerous\" message.</p> <p><strong>RP</strong> I'm not sure the majority of people who use public transport would attest to feeling \"carefree\", but changing gear a little here \u2026 When I first commuted in London in the early 90s, the bicycle was a pest. There was an overt sense of cyclists versus motorists on the city streets. Riding a bike could feel like an act of anarchy. In the intervening years, health concerns, transport issues, the&#xa0;environment, the price of oil and the profile of cycle sport have driven the bicycle back to the centre of public consciousness in the UK. There is a whisper that we might even be at the dawn of a new golden age of the bicycle. I certainly think so. You and your colleagues should give yourself a pat on the back for being a part of that.</p> <p>Right now, though, we need to keep transmitting a positive message, a message that extols the utilitarian, democratic virtues of the bicycle, a message that encourages people to wheel their steeds out of the garage and into the sunshine. Which brings me back to my first point: if you increase the number of cyclists, it becomes safer to cycle. Various road safety studies in US cities bear this out. The nub, then, is how best to encourage people to ride. Exhorting the dangers of cycling is not the best&#xa0;way.</p> <p><strong>GW</strong> I would hate to live in a society where we are driven to ride a bicycle because of economic and environmental pressures. Nor would I simply bank on the safety in numbers concept and thereby rely on the brave to pave the way. To me it would be a sign of a truly civilised society when people choose to cycle because it feels like the obvious, safe and convenient choice. For this I think the approach needs to be more multi-faceted and requires positive promotion as well as better and safer street design. Perhaps most importantly bicycle traffic needs to enter our planning at a strategic level.</p> <p>Yes, it is important how we balance the public message. And it would be ridiculous to tell people not to cycle until all streets are super-safe. Many more people could enjoy cycling right&#xa0;now.</p> <p>There is no doubt that cycling in London has become much more pleasurable over the last decade. A recent visitor from Vienna was impressed by how courteous drivers are in London, can you imagine! However, improvements are still patchy not just within London but across the UK.</p> <p>A new golden age for the bicycle? Bring it on.</p>",
  "<p>There is nothing easier, at times of crisis, than to make sweeping generalisations and place whole groups, nationalities and religions into convenient boxes. After the latest spate of deadly protests in Muslim countries against a crude video mocking Muhammad, the debate over the last two weeks has been dominated by the notion of \"Muslim rage\". Coincidentally, these events have occurred just at the moment that Salman Rushdie has published a memoir of a life spent living under an Iranian fatwa that called for his death for his authorship of <em>The Satanic Verses</em>, a book similarly condemned for its perceived offence to Islam.</p> <p>The reality is that these have been, by and large, pretty small affairs although with some tragic consequences, not least the death of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three of his colleagues, as well as a number of protesters in Pakistan and elsewhere. While comparisons are invidious, it is still fair to say, as Syrian activists have remarked, that they have been tiny when put against the daily death toll there.</p> <p>The numbers involved in the demonstrations have also been much lower in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya \u2013 a few thousands when set against the vast numbers who turned out to protest during the Arab Spring.</p> <p>If there is a problem with the way in which these protests have been depicted, it is in precisely the shorthand of \"Muslim rage\" \u2013 the almost racist notion that such a monolithic entity exists. For what has been clear is that while many in Islamic countries might find the notion of a video such as <em>Innocence of Muslims</em> deeply and viscerally offensive, it has inspired a variety of responses. In Libya, it should be noted, a significant number have been as angry over the death of the ambassador, while across the Islamic world there have been as many voices calling for calm as for violence.</p> <p>Indeed, in Libya this weekend, the armed jihadist group in Benghazi blamed by some for Stevens's death was driven out of the city by residents angry over the killings.</p> <p>The reality is that how we view the Islamic world in the west has been conditioned by our own debates over recent years, a cartoon depiction for which sections of both the right and left are equally guilty. On the one hand, Islam is portrayed as a fundamentally violent religion. On the other, Muslims are perpetual victims of a neoimperialist conspiracy with every right to be angry.</p> <p>If both are equally offensive, it is because the Islamic world is as complex and rich with ideas and disputes as the west. Islam as a religion is as full of contradictions and rival schools and sects as Christianity or Judaism. Notions about governance, social justice, human rights \u2013 even freedom of religious expression \u2013 vary by country, province, sometimes even by city. And in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, many of these ideas have become bitterly contested areas of political, religious and social friction.</p> <p>There good historical reasons for Muslims to be angry with the way their countries have been treated by the west and by the US in particular, which has helped prop up dictatorial regimes \u2013 and in the case of Iran by removing a government that threatened its economic interests. But these complaints are not exclusive to the Islamic world. They apply equally in Africa and South America and Asia. Having said that, the west is not alone in having those who are guilty of simplistic ways of looking at Islam. Many in the Islamic world adhere to crude conspiratorial notions of how the wider world functions.</p> <p>Instead, the lessons that need to be drawn from the last two weeks are far more complex than endless arguments about perception of offence of the sacred, the nature of Islam and limits of free speech. These protests have been as much about local issues in the countries where they have occurred, not least in the way they have been seized upon by ultra-conservative Salafist movements often in competition with more moderate Islamist parties for influence in the new political space that has emerged following the Arab Spring.</p> <p>Because the alternative to a mature and nuanced understanding of the Islamic world is that the west continues to view a large percentage of the global population through the language of hostility alone, rather than perceiving the nuances and differences and areas where conversation and agreement is possible. And that is where conflict, inevitably, resides.</p> <p><em>Comments will be on this later</em></p>",
  "<p>Far from green shoots bursting forth, Lee Hopley, chief economist of manufacturers' group the EEF, sees a shadow falling over British industry. \"It feels like the mood has shifted down over the last quarter: the dark clouds do appear to be gathering,\" she says.</p> <p>Recession in the eurozone, the slowdown in China and the risk that America is heading for a \"fiscal cliff\" are all making exporters nervous, while demand at home remains relatively weak, she argues. The latest official figures showed that manufacturing output in July was 0.5% lower than a year earlier \u2013 though recent surveys show a modest pick-up in confidence.</p> <p>Individual manufacturers echo Hopley's assessment. \"There's been no further drop-off in demand; but if we saw any further drop-off, the patient would be dead,\" says James Greenham, managing director of EMS Physio, which sells hi-tech equipment for physiotherapists from its base just outside Oxford.</p> <p>\"I certainly don't see any uplift in business for the UK,\" he says. Many of his products are for export, which makes EMS exactly the sort of manufacturer Vince Cable is trying to encourage; but Greenham says most markets are seeing a slowdown.</p> <p>\"There's still demand from certain parts of the world \u2013 the Middle East and Asia \u2013 but I'm not aware of any country where the distributor is saying, 'things are brilliant'.\"</p> <p>Having lost out on an \u00a38,000 NHS contract to an overseas rival, Greenham would like to see the government using its procurement budget to back British firms.</p> <p>For Andrew Churchill, the managing director of precision engineering firm JJ Churchill, based in Leicestershire with 130 employees, the situation changes depending on which part of his industry you look at. \"We're seeing a very mixed picture,\" he says.</p> <p>In defence, lead-in times are so long that orders are still bouncing back from the recession of 2008-09. \"We made massive reinvestment during the recession ... and we're well placed to benefit from the recovery.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the parts his firm manufactures for giant diesel engines, though, business has declined by a third; yet the civil aerospace business is still \"brisk\", as is the car industry, where the expansion of Jaguar Land Rover, for example, has had knock-on benefits throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>Churchill would like to see the government take kick-starting growth more seriously. \"From my perspective, I support Osborne's fiscal mandate, and I think the deficit is very important; but we haven't seen any effect with regards to stimulating growth: there's an economic mandate that's missing.\"</p> <p>Green shoot rating \u2605</p> <h2>Banking</h2> <p>By the end of this month, Royal Bank of Scotland will have paid \u00a32.5bn in fees for the insurance it bought from the government to insure its most toxic assets. Three years after joining the asset protection scheme, the bailed-out bank is expected to withdraw from it in the coming weeks after surviving the downturn without having to make a claim on the policy that played such a vital role in keeping it afloat in the dark days of the crisis.</p> <p>That is one green shoot, perhaps, for a banking industry that was brought to its knees four years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p> <p>But as Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, points out, it is hardly a major step, given that the taxpayer will still be left with an 81% stake in the Edinburgh-based bank. That stake, which once stood closer to 84%, has only been falling because the bank is issuing new shares to outside investors, thereby diluting the government stake.</p> <p>Similarly, the taxpayer stake in Lloyds Banking Group has fallen to just below 40% as a result of the issue of new shares. It is hardly a healthy picture, but in the past two months the share prices of many banks have enjoyed a minor rally \u2013 a sign perhaps that the worst may be over for an industry that has more recently been saddled with scandals ranging from attempting to rig the Libor rate to laundering money for drug barons in Mexico.</p> <p>Yet the launch of the Funding for Lending programme by George Osborne, aimed at getting more credit into the economy, is further evidence that the banking industry is still not functioning normally. Lending by banks to small businesses has continued to decline. The Federation of Small Businesses last week said that 42% of firms seeking loans were being turned down. Meanwhile, BDRC Continental's quarterly SME Finance Monitor found that only 43% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) used external finance such as a bank loan, compared with 51% just three months earlier.</p> <p>The moribund state of the lending market has prompted critics of the banking industry to call for greater state control. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott says: \"There can be no sustainable green shoots while the big banks, and critically RBS, are starving small firms of finance\".</p> <p>RBS and Lloyds are already subject to major restructuring programmes to reduce their riskiness. This is a positive sign, while the low interest rate environment is helping to keep bank's provisions for bad debts down, despite an economic environment that should suggest an increase of customers in trouble.</p> <p>But for banks, there is not much sign that their businesses are growing. \"Things might be getting less worse,\" says Gordon \u2013 but he adds that any improvement is \"based on falling bad debts and costs and not on a revenue&#xa0;story\".</p> <p><strong>Green shoot rating </strong>\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Hotels</h2> <p>At the 16-room <a href=\"http://www.seaspraybrighton.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sea Spray hotel near Brighton's seafront</a>, where a bed for the night can cost anything from \u00a349 to \u00a3285 (if you opt for the Manhattan penthouse with whirlpool bath) Simon Etheridge is feeling festive. \"We've already taken a booking for Christmas this morning,\" he says.</p> <p>During the long, soggy summer of sport, there were apocalyptic anecdotes of hotels and restaurants standing empty as Brits stayed at home to watch the Olympics and overseas visitors avoided the country because of warnings of transport chaos. Earnings from foreign visitors to Britain were 6% lower in July than the same month last year; but there are hopes that business will pick up in the autumn.</p> <p>In Brighton, Etheridge insists, \"business has been great\". In the West Country, Nicci Clarke of <a href=\"http://www.139bath.co.uk/about_onethreenine.asp\" title=\"\">One Three Nine</a> 139, an upmarket bed-and-breakfast in Bath, also says that trade this year has been \"quite good actually\" \u2013 and she's already taken some advance bookings for Boxing Day onwards.</p> <p>Alessandra Pino, of the Italian restaurant <a href=\"http://www.locandalocatelli.com/\" title=\"\">Locanda Locatelli</a> in London, says business was good even during the Olympics, and she too is upbeat about December. \"The Christmas season is normally when the restaurant is at its fullest and we expect this year to be no different.\" But not everyone is so confident: Anthony Flinn of <a href=\"http://www.anthonysrestaurant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Anthony's restaurant in Leeds</a> says it's been a \"very hard year,\" with the number of diners up, but total takings down, as customers economised.</p> <p>One reason for optimism is that inflation has been falling steadily, from its peak above 5% last autumn to 2.5% in August. That should help to ease the squeeze on families' finances, which has been restraining spending \u2013 and which the Office for Budget Responsibility has cited as one of the key reasons for repeatedly downgrading its growth forecasts.</p> <p>Wages are rising at an average rate of less than 2% a year, according to the Office for National Statistics, so real incomes are still declining; but a marginally slower squeeze may still help tempt consumers to loosen their purse strings, and pop out for a family meal, or a weekend break. As Flinn says, \"we live in hope\".</p> <p><strong>Green shoot rating </strong>\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <h2>Housing market</h2> <p>George Osborne's radical Funding for Lending scheme, offering cut-price state-backed loans to the banks, is directly aimed at cutting the cost of mortgages for ordinary borrowers. It was only launched last month, but with employment picking up in some parts of Britain, estate agents are reporting a more positive mood abroad.</p> <p>David Baker of David Baker &amp; Co in the Vale of Glamorgan says the local housing market is the \"best it's been for three years\".</p> <p>In Exeter, Hannah Edge of Strutt and Parker says business was quiet during the summer as potential house-hunters stayed at home to watch the Olympics. With the Games out of the way, however, she says, \"the last two weeks have been busier\". Philip Hiatt, boss of Your Move Philip Hiatt in West Sussex, echoes her assessment, saying: \"September has been a lot busier than the summer.\" He adds that the property market is \"not as bad as it is perceived\".</p> <p>So far there is little sign that cheaper loans and stronger levels of business in high street estate agents are feeding through to house prices, however. While the average cost of a London home has continued to rise, buoyed by strong demand from foreign buyers looking for a safe haven from the turmoil in the eurozone, in most parts of the UK prices are moving sideways or falling.</p> <p>The latest Nationwide house price index showed prices down 0.7% on a year earlier in August. The regional breakdown, last published in June, showed prices falling in nine of 13 regions nationwide.

  "<p>A man steps across the floor of what seems to be a basement or dungeon, on a film shot by a wobbly, handheld camera. Blood, sticky underfoot, runs beneath his boots \u2013 and the camera catches what seems to be a severed head. The scene is being played on a computer screen, watched by an intense young man, transfixed. A beautiful girl looks also, over his shoulder. \"Is that Iraq?\", she asks, squirming at the degenerate and apparently gratuitous cruelty. \"Mexico,\" replies the man with a grunt, clearly terrified himself. Welcome to the latest film by Hollywood's \u2013 even America's \u2013 heretic-in-chief, Oliver Stone. Unsurprisingly, this brief exchange is charged with greater meaning than it appears at first sight, and the film's director has come to elaborate.</p> <p>The physical presence of Oliver Stone is not unlike that of his impact on cinema over the last four decades. He is immediately contrapuntal: tanned leathery skin, khaki waistcoat and black boots in the seamless, breezy tranquillity of a grandiose hotel in Berlin, answering waiters' questions in polite German with a growl, complimenting the pretty-prim waitress on her looks with a gravelly chuckle. And when he gets down to the business of explaining his new film \u2013 sleeves rolled up, hair like that of an old rocker (which he is) \u2013 there is no polite prologue to the heresy. \"Yeah, this is one of America's wild wars that never ends and ain't going anywhere: the war on drugs.\" After all, this is the man who has \u2013 famously or infamously, depending on who you are \u2013 subverted and scorned every norm, rhyme and reason on which the narrative of the US political establishment (and America's strut in the world) is premised, his canon thereby so much greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36343/platoon\" title=\"\"><em>Platoon</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89121/born.on.the.fourth.of.july\" title=\"\"><em>Born on the Fourth of July</em></a> were pivotal contributions to America's attempt at reckoning with its own self-generated catastrophe in Vietnam; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77907/jfk\" title=\"\"><em>JFK</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/61568/nixon\" title=\"\"><em>Nixon</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/09/w-review\" title=\"\"><em>W.</em></a> retold and revolutionised received wisdom on the death of one president and the lives of two others. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/oct/01/drama\" title=\"\"><em>World Trade Center</em></a> rescued the human story of 9/11 from that manipulated by Washington for its own reasons.</p> <p>Perhaps most cogently of all, with hindsight, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/117586/salvador\" title=\"\"><em>Salvador</em></a>, from 1986, was among very few films or mainstream expressions of any kind which looked at the dirty war that ravaged the Americas during the 1980s through a Latin American lens, repositioning President Reagan's role as more that of jackboot than sponsor of the freedom he claimed to be spreading, through alliances with dictators and death squads. And more recently, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131532/south-of-the-border\" title=\"\"><em>South of the Border</em></a> stood and stands as the only attempt of its kind to document a new dynamic across the hemisphere, and the rise of newly confident leftwing leaders in the Latin Americas, unbowed by the colossus, the US. Stone's latest, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146822/savages\" title=\"\"><em>Savages</em></a>, is to be seen in that vein \u2013 only the story concerns the country that is a mere 20 minutes walk from Texas across the Rio Grande, and just south of the border from the golden beaches of San Diego. It addresses the first war of the 21st century (which gives us a glimpse of what the rest of it may well look like), the narco cartel war in Mexico.</p> <p>Of course Stone is drawn to this: Mexico's war \u2013 if that is what it is \u2013 has claimed 50,000 lives, and has done so with striking and baffling cruelty. \"A lot of these people have died slowly,\" says Stone, approaching his theme. \"I didn't want to show people being dissolved in acid, and there are plenty of other things we could have shown but didn't, or had to cut.\"</p> <p>Indeed there are: in his hypothetical but meticulously researched film Stone does not detail the sewing of a flayed face to a soccer ball, or the decapitated bodies left dangling from bridges, mutilated corpses strewn along highways or filling mass graves. Strangely, though, the US media seems as keen to avoid mention of the daily litany of death across its underbelly as it is to cover it; even less does the American establishment want to understand <em>why</em> all this is happening, and consider the possibility that there may be deep-rooted economic causes of at least aspects of Mexico's agony for which the US bears some responsibility, quite apart from its insatiable need to consume drugs and welcome the profits they generate through its banks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KC2zbOwbeEs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KC2zbOwbeEs?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>High time for a major film about all this, in an America which, as Stone says, \"doesn't give a shit\" \u2013 even though the violence is next door and spilling over the US government's fence through the desert, in defiance of Washington's militarisation of the sieve-like border. America wants there to be a wall along the 2,000 miles it shares with Mexico, like the one that once ran beneath the window at which Stone sits in Berlin. But that is not going to happen when the border is also the busiest commercial frontier in the world, crossed by a million people every day.</p> <p>At first sight, Stone may seem to have flinched from making this badly needed film. <em>Savages</em> is not for the most part set in Mexico, not is it overtly about Mexico, as it might have been. It is an adaptation of a novel by the great American writer on the border and drug war, Don Winslow, about two men: Chon, a traumatised veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, and Ben, a karmic botanist par excellence. Their combined experience and knowledge enables them to grow marijuana of unrivalled potency and quality. It also helps them secure the devotion of lovely blonde O, whom they share as a narcotic-erotic <em>m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois</em>.</p> <p>Stone's generic Baja cartel, led by a matriarch called Elena, is set on acquiring the seed if not its growers, and kidnaps O in pursuit of this aim. The boys react heroically, and set out to rescue their woman. In the background is an aspirant <em>deus ex machina</em>, Dennis, a corrupt agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, who works alongside not only Don and Chon, but also the cartel's vicious enforcer on the US side, Lado.</p> <p>There is detail in the film which Stone is the first \u2013 and only one, north of the border \u2013 to grasp, and the detail is important in reading not only this narco war, but also what it means to modern capitalist society. First is the perverse innovation in the cruelty, for its own sake and its recreational aspect. Stone treats us to the execution of a suspected snitch, hung by his wrists and whipped until he confesses (even though he is innocent), after which he is incinerated alive with a tyre around his arms and torso, running in wild circles to his death. During the scene, there's a moment of mastery: the soundtrack, the cackling laughter of those watching. It takes Stone to work that out. Yes, in Mexico's war, this is <em>fun</em>. \"It's getting crueller out there,\" muses Stone. \"It's gone up a level.\"</p> <p>Another insight is the cartels' mastery of the internet and along with it their satanic sense of humour. The tit-for-tat over kidnapped O is conducted largely through cyberspace, and at one point the cartel sends our heroic duo an animated cartoon of the decapitation of their girl. And there is this about the real-life cartels: unlike the Bosnian Serbs or even al-Qaida, they do not need to speak to us, to the media or politicians, except on their terms. They control their message, they do so through their own <em>mantas</em> or banners, sick but funny notes pinned to the more illustrious victims' mutilated corpses, but above all through the internet \u2013 and in doing so they laugh at us. They have no cause to proselytise, nor is there any retort to them \u2013 that is their sick genius, and that is why they laugh. \"Yeah \u2013 that humour thing,\" says Stone. \"It's something else. It takes someone who knows what's going on to understand it, the humour and the cruelty. I was scared of it, but I wanted to make sure I could keep time with what is going on.\"</p> <p>One of Stone's hallmarks, in films such as <em>JFK</em> and <em>W.</em>, is that he make you suspend disbelief so thoroughly that you can be forgiven for thinking you're observing the real thing, not a dramatisation. In <em>Savages</em> Stone has mercilessly captured the horrific details of Mexico's war and it is tempting to ask why he opted for an action movie with rather annoyingly gym-cut Colgate Californians and a Barbie-blonde stoner as its central characters, instead of something that gets us inside Mexico. Inside, if not the Tijuana cartel, which is now, as Stone himself admits, \"dealing with small pocket change\", then a film about those others who are redefining what a narco cartel \u2013 indeed, criminality \u2013 is in the new world and global economy. The paramilitary Zetas, for example, are an entirely new breed of syndicate, utterly ruthless, apparently unstoppable. It seems a shame that even a film by America's most irreverent director (who has looked at the US through a rare Latin American eyepiece) <em>must</em> be centred on the United States. One would like Stone's take on the world's most wanted criminal, Joaqu\u00edn \"Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, fugitive leader of the Sinaloa cartel, or his nemesis, who has overtaken even him for savagery, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, founder of Los Zetas.</p> <p>But actually I am missing the point completely, thinking this way. Stone has a terrifying and convincing thesis as to why the film has to be set in America, with American characters: \"The point,\" he says, \"is that wars come home, they come home to roost. And there are connections: one of the two main guys has come home from Afghanistan and Iraq, and he's brought all that with him, what I think are new levels of cruelty and combat technology we have out there.\"</p> <p>He drives his theme: \"Of course, humankind has always been cruel \u2013 the Third Reich and so on. But I think there are new levels of cruelty, new technologies now, a new ball game. Maybe I'm wrong, but the cruelty level in the world just went up in these recent wars. We get a lot of information about what's happening in Iraq, the Middle East and Afghanistan, which comes back to America with this guy. And who knows how this may influence what's happening in Mexico \u2013 I think it probably does.\"</p> <p>It's a shocking but cogent point about the nature of the violence, and its arrival into our public domain. Stone cut his teeth in Vietnam, where images of violence (the famous girl on the bridge burned by napalm; and scenes from Stone's own films and past as a veteran) were supposed to shock us \u2013 and did. Now, in reality, all that has volte-faced: the Zetas relay their own atrocities on the web as recruiting posters, and in Stone's film, to parley with their proposed business partners. It has been posited before that the Zetas got their ideas for torture and execution videos from al-Qaida, who in turn respond to souvenir photos taken by American troops of their own abuses in Abu Ghraib. Stone, typically, hurls us to the logical, heretical, conclusion.</p> <p>\"This Middle East thing brought it to another level. The barbarism came back in a big way, and it was Bush who started that. It all began with Afghanistan and Iraq. The guy in the movie brings it home; and the cartel brings it home.\"</p> <p>There are cinematic considerations too: \"It's based on Winslow,\" says Stone, \"and we've made it into a thriller. No, I don't think the cartels would work that way with independent marijuana growers in California. No, there aren't any IEDs going off in the Californian desert \u2013 but,\" and he grins with inimitably Stoneian mischief, \"I like the idea!\"</p> <p>Another subtlety is Stone's depiction of the fall of Elena, the matriarch. This occurs as the result of a mutiny by Lado, who has switched sides to a rival, El Azul, and because she comes to California to visit her daughter. Her collapse \u2013 and with it, by implication, that of her cartel \u2013 could signify the arrival of a greater power, a new cartel led by El Azul. This has happened in real life: Guzm\u00e1n has defeated the Tijuana cartel, which was led by one of the first female <em>capos</em>, Enedina Arellano F\u00e9lix. It could be because \"it's tough taking orders from a woman\", observes Stone of Lado. But it could also be seen as Elena's weakness of character, or at least her old-fashioned view of what a cartel's code should be. As Stone puts it: \"She's a good traditional woman. She's proud of the fact that her daughter is ashamed of her. And her fall is the fall of the don. Elena was weak because she had a thing for her daughter and wanted to rescue her.\" This is exactly it: the mutation of Mexico's cartels from the don of old, with his (or her) attachment to family and codes of honour, however criminal or perverse they were, and the transfer of power to those whose only code is raw ruthlessness \u2013 like Guzm\u00e1n or, to an even greater degree, the Zetas.</p> <p>In <em>Savages</em>, the DEA agent Dennis is corrupt and credible. He protects Chon and Ben for money, takes a bribe to deliver them Elena's daughter, and gets to strut and moralise at a press conference when Elena is finally felled \u2013 having himself switched allegiances to El Azul along with his contact, Lado. The role is in part shaped by a former DEA agent Stone hired called Eddie, who had \"30 years experience. He was in the Middle East and he knew the scene in Mexico. I got into the DEA that way \u2013 Eddie took care of us; and getting that kind of insight into the DEA is a big deal.\"</p> <p>Lado is a credible character who \"wants to be an American\", says Stone. \"He takes his kids to little league, his wife worries that he's out last thing at night with his 'gardening business' \u2013 his cover, and of course he has other women. He comes in one night, and she can smell a woman on him and he takes her apart, he rapes her \u2013 but we had to let that scene go.\"</p> <p>Lado \"also has eight or nine chihuahuas at his feet\", observes Stone, and it is a detail to relish though the scene was cut: \"I've been to a couple of these drug lords' places\", he says, \"and it's like ocelots to them. They've got all these hairless chihuahuas, proud of the fact that 'they cost me a fucking fortune'.\"</p> <p>Stone's conclusion focuses less on the economic backdrop in Mexico than the failure of the war on drugs. Stone of course takes this further, entwining his themes. First: \"That border is going all day and all night long. And it's 2,000 miles long. There's no way they're going to stop this. Dammit \u2013 they tried to build a wall across Berlin!\" He gestures out of the window towards Starbucks, where no-man's land used to be: \"Walls don't work, period.\" And second: \"I don't see anything coming out of this so far as the war on drugs is concerned. It's been 40 years now, and its just become a method by which more money can be generated to fight what they now call narco-terror.\" And here's the crux, the entwinement again: \"Drugs and terror, they couple them together, and the drug war becomes part of the war on terror that never ends. Part of the total terror that is overcoming our lives.\"</p> <p>Apart from connections to the Middle East already made, it is impossible to continue in this vein without invoking <em>South of the Border</em> \u2013 indeed it is impossible to discuss any Stone film in isolation from the others.</p> <p><em>South of the Border</em> is a documentary series of interviews with those who are bringing Latin America to a new critical mass, a shift in power vis-a-vis the United States. All of them are elected, leftwing presidents of countries that have been, as Stone puts it, \"in Uncle Sam's backyard\", but which now brandish a new self-confidence, after decades of American puppet regimes: N\u00e9stor and Cristina Kirchner of Argentina, Luiz In\u00e1cio da Silva of Brazil, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Paraguay's Fernando Lugo and, famously, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela.</p> <p>In January 2008, Stone's audacious recent history on the theme of <em>South of the Border</em> began in this newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/06/film.usa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">with an interview he gave</a> the <em>Observer</em> in Bogot\u00e1 in which Stone refused to condemn the Farc guerrillas, with whom he was trying to negotiate the release of three hostages. With him were N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. \"I remember it well!\" he half-laughs now. \"I was on a mission. I wanted to stay low key. N\u00e9stor was there, and Hugo, and the American Red Cross, flying into this shithole of a town. Anyway, the Red Cross helicopter arrives, and, well, it was called off. The Farc people are always wary of the CIA, and I think the Americans just couldn't have Hugo involved in anything that would be a success \u2013 the hostages were released shortly afterwards, after Hugo had gone.\"</p> <p>He reflects now on the wider theme: \"The numbers don't lie. These are countries which have seen growth and real improvements after being failed by neo-liberal economics. The US took the side of the bad guys constantly \u2013 the media covering up so many of the abuses, in Argentina, Chile \u2026 But now, for the first time, these countries have thrown off the stranglehold of the International Monetary Fund and US treasury, which made loans the terms of which were those of what they call the 'neo-liberal Washington consensus' \u2013 [to] not only pay back the loans, but conform their economies to the privatisation of the kind we have here: hospitals, military, prisons. Well, in South America, privatisation did not work, it had disastrous consequences.</p> <p>\"And what they essentially did in the last 10&#xa0;years was to throw off that tyranny. Their people have suffered so much, and they voted in new leaders. But even after they were elected, these people were resented by the US. I've never read one positive word about anything these people have done in the US media \u2013 let's face it, the Americans don't accept the idea of the election of leftwing leaders in their own backyard.\"</p> <p>Accordingly: \"Each one of these leaders has been picked off, one by one, by the United States&#xa0;\u2026 Disunite them, break them off from each other. But they've stood firm, and I think this is an important moment. They've done good for their countries, and I hope they last.\"</p> <p>There is a connection between <em>Savages</em> and another Stone film, in fact two of them: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89165/wall.street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street</em></a> and its recent sequel, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135251/wall-street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</em></a>. Chon and Ben have a money-launderer, a finance geek who has left the big bank for whom he worked. In real life, however, we now know that this would be no freelancer; this would be the man from the bank itself, in suit and tie, protected all the way to the top. The scandal and outrage of major high street banks laundering Mexican drug cartel money has made headlines recently: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/17/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate\" title=\"\">American Wachovia and British HSBC</a> were the first to be named and shamed \u2013 with more on the way \u2013 but the typical fines in such cases fall well short of proper punishment.</p> <p>The banks' direct connections to the cartels' bloody war and the misery of drugs inevitably causes Stone to reflect on his two films about what was once his father's business, in those distant days when, he says \"a bank was something that you saved with, and gave you a loan\". He says of the money-laundering: \"You kind of get a sense of where the real power lies. Gekko [his character in <em>Wall Street</em>] was an 1980s creature. But by 2008-9, the banks had changed. What Gekko was doing in the 1980s, everyone was doing \u2013 rigging things, fixing things \u2013 the outsider Gekko had become the system. Look at them! Making money with the money they took from the public, and gambling with it! You have these huge settlements, with AIG underwriting Goldman Sachs \u2013 and it's all over New York, that level of confidence, that level of arrogance and impunity. You go to the Hamptons, and you feel it.\" And there is an inevitable connection between this financial elite and the corporatisation of government.</p> <p>\"The United States,\" he says, \"has been a corporate-controlled country increasingly since world war two. The concept of a national security state plays into that concept of us as a mega-corporation. I view the Pentagon as essentially a huge corporation. The United States has moved into corporate gridlock, and the gridlock controls us \u2013 the power of the lobbyists, banks, oil companies, pharmaceuticals \u2026 After Reagan triumphed in 1980, we had this embrace of the free market. But it's not a free market really, it's fixed. Because monopolies tend to dominate it, they come to the fore and push everybody out of the way. So it's a rigged playing field, like we saw in 2008 \u2013 the banks getting bigger and bigger.</p> <p>\"And you know the weird thing?\" he asks, as if to the street below, those around the Brandenburg Gate. \"Everyone wants to buy into that shit! The people take their cue from whoever has the power and the money! Go into the Four Seasons in New York, and power is the hero! No one wanted to talk about the poor Vietnamese when this all started, or the poor people in Latin America \u2013 no, we embrace power!\"</p> <p>He goes on: \"I don't think Americans give a shit about out there. They don't understand why in the Middle East everyone hates America. They don't understand the 'backyard'. JFK did, and so did Henry Wallace when he was vice-president. They both tried to turn it round \u2013 and what happened? As soon as JFK was assassinated, Lyndon Johnson said he'd crank it up in Vietnam. In Latin America it was: 'Enough of this Alliance for Progress' shit, what about the $9bn we've got invested down there?'\"</p> <p>Which brings Stone to another subject he wants to talk about; for it never rains, it only pours with this tempest of a man. As <em>Savages</em> premieres, get ready \u2013 at the end of this month \u2013 for the publication of his book and thereafter the 10-part television series (to be shown in Britain next year) on which it is based, <em>The Untold History of the United States</em>. Working with the American University historian Peter Kuznick, Stone has compiled a series which, he says \"is inspired by your British series <em>The World at War</em> \u2013 pure narrative, no talking heads and actors to portray some of the players. Ten one-hour programmes; everything's been fact-checked and now CBS has a copy. It's an unorthodox, true global story about America. About how Truman did not have to drop the atomic bomb that all the kids get taught was dropped to save lives and stop the war. That isn't why it happened, it was so that the world would become a huge amphitheatre for America. It's about the true origins of the cold war, which we all think was started by the Russians when they invaded eastern Europe (he gestures towards the window again, sun glinting off an S-Bahn train trundling through the glorious iron-and-glass station at Friedrichstrasse \u2013 not long ago, the overground platforms were in East Berlin; the underground ones were an interchange for the West Berlin U-Bahn system).</p> <p>\"It's about Truman after the war, a small man, a cold warrior and a political hack. After the war, we tried to demobilise, but it didn't last long. They created this legacy of rightwingers who pulled at this alarm that we were falling behind the Russians. But the Russians never achieved anything like parity \u2013 maybe at the end of the 1970s, but it broke them.\"</p> <p>This is not history for history's sake, however \u2013 this is the history of our present and future, long beyond cold war, into war on terror, war on drugs: \"It's the history,\" says Stone, \"of our building the national security state, which is interested in nobody's security apart from that of the state. Always supposedly falling behind the enemy, so there would be no end to it. It's a legacy thing,\" he pleads, almost. \"The American history our kids are reading is all upside down. Everything is the opposite to what you think.\" With Stone, a conversation can only return to the beginning \u2013 in the best sense \u2013 \"because it is all interconnected\", as are his films. But there is not time \u2013 though he does afford himself a valedictory thought that sends a shiver down the spine.</p> <p>\"This terror that we're supposed to be so terrified of \u2026 What the fuck is it? Why should we all be so scared? Well, there's big money in it, for sure. So now we have every form of technology at the disposal of the government and its war on terror \u2013 but who are we supposed to be terrified of? <em>Why</em> must we be so terrified?\" For want of any further answers to his terrifying rhetorical question about being terrified of terror, Stone affords himself a joke, for like all good heretics, he is a jester too, at the court of America: \"Jeezus!\" He swallows a small bowl of salad dressing, neat, and rises from his chair. \"The idea that the government is doing all this to protect <em>me</em> from <em>marijuana</em>!?\"</p> <p><em>Savages was released on 21 September.

The impoverished Ogoni fishing and farming communities say they still cannot return to work and have received no compensation. They have accused Shell of applying different standards to clean-ups in Nigeria compared with the rest of the world.</p> <p>\"A comprehensive clean-up is yet to get under way and the creeks remain extremely polluted,\" said Martyn Day of the London-based law firm Leigh Day, which represents the 11,000 affected villagers. Day has just returned from the delta, where he was part of a team assessing the clean-up. \"Next to nothing has happened and where work has commenced it has been totally amateurish.\"</p> <p>Shell said it had started pilot clean-up schemes in five affected areas, but claimed it had been refused access to several other polluted sites. It said \"good progress\" had been made, adding that the vast majority of oil spilt in the Bodo area was the result of criminal activity including theft, sabotage and illegal oil refining by villagers.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria said: \"SPDC is committed to cleaning up all spills, no matter what the cause, from its facilities. The real tragedy of the Niger delta is the widespread and continual criminal activity, including sabotage, theft and illegal refining, that leads to the vast majority of oil being spilled. It is this criminality which blights the Niger delta and which all organisations with an interest in Nigeria's future should focus their efforts on highlighting and dealing with.\"</p> <p>Amnesty International disputed Shell's reason for delaying the clean-up. Audrey Gaughran, interim Africa programme director, said: \"Shell says the oil pollution visible at Bodo today is due to sabotage, and not the two major spills of 2008, which it accepts were due to leaks in its pipeline. But there is no evidence to support Shell's statement.</p> <p>\"Amnesty International has shared with Shell all of our evidence \u2013 including video footage, photos, satellite images taken over relevant time periods. By contrast, although we have asked Shell for evidence to support their claim of sabotage, they have never responded.\"</p> <p>Last year Ogoni chiefs demanded Shell put in \"a serious level\" of resources and appoint an internationally known clean-up company to oversee the pro-cess. But Shell has said it would use its own contractors and has proposed to phase in the clean-up over several years. It has now appointed its own monitor.</p> <p>Day said: \"Shell seems to be trying to undertake the clean-up on the cheap which will mean the people will be left with the aftermath for generations.\"</p> <p>Best practice requires all oil recovered to be stored in temporary facilities until it can be disposed of properly. Instead, surface oil has been poured into pits and covered with sand. Local communities say Shell's contractors have so far failed in a number of respects including cleaning mangrove forests and refusing to employ local labour. They say buried polluted soil next to the shoreline is already leaking.</p> <p>Following a three-year peer-reviewed study funded by Shell, the UN environment programme reported last year that oil pollution on the delta was worse than expected. It urged a $1bn clean-up of the whole region.</p> <p>Shell has still not agreed financial compensation for the 11,000 people affected.</p>",

Nick Clegg, Tim Farron and Jo Swinson can certainly work a crowd, although some of the more minor names on stage tonight were pretty dire. That's it from me for for the day - Andy will be back at the crack of dawn with more tomorrow. Here's an evening summary before I go.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Nick Clegg closed the first day of the Lib Dem conference in Brighton with a challenge to Labour to apologise for its economic policies and \"illegal\" Iraq war, an attack on the Tories for trying to impose a \"turbo-charged rightwing agenda\" on the country, praise for the fact the Olympics showed a Britain at ease with multiculturalism and a number of good jokes at his own expense.</strong> Bizarrely, however, party president Tim Farron \u2013 who says he hopes to replace Clegg one day \u2013 appeared not to have been briefed on his party leader's speech in advance. His own speech, made before Clegg's, joked that lines about the Olympics would become a \"tedious\" cliche of conference season, and asked Labour to apologise for its economic policies and the Iraq war, forcing Clegg to add the line \"but Tim is right\" to his own remarks.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Clegg said the Lib Dems were going to \"hold [their] nerve\" and press on with their five-year programme.</strong> Clegg's personal ratings, and the party's as a whole, are very poor, but as the conference starts Clegg has been stressing his determination to fight the next election as Lib Dem leader and there seems to be no serious effort to unseat him. Farron called him an outstanding leader and the party has been stressing its success in forcing the coalition to raise the tax allowance, taking low-earners out of tax. \"Fairer tax in tough times\" is the conference theme.</p> <p><strong>\u2022&#xa0;Clegg's speech announced that Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is now in charge of the review into the replacement of Trident.</strong> Alexander has been sceptical about the need for and the cost of Trident before.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 David Laws, the education minister, has announced that \u00a3100m will be spent continuing a summer school programme for pupils from disadvantaged homes for another two years.</strong> The original scheme was announced by Nick Clegg last year. Laws made the announcement in his conference speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All too often pupils who have made big progress through the school year fall behind over the long summer holiday, particularly if they are changing schools. Over 2,000 secondary schools took part in that programme this summer and the feedback we received was fantastic, so I am announcing today that we are allocating a further \u00a3100 million to continue this project in 2013 and 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong>The Lib Dem conference passed a motion instructing MPs to vote against the proposed boundary changes because of the failure of the Conservatives to support Lords reform.</strong> Clegg said during the summer that the Lib Dems would not vote for the boundary changes that would help the Tories at the next election, but there has been speculation that he could be persuaded to change his mind. Blocking the boundary changes is now official party policy, and Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip, told the conference his MPs would not vote for them. The Lib Dems have also agreed that future Lib Dem peers will have to sign a declaration saying they support Lords reform before they can go to the Lords.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The iTunes <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDjRZ30SNo\">single</a> mocking Nick Clegg's apology over tuition fees has now made the top 40.</strong> \"To those of you who have seen the video,\" Clegg told the conference, \"I say this: I really am so, so sorry.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUDjRZ30SNo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KUDjRZ30SNo?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-22T19:45:48.109Z\">at 8.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-505e059458f90bd4c3fd4a0c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-22T18:39:08.965Z\">7.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>He ends by telling the Lib Dems to \"go out and show the country what we're made of\".

How about a personal apology from you Ed Balls for nearly bankrupting the country after you went on a prawn cocktail charm offensive in the City of London to let the banks off the hook?

Today the atmosphere is particularly buoyant - far from being crushed by the responsibilities of government, as their leader sometimes seems, the delegates seem excited to be in likeminded company and enjoying the sun and the sea air. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-505dec4358f90bd4c3fd4a05\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-22T16:59:39.212Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afternoon summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 Nick Clegg has arrived in Brighton for the opening of the Lib Dem conference saying the Lib Dems are going to \"hold [their] nerve\" and press on with their five-year programme.</strong> Clegg's personal ratings, and the party's as a whole, are very poor, but as the conference starts Clegg has been stressing his determination to fight the next election as Lib Dem leader and there seems to be no serious effort to unseat him. Tim Farron, one of his rivals, has called him an outstanding leader and the party has been stressing its success in forcing the coalition to raise the tax allowance, taking low-earners out of tax. \"Fairer tax in tough times\" is the conference theme.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 David Laws, the education minister, has announced that \u00a3100m will be spent continuing a summer school programme for pupils from disadvantaged homes for another two years.</strong> The original scheme was announced by Nick Clegg last year. Laws made the announcement in his conference speech.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All too often pupils who have made big progress through the school year fall behind over the long summer holiday, particularly if they are changing schools. Over 2,000 secondary schools took part in that programme this summer and the feedback we received was fantastic, so I am announcing today that we are allocating a further \u00a3100 million to continue this project in 2013 and 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 The Lib Dem conference has passed a motion instructing MPs to vote against the proposed boundary changes because of the failure of the Conservatives to support Lords reform.</strong> Nick Clegg said during the summer that the Lib Dems would not vote for the boundary changes that would help the Tories at the next election, but there has been speculation that he could be persuaded to change his mind. Blocking the boundary changes is now official party policy, and Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip, told the conference his MPs would not vote for them. The Lib Dems have also agreed that future Lib Dem peers will have to sign a declaration saying they support Lords reform before they can go to the Lords.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 The iTunes single mocking Nick Clegg's apology over tuition fees has now made the top 40.</strong></p> <p>That's it from me for tonight.</p> <p>But my colleague Paul Owen will carry on blogging.

He suggested that it had been better to open what he predicted would be a modern era of coalitions with a Tory-Lib Dem team-up rather than a coalition with Labour. The \"love-in\" between then-leader Paddy Ashdown and Tony Blair in the 1990s had threatened Lib Dem \"assimilation\", he said. With this coalition, by contrast, \"you would have to be absolutely crackers to think that the Lib Dems and the Tories are in some sort of love-in - this is a business relationship.\"</p> <p>His party, he said, now had to be \"distinctive, but not destructive\". This summer had seen \"the death of the Cameron project\", and the Tories were now going to go off to their \"extreme\" - \"we mustn't do the same with ours\". The Lib Dems must be \"radicals, absolutely - but not lunatics,\" he added prudently.</p> <p>He said the Lib Dems would look \"ludicrous\" if they withdrew early from the coalition. Browne suggested it was a \"complete delusion\" to suggest that if they left the coalition \"say, at the autumn 2014 conference\" the electorate would then forget the Liberals had been part of the government.</p> <p>Farron also tried to explain grassroots anger about the party breaking its pledge not to increase tuition fees, saying: \"We delivered, in their eyes, lots of nice stuff they didn't mind, but we didn't deliver what they really wanted.\" But he was less understanding about what he called the \"Polly Toynbee attitude\" towards the coalition, which he said was \"psychopathic\".</p> <p>Browne said that he had recently asked John Major how the coalition was going, and the former Tory PM who presided over nightmarish party splits over Europe had told him: \"Jeremy, it's far more stable than the coalition I led when I was prime minister.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/249499735377977345\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Tim Farron at the Lib Dem conference <a href=\"http://t.co/2PnsVShd\" title=\"http://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/249499735377977345/photo/1\">twitter.com/PaulTOwen/stat\u2026</a></p>&mdash; PaulTOwen (@PaulTOwen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulTOwen/status/249499735377977345\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-22T13:25:48+00:00\">September 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-505dbc7758f90bd4c3fd49fa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-22T13:27:53.243Z\">2.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Councillor David Tutt</strong>, leader of the Lib Dem group on East Sussex county council, opened the conference with a short speech.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. Everyone has their speciality, from Betty Turpin's Hotpot to Big Hefty's ability to drink a yard of ale in 12.42 seconds and not decorate nearby walls with special carrots. Twenty20 cricket is the specialty of most West Indies cricketers these days. In fact there is a pretty simple rule of thumb with West Indies: the smaller the game, the bigger their chances. They'd be <em>killer</em> at Noughtpointone0.1. And they are pretty handy at Twenty20, with a genuine chance of winning their first World Cup since Viv Richards, Collis King and Joel Garner savaged England at Lord's in 1979. </p> <p>They start their campaign against Australia today with a side that includes some of the biggest names in this form of the game: Chris Gayle, the Bradman of T20, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine. But you never really know with the West Indies. Their promises of a return to form have usually been about as reliable as Noel Gallagher's promises that his latest album is a return to form. It does feel different this time, mind, and it would be great for world cricket. What the world needs now isn't love, sweet love; it's not even the iPhone5; it's West Indies winning a World Cup playing swashbuckling cricket.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>West Indies have won the toss</strong> and will slog first. Chris Gayle has apparently been warming up in pantaloons.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The teams</strong></p> <p><strong>West Indies</strong> Gayle, Devon Smith, Charles, Samuels, Dwayne Bravo, Pollard, Sammy (c), Ramdin (wk), Narine, Rampaul, F Edwards.</p> <p><strong>Australia</strong> Watson, Warner, M Hussey, Bailey (c), White, Maxwell, Wade (wk), Christian, Hogg, Cummins, Starc.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Here comes Chris Gayle</strong>. He's no longer wearing pantaloons, but he does at least have a top on. And a bandana, which is protruding from the back of his helmet. He dances onto the field, skipping left and right. In the parlance on our time, he bloody loves it. Put your knitting away, Chris Gayle is batting!</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1st over: West Indies 8-0 (Dwayne Smith 2, Gayle 1)</strong> Chris Gayle theatrically offers no stroke to his first ball from Shane Watson. He usually likes to take a little bit of time to get his eye in. The second delivery to Gayle is an excellent short ball that smacks him on the helmet and flies away for four leg byes.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Australia 8-1 (Dwayne Smith b Starc 2)</strong> The left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc knocks Dwayne Smith over with a beauty. It was angled across the right-hander and then swung back sharply through the gate to peg back the off stump. A bona fide jaffa.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2nd over: West Indies 11-1 (Gayle 2, Charles 2)</strong> Johnson Charles is the new batsman.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3rd over: West Indies 11-1 (Gayle 2, Charles 2)</strong> Come on, <em>somebody</em> must be reading this. Pat Cummins has come on to replace Watson, and he starts with a brilliant maiden that includes two excellent yorkers and three consecutive play-and-misses from Johnson Charles.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4th over: West Indies 25-1 (Gayle 5, Charles 12)</strong> Chris Gayle's slow starts to his T20 innings are a crucial part of the theatre. Everyone knows it's coming; they just don't know when. He finally launches into his ninth delivery, from Starc, and is dropped by Shane Watson! Gayle sliced it miles in the air towards third man, where Watson shelled a tricky low chance as he fell forward. Johnson Charles slugs the next ball brutally over midwicket for six and drags four more to long leg.</p> <p>\"Are pantaloons still a thing?\" says Danielle Tolson. \"I know you have Jess Cartner-Morley for this stuff, but what's the definition? Also, who's most likely now to wear a cravat on the pitch, Douglas Jardine style?\" Surely it has to be Ravi Bopara after his recent handshaking exploits?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: West Indies 43-1 (Gayle 23, Charles 12)</strong> The beast has stirred. Gayle has just taken Pat Cummins' second over for 18! He screamed a full, wide delivery over point, pulled consecutive boundaries to midwicket, and picked the last ball up over square leg for a mighty six!</p> <p>\"I can see that The Guardian's reporting that KP made the valid point that the IPL and BBL made Luke Wright a better T20 cricketer,\" says SB Tang. \"Equally, we Australians should definitely thank Yorkshire \u2014 Starc's stint there this summer clearly made him a better limited-overs bowler. That ball to Smith was an absolute jaffa!\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 47-2 (Charles b Christian 16)</strong> Johnson Charles falls in strange circumstances. The ball from Christian followed Charles, hit him on the glove and then dribbled via his body back onto the stumps.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6th over: West Indies 53-2 (Gayle 27, Samuels 1)</strong> Gayle makes room to his first ball from Christian and <em>slaughters</em> a cut stroke through the covers for four. He's swinging like Leatherface, and it's spectacular entertainment. \"Is there a better sight in T20,\" says John Morgan than Chris Gayle in full flow?\" Is there heck. It's not just the sight, it's the consistency. His record is staggering.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7th over: West Indies 62-2 (Gayle 35, Samuels 2)</strong> When a man enters his forties, he doesn't need too much stress or excitement; he just wants the quiet life, right? Well. Brad Hogg, aged 41, is about to bowl to Chris Gayle. He might be having a midlife crisis in five minutes' time if Gayle goes after him. After a good start to the over from Hogg, Gayle drives a languid, almost effortless six over mid on. That was hilarious, just a gentle swing and the ball travelled 80 miles. Gayle made 5 from his first nine deliveries; since then he has 30 from 12.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8th over: West Indies 80-2 (Gayle 51, Samuels 3)</strong> The offspinner Glenn Maxwell's first ball is flighted onto off stump. Can you guess which part of the ground Gayle deposited it for six? It was long-on this time, again with a stunning, lazy swing of the bat. There's a big shout for LBW against Gayle later in the over. I think it was going down leg; more importantly so did Aleem Dar. Gayle punishes Maxwell for his impudence, heaving the next ball over midwicket for a 95-metre six! One ball left ... and how did that miss the stumps?! Gayle got the thinnest inside edge that took the ball <em>this</em> far past the leg stump and away for four. The boundary takes Gayle to a magnificent, utterly ludicrous half-century from only 26 balls. And he was five not out after nine balls.</p> <p>\"Re. the fourth over: surely that would require Ravi Bopara to be on a cricket pitch?\" says Dan Lucas. \"And no one really wants to see that any time soon, do they?\" Now now. I feel really sorry for Ravi. It's only two months since he seemed on the brink of his big breakthrough.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9th over: West Indies 88-2 (Gayle 52, Samuels 10)</strong> After the power (and, in fairness, timing) of Gayle, now we see the class of Samuels with a delicious square drive for four off Christian. West Indies have scored 77 off the last six overs.</p> <p>\"Lest this become dating advice,\" says Danielle Tolson, \"but Ravi Bopara's handshake showed what a gentleman he was (he'd be a safe escort home from the pub) and that picture of Chris Gayle is becoming more creepy and greasy as the game goes on.\" Hang on, are you saying modern women are happy to shake hands on the first date? What a bunch of harlots!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>10th over: West Indies 93-2 (Gayle 54, Samuels 12)</strong> An excellent, order-restoring over from Mitchell Starc costs just five, all singles. \"Readers of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/22/premier-league-clockwatch-live\">football clockwatch</a> might be forgiven for supposing I'd be all out of brain vomit by now, but a new Hollywood Anna Karenina, yeah?\" says Phil Podolsky. \"I mean, I honestly, non-hyperbolically prefer a visit to the dentist over film adaptations of books I happen to love, esp the Russian ones. But then Ruth Wilson's in it, and I'm not gonna pretend not to harbour a ghastly obsession ever since I've seen her in Luther. What's an obsession-prone gentleman to do?\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 93-3 (Gayle ct and b Watson 54)</strong> Shane Watson has got Chris Gayle! It's amazing how often Watson takes important wickets for Australia. This came with the first delivery of a new spell. It might just have stopped on the pitch, and Gayle got a leading edge as he tried to turn the ball to leg. It popped up on the off side and Watson ran to his right to take the catch. Gayle made a thrilling 54 from 33 balls, with five fours and four sixes.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>11th over: West Indies 97-3 (Samuels 14, Dwayne Bravo 2)</strong> \"Before the tournament, I thought WI were one of the favourites but the conditions(and not having played together much) might hamper them,\" says Sathish. \"But the conditions are the exact opposite of what you would expect in the sub-continent. Could be a rare case of a non sub-continental team winning in the sub-continent. Who do you think is going to win the thing?\" I have even less of a clue than usual. Predicting a T20 winner is an eejit's game.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>12th over: West Indies 99-3 (Samuels 15, Dwayne Bravo 3)</strong> \"Not reading here!\" shouts Matthew Wade when Hogg turns one back to hit Samuels in the thigh. The next one spins the other way, past Samuels attempted off-side slap. An excellent over from Hogg; two from it.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>13th over: West Indies 111-3 (Samuels 26, Dwayne Bravo 4)</strong> That's an awesome shot from Samuels, who makes room when there seemed to be none and times Christian to third man. He plays an even better stroke off the final delivery, driving a stunning six over extra cover. Twelve from the over.</p> <p>\"I'm here, watching and reading Down Under,\" says Sarah Whatman. \"Watching on Channel 9, which has recently shown a 70s-tastic miniseries called Howzat! Kerry Packer's War. Could provide inspiration for anyone taking part in Movember, though I doubt somehow that the Beeb will be buying the rights. Is the Women's World 20-20 happening at the same time? Who are the favourites?\" <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-womens-world-twenty20-2012/content/current/series/533235.html\">It sure is</a>. England hammered South Africa today and are the favourites, I think.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>14th over: West Indies 124-3 (Samuels 36, Dwayne Bravo 6)</strong> Samuels mistimes Hogg for six! He hasn't been picking Hogg and got a leading edge that kept travelling and <em>just</em> cleared the leaping Maxwell on the fence at long-off. A pull past short fine leg for four more makes it 13 from the over. West Indies are in a great position here.</p> <p>\"Samuels's inside-out cover drive for six was the shot of the tournament!\" says SB Tang. \"That's an insanely difficult shot to execute.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>15th over: West Indies 138-3 (Samuels 49, Dwayne Bravo 7)</strong> Watson's fourth ball is full and straight. Samuels attacks it with an axeman's backlift, swiping it high over mid on for another huge six. Remember when a six in international cricket was almost a JFK moment? Not anymore. Samuels makes it two in two balls with the sweetest of swivel pulls into the crowd at backward square leg. \"HOWZAT \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUwgZkiIFo4\">a timely link</a>,\" says Danielle Tolson. Oh my. The lead singer. Look at that look!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 140-4 (Samuels c Warner b Hogg 50)</strong> Samuels drives Hogg straight to long on to end a fine innings. He played at Gayle's pace: 50 from 32 balls, with three fours and four sixes.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>16th over: West Indies 145-4 (Dwayne Bravo 9, Pollard 4)</strong> Kieron Pollard, who is quite the unit, strides menacingly to the crease and drives his first ball disdainfully down the ground for a one-bounce four. Dear me, what a stroke to play first ball. Hogg ends with figures of 4-0-30-1.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>17th over: West Indies 158-4 (Dwayne Bravo 19, Pollard 6)</strong> What an extraordinary stroke this is from Dwayne Bravo. Cummins aimed a full, wide delivery on around a sixth-stump line, and Bravo launched his whole body towards it to drive it high over point for six! That shot oozed Caribbean flamboyance. Cummins bowls a front-foot no-ball later in the over, but concedes only a single from the free hit. Thirteen from the over. After a slow start, West Indies have scored 147 from the last 14. If Pollard goes mad they could still make 200.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 162-5 (Pollard c M Hussey b Watson 10)</strong> Mike Hussey takes a brilliant catch to get rid of the dangerous Pollard. He flicked a low full toss from Watson to deep midwicket, where Hussey sprinted in and dived forward to take a beautifully judged low catch.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>18th over: West Indies 165-5 (Dwayne Bravo 21, Sammy 1)</strong> Watson finishes with figures of 4-0-29-2.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 171-6 (Dwayne Bravo b Cummins 27)</strong> Bravo makes room to slap Cummins over extra cover, misses and is bowled middle stump. He made a useful 27 from 21 balls.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>19th over: West Indies 175-6 (Sammy 1, Ramdin 4)</strong> Pat Cummins, who started his spell with a maiden, ends with figures of 4-1-41-1. I can exclusively reveal that <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?ballsmax1=24;ballsmin1=24;ballsval1=balls;class=11;concededmax1=41;concededmin1=41;concededval1=conceded;filter=advanced;orderby=conceded;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings\">those figures are unique in the 135 years of international cricket</a>.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 187-7 (Sammy c Warner b Starc 12)</strong> Sammy smashed one straight six off Starc and falls aiming for a repeat, with Warner taking an immaculate catch running in from long-off. That went ridiculously high in the air, yet Warner never looked like dropping it. Two balls remaining.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>YEH DINESH TALK NAH! West Indies 187-8 (Ramdin b Starc 3)</strong> Ramdin makes too much room and is cleaned up by Starc, bowling around the wicket. Two wickets in two balls.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>20th over: West Indies 191-8 (Rampaul 0, Narine 4)</strong> Sunil Narine slaps his first ball, the last of the innings, over extra cover for four. That was a fantastic shot! And that's a fine effort from the West Indies, who are surely favourites to win this match after a riotously entertaining batting performance. Australia need <strong>192 </strong>to win. How they play Narine will probably decide the match. See you in a few minutes for their reply.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>1st over: Australia 8-0 (target 192; Warner 7, Watson 0)</strong> Australia surely have the best opening partnership in Twenty20, although Edwards almost ends the partnership first ball with a brilliant full-length inswinger that just misses Warner's off stump. He responds with a flashing extra-cover drive for four.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Australia 30-0 (target 192; Warner 28, Watson 0)</strong> Ravi Rampaul's first over has disappeared for 22! His first ball is short, wide and uppercut deliberately for six by Warner, who then drives sweetly to long-off for a one-bounce four. Rampaul follows that with the short ball, and Warner swivel-pulls it magnificently round the corner for six more! A front-foot no-ball means a free hit, which Warner inside edges to the fine leg boundary. Crikey.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Australia 30-1 (Warner c Ramdin b Edwards 28)</strong> David Warner is furious about this decision. He launched into a huge drive at Edwards, and the ball seemed to go past the outside edge before being taken by Ramdin. But Ramdin and Edwards were convinced it was out \u2013 and so was the umpire Asad Rauf. Warner walks off shaking his head having made an exhilarating 28 from 14 balls. That's a big wicket for the West indies.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Australia 38-1 (target 192; Watson 2, M Hussey 6)</strong> There was a noise as the ball passed Warner's bat, although you can't see any deviation. Warner clearly thought it wasn't out. It does seem a bit daft not to have any reviews in T20. I know it's a fast-moving game but you could surely have one per team. Anyway, Mike Hussey is in and he gets going by cutting a piece of rubbish from Edwards for four. Wild is the Windies bowling right now.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4th over: Australia 42-1 (target 192; Watson 4, M Hussey 8)</strong> This is a good move from Darren Sammy, who has brought on Sunil Narine to restore some order. He gave Australia all sorts of problems in the 50-over series earlier this year. Narine is such a threat that Australia might just sit on him and aim for figures of 4-0-20-1, something like that. That's what they do during the first over, which goes for four singles.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>5th over: Australia 50-1 (target 192; Watson 5, M Hussey 14)</strong> Mike Hussey mis-pulls Darren Sammy's first ball <em>just</em> short of mid-on. He gets hold of him later in the over, smashing a big six over wide mid-on. That brings up the fifty from only 4.4 overs; it's been a storming start from Australia.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6th over: Australia 62-1 (target 192; Watson 14, M Hussey 16)</strong> Watson pulls Narine fractionally short of Dwayne Smith, running in from deep midwicket. Then Narine bowls a front-foot no-ball, which means a free hit and the chance for Australia to attack him without fear. Watson does just that, slog-sweeping handsomely for six. That's been an outstanding Powerplay for Australia: 62 from six overs, and two of those were bowled by Narine. West Indies need a wicket.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>7th over: Australia 69-1 (target 192; Watson 17, M Hussey 21)</strong> This is the key partnership. Australia have some good players to come but none with the authority and ability of these two. I'm not sure I'd fancy that lower order against Narine with a required rate of 12 an over. Sammy gets one to burst from a length at Watson, who fences it short of backward point. Just three from the first five deliveries, but then Hussey walks over to the off side to flick a superb boundary behind square leg. He is a master in this form of the game.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>8th over: Australia 91-1 (target 192; Watson 38, M Hussey 22)</strong> Marlon Samuels replaces Sunil Narine and disappears for 22! A short ball is pulled savagely through midwicket for four by Watson, who then drives over long-off for the fifth six of the innings. Make that six sixes: Watson has been dropped for six by Dwayne Smith! He pulled Samuels straight to Smith at deep midwicket; it was at face height, a relatively straightforward chance, but Smith spilled it over his shoulder for six. Watson completes a stunning over with another pull through square leg for four.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>9th over: Australia 99-1 (target 192; Watson 40, M Hussey 28)</strong> Australia have scored at 11 an over for eight overs, and yet the required rate is still over eight. Is this cricket? The extent to which the game has changed since the turn of the century is mind-blowing. Mike Hussey pulls the new bowler Dwayne Bravo round the corner for another boundary in an eight-run over. Never mind a wicket; West Indies urgently need a dot ball.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>RAIN STOPS PLAY. 9.1 overs: Australia 100-1 (target 192; Watson 41, M Hussey 28)</strong> Crikey, where did that come from? All of a sudden it's blootering down in Colombo, and the groundsmen are urgently doing their thing. You won't be surprise to hear that Australia are ahead on Duckworth/Lewis \u2013 well ahead, in fact, by 19 runs.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5.44pm</strong> It's still raining. I'm talking to myself aren't I.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>5.47pm</strong> \"What are the odds of more play?\" says John Goldstein. \"I'm sure every Irish cricket fan is doing a rain dance at the moment as they still have a slim chance on Monday against the West Indies if this is finished for the day.\" </p> <p>I suspect it's unlikely, because it is <em>teeming</em> down in Colombo.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>5.52pm</strong> \"Here's something to keep you entertained whilst the rain buckets down, '<a href=\"http://astraightbat.wordpress.com/2012/05/24/shane-watson-a-care-bear-in-the-body-of-a-nordic-superhero/\">Shane Watson: A Care Bear in the Body of a Nordic Superhero</a>',\" says SB Tang. \"I still remember the days when Watto first came into the Australian limited-overs setup and couldn't hit over the top ... He's certainly changed that. Credit to him!\"</p> <p>Back in 2005, everyone in England found it oh so hilarious that Australia wanted to make Watson their Andrew Flintoff. I'd still take Freddie in Test cricket, but Watson will finish his career with better stats in all three forms of the game.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>It's a shame about rain, with Sara Torvalds</strong> \"T20 is too short a format to allow for rain. Stop it!\" Let me close my eyes and squeeze my face really hard, see if that works.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>5.55pm</strong> <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/axawr8\">Colombo, a few minutes ago</a>. It doesn't look good.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>6.05pm</strong> It's still hammering down. There's no chance of any more play.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6.11pm</strong> The umpires have officially called the game off, so Australia win by 17 runs and move into the last eight. The West Indies play Ireland on Monday to decide the other Super Eights place. Ta for your emails; night.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>6.14pm</strong> Hang on, apparently the game isn't officially off yet. Bah!</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>6.16pm</strong> Okay, it's definitely off now. Australia win, Shane Watson is the Man of the Match for the second game in a row, I'm going home. Night.</p>",
  "<p>In a chaotic and crumbling former public washhouse in a rundown district of northern Paris, Inna Shevchenko was explaining how a large leather punchbag hanging from the rafters might be used by the foot soldiers of a new generation of feminists.</p> <p>As she prepared to welcome recruits to the Ukrainian-based feminist group Femen's first \"international training camp\", it was clear that the instruction would not be all ideological. The talk was of \"war\", \"soldiers\", \"terrorism\" and \"enemies\". Was it not curious, one French journalist asked, that Inna and her warriors had adopted the language of combat, traditionally a male domain, to describe their mission?</p> <p>Was it not also inconsistent, another asked, that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/aug/02/topless-feminists-protest-olympic-london-video\" title=\"\">new feminists were using nakedness to rail against female exploitation</a>? In a week that had seen the banning of photographs of a topless Duchess of Cambridge, it was certainly topical.</p> <p>\"Ah, but we have a different idea; we are talking about peaceful war, peaceful terrorism,\" Inna said. \"We are taking off our clothes so people can see that we have no weapons except our bodies. It's a powerful way to fight in a man's world. We live with men's domination and this is the only way to provoke them, the only way to get attention.</p> <p>\"We don't hide our bodies, we don't hide our faces, we confront our enemies face to face. We look them in the eyes and we have to be well prepared physically for that.\"</p> <p>There was, she explained patiently, no contradiction in going topless or naked to protest against what they view as the three main evils of a global \"patriarchal society\": sexual exploitation, dictatorship and religion. Protesting naked, as Femen's slogans insist, is <em>libert\u00e9</em>, a reappropriation of their own bodies as opposed to pornography or snatched photographs which are exploitation.</p> <p>On a less intellectual level, taking their clothes off ensures a lot of publicity.</p> <p>\"There is an ideology behind protesting topless, but we quickly realised that if we took our tops off and screamed loudly it was a good way to get attention,\" Alexandra Shevchenko, one of Femen's founders, said. \"It works. Of course, people talk about our nakedness, but they are also listening to our message.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Believe me, it is really difficult for me to take my clothes off and stand in a public place. But this is the fight, and the fight is never easy.\"</p> <p>The Femen movement was created in Ukraine in 2008 to protest against sexism, prostitution and the exploitation of women in the former Soviet state. Inna, 22, second daughter of an army officer, and a journalism graduate, took off her top and joined the protests, a decision that would cost her a well-paid job as a press officer at Kiev town hall. In August, she fled Ukraine after a well-publicised stunt in which she wielded a chainsaw semi-naked to chop down a large wooden Orthodox cross in support of the jailed Russian feminists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot</a>: \"Afterwards I was followed for three days by the secret services. In fact they're not very secret, they like you to know they are following you to make you scared. One morning they tried to break into my apartment. I thought it was a sign I was in danger. I wasn't scared about being in prison. I have already been in prison many times, but there are worse things.\"</p> <p>An open invitation from a group of feminists in France brought her to Paris, where Femen has set up camp in the Lavoir Moderne Parisien, in Paris's poor and ethnically mixed Goutte d'Or district. In his 1877 novel L'Assommoir, Emile Zola described the Lavoir Moderne, then a state-of-the-art public washroom, as an \"immense hangar, with its flat ceiling, and open beams sitting on steel pillars closed off with large clear windows\".</p> <p>After closing in 1953, it began a second life as a community theatre, now under threat and in financial difficulty after a property developer acquired the building with a view to turning it into flats.</p> <p>On the first floor, high above where the old zinc washing vats would have steamed, a vast airy room is plastered with Femen campaign slogans: \"Nudity is freedom\", \"Let's get naked\", \"I am a woman, not an object\".</p> <p>If the male journalists and photographers who have beaten a path here since Femen announced its training camp are disappointed to find the girls fully dressed in the international uniform of jeans and T-shirts, they have the good grace not to show it.</p> <p>Outside, on the streets of Goutte d'Or, the three tall, beautiful women cut an incongruous path through the veiled and headscarf-wearing women of the large local Muslim community, weaving their pushchairs through the roadworks. Femen's \"Better naked than the burqa\" campaign has made few inroads here.</p> <p>\"The decision to bring the fight to France and open a training centre was a French initiative, an invitation from French feminists who sent us a message saying they needed us,\" said Inna.</p> <p>\"Before then we thought of France as a first world and already feminist country that didn't really need us. Since arriving, I have met many Frenchwomen and they say they need to start the fight again. We are bringing a new face, new blood, a new fight to feminism.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Classical feminism is like an old sick lady that doesn't work any more. It's stuck in the world of conferences and books. We have the same ideas as the classical feminists, what is different is the form of fight. We fight in a way that will attract young women to the ideology again.</p> <p>\"Early feminists fought for the right for women to wear trousers and jeans and won. Now we can wear trousers and jeans, but when a woman speaks in parliament, do the men listen? It's still a world dominated by men, where women are slaves and where women still do not earn the same or have the same opportunities. So we have to start again. It's the clothing fight all over again.\"</p> <p>To that end, Inna is staying in Paris to give her new feminist recruits their \"physical and ideological training\", while Femen militants Alexandra, 24, and Oxana Shachko, 25, are returning to Kiev, where a similar camp will be established. A third is planned for Brazil, where Femen has a large following, in the runup to the 2016 Olympic Games.</p> <p>\"Soldiers will be born here, but they will not be French soldiers. They will be feminist soldiers, international soldiers,\" said Inna. \"Women in every country need Femen.\"</p> <p>Back to the big leather punchbag hanging from the rafters, and Inna admits that the training sessions will not be entirely pacifist. \"Feminism should be provocative,\" she adds. \"There's no other way for women to get attention. It's the only action left to us. So the training will be moral but also physical. You have to be in good shape, because at protests you may need to run away or attack the police or jump on a building or a car.\"</p> <p>The French riot police in their \"robocop\" outfits have been warned.</p>",

  "<p>The furor over Todd Akin's \"legitimate rape\" comments had finally settled down when a Republican governor appeared at a Romney rally to praise Republican wives.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's not easy to be a spouse of an elected official. You know, they're at home, doing the laundry and doing so many things while we're up here on the stage getting a little bit of applause, right?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What is the matter with Republicans? With foot-in-mouth disease reaching epidemic levels, it's time to say it: the GOP has a woman problem. It goes much deeper than partisan differences over birth control coverage and abortion. These off-the-cuff comments about selfless spouses and virtuous virgins reveal that too many Republicans do not believe that women are equal to men.</p> <p>The GOP and Mitt Romney, of course, vigorously deny they are waging a \"war on women\". After all, just look at the women paraded across the Republican national convention stage, many of them elected in 2010 as Sarah Palin-branded \"Mama Grizzlies\". The problem, however, is that the GOP's XX politicians don't seem to be looking out for their less powerful sisters. The <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/05/22/488382/gop-women-caucus/?mobile=nc\">24 Republican women in the US House of Representatives cast</a> all of two votes for equal pay, two against domestic violence, and three to let women make their own birth control decisions.</p> <p>The GOP platform includes no exceptions for rape in its anti-abortion plank; Republican Governor Jan Brewer has already signed that policy into law. Only <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/05/22/488382/gop-women-caucus/\">seven Republican congressmen and women</a> voted for the landmark Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, even though women still earn on average 23% less than men. One hundred and forty-three US servicewomen have been killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, yet the Republican party platform opposes women in combat roles. Oh, and did you know that the vaunted Year of the Republican Woman left the GOP with fewer women in Congress than the Democrats had in 1992?</p> <p>Women have gotten the message. Since February, when Congress convened an all-male panel on birth control and Rush Limbaugh called Sandra Fluke \"a slut\", the polling has shown President Obama with a significant and consistent advantage with women voters nationally. The gender gap is particularly wide in swing states. Consider Virginia, which won international notoriety for a mandatory transvaginal ultrasound law, where Obama has opened up <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/to-claim-virginia-obamas-hopes-rest-on-women/2012/09/19/8413388a-026a-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_story.html?wprss=rss_politics\">a 19-point lead</a>. On the hotly-contested abortion issue, Obama holds a 13-point advantage over Romney, <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/19/section-3-views-of-the-candidates/\">according to a recent Pew Center survey</a>.</p> <p>Asked in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll who they thought would be \"better at dealing with issues of concern to women\", more than half said Obama and only a quarter said Romney. Women have also decoded the timeworn cultural assumptions behind the GOP's obsession with our ladyparts. \"What is this, the stone age?\" remarked one independent woman participating in a focus group. Or as a pin spotted at the Democratic National Convention put it: \"Sluts Vote.\"</p> <p>On the issues, the Republican party is out of step with American public opinion \u2013 even with men and many of its own members. Still, America's unexpected preoccupation with women's issues isn't merely about partisan competition or policy differences. It has taken on the character of an existential battle between two incompatible worldviews. </p> <p>The GOP's delirium over birth control and its magical thinking about rape this election season have shocked observers around the world. As remarkable has been the passion and breadth of women's backlash against the GOP's war on women. After all, many of the proposed bills that have in 2012 driven women to the streets and away from Romney-Ryan were enacted without fanfare or much notice in 2011. History's verdict, I suspect, will show that this movement was catalyzed into being less by the assault on reproductive rights and more by women's visceral rejection of the message sent by the Todd Akins, Rush Limbaughs, and Paul Ryans of the GOP: woman, get thee back in your proper place.</p> <p>Half a century on from a time when birth control was illegal and sex discrimination was the norm, many Americans might not have realized how far we've come. Thanks to 2012's preview of the Republican time machine, now we know. The GOP has chosen the wrong side on one of the fundamental global questions of the 21st century: women's equality. Still clinging to their old-timey views about helpful helpmeets and wanton wenches, the Republican party is in imminent danger of being permanently left behind.</p> <p>\u2022 Nancy L Cohen's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Delirium-The-Politics-Sex-America/dp/1619020688/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347573816&amp;sr=1-1\">Delirium: The Politics of Sex in America</a> is now out in paperback.

  "<p>When the Uruguayan president Jos\u00e9 Mujica was asked about his <a href=\"http://www.druglawreform.info/en/country-information/uruguay\">proposal</a> to make a historic break with global prohibition and put in place a legal, state-controlled market for cannabis, he replied: \"<a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/06/26/uruguay-wants-to-legalize-marijuana-sales-should-the-rest-of-the-world-follow/\" title=\"\">Someone has to be first</a>.\"</p> <p>In fact, recent years have seen reforms to cannabis policy and law proceeding apace around the world. The <a href=\"http://www.release.org.uk/downloads/publications/release-quiet-revolution-drug-decriminalisation-policies.pdf\">trend for decriminalisation</a> of possession for personal use (with civil or administrative penalties replacing criminal ones) has spread across much of Europe, Latin America, and beyond. Some countries have gone further, finding various ways around the strictures of international prohibition (under the three UN drug conventions) to have de-facto legal supply as well. The famous Netherlands cannabis \"coffee shops\" operate under a legal fudge in which their activities are technically illegal, but in practice are tolerated and licensed. The Spanish decriminalisation policy tolerates the personal possession of two plants and has allowed the creation of more than 300 <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/2011/07/01/cannabis-clubs-in-spain/\" title=\"\">cannabis co-operatives</a>. These pool the allowances of all their members, then farm and supply the resulting grass on a non-profit basis to these members from premises managed by the co-operative.</p> <p>Most surprising have been reforms in the US, the spiritual home of the \"war on drugs\" ethos and still its primary cheerleader internationally, despite more than <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/legalize-marijuana-56-percent-rasmussen-poll_n_1537706.html\">50% of Americans</a> now supporting cannabis legalisation. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_that_have_decriminalized_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States\">Fourteen US states have decriminalised cannabis possession</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States\">17 now allow medical cannabis</a> \u2013 in some cases with the distinction between medical and non-medical use becoming increasingly blurred. Most significant are the <a href=\"http://nationalcannabiscoalition.com/2012/07/comparing-marijuana-legalization-measures-in-oregon-colorado-and-washington-state/\">three state ballot initiatives</a>, in Washington, Oregon and Colorado being voted on in November, which will legalise and regulate cannabis markets for non-medical use.</p> <p>While the US initiatives are groundbreaking and, if <a href=\"http://blog.norml.org/2012/09/12/new-poll-washingtons-marijuana-legalization-initiative-i-502-holds-huge-lead/\">current polling</a> holds up, may well be the first real cracks in the edifice of global prohibition, they are, like most reforms, being led by (excuse the pun) grassroots campaigns. One of the unique aspects of the Uruguayan legalisation proposal is that it is government led. Indeed, the Mujica proposal for a state monopoly on cannabis production and supply has, ironically, run into conflict with another Uruguayan bill promoted by cannabis activists that seeks to decriminalise personal consumption of up to eight plants and establish co-operatives along the lines of the Spanish model.</p> <p>While unlikely to prove popular in the US, the idea of government monopoly is appealing in many ways, certainly for a pioneering initiative such as this. It is vitally important to learn from the mistakes made with alcohol and tobacco regulation. That means avoiding over-commercialisation and, while allowing legal availability to adult consumers, putting in place a regulatory framework to minimise health and social harms, rather than maximise profits. What this means in practice has been explored in some detail in Transform's <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm\">Blueprint for Regulation</a> which outlines potential controls over products (potency, price, information on packaging etc), vendors (licensing, vetting, training requirements), venues for sale and consumption (location, appearance, opening hours), and availability (age access controls, membership clubs). A responsible government is a far better entity to develop such a model than the free market.</p> <p>The regional context of the Mujica proposal is also critical. The debate on drug law reform in Latin America has accelerated, with multiple heads of state now <a href=\"http://transform-drugs.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/12-latin-american-leaders-call-for.html\">openly tabling the possibility of wider reforms including legalisation</a>, and the Organization of American States currently reviewing all the options, as frustrations have grown with the <a href=\"http://evolvecms.webfreelancersuk.co.uk/sites/default/files/Crime-briefing.pdf\">deteriorating security situation and violence</a> related to the drug trade. The perception is that Latin America carries an unacceptably heavy burden for drug consumption in the US and Europe, and that the externally imposed solution, a military and police-led war on drugs, is costly and counterproductive \u2013 as Mexico in particular has found out to its cost in recent years.</p> <p>The Mujica proposal is, perhaps unsurprisingly, couched within a bill of security measures and is being primarily promoted on that basis and, as is often the case with drug reform legislation, it includes provisions for increased penalties for traffickers. It also faces a number of other hurdles; it needs to be reconciled with the decriminalisation bill, and it does not enjoy majority public support (40% are in favour). Then are the objections from the guardians of the prohibitionist status quo, the US and the UN drug agencies.</p> <p>If or when the Uruguayan initiative will be realised remains impossible to say \u2013 they may be first, they may not. But it is now clear that someone will be, and soon. After decades of counterproductive failure, the era of blanket global prohibitions on drugs is finally coming to an end.</p>",

Planners seek to use evidence to try to identify and reflect or give voice to different interests. This can lead to a belief that local authority planners are not representative of the community, when in fact the issue is that they are may be representing the interests of those who are unable to participate or who have an alternative agenda.</p> <h2><strong>Fiona Mannion is communications Manager for the </strong><a href=\"http://www.tcpa.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>TCPA</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Democratic legitimacy is essential:</strong> Local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) may be the only show in town as far as strategic planning is concerned and in many places they will do positive things, but they cannot take responsibility for a whole raft of strategic elements as non-statutory, non-democratic bodies with varying skills and interests across the country. Government policy-makers of all colours have yet to answer the question of ensuring strategic planning bodies have proper accountability. Regional and strategic bodies are overhauled so often as to mean they very rarely get proper time to bed down.</p> <h2><strong>Jamie Veitch is the communications and external affairs manager for </strong><a href=\"http://towns.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Action for Market Towns</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>The problems for communities: </strong></p> <p>1. Some town and parish councils find it difficult to access neighbourhood funding that is held by the local planning authority. How can local councils ensure that money for neighbourhood planning is spent on the process if they are not in control of the funds?</p> <p>2. Many councils are concerned about the Dawlish public examination outcome, where the community plan failed to pass as a result of its failure to conform with the strategic priorities for the area \u2013 as these had not yet been agreed. Can a neighbourhood plan progress if the core strategy for the area is either absent or incomplete?</p> <p>3. What weight does an incomplete neighbourhood plan carry in terms of its impact on current planning decisions?</p> <p>4. What is the impact of a local planning authority amending the core strategy after it has been adopted, especially where this would have an impact on the neighbourhood plan?</p> <p>5. Is there a way a community can go ahead with a neighbourhood plan if the parish council is adamant that it does not wish to do one?</p> <p>6. Many local councils have expressed concern about the impact of the local planning authority choosing not to implement the community infrastructure Levy (Cil). What powers does a local council have to influence the decisions around implementing the Cil?</p> <p>7. There is some confusion around whether or not a sustainability appraisal must be carried out</p> <p><strong>Councils can help communities by:</strong></p> <p>1. Cross-departmental understanding of community led plans, including ensuring that elected members understand the plan, and setting a clear structure for funding and resourcing the plan; and, adopting community-led planning as a strategy for place-based community empowerment across departments</p> <p>2. Send officers or councillors to launch events and encourage the involvement of councillors in consultation activities. Offer a named contact who can respond to enquiries and signpost to colleagues where needed</p> <p>3. Make existing information available to communities to help them research their local area. Add value to the work of independent local facilitators, providing resources and support to aid community consultation. Help communities to analyse the data they have collected about their area.</p> <h2><strong>Alister Scott is professor of environmental and spatial planning at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.bcu.ac.uk/tee/bsbe\" title=\"\"><strong>Birmingham school of the built environment</strong></a><strong>, Birmingham City University</strong></h2> <p><strong>We need a change of heart on engagement:</strong> Both public and private sectors still adopt arrogant and patronising approaches to local communities. The prevailing view is still that professionals know best and that involving public in what we do is a necessary burden and extra cost, rather than an opportunity to make better policy. Changing this mindset is key, with significant front-end investment in communities at the earliest stage in policy as a first step.</p> <p><strong>Problems with planning so far:</strong> It is only six months or so since the national planning policy framework (NPPF) was published. The one year deadline has put huge pressure on limited planning departments to ensure plans meet NPPF criteria. The short timescale means that the kind of real consultation required has been cut \u2013 and good consultation takes time. The current government statements have created uncertainty over the status of greenbelt land and thrown further confusion into the picture. The lack of resources to deliver government promises and community expectations is not appreciated.</p> <p><strong>Don't treat towns and countryside separately:</strong> The focus seems always to be on towns, rather than the idea that we urgently need rural development too. In both cases, development is more than just building houses. The current polarisation between town and countryside in the NPPF debate is somewhat unhelpful in masking the needs of rural areas.</p> <h2><strong>David Marlow is managing director of </strong><a href=\"http://www.thirdlifeeconomics.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Third Life Economics</strong></a><strong> and a former local authority chief executive</strong></h2> <p><strong>Are we coming at this from the wrong angle?</strong> The issue is for communities to establish what are the priorities they collectively wish to achieve. Thereafter, there are a range of tools and interests that they might deploy to pursue those ends.</p> <p><strong>Neighbourhood plans are highly problematic: </strong>The Localism Act is largely untried and untested, the local plan needs to be largely in place to set the context, and the local authoity needs to be supportive of designating the neighbourhood area and community. And the community needs significant resources to develop the plan and proceed to adoption \u2013 both financial and technical \u2013 and these are often unlikely to be in place. Probably the community is better off, in the first instance, pursuing their ends through other means.</p> <h2><strong>Neil Blackshaw is a consultant at </strong><a href=\"http://www.eastonplanning.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Easton Planning</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Causing conflict: </strong>There is an inherent and rather fundamental conflict between the need to create 'room' for neighbourhood plans and the soundness requirements for local plans. Neighbourhood planning promised a lot including the power to decide where housing takes place, which is going to be an issue for many communities. If a planning authority has to define and allocate all of its housing sites to demonstrate its five year supply then the neighbourhood plan is going to be frustrated. There have already been examples of 'conflict' between the two and it wont take much to alienate local communities.</p> <p><strong>Neighbourhood plans enable 'place-specific' policies:</strong> With the best will in the world, these will not be adequately addressed in the local plan. You could look on them as area action plans under the previous regime but with the added ingredient of intensive involvement. This goes to the nub of it. If the neighbourhood plan is seen as duplicating the local plan then it does all become a massive burden.</p> <p><strong>Healthy communities: </strong>Health provides a far more meaningful aim for local communities than sustainable development. The NPPF has some very useful words that ought to drive greater collaboration between health and planning strategies. There is an urgent need to make sure the transition process in health, clinical commissioning groups and moving public health to upper tier and all that surrounds it, actually engenders collaboration with spatial planning.</p> <h2><strong>James Derounian is a principal lecturer in community development and local governance at the </strong><a href=\"http://www.glos.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>University of Gloucestershire</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>Communities need support to make planning work:</strong> The danger is it will reinforce inequalities; that communities with lots of assets and social capital will give it a go while \"poorer\" communities fall further behind.</p> <p><strong>Are local enterprise partnerships effective?</strong> Or are they as effective as regional development agencies?
