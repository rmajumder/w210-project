  "<p>Mark Hughes expects to complete one of the most surprising transfers of the summer as Queens Park Rangers close in on the signing of Brazil goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar.</p> <p>The 32-year-old passed a medical examination and agreed personal terms on a four-year contract at Loftus Road as QPR's comfortable victory over Walsall was overshadowed by news of the imminent signing of a player who won the Champions League with Internazionale two years ago.</p> <p>\"It's not a done deal yet, there are still some papers to go to and fro but we'll be delighted if it goes through,\" said Hughes, who foresees no complication with the formalities. C\u00e9sar will earn a net annual salary of \u00a32m and his arrival will constitute QPR's most forceful statement of intent in a summer in which they have already signed eight players and let 13 perceived lesser ones go.</p> <p>The goalkeeper, who has won 64 caps for his country, was a crucial component of the Inter team that became European champions and attracted many suitors this summer despite Inter demoting him to a back-up following their purchase of Slovenia's Samir Handanovic from Udinese. Hughes said that \"the opportunity to sign him only arose in the last couple of days and when you get a chance to sign a player of that quality, you have to pursue it to its conclusion\".</p> <p>That spells bad news for another of QPR's recent signings, Rob Green, who committed a costly error during his debut against Swansea City 11 days ago and now must fear a long stint on the bench looms. \"I will sit down with Rob and talk him through it,\" said Hughes. \"What we're trying to do here is improve the quality of the group and pose challenges to everyone.\"</p> <p>C\u00e9sar is unlikely to be QPR's last recruit before the transfer window shuts as Hughes presses on with his radical revamp of a squad that avoided relegation on the last day of last season. He declared that a centre-back remains his top target.</p> <p>\"That was the plan at the start of the window and is the one area that we haven't been able to address but we'll keep looking at options right up until the window closes,\" said the manager, whose first choice is Tottenham's Michael Dawson. Hughes also indicated that Joey Barton proposed move to Marseille may yet go through after an initial setback. \"It may not be dead in the water,\" said Hughes. \"This option has attracted Joey's enthusiasm so hopefully something can be done.\"</p> <p>Amid all the haggling at Loftus Road, Hughes will be glad his team disposed of Walsall with little fuss.</p> <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips opened the scoring in the 29th minute, poking the ball into the net from six yards after a fine pass from Bobby Zamora. Early in the second half Green gave a reminder of why C\u00e9sar is likely to replace him, as the former England No1 fumbled a long range shot by Jamie Paterson early in the second half and Will Grigg headed against the crossbar from the resultant corner. Rangers secured their victory in the 66th minute when Zamora received a deft pass from Kieron Dyer and sent a chip over David Grof and into the net.</p> <p>On a night in which Alejandro Faurlin made a strong return after missing eight months through injury, Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, crowned his home debut by adding a third goal in the 84th minute.</p>",
  "<p>Spain's attempts to stave off a full bailout were dealt a blow on Tuesday when the regional government of Catalonia said it needed \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.97bn) from a central government rescue fund.</p> <p>It came as figures showed Spanish banks saw \u20ac1 withdrawn for every \u20ac20 deposited in July \u2013 making it the worst month for deposit flight in 15 years \u2013 and Spain's statistics institute revealed the recession was worse than thought, with the economy shrinking at an annual rate of 1.3% in the second quarter.</p> <p>Catalonia is one of half a dozen regional governments shut out of markets and needing government help to roll over debt and fund budget deficits. Regions have a combined debt of \u20ac145bn, with \u20ac36bn needing to be refinanced this year.</p> <p>Prime minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government may eventually take direct control of the region's finances. But regional prime minister Artur Mas, of the Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, has threatened a snap election if that happens. His spokesman, Francesc Homs, rejected any \"political terms\" for borrowing the money.</p> <p>A report by the Fedea thinktank predicts Catalonia, which accounts for one fifth of the economy, will miss the 1.5% deficit target set this year, with an expected 2.5% deficit making it the second-worst performing region. Revised figures showed the Spanish recession started three months earlier than previously indicated. \"The data shows the recession started in the third quarter of last year,\" secretary of state for the economy, Fernando Jim\u00e9nez, admitted.</p> <p>\"The downturn in the Spanish economy is deeper than previously thought and accelerating,\" warned Robert O'Daly of the Economist Intelligence Unit.</p> <p>Unemployment is already at 25% but the speed at which jobs are disappearing quickened to an average rate of 800,000 jobs a year in the second quarter, according to the statistics institute.</p> <p>European council president Herman Van Rompuy said on Tuesday it was up to Spain to decide whether to seek eurozone help, after meeting Rajoy in Madrid. Rajoy repeated that he needed more details from the European Central Bank to help him decide.</p> <p>Sources at the Bank of Spain claimed the sudden drop in deposits was mostly due to banks withdrawing money placed with other entities, but the fall came amid growing consumer anger with retail banks. Tens of thousands of small savers are set to be hit with losses on preference shares they bought in former savings banks that now need bailing out by the eurozone's rescue fund.</p> <p>Spanish banks can take up to \u20ac100bn (\u00a379.7bn) from the fund, but preference shareholders must first bear losses of up to 80%. Many savers who bought the shares thought they were risk-free deposits from high street banks.</p> <p>Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, abruptly withdrew from delivering a speech in the US next weekend, citing pressure of work as he prepares two important moves on the euro crisis.</p> <p>Draghi was due to speak at the annual economic policymaking elite gathering at Jackson Hole in Wyoming on Saturday before an audience of global central bankers. But he is preparing to unveil controversial moves next week aimed at pushing down the costs of borrowing for Spain and Italy by launching ECB bond-buying interventions in the financial markets, a policy bitterly criticised by Germany's powerful Bundesbank.</p> <p>Draghi is also engaged in behind-the-scenes politicking over the shape and powers of a new eurozone bank supervision authority. A few days after Draghi announces the bond-buying policy, following an ECB governing council meeting next week, the European commission is to deliver proposals for the new eurozone bank regulator, calling for the ECB to be given extensive new powers as the key supervisory authority.</p> <p>J\u00f6rg Asmussen, the German member of the ECB's six-strong executive who has co-drafted the bond-buying scheme for Draghi, disclosed on Monday some of the conditions required to trigger ECB action.</p> <p>The ECB will intervene in the secondary markets to buy bonds with short maturities, he said, but only if the eurozone's bailout funds first became active in the primary markets \u2013 in other words directly buying up distressed government bonds.</p> <p>That introduces a strong element of politics and likely delays since eurozone governments and finance ministers will need to decide to use the bailout funds before ECB action is triggered.</p> <p>Any country benefiting from the bond-buying would need to request a bailout and succumb to eurozone terms, situations that Rajoy and his Italian counterpart, Mario Monti, are anxious to avoid.</p> <p>Asmussen also made clear the ECB was keen to be granted the new banking supervisory powers, but warned the commission in Brussels it would only take on the role on its terms.</p> <p>\"The ECB is ready to accept this responsibility, but under certain conditions,\" he said. \"The ECB has to be given all the instruments needed to carry out the tasks of bank supervision effectively. In particular, that means access to all the necessary information, intervention rights and the right to close down non-viable banks.</p> <p>\"Without these minimum tools, the ECB will not take on the responsibility. The risk to the reputation of the institution would be too &#xa0;great.\"</p>",
  "<p>Food culture in Britain has happily changed for the better since the early 90s, when a hungry vegetarian friend of mine was first proffered baked halibut and then lumped with a bowl of boiled cauliflower to wash down with tea. Even chophouses now offer an ungrudging vegetarian option, while no supermarket carries fewer than four varieties of hummus. I became a confirmed vegetarian in my 20s, not because I am Indian, as is often assumed \u2013 most Indians are not vegetarians \u2013 but because I once dated an American who was one. More ingloriously, perhaps, I'm squeamish about hurting fluffy little chicks and cute calves with large pleading eyes. I'm not, however, an evangelical vegetarian, not least because my inability to embrace full veganism, compounded by a passion for cafe au lait and banoffee pie, somewhat disqualifies me from preaching to others about eating animal products.</p> <p>Moreover, vegetarianism can be as loaded with prejudice and nastily coercive as any other ideology. Growing up in India, I developed a keen awareness of how dietary taboos around meat could be speciously used to assert caste or religious superiority, often violently.</p> <p>Last April <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-17727379\" title=\"\">Hindu extremists attempted to prohibit the serving of beef in university dining halls</a> as a way of further stigmatising marginalised Dalit students whose food culture includes beef. Even though the historical record suggests that beef was once eaten by upper-caste Hindus, food fascism of this sort, including the shibboleth of \"cow protection\", has also&#xa0;been used as a deadly political weapon against minority Muslim communities. In fact Indians, including some Hindus, <a href=\"http://mofpi.nic.in/ContentPage.aspx?CategoryId=173\" title=\"\">consume 1.14m tonnes of buffalo meat</a> a year, with India set to lead beef exports in 2012.</p> <p>But the claims of vegetarians and vegans to the most environmentally responsible diets now appear to be validated by a report from leading scientists warning that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/26/food-shortages-world-vegetarianism\" title=\"\">catastrophic food shortages can only be avoided if the world switches to a mainly vegetarian diet</a> in the next 40 years. With many regions like the Sahel in Africa already facing near-famine conditions, 2 billion people already malnourished, and an estimated 2 billion increase in the world population by 2050, a global plant-based diet seems not just desirable but inevitable. The Stockholm International Water Institute's report notes that one third of the world's arable land produces grain to feed livestock rather than people. A vegetarian diet commandeers five to 10 times less water than a carnivorous diet, though dairy consumption still contributes to the problem.</p> <p>While there are strong environmental and health reasons to reduce our dependence on animal farming and for the better-off to drastically cut meat and dairy consumption, we must resist the temptation to abstractly denote a universal vegetarian lifestyle as the sole or simple answer. At stake are also tenacious problems of overconsumption and the inequitable commandeering of global resources, neither of which will be solved merely by passing the braised tofu.</p> <p>In the name of \"growth\", that capitalist holy cow, a smaller number of people consume far more than their share of essential resources. Wealth concentration generates disparate purchasing power that allows richer nations as well as the better-off in every nation to consume \u2013 and waste \u2013 a disproportionate share of food, fuel, water and other resources. Arable land itself is put towards profit through speculation, mining and logging, rather than feeding people. The predictable argument that overpopulation is the main problem remains a red herring. When one person can consume or waste between two and five people's share at a time when per-capita food production has increased, inequity, not human numbers, and the richer, not the poorer, are still the problem.</p> <p>Overconsumption and the corporatisation of food supply chains also underwrite the factory farming responsible for unconscionable levels of animal suffering and the depletion of marine ecosystems. When they can afford to do so at all, the poor have eaten meat sustainably and relatively humanely through small numbers of livestock or by fishing in limited quantities. The irony of vegetarianism or veganism as a lifestyle choice in wealthier countries is that it correlates with the relative affluence of being able to choose to spend your food budget on good-quality fruits, vegetables and grains. The less affluent remain condemned to buying whatever is cheapest, whether stale vegetables, processed foods or factory-farmed chicken.</p> <p>A serious discussion about food security and natural resource usage must emphasise redistributive social justice and not just lifestyle choices in the abstract. The excessive consumption of animal products clearly poses an imminent danger to both planet and human existence. But addressing this cannot take the form of a coercive herbivorous moralism. We need a comprehensive reordering of the global economy and our priorities as human beings to end the limitless scandal that is widespread hunger.</p>",

  "<p>Cracks have appeared in the new French government after a Socialist minister made a gaffe about the future of nuclear power and tensions mounted over the thorny issue of parliamentary ratification of the European budget treaty.</p> <p>The Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, have seen their popularity ratings fall over the summer as the French economic crisis deepens. Already struggling with a difficult return to work after the holiday season, the government has now been shaken by the row over nuclear energy.</p> <p>The Green party, which has two ministers in the Socialist-led government, was taken aback after the minister for industrial recovery, Arnaud Montebourg, described nuclear power as an \"industry of the future\", seeming to cast doubt on a commitment to shut power stations and reduce France's devotion to atomic energy. France is the most nuclear-dependent country in the world, with 75% of its energy coming from nuclear. In a deal with the Greens before this year's parliamentary and presidential elections, Socialists promised to reduce the share of nuclear in French electricity production to 50% by 2025, shutting 24 nuclear reactors. But so far, only one of France's 59 nuclear reactors, at Fessenheim in eastern France, is due to be decommissioned.</p> <p>Montebourg called nuclear energy a \"tremendous asset\" with a key future role, saying: \"We need energy that is not too expensive.\" He was backed by the interior minister, Manuel Valls, who said nuclear was undeniably a part of the future of French industry.</p> <p>The Green MP No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re condemned the comments as a provocation. Another Green MP, Denis Baupin, said the government was \"divorced from reality\". The prime minister tried to play down the row, and Montebourg's views were presented as personal opinions. But the timing was unfortunate, two weeks before the government's big environmental conference, designed to convince a sceptical environmental lobby that Hollande is serious about green issues.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Socialists are trying to contain internal divisions over the ratification of the new European budget treaty. Relieved that the French constitution will not need to be modified to accommodate the treaty, the government must still submit the text to a parliament vote in October.</p> <p>But some in the Greens and on the left wing of the Socialist party have misgivings about losing sovereignty to Brussels and imposing austerity rules which they say would be socially and economically damaging to France.</p> <p>Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon's leftist Front de Gauche and Eva Joly, the former Green presidential candidate, have called for a referendum. The debate around the treaty ratification is already reopening political wounds from the sparring about the 1992 Maastricht treaty and France's 2005 no vote against the EU constitution.</p> <p>The prime minister has taken a hard line, telling Socialist MPs they should fall in line with the government amid \"risk of a European crisis\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, in its first key move after the summer break, the government on Tuesday temporarily cut the price of petrol and diesel by up to six cents a litre to help French households. The cost will be shared between oil companies and the state, which will lose \u20ac300m in tax revenues. The move stopped short of Hollande's campaign promise of a freeze on fuel prices, which had been seen as too complicated and a legal minefield.</p>",
  "<p>Venice's Giardini public park is filled with the sound of popping prosecco corks, snapping cameras and multilingual chatter, but as the global architectural community flocks to the city for the start of the 13th Architecture Biennale, there's a mood of reassessment in the air.</p> <p>For the past two decades, the sector has been dominated by big names and spectacular projects, but there's a sense in Venice that there is a need to re-engage with users of architecture.</p> <p>This reflective tone has largely been set by this year's director, British architect Sir David Chipperfield. Internationally renowned, awarded and admired, Chipperfield is very close to the top of the architectural game, but his chosen theme for the event is Common Ground \u2013 a title that suggests inclusivity and anti-elitism.</p> <p>\"Architecture has become a sort of exotic fruit,\" says Chipperfield. \"It just sort of happens in certain places where it gets watered.</p> <p>\"The more it becomes a special thing, the less chance we have to deal with it on a day-to-day basis. What architecture is and how it fits into the community is a story I want to tell in this.\"</p> <p>To fill the Biennale's main exhibition spaces \u2013 the vast Arsenale, a series of former naval buildings, and the central pavilion of the nearby Giardini \u2013 Chipperfield has invited 103 architects, artists, photographers and academics to contribute.</p> <p>There are still big names aplenty: Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Alvaro Siza, Peter Zumthor, not to mention 40 British architects. But Chipperfield forbade his contributors from simply presenting models of their latest work in the hope of drumming up some trade. \"It's about architecture, not architects,\" he says.</p> <p>In the 55 national pavilions \u2013 the other component of the Biennale \u2013 the same spirit of questioning is reflected, nowhere more so than at the British Pavilion, curated by the British Council.</p> <p>Its exhibition, Venice Takeaway, is subtitled Ideas to Change British Architecture, and displays the findings of 10 architects who travelled to other countries to research approaches relevant to the UK.</p> <p>One team presents a 1980s programme of building prefabricated schools in Brazil initiated by legendary architect Oscar Niemeyer, for example. Another looked at how Argentinian architects developed new ways of self-funding construction projects following the country's economic crisis. Another mischievously compares the planning policies of the Communist party of China with those of the coalition government.</p> <p>\"There's a feeling that British architecture is up for grabs at the moment,\" says the exhibition's co-curator, Vicky Richardson.</p> <p>\"Our economic situation means that a whole generation of British architects is having difficulty finding work. But there's also the coalition government's new guidelines on planning, which nobody knows quite how they're going to pan out, and the abolition of Cabe [the advisory panel on architectural design, set up by New Labour, which has now been folded into the Design Council].</p> <p>\"In a sense this is a reversal of the conventional idea of the national pavilion; instead of presenting British architecture, we've tried to show the openness of British architecture to outside ideas.\"</p> <p>As well as redefining architecture, the Biennale could represent another redefinition of the national identity.</p> <p>Like the London 2012 Olympics and its accompanying Cultural Olympiad (which was also overseen by the British Council), Britain's place in this year's Biennale seems to be less about competing with other countries than about making connections with them, listening and learning from them and forging a global cultural profile that is not simply post-imperial, but post-national. Not that self-interest can be completely discounted from this inclusive strategy.</p> <p>Whether the Biennale will make an impact on British architecture or architecture is another question, especially when it comes to commitments to global problems and the world's less privileged \u2013 which, from the perspective of Venice, is just about everyone.</p> <p>Beneath the theme of Common Ground lies the irony that the Biennale takes place in one of the world's most expensive cities, and that the occasion is marked by innumerable parties, dinners and exclusive events. Ideas are exchanged as the prosecco flows.</p> <p>The event has become more inclusive \u2013 new national exhibitors this year include Kosovo, Angola, Kuwait, Turkey and Peru \u2013 and 2010's Architecture Biennale attracted 170,000 visitors over three months, but tangible results are always harder to gauge.</p> <p>Chipperfield doesn't overstate the Biennale's power, but he believes it is important for architects to gather somewhere and he is striving to get them to engage with the world \"outside the walls of this church\".</p> <p>\"If we can deal with the common ground between the profession,\" he says, \"maybe we can deal better with common ground between all professions.\"</p>",
  "<p>Big-willy politics is back. If we do not build a third runway at Heathrow, says Tory MP Tim Yeo, Britain will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/28/david-cameron-taunted-tory-mp-heathrow\" title=\"\">\"slide towards insignificance\"</a>. Britain will leave the premier league, lose out to China and become a second-rate power. Those who refuse to build third runways are mice not men. As for manifesto pledges and coalition agreements, they are for wimps. Real men love planes. To be great, says Hamlet, is <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DZkNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cgreatly+to+find+quarrel+in+a+straw+when+honour%E2%80%99s+at+the+stake%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qmRPY_x3j2&amp;sig=LjkQUTyYy_yoTYBQgQclQzHjT1o&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cgreatly%20to%20find%20quarrel%20in%20a%20straw%20when%20honour%E2%80%99s%20at%20the%20stake%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">\"greatly to find quarrel in a straw when honour's at the stake\"</a>. What greater honour could there be than a third runway at Heathrow?</p> <p>Similar dire warnings were made if Britain withdrew from \"east of Suez\", refused to join the euro or failed to back a British car industry. They are why governments still build aircraft carriers, buy nuclear missiles and fight foreign wars. They are why lobbyists argue for banking bonuses, high-speed trains and lofty skyscrapers. Yeo says we risk repeating Macmillan's retreat from empire. Foreigners will kick sand in our faces and be rude about our food and our women.</p> <p>Big-willy politics is the most dangerous politics of all. It appeals to paranoid machismo, not argument or reason. Yeo's taunt at David Cameron \u2013 is he \"a man or a mouse\" over Heathrow \u2013 is the dumbed-down remark of a politician who takes \u00a3140,000 in a year from energy companies while chairing the Commons energy select committee \u2013 though this may say more about today's parliament than about Yeo. The thesis that any profit to an interest group must be \"good for Britain\" is insidious. War is more profitable than peace, but we do not go to war with Russia.</p> <p>The case for a third runway at Heathrow is like that for a heliport in St James's Park or a shard on Hampstead Heath. Some might find it remunerative and convenient, but we try not to commit such outrages on the environment these days. No sensible country builds airports with flight paths over densely populated areas. However much BAA and BA may spend on PR to keep alive \"the case for a third runway\", it cannot alter this fact.</p> <p>The London area has more airports and more runways than any other city in Europe. Heathrow alone serves more \"key business\" destinations than Paris and Frankfurt together. Screaming for a \"hub\" is lobbyists' nonsense. London's trading future lies in being a terminus, not a transit lounge. Anyway, a mere 15% of London air travel is business rather than pleasure, the latter overwhelmingly that of outbound Britons. Why boosting Britain's \u00a315bn tourism deficit holds the key to economic recovery is a mystery.</p> <p>There is nothing to stop Heathrow serving more business destinations if BAA and BA wanted. Instead they are addicted to outbound leisure travel, as is glaringly obvious from any Heathrow departure board. As for inbound tourists, far more harm is done by Cameron's clampdown on their visas than might be done by directing them to Stansted or Gatwick.</p> <p>BA prefers to work out of Heathrow, while Spanish-owned BAA has sold both Gatwick and Stansted and has no interest in their growth, let alone in a new Thames airport. These are two companies with a commercial interest in Heathrow, pure and simple. They are continuing to press for a third runway for one reason alone. Cameron and George Osborne have shown they will bend under pressure. While this is sometimes the welcome reversal of a bad decision, each U-turn is a gift to the lobbyists.</p> <p>Cameron famously said in opposition that \"secret corporate lobbying, like the expenses scandal, goes to the heart of why people are so fed up with politics\". Money, he said, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/mar/25/cash-for-policy-deep-offence\" title=\"\">\"buying power, power fishing for money, and a cosy club&#xa0;at the top making decisions in their&#xa0;own interest\"</a>. He spoke the truth. Can he now not recognise the evil&#xa0;when&#xa0;he sees it?</p> <p>This week's Guardian poll shows the pressure on the government to show lateral thinking on the economy. The demand takes a drearily familiar form, that Cameron sack Osborne rather than change his recovery policy. With the American and German economies now showing signs of growth, the danger of Britain \"sliding back to insignificance\" is real. But the pressure from Yeo and others is to halt this slide, not through a&#xa0;desperately needed stimulus to liquidity and demand, but through \"infrastructure projects\".</p> <p>Not a day passes without a call for something big, brash and financially sexy: a road, an airport, a railway, a power station. Economists get on TV if they call for more infrastructure, even when such projects take years to get off the ground and benefit only professionals and consultants in the short term.</p> <p>The British class system is nowhere more apparent than in this pressure. An economic stimulus that puts money directly into the pockets of consumers through higher benefits and/or lower taxes is bad, indeed possibly immoral as&#xa0;corrupting expectations. It is thought vulgar to print money for people to spend through their wallets and credit cards. On the other hand, a stimulus that aids \"investment\" is automatically good. As we saw last month, Olympic stadiums are good, school playing fields&#xa0;are bad. Third runways are good, local transport bad. Developers want hypermarkets and eco-cities in the countryside, not healthier high streets&#xa0;and urban renewal.</p> <p>The Treasury and the Bank of England seek to \"pump money into investment\", even when they know it merely disappears into a bank vault. Money can be printed but not for ordinary people to spend. It must be conduited through government agencies, banks, boards and consultants. It thus becomes \"clean\" and can even be declared \"below-the-line and off-budget\". Nobody trusts ordinary people to rescue the British economy. The only good spending is government spending on infrastructure. It makes no sense.</p> <p>The best thing Cameron could now do is meet Yeo's challenge. He should show himself a man, not a mouse. He should get Yeo expelled from the Commons energy committee for blatant conflict of interest. He should declare closure on the third runway nonsense. He should tell the toffs and tycoons of the infrastructure lobby that consumption, not investment, is today's absolute priority. A recession is no excuse for collapsing environmental standards or pushing through dumb projects.</p> <p>Cameron might take note that the chief lobbyist for BAA is a firm called Blue Rubicon. He now faces his blue Rubicon. Dare he cross it, and send the&#xa0;mice scampering?</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners highlighting environmental and human rights breaches by mining group Vedanta Resources have been intimidated by police forces and subjected to trumped up charges, it was claimed on Tuesday.</p> <p>The allegations were made by the human rights campaigners Amnesty International at the FTSE 100 group's annual meeting, which was notable for requiring its own police presence as well as for the dissenting voices from City fund managers in addition to the protest groups. An <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20300\" title=\"\">Amnesty report claimed</a>: \"An ongoing inquiry by India's Human Rights Commission [has found] that the police in both the framing of false charges and the suppression of dissent have acted to promote the interests of the company\".</p> <p>Amnesty's Peter Frankental asked the meeting: \"Do you take these findings and allegations seriously and what are you going to do about them?\" After a testy exchange, Vedanta non-executive director Naresh Chandra said: \"Give us the information and we will have it investigated\".</p> <p>Shareholders supportive of the management frequently clashed with critics of the company's record on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/24/vedanta-mining-industry-india\" title=\"\">human rights</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/14/vendata-loses-safety-awards\" title=\"\">safety</a> and the environment.</p> <p>Standard Life Investments, which holds 9m Vedanta shares, said it would abstain on the re-election of members of the nominations committee because the board contained too few independent directors. Aviva said it was \"pleased to note considerable progress ... [while] concerns over the company's environmental and social record remain\". Aviva added that those concerns had depressed the share price of Vedanta, which mines predominantly in India, Zambia and Australia.</p> <p>Among the other campaign groups attacking the company was Survival International which continued to highlight <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/films/lodu-message\" title=\"\">Vedanta's efforts to mine bauxite in India's Niyamgiri hill</a>, which an indigenous tribe considers to be sacred.</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another George Galloway rumpus. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1NIuCt72bU\" title=\"\">cat impersonator</a>-cum-MP has signed up to present a fortnightly show for al-Mayadeen, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Mayadeen\" title=\"\">a new Arab television channel</a> said to be linked to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. It comes a week after he belittled alleged victims of rape, and a day after he used terms offensive to disabled people.</p> <p>Beirut-based al-Mayadeen means \"the public squares\" in Arabic. Critics claim it is either funded by Iran, or by Assad's cousin \u2013 though its management denies both charges, and has at least occasionally given a platform to members of the Syrian opposition. But certainly, its head of news is <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20120612-al-mayadeen-new-anti-al-jazeera-channel-media-lebanon-syria\" title=\"\">married to Assad's sometime PR adviser</a>, while the station's director quit a rival channel (Qatar-backed al-Jazeera) because he felt it was too critical of the Syrian government.</p> <p>\"Given that they're in such a dire situation, it's unlikely that the Syrian regime has put money into the station,\" explains <a href=\"http://www.qatar.northwestern.edu/about/our-people/faculty/joe-khalil.html\" title=\"\">professor Joe Khalil</a>, an expert in Arab TV at the Qatar branch of Northwestern university, \"but they're definitely getting [the station's] support. Al-Mayadeen does not shy away from saying that they stand with anyone who is against Israel.\"</p> <p>This isn't the first time Galloway has taken a controversial shilling (he also has a show with the Iran-backed Press TV), and nor is he alone among British politicos. Ken Livingstone had a regular slot with Press TV, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2011/jan/19/ken-livingstone-andrew-gilligan-presstv\" title=\"\">as did \u2013 amusingly \u2013 his arch-critic Andrew Gilligan</a>; his putative rival for the mayoralty, Nick Ferrari; and disgraced Tory MP Derek Conway, who had a show about books. In January 2012, Ofcom banned the channel from operating in the UK after it was judged to have broadcast an interview made under duress.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Julian Assange \u2013 scourge of authoritarians; fan of Pussy Riot \u2013 fronted up for the Kremlin's Russia Today earlier this year. Assange interviewed controversial figures such as Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/apr/17/world-tomorrow-julian-assange-wikileaks\" title=\"\">but was criticised for his stilted delivery</a>, and for failing to delve into Russian human rights abuses.</p> <p>Why do the stations want them? Different channels have different reasons, says Khalil. \"Press TV was based in the UK, and directed towards a British audience,\" he says, \"so it had to fit inside that environment.\" Hence their range of politicians from across the political spectrum, all fairly familiar to British audiences.</p> <p>Al-Mayadeen, on the other hand, is Arab-based, and only wants to recruit Westerners who are both well-known in the Middle East, and who support their anti-Western politics. \"Galloway is the perfect fit for al-Mayadeen,\" says Khalil. \"He was on Arab television during every single uprising, war, and he came out very forcefully against Israel. Al-Mayadeen treats him like a superstar.\"</p> <p>And what's in it for Galloway? Attention, for one thing. \"I don't want to be mean,\" says Khalil, \"but he's constantly looking for a platform.\" The money's not bad, either. Galloway will earn \u00a33,000 an episode \u2013 or nearly \u00a380,000 a year \u2013 for his new project.</p> <p>Other lesser-known MPs turn to Press TV because they can't get heard otherwise. \"They may or may not object to the Iranian regime,\" says Chris Doyle, director of the <a href=\"http://www.caabu.org/\" title=\"\">Council for Arab-British Understanding</a>, \"but these channels provide a platform to the lesser-known MPs who don't get asked onto Newsnight to express their views on foreign policy.\"</p>",
  "<p>Over the last few years, at the kinds of conferences where the world's technological elite gathers to mainline caffeine and determine the course of history, Google has entertained the crowds with a contraption it calls <a href=\"http://www.google.com/earth/explore/showcase/liquidgalaxy.html\" title=\"Liquid Galaxy\">Liquid Galaxy</a>. It consists of eight large LCD screens, turned on their ends and arranged in a circle, with a joystick at the centre. The screens display vivid satellite imagery from Google Earth, and the joystick permits three-dimensional \"flight\", so that stepping inside Liquid Galaxy feels like boarding your own personal UFO, in which you can zoom from the darkness of space down to the ocean's surface, cruising low over deserts, or inspecting the tops of skyscrapers. (The illusion of real movement is powerful; your legs may tremble.) You can swoop down to street-level in Cape Town, spot ships in the Mekong river, or lose yourself in the whiteness of Antarctica.</p> <p>But you don't, of course. What you do \u2013 or what I did, anyway, but watch anyone using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/earth/index.html\" title=\"Google Earth\">Google Earth</a> for the first time, and you'll see they do the equivalent \u2013 is to hurtle across continents to the semi-detached house on the outskirts of York where you grew up, to peer down at a street you know well. In an era of previously unimagined opportunities for exploring the far-off and strange, we want mainly to stare at ourselves.</p> <p>It is a testament to the rate of change in the world of mapping, though, that Liquid Galaxy is now essentially old hat. Google has much, much bigger plans. In June it revealed that it had already started using planes \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/06/apple-google-using-military-grade-spy-planes-to-make-new-maps-says-senator/\" title=\"military-grade spy planes\">military-grade spy planes</a>\", the New York senator Charles Schumer claimed \u2013 to provide more detailed 3D imagery of the world's big cities. It also unveiled the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ae5MzPKAQ4\" title=\"Street View Trekker\">Street View Trekker</a>, a bulky backpack with several 15-megapixel cameras protruding on a stalk, so that operatives can capture \"offroad\" imagery from hiking trails, narrow alleyways or the forest floor. Almost every month, new kinds of data are incorporated into Google Maps: in June, it was 2,000 miles of British canal towpaths, complete with bridges and locks; it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2012/jul/12/google-maps-uk-cycle-routes\" title=\"bike lanes\">bike lanes</a>. And for the first time, Google's dominance of digital mapping faces a credible threat: Apple has announced that it will no longer include Google Maps on iPhones or iPads, replacing it with an alternative that, an Apple source told the tech blog All Things D, \"will blow your head off\".</p> <p>\"I honestly think we're seeing a more profound change, for mapmaking, than the switch from manuscript to print in the Renaissance,\" says the University of London cartographic historian Jerry Brotton. \"That was huge. But this is bigger.\" The transition to print gave far more people access to maps. The transition to ubiquitous digital mapping accelerates and extends that development \u2013 but it is also transforming the roles that maps play in our lives.</p> <p>The idea of a one-to-one scale map of the world, portraying everything in it, is a venerable device in literature, surfacing most famously in the work of Lewis Carroll and Jorge Luis Borges; in Harry Potter, there's a map that shows what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVBha-QUUCE\" title=\"everyone in Hogwarts is doing at every moment\">everyone in Hogwarts is doing at every moment</a>. But in the era of Street View Trekker and Liquid Galaxy, these fictional maps seem somewhat less absurd \u2013 and the level of detail is only one way in which maps are changing. Increasingly, the boundary between consulting a map and interacting with the world outside it is blurring: when Google glasses, currently in prototype, can project directions, or reviews of the restaurant you're looking at, directly into your visual field, what does the word \"map\" mean anymore? While researching his forthcoming book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/history-world-twelve-maps-review\" title=\"A History of the World in Twelve Maps\">A History of the World in Twelve Maps</a>, Brotton sometimes brought up the \"one-to-one map\" idea, from Borges and Carroll, with people at Google, but they didn't find it particularly witty or intriguing.</p> <p>\"Oh, yeah,\" they would reply, matter-of-factly. \"We can make that map.\"</p> <p>For many of us, pulling out a smartphone to find the quickest route to a meeting, or to the pub, is so ubiquitous a daily habit that it's hard to remember how absurdly recently it became possible. Google Maps was launched in 2005 \u2013 \"and that was the watershed,\" says David Heyman, a founder of the cartography company Axis Maps. \"Before that, we were on that old Mapquest thing \u2013 that was just an interface for loading a static map, really. But then Google Maps comes along, and suddenly you feel like you're in this seamless interactive environment.\" It became possible for users to create \"mashups\", building sites in which Google's basic maps were overlaid with other data: information about flats for rent, or the course of international warfare throughout history, or the best Indian restaurants in Glasgow.</p> <p>A couple of years beforehand, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had been fascinated by the zooming satellite imagery used by US news networks to report on bombing raids in Iraq. Those terrain graphics were provided by Keyhole, Inc, a software company that the CIA had helped to fund. Unlike the rest of us, Page and Brin had the wherewithal to act upon their fascination: they bought Keyhole, repackaging and releasing the firm's software as Google Earth in 2005. \"They say they bought it because it looked cool,\" says Brotton. \"But my view is that they absolutely knew what they were buying. They marketed it in this touchy-feely way, as an environmental thing, and they called it 'Earth' \u2013 'Google World' would have sounded imperialist. But they knew that what they were getting with Keyhole would be integral to the search business.\"</p> <p>There is a sense, in fact, in which mapping is the essence of what Google does. The company likes to talk about services such as Maps and Earth as if they were providing them for fun \u2013 a neat, free extra as a reward for using their primary offering, the search box. But a search engine, in some sense, is an attempt to map the world of information \u2013 and when you can combine that conceptual world with the geographical one, the commercial opportunities suddenly explode. Search results for restaurants or doctors or taxi firms mean far more, and present far juicier opportunities for advertisers, when they are geographically relevant. And then there's the most important point \u2013 the really exciting or troubling one, depending on your perspective. In a world of GPS-enabled smartphones, you're not just consulting Google or Apple data stores when you consult a map: you're adding to them.</p> <p>Exactly what information the companies collect, and what they do with it, remains much debated. But it's easy to grasp the basic commercial calculation. The more exactly your phone knows where you are, the more accurately you can be served with advertisements based on the places you'll be passing. (Ads on Google are already geo-targeted.) There's no technical reason why, perhaps in return for a cheaper phone bill, you mightn't consent to be shown not the quickest route between two points, but the quickest route that passes at least one Starbucks. If you're looking at the world through Google glasses, who determines which aspects of \"augmented reality\" data you see \u2013 and did they pay for the privilege? Combining GPS with the new Indoor Positioning System, which uses cellular and other phone data to track phones much more precisely, shops could easily track customers' movements among the aisles, adjusting displays on a&#xa0;day-by-day basis for maximum revenue.</p> <p>\"The map is mapping us,\" says Martin Dodge, a senior lecturer in human geography at Manchester University. \"I'm not paranoid, but I&#xa0;am quite suspicious and cynical about products that appear to be innocent and neutral, but that are actually vacuuming up all kinds of behavioural and attitudinal data.\"</p> <p>This is why, to techno-zealots and sceptics alike, the media panic over maps and privacy seems rather misplaced. \"Barbecuing or sunbathing in your backyard shouldn't be a public event,\" New York's senator Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \"People should be free of the worry of some hi-tech peeping tom technology violating one's privacy when in your own home.\" German law allows individuals to request the blurring of their homes on Street View. (<a href=\"http://buzzmachine.com/2010/11/02/germany-what-have-you-done/\" title=\"You have digitally desecrated your cities,\">\"You have digitally desecrated your cities,\"</a> the new-media commentator Jeff Jarvis responded in fury.) Certainly, this debate matters. But it's hard to interpret the occasional aerial snapshot of your garden as a big issue when the phone in your pocket is assembling a real-time picture of your movements, preferences and behaviour.</p> <p>Google and Apple insist, plausibly enough, that they're not interested in anyone's individual data: the commercial value lies in the patterns they can detect in the aggregate. But you'd be forgiven for not being entirely reassured. In any case, the concern that someone else might discover certain things about you isn't necessarily the most disorienting implication of the new generation of maps. More dizzying is the thought that \u2013 as maps based on mined data come to shape our sense of space, to navigate our journeys, and to narrow our online searches \u2013 Google's and Apple's maps might not just observe our lives, but in some sense come to play a role in&#xa0;directing their course.</p> <p>\"There's kind of a fine line that you run,\" said Ed Parsons, Google's chief geospatial technologist, in a session at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, \"between this being really useful, and it being creepy.\"</p> <p>For some, the ubiquity of maps \u2013 the way they are seeping into every corner of our \"real\", concrete world \u2013 triggers more nebulous, philosophical worries. With maps always in our pockets, or literally in front of our eyes, might we lose the ability to wander, and to get lost? If we're constantly glancing at our phones, or being bombarded by extra layers of data about where we're going, won't we become disconnected from the world around us? Is there something beneficial in having to stop to ask directions \u2013 an experience that will probably all but vanish, for most of us, in the next few years?</p> <p>Cartographers don't seem to see things this way. \"I actually think it's easier to get lost these days,\" says Heyman. \"Now, when I get to a new city, I can walk off wherever I like, without caring, because I know I'll be able to get back, consequence-free.\" And the idea that we're losing touch with reality doesn't hold water, argues Brotton. \"It's actually much more interesting than that.\" The really important question is: who controls the specific filters on which we're increasingly coming to rely? \"Google and Apple are saying that they want control over people's real and imagined space.\"</p> <p>Which brings us to the core of the matter. It can be easy to assume that maps are objective: that the world is out there, and that a good map is one that represents it accurately. But that's not true. Any square mile of the planet can be described in an infinite number of ways: in terms of its natural features, its weather, its socio-economic profile, or what you can buy in the shops there. Traditionally, the interests reflected in maps have been those of states and their armies, because they were the ones who did the mapmaking, and the primary use of many such maps was military. (If you had the better maps, you stood a good chance of winning the battle. <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Ordnance+Survey+logo&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=btI8UKDEMam80QXS7YAg&amp;ved=0CFUQsAQ&amp;biw=1242&amp;bih=913\" title=\"The Ordnance Surveys logo\">The Ordnance Survey's logo</a> still includes a visual reference to the 18th-century War Department.) Now, the power is shifting. \"Every map,\" the cartography curator Lucy Fellowes once said, \"is someone's way of getting you to look at the world his or her way.\" What happens when we come to see the world, to a significant extent, through the eyes of a handful of big companies based in California? You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist, or an anti-corporate crusader, to wonder about the subtle ways in which their values and interests might come to shape our lives.</p> <p>The question cartographers are always being asked at cocktail parties, says Heyman, is whether there's really any mapmaking still left to do: we've mapped the whole planet already, haven't we? The question could hardly be more misconceived. We are just beginning to grasp what it means to live in a world in which maps are everywhere \u2013 and in which, by using maps, we are mapped ourselves.</p>",

  "<p>While the front row assembled for the autumn/winter collections this February in silver leather leggings (Daphne Guinness), printed catsuits (MIA) and luxe nurse's scrubs (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/mar/03/fashion-most-dedicated-follower\" title=\"\">Anna Della Russo</a>), the catwalk looked positively sedate. Workwear, usually far too sensible for high fashion, was in focus. Not since Armani and Donna Karan advocated power suiting in the 80s, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1l1Ga5tSYQ\" title=\"\">Melanie Griffith brokered deals in Working Girl</a>, has what we wear to work got the designer treatment.</p> <p>Overlooked previously in favour of club kids or eccentric inventors, the working woman becomes a fashion muse this season, with her environment \u2013 the office \u2013 suddenly stylish. Richard Nicoll dedicated his collection to the professional woman, with knee-length skirts, all-day heels and shirting, and brands including Jonathan Saunders, Christopher Kane and Balenciaga showed their collections in office towers. While Balenciaga's filmy slipdresses may raise a few eyebrows in a real office, the broad strokes of Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re's collection for the brand \u2013 knee skirts, smart trousers, nipped-in jackets \u2013 were very much SFW. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/mar/01/paris-fashion-week-balenciaga\" title=\"\">Backstage</a> in March, the designer said he was inspired by an imaginary \"Balenciaga Inc\", with \"different women dressing for different business areas\".</p> <p>It's not Ghesqui\u00e8re, of course, who can be credited with making workwear cool. That was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/mar/04/celine-phoebe-philo-paris-fashion-week\" title=\"\">Phoebe Philo</a>. The creative director of C\u00e9line since 2009, her first collection for the brand \"changed the way we look at fashion\", says Penny Martin, editor-in-chief at women's fashion magazine <a href=\"http://www.thegentlewoman.com/\" title=\"\">the Gentlewoman</a>. In Philo's hands, fashion was about individual items \u2013 smart trousers, great shirts, sensible shifts \u2013 rather than trends. \"It's about wardrobe-led clothes,\" says Martin, who featured Philo on the cover of the Gentlewoman's first issue.</p> <p>Other names on this trajectory? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/gallery/2012/mar/05/stalla-mccartney-paris-fashion-week-2012\" title=\"\">Stella McCartney</a>, Chlo\u00e9's Clare Waight Keller, Sam Cam favourite Emilia Wickstead and Jane Shepherdson at Whistles. While the catwalk pushes a mood of the season, the larger, more commercial collections presented to buyers after the show contain the pieces that cross over to real life. \"I got really excited buying Stella's pre-collection because there was everything for a woman's wardrobe,\" says Natalie Kingham, international buyer at <a href=\"http://www.matchesfashion.com/\" title=\"\">Matches</a>, \"clothes for a whole week.\" Although prohibitively expensive for many, the influence of these brands is seen across the high street and, in turn, in offices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395320278\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/28/1346166091957/Melanie-Griffith-in-Worki-010.jpg\" alt=\"Melanie Griffith in Working Girl\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last time workwear hit the catwalks was the 80s, when Melanie Griffith starred in Working Girl.

The average UK worker clocks in 42.7 hours \u2013 or around 38% of our waking week \u2013 and probably spends more time with colleagues than friends. Designers now realise that workwear is a relatively untapped market. \"Fashion has been focused on eveningwear but daywear is becoming increasingly important,\" says Nicoll. His take on workwear has a definite fashion slant and includes colour-blocking and leather.</p> <p>But could you actually wear it to the average office? Although Nicoll's collection is considered, there's a sense that designers \u2013 who can, one assumes, wear a pirate outfit to work if they like \u2013 do no share your boss's idea of what's work-appropriate. Rebecca Netherton, a senior marketing executive, has a leather pencil skirt \"but I wouldn't wear it to the office \u2013 it would be too much of a talking point,\" she says. \"I don't want to look like an office drone but clothes can't be the first thing someone thinks about when they meet&#xa0;me.\"</p> <p>Aimee Nisbet, who is head of legal at Hearst, and is often the only woman in meetings, believes gender issues come into play. \"If you're working with men in suits, it would look weird to come to meeting in a vest and sandals,\" she says. \"I need to look tailored but I want to keep the sense that I am a woman too.\" Her workwear shopping list includes a pair of monogrammed trousers from Stella McCartney and a coat from Christopher Kane. \"It's great to see workwear on the catwalk,\" she says. \"I spend money on clothes I wear at work and this gives me a little more fashionability.\"</p> <p>Clothes express personality \u2013 no matter how much you want to downplay them. But they also reflect our lifestyles \u2013 from breakfast with the kids to a client meeting and drinks after work. \"There's no separation between my week and weekend wardrobe,\" says Esme Wren, an executive producer at Sky News. \"I like to keep things fluid.\" This is an attitude that's growing, says Treena Lombardo, the fashion director of <a href=\"http://shopbop.com/\" title=\"\">shopbop.com</a>, which has a workwear boutique on the site. \"Women want pieces that suit more than one area,\" she says, pointing to blazers \u2013 particularly bestseller Rebecca Minkoff's draped \"Becky\" \u2013 as a good example. \"You can wear it over anything \u2013 it makes a dress businesslike, and doubles as outerwear.\"</p> <p>Hard-working clothes for hard-working women \u2013 that's what we want now.</p>",
  "<h2>'ARRY'S GAME</h2> <p>Some things are guaranteed to trigger nostalgia. Christmas decorations, for instance, can stir memories of childhoods unwrapping Scalextrix boxes; and Scorpions' Winds of Change always gets the Fiver pining for a time when a man could whistle his way to global acclaim while wearing a leather cap (hands up who else suspects Howard Webb wishes he was born decade or two earlier). And you know that the last week of this summer's transfer window has got to get good ol' 'Arry Redknapp aching for the days when he could trade real life footballers like they were Panini stickers.</p> <p>As if to soothe the maddening itch that 'Arry must be feeling at the moment, some papers have today carried stories suggesting that the Football-Manager-Who-Is-Emphatically-Not-a-Wheeler-Dealer-No-Siree is on the verge of a return to football management \u2013 at a London club, apparently, but while such reports may provide a modicum of relief for 'Arry, that effect is surely more than offset by the buzz emanating from his old stomping ground, as Tottenham Hotspur prepare to augment his torment by embarking on a frantic binge before Friday's deadline.</p> <p>Having waited almost the entire summer to complete the sale of Luka Modric to Real Madrid just so as to add an amusing gameshow feel to their strategy, Spurs are now dashing around the world trying to shift and hire enough players to assemble a coherent squad before Friday's deadline.

Attacking midfielders such as Moussa Dembele, Joao Moutinho and Shakhtar Donestk's Willian are also said to feature on their shopping list. But will they really offload Michael Dawson and Tom Huddlestone? Will they finally land a new striker or two?

  "<h2>Chi kind of town</h2> <p>The Chicago Cubs are the loveable losers. Their neighbors to the south, the White Sox, have also had their share of losing seasons, but they seem to be lot less lovable, even after winning that elusive title back in 2005. </p> <p>Despite a title drought of more than 100 years, the Cubs have a nationwide fan base and, of course, they have Wrigley Field. The Sox had <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ShlV8Y5pYv4/THLEG7ZfZCI/AAAAAAAABXA/vly3ulg3OlM/s1600/Old-Comiskey-Park,-Chicago,-Illinois.jpg\">old Comiskey Park</a>, a venue that had the unfortunate distinction of sharing a city that is home one of the world's great sporting destinations. Today they play in US Cellular Field, which I hear is <a href=\"http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/comis2.htm\">a lot better now</a> than it was when it opened in 1991. </p> <p>No, there's no doubt about it \u2013 the White Sox are second-class citizens in Chicago. Perhaps this is one reason they have routinely cried out for attention. The Sox had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6pUm5SHfMA\">Bill Veeck</a>, their showman owner, who was the brains behind first exploding scoreboard and also gave the baseball world Disco Demolition night. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I1CP1751wJA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I1CP1751wJA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Then there are the uniforms. There have been no fewer than 10 what I would call <a href=\"http://www.whitesoxinteractive.com/rwas/index.php?category=3&amp;id=2104\">major changes in either colors and/or design since 1901</a>, including the infamous<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NucpYnti19s\"> jammies they wore in 1979</a>, another Veeck gag. That's not exactly the way to forge an identity. </p> <p>The latest Sox change didn't come from a switch in their threads (although they have occasionally been wearing those 1971 red pinstriped uniforms this season), but with their manager. The outrageous Ozzie Guill\u00e9n left town in controversial fashion towards the end of last season, which I suppose was always going to happen. Then owner Jerry Reinsdorf followed by bringing in Guill\u00e9n's polar opposite, Robin Ventura, who is a steady as they come (the exception being Saturday when he was <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24211233&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24211233&amp;v=3\">ejected after bumping an umpire</a>), and has his team playing in a similar fashion in 2012. </p> <p>Ventura's first-place Chicago White Sox aren't likely to be going away anytime soon. In fact, they are getting better as the season progresses, the sign of a true contender. </p> <p>The Pirates have gotten a lot of attention for their unexpected playoff run, and deservedly so. After all, they haven't had a single season of .500 ball since 1992. Baltimore have gotten fewer props for their improvement, but are still on the 2012 feelgood radar, as are the Oakland A's, who, you have to admit, are putting on a spectacular show. I'm not so sure we have given enough love to these Chicago White Sox, who are probably the best of those four winning teams who weren't given much hope of success this season. They are 15-9 in August, on top of the American League Central, and are still holding off the Detroit Tigers, who continue to be stymied in their season of false dawns. </p> <p>The White Sox won six straight heading into Monday, which included a sweep of the Yankees at home, something that no Chisox team had done in over 20 years. They also swept the Seattle Mariners, the post-Ichiro M's who had won 10 of 12 games heading into the Windy City. The Chisox even managed to survive Friday's encounter, when they <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24185563&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24185563&amp;v=3\">allowed six Seattle runs</a> in the ninth inning, only to come back in the bottom half of the inning to thwart Seattle's valiant play. </p> <p>They do almost everything well \u2013 they hit, hit for power and catch the ball and they can certainly pitch. Chris Sale, the lifeblood of the staff and arguably the entire team, put together arguably his<a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24139697&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24139697&amp;v=3\"> best performance of the year </a>for the Yanks, striking out 13 in seven-plus innings and allowing a single run on three hits to earn his 15th win. It's been a rapid ascension for the 2010 first-round choice, who threw a grand total of <a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/salech01.shtml\">10.1 innings in the minor leagues</a> before being promoted to the big club. </p> <p>While the Washington Nationals' Stephen Strasburg is likely <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/26/twtjz-analytics-poll-shut-stephen-strasburg-down/\">heading to the stables soon</a>, the 23-year-old Sale \u2013 who, granted, isn't recovering from surgery but has yet to throw more than the 71 innings he threw in relief last year \u2013 will continue for the rest of the season, more than doubling that inning total in 2012. </p> <p>Having a third-year hurler compete for a Cy Young award is just one of many things going right on the South Side. Take Adam Dunn, who has rebounded from a 2011 season that could not have been worse. He was so bad that the slugger recently told ESPN's John Kruk that one piece of advice he had been given last year was to \"take two weeks off and quit\". Good thing he didn't because he has hit 38 home runs this season, which almost makes that .203 batting average and 182 strikeouts worth it. </p> <p>Combine that sort of comeback season with that of Alex Rios, whose productivity is completely unexpected, the success of AJ Pierzynski, the 19 homers from Day\u00e1n Viciedo and the presence of Kevin Youkilis and you have a formidable lineup before I even drop Paul Konerko's name. </p> <p>Meanwhile young starter Jos\u00e9 Quintana, who began his season in the minor leagues, is wearing a spring training type uniform number but putting up big league numbers, the most important being his 2.86 ERA. Jake Peavy hasn't been as good in the second half, but he continues to provide more than these Sox could have expected coming to the season. They got a break with Gavin Floyd's recent MRI on his elbow that showed<a href=\"http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120827&amp;content_id=37423338&amp;notebook_id=37430704&amp;vkey=notebook_cws&amp;c_id=cws\"> no structural damage</a>, while Francisco Liriano hasn't given up more than two runs in each of his previous three starts. Sure, the bullpen is a bit wanting (<a href=\"http://www.csnchicago.com/baseball-chicago-whitesox/whitesox-talk/Sox-dont-see-confidence-loss-for-Reed-af?blockID=763005&amp;feedID=10338\">see the Mariners' six-run ninth on Friday</a>), with a rookie closer in Addison Reed posting an ERA of over 4.00. But it could be worse (see Mets). </p> <p>The biggest shame about these Sox, as fun as they are, is that few in Chicago seem to be watching. Their attendance ranks <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/white-sox/post/_/id/11735/even-with-yanks-in-town-soxs-attendance-low\">ninth of 14 AL teams</a> \u2013 this despite the engaging product they have put on the field, all while the Cubs continue to draw in a city where winning clearly isn't everything. </p> <h2>Fortune favors the Braves</h2> <p>There has been lotss of talk about the Red Sox encore to the 2011 September collapse. The Braves, less. While Boston got a new GM and a new manager in the upheaval that followed, the Braves chopped fewer heads, choosing instead to replace the hitting coach and then <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/blog/danny-knobler/19872735/while-the-red-sox-have-turmoil,-the-braves-have-another-playoff-chase-%28and-few-thoughts-of-collapse%29\">take another crack at it with mostly the same personnel. </a>Today Atlanta are in a position to make the playoffs and the Red Sox are not. </p> <p>It hasn't been easy for Atlanta, who have won a good amount more than they've lost but still battled inconsistency, not to mention injuries. Pitcher Brandon Beachy <a href=\"http://aol.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2012-06-20/brandon-beachy-injury-update-tommy-john-surgery-atlanta-braves\">is long gone</a> while Ben Sheets, who energized the rotation after returning from a two-year injury hiatus, is back in a familiar place \u2013 the DL. Tommy Hanson has also been sidelined in the second half. </p> <p>Still, despite being forced into cobbling together a rotation that has featured no fewer than eight pitchers since the All-Star Game, Atlanta have put together <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/team/_/stat/pitching/split/182/league/nl\">the best ERA in the National League since the break.</a> Take away the poor performances of Hanson, Jair Jurrgens and reliever Anthony Varvaro and just about everyone else has been lights out. The arms have helped keep this streaky team alive in August, a month that has seen the club win seven of nine, followed by five losses in eight. Without that quality pitching, this team would be free-falling September-style, but instead they are not only sticking around but are just <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings\">five games behind Washington in the NL East. They hold a four-game cushion in the race for the wild card. </a></p> <p>If only the bats could have hit just a bit over the past few weeks, Atlanta would be further threatening the Nationals. Instead, they've hit just .237, a disappointing stretch for a team that has scored the second most runs in the National League. </p> <p>You still have to wonder where this team would be without their 40-year-old third baseman, Chipper Jones. The future hall of famer <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/cutfour/index.jsp#contentId=37460882\">playing remarkably in his final season</a> is hitting over .300 with an OPS approaching .900. Actually, the main punch comes from Jones, Jason Heyward \u2013 who has had an excellent comeback season \u2013 and Freddie Freeman. After that it thins out and makes you wonder just how manager Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez got this band of overachieving Bravos to where they are today \u2013 third-best in the NL. </p> <p>Now we're heading into September with the team in a comfortable position and facing a<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/2012-schedule-scores.shtml\"> cupcake schedule. </a>Over the next few weeks they have the Padres, Phillies, Rockies, Mets and Brewers, before hosting Washington. Those teams are soft, but it will soon be September, a month in which these Braves will have to prove management's theory \u2013 that 2011 was indeed just a fluke. </p> <h2>A Vin Vin situation</h2> <p>Don't be fooled: the big news out of LA this weekend wasn't the nine-player deal that landed the Dodgers roughly $263m in future salary commitments, and possibly in the World Series. No, it was that Vin Scully<a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24246281&amp;topic_id=8878826&amp;c_id=la&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24246281&amp;v=3\"> announced that he will be returning to the broadcast booth</a> in 2013 \u2013 much to the relief of anyone who cares about baseball. </p> <p>Do you think Vin got jazzed up about Adrian Gonzalez, Josh Beckett and Carl Crawford, plus whatever other trinkets Magic Johnson and his Merry Men of Money bring to Dodger Stadium next season? Well, yes, considering Scully told mlb.com that: \"I wondered with the new ownership. How fast will they move? How high will they try to take the team?\"</p> <p>Apart from the new vibe around Chavez Ravine, Scully also expressed a desire to visit Yankee Stadium, as the Dodgers will play in the Bronx for an Interleague set next season \u2013 that is, if they don't reach New York this October. </p> <p>Then there's the fact that if Vin Scully isn't calling a game, which he has done for 63 seasons, then what is he doing?</p> <p>\"If you give a toy to a little child, especially a boy, he's going to start asking questions,\" Scully told baseball's official website. \"How far will it go? How high will it go? How fast will it go? I think like Roy Campanella said, 'You have to have a lot of little boy in you to play this game.' I think you have to a have a lot of little boy to love this game. I still have that little boy.\"</p> <h2>A-Gone</h2> <p>After Adrian Gonzalez drove in four runs in his first two games as a Dodger, both victories, the lowly <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=24274651&amp;topic_id=&amp;c_id=mlb&amp;tcid=vpp_copy_24274651&amp;v=3\">Colorado Rockies took a bit of the shine off Los Angeles</a>, defeating what some are calling baseball's version of \"Showtime\" 10-0. Josh Beckett went 5.2 innings giving up three runs, striking out six and walking three in his Dodgers debut. Gonzalez was 0-3 with a walk, but he provided the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/baseball/mlb/dodgers/la-sp-0827-dodgers-marlins-20120827,0,1501429.story\">LA Times</a> with much more interesting material on Monday.</p> <p>On the media:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"They didn't like that I was a calm person. I won't throw my helmet, I won't scream, I won't use bad words if I strike out. That's what they want over there.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Fenway:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"What took my power away was the Green Monster [the 37-foot wall at Boston's Fenway Park]. </p> <p>\"I used to hit line drives that way and they would be doubles. That took away five home runs from me last year. So I would have had 32.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>At a <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-adrian-gonzalez-josh-beckett-20120826,0,4467640.story\">Saturday press conference</a>, Gonzalez gave us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Last year, everybody was telling me to take more of a leadership role at the end of the year. This year, I tried to be more outspoken, and whenever you say certain things and do certain things, sometimes they fire back the wrong way.</p> <p>\"Everything I ever did was for the sake of winning, and I think everybody over there in that clubhouse knows it. The way things were spinned, looking back, maybe there were a couple of things, well, I shouldn't say a couple of things... one thing I should not have done.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's no way to say for sure, but there's a decent chance that Gonzalez is referencing his sending a text message to the Red Sox ownership requesting a meeting with some players, to complain about manager Bobby Valentine. Actually, I'm surprised that he was willing to provide that much insight into the texting saga so quickly. These quotes reveal everything you need to know about how key it was to get Gonzalez out of Boston. It was already ugly and odds are that wasn't going to get any better. </p> <h2>The Spaceman cometh... again</h2> <p>There's a lot of talk about<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/26/roger-clemens-pitches-sugar-land\"> Roger Clemens and his potential return to Major League Baseball,</a> a move that some skeptics believe is designed to delay his eligibility for the Hall of Fame. Should \"The Rocket\" suit up for the Houston Astros, his likely landing spot should he get back to the bigs, Clemens \u2013 who was linked to steroids on almost nine pages of the controversial 2007 Mitchell Report and recently acquitted of federal charges that he obstructed and lied to Congress in denying he used performance-enhancing drugs \u2013 would not be eligible to be enshrined in Cooperstown for another five years. In that case, Clemens would be banking on time healing at least enough wounds. </p> <p>In Texas, Clemens pitched well in 3.1 scoreless innings of work for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League. He said after the game that he wasn't thinking of a comeback. </p> <p>Days earlier, in San Francisco, another former pitcher associated with drugs was on the mound. On Thursday, 65-year-old Bill \"Spaceman\" Lee, who won 17 games in three consecutive seasons for the Boston Red Sox before finishing his career in Montreal, threw 119 pitches for the San Rafael Pacifics,<a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/columns/slideshow/Bill-Lee-wins-professional-game-at-65-47955.php\"> becoming the oldest player to win a professional game.</a> </p> <p>Lee \u2013 who once told a reporter that he sprinkled THC on organic buckwheat pancakes before his daily five-mile jog, to prevent gas, words that landed him in hot water with then baseball commissioner, Bowie Kuhn \u2013 gave an interview to <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5877555/the-fans-would-throw-little-tinfoils-of-hash-at-me-a-1980-interview-with-bill-spaceman-lee-baseballs-stoner-evangelist\">High Times Magazine in 1980</a>, during which he had some interesting things about the use in baseball of drugs of a different kind:</p> <p><strong>High Times:</strong> Let's talk for a moment about the drugs that are sanctioned \u2013 indeed, virtually mandatory \u2013 in organized sports, such as novocaine, cortisone, the steroids...</p> <p><strong>Lee: </strong>It's all rotgut. Your kidneys produce enough cortisone. As far as the management is concerned, the short-term goals outweigh the long-term ones. Novocaine and steroids, especially. It's ironic that Bowie Kuhn gets upset about pot when, every day, ballplayers are being shot up with drugs that actually destroy players' systems. He's thinking short-term. He's not taking into consideration, for instance, that steroids are congenital and that the people who take them are passing on heart failure to their offspring that will make them die at a much earlier age because of inability to absorb cholesterol. He's thinking, \"This guy is more of a burden, costs more on society in the long run based on our insurance...\" It's strange, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>High Times: </strong>So you're saying that baseball management is abusing drugs, in effect?<br><strong><br>Lee:</strong> Yeah. Because they create the system whereby the ballplayer knows that if he does good, he's gonna get x number of dollars and then he can worry about it later. Overachieving at a faster rate. It's the same thing as marginal buying on the stock market, which created the crash of 1929.</p> <p>Interesting, especially in 1980. </p> <p>Anyway, the coverage of Lee's accolade made me recall one of my favorite baseball clips, a 1979 CBC<a href=\"http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/MON/MON197905300.shtml\"> post-game interview</a> (only audio is available, but definitely worth a listen) that featured amusing insight into his pre-game meal, and how he felt about his move to Montreal from Boston. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylBywQtsp6E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylBywQtsp6E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p>",
  "<p>Iran's opposition has urged the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, to visit political prisoners and press the regime over its human rights record during a controversial trip to Tehran for a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement this week.</p> <p>Ban defied calls from America and Israel to boycott the gathering in Iran, the country's biggest international conference in three decades, which will be attended by senior officials from more than 100 nations. Another high-profile participant will be Mohamed Morsi, the first Egyptian president to visit Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>Not far from the summit venue in north Tehran, a number of Iranian activists are behind bars in Tehran's notorious Evin prison. The opposition hopes to use the high-profile visits to highlight the plight of political prisoners, especially the regime's treatment of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, who have been under house arrest for more than 18 months.</p> <p>Mousavi, a former presidential candidate, was reported to have been hospitalised for a heart condition last week but was later discharged. He continues to be held under house arrest, with little information disclosed about his health.</p> <p>\"We expect the secretary general to use his status as the highest-ranking UN official to question the Iranian authorities over their treatment of Mr Mousavi, his wife and Mr Karroubi, and request a meeting with them,\" Ardeshir Amir-Arjomand, a spokesman for Mousavi, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a group of Iranian academics and activists have written a letter to the secretary general, calling on him to use his visit to highlight \"the dire conditions of human rights\" in Iran and meet Mousavi and Karroubi.</p> <p>\"Your imminent visit to Tehran to participate in the upcoming Non-Aligned Movement conference shall provide a unique opportunity to assess the dire conditions of human rights in Iran first hand,\" said the letter, signed by more than 400 intellectuals. \"In the name of humanity and the United Nations charter, [we] appeal to you to intervene for ending the deteriorating conditions of human rights, state-sponsored violence and prejudice in Iran.\" Activists have made similar requests to the Egyptian president and Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh.</p> <p>Ban's spokesman, Martin Nesirky, said he would convey the concerns of the international community. \"I can assure you the secretary general fully intends to discuss human rights with the Iranian authorities, including at the highest level,\" he said.</p> <p>The British foreign secretary, William Hague, recently condemned Iran's leadership for the \"continued, widespread persecution of ethnic minorities, human rights defenders and political prisoners\".</p> <p>\"The Iranian government should know that its systematic attempt to curtail the freedom of its citizens will not go unchallenged by the international community and only adds to its isolation,\" he said on Friday.</p> <p>At a time of financial stringency caused by western economic sanctions, Iran is using Tehran's summit to defy suggestions that it is being internationally isolated over its disputed nuclear programme. A new report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on the country's nuclear activities is expected to be disclosed later this week.</p> <p>Iran claims that its nuclear activities are peaceful and it is the victim of a western-led covert campaign against its nuclear scientists. On the sidelines of the summit, Iran has displayed cars wrecked in the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists and is seeking backing from the members of the movement for its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Iran's semi-official Fars news agency quoted a senior official, Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi of the parliamentary committee on research and education, as saying that Ban would be asked by Iranian parliamentarian about \"the UN's silence\" over the assassination of Iranian scientists.</p> <h2>Legacy of imperialism and the cold war</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nam.gov.za/\" title=\"\">Non-Aligned Movement </a>has its roots in the depths of the cold war. Its founding principles emerged from a meeting in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955, when leaders of developing countries attempted to chart an alternative path to taking sides in the all-consuming rivalry between the West and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Its founders included champions of the struggle against colonialism: Suharno of Indonesia, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, and Jawaharlal Nehru of India, as well Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt and Josip Broz Tito of what was then Yugoslavia. It was Tito, anxious to underline his independence from Moscow, who hosted the first formal summit in Belgrade in 1961.</p> <p>The collapse of Yugoslavia in the early nineties crystallised the NAM's dilemma over what it stood for in a post-cold war world. The disconnect between the Bandung principles, such as respect for human rights and the United Nations charter, and the behaviour of many of the major member states had been apparent long before.</p> <p>In recent years it has recast itself as a force pushing for redistribution of global wealth and power from the rich north to a poor south, working alongside the Group of 77 developing countries at the UN, for fairer structures in international institutions, particularly the UN security council.</p> <p>The 2003 invasion of Iraq gave the movement new vigour, as opposition to the excesses of the \"war on terror\" became a rallying point, rekindling bitter memories of imperialism. The NAM represents an important bloc on the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), where its members have resisted pressure on Iran, portraying it as bullying by the established nuclear powers. However, it lost an important test of strength with the US and its allies in the vote for a new IAEA director general in 2009, when Washington's preferred candidate, Yukiya Amano, beat South Africa's Abdul Minty. The large turnout of NAM leaders this week in Tehran can be seen in part as a backlash to that defeat, and a <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/27/iran_non_alignment\" title=\"\">gesture of defiance</a> in Iran's defence against western sanctions and the threat of an Israeli attack.</p> <p><strong>Julian Borger </strong></p>",
  "<p>When the wind on Orkney is strong enough to blow the rain parallel to the pavement, the cluster of gently sloping islands becomes a green energy powerhouse.</p> <p>There are hundreds of small wind turbines dotted across the islands, tall punctuation marks outside farmhouses, cottages and engineering yards, and more than a dozen large commercial machines. On Monday, as the wind gusted to 45mph, they were powering homes on the Scottish mainland with surplus energy, feeding more than 23 megawatts of electricity into the grid.</p> <p>Best known for its Neolithic sites such as Skara Brae, its beef and its fishing expertise, Orkney has quietly but very deliberately become arguably the most self-sufficient community in the British Isles for its energy, and is home to many of the world's most advanced wave and tidal power machines. On Tuesday, in Orkney's second town of Stromness, that status was confirmed when Nicola Sturgeon, deputy first minister of Scotland, announced the world's most lucrative renewable energy competition: the \u00a310m <a href=\"http://www.saltireprize.com/\" title=\"\">Saltire prize challenge</a>.</p> <p>Four marine energy firms have entered their wave- and tide-powered devices.</p> <p>There is the <a href=\"http://www.pelamiswave.com/\" title=\"\">Pelamis P2 \"sea snake\"</a>, a long, jointed device that harnesses energy by undulating with the waves off Sutherland; <a href=\"http://www.aquamarinepower.com/blog/oyster-800-commences-operational-testing/\" title=\"\">Aquamarine Power's Oyster 800,</a> in which a large flap catches the waves' power off the Western Isles; <a href=\"http://www.meygen.com/\" title=\"\">MeyGen</a>'s tidal energy scheme in the powerful waters of the Pentland Firth, off Caithness, using underwater propellers anchored to the seabed; and ScottishPower Renewables, with scores of similar tidal turbines off Caithness. To win the Saltire prize, these machines must produce at least 100 gigawatt hours of electricity over a continuous two-year period between now and 2017. So far only four tidal- and wave-power devices being tested at the <a href=\"http://www.emec.org.uk/\" title=\"\">European Marine Energy Centre (Emec)</a> at Stromness have produced electricity for sustained periods. Even then, that was over a matter of days, not months.</p> <p>There is scepticism within the renewables industry about the purpose of the Saltire prize: the costs of entering it far outweigh its value. The real goal for the renewables industry is so obvious \u2013 to harness the immense energy of the sea, and tap into a global market predicted to be worth \u00a31tn \u2013 that its existence changes little.</p> <p>Martin McAdam, chief executive of Aquamarine Power, said his firm would need to spend some \u00a360m building and then installing at least 20 of his Oyster 800s off the Western Isles to win the Saltire.</p> <p>But what it does do, said McAdam, is give his industry a significant boost of confidence. \"I like to say no one builds their business plan on the basis of winning a prize but the Saltire prize will bring focus on to the industry,\" he said.</p> <p>After years of ill-fated attempts to find a viable marine energy device, the industry is now on the threshold of a breakthrough into building commercially viable machines able to compete with offshore wind, and capable of replacing coal-fired power stations.</p> <p>The <a href=\" http://renews.biz/renews_europe_home.php\" title=\"\">magazine reNews</a> estimates that the renewables industry will install 16 megawatts worth of wave and tidal machines during 2012 \u2013 four times more than last year \u2013 while global engineering and energy groups such as Rolls-Royce, Siemens and Alstom are now buying up the pioneering firms, which have created the first viable devices.</p> <p>Neil Kermode, managing director of Emec, the largest wave and tidal testing centre in the world, said that was a clear signal that the immense potential of marine energy \u2013 particularly around the British Isles \u2013 was being recognised. A tidal machine developed in Northern Ireland by Marine Current Turbines \u2013 now owned by Siemens \u2013 has already generated 3Gwh of electricity, a world record, reNews has disclosed.</p> <p>\"We're trying to work with various countries around the world, because we know how to get the technology to work,\" Kermode said. \"It's quite a planetary imperative: there's a huge amount of energy out there and the sooner we can do this, the sooner we can decarbonise.\"</p> <p>Orkney's desirability as a marine energy centre is shown every day at Emec's tidal testing range at Fall of Warness, a tide race off the island of Eday. Here is one of the world's strongest tides: its speed peaks at four metres per second, forcing through half a billion tonnes of seawater every hour.</p> <p>Estimates suggest that around the Scottish islands, wind, wave and tidal power could generate 38,500 gigawatt hours a year, and these machines could have a nominal capacity of 11 gigawatts, equivalent to three coal-fired power stations as large as Drax in north Yorkshire, the UK's largest.</p> <p>McAdam predicts that wave and tidal machines will be as cheap to run as offshore wind turbines by 2017; by 2025, there will be vast marine energy farms at sea, generating hundreds of megawatts of electricity.</p> <p>Many of the UK's earliest tidal power generators will be based around Orkney, the Pentland Firth and nearby Shetland. But Orcadians, brought up with an ethos of self-reliance and living daily with some of the UK's highest energy prices, have embraced micro-renewables with a gusto rarely seen elsewhere in the UK.</p> <p>For a population of 20,000, there is already 55 megawatts of installed capacity, chiefly from several small commercial wind farms. In addition, there are now about 450 privately owned wind turbines and perhaps as many as 100 solar panel arrays and more than 150 ground-source heat pumps fitted to homes, schools and offices.</p> <p>With extra machines being installed now, Gareth Davies of the Stromness-based renewables consultancy <a href=\"http://www.aquatera.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Aquatera</a> estimates that 85% of Orkney's entire electricity demand will be met by its home-grown renewables industry by early 2013. It will soon exceed 100%.</p> <p>Six communities own their own large wind turbines \u2013 each turn of the blades earns them 7p \u2013 and 10 more are considering it. On the island of Shapinsay, the community has bought a minibus, employed an out-of-hours ferryman able to take them to the cinema in Kirkwall and is planning to buy its own boat. The council has begun running Scotland's only electricity-powered lorry: it collects refuse in and around Kirkwall.</p> <p>\"What Orkney is doing in UK terms is it's the first community which has embraced renewables as part of everyday life, where individual households are investing in a renewable energy future,\" said Davies. \"It's a community in every sense: it's the local council, it's groups of people and it's individuals with that community, making that commitment.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2012. The original said estimates suggest that tidal and wave power around Orkney could generate 38,500 gigawatt hours a year, equivalent to three coal-fired power stations as large as Drax in North Yorkshire. The potential output from tidal, wave and wind machines for the area is 38,500 gigawatt hours a year. It is the nominal capacity of these machines, 11 gigawatts, that equals three times that of a power station such as Drax.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>A revolution in medical research in Britain is to give academics and the life sciences industry unparalleled access to the cradle-to-grave health records of about 52 million people in England.</p> <p>Studies of NHS records first revealed the dangers of thalidomide; established an association between power lines and childhood leukaemia; showed autism had nothing to do with the MMR vaccine; and more recently highlighted England's poor cancer survival rates, a problem that lay mostly in late diagnosis. The result was a government campaign to raise awareness of early symptoms, such as a cough that lasts more than three weeks, with the <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/tag/be-clear-on-cancer/\" title=\"\">aim of saving 5,000 more lives by 2015</a>.</p> <p>Now ministers have overseen the creation of new systems to encourage a surge in studies that draw on public health records. From September GP practices will be encouraged to take part in the scheme, through the <a href=\"http://www.cprd.com/intro.asp\" title=\"\">Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD)</a>.</p> <p>An uneasy question hung in the air when Britain banned smoking in enclosed public places. There was room for unintended consequences. Deprived of their usual haunts, smokers might light up more at home.</p> <p>In Scotland, where the ban first came into force, nearly half of five-year-olds lived with a smoker. The fear was that a ban intended to reduce smoking might increase exposure among children. But the enforced ban seems to have sparked voluntary smoking bans at home.</p> <p>Reassurance came when researchers trawled electronic hospital records for cases of children admitted with serious asthma attacks from 2000 to 2009, a period that straddled the ban's introduction in Scotland. Linking the electronic records together, all 21,415 of them, gave the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1002861\" title=\"\">first clear picture of child health after the ban</a>. The number of pre-school children hospitalised with asthma began to fall after yearly rises of 9% before the law changed.</p> <p>The government is now proposing to make this sort of study much easier to carry out. The CPRD will link health records on a scale never seen before, connecting patient information from GPs and hospitals to other records, such as disease and mental health registries and genetics databases. The combined datasets can be searched to answer medical research questions, and the results shared with scientists once they have been anonymised to protect patients' privacy. In time CPRD will add other records, such as pollution data, social care records and data from <a href=\"http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Biobank</a> \u2013 which is charting the health of 500,000 people \u2013 and hook up with similar systems that cover smaller populations in <a href=\"http://www.scot-ship.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Scotland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adls.ac.uk/secure-anonymised-information-linkage-databank/\" title=\"\">Wales</a>.</p> <p>The ambitious project <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/dec/government-boost-to-uk-life-science-industry\" title=\"\">redefines what it means to be an NHS patient</a>. There is, though, nothing new in using health records for research. For the past 40 years the UK has kept histories of all NHS patients, a feat no other country has achieved, and the resource has proved invaluable.</p> <p>Buried in the nation's health records is information that will save many more lives, and improve quality of life for others. Study of the records can reveal failing health services, rare drug side-effects, and pills that protect against diseases they were never prescribed for. But while some studies using health records go ahead, many never happen because the rules about sharing information are complex and applied haphazardly across the country. The obstacles can make researchers give up.</p> <p>\"The current system can be characterised by inconsistency, confusion and caution,\" said <a href=\"http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/professor-andrew-d-morris\" title=\"\">Prof Andrew Morris, chief scientist to the Scottish government</a>. \"If we want the UK to be the home of world class science, we need to sort these issues out.\"</p> <p>Under the new system anyone who uses the health service will become a research subject by default, their anonymised records being made available for study, unless they opt out. Ministers will rewrite the NHS constitution to presume patient consent.</p> <p>Advocates see a virtuous circle, with greater scrutiny of health records driving up quality of healthcare. But some critics argue that the collective good comes at a price to individual privacy, even when health records are shared anonymously.</p> <p>A consultation on changing the NHS constitution will run through the autumn, alongside a <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/02/dame-fiona-caldicott-to-lead-confidentiality-review/\" title=\"\">review of patient record confidentiality led by Dame Fiona Caldicott</a>. \"The CPRD has the potential to revolutionise research, make a real difference for patients, and allow us to become world leaders in the field,\" said <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/category/chief-professional-officers/chief-medical-officer/\" title=\"\">Dame Sally Davies</a>, the chief medical officer and chief scientist at the Department of Health. What she described as the largest and most ambitious scheme of its kind would allow researchers access to data on an unprecedented level.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/black.nick\" title=\"\">Nick Black</a>, professor of health services research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says there is an ethical imperative to use NHS records, which are gathered and maintained at taxpayers' expense. \"It's irresponsible and misguided not to maximise the use of these data, subject to appropriate confidentiality. These databases are dreadfully under-exploited and the public could benefit enormously if they were used more. It's an incredibly cost-effective way of doing research, and knowing what the quality of care is within the NHS,\" he said.</p> <p>Under the scheme scientists who want to study information held in patient records must first ask their local ethics committee, then send their research plan to the <a href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)</a>, which runs CPRD. If the study is approved by an independent scientific advisory committee the service links the required records electronically, performs the scientists' search, and pulls out the results anonymously.</p> <p>The first of two trials is underway. One study is comparing the long-term use of two drugs, simvastatin and atrovastatin, taken for high cholesterol. Unlike a clinical trial, the study will tests the drugs in the real world, where patients might be on more than one medicine and be less than consistent over taking their pills. The other study hopes to tease out whether antibiotics benefit people who suffer acute flare-ups of obstructive airway disease. Over the next three to four years the MHRA expects to run 500 to 600 studies annually through CPRD.</p> <p>Alf Game, the acting science director at the <a href=\"http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</a>, said the system has uses far beyond medical research. \"It is not just about medicine. Anonymised data sets of basic health and medical information about the population will be absolutely invaluable in increasing our understanding of successful ageing,\" he said. \"This kind of data would provide the whole picture, about absence of disease as well as the presence of it.\"</p> <p>While the majority of research will use only anonymised data, some studies will need information that can potentially identify patients, such as dates of birth and postcodes. These projects can only go ahead if patients give explicit consent, or when the health secretary grants an exception, for example, to protect people in the event of a large-scale danger to public health.</p> <p>Still, there are theoretical risks to patient privacy. The MHRA says it would, for example, give out only broad geographical information, far less precise than the first two letters of a postcode. But any health record that includes a handful of key episodes in a patient's life potentially puts their confidentiality at risk. A study of men over 60 in Scotland who had a detached retina in 1967 and retinal tears in 2009 might reveal other health details of the former prime minister, Gordon Brown.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/\" title=\"\">Ross Anderson</a>, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has used the Freedom of Information Act to try to force the MHRA to reveal how it plans to keep patient data secure, but received only <a href=\"http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/privacy_mechanisms_in_cprd\" title=\"\">partial answers</a>. He says that until the agency fully discloses its methods \u2013 a move he says will allow them to be scrutinised and tested \u2013 their privacy claims amount to \"smoke and mirrors\".</p> <p>\"The fundamental problem is this: If your GP record is sent to the MHRA, then even if they strip off all the personal ID and give you a random number, then somebody who knows about some episodes in your past, such as an appendix operation, or knee surgery, can zoom in on you. You cannot give out longitudinal records except with quite extraordinary amounts of care,\" Anderson said.</p> <p>On privacy, Davies said: \"Protecting the confidentiality of patients remains a priority, so all data is anonymised and people can opt out.\"</p> <p>How real the risk is hard to know. Only accredited scientists can use CPRD. They must specify and justify the information they need, and have a legal agreement with the MHRA to act responsibly. Data is anonymised and encrypted before it is sent, and no researcher can put CPRD data on a computer without it first having a certificate from the agency. The data can only be accessed by named researchers who have passwords and remote security access keys that generate a new code every 30 seconds. If foul play is suspected, researchers can be audited and whole institutions barred if bad behaviour is uncovered.</p> <p>Black said fears over privacy should not trump the \"huge collective benefit\" that sharing patient records brings. \"There has yet to be a single incident of anybody being harmed through the use of any healthcare databases. That's not to say there isn't somebody out there who is aggrieved because they somehow feel their personal information was used in a way they are not happy about. But this argument that terrible things might happen would be a lot stronger if people could come up with examples where somebody has suffered,\" he said.</p> <p>Though sold to the public as a means to improve healthcare, there is more to CPRD than that. The government wants to make money from Britain's NHS records by charging for access to the data. Within four years the system is expected to turn a profit, recouping the \u00a360m set-up costs in seven years.</p> <p>The MHRA will charge industry double the academic rate, with private companies paying about \u00a350,000 to \u00a3100,000 a study, depending on how much record linking needs to be done. The system can only be used for medical research, so drug companies cannot use CPRD for marketing, for example, by tracking down GP surgeries that are not prescribing their medicines. All projects that draw on CPRD data must be made public, usually through published journals.</p> <p>At the heart of the government's plan is a desire to entice global pharma back to Britain, particularly to conduct lucrative, large-scale randomised clinical trials, which can involve thousands of volunteers and attract fees of more than \u00a38,000 a participant. In recent years the UK has haemorrhaged such trials to countries where they are simpler, faster and cheaper to run. In Britain recruitment to trials can be frustratingly slow, because patients often need to give consent twice before they can enrol in a trial: once so their records can be checked to see if they are eligible, and again to invite them to take part. This \"consent for consent\" problem may be solved by another change to the NHS constitution to assume people are happy to be approached unless they opt out.</p> <p>Other systems will run alongside CPRD. This month a group of 10 UK funders, led by the Medical Research Council, <a href=\"http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC008799\" title=\"\">announced four new centres</a>, in London, Manchester, Dundee and Swansea, which will carry out research on linked clinical, social and research data, to investigate treatments and drug safety around diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and child and maternal health.</p> <p>Sir Mark Walport, the director of the Wellcome Trust, who in June was <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2012/WTVM055785.htm\" title=\"\">named as the government's next chief scientist</a>, is one of the most vocal supporters of research on NHS medical records. \"We can only have the best healthcare if we advance medicine through research, and part of that is about measuring the quality of healthcare, in other words knowing how well the NHS delivers,\" he said.</p> <p>Walport described the consent for consent situation as ridiculous. \"Most people would think that when there was research that was relevant to them, there would be a mechanism to approach them to take part. The question is then who makes the approach, and that has to be handled sensitively and securely,\" he said.</p> <p>Dr Janet Valentine, the head of public health and ageing at the <a href=\"http://www.mrc.ac.uk/index.htm\" title=\"\">Medical Research Council</a>, said no other country had such a large and rich source of data on the health of its people as the UK.</p> <p>\"While research using patient data has been carried out for some time, the advent of electronic health records is enabling a step change in the type and sheer scale of research possible, especially when different large health data sets are linked together,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It's like the choice of taking a Kindle on holiday or a couple of books. We are already beginning to identify more effective treatments through the stratification of patients into those who will respond to treatments.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of flights should be moved from Heathrow to London's three other airports as a way of preserving the hub status of Britain's largest airport and avoiding the need for a third runway, Nick Clegg has said.</p> <p>In a Guardian interview, the deputy prime minister insisted that the coalition would stand by its commitment not to build a third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>But Clegg said he accepted the need to preserve Heathrow's status as a hub and that ministers were \"not sticking our heads in the sand\" as business groups warn that Britain is losing business as new routes open up to China from continental European airports.</p> <p>Clegg's intervention comes in the wake of a furious row over plans to expand the capital's flight capacity after the chair of the Commons environment committee, Tim Yeo, challenged the prime minister on Tuesdayto perform a U-turn and start plans for a third runway at Heathrow, asking him whether he would be a \"man or a mouse\" about the decision.</p> <p>Both the transport secretary, Justine Greening, and Number 10 subsequently ruled the idea out but now Clegg has suggested an alternative.</p> <p>Clegg said: \"Our position in the coalition is really clear. It is written in the coalition agreement. We are not going to give the go-ahead to a third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>\"But of course I accept, everybody accepts, that the issue of the hub status of Britain's airport capacity is a really important one for our economy. We are an open economy, we are a trading economy.</p> <p>\"When people say we are losing out on new routes to new parts of Asia and China and Latin America of course that is something you take seriously.</p> <p>\"But we are kind of lurching from instant solution to another. One moment it is Boris Island, now it is a third runway. No doubt people will be saying we should rebuild Stansted from scratch.</p> <p>\"There are people attached to Heathwick. There are lots of ideas. What we need to do as a government is sensibly say we are going to stick to our coalition agreement but we are not sticking our heads in the sand. We recognise it is an issue.\"</p> <p>The deputy prime minister said he personally favoured freeing up capacity from Heathrow, which is over-used, by moving hundreds of flights to three other airports around London: Luton, Stansted and Gatwick.</p> <p>\"I personally think if you look at the way in which capacity is distributed across London's four airports there is something in the short to medium term we should be doing to try to re-jig that capacity so that Heathrow plays its role as the de facto hub airport.</p> <p>\"At the moment you have one airport, Heathrow, that is bursting to capacity and three others \u2013 Gatwick, Stansted and Luton \u2013 which are under capacity.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of flights going into Heathrow that aren't necessary for its hub status. If you are being logical about this you would shift a lot of the current flights out of Heathrow to the other three airports, freeing up that hub capacity for Heathrow.</p> <p>\"You could do that and then have a longer term debate about how you deal with hub capacity over the coming decades.\"</p>",

  "<p>Security contractor G4S is targeting developing markets in the hope they will take a more forgiving view of its bungled Olympics security contract than British politicians did, after it emerged the fiasco has cost the group \u00a350m.</p> <p>Nick Buckles, G4S chief executive, said the business would push on with plans to expand developing country contracts from 31% of revenues to 50% by the end of the decade, with Brazil, China and India the main priorities.</p> <p>He spoke as G4S confirmed it had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/27/g4s-nick-buckles-olympic\" title=\"\">taken a hit of \u00a350m on the Olympics</a>, at the top end of expectations, along with a 60% fall in first-half profits.</p> <p>\"I am confident that this will not have an impact on developing markets. As long as we continue to do a good job in the Paralympics, over time I think generally it will not have an impact,\" he said. G4S said it expected the Paralympics to run smoothly with no staffing shortfalls.</p> <p>\"We are confident that we have an assured security workforce for the Paralympic Games and do not anticipate any workforce shortfall issues to arise,\" the group said.</p> <p>Buckles said he was \"deeply disappointed\" with the London 2012 debacle, when the army was called in to shore up security after G4S was able to provide only 7,800 of the required 10,400 guards.</p> <p>The G4S figures for the six months to 30 June confirmed that the impact of the Games contract \u2013 which includes paying for the deployment of soldiers \u2013 will be at the upper end of an initial \u00a335m-\u00a350m&#xa0;estimate.</p> <p>Extra costs included laundry contracts signed by the Ministry of Defence so that uniforms worn on public duty were cleaned and ironed.</p> <p>G4S reported pre-tax profits of \u00a361m for the first half, down from \u00a3151m in the first six months of 2011. The profit drop was largely accounted for by the \u00a350m Olympics loss and \u00a324m in restructuring costs, which includes cutting 1,110 jobs from the group's 657,000-strong global workforce, with the majority of cuts occurring outside the UK.</p> <p>Buckles said he hoped to keep his job, adding: \"I have been with the company for 28 years, 10 of them as chief executive.\"</p> <p>A review of the Olympic contract furore, by auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, will help determine Buckles's future and is expected to report to the group board in the second half of September.</p> <p>Buckles said his appearance before the home affairs select committee shortly before the Games, where he was forced to admit that the Olympics process had been a \"shambles\", was difficult but necessary. One of G4S's major investors criticised the tone of the hearing, likening it to a medieval persecution. Buckles is scheduled to make another appearance this month.</p> <p>\"The home affairs process is a legitimate process. It was a difficult process for me personally,\" he said.</p> <p>Buckles denied that the furore had dented G4S's chances of securing more UK government contracts \u2013 thought to be a factor in whether he retains the CEO post \u2013 although he admitted the group had passed on a Department for Work and Pensions contract worth \u00a320m a year while it scrambled to get the Olympics situation under control.</p> <p>\"We have got a very strong track record [in the UK] and we believe that will stand the company in good stead for future government outsourcing business,\" he said.</p> <p>Three police forces \u2013 in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire \u2013 are considering outsourcing more than 1,000 jobs in IT and human resources to G4S.</p> <p>The firm said it had delivered 83% of the security shifts demanded under the Olympics contract and gave reassurances over the Paralympics, which start on Wednesday.</p> <p>More than half the job cuts revealed by G4S on Tuesday have taken place in developing markets, such as India, Thailand and South Korea, with 58 lost in the UK. G4S provides security work in more than 125 countries in a range of sectors, including courts in England and Wales, the European commission building in Brussels and Baghdad International airport.</p> <p>Louise Cooper, an analyst at brokerage BGC Partners, was sceptical of G4S's ambitions in emerging markets. She said: \"Why would anyone take the risk of awarding a contract to a company known to have failed so spectacularly when there are plenty of other companies offering almost identical services?</p> <p>\"G4S may either lose revenue as contracts are awarded to competitors or have to take a hit to margins as it has to undercut those competitors to win business.\"</p> <p>Buckles said the main benefit of prestige contracts such as the Olympics is to enhance the company's reputation, not to make money. \"Even with the Olympics contract here, we were not expecting to make a huge amount of profit from it. It was a flagship business for us internationally.\"</p> <p>But the uproar over the London contract has dented G4S's foreign ambitions, inciting the group to pull out of bidding for work on the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil and the Rio Olympics in 2016 \u2013 even though Brazil is one of three emerging markets that it is targeting, followed by China and India, where it employs 150,000 people. G4S admitted that it had also decided against bidding for a Department for Work and Pensions contract, worth about \u00a320m a year, due to the fallout from London 2012 problems.</p> <p>Buckles said the withdrawal from the World Cup and Rio Olympic contests would not cause serious harm to the company's developing market ambitions because the Brazilian security market is growing at a double-digit rate and throwing up numerous opportunities. \"The Olympics and World Cup were additional business that we hoped to get,\" he said. With no flagship contracts on the horizon, G4S expects to grow through smaller sized work such as airport security deals.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/10/libya-split-between-militiashttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/10/libya-split-between-militias\" title=\"\">Libya is awash with \"militias\"</a> \u2013 a ubiquitous term applied to the armed groups that formed during the war with Gaddafi and carried out much of the fighting against his regime. The interim government that will soon be chosen by the newly elected assembly will have to deal with the militia question if Libya is to become a state underpinned by the rule of law rather than one dominated by warlord factions.</p> <p>Just how many militias exist is unknown but estimates put the number in the low to mid hundreds. Their ranks are made up of thousands of young men \u2013 with many joining after the war ended \u2013 whose motives are complex and varied (the issue of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19364536\" title=\"\">pro-Gaddafi militias</a> is another matter altogether).</p> <p>Most are no doubt eager to secure a future for themselves and preserve <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/10/26/libya_sexual_revolution\" title=\"\">the respect</a> that now goes along with being a Libyan <em>thuwwar</em> (revolutionary). Others are more interested in the profits that come with controlling the trading routes along Libya's borders and other realms of the economy (militias in the east and west seized various businesses and private property after the uprising was over). It is a struggle that has led to clashes between militia groups.</p> <p>Still, their persistence also reflects a genuine desire to maintain security in their area of origin, something that the National Transitional Council (NTC) \u2013 the interim authority established during the uprising \u2013 was unable to do, partly because it lacked resources but also because it was viewed by western-based militias as being dominated by eastern Libyans and former Gaddafi officials who were mostly spectators during the fighting.</p> <p>At the same time, the militias have committed serious human rights abuses \u2013 including torture \u2013 against individuals and communities suspected of supporting the Gaddafi regime, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17053836\" title=\"\">as Amnesty International has documented</a>.</p> <p>The NTC tried to deal with the problem by bringing the militias under its rule. In September 2011, it created the Supreme Security Committee (SSC), a patchwork of various militia groups thought to number around 100,000. It also attempted to establish control over the Libyan National Shield, a group formed by militias from the east, Zintan and Misrata to preserve \"the ideals of the revolution\".</p> <p>In return for maintaining order around the country, the members of both groups were paid a salary that surpassed the average Libyan's wage, thus providing an incentive to continue fighting on the side of the state.</p> <p>The difficulty, however, is that the SSC and the National Shield \u2013 which have now become the assembly's problem \u2013 never came under the NTC's control and instead operated independently.</p> <p>In fact, their large numbers also threaten to overwhelm Libya's very weak military and police forces, both of which lack supplies and manpower. This would be less of a concern if they conducted themselves lawfully. But they haven't. Both have used violence to further their aims, have carried out random arrests and continue to maintain secret prisons.</p> <p>How to proceed? One possible solution is to strike at the heart of what has allowed the militias to retain their power: weapons.</p> <p>Three-quarters of Libya's arms are under the control of the militias who were able to seize the Gaddafi regime's deposits. While these include heavier items such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, militia fighters also hold many of the handguns, assault rifles and machine guns \u2013 put together, these apparently <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jun/21/libya-cracking/?pagination=false\" title=\"\">total around 20m</a> \u2013 that proliferate in Libya today along with the necessary ammunition. And therein lies the opportunity.</p> <p>The NTC <a href=\"http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/07/15/libya-s-militia-menace/csdq\" title=\"\">mulled the idea</a> of offering to hire militia members to serve in the military or police force and fund job training and even scholarships in exchange for them agreeing to quit their militia. The proposal never came to fruition but will likely be looked at again. Yet, rather than squeezing open government jobs, why not provide incentives that have the potential to create employment outside the state sector?</p> <p>This is what civil society actors in Mozambique did after its civil war ended in 1992. Seeing arms as a threat to peace, a \"<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fas.org%2Fasmp%2Fcampaigns%2Fsmallarms%2FSALWPaper.pdf&amp;ei=dqo8UP7kL8Kj0QWbl4C4AQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYjjK2MHzjKsm_raHcQLZyXnP9BA&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Tools for Arms</a>\" programme was started in the mid-1990s by a coalition of Christian churches.</p> <p>By handing in weapons \u2013 which were destroyed on the spot in order to calm fears over how they might be used \u2013 former fighters were given their choice of goods that had practical value. These included sewing machines, hoes, seeds, bicycles and household goods. In other instances, food was offered rather than tools. Close to 500,000 weapons and munitions were collected in this way over a five-year period.</p> <p>While its results were modest \u2013 Libya has millions of weapons in circulation \u2013 it bears repeating that the programme was run by churches. Indeed, it stands to reason that the Libyan government \u2013 flush with oil profits that continue to pour in \u2013 could organise something more concrete with the help of the international community.</p> <p>True, providing tools won't be enough. For it to produce real results, a weapons exchange programme of the kind described above requires the presence of stable transportation, communication and distribution networks that can sustain an economy \u2013 a particularly difficult challenge in any post-conflict environment.</p> <p>The more important point is that if Libyan leaders are to break the power of the militias and establish a cohesive military and police force that at least has the potential to be above petty interests by upholding a single body of law, then they will have to offer something tangible to those standing in the way.</p>",
  "<h2>New runways</h2> <p>The coalition has officially ruled out new runways at London's three largest airports: Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. Labour, too, is opposed to Heathrow expansion. But business leaders are lobbying hard to relieve the Heathrow bottleneck and the government is under increasing pressure to come up with some major infrastructure projects.</p> <p>The government has now launched a call for evidence and is consulting on the options to relieve this impasse. While the frontbench has ruled out a third runway officially, there have been more emollient noises from David Cameron and George Osborne on new runways in the south-east over the past year. In the past week the housing minister Grant Shapps has called for a third runway to be reconsidered and then the Tory chair of the environment committee, Tim Yeo, demanded on Tuesday that Cameron reverse the decision asking the prime minister: \"Are you a man or a mouse?\" Justine Greening, the transport secretary, is a fierce opponent to expansion and Zac Goldsmith, the environmental campaigner-turned-Tory-MP, has said he would resign as an MP if the party did a Heathrow U-turn.</p> <h2>High Speed Rail</h2> <p>Plans for a \u00a333bn rail route linking London to Leeds and Manchester via Birmingham have cross-party backing but there has been opposition from Conservative backbenchers. The first phase of the route, from London to Birmingham, cuts through Tory heartlands in the Home Counties and has drawn criticism from some local MPs, who query the cost and necessity of a new line.</p> <p>Concerns were raised over the future of the project when a hybrid bill for the London to Birmingham route - giving planning permission for work to begin in 2017 - failed to appear in the Queen's speech this year. However, it is expected next year despite rumblings that Osborne and Cameron might be going cold on the plan. A lack of funds, not an excess of irate home counties MPs, could be the major stumbling block.</p> <h2>West coast main line</h2> <p>The government is set to strip the west coast rail franchise from Virgin Trains and award it to FirstGroup, despite last-ditch lobbying by Sir Richard Branson to reverse the decision. Branson has claimed that FirstGroup's \u00a35.5bn bid for the 14-year contract is unaffordable and will lead to higher fares as well as raising the risk of the franchise collapsing.</p> <p>Aberdeen-based FirstGroup has accused Branson of sour grapes and scaremongering, although more than 100,000 people have signed a petition urging the government to reconsider. Nonetheless, the Department for Transport is set to sign the contract with FirstGroup on Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, the east coast main line London-Edinburgh rail franchise was nationalised by the Labour government in 2009 and has been in state hands ever since. The franchise is due to return to private hands at the end of next year. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, is calling for the east coast line to remain in public ownership.</p>",
  "<p>For ambitious Chinese parents, the opportunity was too good to miss \u2013 even with its 100,000 yuan (\u00a39,950) price tag. Their children would learn to read books in 20 seconds and identify poker cards by touch. The most talented would instantly see answers in their heads when presented with test papers.</p> <p>Around 30 pupils aged from seven to 17 were enrolled for the Shanghai summer course. But 10 days later their \"special abilities\" had not materialised. \"I found that my child learned nothing except how to cheat,\" one parent complained.</p> <p>Experts say the bizarre programme's popularity was simply an extreme example of how families seek to help their children in the intensely competitive education system. Chinese parents have long focused on the college entrance exam, the <em>gaokao</em>. Now families say they are caught in a chain, because good <em>gaokao </em>results depend on getting into a good high school, which, in turn, requires a good primary. Even some nursery schools in big cities have waiting lists and interviews.</p> <p>After-hours classes, weekend tutoring and summer courses are common before middle-class children hit their teens. Few are quite as spectacular as the Shanghai programme, which claimed it achieved remarkable results by training children to use the right-hand side of their brain. A tutor told an undercover reporter from the Oriental Morning Post that pupils learned to detect \"certain waves\" that emanated from everything, including words.</p> <p>Those waves were \"recorded in their brains as pictures\" so that they could read without even looking, she added. Police are now investigating the company behind the course.</p> <p>One angry father told the Guardian the teachers had convinced his daughter she really could read cards by touch. Though his tests proved her wrong, other parents were reluctant to accept the truth, he said. The case underlines the lengths to which parents will go to give their children a competitive edge, or simply help them keep up.</p> <p>Of the wider phenomenon, one Beijing mother, who has paid for extra English and maths lessons since her daughter was six \u2013 a year before she started primary school \u2013 said: \"Every kid is going to after-school classes nowadays. It's not only kids who are not good at school but also top students.\"</p> <p>Ms Wei, who asked that only her surname be used, said her previously carefree daughter was already showing signs of stress. \"But what can we do? If she fails to get into a good high school, her future won't be bright,\" she added. \"Kids have to fight fiercely in order to go to top schools. It's like a real battle with blood and bruises.\"</p> <p>Such anxieties are widespread. Last year research by the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that China was the only country in which most people \u2013 68% in all \u2013 thought parents put too much pressure on students. In contrast, 64% of Americans thought parents applied too little pressure.</p> <p>Children seem to agree. A 2010 study by British and Chinese researchers found that more than a third of the primary school pupils they surveyed in the eastern province of Zhejiang suffered headaches and stomach pains at least once a week.</p> <p>\"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" said the researchers, who were led by Professor Therese Hesketh of the Centre for International Health and Development at University College London.</p> <p>Officials have already tried to curb some excesses. Earlier this year, Chinese media reported that the ministry of education had banned nursery schools from setting homework.</p> <p>But parenting expert Yin Jianli, who urges families to value creativity and independence, said it was also time for fathers and mothers to grow up. She acknowledged that people worried about their sons' and daughters' futures, but added: \"They won't let their children have a proper break during holidays. They know very little about education and child-rearing, but they have a strong sense of being competitive. So they will just follow other parents blindly.\" That was not just tough on the children, but counter-productive, she warned: \"In the short term, kids will feel tired. In the long run, they will lose their interest in studying.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Kathy Gao</em></p>",

  "<p>Tim Yeo, a senior Conservative MP, has scored an absolute blinder by asking the prime minister to prove whether he is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/28/david-cameron-taunted-tory-mp-heathrow\" title=\"\">\"man or a mouse\"</a> on the building of a third runway at Heathrow. By reducing such complex political deliberations to these absurdly simple and mildly offensive terms, Yeo has propelled a dying issue to the front page and had the transport secretary Justine Greening on the back foot all morning as she toured the studios at Millbank, looking flustered to say the least.</p> <p>As a rhetorical tactic, the \"man or mouse\" strategy is fantastic, through hardly new. There is a similarly great line from an ancient Roman satire by Petronius penned almost 2,000 years ago in Nero's day: \"Mufrius, non magister\", which translates roughly as \"You're not a guru, you're a gorilla\". The line has much in common with Yeo's: both are contrasts, both are alliterative, both are metaphorical, both are hyperbolical and both are short and simple. Crucially, both also come straight from the language of the playground.</p> <p>That, to me, is the most important point that emerges from Yeo's rhetorical victory today: that the British people all love playground politics. Though we all claim to aspire to a higher form of political debate, the truth is that nothing is guaranteed to get people talking more than a good old-fashioned taunt. It rouses an ancient primeval instinct that lies deep inside all of us: the same instinct that is roused when we hear the distant sound of \"Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!\" across the playground. Our attention is stolen. We follow the chants. We feel compelled to watch the battle that ensues. We just can't help ourselves.</p> <p>The best politicians know this. Many of the most memorable lines from political history were barely disguised playground taunts: Winston Churchill describing Clem Attlee as a \"sheep in sheep's clothing\"; Denis Healey saying debating with Geoffrey Howe was like being \"savaged by a dead sheep\"; Michael Foot, comparing Norman Tebbit with a \"semi house-trained polecat\". Think about the banter between political leaders in recent years: Blair famously condemning Hague's career with the withering: \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye\"; Hague's comeback at Blair, \"I don't think I would have a reverse gear if I had Peter Mandelson behind me\"; or Vince Cable's immortal observation of the remarkable transformation in Gordon Brown, \"from Stalin to Mr Bean\".</p> <p>We have had equally childish insults over the last year, particularly from Tories to other Tories \u2013 Simon Burns called the speaker a stupid, sanctimonious dwarf, while Nadine Dorries was described as \"Mad Nad\" after she came out and condemned Osborne and Cameron as \"arrogant posh boys\".</p> <p>One of the most famous episodes of the West Wing entitled <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Bartlet_Be_Bartlet\" title=\"\">Let Bartlet be Bartlet</a>, sees chief of staff Leo McGarry appealing to his team: \"We're gonna raise the level of public debate in this country, and let that be our legacy.\"</p> <p>It's extremely rousing and heartwarming stuff, but of course it's absolute twaddle. The truth is that in political debate there is a trade: the more you elevate debate, the more you exclude people from it.</p> <p>I'm no fan of Tim Yeo: I tend to think of him as everything that is worst about the Tory party \u2013 with his highly privileged upbringing, his intertwined business and political interests and his unconventional marital arrangements \u2013 but he has at least brought the debate about Heathrow to the masses and for that we should be grateful. Who knows \u2013 perhaps his own chief of staff made a McGarry-esque appeal behind the scenes: \"Let's have more playground taunts in politics, let's have more puerility in politics, let's have more piss-taking in politics. Let that be our legacy.\" If it led to a greater interest in politics, it wouldn't be a bad legacy. At least it would get people talking.</p>",

  "<p>The glamour is the least of it. Celtic will certainly revel in a return to the Champions League group stage after a four-year absence if, as expected, they polish off the qualifier with Helsingborg on Wednesday. Neil Lennon's side, though, will be doing more than just amassing some prestige from a tie in which the away leg was won 2-0.</p> <p>The relegation of Rangers to the Third Division of the Scottish Football League will have cut income. Although Sky do not comment on the present value of the five-year deal it is being suggested that the sum paid out has dipped from around \u00a316m a season to \u00a313m. There is sure to be a further impact on the Scottish Premier League since the Rangers away support now travels to a different set of grounds.</p> <p>At such a moment, it is wise to remember once again that the term \"Old Firm\" is a scornful reminder that the clubs are business partners as much as rivals. The relationship has been as lucrative as it is claustrophobic and the Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell might pine for absent Rangers, even if it would be impossible for him to say so in public.</p> <p>The damage can be offset to a degree. Celtic are not without assets and their name is resonant enough for them to be paid an estimated \u00a31m for taking part in a friendly with Real Madrid staged in Philadelphia earlier this month. Nonetheless, there are anxieties.</p> <p>Back in the 2000s, Celtic had a lineup that included John Hartson, Chris Sutton and Neil Lennon. That trio cost around \u00a318m in total and while Henrik Larsson was bought for \u00a3650,000, his impact was so great that the personal terms must have been gratifying. He stayed with the club for seven years.</p> <p>That sort of outlay was not sustainable even then. After Celtic had overcome Liverpool at Anfield and gone on to the Uefa Cup final in 2003, where they lost to Porto, the then chairman Brian Quinn had to break bad news to his manager Martin O'Neill. Celtic were in the red that&#xa0;season.</p> <p>The club has a natural craving to be in a more lucrative environment. There is, however, no likelihood of, say, the Premier League being provocative enough to break the structure of domestic football in Europe by extending an invitation to Celtic. The television revenue is already vast without them. Other notions crop up. Celtic were, for instance, attracted to the concept of an Atlantic League that would bind together clubs who all faced similar&#xa0;difficulties.</p> <p>It was intended that sides from Scotland, Holland, Belgium, Portugal, Sweden and Denmark would take part in it. Those close to the discussions understood that Lennart Johansson, the then president of Uefa, might not be implacably opposed to the scheme. The principal trouble was that no country pursued the initiative with complete commitment. A club that was doing well, for instance, would lose interest in the project. The Portuguese were said to be the first to do so.</p> <p>Back in Scotland, Celtic have tried to achieve new status by other means. All sizeable clubs scout globally, but the Scottish champions have to do so with particular intensity. For them, the case of Ki Sung-yueng is a textbook example. He cost Celtic \u00a32m and has recently joined Swansea for around \u00a35m.</p> <p>The South Korea midfielder has talent and learned how to make better use of it during his time in Glasgow. He may well suit Michael Laudrup, but the truth is that Ki was not regarded as being critical to Celtic's plans. The anguish would have been far greater, for instance, if Lennon had parted with Victor Wanyama, an imposing Kenyan midfielder who came from Germinal Beerschot for \u00a31m.</p> <p>Currently, Celtic can feel that they are getting the maximum from the side. The economics dictate that a devastating and established striker would be unaffordable, but the teenager Tony Watt has been showing a ruthless streak. He was bought from Airdrie United for an initial payment of \u00a380,000 and scored twice in his first start for Celtic, a 4-2 win at Inverness Caledonian Thistle.</p> <p>The club is enjoying a little spell of encouragement. While Celtic lack the money to buy the best footballers or even the established players, their approach is effective at present. Lennon has to make the best of his men and Georgios Samaras, who is no predator, often makes his contribution with surging runs from centre to left that often drag opponents away to open up space in the middle.</p> <p>Kris Commons, who came from Derby County for \u00a3300,000, took the opener against Helsingborg in Sweden. If the visitors are brushed aside Celtic will step into the well-stocked bank vault that is the Champions League.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have outsourced more than \u00a33bn of public services to Atos, the multinational IT firm whose sponsorship of the Paralympics has prompted a nationwide campaign by disability activists.</p> <p>A series of parliamentary questions from Labour MP Tom Greatrex reveals the value of contracts with Atos is now more than a third higher than the amount outsourced by the last government. The replies expose how far the reach of the company extends in Whitehall.</p> <p>The revelations come as the company, which conducts controversial medical assessments for benefit claims on behalf of the government, reaps the benefits of its association with the Olympic and Paralympic movement. City analysts estimate that Atos's work for the London Olympic and Paralympic Games is worth \u00a3200m in revenues. They say its sponsorship of the events helps showcase \"its technology and project management capabilities\".</p> <p>On Wednesday disabled protesters will deliver a coffin filled with 85 pages of complaints from people and their families who have been told they have to get a job despite suffering from serious impairments. They point out that 1,100 people died last year after failing the test for the new incapacity benefit.</p> <p>Linda Burnip, the co-founder of Disabled People Against Cuts, which is leading the campaign, said: \"The fact is that Atos is getting all the credit for the Paralympics and at the same time it is destroying disabled people's lives through the work capability assessments.\"</p> <p>Greatrex has secured a Westminster Hall debate on Atos and the work capability assessments on 4 September.</p> <p>While 10 government departments have contracts with the company, its most high-profile deal sprang from a Labour pilot project in 2008 to decide whether people were fit to work or eligible for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). This contract \u2013 worth \u00a3112m last year \u2013 has been extended across the country by the coalition government and been the focus of campaigners' ire.</p> <p>The company has conducted about 738,000 work capability assessments on benefit claimants in the past financial year. However the assessments have been widely criticised and it has emerged that 40% of people appeal against the decisions \u2013 with 38% of those successful. The cost to the taxpayer of the tribunal system alone is \u00a350m, around half of the amount spent on reassessment.</p> <p>Charities say jobcentre staff have been shocked \"when someone who is clearly unwell turns up having been told that they are fit for work\". In May <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/23/gps-work-capability-assessment-scrapped\" title=\"GPs call for work capability assessment to be scrapped\">GPs called for the assessments to be scrapped</a>. Greatrex, whose investigation into Atos led to the National Audit Office this month calling for an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/17/nao-criticises-atos-benefits-contract\" title=\"GuardianSociety: NAO criticises Atos benefits contract\">overhaul of the government's medical testing contract</a> with the company, said the firm \"would not fix its reputation by sponsoring the Paralympics\".</p> <p>\"Despite the huge concerns that have been raised about the way in which the work capability assessment is delivered by Atos, it seems the Tory-led government is happy to increase the value of its contracts with the firm,\" he said. \"Ministers appear to be either unconcerned or unaware of the problems with Atos \u2013 both of which reflect badly on the very people who should be doing their job in getting better value for money for the taxpayer, and a fairer assessment for those who have to go through it.\"</p> <p>Disabled activists who have campaigned against the medical assessments say they are astonished to learn that this contract is the tip of the iceberg. Atos won three contracts from the Department for International Development worth \u00a3270m, including \u00a320m to run a federal public administration reform programme in Nigeria. It also won a \u00a333m contract to run IT for the Highways Agency and ran computers for the Home Office in an arrangement which cost the taxpayer \u00a362m last year.</p> <p>Ministers have been impressed with Atos's performance \u2013 the company was the first IT firm to sign a new \"memorandum of understanding\" after the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, redesigned Labour contracts he considered too favourable to the private sector. In a vote of confidence in the company this month, Atos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/02/atos-disability-benefit-tests\" title=\"\">won government contracts worth \u00a3400m</a> to test whether disabled people should continue receiving disability living allowance benefits. The Cabinet Office said all contracts were \"based on the best value for money for taxpayers and are subject to strict scrutiny\".</p> <p>The disability campaigners are being backed by UK Uncut, which hopes its tactics of peaceful occupation and canny use of social media will galvanise the wider public in action. Tony Smith, spokesperson for UK Uncut, said: \"Atos are doing the government's dirty work, taking away benefits from disabled people without regard for their needs, leaving many in poverty and driving some to suicide. They are being paid millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to rip apart our welfare system.\"</p> <p>Analysts said the company had become a whipping boy because of the tests. Rachael Stormonth, of NelsonHall analysts, said Atos had inherited the assessments when it bought a company that used to test coal miners for emphysema. \"Both the amount of time Atos gets and the quality of the assessment is up to the government. They are the whipping boys here,\" said Stormonth.</p> <p>An Atos spokesperson said: \"We are proud of our association with the Paralympic Games and have provided technology and support since 2002 to help ensure their success.</p> <p>\"We run a number of contracts in the UK, both in the private sector and within government, and offer our customers good value for money alongside high standards of service, delivery and flexibility. In particular, Atos has been providing medical assessments to government for 13 years.\"</p> <p>A government spokesperson said sponsorship was a matter for Games organisers, saying: \"Locog and the International Paralympic Committee make all decisions on sponsorship for the Paralympics. All the partners provide vital funding without which the Games would not happen and they operate within the supplier guidelines.\"</p> <p>\"It's disappointing that a small number of organisations are protesting against sponsorship of the Paralympic Games, which is an opportunity to showcase the talents of disabled people and act as a catalyst for our sporting talents of the future.\"</p>",
  "<p>Some economists believe that this summer could mark the moment when some of the eurozone's peripheral members may begin to be forced out; others think that such a scenario is inconceivable. All agree that, at least in the short term, a eurozone breakup would be disastrous for jobs and growth.</p> <p>But, because the outcome is unknowable, and depends on politics as much as on economics, let us leave that frightening prospect to one side and look instead at what we know about the underlying performance of the European Union economy. In short, how competitive is Europe in the summer of 2012?</p> <p>If we compare the EU-15 (the membership before the enlargements of 2004 and 2007) with the US, the most obvious point is that GDP per capita in Europe is almost 25% lower, a difference of around $11,000 a year. Furthermore, per capita EU productivity, which had been converging on the US level for 20 years up to 1995, when Europe was only about 5% below the US, lost 10 percentage points in relative terms in the decade preceding the eurozone crisis. Europe was unable to match America's significant productivity boost from the information technology revolution.</p> <p>But Europe managed to hold its share of global exports during that period more effectively than did the US. European companies have been more successful, on average, at maintaining their share of emerging-market demand than have US companies.</p> <p>Moreover, European job creation has not been as bad as many think. An analysis by McKinsey &amp; Company of new jobs in the US and the EU from 1995 to 2008 suggests that, while the US created 20m new jobs, 19m of them were attributable to population growth. The EU-15 created about 24m new jobs during the same period, with only 9m due to rising population.</p> <p>This job creation was not evenly spread across Europe, but it happened. That means that the EU now has successful employment models that can be emulated.</p> <p>There is also solid evidence that Europe's big companies have been competing relatively well globally. The number of Fortune 500 companies with headquarters in the EU has grown over the last decade, while the number of those based in the US has fallen. Moreover, big European companies' profits have grown 50% more rapidly than those of their American counterparts.</p> <p>Few deny the need for fiscal consolidation in many EU countries, especially in the south (and including France). But fiscal adjustment must be accompanied by structural reform. It is clear that the labour-market reforms undertaken by Germany a decade ago, painful as they were, have put the German economy in a far stronger position to compete globally. Similar reforms are urgently needed in countries like Italy and Spain.</p> <p>Service sector reform is vital as well. Manufacturing productivity per hour in Europe compares quite well with the US, but Europeans work significantly fewer hours per year, which explains the annual per capita difference. But European countries lag badly in services, where restrictive practices, protectionism, and inefficiency hold them back.</p> <p>The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, and his Italian counterpart, Mario Monti, seem to understand these points, but the reform programmes that they have unveiled are not adequate to the challenge. Although Italian employers have dismissed the proposed employment law reform as far too modest, Monti's government has retreated in the face of trade union opposition and protests from assorted interest groups (like taxi drivers) eager to defend their privileges.</p> <p>Governments are inhibited by the knowledge that labour market reform may well result in a short-term increase in unemployment (and thus further fiscal deterioration), because employers will find it cheaper to fire personnel. The hope is that greater flexibility would also translate into a greater willingness to hire in an economic upturn.</p> <p>For EU politicians, however, the long term will be reached only after a series of short-term electoral challenges, so pro-reform governments may well not survive to reap the benefits. As Luxembourg's prime minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, remarked, all EU governments know what must be done; what they don't know is how to get re-elected once they have done it.</p> <p>Is there a way out of this dilemma?</p> <p>Countries such as Germany are adamantly opposed to a fiscal union, with a central EU budget for responding to asymmetric shocks, because they would be the chief contributors. But a variant that might elicit greater support would link fiscal support to labour market reform. If Italy or Spain introduced changes that led to a short-term increase in joblessness, the fiscal costs would be met from a central EU budget to ease the pain. This \"investment\" by wealthier countries should pay off if it leads to more flexible labour markets and higher productivity in the recipient countries.</p> <p>Another proposal is a central budget subsidy to reduce employment taxes in the EU's most economically challenged countries. The logic is that a country like Greece needs devaluation to enhance its competitiveness, but that leaving the euro would pose major problems. The alternative would be to cut nominal wages (\"internal\" devaluation), which is hard to do (though it has been achieved in Latvia and Ireland).</p> <p>Reducing taxes on labour, perhaps for a defined period, would have a similar effect. That would be costly for governments in the short term, though an increase in output and employment might well justify the \"tax expenditure\" involved; here, too, an EU subsidy might be a worthwhile investment.</p> <p>If Europe wants to revive sustainable growth and high employment, it must replicate what has worked in those countries that have performed successfully. Doing so will cost money. Governments must be prepared to persuade their electorates that it would be money well spent.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday at World Water Week I attended a session on the <a href=\"http://ceowatermandate.org/\" title=\"\">CEO Water Mandate</a>, the UN initiative that brings together leading global companies to aid in the development, implementation and disclosure of water sustainability policies and practices.</p> <p>The first thing apparent from the companies sat around the table was that the agenda has really moved on. Long gone is the talk of what corporates ought to be doing. Instead, questions revolve around how best to achieve it.</p> <p>Here are a couple of key themes from the session:</p> <p><strong>Where does corporate responsibility start and end?</strong></p> <p>Some companies are now involved in the provision of clean water to their local communities. Is this going too far? Is it a company's responsibility to provide water for domestic use in the vicinity of its operations? Well, the jury is still out. There is a risk that doing this extends the expectations of local communities to potentially beyond what is reasonable or sustainable but, as with all water issues, it has to be considered in the local context.</p> <p>Often the urge to step in comes from the local government failing to provide a clean and secure water source for the local community. There was a good deal of discussion around how companies relate to government, particularly local government. While in the short-term jumping in to make an immediate impact feels right, the consensus view is that trying to take a longer-term view is best, where a real partnership and sense of shared responsibility is forged.</p> <p><strong>The importance of being local</strong></p> <p>It's fair to say that a number of companies have already made real progress in understanding water risk and its impact on the bottom line. The step forward that we're witnessing now is an increasing awareness of water risk at the local level.</p> <p>With water, a single company or even single country approach doesn't work. There isn't a single water risk per company and each is different and unique depending on the specific watershed and local factors. Tackling water at this level is more difficult and more complex but the group was clear that it's the right thing to do.</p> <p><strong>Don't go it alone</strong></p> <p>Because water is so multifaceted, it's too large an issue for one company or even one sector to tackle alone. The issues are often too long-term and, paradoxically, often too immediate for a single player to address on their own. There was a definite feeling around the table that partnership and collaboration is the right path, but questions do remain about how to structure that relationship. Here, again, the answer isn't straightforward. In certain circumstances partnerships need to be formalised with specific roles, responsibilities and funding. But sometimes a less formal approach will work. In South Africa there is a <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/news/water-partnership-south-africa-launched-world-economic-forum-africa\">Strategic Water Partnership Network</a> which allows companies and the public sector to informally engage on key issues where respective capabilities can improve the water situation on the ground. Be it formal or more informal, I predict a new era of greater corporate collaboration on water security.</p> <p><em>Andre Fourie is head of Sustainable Development at SAB, the South African subsidiary of SABMiller</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Australian and European carbon markets will be linked in 2015, creating the world's biggest emissions trading market.</p> <p>Under the deal struck by Canberra and the European commission, Australian liable entities will be able to buy up to 50% of their carbon permits in Europe from 2015. In 2018, European entities will also be able to purchase credits from Australia.</p> <p>\"Linking the Australian and EU systems reaffirms that carbon markets are the prime vehicle for tackling climate change and the most efficient means of achieving missions reduction,\" said Greg Combet, Australia minister for climate change and energy efficiency.</p> <p>\"It means the EU price will drive the Australian price and that will effectively be the floor price in our system too,\" he said.</p> <p>The European commisioner for climate action, Connie Hedegaard, welcomed the announcement.</p> <p>\"We now look forward to the first full international linking of emission trading systems. This would be a significant achievement for both Europe and Australia,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It is further evidence of strong international co-operation on climate change and will build further momentum towards establishing a robust international carbon market.\"</p> <p>In Australia, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, Nathian Fabian, said the link between the two markets would please investors.</p> <p>\"We think investors will be pleased about the greater predictability this arrangement will give in the longer term for carbon pricing arrangements and of course, linking with a larger, more liquid market which is more established is also good for investor confidence,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Having schemes that are open and linked is the best way to ensure investors can find the lowest cost and the most carbon competitive businesses to invest in,\" said Fabian.</p> <p>Australia's carbon price, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/29/australia-carbon-tax\" title=\"\">controversially began in July</a> as a fixed $AUD23/tonne tax, will move to an emissions trading scheme in 2015. Originally, the scheme was designed with a $AUD15/tonne floor price (to take effect from 2015), a design feature intended to prevent the price crashing during the early years of trading.</p> <p>It was criticised by businesses because it was significantly higher than (current) international prices (in Europe the price is \u20ac8 or $AUS10/tonne). This meant Australian businesses would have to go through a complex set of adjustments to top up any international permits bought at a price below the Australian floor price.</p> <p>\"The removal of the floor price gives companies the chance to hedge their portfolios with European or international units and bank them in 2015,\" said Elisa de Wit, head of law firm Norton Rose's climate change practice.</p> <p>\"If you have the expectation that the prices will go up, it's a great opportunity to lock yourself in now,\" she said.</p> <p>But Frank Jotzo, director of the Centre for Climate Economics and Policy at the Australian National University, says linking with the EU trading scheme also has risks.</p> <p>\"From an Australian point of view, the EU is in quite some economic turmoil and it is somewhat difficult to judge what policy changes may be around the corner,\" he said.</p> <p>Jotzo says there's an expectation that the combined market price in a linked Australian-EU scheme is likely to be much more strongly influenced by decisions in Brussels and Berlin, than in Canberra.</p> <p>\"If the EU crisis was to deepen and there was a decision to go easy on climate change and let the EU trading price drop lower than it is already, that would be entirely incompatible with Australia's circumstances where greenhouse gas emissions continue to be on a strongly rising trajectory because of the continued expansion of the resources sector and commodity exports to China,\" he said.</p> <p>Australia is the world's biggest exporter of coal and iron ore. Australians also generate more carbon pollution per head than any other developed country, largely because of their heavy reliance on coal-fired power stations to generate electricity. With a population of 22 million, the country is responsible for 1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Britain, by comparison, with nearly three times the population, is responsible for just 1.7%.</p>",
  "<p>A jobs drought, a new academic year in which university fees will be more expensive than ever before, and the first year-on-year decrease in upper A-level grades in memory. On the face of it, the situation for school leavers in Britain today seems particularly grim.</p> <p>But I'm an optimist \u2013 I wouldn't have started a company in a recession, or had the conviction to keep it going in the early, scary days, if I wasn't. And because of that, I believe that what seems like a time of shrinking horizons and prospects for the young could also be one of opportunity. And that it should be.</p> <p>When the system is stuttering and the comforts and options people recently took for granted suddenly feel endangered or outdated, caution and conservatism get the upper hand. Understandably but disastrously, firms and policies are often ruled by fear, while individuals can be less eager to give young blood a chance, being focused on preserving their own position.</p> <p>But times like this are about change, which is why they should also be about new opportunities. People are open to new ideas when the old ones are plainly malfunctioning. We're more likely than usual to question our bad habits and inherited assumptions when circumstances shake us out of our comfort zone. When the preordained social and education destinies our young people anticipated are denied them, it should be an opportunity to remember what we too often forget: under-21s are not just prospective employees or students, they are entrepreneurs too. But booming business cultures in emerging economies seem to be much better at celebrating and encouraging youthful energy and innovation than the establishment.</p> <p>Sir Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg: it goes without saying that all are unique and prodigiously clever, but the shared virtue of their youth had plenty to do with their successes too. Not long out of their teens, but before they're fully entangled in the obligations of adulthood, people challenge convention and raise questions about the received wisdom of the world. Without a vested interest in maintaining the status quo or anything to lose, more interest in finding their own way than being ruled by others' expectations, young people are freer and better informed than anybody to think about building a better future.</p> <p>One of the things that has most mattered to me in the years of my company <a href=\"http://www.akqa.com/\" title=\"\">AKQA</a>, which I founded at 21, is nurturing the hungry, hopeful spirit we were created in. Of course, every motivational scheme, every brilliant new digital service that youth culture popularised, every Virgin, Apple or Facebook, also took investment, sacrifice and time. We know that funding can be hard to come by, and people are understandably anxious about taking on more debt to chase a dream, but in the digital world, more than ever before, you can start from a small base, low-cost, and deliver a great idea.</p> <p>If your work or ideas are good enough, you can quickly impress and connect to the right people via the digital channels, or you can put a great idea out there on a crowd fundraising site like <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">KickStarter</a> and ask people to share your excitement to make it a reality. There's more scope than ever to see it as a means to a better end than a dead end, and use spare time to practically dedicate yourself to working out what you have that the world needs, and making it happen.</p> <p>Today, as London 2012 amply demonstrated, we cherish and crave hope, excitement and people with the love and drive to realise their dreams. People who embody those virtues reconnect us with our own deepest feelings and desires.</p> <p>One thing digital will never change is the fact that entrepreneurialism demands genuine enthusiasm, belief, practices, a willingness to contribute. It's also about encouraging our communities to amplify strengths and have faith in their insights.</p> <p><em>Ajaz Ahmed is founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.akqa.com/\" title=\"\"><em>AKQA</em></a><em> and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Velocity-Seven-Laws-World-Digital/dp/0091947561/\" title=\"\"><em>Velocity: Seven New Laws For a World Gone Digital</em></a><em> with Stefan Olander, Nike's vice president of digital sport.

  "<p>As an old adage goes: \"when confronted with two alternatives, always choose the third\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-takes-aim-us\" title=\"\">(Assange urges US to end 'witch-hunt', 24 August)</a>. One solution that so far seems to have been overlooked by governments and the media in the impasse on WikiLeaks's Julian Assange since Ecuador granted him asylum is for the UK government to allow his safe passage from Ecuador's embassy in London to Ecuador's embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. This would meet all parties' obligations under both domestic and international law. The UK could meet its obligations to transfer Assange to face the criminal investigation in Sweden. Sweden could have the opportunity to pursue its investigations in Sweden. Ecuador could maintain international law obligations to protect Assange from extradition to the US to face unfair trial on espionage charges and a potential death penalty. And Assange himself would have the opportunity to have the alleged criminal charges addressed through the normal legal processes.</p> <p>When solutions exist that meet the obligations of all parties, it seems extraordinary that the UK would risk undermining long-standing diplomatic principles for providing political asylum to dissidents faced with political persecution.<br><strong>Michael Hamel-Green</strong><br>Coburg, Victoria, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 The right of asylum in embassies is one of the most sacred of Latin American traditions. During several years working in Bolivia, I saw this working many times, and there is no doubt that the institution has prevented considerable bloodshed.</p> <p>Here is how it works: a political figure who is threatened by a government goes to ground in an embassy \u2013 any embassy, except those of the imperial powers, Britain and the US \u2013 and after a few days the ambassador takes the person in his own embassy vehicle to the airport and puts him on a plane to the country whose embassy is involved. The person granted asylum thereby resigns from political activity and often lives for years in the country involved.</p> <p>Violations of this tradition are regarded by most Latin Americans as barbarous and uncivilised.<br><strong>Jordan Bishop</strong><br>Ottawa, Canada</p> <p>\u2022 Assange's need for political asylum in the embassy of another country, tantamount to house arrest, is reminiscent of Burma's past house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi.

As good Guardian readers we shake our heads, wag our fingers and write to letters columns on corporate malfeasance, political corruption and rampant economic self-interest. Yet behind our backs most of our fingers are crossed hoping that our own consumerist contribution won't be the last straw that breaks the camel's back.</p> <p>It's not just business-as-usual model for industry, banking and financial sectors that's wrong: it's the life-as-usual expectation of at least 6&#xa0;billion of us.<br><strong>Tor Larsen</strong><br>Sydney, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 I'm gobsmacked by the torsion, the schizoid incongruence between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/07/china-rare-earth-village-pollution\" title=\"\">Hunger for rare earths leaves toxic legacy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/18/wearable-technology-vision-of-future?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Wearable computers?

  "<p>Groundwater aquifers, like personal bank accounts, become insolvent when withdrawals exceed deposits.</p> <p>Unlike bank accounts or water sources such as rivers, most of the world's aquifers don't fluctuate all that much from month to month, or even from year to year. You can think of them more like retirement savings accounts: steady, slow changes are usually the norm.</p> <p>That slow motion makes it easy to read trends. If you see a downward trend in either your retirement account or your local aquifer, you could be headed for serious trouble.</p> <p>More than 2 billion people depend on groundwater for drinking or growing food. Groundwater provides more than a quarter of all the water used in the world, with most of its use attributed to irrigated agriculture. Some countries are much more heavily dependent on groundwater than others. In India and the US, more than 60% of irrigated agriculture relies on it.</p> <p>Groundwater also provides a very important buffer against <a href=\"http://drought.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/drought.html?map=%2Fwww%2Fdrought%2Fweb_pages%2Fdrought.map&amp;program=%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmapserv&amp;root=%2Fwww%2Fdrought2%2F&amp;map_web_imagepath=%2Ftmp%2F&amp;map_web_imageurl=%2Ftmp%2F&amp;map_web_template=%2Fdrought.html\" title=\"\">water shortages caused by droughts</a>. Because aquifer levels are considerably less susceptible to short-term climate fluctuations than surface waters such as rivers and lakes, groundwater can be used as a reserve when other water supplies are running short, much like taking out a short-term loan against your retirement fund.</p> <p>The good news is that our ability to detect groundwater trends has increased remarkably in recent years. The bad news coming in from <a href=\"http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2012/world/satellite-perspectives-nasas-grace-program-sees-groundwater-from-space/\" title=\"\">satellite observations</a> and <a href=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/08/13/our-oversized-groundwater-footprint/\" title=\"\">computer models</a> is that the levels of many of the world's most important aquifers are dropping precipitously. Recently, studies have shown that 20% of irrigated agriculture, which produces 40% of our food, is reliant upon aquifers with falling water levels. We are increasingly living on borrowed water, with no repayment plan.</p> <p>It takes a lot of pumping to lower the groundwater level in the world's larger aquifers, simply because they are so massive in volume. The Ogallala aquifer of the American mid-west stores as much water as Lake Huron in the Great Lakes chain, enough to cover the lower 48 states with more than a half a metre of water. The Nubian sandstone aquifer of northern Africa holds more than six times the water of the entire Great Lakes system \u2013 more than all the available freshwater on the surface of our planet.</p> <p>Yet we have gained the technological capacity to drain them. Water levels in the Ogallala have dropped by more than 50 metres in some wells. While that equates to depletion of only 10% of the total volume, with groundwater it's the depth of water that matters, not how much water is left. That's because it takes an extraordinary amount of electricity to lift water as it gets deeper and deeper. As the water in a well drops from 10 to 100 metres in depth, electricity costs can easily increase by 10 times or more, making it economically infeasible to pump any more. That reality is driving thousands of farmers out of business every year.</p> <p>Electricity is the ultimate regulator on overdrafts at the water bank. It's like paying compounding interest on borrowed money: with every year, the debt becomes greater and operation costs soar ever higher.</p> <p>Five years ago, realising the madness of subsidising the burning of oil to pump groundwater from ever-deeper levels, Saudi Arabia abandoned its dream of wheat self-sufficiency. Wheat farming was consuming a third of all water used in the country, and virtually all of that water was coming from declining fossil (non-renewable) aquifers. The government will now import its wheat, leaving the remaining groundwater for its cities and industries.</p> <p>Groundwater declines have been deadly for poor farmers in India. Millions of Indian farmers have witnessed their hand-dug wells going dry, and they cannot afford to chase the falling water level by digging deeper. More than a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide in the last 15 years. The rising cost of farm inputs such as electricity and the inability to irrigate their crops are among the leading causes.</p> <p>The Indian government has tried to stave off water and food shortages by subsidising electricity costs. But across much of India that has only accelerated the rate of groundwater depletion.</p> <p>Ultimately, the only way to stabilise our groundwater accounts is to stop withdrawals from outpacing the natural recharge of water.</p> <p>You would think that sustainably managing and regulating our use of the planet's most precious resource would be a very high priority for our governments. But to date governments have proven miserably incapable of accomplishing such regulation. I have been paying close attention to global water issues for nearly 30 years now, and I still cannot point to a single country that has effectively stabilised its water accounts.</p> <p>If governments can't or won't do this, who will save us from water bankruptcy?</p> <p>I have come to the sobering but empowering conclusion that we must save ourselves and not wait for our governments to help us. We must learn, or in some cases, relearn, the art and culture of sharing water in our local watersheds and communities.</p> <p>In the absence of strong governance, some local communities are taking matters into their own hands. For example, a<a href=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/02/07/texas-water-district-acts-to-slow-depletion-of-the-ogallala-aquifer/\" title=\"\"> community of farmers using the Ogallala aquifer</a> in north-west Texas recently voted to place voluntary limits on their groundwater use as a means to arrest aquifer declines.</p> <p>The practice of water sharing has some long lineages. We might look to the <a href=\"http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/water-solutions/ancient-traditions-keep-desert-waters-flowing\" title=\"\">acequia culture</a> that has evolved over the past 10,000 years, with roots in the Middle East that were spread into southern Spain by the Moors, and then by the Spanish into the American south-west. This communal system of water sharing and irrigating was a response to the scarcity of water in arid regions, and has been key to the survival of agricultural communities where it is practiced.</p> <p>Advances in technology can certainly help. <a href=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/05/07/saving-a-river-one-farm-at-a-time/\" title=\"\">Farmers in the Flint river basin</a> in the state of Georgia in the US are pushing the frontiers of irrigation efficiency, both to save on electricity costs as well as to sustain their community and a river they love.</p> <p>Paul McCartney once wrote that \" \u2026 in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.\"</p> <p>The same can be said for water.</p> <p><em>Brian Richter is director of global freshwater strategies at </em><a href=\"http://www.nature.org/\" title=\"\"><em>The Nature Conservancy</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>When I look south through my kitchen window I can often see a big jet flying up the Thames valley to Heathrow airport eight miles away. In clear blue sky the jets look lovely. But if I open the back door I can also hear them.</p> <p>Today I can also faintly hear <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9502284/Heathrow-expansion-Cameron-must-decide-whether-he-is-man-or-mouse.html\" title=\"\">David Cameron getting a raspberry</a> from the proverbial \"senior Tory backbencher\" over the need to admit he was wrong about yet another coalition policy decision: airports. The language deployed is a bit fruity: are you a mouse or (wo)man, a feeble Harold Macmillan presiding over decay, or a bold Thatcher? asks Tim Yeo.</p> <p>It serves as yet another reminder that almost halfway through the 2010-15 parliament, with no sign of economic recovery, Tory MPs are starting to worry about the economic strategy most of them enthusiastically endorsed. Despite the imminence of a reshuffle Conservative backbenchers are getting a bit panicky about their seats.</p> <p>They are losing their fear of No 10. And that's dangerous. Just ask John Major what happened to his 1992-97 government after the pound's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/euro/page/0,,793253,00.html\" title=\"\">Black Wednesday</a> exit from the embryonic single currency. Reckless with rage, his right wing, full-of-Thatcherite nostalgics destroyed the regime's residual authority.</p> <p>As a cabinet special adviser Cameron had a ringside seat. But his economic plight is more acute: in part the legacy of Thatcherism as practised by Gordon Brown. So is his political plight, which can also be traced to the more toxic components of the lady's mixed record, and her foolish espousal of increasingly anti-European policies, mostly <em>after</em> she left office in 1990. The result is that Ukip and fourth-party politics threaten to further undermine the fragile Tory hold on power.</p> <p>Today the battleground, both surrogate and real, is airports, where third runway and fourth party collide.</p> <p>I live about a mile north of the serious aircraft noise but the revived debate over the third runway is not an abstract one around here. It would be north of the airport's two existing runways \u2013 and our house would catch a lot more noise.</p> <p>Although the coalition partners supposedly killed off the Heathrow option in 2008-10, business leaders and other pro-growth campaigners have been chipping away at the decision. They claim \u2013 without much tangible evidence \u2013 that the chancellor, George Osborne, (the current focus of the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/27/pressure-on-david-cameron-george-osborne\" title=\"\">\"Sack George\" reshuffle poll</a>) is coming around to their way of thinking as evidence mounts that Britain is losing Asian business \u2013 particularly rich Chinese tourists \u2013 to Schiphol, Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle airports.</p> <p>The economics of hub airports, in which many passengers are merely in transit, are complicated. But there is little doubt that London's three airports (four including the City's mini-airport in Docklands) are insufficient to meet current demand, their reputation for delays, queues and other unpleasantness often being justified.</p> <p>The current excitement is provided by Yeo, to whom routine title inflation doesn't apply. He's 67 and has been MP for South Suffolk since 1983, a middling career which peaked as a junior environment minister under Major \u2013 until he was forced to resign after the usual tabloid love child story in January 1994.</p> <p>An amiable fellow, fond of golf and currently chairman of the Commons environment select committee, he's not the sort of MP I'd expect to join a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9498574/Without-a-third-runway-at-Heathrow-well-be-grounded.html\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph campaign</a> and ask Cameron so publicly whether he's a \"man or mouse\" over the third runway. Shrewd ex-MP <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/08/by-paul-goodman-tim-yeo-chairman-of-the-climate-change-select-committee-once-a-heathrow-third-runway-opponent-but-now-a-he.html\" title=\"\">Paul Goodman agrees</a> on ConservativeHome.</p> <p>Yeo's excuse for changing his mind on Heathrow is that big jets are now quieter and more fuel efficient and the EU is including aviation emissions in its range of pollution caps. \"We could cover the whole of Surrey with runways and not increase emissions by a single kilogram,\" he claims. Note that he offers Surrey, not Suffolk, for the experiment.</p> <p>Perhaps he's making a pre-emptive strike against Boris Island \u2013 the London's mayor's fantasy airport project on the Thames estuary (quite close to Suffolk for stacking purposes). Or maybe it's a diversionary tactic given that Yeo has been taking heat from Tory media \u2013 here's the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2190351/Second-Tory-key-climate-change-role-bid-build-giant-North-Sea-windfarm.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail</a> and the <a href=\"http://order-order.com/tag/sleaze/\" title=\"\">Guido Fawkes blog</a> \u2013 on the apparent conflict of interest between his green duties as an MP and the money (\u00a3140,000 a year?) he makes from green interests.</p> <p>Either way Cameron is unlikely to be more than mildly irritated. Yeo is not a threat, he's a symptom. But so is the transport secretary, Justine Greening, who has popped up on air to sound tough about the third runway.</p> <p>Yet the effect of her <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">interview with James Naughtie</a> on Radio 4's Today programme was unconvincing. She kept talking about the need for bold, strategic decisions to resolve south-east England's airport problem instead of the \"piecemeal approach\" politicians have been forced to adopt for 50 years. (Why has the latter prevailed? Too many vested interests \u2013 not least Tory-voting Nimbys \u2013 and the parsimonious Treasury gang up to gridlock a decision.)</p> <p>As Greening re-invented an old policy wheel about consulting all parties, she sounded rather pleased with herself \u2013 though what she proposed has been going on since well before she was born in 1969.</p> <p>So Naughtie was right to press her on the test question. Given that her Putney constituents hate aircraft noise would she resign if Cameron changed policy? We're not going to change policy because it wouldn't be a full-length runway and so wouldn't solve the problem, Greening replied. But she repeatedly ducked the question, meaning that, if necessary, she would probably sit tight.</p> <p>Greening more or less implied that advocates of the third runway needn't bother contributing to her consultation because the facts haven't changed, a tactless and inaccurate suggestion. But the airport lobby won't take any notice because the coalition now has the appearance of a wobbly regime which can be pushed around.</p> <p>There's nothing wrong with a U-turn if executed with conviction and grace. Thatcher made some lovely ones, fast and forceful, that never damaged her authority. She only fell once she stopped doing them \u2013 and clung to the poll tax.</p> <p>As Cameron and Osborne enter a politically and economically scary autumn, they have more to worry about than transport strategy. Yet it matters because it has come to symbolise the courage and vision to tackle big projects that will make the country a greener, leaner, more civilised and efficient place to live. It can generate jobs and growth \u2013 votes too if ministers make the right call.</p> <p>This week Greening has stood up to Sir Richard Branson's familiar whinge about losing the west coast rail franchise to FirstGroup. Plenty of experts (and travellers) think FirstGroup has overbid and must fail. So she'd better be right about better value for money if Cameron is to win seats in Lancashire next time.</p> <p>As for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/hs2\" title=\"\">HS2 high-speed rail line</a> from London to Birmingham and beyond, it's big, bold and French, but I can't be persuaded of the economic case for such expense. The new line doesn't pass my door as Heathrow's new flight path would pass over it. It pains me to say so, but on economic grounds \u2013 and those of practical politics \u2013 I remain a third-runway man.</p> <p>But Greening's confidence and Cameron's steadfastness may just have taken into account <a href=\"http://www.ukiphillingdon.com/?p=4744\" title=\"\">Ukip's robust attitude towards the third runway</a>. Ukip's leader, Nigel Farage, is proud to be the only British politician who is also a Freeman of the City of London. His \"Hillingdon Monster\" line is more populist than posh, but he's more likely to cause Cameron sleepless nights than Yeo.</p>",
  "<p>An intense focus on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/interactive/2012/aug/28/millennium-development-goals-child-mortality-interactive\" title=\"\">countries with the highest levels of child mortality</a> combined with the availability of cheaper vaccines and medicines can lead to a development breakthrough, according to a senior UN health expert.</p> <p>Dr Mickey Chopra, chief health officer at Unicef, the UN children's agency, said investment now would lead to massive strides in meeting the millennium development goals of reducing maternal deaths by three-quarters (MDG4) and the deaths of children under five by two-thirds (MDG5), both by 2015.</p> <p>\"If we make the kind of investment we need now, which is not huge, we could achieve a 'man on the moon' moment,\" Chopra told the Guardian. \"We have a clearer idea why and where children are dying. Twenty-four countries account for 80% of the deaths. We know where they are dying within those countries. Combined with effective interventions such as vaccines and breastfeeding, we have the potential to reach kids in the most cost-effective manner.\"</p> <p>Since 1990, annual maternal deaths have declined by almost half and the deaths of young children have fallen from 12 million to 7.6 million in 2010. Some of the world's poorest countries have achieved impressive progress in reducing child deaths. Rates of child mortality in many African countries have been dropping twice as fast in recent years as during the 1990s.</p> <p>In Botswana, Egypt, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania, the rate of decline was on average more than 5% a year between 2000 and 2010. Similar progress has been made in reducing maternal deaths, although in fewer developing countries: Equatorial Guinea, Nepal and Vietnam have each cut maternal deaths by 75%.</p> <p>However, many countries \u2013 especially in Africa and south Asia \u2013 are not making progress. According to <a href=\"http://www.countdown2015mnch.org/about-countdown\" title=\"\">Countdown 2015</a>, an umbrella group of academics, donors and NGOs that tracks progress in maternal and child survival, only nine of 74 Countdown countries with available data are on track to achieve MDG5. Eight of them (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Eritrea, Laos, Nepal and Vietnam) are also on track to achieve MDG4.</p> <p>Chopra said countries such as Niger and Nepal had made significant progress on child mortality even without fast economic growth or significant poverty reduction. \"In Niger, child mortality dropped by 47% in 10 years,\" he said. \"It went from 227 down to 125 per 1,000 births. Niger concentrated on getting health workers into rural areas with simple interventions. The exciting thing is that with the money we have now, we can buy more medicines and save far more lives.\"</p> <p>Countdown said analysis for 2010 showed that 64% of child deaths were attributable to infectious disease and 40% occurred during the neo-natal period. The leading causes of death among older children remain pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria. Chopra said new, more effective and cheap anti-malaria drugs that can be delivered by community workers to people's homes held out great potential. \"The new drugs are much more effective and can be delivered quickly to kids who need it most,\" he said.</p> <p>Over the course of the decade, global malaria deaths have dropped by an estimated 38%, with 43 countries (11 of them in Africa) cutting cases or deaths by 50% or more. This is down to more effective drugs (artemisin combination therapies) \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/apr/05/malaria-drug-artemisinin-lose-potency\" title=\"\">although there are reports of growing resistance to the new drugs</a>, rapid diagnostic tests, long-lasting insecticidal nets (developed since 2000), better policies, and increased resources (human and financial), including distribution of enough bednets to cover nearly 80% of the population at risk in sub-Saharan Africa.</p> <p>Other means of reducing child mortality, such as handwashing and breastfeeding, come down to education rather than money. Modifying behaviour can be difficult, but not impossible. Chopra pointed to <a href=\"http://www.thebody.com/content/art51490.html\" title=\"\">Uganda, where education has led to a significant increase in breastfeeding</a>. \"It is possible to change behaviour and it is being done and can be done in a short period of time,\" he said.</p> <p>The promotion of handwashing in schools in China, Colombia and Egypt has led to a drop in primary school absenteeism due to diarrhoea or respiratory infections of between 20% and 50%.</p> <p>Still, money will be needed to help achieve MDGs on child and maternal mortality, but official development assistance for maternal and child health appears to have plateaued in 2009 after increasingly steadily over the past decade, according to Countdown. In 2009, total official development assistance for maternal, infant and child health increased by 14.1% to $4.5bn from 2008. This compared with increases of 17.1% from 2006 to 2007 and 21.2% from 2007 to 2008.</p>",
  "<p>It's time to stop monkeying around. Climate change is already happening, and we all know we need to make shifts in our personal lifestyle habits to attempt to stem the worst of its effects. Case in point: this week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/26/food-shortages-world-vegetarianism\" title=\"\">brings us a report</a> from leading water scientists who have issued one of the sternest warnings yet about global food supplies, saying that the world's population \"may have to switch almost completely to a vegetarian diet over the next 40 years to avoid catastrophic shortages\".</p> <p>Many of us associate a diet that incorporates meat to be an essential part of a fulfilling life. How do we continue to enjoy our diet when meat is no longer available, or is prohibitively expensive? Well, it might simply require a shift in the way we think about dinnertime.</p> <p>First, we need to jettison the idea of meat as the centre of the plate, which leads to a search for a \"replacement\". This is what has led us to all those dreadful meat analogs \u2013 think about all those dreadful hyper-processed soy patties and fake sausages. Not only are these products horrendously expensive (thus giving vegetarianism a reputation for being an indulgence for the wealthy), they just don't taste great. So forget all that.</p> <p>Instead, let us abolish the idea of a \"main dish\" and dive into the wonderful world of a meal made up of several smaller dishes that compliment each other. Instead of a giant steak with watery green beans, how about green beans long-simmered in olive oil in the Italian tradition, which renders them silky and rich, topped with quickly saut\u00e9ed onions and a sprinkle of smoked paprika, alongside a dish of stewed cannellini white beans with fat plum tomatoes threaded throughout, accompanying angel hair pasta with a quick garlic and oil sauce? This meal can be made in less than an hour, and the leftover beans can become the basis of a bean soup for tomorrow, with some of the leftover olive oil used for the green beans folded in for richness \u2013 with perhaps a pur\u00e9e of a root vegetable like sweet potatoes or carrots stirred in for depth. Add some fresh ground pepper, quality sea salt and a sprinkle of lemon juice, and lunch is on the table.</p> <p>Another way to make a meat-free diet more palatable is to take comfort from the rest of the world's cuisines: there are meatless dietary traditions all around the world, and looking to them can help us understand how one's diet can be joyful and plentiful without animal flesh.</p> <p>Particularly, we can look to what poor women from every corner of the globe have invented. Why? Because they have always created the tastiest dishes \u2013 so many of today's classic, beloved dishes originated from women who had to put food on the table for their families, no matter what. When kings and queens were busy dying from gout because of their overly rich diets, housewives in Sicily were making luscious <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caponata\" title=\"\">caponata</a> from aubergines and celery in a sweet and sour marinade; women in Oaxaca were wrapping corn dough around roasted chilies, seeds, and vegetables to make <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamale\" title=\"\">tamales</a> filled with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_%28sauce%29#Mole_Negro\" title=\"\">mole</a> sauces; cooks in Egypt were frying onions in precious olive oil and topping their lentils and rice with them to make <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushari\" title=\"\">koshari</a>; women in Africa were pounding peanuts to make rich stews laced with fresh greens and spices. Vegetarian dishes are everywhere, if we look.</p> <p>There are also many naturally vegetarian and vegetarian-friendly cuisines that we can take inspiration from. The Japanese Buddhist temple cuisine called <a href=\"http://moonpointer.com/new/2009/02/gastronomy-shojin-ryori/\" title=\"\">Shojin ryori</a> has been free of all animal products for centuries, yet has created some of the most decadent and breathtaking dishes \u2013 many of which are adaptable for modern western kitchens. India, of course, has long traditions of meatless cuisines, and so do many Middle Eastern countries. For example, take the verdant vegetable salad spreads of Morocco: grated carrots scented with oranges; beetroot with cumin and cinnamon; squash with fresh parsley, fresh cilantro, fragrant with sweet paprika, all of them served with fresh and warm flatbread. Simple, everyday kind of food.</p> <p>Throughout most of our history as eaters, meat has been scarce. This has left us with a rich global legacy of delicious naturally vegetarian dishes \u2013 there's no need to dust off 1970s brown rice-heavy cookery books to find vegetarian inspiration. The world itself can be a guide. Vegetarian cooking isn't difficult or pricey. It just asks for a different starting point than we're used to.</p>",
  "<p>A British businessman is receiving \"harsh and unfair treatment\" from the Austrian legal authorities, his lawyer, Lord Goldsmith QC, has told the foreign secretary.</p> <p>The former attorney general wrote to William Hague last month about Julius Meinl, 53, a banker of Austrian descent. The businessman's lawyers have also made an application to the European court of human rights.</p> <p>Meinl was arrested at the state prosecutor's office in Vienna in April 2009, after attending voluntarily for interview. As a condition of bail, he was required to pay an extraordinary \u20ac100m into court - more than \u00a378m at current rates and believed to be a world record in any jurisdiction. </p> <p>Although the Austrian authorities have spent the past five years investigating alleged market manipulation by a property fund in which Meinl was not directly involved, he is the only person to have been arrested as a result of the investigation. Nobody has been charged and Meinl's bail money has not been returned.</p> <p>Complaining about the delay in dealing with the case, Goldsmith said his client's treatment was a breach of natural justice and caused \"the greatest concern\".</p> <p>The QC, head of European and Asian litigation at the international law firm Debevoise and Plimpton, urged Hague to raise Meinl's case with the Austrian authorities. He told the foreign secretary: \"There is a strong suspicion that the authorities have been reacting to public pressure from some quarters, which in turn is coloured by Mr Meinl's Jewish family background.\"</p> <p>Meinl is the fifth member of his family to bear the name of his great-great-grandfather, who founded an upmarket food retailing empire in 1862 on the idea of selling ready-roasted coffee beans. The family were forced to flee Austria in 1938 because Meinl's grandfather had married a woman of Jewish origin. </p> <p>After the war, the family were granted British nationality. Meinl's father served as a pilot in the RAF and his grandfather helped Britain to identify Nazi sympathisers who were still occupying positions of authority in Austria.</p> <p>Later, the family returned to Austria and re-established the family business as the equivalent of a cross between Fortnums and Waitrose. They also developed their customer savings division into Meinl Bank, one of Austria's most successful banking operations.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, the family sold their retailing business and moved into investment banking. A Jersey-registered property fund called Meinl European Land (MEL) was established, based on the company's property portfolio. The fund also bought shopping centres in the former Soviet bloc. Meinl Bank acted as MEL's sponsor and investment bank.</p> <p>In 2007, the property fund's value dropped heavily. Small investors, perhaps unfamiliar with the ways of the markets, were outraged to discover that a fund named after such a well-respected brand could go down in value as well as up. Meinl, who headed the bank's executive board, was held personally responsible by the Austrian public even though he was not directly involved in MEL. An Austrian business magazine called Format implicitly compared him to Hitler with a <a href=\"http://derstandard.at/1242315963031/Meinls-Kampf-Format-Cover-Meinl-tief-betroffen\">cover-story</a> headlined \"Meinls Kampf\".</p> <p>Attention centred on allegations that MEL had unlawfully bought back its own shares in order to prop up their price, shortly before the global financial crisis. Not so, Meinl told me when I <a href=\"http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/opinion/joshua-rozenberg/julius-meinl-s-predicament-should-disturb-common-law-jurisdictions\">interviewed him</a> in 2009. There was no market manipulation, he said: MEL had decided to repurchase its shares in order to sell a significant stake to a potential strategic partner.</p> <p>At that time, I had no way of testing Meinl's response. The Jersey financial services commission had appointed inspectors to investigate the allegation that MEL had provided financial assistance to itself to purchase its own shares - which would have been contrary to Jersey law - but their investigations were still continuing.</p> <p>It was not until December 2010 that the commission <a href=\"http://www.jerseyfsc.org/the_commission/general_information/press_releases/release263.asp\">concluded</a>, on the strength of the inspectors' findings, that the MEL buy-back had not been in breach of the island's laws. At the same time, though, the Jersey regulator announced an inquiry into whether MEL's directors had acted in a fit and proper manner.</p> <p>In February 2012, the Jersey commission declared its investigation closed. It <a href=\"http://www.jerseyfsc.org/the_commission/general_information/press_releases/release279.asp\">announced</a> that three former directors of MEL had given voluntary undertakings not to run other Jersey companies in future without the commission's prior consent, while stressing that this was not to be taken as any acceptance of wrongdoing by any of the three. Meinl was not one of them: he had never been a director of MEL or the separate Jersey company that acted as its manager.</p> <p>Meinl's lawyers say that the Jersey commission would not have accepted voluntary undertakings and closed its investigations if it had found any breach of the criminal law. The property fund, known as Atrium since a change of ownership in 2009, <a href=\"http://www.aere.com/Files/PressRelease/12%2008%2017%20Atrium%20H1%202012%20results%20highlights%20Final.pdf \">reported</a> \"excellent operational performance\" earlier this month.</p> <p>In his letter to the foreign secretary, Goldsmith accepts that there are limits to any British intervention in another country's criminal investigations. So Meinl's Austrian lawyers have also lodged an application at the human rights court in Strasbourg, arguing that the seizure of Meinl's correspondence with his lawyers and the excessive delay in investigating the allegations have denied him his right to a fair trial under article 6 of the convention.</p> <p>Perhaps more promisingly, Meinl's lawyers argue that setting his bail at \u20ac100m breached article 5 of the convention, the right to liberty. They accept that bail of \u20ac3 million was <a href=\"http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=002-822\">upheld</a> in the case of a ship's captain accused of responsibility for spilling oil into the Atlantic ocean. But that figure, they say, was on the very edge of admissibility. And this is 33 times as much.</p> <p>The lawyers also complain that the Austrian courts found that Meinl was a greater flight risk because of his British nationality. They argue that article 14 of the convention taken together with article 6 means that the right to a fair trial must be upheld without discrimination on grounds of national origin.</p> <p>If this application gets as far as the Strasbourg court, the Austrian government can be expected to argue that Meinl has not been deprived of his right to a fair trial, has not been treated any worse because he is British and was able to produce \u20ac100m within the day. </p> <p>What the Austrians may find harder to answer is why their investigation has taken so long and why were not willing to follow the findings of the Jersey authorities. Of course investigating and prosecuting fraud is difficult; and nobody knows that better than the former attorney general who, for six years, was ultimately responsible for all prosecutions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But still, he notes, \"the investigation drags on\". </p> <p>The Austrian legal authorities may yet be able to establish that they have not been influenced by anti-British or anti-Jewish sentiments. On this, though, the jury is still out.</p>",

But stop there: that's exactly the kind of orientalist cliche that is out of step with the new box-office era, as the American studios and China's own film-makers readjust to the new clout of the country's film-goers, now the second most lucrative audience in the world.</p> <p>\"Everyone in Hollywood is trying to figure how to crack this market,\" says Mintz, 'How do we get in? What do we do with it?' But you can't necessarily approach a film like that, 'cos it's not a widget business. We've all seen those films. If you're trying to make soup, following a recipe, good luck.\"</p> <p>Mintz's company DMG (Dynamic Marketing Group) \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/56104/mintz-dynasty\" title=\"\">Beijing-based media agency with nearly 20 years' experience</a> \u2013 is getting into the business of fusion cuisine, cinematically speaking. The time-travel feature <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148727/looper\" title=\"\">Looper</a>, directed by Rian Johnson, will be their first attempt at simultaneously piquing the palates of US and Chinese audiences. The script was rewritten when DMG came on board, offering both finance (reportedly 40% of its $60m budget) and a crucial co-production status, which allowed the independent film to bypass China's foreign-film quota. Originally, Paris in 2077 had played a key role in the film, but Mintz insisted this be changed to Shanghai.</p> <p>DMG were never going to go for the hackneyed mainstream depictions of the country: yellow-peril skulduggery, dragons-and-lanterns romanticism, or the kind of fortune-cookie descents into Chinatown that recently got Men in Black 3 <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/world-news/asia-pacific/china-cuts-its-baddies-out-of-men-in-black-3-3124442.html\" title=\"\">trimmed by Beijing censors</a>. Mintz says that Looper is groundbreaking in one key respect: \"It's talking about China in the future, and there's never been a film that's done that. Even China has never made one.\" Press him for specifics about how the film deals with the potentially awkward geopolitical implications of the predictions game \u2013 like suggestions that his adopted country might be more powerful than the US \u2013 and he is a bit evasive, talking about fulfilling \"mutual visions\" and \"creative scenarios\", and the \"humanity of the piece\" trumping the politics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397052239\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346256077701/Dan-Mintz-001.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Mintz\" width=\"220\" height=\"155\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gatekeeper \u2026 DMG's Dan Mintz.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wonder if this isn't a taste of the face-saving obfuscation that is necessary to thrive in the modern Chinese business world. The 47-year-old Mandarin-speaking Staten Island native was ahead of the curve in choosing to set up in the country: he established DMG in Beijing in 1993, and built a business creating advertising spots for the global and local brands that benefited from the explosion of Chinese capitalism. He seems to have the knack of gently pushing the boundaries with the authorities: <a href=\"http://www.tvspots.tv/video/32700/VOLKSWAGEN-SHANGHAI-VW--FAW-VW--VW-CHINA--STRAIGHT-FROM-THE-HEART\" title=\"\">one pioneering campaign</a> for Volkswagen was based around characters for virtues \u2013 \"loyalty\", \"wisdom\", \"ambition\" \u2013 that DMG wanted to associate with the cars. The traditional ideograms had been banned during the Cultural Revolution, but Mintz and his partners persuaded officials to regard them as artworks, not as symbols, allowing the campaign to pass.</p> <p>Hollywood is knocking on Mintz's door because of this kind of careful strategic insight. \"In the States, we're always focused on what the fans want, what the consumers want,\" he says, \"Whereas in China, there are two groups of people we need to be aware of: the government and the consumer. We look at that as access and relevancy. Some people have one but not the other, and that's when problems arise. Some people might have access but no one wants to go see it, or some people have a great movie, but can't get it into the country. That sweet spot is key.\"</p> <p>It's clear that, better than most western companies, DMG have cracked the access part of the equation: Looper, in an extended cut with more Chinese material, is getting a velvet-rope release at the start of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Week_%28China%29\" title=\"\">Golden Week</a> holiday; other Hollywood hopefuls, like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, are still sometimes forced by the communist party to share release dates and cannibalise each other's profits.</p> <p>But relevancy is less simple, because DMG isn't solely targeting the domestic audience (though it makes those kinds of films, too). Mintz says they will make global movies, \"with China as the wind to our backs\" \u2013 but there's a tension between the two requirements. It may be surfacing in the production of Iron Man 3, whose Chinese hookup, with DMG on board as producers and distributors, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/apr/17/iron-man-3-collaboration-china\" title=\"\">was trumpeted back in April</a>. There was some internet debate about how Marvel and DMG were going to make the film Sino-friendly, in particular mooted villain the Mandarin, who was a beard-stroking <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_%28comics%29\" title=\"\">Fu Manchu knockoff</a> in the comics. Then Iron Man 3's whole eastern direction seemed to be thrown into question when director Shane Black <a href=\"http://www.chinesefilms.cn/141/2012/07/23/141s10845.htm\" title=\"\">denied at Comic-Con there would be any first-unit presence in China at all</a>.</p> <p>Mintz categorically says that Iron Man 3 will shoot in the country, and that announcements about Chinese actors will be made shortly. But <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Mandarin-Confirmed-Iron-Man-3-Villain-31931.html\" title=\"\">Ben Kingsley is playing the Mandarin</a>, and it's difficult not to detect some struggle over \"relevancy\". As Mintz points out, the world's two biggest movie markets \u2013 the US and China \u2013 are also the most culturally different, and he has elected to marry the two.</p> <p>But then Mintz seems accustomed to performing balancing acts. He says that staying constantly aware of his environment has been the most important lesson he has learned; even his interview manner, a sort of scampering assemblage of points slightly unbecoming for a CEO, suggests empirical nosing-about, not fixed conclusions. Which brings us back to the importance of the right question.</p> <p>\"The first question a lot of people ask me is, 'What brought you to China?' But that's not really the question,\" he says, \"The question is, 'Why'd you stay?' The reason is a moment in time. It was a realisation that what I could witness here, I could never witness again. I'm from New York \u2013 greatest city in the world. But somebody already built that.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Looper is out in the UK on 28 September. After Hollywood is taking a break \u2013 and will be back on 2 October. Meanwhile, what global box-office stories would you like to see covered in the column? Let us know in the comments below.</p>",

In an article in the Daily Telegraph, he claimed that environmental objections to a third runway were disappearing.</p> <p>However, Justine Greening, the transport secretary, said it was \"not a long-term solution\".</p> <p>\"We do need to look long term. One of the problems of the third runway \u2013 aside from noise, air pollution and surface access \u2013 is that it's not a full-length runway, it can't take the major new planes. The question then is, where would the fourth one go?</p> <p>\"It's time to move away from the piecemeal approach to aviation capacity. We need to look long term, start to be more bold, and think what our country needs in 30, 40, 50 years' time.\"</p> <p>There has been speculation that Greening may be moved from her post in a forthcoming reshuffle.</p> <p>Pressed on the Radio 4 Today programme whether she would sit in a cabinet that approved a third runway, she admitted it would be difficult, but said: \"I don't think the question arises.\"</p> <p>Downing Street said later the coalition would stick by its commitment that there would not be a third runway.</p> <p>\"The coalition parties have made a pledge not to have a third runway and that is a pledge that we will keep,\" a No 10 spokeswoman said. \"We don't see the argument for a third runway.\"</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, speaking during a visit to a manufacturing firm in Wallsend, North Tyneside, said ministers would stick to the coalition agreement, which ruled out the expansion.</p> <p>He said: \"We're not going to give the go-ahead to the third runway at Heathrow because we said very clearly as both parties that we wouldn't do so, so we're going to stick to the coalition agreement.</p> <p>\"But that doesn't mean we're going to stick our heads in the sand over the aviation debate about capacity in this country and how we make sure we have those proper connections to economies in Asia and Latin America that are important to our own prosperity, and we'll make sure we look at that.</p> <p>\"But there are lots of ways of doing that and we shouldn't just lurch to one solution because one individual MP was to say so.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Yeo had written: \"The prime minister must ask himself whether he is a man or a mouse. Does he want to be another Harold Macmillan, presiding over a dignified slide towards insignificance?</p> <p>\"Or is there somewhere inside his heart \u2013 an organ that still remains impenetrable to most Britons \u2013 a trace of Thatcher, determined to reverse the direction of our ship.</p> <p>\"An immediate go-ahead for a third runway will symbolise the start of a new era, the moment a Cameron government found its sense of mission. Let's go for it.\"</p> <p>In an interview with the BBC, Yeo insisted he was not \"throwing down a gauntlet\" to Cameron, but said: \"I am saying there is a terrific opportunity for him to show really strong leadership from the front \u2026 and to set out something which is not clear to everyone yet, what his vision of Britain is going to be in 2020.</p> <p>Yeo added: \"There's really every possible argument in favour of it, what it does need is political courage. That's what I'm calling for.\"</p> <p>Greening said she would publish a long-awaited consultation on airport capacity as soon as parliament returned in September. This would consist of a \"call for evidence on hub capacity\" \u2013 namely, airports large enough to cater for connecting flights, which Heathrow's owners, BAA, claim is imperative to make more routes feasible.</p> <p>For many in aviation this consultation is the crucial marker of government plans, and its postponement this summer meant a framework policy paper published by Greening \u2013 with plans for more stringent regulation on aircraft noise, the biggest objection to Heathrow expansion from residents in south-west London \u2013 was largely ignored.</p> <p>Greening said the call for evidence would allow arguments for expanding Heathrow, and BAA could \"make their case\", but she insisted: \"I don't think any of the facts have changed around the third runway.\"</p> <p>The coalition agreement opposes any expansion of airports in the south-east. The Conservatives have continued officially to rule out a third Heathrow runway, which they cancelled on taking office, but the chancellor, George Osborne, is believed to be a closet supporter of expansion.</p> <p>Many Tory backbenchers have lent support to the Heathrow cause. Recently the housing minister, Grant Shapps \u2013 tipped by some as a possible successor to Greening if she were to move \u2013 warned that a third runway was needed to ensure the UK remained a \"great trading nation\".</p> <p>Boris Johnson accused Cameron of \"pussyfooting around\" the issue of expansion. The London mayor's idea of a Thames estuary airport looks set to be considered, although birdstrike, lack of infrastructure, airspace constraints and other issues make it appear a problematic solution.</p> <p>Yeo, who chairs the Commons energy committee, was previously a high-profile opponent of expansion, but now argues that European Union carbon emissions caps will force airlines to use more environmentally friendly planes if they want to use new capacity at Heathrow.</p> <p>Labour has called for immediate cross-party talks on airport capacity. The shadow transport secretary, Maria Eagle, said: \"While ministers fight amongst themselves, the paralysis at the heart of government on aviation is now adding to the paralysis in our economy.\"</p>",

  "<p>In showcasing <a href=\"http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Great Ormond Street hospital</a> during the Olympics opening ceremony, Danny Boyle recognised that we have a National Health Service to be proud of. Great Ormond Street hospital, GOSH to its friends, is a global brand \u2013 without doubt one of the most famous children's hospitals in the world, and one with a reputation for quality and innovation, delivering services that are unique in the UK.</p> <p>We have other similar brands - the Royal Marsden, Moorfields and other specialist hospitals \u2013 as well as academic health science centres <a href=\"http://www.london.nhs.uk/what-we-do/promoting-innovation/academic-health-science-centres-ahscs\" title=\"\">(AHSCs)</a>, such as Imperial, Cambridge and UCL Partners. These are centred on teaching hospitals, which are at the top of global academic league tables. Collectively and individually, they all punch well above their weight scientifically and enable our patients to access world-class treatments and technologies.</p> <p>Encouraging the NHS to export this expertise has raised a few eyebrows. It has been suggested the move could harm the NHS. Yet building the reputation of the NHS beyond these shores could build capacity and capability.</p> <p>The idea is not new \u2013 AHSCs in the US have been supporting services overseas for many years. Johns Hopkins University pioneered medical and nursing training at Peking Union Medical College in the 1910s. Duke University runs a graduate medical school in Singapore and many American academic institutions deliver services across the globe. It is hard to imagine Americans would see the brands of their great hospitals being undermined by global activities and reputations. Likewise in the UK, many of our hospitals provide private medical care to overseas patients, which generates funds to deliver NHS services. And they do it without damaging the brand in the process.</p> <p>There are also chains of private hospitals delivering high-quality care across continents \u2013 so why shouldn't one of the best healthcare systems in the world?</p> <p>Indeed raising the private patient cap and enabling NHS foundation trusts to increase their income from this activity is an important aspect of delivering financial sustainability to a number of organisations. A move of this nature would, in turn, also deliver better services for patients within the UK.</p> <p>We have hidden the NHS light under a bushel for too long. For many years <a href=\"http://www.commonwealthfund.org/\" title=\"\">Commonwealth Fund reports</a> have put the NHS at or near the top of a league of health services of industrialised countries. For chronic and serious illness it performs consistently highly \u2013 for co-ordination of care, patient safety and the way patients are engaged in their care.</p> <p>Building the NHS brand, and singing about a service that should be the envy of the world, as Danny Boyle did, can only be positive. Not only will this initiative take the capability overseas \u2013 for the benefit of other patients and healthcare systems \u2013 but it could help recruit high-calibre clinical and scientific talent, making these organisations more exciting places to work.</p> <p>Perhaps, however, 'export' is the wrong term? It suggests goods being made in the UK and shipped overseas. This idea is about much more. It is about leveraging the NHS as a brand, building capability and capacity as well as enhancing our understanding and our global contribution in such an important area. Healthcare is a global issue \u2013 and taking a parochial view from within these shores is neither helpful, nor appropriate.</p> <p><em>Hilary Thomas is a senior partner in KPMG Management Consulting's healthcare advisory team</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>JRP Solutions began as a company in the 1990s. It is an independent consultant specialising in three key areas: energy, carbon and facilities.</p> <p>George Richards, sales and marketing manager, says that the company last year realised it needed to raise its profile. Despite having international blue-chip clients, JRP was relatively \"unknown\". To change this, he harnessed the power of internet marketing.</p> <p>Richards points out that a sophisticated web presence is key to capturing the imagination of existing clients and to win new business. He says: \"It is not good enough to have a first generation website, you have to use appropriate media for your target market. As an example we have just uploaded a customer testimonial video, and linked it to our website via YouTube. This has allowed us to maintain our company profile and direct traffic to our website.\"</p> <p>JRP Solutions largely focuses on companies within the petrochemicals industry and the food and drinks sector to win new business. Richards cites this industry and sector as being very energy intensive and coming under increasing financial pressure.</p> <p>He says: \"The only way energy usage is going is up. They also have sector targets to meet in terms of carbon emissions and improving their environmental performance. Anything they can do to reduce their energy consumption is a good thing.\"</p> <p>The company has therefore developed, along with other key customers, an 'energy catalyst' which is a new methodology that focuses upon \"reducing demand side energy consumption in manufacturing environment by up to 30%\".</p> <p>Unlike other energy consultants, JRP will go in and identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption in the process itself, with a project payback of 18 months or less. They will also implement measures, project manage and advise, which is the key to keeping their existing clients and winning new business.</p> <p>For example, JRP has recently been working with a cake manufacturer. With this project, Richards was looking at how to reduce the heating and cooling processes of the business as 80% to 90% of their energy was going towards making cakes. He says: \"In this instance JRP wasn't telling this cake manufacturer how to make cakes better, but how to cut back on their energy processes and minimise consumption.\"</p> <p>The company also prides itself in maintaining strong long-term relationships with its existing clients. In particular one global powers systems manufacturer, with which they have had a 15-year relationship. JRP views building these long-term working relationships as a selling point when trying to win new business.</p> <p>\"In the future, JRP wants to be recognised as one of the leading energy catalysts,\" says Richards.</p> <p>And inspirational figures? Who does JRP most admire in the business world?</p> <p>\"The founders of JRP take their inspiration from entrepreneur Richard Branson. He is a pioneer, a visionary and an inspirational leader, and the culture which he engenders within his businesses, is one that encourages entrepreneurship, innovation and people to use their initiative.\"</p> <p><strong>Website: </strong><a href=\"http://www.jrpsolutions.com/\">http://www.jrpsolutions.com/</a></p> <p><em>There are three more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Exporting, Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>Nishul Saperia, along with co-founders Imran Ali Merza (a former City trader) and Tahzeen Basunia (a chartered accountant) decided to set up Jealous because they found a gap in the world of confectionery \u2013 a lack of premium luxury sweets for adults.</p> <p>Jealous sells sweets that are gelatine-free, gluten-free and free from artificial colours and flavours. Customers can chose from gift boxes called \"Gummy Heaven\", \"Sinfully Sour\", \"Paradise Lost\" and \"Enchanted Eden.\"</p> <p>Their business idea started a couple of years ago when Ali Merza wanted to buy some sweets for his girlfriend, who was vegetarian, and he found there was nothing out there.</p> <p>\"I really struggled to find any vegetarian sweets, also sweets for Muslim or Jewish people,\" says Merza. </p> <p>Since stocking their brand of sweets at two upmarket department stores \u2013 one on Oxford Street and the other in Knightsbridge, they have been encouraged to win more new business. Their strategy is one of persistence and determination. Saperia says: \"We find gaps in the market where we believe demand could be created, research those markets thoroughly and work to create innovative products which we believe will fill those gaps. We then identify current and especially new relevant sales channels not being exploited today.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"We consider the needs and psychology of buyers and potential customers and work to position the product to fit those needs. We also rely on social media, marketing, word of mouth.\"</p> <p>The co-founders admit that it was initially very difficult to capture the attention of any buyers, let alone high-profile buyers, as they get so many products sent to them. But they had complete faith in their product and created glossy brochures and luxury gift sets. The company brought its product to market in spring 2011 after \"two years of hard work\". Saperia adds it also took \"one year of research, going to a lot of global trade fairs, speaking to potential customers, and validating our concept.\"</p> <p>Merza, Basunia and Saperia want to appeal to an adult market with their product, and target those who are keen on giving their friends, family and partners luxury sweets as gifts. Saperia admits there are very few companies out there competing for their share of the market: \"Our products are unique, that is our selling point and that is how we win new business.\"</p> <p>The co-founders of Jealous are looking to expand on the \"Jealous brand\" in the future, not just to include sweets but other products, and perhaps create a lifestyle brand, hence the flexible name.</p> <p>They take inspiration from business figures like Adam Balon, Richard Reed and Jon Wright who founded the smoothie giant Innocent. Saperia says: \"They started with an idea and went on to not only launch a successful product but a brand identity that has come to dominate their market.\"</p> <p>And their advice for any other retail entrepreneurs: \"Be persistent, know your product and brand inside out when confronting a potential buyer at any retail outlet. Present a prototype or finished product to a potential buyer, they haven't got time to imagine what the end product may be like.\"</p> <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thejealouslife.com/\">http://www.thejealouslife.com/</a></p> <p><em>There are three more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Exporting, Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>Righteous managing director Gem Misa left her job as brand manager for Unilever to follow her dream of starting her own food business.</p> <p>Righteous sells natural salad dressings and their products can be found on the shelves of supermarkets such as Tesco and Waitrose and hundreds of independent food retailers in the UK.</p> <p>Inspiration for setting up the business largely came from the belief that her home-made recipes tasted great and she wanted to share them with other people. Misa also wanted to keep her recipes as natural and free from flavour enhancers as possible.</p> <p>She adds: \"I was lucky to meet some great food technologists and producers along the way who have worked tirelessly to preserve my original flavours, without adding artificial flavourings and preservatives; and also managed to keep saturated fats and trans fats to an absolute minimum.\"</p> <p>When it comes to winning new business, Misa believes persistence is key. In her field of retail, she had to be persistent to secure that crucial first meeting with the supermarket buyers - after a number of rejections, she sent picnic hampers to the board of one supermarket, which eventually won them over. She admits that getting a hearing for your company is difficult for new entrants to the industry but stresses: \"Don't give up until you secure that first meeting\".</p> <p>Misa's persistence has paid off for Righteous. In their current third year of trading Righteous salad dressings can be found in over 800 major supermarkets in the UK and overseas.</p> <p>Other advice to win new business in her field is to prepare a compelling pitch. Questions to bear in mind while making the pitch can include: Why is your product different? What is the gap in the market you are filling? Also, Misa recommends studying the profile of the company (or in this case the supermarket) you are approaching to understand why your product is attractive to their customers, and how it will increase the value of the category.</p> <p>\"Finally, let your product speak for itself. You need to be absolutely convinced that you have a winning product in your hands.

  "<p>It was billed as a \"warm goat's cheese tart\" \u2013 an innocuous enough item on a pretty undistinguished menu. But when it eventually arrived, the goat's cheese was molten lava and the puff pastry sinking into soggy submission. It was clear that my starter had been subjected to an intense encounter with a microwave oven, and it was so unpleasant, and boded so ill for the rest of the meal, that we cancelled our main course order, paid the bill and \u2013 there's no other word for it \u2013 flounced. To this day, when my partner and I walk past the restaurant in question, we make a point of saying \"ping!\" as loudly as we can. We may forgive, but we do not forget.</p> <p>It appears that I'm not alone in my intolerant stance on the use of microwaves in restaurants. In a 2011 review of The Rose and Crown in Snettisham (which, incidentally, succeeded in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/02/aa-gill-spittle-flecked-indignation-norfolk\">mortally offending the entire population of Norfolk</a>), the critic AA Gill wrote: \"The staff were charming and friendly. The menu is, they say, 'a mixture of the traditional with a contemporary twist'. I suspect the twist is the timer on the microwave.\" Ouch. <br><br>A 2010 documentary for French television lamented that standards of cooking are collapsing as industrially produced ready-meals, untrained cooks and microwave ovens <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/7285770/Majority-of-French-restaurants-using-ready-made-factory-food.html\">take the place of traditional skills and fresh ingredients</a> in high-end restaurants. And who hasn't perused the menu at a \"gastro-pub\" and noted with a sinking heart the lack of anything grilled and the tell-tale inclusion of cottage pie, lasagne and \"authentic\" curries that suggest the absence of any actual cooking and the lurking presence of a well-stocked freezer and much-used microwave?</p> <p>But there are restaurants at both ends of the scale that nuke with pride. Gaby's Deli on Charing Cross Road is a favourite with celebs and foodies alike \u2013 so much so that its threatened closure earlier this year spawned protests, petitions and a <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/save.gabys.deli\">Facebook page</a>. But place your order for salt beef or falafel and the food is put into the microwave \u2013 there, right before your eyes! \u2013 and seems none the worse for it. The legendary <a href=\"http://www.playingwithfireandwater.com/foodplay/2008/07/microwave-chocolate-cake.html\">Ferran Adri\u00e0 of El Bulli cooks a sponge cake</a> using a plastic cup, nitrous oxide and a microwave. Heston Blumenthal has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2004/feb/28/foodanddrink.shopping3\">extolled the virtues of the microwave</a> for producing perfectly cooked fennel, and Daniel Galmiche of The Vineyard at Stockcross has gone so far as to enter into a <a href=\"http://www.panasonic.co.uk/html/en_GB/News/Latest+News/Partnership+with+Michelin+Starred+Chef+Daniel+Galmiche/8430583/index.html\">Faustian pact with Panasonic</a> that sees him <a href=\"http://theideaskitchen.co.uk/cook/daniel-galmiches-blog/\">blogging enthusiastically</a> about microwaved potato gratin, mussels and even chocolate tart.</p> <p>Whether it's because of concerns about the health effects of microwaves on food (almost universally discredited but <a href=\"http://www.davidicke.com/headlines/65646-why-did-russia-ban-the-use-of-microwave-ovens\">perpetuated by David Icke</a> and the like), or the more sensible belief that microwave use is a way for restaurants to cut staff costs by dispensing with the skills required to cook food \u00e0 la minute, with attendant disregard for quality, it can be hard to persuade restaurateurs to fess up to the presence of a microwave in the kitchen. Heston Blumenthal's PR office told me loftily that the technology used at The Fat Duck is \"far above that level\" \u2013 so no more perfect fennel, then? A query to the <a href=\"http://www.tragusgroup.com/\">Tragus Group</a>, operator of Strada, Bella Italia and Cafe Rouge, met with a coy, \"We have a very limited of number [sic] dishes and ingredients which require microwave use.\"</p> <p>Guy Awford, chef and founder of two of my favourite local restaurants, <a href=\"http://www.insiderestaurant.co.uk/\">Inside</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguildfordarms.co.uk/\">Guy Awford at the Guildford Arms</a>, was more forthcoming. \"We have small microwaves in both restaurants,\" he says, \"and they're useful for warming up small amounts of couscous and rice, which needs to be kept in the fridge until just before service.\" Ian Riley, chef at the much-praised <a href=\"http://brixtoncornercopia.ning.com/\">Cornercopia</a> in Brixton Village Market, is similarly pragmatic. \"At Cornercopia we work as sustainably as possible, and to save using the stove I melt and clarify butter in the microwave. It's indispensable for that; it melts the butter quickly and evenly. But ... It's a cheat to use them a lot.\"</p> <p>Some of the best home cooks I know happily turn to their microwaves for scrambling eggs, defrosting batch-cooked chilli and bolognese sauce, melting chocolate and cooking porridge. Although I don't have one in my own kitchen, I'm rather partial to nuked <a href=\"http://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/things-we-make/veg-pots/thai-vegetable-sweet-chilli\">Innocent Veg Pots</a> and sometimes think it would be worth sacrificing some counter space for the convenience of quickly warming a bowl of soup or defrosting vegetables.</p> <p>But in a restaurant? I still feel uncomfortable. Perhaps it's just snobbery. Should we embrace the microwave as a planet-friendly, economical piece of kit in the professional kitchen? Or would you, too, be tempted to call for the bill and leave in a huff if you heard the tell-tale ping before your starter arrived?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Cairn Energy</strong> has signed a deal in Morocco as part of its move to diversify from its - so far disappointing - projects in Greenland.</p> <p>The company is paying $60m towards the costs of an exploration well at Foum Draa off southern Morocco in return for a 50% stake in a licence shared with a number of smaller groups, including <strong>Serica Energy</strong>.</p> <p>Having sold the bulk of its business in India, Cairn had put great store in its Greenland exploration plans but has so far failed to find oil. So it has diversified into the North Sea, and has also moved into the Mediterranean and off the coast of Morocco. Chief executive Simon Thomson said:</p> <blockquote> Cairn is actively re-balancing its portfolio to deliver exploration led-growth. <br> </blockquote> <p>In its half year results Cairn lost $50m but tax credits led to a profit after tax of $37m. Analysts said the figures were in line and after a recent good run, investors have taken profits. Cairn's shares have dropped 15p to 281.3p, a 5% decline, while Serica is off 0.5p at 28.75p.</p> <p>Investec analyst Stuart Joyner kept his buy recommendation on Cairn but cut his target price:</p> <blockquote> Our target price falls from 429p a share to 363p a share reflecting the sharp fall in the value of the residual stake in Cairn India since we last published. </blockquote> <p>Overall, after the long bank holiday weekend, the market has dipped lower albeit in thin trading. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is down 10.80 points at 5765.80, as traders hold fire ahead of the Jackson Hole meeting in the US later in the week, with hopes of further news on any Federal Reserve measures to boost the world's largest economy.</p> <p><strong>Kingfisher</strong>, the B&amp;Q owner, is leading the way lower, down 9.7p at 276p following news that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has slashed its rating from buy to underperform. The bank said it was worried about the effect of a French slowdown on its operations in the country, with the UK and Poland unlikely to make up for any downturn. So any cash return to shareholders could come later than expected, and be smaller than hoped. Merrill cut its price target from 330p to 270p.</p> <p><strong>G4S</strong> is down 6p at 260.2p after it confirmed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/28/g4s-50m-hit-olympics-contract\" title=\"\">a \u00a350m hit on its chaotic Olympics contract.</a></p> <p>Miners were also weaker on worries about global growth, with <strong>Kazakhmys </strong>falling 20.5p to 640p as a number of brokers cut their recommendations in the wake of last week's half year results.</p>",
  "<p>With graduate unemployment still high, it's important to get ahead of the game when it comes to the job market. Here's some advice on how you can prepare for your future at university.</p> <p><strong>1. Aim high</strong><br>The graduate unemployment statistics may be worrying, and with <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CD8QFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.highfliers.co.uk%2Fdownload%2FGMReport12.pdf&amp;ei=zT83UL30NoXb0QW4j4GwDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVXvWRNZ23WhsjExm4XisgPiRSjg&amp;cad=rja\">19% increase in job applications</a>, competition is stiff.&#xa0;The demand for the best and brightest talent is, however, getting stronger and there will be a predicted 6% increase in graduate salaries at leading employers this year with 6% more vacancies out there.</p> <p><strong>2. Know your limitations</strong><br>Also consider the restrictions of the job market.&#xa0;Some feel they should step into an office on their first day and feel instantly that this is the perfect job which ticks all the boxes. Unfortunately, that is quite rare.</p> <p>There will always be some tough trade-offs and choices to be made; it will be your responsibility to react accordingly. It can be hard to know if something is right or not. Decide what your priorities are \u2013 to earn as much money as possible, get relevant experience to get you to your next job, or simply to enjoy your work as much as possible. Once you know what you want out of a job, you'll know if it's ticking the boxes. If you are finding something highly unsatisfying for over a month, however, it's probably not the job for you, and it may be time to move on.</p> <p><strong>3. Get to know yourself</strong></p> <p>Create a personality profile and be brutally honest with yourself. When you first begin applying for roles, you shouldn't be applying for a role because it is expected of you, you should be doing so because that role excites you.<br>Do you like meeting new people (maybe sales), crunching data (financial analysis) or solving problems (management consultancy)? School, university and part-time work provide ideal situations where you can find out more about what you enjoy doing, and what you don't. Armed with this information, you will be in a better position to know what career you would like to pursue.</p> <p><strong>4. Understand the importance of internships and work experience</strong><br>With 36% of graduate roles being <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCkQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.highfliers.co.uk%2Fdownload%2FGMReport12.pdf&amp;ei=jkE3UPvfKaiW0QXd5YAY&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVXvWRNZ23WhsjExm4XisgPiRSjg&amp;cad=rja\">filled by people who have previously worked in that organisation</a> \u2013 with figures as high as 75% in the banking sector \u2013 the importance of spring weeks, insight days and vacation schemes cannot be stressed enough. Remember, all internships, at all times, are job interviews. </p> <p><strong>5. All experience is good experience</strong><br>How do you know for sure that banking is for if you if you have never tried it? How do you know that start-ups won't provide the best environment for career development when you only focus on corporate juggernauts? Understanding the value of experience, no matter how small, will stand you in good stead. Plus, it shows future recruiters you're thinking about your career (remember to put these experiences on your CV).</p> <p><strong>6.Recognise the type of job you want</strong><br>A lot of graduates get hung-up on the sector (eg finance) rather than the role (eg account manager), not realising that most organisations need a similar teams of people \u2013 people to win business, conduct research, write software etc. Another common misconception is that you will be pigeon-holed by your degree. As long as you can demonstrate transferable skills, future employers are more likely to take notice. </p> <p><strong>7. Network, network, network</strong><br>Remember the six of degrees of separation idea? Use this to your advantage. Career networking has taken off over the last couple of years: recruiters will be running events on campus; most sectors will have professional bodies that run networking events, <a href=\"http://www.cim.co.uk/events/EventsCalendar.aspx\">such as these by the Chartered Institute of Marketing</a>, and there is <a href=\"http://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/festival\">Bright Festival</a> on 17 September. Be broad with your networking to begin with \u2013 it's all about keeping your options open and you never what useful contact you might meet. </p> <p><strong>8. Recognise the skills you gain from experience</strong><br>A summer spent waitressing at corporate events may not be enjoyable, but it will provide you with any number of competencies \u2013 organisation, leadership and the ability to keep a cool-head in a potentially stressful environment. The more you develop these skills the less of a risk you are to recruiter \u2013 they know you can do what you'll be doing in your new job, rather than you just saying you can.</p> <p><strong>9. Ask for help from your parents, but don't let them do it for you</strong><br>It's great if you've got very supportive parents \u2013 use them to help your self-awareness and give you insights. But you need to drive things and make things happen for yourself \u2013 it's your career and you're the one that will have to sit through a job interview/assessment centre. There is nothing more likely to turn a recruiter off than being called by a parent inquiring with their child's application (it happens).</p> <p><strong>10. Be as prepared as you can for the unexpected</strong><br>Attend mock interviews (often provided by your university career service), think about <a href=\"http://www.interview-skills.co.uk/competency-based-interviews-STAR.aspx\">interview techniques like STAR</a>, practice online assessment tests and get your CV presentation sorted (remember, no more than one page). Draft a list of answers to possible questions with key examples that demonstrate all your transferable skills.&#xa0;Also, make a list of questions to ask employers \u2013 don't go with just one as they might answer that during the interview.</p> <p>It's likely you'll experience some setbacks and disappointments on the way but remaining positive and striving to improve every step of the way will only make you stronger.</p> <p><em>James Uffindell is chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.brightnetwork.co.uk/\">Bright Network</a>, an organisation that specialises in connecting sixth formers and first year undergraduates with over 200 leading recruiters.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Disability arts organisations and artists are hoping that London 2012 will increase the profile of their work and bring about lasting change to people's attitudes and preconceptions. These hopes are certainly not unfounded, with large-scale London 2012 showcases such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jun/26/prometheus-awakes-theatre-review\" title=\"\">Graeae's Prometheus Awakes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.motiondisabledunlimited.com/\" title=\"\">Motion Disabled: Unlimited</a> by Simon McKeown two good reasons to be cheerful.</p> <p>A lot is riding though on <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/new/london-2012/British-Council-Programme/programmes/Unlimited/\" title=\"\">the Unlimited programme</a>, a series of 29 commissions celebrating arts and culture by deaf and disabled artists, culminating in <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/festivals-series/unlimited\" title=\"\">an 11-day festival</a> at the Southbank Centre to coincide with the Paralympics.</p> <p>\"The UK is still leading in terms of appreciating and recognising its disabled artists,\" says Mark Williams, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/21/disability-arts-heart-n-soul-mark-williams-interview\" title=\"\">director of Heart n Soul,</a> the UK arts organisation with a learning disability aesthetic at its core. \"I think Unlimited is an amazing platform where that extra level of investment will enable artists to take the next step and show everyone what they can do.\"</p> <p>Heart n Soul was founded by Williams back in 1986, the year the phrase 'disability arts' was first coined and two years before the first official <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/sports/\" title=\"\">Paralympic Games</a> were held in Seoul. \"It was very much in the days when people with learning disabilities went to special schools and day centres and then died basically,\" explains Williams. \"There was no expectation that people could do anything apart from being cared for, and I was astonished at the lack of opportunities and how hidden everybody was.\"</p> <p>Times have changed. Pino Frumiento is a songwriter and one of Heart n Soul's first discoveries. In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/Heart_n_Soul_mbe\" title=\"\">he received an MBE</a> for services to songwriting within disability arts, while one of the company's latest talents, Dean Rodney, is a 21-year-old autistic man who will front a global band of 72 artists during the festival. Neither artist could be described as 'hidden'.</p> <p>\"It's pretty staggering that 26 years ago there was no expectation that people with learning disabilities could contribute culturally at all, and now we're at a stage where people are winning honours and fronting British Council international commissions across the world,\" Williams says.</p> <p>It's some leap, however, from greater visibility and opportunities for deaf and disabled artists to there being a level playing field with mainstream arts. Five years ago, the London Disability Arts Forum hosted a debate at Tate Modern with the motion: <a href=\"http://www.shapearts.org.uk/chronology-of-disability-arts/2004---2012/london-disability-arts-forum-debate-%E2%80%98should-disability-and-deaf-arts-be-dead-and-buried-in-the-21st-century%E2%80%99--.aspx\" title=\"\">\"Should disability and deaf arts be dead and buried in the 21st century?\"</a> It was defeated and found little support \u2013 to suggest we're all in the mainstream now is dangerously complacent.</p> <p>Playwright Kaite O'Reilly speaks of having two distinct careers: one in the mainstream, the other in disability arts and culture, with collaborators, audiences and media from each oblivious to her work \"on the other side\". Her play, <a href=\"http://nationaltheatrewales.org/whatson/performance/ntw20\" title=\"\">In Water I'm Weightless</a>, another London 2012 Unlimited commission, premiered in Cardiff earlier this month.</p> <p>\"Even in some contexts now there is still a patronising attitude,\" she reveals. \"We've had Q&amp;As after the performances and found some audience members actually surprised by the quality of the work, which is deeply patronising and in a way very depressing.\"</p> <p>She continues: \"It's great the Cultural Olympiad has given us this platform to show quite how good practitioners who happen to have an impairment are, but I hope it starts challenging people's preconceptions too. There's always this sense of the other, the assumption that people are not very experienced or clever, or that it's all about therapy. As I have an invisible impairment, I'm constantly confronted by the presumptions of audience members or industry people about what a disabled person is, and it certainly doesn't equate with my experience.\"</p> <p>O'Reilly is a veteran of the disability arts movement, starting out with Graeae in 1986 and believes her experience as an award winning playwright within mainstream programmes has allowed her to bring in work with disability content that would previously have been ghettoised. Take her 2008 piece with Sherman Cymru, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/mar/08/theatre\" title=\"\">The Almond and the Seahorse</a>, about the survivors of traumatic brain injuries. \"In it I challenged the usual representations of people who survive brain injury as tragic or as victims,\" she says. It was, in effect, a piece of disability art but was in the mainstream because I'd reached a standing and, like many of us, have been doing this for over 20 years. If you do something successfully enough for a long time, people will eventually start paying attention.\"</p> <p>The barriers to integration and acceptance for disability arts will not disappear overnight. While London 2012 does give grounds for optimism, it should come tempered with a sober reflection on the state of funding in the arts and the scale and extent of existing prejudices.</p> <p>For those not invited to the London 2012 party, there's resignation at the status quo. Ems Coombes, founder of Plymouth-based inclusive theatre company <a href=\"http://www.strictlycollaborative.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Strictly Collaborative</a>, believes any boost to disability arts \"will last 15 minutes, before the novelty wears off and it becomes a struggle again.\" With <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/14/disability-benefits-slashed-half-million\" title=\"\">cuts to disability living allowance</a> and arts funding, combined with a rate of employment of 48.8% in 2011, it's hardly a surprising view.</p> <p>Kaite O'Reilly talks of a tendency for theatres to cast non-disabled actors in the roles of disabled characters, a practice she calls \"cripping up\" and which she equates to white actors blacking up to play Othello. \"I hope the impact of Unlimited and the work that's been happening is that in time we will be as embarrassed about non-disabled people cripping up as we are now when we look back and see people blacking up,\" she says.</p> <p>Another hope is for the profile of London 2012 to spark enduring collaborations between disability arts organisations and mainstream players. With Heart n Soul this is already happening and the Paralympic year has already spurred new creative partnerships for Graeae too, which in time may help them reach new audiences, as well as stimulate their own artistic practices.</p> <p>After the phenomenal performances of British women in the Olympics, some have asked if their success will lead to wholesale changes in attitudes towards female athletes. The hope is something similar will happen in disability arts, with a new generation inspired by role models such as Dean Rodney, and for the fear of the other to start melting away.</p> <p>\"As it is, it's still seen as something that's worthy or unusual or weird,\" O'Reilly laments. \"But I really do hope in time it will just be part of that great wonderful human variety; a celebration of all that's possible.\"</p> <p><em>Russell Parton is a freelance arts writer \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/russparton\" title=\"\"><em>@russparton</em></a><em>. </em><a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/festivals-series/unlimited\" title=\"\"><em>Unlimited runs at the Southbank Centre</em></a><em> from 30 August to 9 September</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Housing associations are at a cross roads. Gone are the \"good old days\" when the path ahead was obvious. While we used to be sheltered from market risks and business perils by generous funding arrangements and a healthy dose of benign regulation, these have now been taken away and we must to step forward and accept responsibility for determining our own destiny.</p> <p>I don't foresee a return to the days of milk and honey. The scale of cuts required in public expenditure will not be achieved by simply trimming budgets and deferring discretionary spending. Structural and seismic shifts will be required in the way we operate. I also don't think society has yet fully understood or appreciated the impact and consequences our growing and ageing population; it will change expectations, demands and the affordability of traditional patterns of care and support.</p> <p>Hanover is a leading provider of extra care services, which combine accommodation and living space with access to a social care, catering and more. This can provide a great alternative to residential care \u2013 but it is also an expensive option that has required high levels of grant funding and a substantial commitment to service costs. The public pound would not stretch very far even if social care was the only thing commissioned and provided.</p> <p>Housing leaders need to think of ways to offer alternative and better housing options to older people \u2013 even before they need care and support \u2013 encouraging them to plan ahead for later life while freeing up a rich source of under-occupied family properties. We cannot wait for grant funding to be provided to allow us to do this.</p> <p>Like several other housing associations, Hanover is taking a bold step out of its comfort zone and preparing to compete in a commercial environment against private housebuilders and residential developers for both land and a share of today's property market.</p> <p>Cross subsidising from commercial development will increasingly become the norm by which housing associations provide new affordable housing over the next few years. This strategy though is not without risks. Even with a strong track record of innovation and development combined with a secure financial base and balance sheet this will still require a leap of faith. To succeed we will need to be even more creative, brave and agile than we have been before.</p> <p>What we mustn't lose sight of in this process is our commitment to quality and the social values that we hold dear. All of our new housing should be build to Happi (Housing our Aging Population: Panel for Innovation) standards and principles. At Hanover, this will demonstrate our commitment to larger space standards, imaginative designs, quality fixtures, fittings and finishes, together with genuinely integrated living that will set us apart from alternative offerings from the private sector.</p> <p>Different housing organisations may make different choices about the preferred route ahead of them. But what we must all strive to do is make informed, positive choices, not find ourselves left waiting and wondering which way to turn.</p> <p><em>Bruce Moore is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.hanover.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Hanover Housing</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>latest job vacancies</strong></a><strong> direct</strong></p>",
  "<p>On the face of it, there is not a great deal in common between where I work, <a href=\"http://www.mountschoolyork.co.uk/\">The Mount School York</a>, an independent secondary school for girls, and the grand old man of angry American humour, the late <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin\">George Carlin</a>.</p> <p>But I found myself thinking of one of Carlin's most famous social commentaries when I was trying to work out how best to explain why The Mount has become the first school in England to include <a href=\"http://www.peacejam.org.uk/\">PeaceJam</a> in our formal education curriculum.</p> <p>Clad all in black, with those wired, angry eyes, Carlin stared out into the audience and told a most inconvenient truth:</p> <p>\"Where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality \u2026 This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders.\"</p> <p>I am not saying that I agree with his words, but they led me to make a link with the words I heard spoken at the PeaceJam conference which took place at Bradford University in April. Watching 300 young people listen, transfixed, to the words of Nobel Peace Laureate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_P%C3%A9rez_Esquivel\">Adolfo Perez Esquivel</a>, was an experience that I am sure they will never forget. An old man who looked just like someone's grandfather chatting to them about his days as one of the 'Disappeared' in Argentina was poignant enough, but it was his views on education that really affected me. \"What is the point of educating a person to become an engineer or a doctor,\" he said, \"if they do not have a critical consciousness?\"</p> <p>When you see the collapse of basic values that has unpicked the very heart of this country, you can see how challenging it is for today's teachers to stand in front of their class and pretend everything is alright out there and project to these young, hopeful idealists that the grown ups can say with confidence: \"we know what we are doing\".</p> <p>The world in which we live is not an easy one and our pupils need to know that. How can we educate pupils to not only cope with the ever-changing politics of world events that directly affect them and those at a more local level, but to also care, to want to be involved, with this critical consciousness Perez discussed?</p> <p>Carlin's nihilistic response was to remove himself from the political process altogether and he famously last cast a vote in 1972, backing the doomed presidential bid of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern\">George McGovern</a>. His thinking was, if you vote you have no right to complain.</p> <p>At The Mount School we have taken a different path. Perhaps that's The Mount's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers\">Quaker</a> ethos shining through. Our school prepares young girls for the future. The girls look to us, as knowing more than they do: we are passing on to them not just how-to-pass-exams-information but what we might rather grandly hope to call wisdom or life lessons.</p> <p>And this is where the PeaceJam curriculum comes in. To put it in the words of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jody_Williams\">Jody Williams</a>, the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize laureate: \"Emotion, without action, is irrelevant.\"</p> <p>Williams is one of several Nobel laureates who have come together to create the PeaceJam Foundation's educational programme that gives young people the awareness, skills and the requisite confidence to take effective, peaceful action to make a difference in their own lives and the wider community.</p> <p>Already a popular after-school activity or club in many parts of the country, The Mount is now the first school in England to bring the PeaceJam Ambassador's curriculum into our sixth form looking specifically at ideas surrounding peace, violence, social justice and oppression, as part of our overall ethos of global thinking, encompassing everything the girls do that isn't linked to their A-level studies. The curriculum, based on a triangle of education, inspiration and action aims to encourage young people to create and implement their own <a href=\"http://www.peacejam.org/gcachallenge.aspx\">Global Call to Action Projects</a>, becoming creative leaders who are committed to solving the most difficult problems facing our world.</p> <p>What does this mean for the future?</p> <p>Charlotte Stockton, 18, from York was in the first intake to benefit from the PeaceJam connection. She told me: \"I have had the chance to not only learn about, but also hear two Nobel Peace Laureates speak since Easter \u2013 Adolfo Perez Esquivel [1980 Nobel Peace Prize] and His Holiness the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama\">Dalai Lama</a>.</p> <p>\"Because of these fantastic opportunities, I have been able to see the links between their inspirational messages, particularly the emphasis on the need for open-mindedness and dialogue throughout the world, to avoid conflicts and work towards a peaceful 21st century.\"</p> <p>This is education as it should be; a holistic experience, enabling pupils to achieve beyond what they ever thought they could, while developing their own critical consciousness for a globalised world.</p> <p><em>Jo Hayward worked as a transport consultant in London before doing her PGCE at Leeds University.
