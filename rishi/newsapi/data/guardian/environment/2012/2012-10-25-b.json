It doesn't matter as the Tigers couldn't do anything against the Giants' Madison Bumgarner or their bullpen. The Giants have won their first two home games, so now it's almost imperative that the Detroit Tigers win all of their home games if they want to win this series down 0-2.</p> <p>The next game? That will be Saturday night at Comerica Park in Detroit, 8:00pm EST. The planned matchup pits the Giants' best pitcher Ryan Vogelsong against the Tigers' number three starter Anibal Sanchez. Enjoy a day off of baseball and then we'll have coverage here at the Guardian starting 7:30pm EST. That will do it from me, thank to everyone for following along with us tonight and a special thanks to everybody who has contributed.

Romo throws a fastball strike at the knee, maybe a tad generous call, but it's 2-1. Romo throws a slider, missing his spot, but getting a strike call. 2-2.

Instead, Smyly is staying out there, after walking the leadoff hitter on four straight pitches and facing the NLCS MVP.</p> <p>You know, as much as I hate pitching changes, maybe this isn't wise?</p> <p>Scutaro takes the first pitch, which makes sense, but it's a strike. Scutaro then bunts the second pitch foul. 0-2. Maybe the strategy was to confuse Marco here? What an odd move there. Pagan is making like he's about to run, but Smyly's not really focusing, he throws ball one to a taking Scuatro.</p> <p>The next pitch? Scutaro hits a long ball that hooks just about eight feet foul. Still 1-2. Now Smyly throws to first, but Pagan gets back safely. Smyly's 1-2 pitch is a fastball down the middle that he would probably want back.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5089f92695cb4897f0db5383\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T02:44:54.796Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tigers 0 - Giants 1, Bottom 8th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Drew Smyly is still in the game, somewhat surprisingly, while Andy Dirks stays in the game to play right field. Smyly's in to face Angel Pagan, at the very least, Smyly's command still isn't very command-y as he falls behind 3-0 to Pagan. Make that 4-0.

He hit three home runs in three at-bats, the first two against Justin Verlander (the de facto greatest pitcher in the known universe) before ending his night with a mere single in his last at bat of the evening. At that point his team had a comfortable lead over the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the World Series, a game that<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/25/detroit-tigers-san-francisco-giants-world-series-game-1-live\"> the San Francisco Giants would end up winning 8-3 </a>after Jhonny Peralta hit a last gasp home run in the ninth inning.</p> <p>Maybe the most surprising story is that Barry Zito managed to out-pitch Justin Verlander in the first game of the World Series. Maybe this <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8526051/barry-zito-nlcs-game-5-masterpiece-sends-series-back-san-francisco\">#RallyZito thing</a> does have some unexplainable spell-like qualities, or maybe Barry Zito is slipping something into the drinks of his opponents like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFV1SVTYeuE\">Ryan O'Reilly in \"Oz\"</a>. In any case, tonight's pitching matchup seems a lot more even than yesterday's suspected mismatch that went the other way.

Yes I'm well aware how dirty that sounds, but let's at least attempt to be adults here.</p> <p>You know when they say \"it's an all-new ballgame\"? Well, tonight it's an all-new ballgame, quite literally. There are seven games, and nobody is expecting a sweep in any direction. All of those runs that the Giants scored last game? Well they don't carry over into tonight's matchup. A win tonight by the Tigers would effectively take away the Giants' not insignificant home court advantage (this crowd is loud). Even if the Giants do win tonight, all they will have done is what they're supposed to have done.</p> <p>(In other words, for those of us who predicted the Tigers to win in six? Well, it's still possible. Which reminds me, there's still time to read both my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/24/world-series-tigers-giants-everything-you-need-to-know\">utterly ridiculous World Series preview</a> and David Lengel's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/23/world-series-tigers-giants-preview\">rather more useful and coherent one</a>. They will both be outdated, perhaps laughably so, in about a week. So don't hesitate. It's that or listen to the FOX pregame chatter, your choice.)</p> <p>Can the Detroit Tigers come back from an unexpectedly rough Game 1?

  "<p>The New York Times has reported an 11% increase in paid-for digital subscriptions to almost 600,000 in the three months to the end of September.</p> <p>However, both print and digital advertising at the paper suffered year-on-year declines. The Times reported a small profit of $2.28m (\u00a31.4m) in the third quarter. Digital subscriptions rose 11% between the second and third quarters to 592,000 with Arthur Sulzberger Jr, chairman and chief executive of the New York Times Company, saying that digital subscription trends have \"remained robust\".</p> <p>A breakdown shows that paid subscribers to the New York Times and its sister paper, the International Herald Tribune, amounted to 566,000, an increase of 57,000 or 11%, quarter on quarter. Paid subscribers to the NYT-owned Boston Globe were 26,000 at the end of the third quarter, up 3,000 or 13% compared with the previous three months.</p> <p>\"While our results for the third quarter reflect continued pressure on advertising revenues, total circulation revenues rose led by the expansion of our digital subscription base,\" Sulzberger said. Total revenue fell 0.6% year on year to $449m as the tough advertising market continues to batter the publishing company.</p> <p>Total advertising revenues fell 8.9% year on year in the third quarter to $182m. Print advertising at the company's newspapers, slumped by 10.9% year on year in the third quarter.</p> <p>Digital revenues fell 2.2% year on year to $44.6m mainly because of lower national display and property ads. Digital ad revenues account for 24.4% of total ad revenues.</p> <p>The publisher said this was \"largely due to the challenging economic environment, ongoing secular trends and an increasingly complex and fragmented digital advertising marketplace\".</p> <p>Circulation revenues increased a healthy 7.4% year-on-year to $234m, thanks to print cover price increases and growth in digital subscriptions.</p> <p>The company said that it expects circulation revenues to increase in the \"mid to high single digits\" in the final three months of 2012 thanks to the growth in digital subscribers and print price increases.</p> <p>Ad revenue declines are expected to be about the same in the fourth quarter as they were in the three months to the end of September.</p> <p>The company said it had completed the sale of how-to web operation About Group for $300m.<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Economists and business leaders are fond of pinpointing world events and trends to explain a dip in growth or profits. But never before have grey swans been singled out.</p> <p>On Thursday Sir Martin Sorrell, Britain's leading ad man, cut the full-year forecast for his WPP agency for the second time in two months, warning that a number of \"grey swans\" in the global economy are causing clients of the world's largest marketing, advertising and PR company to cut spending.</p> <p>In an allusion to unpredictable black swan events, Sorrell's grey swans are issues that are known about \u2013 with the most troublesome ones being the health of the US economy, what happens after the presidential election on 6 November and the country's \"fiscal cliff, deficit and indebtedness\".</p> <p>Sorrell cited the others as the eurozone crisis, turmoil in the Middle East and a slowdown in fast-growing economies such as China, Brazil and India. \"There seem to be four grey swans,\" he added. \"Grey because we know about them. By definition, we do not know the black ones.\" He added: \"The US presidential election has resulted, yet again, in kicking the can down the road. Fears remain that whoever wins will be unable to deal with these issues given a deadlocked Congress.\"</p> <p>He added it should be remembered that in the real world of the consumer there is a risk of a \"lost decade\" of downturn. \"While the markets may feel better about things, given the recent rounds of quantitative easing and printing money, the real world remains concerned and braced for slow overall growth and a lost decade which we may be halfway through in western Europe,\" he said. His words came as WPP reported a disappointing 1.9% rise in like-for-like revenue growth of \u00a32.5bn in the three months to the end of September.</p> <p>Some of the blame was apportioned to the London Olympics and Euro 2012 football championships failing to live up to advertising expectations. Analysts had been expecting growth closer to levels seen in the first half of the year \u2013 when WPP's revenues were up 3.6% year-on-year.</p> <p>WPP cut its full year annual growth forecast to between 2.5% and 3% \u2013 up until the end of August Sorrell had talked of 4%.</p> <p>Revenue growth went into reverse at WPP's PR and research operations, which include TNS and Hill &amp; Knowlton and Cohn &amp; Wolfe, which contracted by 1.7% in the third quarter.</p> <p>Sorrell blamed the US presidential election which meant that many clients had decided to hold off on running public affairs campaigns until the outcome is known.</p> <p>Advertising remained the strongest performer for WPP, although Sorrell said that big events that usually attract huge advertising had not fuelled growth as expected.</p> <p>The Olympic effect may not have delivered globally, but it did in the UK with revenues up a healthy 4.7% in the third quarter. This was well ahead of WPP's previous forecast and the 3.5% delivered in the second quarter. Revenued in the rest of the world grew by 6.8%.</p> <p>Sorrell also said that WPP's latest forecasts showed a further slowing in revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The slowdown was particularly marked in North America, continental Europe and Latin America. He expressed concern that there are no major events to help fuel growth next year.</p> <p>He said that 2014 \"looks a better prospect\" with the World Cup in Brazil, the Winter Olympics in Sochi and the mid-term congressional elections in the US likely to boost advertising spending.</p> <p>WPP expects to make more than $100m (\u00a362m) from the sale of its stake in Buddy Media and the sale of the Madison avenue New York headquarters of advertising agency network Young &amp; Rubicam. The company paid $5m in 2010 for its stake in Buddy Media, a social media branding specialist.</p> <p> </p>",

  "<p>This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. It was with those words, delivered almost 70 years ago to the day, that Winston Churchill greeted news of Montgomery's victory at El Alamein, a turning point in the second world war.</p> <p>The Conservative party can never get too much of Churchill, so there will be many in the blue half of the coalition who will be hoping that the words are as appropriate for describing the state of the economy today as they were for outlining the global balance of power in late 1942.</p> <p>Make no mistake, news that Britain's economy grew by 1% in the third quarter of 2012 does not mark the end of the downturn that began more than five years ago, even though it is tremendous morale booster for a government that has had its back to the wall in recent months.</p> <p>The Treasury and the Bank of England know the performance of the economy was flattered by one-off factors in the period between July and September, resulting in growth figures that are less good than they look. Over the past 12 months, national output has been flat and remains 3% lower than it was in early 2008. Recovery has been weaker and slower than in any cycle for which reliable records exist, including the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>It will take another year of robust growth simply to return the economy to where it was during the period of phoney war between the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year later, and a decade to make up even half the output lost over the past four and a half years. The level of gross domestic product is 13-14% below where it would have been had growth continued at its pre-recession trend of 2.5% a year. Some of that has been lost for good: it will never be recovered.</p> <p>Nor is any minister, least of all George Osborne, willing to say that this is the beginning of the end. There are simply too many things that could wrong \u2013 at home and abroad \u2013 to make that boast with confidence. Not only did the announcement by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/ford-1300-job-cuts-plants-dagenham-southampton\" title=\"\">Ford that it was closing two UK plants </a>take the shine off the GDP announcement, it also underscored the fragility of the productive wing of the economy.</p> <p>Ford's decision chimes with recent business surveys, most of which offered warning signs about a fresh period of weakness in the final three months of 2012. The year started on a weak note, with consumers hammered by high inflation and exports hit by the deepening crisis in the eurozone.</p> <p>In the second quarter, the economy was broadly flat but looked worse than it actually was due to the extra bank holiday granted for the Queen's diamond jubilee. That accounted for all of the 0.4% drop in GDP, and perhaps a little more.</p> <p>Similarly, the third quarter figures released yesterday overstate the strength of the economy, in part because output lost in June was made up in the next two months and in part because there was a boost to growth from the Olympics. The Office for National Statistics estimates that one-fifth of the growth in the last quarter was the result of ticket sales for the Games, but the GDP data also shows an Olympic effect in very strong performance by shops, hotels and restaurants.</p> <p>Overall, output of the service sector \u2013 which accounts for 80% of the economy \u2013 expanded by 1.3% in the third quarter and is now above its pre-recession peak. That is an impressive performance but is unlikely to be repeated soon. As Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting pointed out, the increase in service sector output during the third quarter of 2012 alone was greater than in the entire period between the Beijing Olympics of 2008 and the second quarter of this year.</p> <p>Wisely, Osborne was careful not to claim the third quarter growth figures as a turning point. The economy remains fundamentally weak, particularly when it comes to exports and investment, the sectors vital for the rebalancing sought by the government. More demand will be sucked out of the economy in 2013 and 2014 than in 2012 as the chancellor's fiscal tightening intensifies. This will be against the backdrop of a global economy in which there is a deepening recession in the eurozone, slowing growth in China and uncertainty about what will happen to the US economy after the presidential election. As things stand, America will wake up on January 1 next year to tax increases and spending cuts worth 4% of GDP, enough to plunge the entire global economy back into recession.</p> <p>Why, then, might this be the end of the beginning? First, there was some genuine growth in the third quarter, even if it was much less than the headline figure suggested. Consumer spending is gently rising, encouraged by falling inflation, compensation payments by banks for mis-sold payment protection insurance and, notwithstanding the Ford job losses, a diminishing threat of unemployment. For the past four years, the Bank of England has been trying to get the economy moving, through record low interest rates, \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing and, more recently its Funding for Lending Scheme. It may be starting to work.</p> <p>There are two other reasons for ministers to be cautiously optimistic. Recessions, even the deep and damaging ones that result from financial crises, don't last for ever. At least, none have until now.</p> <p>Second, the international outlook may be about to improve. America is unlikely to leap off the \"fiscal cliff\" whoever wins next month's election; China's economy appears to be stabilising and there are signs Europe is getting to grips with its problems. Better global news coupled with a pick-up in consumer spending at home may be enough to persuade businesses to take some of their investment projects out of mothballs, providing a second leg to the recovery.</p> <p>Ministers are not banking on any of this. Even in the absence of bad news from the global economy, there is a risk the economy will continue to bump along the bottom. Strong growth in the UK is normally associated with periods when real (inflation adjusted) incomes are rising strongly, and for now prices are still rising faster than wages - albeit by less than they were a year ago. The banking system remains impaired and the housing market will remain in the doldrums until first-time buyers can secure mortgages.</p> <p>This looks the most likely scenario. There is, of course, another possibility: a fresh downturn that would push the UK into an unprecedented triple dip recession. For that to happen, something would have to go seriously wrong over the coming months. Worryingly for ministers, the history of this recession suggests that if something can go wrong, it will.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2102.

  "<p>MPs have voted to abandon the controversial badger cull in England entirely, inflicting an embarrassing defeat on ministers who had already been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/badger-cull-postponed-2013\" title=\"\">forced to postpone the start of the killing</a> until next summer.</p> <p>The motion in parliament to stop the cull was passed by 147 votes to just 28.</p> <p>The debate in the Commons on Thursday gave MPs the first opportunity to vote on the cull, which was intended to curb bovine tuberculosis in cattle.</p> <p>However, the government is not legally bound by the vote and could still press on regardless.</p> <p>The shadow environment secretary, Mary Creagh, said after the debate: \"The government should now come clean with the public and farmers and declare that the cull will not now go ahead. It is not fair for farmers to be strung along, and the public have shown that they will not accept a badger cull.\"</p> <p>David Heath, the Liberal MP for Somerton and Frome, who is also the farming minister, made a forceful defence of the cull during the debate.</p> <p>He said: \"We cannot afford to shy away from tackling the rampant spread of TB throughout our cattle herds. None of [the opponents] \u2013 not the critics, not scientists, not politicians \u2013 have come up with a single workable alternative to the cull which would give us the positive impact we need right now.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/16/badger-cull-commons-debate\" title=\"\">debate had been granted after more than 150,000 people signed</a> an official government e-petition \u2013 an innovation that had been launched by Heath.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, was present for 20 minutes of the five-hour debate. Several Labour MPs reported that he said \"I can't stand any more of this\" as he walked out of the discussion.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/2012/10/25/owen-paterson-accused-of-badger-debate-snub/\" title=\"\">Paterson said later</a>: \"I didn't storm in or out anywhere. As I left I might have joked about the ill-informed comments of the other side.\"</p> <p>During the debate, Sir Jim Paice, who lost the farming minister's post in September's reshuffle, said that he and other ministers were under \"special security measures due to threats from animal-rights extremists\".</p> <p>He also commented on the shooting of free-running badgers. The killing method marked a key difference between the government's proposals and the evidence arising from a landmark \u00a350m, 10-year culling trial, in which 11,000 badgers were captured in cages then shot with pistols.</p> <p>Paice said: \"Nobody knows if controlled shooting will cull 70% of badgers [the minimum required] or be humane. There is no science, I readily admit that, because it has never been done.\"</p> <p>He said that the now-postponed pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire had to go ahead to \"test free shooting\".</p> <p>But other MPs quoted eminent scientists who argue that killing badgers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">killing could well increase TB infections in cattle</a> as infected animals flee the killing zone.</p> <p>The lost vote means a problem for ministers if they decide to push on with the cull, as they risk being accused of ignoring the will of parliament.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, said \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/24/prisoners-vote-david-cameron\" title=\"\">parliament is sovereign</a>\" in the matter of whether the European court of human rights could force the UK to give prisoners the vote. Ministers would need to argue that parliament was not sovereign in the case of the badger cull, or possibly call another vote and whip MPs hard to ensure a victory.</p> <p>Before the vote, Heath was asked by Tory MP Mark Pritchard: \"Will ministers accept the will of this house?\" Heath said they would \"listen\" to the views of the house.</p> <p>Opponents of the cull welcomed the government defeat. Mark Jones at Humane Society International said: \"The government has refused to listen to the majority of scientists, disease experts and the British people opposed to the cull. Surely now it must listen to the will of the parliament and abandon its policy for good \u2026 and stop wasting time and money on a politically motivated badger hunt.\"</p> <p>Gavin Grant, chief executive of the RSPCA, said: \"We stand ready to play a full part in working with farmers, land owners, the government and conservationists to move forward rapidly and constructively to tackle this dire disease in cattle and wildlife [using vaccination].\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2012.

  "<p>Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, toured broadcast studios this afternoon in an effort to demonstrate that the BBC is in control of the Savile crisis after cross-party criticism of the performance of the broadcaster's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/jimmy-savile-bbc-director-general-faces-mps-live\" title=\"\">director general in front of MPs on Tuesday morning</a>.</p> <p>But if anything the peer only seemed to heighten the tension surrounding the corporation, telling ITV News that he would be \"not surprised\" if there were resignations at the BBC - and telling Sky News that George Entwistle, the director general, and others involved \"have legitimate questions to answer\".</p> <p>Deploying colorful language guaranteed to get him a visible airing in the next day's newspapers, Patten told the BBC's World At One that Entwistle, who started in his job in mid September, has been deluged with a \"tsunami of filth\" which had done \"terrible damage\" to the standing of the broadcaster.</p> <p>His surprisingly frank admissions come as Patten is coming under pressure to get a grip on the scandal, now running well into its fourth week, and as the BBC finds itself light on political allies. Criticisms made by Maria Miller on Tuesday and again on Wednesday that the BBC was not in control, are privately echoed by her Labour opposite number Harriet Harman.</p> <p>Paul Farrelly, a Labour member of the culture media and sport select committee, said that Entwistle \"had not demonstrated so far\" that \"he can take a grip\", amid signs that politicians are queuing up to take aim at the broadcaster - although there was some qualified support from Labour leader Ed Miliband who when asked on a visit to Preston yesterday said that he did not think that Entwistle should quit over the crisis.</p> <p>There are few senior executives at the BBC able to defend the corporation, partly because so many are under fire for their role in the handling of an aborted Newsnight investigation into Savile, and partly because Entwistle's ascent has left the broadcaster with more key roles to fill.</p> <p>Meanwhile, former senior staff believe that the BBC's new leadership is struggling. One, who asked not to be named, contrasted the situation with the Russell Brand - Jonathan Ross prank calls affair in 2008 - where within a week of public outrage beginning Russell Brand and the controller of Radio 2 Lesley Douglas had both quit. Ross, meanwhile, was forced to serve a period of suspension.</p> <p>Even Patten himself conceded he was overwhelmed. He said that the situation was nothing like any of those he had experienced before in his long political career, which has encompassed being Conservative party chairman, a cabinet minister and the last British governor of Hong Kong, overseeing its handover to China. \"I don't think I've ever before been in one that felt like being washed over by a political reputational tsunami,\" he told ITV.</p> <p>Asked specifically if Entwistle would have to resign by ITV News he said: \"Steady on. It's difficult enough answering real time questions on this \u2013 I'm extremely reluctant to argue too many 'what if' questions but what is undoubtedly the case is the Trust appointed the present DG, he seemed to us to be the best candidate for the job. His appointment was widely praised, not only within BBC.\"</p> <p>But for all the doubts about Entwistle, and for all the public anger that Savile was allowed to get away with his sexual abuse for so long, the BBC has not yet seen the kind of political pressure seen at the time of Ross-Brand, where the looming general election and the political muscle of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation created an environment in which lapses in taste were linked to failures in the entire model of BBC governance, its Trust regulator, and the former chairman Sir Michael Lyons.</p> <p>Lyons, who was a Labour councillor before he became a local government executive, who chose not to stand for a second term, was disliked acutely by the Conservatives, and in particular former culture secretary Jeremy Hunt. But Patten was this government's appointment, giving him some personal insulation, while the BBC is at a relatively secure point in its own administrative cycle because the next royal charter is not due for renewal until 2016 and the next licence fee settlement is not due until a year after.</p>",
  "<p>There goes the last remnant of a better era. Farming minister <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/17/10/2012/135768/DEFRA-consults-over-Wages-Board-abolition.htm\" title=\"\">David Heath announced the abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board</a>, the last of the old wages councils. There are just four weeks of \"consultation\" before farm workers lose this special protection. The rest of the wages councils were eviscerated by Margaret Thatcher and axed by John Major in 1993, ending an era when governments saw endemic low pay as their concern.</p> <p>In the old days, the sectors with workers at most risk of exploitation had their own wages councils, with representatives of employers and workers fixing pay and conditions, mindful of what an industry could bear. Hairdressing, catering, retail, laundry and tailoring had some of the lowest-paid and most vulnerable workers. Wages councils were founded in 1909, the year of the Liberal government's radical People's Budget, with its unprecedented taxes on the wealthy. What a sad paradox that, in their first return to government since Lloyd George, Heath, a Liberal Democrat, is killing off the last wages council.</p> <p>His press release is headed: \"Getting rid of outdated labour restrictions will mean more jobs.\" These days certain killer words flash out instant red alerts: \"reform\", \"flexible\", \"harmonise\" and \"modernise\" all signify their opposites. Heath's \"plans to modernise the agricultural labour market\" mean taking farm workers back in time. His plan for them to be \"harmonised with the rest of the economy\" won't feel harmonious when it \"leads to a more flexible labour market\" to \"end an anomaly requiring farmers to follow outdated and bureaucratic rules\".</p> <p>Farm work is not noted for good pay and conditions. It is still one of the most dangerous occupations with a high accident rate. Isolated, under-unionised, with little choice of other work, a third of agricultural workers live in tied housing, exceptionally vulnerable to the whims of employers. That's why their wages council was allowed to survive when the others were scrapped. Their current minimum pay, which is legally enforced, is just 2p an hour above the national minimum. But the board also sets sick pay, holiday pay and a graded pay progression, important when so many work on small farms with little chance of promotion. The board ordains other conditions, such as warm clothing, essential for outdoor work. It sets a pay rate and age for child pickers, who will lose all protection from now on. (Nine-year-olds were discovered picking spring onions from dawn till dusk in freezing weather in Worcestershire last year.) The board sets fair rents for tied housing \u2013 \u00a328 a week for a caravan \u2013 but there will be no rent limits from now on.</p> <p>Richard Neville, a union member, drives a tractor on a Sussex farm. His farm-working parents were veterans of the last battle in 1976 over security in tied housing. \"Wages are bound to fall back. The board fixes overtime rates at time and a half: we'll lose that, though sometimes we're doing 20 or 30 extra hours a week. There's a lot of poverty in these rural areas, because costs are high, but people don't see it.\" Labour's <a href=\"http://www.marycreagh.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mary Creagh</a>, shadow environment secretary, is fighting to save the board. \"Those who pick the apples should be able to afford to buy them,\" she says, watching the rise in rural poverty: \"The most picturesque market towns now have food banks.\" One chance of reprieve comes from the Welsh assembly, which claims they have the right to prevent the board's abolition in Wales \u2013 though Defra denies that's within its powers: lawyers are at work on both sides.</p> <p>Heath is right on this: the idea of a statutory board with legal enforcement officers, ordering employers to provide footwear and clothing to their workers, giving them three days' extra holiday, better sick leave on full pay and graded pay rates, does seem an oddly outdated anomaly. In a free market, why would the state intervene? Back in the 1970s workers' pay, rights and conditions were the stuff of politics. In those fractious times, unions' struggle to keep members' pay from falling far behind sky-rocketing inflation led to head-on confrontation with governments trying to hold inflation down. As the prices and incomes board strove to arbitrate, the net result was pay scales that made this country more equal than it had ever been in history \u2013 or will be again on the present trajectory. But all that was blown away spectacularly in the 1980s, as boardrooms turned kleptocrat. Within a few years the number of poor children shot up from one in seven to one in three, where it has stayed \u2013 and it will now worsen.</p> <p>This week ONS figures reveal that real living standards have fallen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/23/uk-wellbeing-fails-to-recover-financial-crisis\" title=\"\">by more than 13% since 2008</a> \u2013 but that virtually meaningless average hides a gigantic difference between high and low earners, as useful as averaging Zimbabwe and Manhattan. Resolution Foundation figures show that the incomes of the bottom half of households have stagnated ever since 2003: without change, stagnation is the new norm and recovery won't help. At \u00a36.19, the real value of the national minimum wage has fallen back to 2004 levels. Everything this government does conspires to depress low incomes further, with cuts in credits and housing benefit as wages still fall behind high food and fuel inflation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/14/statutory-london-living-wage-ed-miliband\" title=\"\">Labour contemplates the living wage</a>, currently set at \u00a37.20. Labour councils urge public and private employers to sign up. It's a great gesture when organisations do sign up, but it costs little for banks, local councils, KPMG or anyone else employing few minimum-wage staff. So far no large employer of the low-paid has signed up: no hotel, care home or catering chain, no supermarket, cleaning company or security guard provider. Voluntaryism isn't enough.</p> <p>Labour should use its fight to save the Agricultural Wages Board to think again about the old wages councils. Bringing in the minimum wage was one of Labour's best achievements \u2013 but a single rate across all industries will always be a lowest common denominator, rising only at the pace of the most precarious sector. Market conditions in hairdressing, sandwich-making and care homes are unconnected. A fair rate set for each industry would help to keep wages up, avoiding the risk that the minimum wage is the norm, not a rock-bottom backstop. Wages councils could restore some of the best spirit of the postwar settlement, when the state did intervene on pay.</p>",
  "<p>Another government shambles. There's a new one every day. This time they've lost Henry I. Sir Tony Baldry, the MP who represents the Church Commissioners, spoke to the Commons about the bones of Richard III. MPs have been fighting over who gets the mortal remains recently discovered under a car park in Leicester, if they prove to belong to the late king. (How do the scientists decide? I know the skeleton is hunchbacked, and there are axe wounds to the head, but have they found a crown with a few hairs stuck to it for the crucial DNA test?)</p> <p>As various MPs suggested that Richard should be interred in their constitutency (if it is him, he is likely to wind up under Leicester Cathedral), Sir Tony said in a baffled sort of way that he had been worried about how many other kings have vanished, \"but the only one who is still missing is Henry I, who seems to have got lost somewhere in Reading.\"</p> <p>Can't this lot get anything right? Losing your growth targets is one thing; losing a king, and in Reading of all places, quite another. Or take the badger cull, now postponed till next year. At least. The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, was assailed by all sides over this U-turn. He coped by shouting very loud. We had to \"bear down on wildlife\". He meant \"bear down on the disease in wildlife,\" but that's not what he said.</p> <p>Indeed, he seemed to be distracted throughout. MPs pointed out that bovine TB might be reduced by 23% in the area of the cull, but around the cull \u2013 no doubt where badgers scarper when things get too hot at home \u2013 the figures were up by 28%.</p> <p>I got the impression Mr Paterson had been poorly briefed, possibly by a senior civil servant who doesn't much like him. Or who had a secret passion for the outgoing minister, Caroline Spelman. The new secretary of state even looks a bit like Jim Hacker, as played by Paul Eddington in Yes, Minister. Like Hacker he tends to get flustered. Several times he confused bellowing with logical argument.</p> <p>I had a rumination about how the chaps in Whitehall might handle their new man. Take the Defra campaign for \"ugly vegetables\". They want to persuade people that veggies don't have to be perfectly shaped; if people were willing to eat peculiar looking food they might save a lot of money. A junior minister, David Heath, declared \"ugly veg is still tasty veg!\"</p> <p>The scene is in the Defra office. Sir Humphrey is holding up a bulgy celeriac. \"Take this one, minister. It resembles a pregnant octopus. Perfect for our campaign, I think.\"</p> <p>Bernard chips in. \"We've had a call from Esther Rantzen. She's sending over a parsnip with a dangly bit that looks rather like a willy. Makes our point rather well.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, minister,\" says Sir Humphrey, as smooth as black velvet, \"if you hold up this carrot up to the light at this angle, you might see Jimmy Savile's face.\"</p> <p>Paterson: \"Aaargh!\"</p> <p>No wonder Labour's Kerry McCarthy tweeted that she had seen him storm out of the Chamber, saying: \"I can't stand any more of this!\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2012 because the original described Kerry McCarthy as male. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The ornithological metaphor seems wrong. Shouldn't a grey swan, which we know doesn't exist, describe an imaginary risk rather than a known and real risk?</p> <p>Never mind. Sir Martin Sorrell's broad point seems correct: there was definitely something in the water in September, a flat month for WPP to complete its weakest quarter for revenue growth since the first three months of 2010.</p> <p>Sorrell's thesis that his and others' clients suddenly became more cautious rings true. The 1% rise in UK GDP in the third quarter, then, says little about the wider corporate picture. Sorrell's four beasts provoking fear in boardrooms are the eurozone crisis; political tensions in the Middle East; concern about the state of the Chinese economy; and the deficit, debt and fiscal cliff in the US.</p> <p>None of those worries is new, of course. The point is that they are looming larger and are already affecting corporate spending and behaviour. 2012 has been a year of deteriorating expectations. At the start of the year UK plc, meaning the complete set of quoted companies, was forecast to post a combined 5% increase in earnings; now, a fall of a greater magnitude is pencilled in. Similarly, the current crop of third-quarter earnings reports in the US is yielding many disappointments, from Google to McDonald's to Du Pont.</p> <p>Sorrell identifies the US as the biggest risk. That, too, seems correct since the fiscal cliff \u2013 the raft of tax increases and spending cuts that will be implemented in January unless Congress agrees a different path \u2013 has the potential to do serious damage to the global economy.</p> <p>Lombard Street Research ran the numbers through its \"fiscal cliffometer\" this week and concluded that a tightening worth 2.6% of US GDP would produce growth of just 0.4% in the US in 2013, a contraction of almost 2% in the eurozone and growth of 4.5% in China. \"I'm not an equity strategist, but I'd suggest current stock prices don't properly discount that scenario,\" commented Lombard's Dario Perkins dryly. Quite: such low numbers simply aren't in most City spreadsheets.</p> <p>Who knows? Maybe the investment world's implied faith in US politicians' pragmaticism and central bankers' box of monetary tricks will prove well founded. And maybe those bullish fund managers are correct to regard weak third-quarter earnings numbers as a \"rear-view mirror\" phenomenon. But, if Sorrell is right, the mood on the front line of real companies is considerably less optimistic.</p> <p>Indeed, away from the world of pontification, Ford announced plans to shed 10% of its UK workforce on Thursday. The telling phrase was \"weight of numbers\" \u2013 the sheer size of overcapacity in the European car market. Government-sponsored scrappage schemes generated demand for a while, but vehicle sales in western Europe now stand at the lowest level for nearly 20 years, down by a fifth from their peak in 2007.</p> <p>On a day of economic statistics, that's the one that, unfortunately, stands out.</p>",
  "<p>Britain has rebuffed US pleas to use military bases in the UK to support the build-up of forces in the Gulf, citing secret legal advice which states that any pre-emptive strike on Iran could be in breach of international law.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told that US diplomats have also lobbied for the use of British bases in Cyprus, and for permission to fly from US bases on Ascension Island in the Atlantic and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, both of which are British territories.</p> <p>The US approaches are part of contingency planning over the nuclear standoff with Tehran, but British ministers have so far reacted coolly. They have pointed US officials to legal advice drafted by the attorney general's office which has been circulated to Downing Street, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>This makes clear that Iran, which has consistently denied it has plans to develop a nuclear weapon, does not currently represent \"a clear and present threat\". Providing assistance to forces that could be involved in a pre-emptive strike would be a clear breach of international law, it states.</p> <p>\"The UK would be in breach of international law if it facilitated what amounted to a pre-emptive strike on Iran,\" said a senior Whitehall source. \"It is explicit. The government has been using this to push back against the Americans.\"</p> <p>Sources said the US had yet to make a formal request to the British government, and that they did not believe an acceleration towards conflict was imminent or more likely. The discussions so far had been to scope out the British position, they said.</p> <p>\"But I think the US has been surprised that ministers have been reluctant to provide assurances about this kind of upfront assistance,\" said one source. \"They'd expect resistance from senior Liberal Democrats, but it's Tories as well. That has come as a bit of a surprise.\"</p> <p>The situation reflects the lack of appetite within Whitehall for the UK to be drawn into any conflict, though the Royal Navy has a large presence in the Gulf in case the ongoing diplomatic efforts fail.</p> <p>The navy has up to 10 ships in the region, including a nuclear-powered submarine. Its counter-mine vessels are on permanent rotation to help ensure that the strategically important shipping lanes through the Strait of Hormuz remain open.</p> <p>The Guardian has been told that a British military delegation with a strong navy contingent flew to US Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, earlier this summer to run through a range of contingency plans with US planners.</p> <p>The UK, however, has assumed that it would only become involved once a conflict had already begun, and has been reluctant to commit overt support to Washington in the buildup to any military action.</p> <p>\"It is quite likely that if the Israelis decided to attack Iran, or the Americans felt they had to do it for the Israelis or in support of them, the UK would not be told beforehand,\" said the source. \"In some respects, the UK government would prefer it that way.\"</p> <p>British and US diplomats insisted that the two countries regarded a diplomatic solution as the priority. But this depends on the White House being able to restrain Israel, which is nervous that Iran's underground uranium enrichment plant will soon make its nuclear programme immune to any outside attempts to stop it.</p> <p>Israel has a less developed strike capability and its window for action against Iran will close much more quickly than that of the US, explained another official. \"The key to holding back Israel is Israeli confidence that the US will deal with Iran when the moment is right.\"</p> <p>With diplomatic efforts stalled by the US presidential election campaign, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/11/diplomatic-defusing-iranian-nuclear-crisis\" title=\"\">a new push to resolve the crisis</a> will begin in late November or December.</p> <p>Six global powers will spearhead a drive which is likely to involve an offer to lift some of the sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy in return for Tehran limiting its stockpile of enriched uranium.</p> <p>The countries involved are the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China. Iran will be represented by its chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"As we continue to make clear, the government does not believe military action against Iran is the right course of action at this time, although no option is off the table. We believe that the twin-track approach of pressure through sanctions, which are having an impact, and engagement with Iran is the best way to resolve the nuclear issue. We are not going to speculate about scenarios in which military action would be legal. That would depend on the circumstances at the time.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office said it would not disclose whether the attorney general's advice has been sought on any specific issue.</p> <p>A US state department official said: \"The US and the UK co-ordinate on all kinds of subjects all the time, on a huge range of issues. We never speak on the record about these types of conversations.\"</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, warned at the UN general assembly last month that Iran's nuclear programme would reach Israel's \"red line\" by \"next spring, at most by next summer\", implying that Israel might then take military action in an attempt to destroy nuclear sites and set back the programme.</p> <p>That red line, which Netanyahu illustrated at the UN with a marker pen on a picture of a bomb, is defined by Iranian progress in making uranium enriched to 20%, which would be much easier than uranium enriched to 5% to turn into weapons-grade material, should Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, take the strategic decision to abandon Iran's observance of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and try to make a weapon. Tehran insists it has no such intention.</p> <p>In August, the most senior US military officer, General Martin Dempsey, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/israeli-attack-iran-not-stop-nuclear\" title=\"\">distanced himself from any Israeli plan to bomb Iran</a>. He said such an attack would \"clearly delay but probably not destroy Iran's nuclear programme\".</p> <p>He added: \"I don't want to be complicit if they [Israel] choose to do it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Britain's mixed economic recovery was starkly illustrated on Thursday as Ford closed two sites with the loss of up to 1,400 manufacturing jobs, while Debenhams lifted the mood of embattled high street retailers by announcing plans for 17 new department stores.</p> <p>The contrasting news underlined the difficulties facing George Osborne as he targets a rebalancing that will divert GDP growth away from debt-fuelled spending towards exports.</p> <p>Ford gave a jolt to those plans on Thursday by signalling an end to more than a century of vehicle production in the UK. The US carmaker is closing its Transit van plant in Southampton and a panel-stamping operation in Dagenham next summer, 102 years after starting production of the Model T in Manchester. Ford will still produce and design engines in the UK but the Unite trade union described the shutdowns as \"disgraceful\".</p> <p>Debenhams, meanwhile, reaffirmed the importance of shoppers to Britain's economic health as the UK's second largest department store group pledged to open new sites and hire an extra 1,700 people. The retailer said customers had become acclimatised to the \"new reality\" of an uncertain economic environment, allowing Debenhams to expand aggressively in the UK, while exporting its business model by ramping up foreign store openings.</p> <p>Ford confirmed on Thursday that the economic reality for mass-market car producers is a retrenchment that will cost thousands of manufacturing jobs across the continent, with the US firm shedding 6,200 positions in Europe this week alone.</p> <p>It is the latest mass-market automotive business to restructure its European operations as carmakers seek to eradicate a glut of capacity amid falling sales, which have left manufacturers with too many plants and too little demand.</p> <p>Britain is Ford's largest market for Transits, but the vehicle will now be imported to the UK from Turkey. Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey, said thousands more jobs could be affected as the closures ripple through Ford's UK supply chain.</p> <p>\"Ford has betrayed its workforce and its loyal customer base. Unite is going to fight these closures,\" McCluskey said. \"This announcement has been handled disgracefully. Only a few months ago, Ford was promising staff a new Transit model for Southampton in 2014. The planned closures will really hurt the local economies and the supply chain will be badly hit.\"</p> <p>Shop stewards representing Ford's 11,500 staff were told the news on Thursday morning by Ford's European boss, Stephen Odell, in a meeting at the company's technical centre in Basildon. Ford said it hoped to reduce the net redundancy total to 1,100 through relocating 300 staff. It said that the Southampton factory and the Dagenham stamping operation \u2013 which makes van panels for Southampton \u2013 had to shut as part of a programme to stem European losses that will cost the company more than $1.5bn (\u00a3930m) this year. Dagenham's engine plant, which is on the same site as the stamping operation, will remain open.</p> <p>Odell said Southampton was shutting because Ford's Transit plant in Kocaeli, Turkey, already has the spare capacity to make the 28,000 vans that were produced on the south coast last year.</p> <p>\"We absolutely believe that we are doing what is necessary for an industry that is significantly over capacity,\" said Odell. He added that it was significantly cheaper to build Transits in Turkey and transport them to the UK than to build and sell them in Britain.</p> <p>Nonetheless, news of the Dagenham closure came as a shock to Ford's staff. One union representative walked out of the Basildon meeting to inform workers at nearby Dagenham, with unconfirmed rumours of a staff walkout on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>Ford denied that unofficial industrial action had taken place, but confirmed that the entire Dagenham and Southampton workforces had been given the rest of the day off following a staff briefing.</p> <p>Ford said it hoped to achieve the UK staff reductions through a voluntary programme. It employs 500 people at Southampton and 750 at the Dagenham stamping operation, plus 150 support staff.</p> <p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, said the news was \"very disappointing\". He added that the government has awarded Ford a multimillion-pound grant to support the development of the Dagenham engine plant.</p> <p>\"Our priority will be to help the workforce and we will be working with Ford to get them into new jobs as quickly as possible,\" said Cable.</p> <p>Dagenham is the company's biggest UK site, where the majority of the 4,000 staff are involved in diesel engine manufacturing rather than stamping. It also has plants at Bridgend in Wales and Halewood in Merseyside, as well as a technical centre in Basildon, employing a total of 11,500 in the UK.</p> <p>Ford offered guarantees about the future of both Dagenham and Basildon by pledging to invest in the production and design of a new hi-tech, low-carbon diesel engine at both sites. Odell said these commitments were \"significant.\" He added: \"We have made very definite statements about our long-term commitment to engineering, production and powertrain development that go out a long way into the future.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/24/ford-shuts-belgian-factory-uk-unions\" title=\"\">The Southampton and Dagenham announcements took the number of Ford operations closures to three in two days after the firm announced on Wednesday that it will shut its factory in Genk, Belgium, with the loss of 4,300 jobs</a>. The company said it had to address a capacity glut caused by a 20% fall in industry-wide demand in western Europe since 2007: sales in its main European markets have fallen 12% in the year to date, to 861,000&#xa0;vehicles.</p> <p>High street stalwart Debenhams gave a more positive view of the economic environment by announcing plans to take its British estate to 171 shops. The store group's chief executive, Michael Sharp, said that retailers were battling against a \"very difficult market\". But he added that Debenhams, which reported a 4% increase in full-year pre-tax profits to \u00a3158.3m, expects to continue bucking the trend.</p> <p>\"We believe that customers are acclimatised to the new economic reality,\" he said. \"While we don't anticipate a significant change in the economic environment in 2013, we expect to make further progress during the year.\"</p> <p>The retailer is also pushing ahead with its overseas expansion and increased its target for new foreign franchise store openings from 130 to 150, with a particular focus on the Middle East and Asia. The latter has proven to be an important growth market for high-end UK car manufacturers, with Bentley, Mini and Jaguar Land Rover all benefiting from a boom in Chinese demand.</p>",
  "<p>Fish from the waters around the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan could be too radioactive to eat for a decade to come, as samples show that radioactivity levels remain elevated and show little sign of coming down, a marine scientist has warned.</p> <p>According to a paper published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/\" title=\"\">Science</a> on Thursday, large and bottom-dwelling species carry most risk, which means cod, flounder, halibut, pollock, skate and sole from the waters in question could be off limits for years, .</p> <p>Sample fish caught in waters near the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/28/fukushima-released-double-radioactive-material?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">stricken reactors</a> suggest there is still a source of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium\" title=\"\">caesium</a> either on the seafloor or still being discharged into the sea, perhaps from what is left of the cooling waters. As the levels of radioactive isotopes in the fish are not declining as fast as they should have, the outlook for fishing in the area is likely to be poor for the next 10 years, the paper's author told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"These fish could have to be banned for a long time. The most surprising thing for me was that the levels [of radioactivity] in the fish were not going down. There should have been much lower numbers,\" said <a href=\"http://www.whoi.edu/profile/kbuesseler/\" title=\"\">Ken Buesseler</a>, senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the US, who wrote the paper titled Fishing For Answers Off Fukushima.</p> <p>He said his findings \u2013 taken in part from Japanese research and sampling of fish in the area \u2013 showed how difficult it was to predict the outcome of a nuclear incident such as that at Fukushima. In 2011, after the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on 11 March and killed nearly 20,000 people, the nuclear reactors suffered a series of serious radiation leaks as their cooling systems failed, and workers fought frantically to try to shut them down. It was the world's worst nuclear accident since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Chernobyl</a>, in Ukraine in 1986.</p> <p>In the wake of the incident, the Japanese government sought to calm public fears by lowering the levels of radioactivity that would mean a fish was deemed unsafe for human consumption. As of April 2012, fish can only be sold in Japan if it contains less than 100 becquerels of caesium 134 and 137 in seafood per kilogram of wet weight, down from a previous limit of 500 becquerels.</p> <p>Buesseler said this was not because scientific advice had changed, but because the government wanted to reassure people. \"This is not lethal \u2013 I'm not trying to be alarmist,\" he said. \"But the levels [of radioactivity in the fish] are measurable and consistent. It's a small increase in risk.\"</p> <p>However, eating large quantities of such fish over a long period could be harmful, he said. Fish is a more important part of the Japanese diet than in countries such as the US and the UK.</p>",
  "<p>From beyond the grave Elizabeth Taylor has overtaken her close friend Michael Jackson to become the top earning dead celebrity. The estate of the actor, who died last year, earned $210m (\u00a3130m) in the past 12 months largely due to Christie's record-setting auction of her jewellery and art collection, according to Forbes' annual poll of the richest dead celebrities.</p> <p>Taylor's auction, which included a Van Gogh that fetched $24.6m, helped her push Jackson into second place. Her fortunes were also boosted by sales of her perfume, White Diamond, which earned $75m in 2011.</p> <p>With the sale behind her Taylor may struggle to keep her crown next year from Jackson. The King of Pop's fortunes appear to have risen since his death in 2009, not least because he is no longer around to spend it. His estate took in $145m, according to Forbes, more than any other artist. Much of the money came from his half share in the Sony/ATV publishing catalogue, whose artists include the Beatles and Lady Gaga.</p> <p>The third slot in Forbes' poll went to another King, Elvis Presley. His estate suffered after the Viva Elvis show in Las Vegas closed but attendances at his home Graceland rose, helped by warm weather. One billionaire is betting his reign will continue. Investor Leon Black's Apollo Global Management bought CKX, the parent company of American Idol and the estates of Elvis and Muhammad Ali, last year for $509m. Black likes icons. He bought one of four versions of Edvard Munch's The Scream for $119m earlier this year.</p> <p>The top three, all of whom were immortalised by Andy Warhol, are followed by Charles Schulz this year. The Peanuts comic strip creator made $37m in the past 12 months and his estate is set for another boost as Fox prepares a big screen movie from the team behind the hit Ice Age movies.</p> <p>While Jackson looks set to reclaim his crown next year, 2013 could witness an unlikely fight between Charlie Brown, Taylor and Presley for the runner-up prize.</p>",

Today they are recognised as pretty accurate representations of London's air pollution at the end of the 19th century.</p> <p>The famous London \"pea-souper\" smogs, caused mainly by coal-burning in hundreds of thousands of homes and factories, have now gone, only to be replaced by a cocktail of equally toxic, invisible chemicals emittted by vehicles, and yesterday the government <a href=\"http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">issued a \"high\" air pollution alert</a> for London and south-east England.</p> <p>But should the politicians in Westminster look back across the Thames, they will see a short animation film of a child projected on to a giant video screen in front of the same St Thomas's hospital that Monet painted from. Called Breathe, the film is made up from more 1,000 pencil drawings of London artist <a href=\"http://www.drydengoodwin.com/\" title=\"\">Dryden Goodwin</a>'s five-year-old son.</p> <p>The film will be played every night this week with the intention of highlighting the fragility of children living in polluted cities, and the dangers that pollution posesx\u00a7.</p> <p>Goodwin created the work after he was linked by art curator Alice Sharp to Prof <a href=\"http://www.erg.kcl.ac.uk/WhosWho/ProfFrankKelly.aspx?DeptID=WhosWho\" title=\"\">Frank Kelly</a>, an expert on lung health at King's College London and an adviser to the government on air pollutants. Kelly's recent research has focused on the effects that measures such as the congestion charge and the low-emission zone have had on the lung health of children living in east London, whose developing respiratory systems are particularly sensitive to changes in air quality.</p> <p>Kelly says: \"Children are more vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs are underdeveloped at birth and mature slowly during childhood. Several studies have shown that breathing polluted city air is associated with significant adverse effects on children's respiratory health.\"</p> <p>London is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/15/london-air-pollution-record-high\" title=\"\">one of the most polluted cities in Europe</a>, with several thousand premature deaths attributed to air pollution a year. Levels of air pollution across London frequently exceed EU limits and breach World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The WHO estimates that urban air pollution is responsible now globally for about 8% of lung cancer deaths, 5% of cardio-pulmonary deaths and about 3% of all respiratory infection deaths.</p> <p>Goodwin's film is the second in a series called <a href=\"http://invisibledust.com/about/\" title=\"\">Invisible Dust</a>.

  "<p>The United Nations is to set up a dedicated investigations unit in Geneva early next year to examine the legality of drone attacks in cases where civilians are killed in so-called \"targeted\" counter-terrorism operations.</p> <p>The announcement was made by Ben Emmerson QC, a UN special rapporteur, in a speech to Harvard law school in which he condemned secret rendition and waterboarding as crimes under international law. His forthright comments, directed at both US presidential candidates, will be seen as an explicit challenge to the prevailing US ideology of the global war on terror.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, Emmerson, who monitors counter-terrorism for the UN, called for effective investigations into drone attacks. Some US drone strikes in Pakistan may amount to war crimes, Emmerson warned.</p> <p>In his Harvard speech, he said: \"If the relevant states are not willing to establish effective independent monitoring mechanisms \u2026 then it may in the last resort be necessary for the UN to act.</p> <p>\"Together with my colleague Christof Heyns, [the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings], I will be launching an investigation unit within the special procedures of the [UN] Human Rights Council to inquire into individual drone attacks.\"</p> <p>The investigation unit will also look at \"other forms of targeted killing conducted in counter-terrorism operations, in which it is alleged that civilian casualties have been inflicted\". Emmerson maintained that the US stance that it can conduct counter-terrorism operations against al-Qaida or other groups anywhere in the world because it is deemed to be an international conflict was indefensible.</p> <p>\"The global war paradigm has done immense damage to a previously shared international consensus on the legal framework underlying both international human rights law and international humanitarian law,\" he said. \"It has also given a spurious justification to a range of serious human rights and humanitarian law violations.</p> <p>\"The [global] war paradigm was always based on the flimsiest of reasoning, and was not supported even by close allies of the US. The first-term Obama administration initially retreated from this approach, but over the past 18 months it has begun to rear its head once again, in briefings by administration officials seeking to provide a legal justification for the drone programme of targeted killing in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia \u2026</p> <p>\"[It is] alleged that since President Obama took office at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims and more than 20 civilians have also been attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals and mourners. Christof Heyns \u2026 has described such attacks, if they prove to have happened, as war crimes. I would endorse that view.\"</p> <p>Emmerson singled out both President Obama and the Republican challenger Mitt Romney for criticism. \"It is perhaps surprising that the position of the two candidates on this issue has not even featured during their presidential elections campaigns, and got no mention at all in Monday night's foreign policy debate.</p> <p>\"We now know that the two candidates are in agreement on the use of drones. But the issue of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques is an one which, according to the record, continues to divide them.</p> <p>\"I should make it absolutely clear that my mandate does not see to eye to eye with the Obama administration on a range of issues \u2013 not least the lack of transparency over the drone programme. But on this issue the president has been clear since he took office that water-boarding is torture that it is contrary to American values and that it would stop.</p> <p>\"... But Governor Romney has said that he does not believe that waterboarding is torture. He has said that he would allow enhanced interrogation techniques that go beyond those now permitted by the army field manual, and his security advisers have recommended that he rescind the existing restrictions.\"</p> <p>The Cambodian dictator Pol Pot, he pointed out, used the technique. \"Anyone who is in doubt about whether waterboarding is torture should visit Tuol Sleng, the infamous S-21 detention facility operated by the Khymer Rouge in Phnom Penh.</p> <p>\"Over a period of four years 14,000 people were systematically tortured and killed there. It is now a genocide museum. And right there, in the middle of the central torturing room, is the apparatus used by Pol Pot's security officials for waterboarding.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Adjaye, the architect chosen to design Washington DC's $500m <a href=\"http://nmaahc.si.edu/\" title=\"\">National Museum of African American History and Culture</a>, has topped a list of Britain's most influential black people, ahead of double Olympic gold medallist Mo Farah and The Wire star Idris Elba.</p> <p>In the sixth edition of the annual <a href=\"http://content.yudu.com/A1zgh3/PowerList2013/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=\" title=\"\">PowerList</a>, the top 100 people regarded as role models in their fields, the Tanzanian-born founder of <a href=\"http://www.adjaye.com/\" title=\"\">Adjaye Associates</a> is hailed as an inspirational figure who saw off financial crisis during the recession to become one of the country's most high-profile architects.</p> <p>At No 2 is Pat McGrath, a make-up artist from Northampton who has worked with designers including Prada and Armani. Farah is third and at No 5 is Damon Buffini, the former chairman of the private equity firm Permira. Also in the top 10 are John Sentamu, the outspoken archbishop of York, and Chuka Umunna, the telegenic Labour MP and shadow business secretary.</p> <p>Michael Eboda, the editor who began the PowerList, said the initial idea was to show that \"there was more to the black community than footballers and entertainers\".</p> <p>\"Since then it's taken on a life of its own,\" he said. \"What we've realised is this is about role models primarily&#xa0;\u2026 It's become more about showing youngsters that with a bit of hard work and dedication this is what you can do. We feel the easiest way of showing somebody what's possible is by showing them somebody who's already done it, who maybe looks like them and has come from a similar background as them.\"</p> <p>Eboda said about 20,000 copies of the PowerList 2013 would be sent to schools across the UK.</p> <p>The qualification for selection on the list was \"the ability to alter events and change lives in a positive way\", Eboda said. It's not about how much money someone has but about how much influence they have.\"</p> <p>He said the list was a useful tool in smashing stereotypes.</p> <p>\"The truth is most people who are on screen and most footballers are not that influential when you judge it by that definition. They probably get paid a good sum of money and they're probably quite famous and well-known. But if you look at people who really&#xa0;\u2026 make things happen it tends not to be them. It tends to be people who are behind the scenes.\"</p> <p>This year, figures who have previously topped the list, such as Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive of the Prudential insurance group, Baroness Scotland, Baroness Amos and the billionaire philanthropist Mo Ibrahim, have been moved to a Hall of Fame to make way for new names. Also in 2013's top 10 are businessman Ken Olisa, lawyer Sandie Okoro, and Karen Blackett, the chief executive of MediaCom.</p> <p>In 2009 Adjaye agreed a company voluntary arrangement with creditors to prevent his business collapsing and he has since consolidated his reputation as a creative showman and \"starchitect\" to celebrity clients. Eboda said he was inspirational not only for his achievements but his comeback of the past three years. Earlier this year he was present at <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/arts/design/groundbreaking-for-the-museum-of-african-american-history.html\" title=\"\">the ground breaking ceremony</a> of the African American museum on the National Mall in Washington DC, which was first proposed by black Civil War veterans nearly a century ago.</p> <p>In 2005, Adjaye incurred the wrath of the columnist and broadcaster Janet Street-Porter over problems with her house. She later wrote that she dreamed \"of ritually disemboweling\" him \"before mopping up the stormwater in my living room with his designer sweaters\". Adjaye, the son of a Ghanaian diplomat who came to Britain at the age of nine, said the row was a shame but that the problems had not been due to his designs.</p> <p>He is expected to attend <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/black-history-month-reception/\" title=\"\">a reception at Downing Street</a> on Thursday to mark Black History Month. Writing in the PowerList, David Cameron said: \"We should never underestimate the power of role models. When teenagers see high achievers who look like them, who have reached the top in law, business, politics, they're going to think: 'I can do that; I can go far too.'\"</p> <h2>Top 10</h2> <p>1 David Adjaye, architect</p> <p>2.

Mopapp tracks 1.2 Million apps public data daily.</p> <h2>How is the app ecosystem changing? Which development platforms hold promise for the future?</h2> <p>Before talking about the development platform, we need to focus about what the app ecosystem actually is: it's just a new way to deliver content on a global scale. It's still the content that matters. Content can be a service (like hotel booking), data (like weather info, or stock exchange performance) or information (like Guardian news).</p> <p>Now the idea is that the development platform that can help to box those contents more efficiently, more nicely, on more devices and in all stores will win. Will it ever be such a platform?</p> <p>I doubt it. It's like saying which plumbing tool is more promising? We need a variety of tools depending on the goal we need to accomplish. In many cases going native on every major platform (like iOS, Android, Windows phone even BlackBerry) is the right answer.</p> <p>However there are some tools out there than can help to develop faster on more platforms. I see a good trend on Unity not only for game development, Phonegap is getting some new strength due to the Adobe acquisition. Titanium, from Appcelerator is the more mature and widely adopted cross platform tool today. It has been also featured on a Gartner visionary quadrant! More than 40.000 apps has been developed using this platform.</p> <h2>Who do you most admire in mobile? Who inspires you?</h2> <p>I admire all entrepreneurs able to create applications who made the world a better place. For me, as a human being, a better place is a more interconnected place. When people are able to exchange information, something good will emerge.</p> <p>Clear winners in mobile are Google, Twitter, Facebook. They have millions of downloads. But they can't be considered \"pure\" mobile companies. They existed before mobile. \"Pure mobile\" business are able to exploit the two biggest strengths of mobile: connectivity and localisation.</p> <p>In the game industry, Outfit7, creators of Talking Tom Cat, and ZeptoLab, creators of Cut the Rope. They both created outstanding entertaining apps that became great success all over the world.</p> <p>Star Walk is invaluable when you want to look at the sky with your child to discover stars and constellations!</p> <h2>How might publishers deliver their content and monetise that content in new ways?</h2> <p>Our estimates are that total revenues generated by the Apple App Store in US during August 2012 was about $150M. Uk produced less than $30M. China $10M. Other countries like Germany, France, Italy, generated less than $4M each. Google Play. The same countries but China (where there are various alternative Android markets) generated about $100M total revenues, still August 2012.</p> <p>It is astonishing that two single companies manage the whole application market, but even for them the application market itself was not that significant. Apple revenues for Q2 2012 were $39.2Bn, then just the \".2\" was coming from apps during the same quarter.</p> <p>Similarly for Google \u2013 out of $11Bn revenues during Q2 2012, about 1% came from the application market.</p> <p>What we're seeing today it's the mobile market at its infancy. It's growing, but the overall numbers are still small.</p> <p>For app developer, the situation is worse. As it often happens, there are very few big winners, and most losers. If your application is below the top 200 top grossing, you will hardly make a living out of it: 50% of the revenues are generated by the top 1 per thousand.</p> <p>If that was the new \"mobile market\", we should definitely stop talking about a boom. Growth is sluggish too --the rate of growth of the number of applications is higher than the rate of growth of the generated revenues...</p> <p>But there is a good news. We are talking here about revenues generated only by application purchase, or in-app purchase.</p> <p>If someone analysed the Internet market during the 1990s, the situation was even worse. Developers had practically no mean to generate revenues. Still is arguably hard to underestimate the importance of that revolution.</p> <p>So, building a website is expensive, but creating an app is expensive too. Where will the money come from? Mobile Advertising is the usual suspects, and with the increase of adoption of Real Time Bidding from Demand-Side platforms, its growth will be strong in the next years.</p> <p>However outside app store monetisation could be possible.</p> <p>Let's take just one example. Square, the credit card reader app. Its 2M users are processing $6Bn a year in payments. At 2.75 -3.5% transaction fees, it makes about $200M yearly revenues. An impressive sum, nothing of which coming from the app store. The leader in the market, PayPal, immediately followed, making clear who is dictating the game's rules \u2013the new, mobile-oriented company, Square. Not the old, website-oriented company, PayPal.</p> <h2>What's the key to demonstrating return on investment in mobile?</h2> <p>How do you measure ROI has its roots to the purpose of developing a mobile app.</p> <p>If it's for brand awareness, probably the number of downloads suffice. If it's for promoting a new business service the Mobile Active Users (daily active users, weekly active users, monthly active users). If you add a mobile e-commerce section, the active users, the total number of transactions and the average purchasing price.</p> <p>If you sell subscriptions based news, downloads, new subscription, subscription cancellation, session length.</p> <p>For a game, downloads, active users, session length, in-app purchase, advertising eCPM (if advertising is included), sharing (percentage of users that share their experience). In one world Engagement, delivered via Facebook and Twitter. Luckily, all those can be measured and related to your ROI expectation, that should be set beforehand. Mopapp can help in those measurements, off course.</p> <h2>How can publishers survive the transition to a mobile-first web experience for consumers of their content? Are we facing a mobile-only or a mobile-plus future for the consumption of content online?</h2> <p>Content is already mobile! Web is already mobile!</p> <p>There's not big difference between web or mobile in terms of content. Web is already delocalised!</p> <p>The difference is that now we can better track location and publishers have a new opportunity to deliver localised content and to push content. Anytime.</p> <p>Like in every technology transitions, the ones that will better leverage this new opportunity will flourish.</p> <p>Mobile-plus is the more likely. Screen factor is still the big differentiator in terms of content consumption. Not every content fit the small screen. Maybe Google glasses like projects can overcome this limits.</p> <h2>What are the monetisation tactics, design standards, and emerging platforms that are helping produce sustainable business models?</h2> <p>The key is having a growing user base, and a continuous stream of income per user. But it's important to understand that applications will not make money always through the app stores, as seen above.</p> <p>First, when I design an application I must think: how will people know about it? Why should people use it? Apart from marketing, the best way to have your application known is creating a great application. Mobile is much more personal than pc. People like to show their preferred app to friends. Word of mouth is very important. Outstanding design helps word of mouth.</p> <p>Second, monetisation has to come outside the app store. Take square up (payments) app, or iZettle in Europe: they are free, without in-apps, still highly profitable. Or Lyft and SideCar. They all made available services which were very expensive to set up only ten years ago. Now you can accept credit card payment on the street, because the mobile is ubiquitous. You can rent your driving skills, because the mobile knows where you are, and where is the person looking for a lift.</p> <p>I think people was too much focused on making money selling the app. Now it's clear that apps leveraging on mobiles' strength (ubiquity, localisation) are more able to monetise, well outside the app store.</p> <p><strong>Should mobile and tablet advertising be defined as their own channel or will new technologies, ad formats and design standards see mobile converge into the whole mix of digital media and connected screens?</strong></p> <p>New technology, new format and standardisation are emerging. Consider MRAID (Mobile Rich Media Interface Definition from iab. Real-time mobile ad bidding will totally change the way advertisers buy in mobile.</p> <p>Publishers are starting to look for new ways to monetise beyond the single ad network system. Large mobile publishers, like gaming giant ngmoco, adopt ad serving, ad operations and sophisticated reporting platforms to power advertising on their mobile games and apps. Companies like Backflip Studios, The Economist and BET already have established in-house ad operations teams specifically focused on mobile.</p> <p>As the balance of power shifts toward publishers, and the dollars flow toward real-time bidding, where SDK integrations aren't even necessary, we'll finally see a more fluid environment blending web and mobile.</p> <p>When these barriers will be brought down a new pervasive multi screen era will emerge.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, s</strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>ign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Tesco Bank is to team up with microfinance specialist Grameen Bank to offer microloans to entrepreneurs in the most deprived areas of Scotland.</p> <p>The supermarket bank said that the Grameen Scotland Foundation (GSF) will identify prospective entrepreneurs currently locked out of the financial system who would benefit from microloans \u2013 small loans charged at competitive rates of interest that require no collateral.</p> <p>The scheme, which is backed by funding from the Scottish government and entrepreneurs such as the co-founder of Stagecoach, Ann Gloag, will initially operate in Glasgow, North Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire and Inverclyde.

The idea rocketed in popularity across Bangladesh and the concept of microfinance was adopted by other countries. Yunus soon became known as \"the banker to the world's poor\".</p> <p>Although microfinance has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/aug/18/microfinance-sober-reckoning-studies-question\" title=\"\">partly discredited by development experts</a> as a means of supporting entrepreneurship, alleviating poverty and empowering women, Tesco Bank said it hoped it would help Scotland's struggling businesspeople, whose success will, in turn, boost the local economy.</p> <p>Aside from providing \u00a3500,000 of the GSF's initial loan capital, Tesco Bank will provide basic savings accounts to Grameen borrowers as well as services such as business advice and advertising space in local Tesco stores.</p> <p>Benny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, said: \"In partnering Grameen in Scotland, we will provide loan funding, professional guidance from our staff and access to our stores to help set up new businesses which, over time, can improve the local economy.\"</p> <p>A Tesco Bank spokesman added that, while the firm's involvement is not in a commercial capacity \u2013 \"we are part of a social enterprise\" ,\u2013 he envisaged borrowers would be charged 19% APR on their microloans.</p> <p>Yunus, who won the Nobel peace prize in 2006 for the bank's anti-poverty work, said: \"Poor people need to be given the right opportunities to be able to succeed in their own lives and this is what Grameen helps them to do. We must encourage people to envision their own futures and, once that is done, find out how to get there \u2013 once a person has a vision, it can be made real.\"</p> <p>The GSF will oversee the activities of Grameen bankers, who will work closely with low-income communities to identify prospective entrepreneurs. Borrowers will not be required to provide collateral and will instead be asked to provide evidence of a pattern of saving.</p> <p>With a target of raising \u00a33m in funding over the next five years, the GSF hopes to expand the project into other parts of the UK affected by social problems, with borrowers also becoming stakeholders in the Grameen system and thus able to hold the chief executive accountable.</p> <h2><strong>Q&amp;A: how do microloans work?</strong></h2> <p><strong>What is a microloan?</strong></p> <p>A microloan, also referred to as microcredit, is the loan of a small sum to an impoverished borrower, or someone who is unable to obtain a loan through mainstream routes.</p> <p><strong>Who is eligible for a loan of this type?</strong></p> <p>Grameen Bank specialises in group lending and payment plans with long lending terms when offering credit to the poor.</p> <p><strong>How do they work?</strong></p> <p>Instead of requiring borrowers to provide collateral for a loan, borrowers are instead asked to provide evidence a pattern of saving and are encouraged to focus on family health and education. Traditionally, groups of five people \u2013 predominantly female in Bangladesh and developing countries \u2013 are formed which then go through a short financial training course. Each borrower gets a loan to start or expand a small business. They then receive further financial advice, training and support as repayments are made.</p> <p>After full repayment, borrowers can apply for another loan so their businesses can continue to grow. The loans are typically used to finance social businesses, such as lunch clubs, laundries and cafes, depending on the wishes of the borrowers.</p> <p><strong>Isn't it dangerous to offer loans to people with no collateral?</strong></p> <p>Grameen bank claims a <a href=\"http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=452&amp;Itemid=526\" title=\"\">loan recovery rate of 96.8%</a>.</p> <p><strong>How much money will Grameen be making out of the venture?</strong></p> <p>Grameen has no shareholders and is effectively \"owned\" by its borrowers. As a social business, all funds remain within the business, generating resources for new loans while covering costs.</p> <p><strong>Is Scotland the first \"developed\" economy to try Grameen's methods?</strong></p> <p>No. Grameen America launched in 2008 in New York and repayment rates are above 99%.</p>",
  "<p>The proprietor of the New York Times has reassured staff unsettled by the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal that Mark Thompson, the former BBC director general and incoming chief executive, \"possesses high ethical standards and is the ideal person to lead our company\".</p> <p>Arthur Sulzberger Jr, chairman and New York Times Company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/25/new-york-times-mark-thompson-jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">said in an internal email on Thursday</a> that he was satisfied Thompson \"played no role\" in the cancellation of BBC current affairs show Newsnight's investigation into the Savile sex abuse allegations in late 2011, when he was still director general. Thompson is due to begin his new job on 12 November.</p> <p>Thompson's knowledge of the Newsnight story and allegations about Savile has come under intense scrutiny since Margaret Sullivan, the New York Times public editor, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/times-must-aggressively-cover-mark-thompsons-role-in-bbcs-troubles/\" title=\"\">published a blog on Tuesday</a> saying it was \"worth considering now if he is the right person for the job\" in light of the scandal enveloping the BBC. Sullivan also called for the paper to \"aggressively cover\" Thompson's role in the BBC scandal.</p> <p>\"Mark has provided a detailed account of [Newsnight's Savile story], and I am satisfied that he played no role in the cancellation of the segment,\" Sulzberger told staff.</p> <p>He said that he and the other New York Times Company directors had got to know Thompson very well in the months leading up to his appointment. \"Our opinion was then and remains now that he possesses high ethical standards and is the ideal person to lead our company as we focus on growing our businesses through digital and global expansion,\" Sulzberger added.</p> <p>\"As you all instinctively know, but it is worth stating again, we will cover the Savile story with objectivity and rigour.

  "<p>John Long couldn't bring himself to vote in the last presidential election. The head of Florida's Tea Party movement despised John McCain and Barack Obama in equal measure.</p> <p>But next month Long will cast a ballot for Mitt Romney even though he regards the Republican presidential candidate as carrying much of the same baggage as McCain. The crucial difference for Long, who is pastor of a church set up for construction workers at Disneyland, is that after four years of Obama he would vote for anyone else. Plus, Romney has one overriding asset.</p> <p>\"The vast majority of people wouldn't have voted for John McCain if he was running unopposed. He was the worst nominee in the history of the United States,\" said Long. \"Romney is better than McCain because McCain didn't have a lick of business sense. For all of the things over which Mitt Romney and I disagree, for all the ways in which he doesn't turn me on, I respect a man who promises to come to Washington and look at the United States government as a business. If Mitt Romney was an abortion supporter, if Mitt Romney favoured gay marriage, if he believed in global warming, I'd still be fine with him if he would go to Washington and run it like a business.\"</p> <p>That view is increasingly expressed, albeit in less trenchant form, by once wavering voters across Florida \u2013 among the most important of swing states for Romney because there is almost no chance of him taking the presidency without winning it.</p> <p>\"I've been in there asking for a job,\" said Bob Brachett, a 38-year-old unemployed man outside a Staples office supply store \u2013 the chain Romney turned into a successful nationwide operation. \"I did vote for Obama last time and I don't think he's a bad president or a bad man. I don't believe a lot of the things they say about him. But the jobs situation is very bad in Florida and I don't see Obama making it better. I'll take a chance on Romney.\"</p> <p>Various branches of the Republican party were for a long time wary of Romney because of what they called the \"3Ms\": Massachusetts, Mormons and money.</p> <p>Social conservatives recoiled from Romney in the Republican primaries because of his support as Massachusetts governor a decade ago for legal abortion and gay rights, and his engineering of healthcare reforms, including a legal requirement to buy medical insurance, which provided the model for Obama's healthcare overhaul.</p> <p>There was great suspicion within the Christian right, which regards Romney's Mormon faith as a cult.</p> <p>More pragmatic elements of the party leadership feared Romney's enormous wealth \u2013 he's worth about $250m \u2013 would cause many ordinary voters to discount him as out of touch with their problems.</p> <p>The Democrats certainly tried to exploit Romney's money: how he made it, where he banked it and how much tax he paid on it. The focus of the attack was Bain Capital, Romney's private equity firm, for shipping jobs to China. The Democrats also latched onto his shifting positions on abortion, gay rights and health care to portray him as insincere and desperate for power. At a campaign stop in Florida earlier this week, Obama repeatedly accused his opponent of being afflicted with \"Romnesia\", which causes him to forget his previous political positions.</p> <p>But less than a fortnight before the election all of that appears to count for less than the Democrats in Florida hoped.</p> <p>The key to the state is Hillsborough County, a fairly diverse area politically, economically and racially that includes the port city of Tampa. No presidential candidate has won the state since 1960 without taking Hillsborough.</p> <p>Obama carried the county with 53% of the vote in 2008, the same margin of victory for George Bush four years earlier.</p> <p>The chairman of Hillsborough's Republican party, Art Wood, is cautious in predicting which way it will go this time. But he regards the election as \"dramatically different\" from four years ago when Republicans found McCain \"hard to embrace\".</p> <p>Wood said he had feared Romney faced the same problem, in part because of the 3Ms, until he shook up the election at the first presidential debate three weeks ago.</p> <p>\"The whole matrix Obama constructed about Romney collapsed with the debate. Obama was doing everything he can not to talk about his performance, not to talk about the economy. He spent months talking about how bad Romney was, how Romney hates women and Romney's in favour of tax cuts for the rich. Nasty labels. And then Romney starts talking and people see he's a decent guy,\" said Wood.</p> <p>\"He's raised five kids that are the all-American family and Obama was raised in Indonesia and Kenya. That matrix, that charade, that whole story he constructed about Romney \u2026 it just started collapsing. It wasn't that Romney was more persuasive. It was that what so many voters thought about Romney collapsed.\"</p> <p>Part of Romney's support is constructed on a visceral dislike of Obama with overtones of racism. Among the more popular Republican campaign signs is: Take Our Country Back.</p> <p>Evangelical preachers have for months been telling their congregations that abstaining in 2008 because they did not like McCain was a disaster that let Obama slip into the White House with an un-American agenda. The message has gone out that not voting is a vote for Obama. The Christian right has embraced it and set aside concerns about Romney's religion and earlier positions on abortion and gay rights.</p> <p>But if Romney takes Florida it will be because of the bounce in the polls that followed the first presidential debate. Romney went from up to nine percentage points behind just a week earlier to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/fl/florida_romney_vs_obama-1883.html\">seven points ahead after the first debate</a>.</p> <p>Obama has since narrowed the gap but Romney retains a consistent lead. With the battering to the president's attempts to paint his opponent as incapable and out of touch, many Florida voters appear to have given the Republican candidate a second look.</p> <p>Political scientists say research shows a strengthening support for Romney among women worried about jobs and the impact of the economic crisis on their families.</p> <p>Latinos in Florida voted 57% for Obama four years ago. Now Romney is two percentage points up with them \u2013 despite Obama's claim on Wednesday that they would swing the election in his favour.</p> <p>\"Hispanics are basically Republicans \u2013 except when you get to the immigration issue,\" said Wood. \"What I believe is happening is the Hispanics are willing to make the immigration issue a second-tier issue this time around. It's not that it isn't very important but they realise the matter of jobs is more important this time.\"</p> <p>Wood said the shift since the first debate energised Republicans into believing that perhaps, after all, their man could win.</p> <p>\"There were an incredible number of Republicans [who] stayed home four years ago. The signs are that many of them will now vote,\" he said.</p> <p>Margaret Iuculano, a Republican candidate for county commissioner, said she has knocked on 30,000 doors campaigning over the past year.</p> <p>\"Early on there was a ton of indecisiveness out there. I've seen just a huge turn in the past weeks. Plenty of soft Democrats are voting for Romney,\" she said. \"People are much more educated on some of the issues. Jobs. It's always jobs. It's Romney's business experience that plays well. I have a lot of those conversations.</p> <p>\"I'm praying that what I see is factual and not wishful thinking, but I definitely see a surge in energy. I walked a neighbourhood last weekend with a lot of Republicans who hadn't voted in elections. We knocked on a lot of doors and they mostly said they were coming out to vote. We have to see if they do.\"</p> <p>Democrats have dismissed Republicans claims of a surge in support as \"bluster\", and say they have a well organised \"ground game\" to get supporters out when early voting begins on Saturday that will ultimately deliver the state to Obama. But Democratic activists concede that there does not appear to be the same level of enthusiasm among young voters as there was in 2008 when Obama relied heavily on support in college towns in Florida to win the state.</p> <p>The Democratic strategy to highlight the threat to Medicare \u2013 the government healthcare programme for the elderly \u2013 if Romney is elected also appears not to have had the impact the party hoped in Florida.</p> <p>Susan MacManus, a former chair of the Florida elections commission and a University of South Florida professor of political science, said that is in part because many retired people in the state, who often only move to Florida during the winter for the sun, are prosperous.</p> <p>\"Compared to a senior in Philadelphia or Detroit, the seniors here are younger, healthier, wealthier, better educated. Not as dependent upon Medicare. Plus you also have to take into consideration: seniors vote 42% registered Republicans, 41% Democrats and the rest no party affiliation. They're sticking to their candidate on Medicare. They're not threatened by it,\" she said.</p> <p>MacManus said that her research shows that many retirees are more likely to be concerned about the economy.</p> <p>\"A huge problem for a lot of older voters is the debt. Suddenly they're getting a call from a frantic adult child saying I'm going to lose my home, I can't make they mortgage payment, I lost my job. Retirees were shocked America could be headed toward another great depression. The deficit is a bigger issue here and it's very motivating to people. They really worry about the economic direction of the country,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p><em>This is a memo to all staff sent on Thursday by Arthur Sulzberger Jr, chairman of the New York Times Company</em></p> <p>Dear colleagues</p> <p>Our third-quarter results announced this morning reflect a challenging advertising environment in both print and digital, which was affected by a number of factors including uncertainty in the global economy, the rapidly changing habits of consumers and the increasing complexity and fragmentation of the digital advertising marketplace. We expect overall advertising revenue trends to be similar for the fourth quarter.</p> <p>On a better note, our results also reflect continued growth in our circulation revenues led by the ongoing expansion of our digital subscription base, both at the Times and the Globe. As of the end of September, paid digital subscriptions across our Company totalled 592,000, up 11% from the end of the second quarter.</p> <p>When you put it all together, the Times Company had an operating profit of $8.5m in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $21m in the same period of 2011. Excluding depreciation, amortisation and severance, operating profit was $34m in the third quarter of 2012 compared with $47.7m in the third quarter of 2011.</p> <p>There is much hard work ahead for all of us. We are aware of the challenging economic and business climate we face and over the past three months we have taken a number of decisive actions to better position our Company for the future. High among them is that Mark Thompson, the former director general of the BBC, will join us as our new president and CEO on 12 November.</p> <p>Second was our sale of the About Group, which will allow us to focus on the development and growth of our core brands. And in early October, our interest in Indeed.com was sold. The after-tax proceeds from these two sales further strengthened our liquidity and our financial flexibility.</p> <p>As you know, we are all focused on seeking and developing opportunities to broaden and deepen reader interaction. At the Times, due to your efforts, we have enhanced and continue to broaden our presence in video, mobile and social engagement. Our multifaceted coverage of the presidential election and the debates are excellent examples of this innovative work. We have also made strides in growing our global footprint, as illustrated by this month's announcement of our plans to launch a Portuguese-language site for readers in Brazil, one of the world's fastest growing economies.</p> <p>At the New England Media Group, BostonGlobe.com recently marked its one-year anniversary and continues to make steady progress in growing paid digital subscriptions. The team has implemented a variety of initiatives to increase reader interest and engagement, and to strengthen subscription opportunities. And the August launch of Boston.com's new live streaming radio station, RadioBDC, is just the latest of the site's ongoing efforts to broaden its reach in the market.</p> <p>I want to address a topic that has been on many people's minds. You no doubt have read the recent reports of a controversy regarding the BBC's decision in late 2011 to cancel a news story investigating allegations of sexual abuse and molestation by an on-air BBC talent, Jimmy Savile, who died last year. Mark has provided a detailed account of that matter, and I am satisfied that he played no role in the cancellation of the segment.</p> <p>In the months leading to our decision to bring Mark to the Times Company, Michael Golden, our vice-chairman, and I, along with the rest of our board of directors, got to know Mark very well. Our opinion was then and remains now that he possesses high ethical standards and is the ideal person to lead our company as we focus on growing our businesses through digital and global expansion. Some of you have already had the opportunity to meet Mark and many more of you will in the coming weeks and months. We are all looking forward to that day when he takes the helm.</p> <p>As you all instinctively know, but it is worth stating again, we will cover the Savile story with objectivity and rigour. Mark endorses that completely as do I. Both of us believe passionately in strong, objective journalism that operates without fear or favour, no matter what it is covering. We have dedicated a significant amount of resources to this story and this is evident by the coverage we have provided our readers.</p> <p>If you would like to hear more about our financial results, you can listen to the webcast of our earnings conference call here and you can review the company's full third-quarter earnings press release, including a reconciliation of our GAAP results.</p> <p>Thank you all for your continued dedication to our goal \u2013 to provide the highest quality news and information to our readers and advertisers \u2013 and for your focus on our future.</p> <p>Arthur</p>",
  "<p>The comedian Louis CK had a wonderful routine called \"Everything's amazing and nobody's happy,\" in which he satirized our modern exasperation with pocket-sized gadgets that, a few years back, would have been considered powerful enough to send a man into space, or at least run a modestly-sized corporation. <br> \"Uh,\" he mocks one clueless citizen shaking her smartphone, which is taking time to load, \"It won't \u2026 uh!\" </p> <p>Louis CK comes back with a roaring rejoinder: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Give it a second! It's going to space! Can you give it a second to get back from space? Is the speed of light too slow for you?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>His searing conclusion is clear: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We live in an amazing, amazing world, and it's wasted on the crappiest generation of spoiled idiots.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Louis CK delivered his routine years ago, but it has remained exceptionally relevant \u2013 particularly in a week such as this, when Apple is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/oct/23/ipad-mini-launch-live-coverage-apple\">announcing</a> several new products of overlapping abilities. The iPod touch, the iPad mini \u2013 all at exorbitant prices, while Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/24/microsoft-surface-thumbs-down-early-reviews\">introduces</a> its new tablet, the Surface, and Android fans spar over whether it's worth it to buy a Galaxy phone now or wait for the next Nexus to manifest. </p> <p>But as more consumers obsess this season about the iPad mini and the new iPod touch, and whether the Google Nexus tablet is superior to the Amazon Kindle Fire HD, and the virtues of the iPhone 5's lightning connector versus the old iPhone 4s connector that predated it by less than a year, it's a good time to step back and wonder how we have come to this pass. These devices, as fragile as Faberge eggs, packaged like jewels \u2013 and priced accordingly \u2013 have become, in many minds, almost immediately disposable as soon as the next device with retina-display resolution makes us salivate for the next big thing. </p> <p>On Twitter, this kind of behavior would be tagged #firstworldproblems \u2013 the indulgent issues of a populace too drugged on comfort and entitlement to see the reality of the privilege we live within. Having thousands of dollars to spend on adorable personal computing devices draws quite a stark contrast not just with the lack of resources of the sick, starving and homeless, but also with an America that is drowning in unemployment, or even with the deplorable conditions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/17/foxconn-children-14-factory-china\">suffered</a> by workers in Foxconn factories, giving up chunks of their freedom and lives to earn a living making these technological gems that we discard so blithely. </p> <p>Thomas Wensma, a designer and founder at Ambassador Design in the Netherlands, is trying to turn the tide. I talked to him to mull over the phenomenon by which some iPad 3 owners are already concerned that they have been \"betrayed\" by the release of the iPad mini in a brief seven months after the splashy release of their now pass\u00e9 iPad. All of a sudden, as in the world of Louis CK, this perfect jewel-like device, the iPad 3, which was worth $800 seven months ago and has a visual display that was unimaginable even three years ago as part of a consumer product \u2013 this gift from consumer-electronics heaven \u2013 seems a bit shabby to some, because it doesn't even have a Lightning connector, or its microchip is not the latest iteration. </p> <p>The iPad 3, when it was introduced, inducted average users into the tech aristocracy, and now, seven months later, they may perceive themselves to be among the serfs. This is ridiculous. There is absolutely no purpose or function for the iPad mini that the iPad 3 doesn't serve except to allow Apple to provide a similar product to the Google Nexus and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD. </p> <p>Part of this is the psychology of consumers, Wensma concedes. \"We want something new, something pretty, the next shiny thing,\" he says. As a designer, he knows that his peers have to serve that desire for the next novel thing. </p> <p>But part of this, Wensma says, is because of product makers. He detests \"<a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/global-cio/interviews/apples-planned-obsolescence-customer-rev/240002583\">planned obsolescence</a>\", the wasteful system by which companies \u2013 many of them making personal electronics \u2013 put out shoddy or inadequate products simply because they know that, in six months or a year, they'll put out a new one.</p> <p>Consider that Apple, for instance, introduced the new iPad mini, the iPhone 5 and the new iPod touch within three weeks of each other, and largely within less than a year of the last iteration of those products. </p> <p>We know this guarantees a stream of revenues for companies like Apple, or Google or Samsung, which can master the perfect cycle of innovation and lust for new products that can keep consumers packing stores for years on end. It prevents financial worries companies have after introducing something like those of the first iPhone or the BlackBerry which, sweeping the world quickly, also quickly reached almost total saturation. That allowed Wall Street analysts to wonder where these companies would find \"the next big thing\" to guarantee growth \u2013 always, infinite financial growth. Apple may have billions of dollars of cash on hand, but in order to survive in a competitive world, it has to find billions more every year. </p> <p>We are all willing participants in this game of manipulation. Wensma <a href=\"http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1z3ig/DarcIssue1/resources/34.htm\">wrote</a> in a recent comment piece:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Obsolescence plays into a human psychological weakness and companies are very good at making use of it in order to sell more products.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But perhaps it's time to grow up and break the cycle. To respect these thoughtfully created and designed devices for what they are: devices, not new gods to be worshipped. To understand that we should use electronics until they don't work anymore, not until we get distracted or bored by some other device. That would force companies to create better, more reliable products. It would also save us, as consumers, thousands of dollars in our budgets that we currently spend on serving our whims rather than on obtaining something great.</p>",

Company-wise, Quantcast has seen great adoption in the UK with an increase in client growth of several hundred percent year-on-year. Taking a wider view, this year we are seeing the industry take slow but sure steps toward recognising that when a consumer makes a purchase, it was the result of a series of ads \u2013 not just the last one they saw or clicked. This may sound minor, but it transforms the dynamic of the whole display advertising landscape \u2013 and puts the focus back to what it has always been about, which is effective communication with the right audience.</p> <h2>What are the watershed moments in the industry that have given you inspiration this year?</h2> <p>Real-time advertising powered by real-time bidding (RTB) saw the industry begin to refashion display advertising based on real-time audience targeting and segmentation. However, after the initial fanfare and anticipation, it was clear that RTB was not delivering on its promise to improve campaign performance, despite the dramatic improvements in technical infrastructure.</p> <p>At Quantcast, we have been focused on the new rules for getting RTB to live up to its potential. Standard industry practice seems to be splitting the funnel into prospecting and retargeting, and then having a collection of different segments within prospecting (defined by human hypothesis). In contrast, Quantcast doesn't segment audiences in this traditional fashion, but instead takes a comprehensive view of internet media consumption patterns. This helps advertisers understand what makes their best customers unique and matches that profile against the entire web user base to find more of their best customers. This is done across the complete sales funnel, as the consumer moves from brand awareness through consideration and eventually to purchase. Quantcast's solution combines one of the world's largest media consumption data sets with advanced predictive modelling and real-time delivery to provide impression-level targeting that helps advertisers effectively reach the people \"most like\" their most valuable customers.</p> <p>The success of our method is recognised by our clients through the results they see. For example, a recent campaign for a large mobile provider, in which the cost per acquisition (CPA) was forecast to be just over \u00a3100, saw this reduced to around \u00a312 to \u00a315. It is results like this that are leading to the growth referenced above.</p> <p>Further endorsement comes from the data analytics team at a leading advertising agency, who compared the main ad technology partners in the market to see how each affected a consumer's path to purchase. Their results show that Quantcast \"vastly outperforms\" all other providers.</p> <p>As well as endorsing Quantcast's approach, these findings are also indicative of a shift in the industry, with RTB delivering on its promise. This is highly positive for the whole sector.</p> <p>To quote Michael McFaul, a democracy expert who serves on the US National Security Council, \"In retrospect, all revolutions seem inevitable. Beforehand, all revolutions seem impossible.\"</p> <p>From the outset, based on our in-depth understanding of media consumption and deep roots in technology, Quantcast believed that things could be done differently to make display advertising more effective. Specifically, we knew that a full funnel approach could be taken to audience targeting, rather than the traditional method of segmentation. This could be done in real time and based on user behaviour throughout the complete sales funnel from brand, consideration through to purchase.</p> <p>The overall result is more effective campaigns proven by last ad seen attribution as well as more advanced pathway attribution models. As is always the case when accepted wisdom is challenged, it has taken time for our focus on this to be both proved and acknowledged. However, the watershed moment is not so much that our method of targeting works so well, but that we are now increasingly seeing evidence that the market is starting to understand and adopt more advanced attribution modelling. This includes path way analysis which reveals how value is added to an advertiser's campaign, in contrast to last ad seen which does not always highlight the value a vendor has bought.</p> <h2>What's next in display advertising? Is the way in which we serve advertising today as sophisticated as it could be?</h2> <p>Using the \"most valuable customer\" model to serve ads that are relevant to each (anonymous) individual user is a far cry from dividing people into \"intender segments\" and, for example, showing an airline ad to everyone who has looked at a holiday website. However, it is still early days, and everyone is still learning.</p> <p>Real-time media as a new medium has exposed the need for new ways to do business. How should agencies and advertisers buy these impressions that are based on direct matches to their target audience? Clearly this requires a completely different approach to trading media, such as moving away from the commonly used cost per thousand (CPM), as CPA becomes a better real-time pricing model and utilising comprehensive attribution methods rather than last ad seen or clicked.</p> <p>In the longer term, the true performance starting to happen in display will start to be realised by other formats (such as video) as they begin to understand and adopt the attribution model.</p> <h2>How are the changes in advertising reflected in the talent it requires?</h2> <p>Advertising has traditionally focused on attracting creative and planning talent for obvious and understandable reasons. However, as the sector relies increasingly on technology to deliver performance campaigns, we are seeing the demand for technical and analytical skills becoming equally important.</p> <p>This mix of creative and technical conveys the changes that the advertising industry is currently witnessing as it transforms to embrace the digital environment.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Department store chain Debenhams has announced plans to open 17 new stores as it defied the gloom on the high street by reporting a 4.2% rise in pre-tax profits.</p> <p>The UK's second-largest department store group, behind John Lewis, said on Thursday that the new premises will take its British estate to 171 shops and allow it to hire an extra 1,700 people.</p> <p>The expansion plan is part of the chain's commitment to \"reinvigorating the British high street\", and builds on nine new store openings last year. The company is also in the process of modernising its existing tired-looking stores.</p> <p>Chief executive Michael Sharp said that retailers were battling against a \"very difficult market\", but that Debenhams, which reported full-year pre-tax profits of \u00a3158.3m, expects to continue bucking the trend. Its shares, which have risen by 59% over the past year, were up 9.5% to 119.3p by mid-afternoon on Thursday.</p> <p>\"We believe that customers are acclimatised to the new economic reality,\" he said. \"While we don't anticipate a significant change in the economic environment in 2013, we expect to make further progress during the year.\"</p> <p>Debenhams said tie-ups with fashion designers Henry Holland and Julien MacDonald had helped the retailer gain a greater share of the highly competitive womenswear market.</p> <p>The retailer is also pushing ahead with its overseas expansion and increased its target for new foreign franchise store openings from 130 to 150, with a particular focus on the Middle East and Asia.</p> <p>Debenhams also benefited from booming online sales, with internet revenue up 40% on last year to \u00a3250.6m, prompting it to increase its online target to \u00a3500m-\u00a3600m.</p> <p>The news came as internet-online fashion retailer Asos reported a 40% rise in annual profits to \u00a344.5m. The company, which claims to be the world's most viewed fashion website by 15-to-34-year-olds, said sales grew by 64% at its international sites in the US, Australia, Germany, France, Italy and Spain. UK sales, where the company is more established, increased by 10%.</p> <p>Nick Robertson, Asos's chief executive, said the company would open local-language sites for Russia and China next year.</p> <p>Asos's shares, which have almost doubled over the past year, were 5.4% down to \u00a323.59 by mid-afternoon on Thursday.</p>",
  "<p>As Portsmouth football club, founded in 1898, edges towards a takeover by supporters seeking to grasp it as their own, they are starting to look back too, at a bust, broken and bizarre period for their club, as if waking from a nightmare.</p> <p>The Pompey Supporters' Trust, fans who have devoted oceans of time to the battle for the soul of their club, remains the preferred bidder to buy it out of its second administration, against the intense, furious opposition of Balram Chainrai, a lender of money from Hong Kong. Chainrai \u2013 with a mortgage over the club's assets to secure \u00a317m owing to him from loans made at eye-watering rates of interest \u2013 is last man standing from Pompey's extraordinary, bloody chronicle of rapidly changing overseas&#xa0;owners.</p> <p>First, now looking like a model of good sense, was Milan Mandaric, who bought Portsmouth in 1999 from a previous financial crisis then cashed in around \u00a350m personally when he sold it as a Premier League club in 2006 to Alexandre \"Sacha\" Gaydamak. The football agent Pini Zahavi introduced Gaydmak, whom he knew through connections in Israel, and Zahavi has confirmed he was paid a commission for&#xa0;doing so.</p> <p>An Israeli-Russian living in Paris, Gaydamak was only 29 when he bought his Premier League asset, but always claimed it was his money, not linked to his father, Arkadi, a Russian who in October 2009 was prosecuted for money laundering. That charge was dropped this year when he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge.</p> <p>Under Gaydamak, his chief executive Peter Storrie, and the manager Harry Redknapp, Portsmouth spent their Premier League gold, and a fortune of Gaydamak's money, accumulating players on enormous wages while investing comparative peanuts in the club's infrastructure. Pompey won the FA Cup in 2008, making a financial loss that year of \u00a317m, and were facing collapse just months after Sol Campbell, Lassana Diarra and Nico Krancjar ran around Wembley with the cup.</p> <p>Sacha Gaydamak's money troubles coincided with a collapse in his father's fortunes, but his spokespeople said the global recession was Sacha's undoing, and that he had allowed Storrie and Redknapp too much freedom with his money. In August 2009 Sacha was negotiating to sell the club to Sulaiman al-Fahim, a central figure in Dubai's property bubble, and originally frontman for Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan's purchase of Manchester City, before being moved aside.</p> <p>Fahim delayed, and Storrie, again with Zahavi's contacts, said he had found hugely wealthy buyers for the club from the Middle East. That deal was fronted by Ali al-Faraj, a Saudi Arabian who never actually came to England at any point during his involvement as the owner of Porstmouth football club.</p> <p>Gaydamak was preparing to sell the club to Faraj when sources close to him say he was spooked by the mention of Chainrai's name, and that of Chainrai's partner, Levi Kushnir, as possible financiers of the Faraj consortium. Chainrai and Kushnir had shortly before that won a court case in Israel against Arkadi Gaydamak, who had failed to pay them \u00a318m owing on a deal to buy their property company, Ameris.</p> <p>Micah Hall, a Portsmouth supporters' trust member and writer who has dug deeply into the tangled history of the club during the chaos which followed, has reported that Arkadi Gaydamak was also being chased for money owed to a money lender in Israel, Shelly Narkis.</p> <p>On 29 August 2009, Sacha Gaydamak sold the 111-year-old English south coast football club to Fahim, rather than the Israeli consortium he suspected were operating with Faraj as a front. Storrie fumed publicly that they had missed a golden opportunity in Faraj and his backers. Fahim, then, did not have the money required to dig Portsmouth out of its downward plummet and after just six weeks the new consortium, via a company registered in the British Virgin Islands owned by Faraj, did take over.</p> <p>The new ownership's most visible representative, immediately, intensely involved in running the club, was a belligerent Israeli, Daniel Azougy. He was soon exposed as a convicted fraudster, disqualified from acting as a lawyer in Israel for 14 years, who had just seven months earlier been given a suspended prison sentence for handing false documents to the Israeli stock exchange.</p> <p>Hall has reported that Azougy was in effect working for Narkis, seeking to collect on Arkadi Gaydamak's debts, from the club's expected Premier League windfalls. Azougy has always denied that he works with Narkis. In January 2009 Itzik Kornfein, the chairman of Beitar Jerusalem, which had been owned by Arkadi Gaydamak, held a press conference, saying that a month earlier Azougy, claiming to be a Gaydamak representative, had demanded Kornfein transfer large sums of money out of the football club, some to his own account. Kornfein had refused.</p> <p>The London-based lawyer Mark Jacob, who acted for the Faraj consortium and worked alongside Azougy, always said they were expecting major funding from a bank, which was pulled just before they took over. So, as it turned out, Chainrai, via another offshore company, Portpin, did lend money to Portsmouth to back the Faraj consortium, \u00a36.5m on 6 October 2009. Chainrai secured those loans with a debenture over Fratton Park and all Portsmouth's assets, a position which, two administrations and a disastrous sale of the club later, still maintains.</p> <p>Chainrai has always denied he and his partner, Kushnir, were drawn to Portsmouth by any connection with the money they were owed in Israel by Arkadi Gaydamak. Chainrai has portrayed himself, throughout these three years' financial involvement with Portsmouth, as a reluctant owner who lent money to the club because it was in crisis and the people in the consortium behind Faraj asked him to.</p> <p>The interest charged by Chainrai on his loans has never been itemised in detail, but senior Portsmouth sources believe the \u00a317m still owed to him includes compound interest at high rates. Hall was in the high court after the club collapsed into insolvency in February 2010, and heard that an initial \u00a36m loaned in was due to be repaid with \u00a31m interest within two months, an annual interest rate of 130%.</p> <p>The club's bank account was frozen when Chainrai first loaned money in, after Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs issued a winding-up petition for \u00a312.4m unpaid tax and VAT. The expected fortunes from Premier League TV rights payments, however, and the sale of players ordered by Azougy, did not materialise because the Premier League withheld Pompey's cash to pay other clubs owed money.</p> <p>Chainrai loaned more money in, up to \u00a318.5m by 27 October 2009, according to the subsequent report by the first administrator, Andrew Andronikou of Hacker Young. In January 2010 the Premier League embargo was lifted, and following the sale of Youn\u00e9s Kaboul to Tottenham Hotspur, \u00a34m was immediately transferred out of Portsmouth, to Portpin.</p> <p>In February 2010 Chainrai personally took ownership of the club, replacing Faraj, who had never been to Fratton Park. Chainrai assessed that \u00a335m more was needed to keep Pompey trading, and so three weeks later he declared the club insolvent and put it into administration, with Andronikou appointed as the administrator.</p> <p>While creditors, including HMRC, lost many millions, Chainrai's involvement with Portsmouth since has been an exercise in trying to get his money back. His representatives accept that remains his motivation now, in opposing the supporters' trust takeover campaign and seeking to buy the club back himself. However, they argue Chainrai wants to put the club on a sound financial footing, otherwise he would not be able to sell it on at a value he hopes will see himself repaid.</p> <p>In June 2011 Chainrai, who took the club over from administration the first time, did sell, to Vladimir Antonov, a Russian banker. Chainrai retained security over the assets of Antonov's company, CSI. In November Antonov was arrested for alleged bank fraud in Lithuania, which he denies, and in the fallout, Chainrai's security was transferred back on to Pompey itself, and the club went into administration, again.</p> <p>This second administration, handled by Trevor Birch, of PKF, is culminating in the bitter battle between Chainrai and the PST, supporters who are determined to end this devastating period and own the club mutually, democratically, themselves. Declared preferred bidders after the Football League board failed to approve Chainrai's bid, Ashley Brown, the trust's chairman, says: \"We are confident that soon we will finally be free of the succession of distant owners who have no passion for Pompey. Historically, football clubs were founded in their communities, something often forgotten in the modern professional English game. We hope to bring Pompey back into the heart of ours.\"</p> <p>If future generations care as much for football as the campaigners fighting for its soul now, they will surely look back at this strange period; the greatest ever boom when, in some fundamental way, the game mislaid its compass.</p>",

He's also a high school student. In fact, he counts the mother of one of his school's aspiring athletes as his first ever sale. \"I remember the satisfying feeling of placing a hefty check in my pocket\", he recalls. \"Before turning it in to the finance department.\"</p> <p>Miller is one of thousands of US teenagers who have participated in the <a href=\"http://www.ja.org/involved/involved_students_comp_n_america_co.shtml\" title=\"\">JA Company of the Year</a> competition. Designed by youth charity<a href=\"http://www.ja.org/\" title=\"\"> Junior Achievement</a>, the competition invites young people to build their enterprise skills by setting up their own company.</p> <p>\"This [the competition] gives them a great grounding and foundational understanding of what it takes to start and run a business,\" says Stephanie Bell, spokesperson for Junior Achievement (JA). \"Because they might have a great idea, but just not know how to go about getting it started.\"</p> <p>The impact on these young people's futures is self-evident. Bell cites a long list of successful entrepreneurs to have passed through the ranks of Junior Achievement. The ripples spread further too. Employment is one of the central issues in the current US presidential election campaign: how to create American jobs, and how to keep them. JA's Company of the Year taps into precisely that agenda.</p> <p>Bell adds: \"In the US, small businesses are the engine of job creation. JA believes in the importance of fostering an entrepreneurial spirit among young people \u2026 because frankly that's what is going to help the US remain competitive in the global market.\"</p> <p>Enterprise skills are only one aspect of JA's suite of two dozen programmes. The remainder focus on either work readiness or financial literacy. Employers regularly complain about young people being ill equipped for the world of work. Through its work with schools, JA seeks to tackle that criticism head-on.</p> <h2>Business buy-in</h2> <p>One of the critical reasons behind the charity's long-running success (it's been going since 1919) lies in its ability to engage the business community. Companies not only help to financially support the work of the charity's 121 offices across the US, but they donate staff time too.</p> <p>AT&amp;T is one such example. Under its newly-launched AT&amp;T Aspire Mentoring Academy, the US communications firm aims to provide one million hours of mentoring support over the next five years \u2013 much of that delivered by working with Junior Achievement.</p> <p>One of the academy's core activities is a job-mentoring programme, which sees groups of high school students spend a day at the company's offices. As well as gaining a taste of the workplace and career advice, the students are set a business problem to solve.</p> <p>\"The problem is set around a real-life issue that an AT&amp;T employee might have, whether that's sales, project management, customer service, human resources technician, and so on. That way students can make the connection between the workplace and their education\", says Brad Yates, the academy's director.</p> <p>Bell insists that such insights from the workplace are \"complementary\" to the school system, not in competition. Junior Achievement takes what students are learning in maths, science, technology and other core curriculum subjects, and demonstrates how these tangibly play out in the world of work.</p> <p>The educational benefits to the students are not only clear but calculable, according to Yates. He cites a study by <a href=\"http://weteachscience.org/\" title=\"\">We Teach Science</a>, another online e-mentoring charity with which AT&amp;T partners. For every hour of mentoring, students' test results were shown to increase by an average of 1.6%. \"That means we'll take someone who has a low likelihood of success, and place them in a position to be successful in high school,\" Yates says.</p> <p>Companies stand to benefit too. Many employees state that volunteering in their communities gives a sense of satisfaction. In harsh commercial terms, that feeds into better retention levels and higher morale. For firms that recruit from nearby schools and universities, any step to increases the capacity of the local talent pool makes bottom-line sense.</p> <h2>Global movement</h2> <p>Junior Achievement isn't just a US phenomenon. The charity now counts links in 120 countries, extending the total reach of its programmes to around 10.5 million young people.</p> <p>In the UK, it trades under the name of <a href=\"http://www.young-enterprise.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Young Enterprise</a>. Financial services firm <a href=\"http://www.capitalone.co.uk/aboutus/csr-community.jsf\" title=\"\">Capital One</a> is among its major corporate supporters. For the last three years, employees from the company's main office in Nottingham have been running sessions in financial literacy in local schools.</p> <p>Advice about money management, debt and personal finance in general often gets overlooked in the classroom due to more pressing social concerns, says the company's head of corporate responsibility Alison Gardner. Teachers themselves aren't necessarily that clued up on the subject either. In contrast, Capital One's employees live and breathe this stuff. \"They are using it every day at work, so why not in the schools too?\" Gardner states.</p> <p>Gardner admits that there might be \"a degree of cynicism\" about a company's motive for going into a school or about their ability to deliver. That's where the charity's heritage and brand comes in. \"By partnering with Youth Enterprise, which is unbiased, has a great reputation and strong links with local schools, it really helps us to engage with students in a different way.\"</p> <p><em>Oliver Balch is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571259250\" title=\"\"><em>India Rising: Tales from a Changing Nation</em></a><em>, published by Faber</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>You could say <a href=\"http://peterfetterman.com/artists/pentti-sammallahti/\" title=\"\">Pentti Sammallahti</a> was <a href=\"http://www.valokuvataiteenmuseo.fi/en/component/content/article/10321\" title=\"\">born for photography</a>. His grandmother, Hildur Larsson, was an accomplished Swedish photographer for the Helsinki newspaper Kaiku in the 1900s. He grew up surrounded by her images. His father took him, aged nine, to the famous <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/archives_highlights_06_1955\" title=\"\">Family of Man</a> group exhibition, curated by <a href=\"http://www.atgetphotography.com/The-Photographers/Edward-Steichen.html\" title=\"\">Edward Steichen</a>, when it came to Helsinki in 1959. From that moment, the young Sammallahti knew what he wanted to do with his life.</p> <p>At 11, he made his first photographs \u2013 small contact prints of everyday life in Helsinki. In 1964, he joined the <a href=\"http://www.kameraseura.fi/english/history-of-the-helsinki-camera-club/\" title=\"\">Helsinki Camera Club</a> and blossomed. He had his first solo show in 1971, aged 20. The earliest photograph in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1907893261/dewilewispublish\" title=\"\">Here, Far Away</a>, a beautiful retrospective book of his work just published in Britain, dates from 1964, when he was 14. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/gallery/2012/oct/25/photography#/?picture=398335241&amp;index=7\" title=\"\">A man sleeps in a doorway, oblivious to the bird that pecks at the earth in the foreground</a>. It is an almost austere image, formally accomplished and understated in its arrangement of vertical and horizontal lines: the doorframe, the wood panels, the bricked pavement. But there is an odd melancholic poetry too, not least in the two stark white lines someone has painted on the doorframe, one of which seems to rise, dreamlike, out of the sleeping man's outstretched palm. Above the bird, on the wall, someone has chalked a neat love heart with an arrow though it. Even at 14, Sammallahti's eye was drawn to the quiet illumination of everyday life. As he grew older, his <a href=\"http://www.candacedwan.com/#New_York/Artists/Pentti_Sammallahti\" title=\"\">vision deepened and widened, becoming both more poetic and more austere</a>.</p> <p>The book is divided into nine chapters, <a href=\"http://www.photoeye.com/gallery/forms2/homepage.cfm?image=1&amp;id=68149&amp;imagePosition=1&amp;Door=1&amp;Portfolio=Portfolio7&amp;Gallery=1\" title=\"\">each a record of Sammallahti's restless wanderings</a> through Finland, Norway, Britain, eastern Europe, Africa, China and India. His first published portfolio, a limited edition of 200 signed silver gelatin prints in a box, featured images taken in the west of Ireland in 1978. It was dedicated to Paul Strand, but his photographs of rural Ireland, as well as those taken in Hungary and Romania, have more in common with <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.PhotographerDetail_VPage&amp;l1=0&amp;pid=2K7O3R135R3G&amp;nm=Josef%20Koudelka\" title=\"\">Josef Koudelka's images of similar people and places</a>. Sammallahti's gaze, though, is warmer, more intimate and, at times, more epic. A landscape in Erd\u0151b\u00e9nye, Hungary, taken in 1979, looks like a monochrome still from a beautiful film, or a landscape painting drained of colour. There is something both old-fashioned and timeless about it. <a href=\"http://prod-images.exhibit-e.com/templates_exhibit-e_com/Erdobenye_Hungary_19790.jpg\" title=\"\">A horse-drawn carriage transports two farmers and several stacks of hay.</a> The wet road sweeps off into a misty backdrop, where two faraway steeples are divided by a telegraph pole rising out of tall grasses, silver-grey in the muted light.

Here, the blankness of the landscape, shading into grey forests or skies, is an atmosphere in itself. Wolfish dogs and solitary birds feature in many of the images, survivors in a harsh, beautiful environment where everything \u2013 rivers, lakes, skies and bare trees \u2013 seems frozen into stillness. He also captures the changing of the seasons \u2013 snow giving way to mud, a different kind of grey making the landscape an entirely different world.</p> <p>For all that, Sammallahti's vision is also a lyrical one. He often captures humans and animals in worlds of their own, lost in reverie: dogs chase birds, birds cautiously approach humans or circle above them. Often, his camera captures a single figure in a dreamlike landscape: <a href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lo2s0znz2U1qhqfw3o1_r1_500.jpg\" title=\"\">a man walking down a road in a silent, snow-covered world at dusk, his dog waiting</a>, patient but alert, ahead of him. You can almost hear the crunch of snow underfoot. But what is most palpable is the silence of the surroundings. Looking at the photograph, you feel on the threshold of another, more mysterious world that is indeed here and far away.</p> <h2>Now see this</h2> <p>The Japanese photographer <a href=\"http://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/\" title=\"\">Hiroshi Sugimoto</a> is most famous for the series <a href=\"http://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/seascape.html\" title=\"\">Seascapes</a>, for which he used a large format camera to take long exposures of the sea and sky in various locations around the globe.

  "<p><strong>What will the open data user group be doing?</strong></p> <p>In order for the government to release the right data we, as a community, need to act with a single voice and clearly set out the argument that certain open datasets have the potential to deliver broad benefits. The government doesn't always find it easy to understand what open data users want and need, and which datasets would have the biggest impact if released for free, so we're acting as the bridge between the open data community and government.</p> <p><strong>What do you want to achieve in the role?</strong></p> <p>I'd like ODUG to be recognised for success in representing open data users at the heart of government, by targeting public sector data that has a clear benefit in being released for free, and by working with the government to make that happen.</p> <p>I would also like to help more public sector bodies discover that releasing open data can result in great benefits for their own organisations. In many cases, opening up data publicly drives the improved use of data and management information internally \u2013 which can lead to a better understanding of your own organisation and help drive innovation and higher performance.</p> <p><strong>What are the challenges facing the open data agenda?</strong></p> <p>One of the key obstacles we need to overcome is to convince public sector data owners or custodians to release their data without restrictions, either through licensing or costs. There is also a longer term challenge of stimulating a culture change across the whole of the public sector to embed a presumption to publish, and making this part of day-to-day business. A number of organisations make a tidy profit charging for data but we don't see this as being the best way for the UK to get the full benefit from the underlying costs of producing these datasets. Convincing people isn't always easy, especially when departments are operating under spending constraints.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Do citizens need to be better engaged to get the most from open data?</strong></p> <p>Some citizens are already actively involved. Open data opens up the door for technology-based start-ups to get into business or to drive new business. But this is only possible when individuals and organisations have the skills and understanding to analyse and produce insights from the data. ODUG is working closely with the <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/\" title=\"\">Open Data Institute</a> to help foster a new ecosystem of individuals and organisations so that we all realise the value of open data. However, many citizens still need to be informed about the potential of open data and what this can mean to them as individuals. The average person is getting on with their life and will only interact with the government driven by an immediate need for a public service. One of the challenges is to demonstratethat it can lead to benefits on all sides; for citizens, organisations and for government itself.</p> <p><strong>What's your background and how will it inform your role?</strong></p> <p>My first degree is in electronic and electrical engineering, and I have previously worked with and for organisations of all sizes, from start-ups to global corporates. I also have five years experience working in central government. So, I have a strong private sector background, coupled with hands-on experience of policy design and delivery. I understand the challenges on both sides of the fence.</p> <p><strong>Is there enough consistency in approach between departments?</strong></p> <p>Whitehall culture can seem strange, especially when you first arrive from the private sector. The common theme I have noticed across central government is that there can be a reticence to try something new, for fear of failure. In my opinion, a culture which allows people to try and fail increases levels of aspiration. The first law of innovation and improvement is that appropriate levels of risk need to be taken, and failure needs to be tolerated and viewed as an opportunity to learn and improve.</p> <p><strong>What has been your biggest achievement?</strong></p> <p>Being part of a UK start-up which went public on Nasdaq in 1996; personally turning around two technology companies \u2013 both of which were successfully acquired within a year of my involvement \u2013 and completing my MBA at London Business School whilst working full-time.</p> <p><strong>Who, or what, has taught you the most about leadership?</strong></p> <p>My worst personal experiences of different leaders have taught me more than the positive ones. For certain individuals who lead entirely from the front it's all fine whilst everything goes well. When it doesn't they can falter \u2013 either to protect themselves or because they simply don't know what to do next. I have learnt two things from this \u2013 the importance of maintaining strong leadership whilst working as a team, and the importance of asking for help when you need it \u2013 wherever you are in your career, or whatever your job.</p> <p><strong>What's your leadership style?</strong></p> <p>My underlying leadership skills were developed in start-up environments where job title and hierarchy count for less than raw intellect, actual delivery and individual and group achievements. I'm fairly informal in my approach but I like to cut to the chase quickly when I get down to business. I try to relate to everyone on an individual basis and pull teams together in a way which plays to each person's strengths.</p> <p>I always aspire to lead a 'no-surprises', 'no-blame' culture where problems can be surfaced earlier rather than later. To achieve this, your team needs to have faith in your full support for them at all times, and to know that you will take personal responsibility \u2013 whatever happens.</p> <p><strong>If you could take three things to a desert island what would they be?</strong></p> <p>My iPad (even without an internet connection), a supply of decent red wine, and a feather pillow.</p> <p><em>The ODUG have just released a form on </em><a href=\"http://www.data.gov.uk/odug\" title=\"\"><em>data.gov.uk</em></a><em> for businesses and individuals to highlight those datasets which would be the best to release for free</em></p>",
  "<p>Tracey Thorn's fourth solo album arrives a few months before her autobiography, the splendidly titled <a href=\"http://www.littlebrown.co.uk/Books/detail.page?isbn=9781844088669\" title=\"\">Bedsit Disco Queen</a>. The book acts not just as Thorn's memoir, but as a eulogy for an almost forgotten era of pop. You might call it the unrevived 80s: an earnest, cardigan-clad and Doc Marten-shod world of benefit gigs and ill-tempered interviews about ideology, of \"musical delegates\" heading off to Russia to perform at the <a href=\"http://www.wfdy.org/\" title=\"\">World Federation of Democratic Youth</a>'s Festival of Youth and Students (\"In between the bands, two men sat on the stage and had a debate about 'music and the state'\"). It was a world in which Thorn and her partnership with Ben Watt in <a href=\"http://www.ebtg.com/\" title=\"\">Everything But the Girl</a> were deeply rooted: at one point, she details her own game attempt to turn the teeny readers of <a href=\"http://likepunkneverhappened.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Smash Hits</a> away from the distractions of hunky John Taylor and Howard Jones and on to a book called The British in Northern Ireland: The Case for Withdrawal.</p> <p>It all comes as a useful reminder that there was a time when the notion of a Christmas album by Tracey Thorn \u2013 better yet, a Christmas album by Tracey Thorn featuring a guest appearance by Green Gartside, the Deleuze and Gramsci-referencing frontman of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vVYNLBHkq8\" title=\"\">Scritti Politti</a> \u2013 would have seemed like a music press hoax: have yourself a merry little Christmas, if you're in the business of allowing commodity fetishism to distract you from the terrible social injustices that are happening under your nose. Indeed, even after that era ended, she would have seemed an unlikely candidate for an album of seasonal cheer. It's not just that her voice and songs alike incline towards the dolorous. Even when Everything But the Girl hit the dancefloor in considerable style \u2013 their 1996 album Walking Wounded <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBQmlWVamFM\" title=\"\">assimilated house and drum'n'bass influences</a> into their sound with a remarkable ease \u2013 the songs themselves remained resolutely downcast. There's also the fact that, from Everything But the Girl's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4QiRP9p7vs\" title=\"\">early flirtations with Cole Porter</a> and Stan Getz to her latterday <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlJbTxelw6k\" title=\"\">collaborations with Berlin-based techno auteur Ewan Pearson</a> (who produces again), Thorn's music has invariably been the product of quiet good taste, and quiet good taste isn't really a phrase you associate with Christmas music. Nor is sharp, stark realism, something else Thorn's music tends to deal in: Christmas songs are about the construction of an appealing fantasy, a three-minute suspension of disbelief.</p> <p>In the event, all the factors that should count against Tinsel and Lights being a success actually work to its advantage. The quiet good taste is much in evidence: there's only one canonical Christmas favourite, Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Elsewhere, she picks stuff from the oeuvres of Randy Newman and the White Stripes, the latter's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96KLflS5f6g\" title=\"\">In the Cold Cold Night</a> rendered as a delicate shimmer. She duets with Gartside on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4haoM6t2LM\" title=\"\">Taking Down the Tree</a>, from Low's 1999 EP <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IippcraBPKA\" title=\"\">Christmas</a>, one of the few successful alt-rock Christmas records precisely because it sounds heartfelt, with no mitigating sheen of irony. She locates the emotions that lurk beneath the archness of Stephin Merrit's songwriting. Like a Snowman was originally performed by a New York drag cabaret duo called Kiki and Herb, but Thorn strips away any affection: the end result, delicately orchestrated, blessed with a beautiful melody, is so heartrending you forget you're listening to the deeply improbable sound of the woman from Everything But the Girl proposing you take all your clothes off and dance in a&#xa0;snowstorm.</p> <p>Likewise, the persistent ache in Thorn's voice lends an affecting depth to Tinsel and Lights: sounding a little dolorous about the festive season isn't so bizarre, given how wretched many people feel by 27 December. The opener, Joy, one of two self-penned songs, isn't about Christmas so much as its myth. The protagonist is desperate to believe that, this year, she can regain her sense of childhood wonder about the whole business; the way Thorn sings it suggests it's a folorn hope. The title track, meanwhile, features a character looking back at an ostensibly perfect Christmas past, with a vague intimation that it wasn't really that perfect: \"Something almost true was in the air,\" she sings.</p> <p>The most surprising thing about Tinsel and Lights might not be that it's a Christmas album by Tracey Thorn, but that it manages to transcend its genre and the season it's intended to soundtrack, perhaps because it forsakes any of the usual musical signifiers: you'll search in vain for a hint of sleighbell. With a couple of judicious pokes of the fast-forward button, you can listen to it on a wet October afternoon when Christmas seems as far away as Neptune, without feeling suicidal as a result. Among the ranks of seasonal albums, that might well make it&#xa0;unique.</p>",

  "<p>Prank TV can be hilarious when it creates absurd situations to tease the rich and powerful. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRAbnZb-Oqw\" title=\"\">Justin Timberlake</a> was on the edge of tears after \"taxmen\" threatened to requisition his dog; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5P9J1wCgNM\" title=\"\">Ali G persuaded a former UN secretary general</a> to justify Disneyland's absence from the general assembly; and <a href=\"http://www.e4.com/video/4b8zTkzibsMbmY2zDEJzfU/play.e4\" title=\"\">E4's Fonejacker</a> talked a model agency into bringing his whole family along to a casting.</p> <p>But E4's latest show, The Work Experience, has a cheaper target in its crosshairs. It is premised on humiliating those willing to do anything to get a job in the glitzy world of high fashion. Celebrities such as grime rapper Lethal Bizzle play bit parts to trick two real-life young hopefuls into thinking that they're unpaid interns at a fashion PR agency, Grade PR. In fact, hidden cameras are everywhere, and the young interns in episode one, Thomas and Aquila, have a host of fake colleagues who engineer nightmare situations for them to create what's billed as \"an internship from hell\".</p> <p>Some of these incidents could be pretty funny in a conventional comedy. One scenario sees Shussi, the stressed creative director, deciding to shower an albino model with fake tan before covering his back by blaming the intern: \"You got me an albino model and blacked him up. And you fucking blinded him!\" Indeed, the show only works because interns patiently get on with their work amid farcical conditions.</p> <p>It would not have been possible to create a prank show in which the power dynamics were inverted, with the interns mocking the bosses, as the young people would have simply been fired. Clearly, the programme-makers recognised this could make its audiences feel guilty about laughing. So a crude satire on the egos of absurd fashionistas is tacked on, as agency MD Joanna tries to sleep with the models and Shussi routinely bursts into tears through his manscara. The subtext is that it's all right because we're laughing at how ridiculous the fashion industry is, not that young people are prepared to humiliate themselves in their desperation to get a job.</p> <p>The audience's consciences are also meant to be assuaged by the news at the end of the show that the interns will be offered real placements at top firms \u2013 cue shots of their delighted faces, hugs and comments about how they were happy to be in on the joke. And to cover themselves for the inevitable criticism (a scene in a later episode sees the interns asked to collect sperm to artificially inseminate Joanna), the programme's press materials and website all emphasise the idea that it's OK to laugh at the interns' ordeals because it all ends up happily ever after.</p> <p>But ultimately the show leaves a bad taste in the mouth, because in real life, The Devil Pays Nada.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.internaware.org/\" title=\"\">Intern Aware</a>, we hear about examples of unambiguous exploitation on a daily basis. One fashion industry hopeful spent four months working for free to design and create a range of hats, that later were sold at a major London department store for several hundred pounds each. When she asked to keep a hat to add to her portfolio, her boss generously offered her a staff discount instead. In the basement of a major music production company, 10 unpaid interns are engaged full-time transferring albums from vinyl to MP3 for months on end. And while The Work Experience interns were trained to clean designer clothes, in one London art gallery, interns report that they learn the ropes by cleaning the loos.</p> <p>Unpaid internships are becoming a prerequisite for jobs across the whole economy, not just in the larger-than-life worlds of fashion and media. The IPPR thinktank estimates there are as many as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/sep/09/make-most-of-unpaid-internship\" title=\"\">100,000 interns</a> who are not paid the national minimum wage in Britain, in most cases doing real work that the government's lawyers say should be properly paid. Despite this, HMRC is utterly failing to enforce the minimum wage, and in our frustration, we have teamed up with employment lawyers to help interns get their pay back.</p> <p>Before the recession struck, young people didn't need to chase humiliating \"opportunities\" to work for free to avoid unemployment. Now, with youth unemployment at dangerous levels, employers have so many applicants that they often only interview candidates who have spent months as interns. In this environment, it's no surprise that as many as 150 people applied for the two fictitious internships on The Work Experience.</p>",
  "<p>There could not be a clearer case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. For the past three years there have been clear and unequivocal warnings that ash dieback could come to Britain. If action was not taken, ecologists, foresters and even some importers warned, the disease would arrive here through imports of infected seedlings from the continent. But neither this government nor its predecessor saw fit to ban them.</p> <p>In February, the first case was confirmed in Britain: in imported seedlings in a tree nursery in Buckinghamshire. Yet still the government failed to ban imports. The disease then appeared in nine more sites: all of them containing recently imported trees. Amazingly, the government still failed to act. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/04/deadly-fungus-ash-tree-imports\" title=\"\">It promised a consultation</a>, which would report at the end of this month: only then would it decide what to do.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the warnings were horribly vindicated, when the fungus was found, for the first time in Britain, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/24/ash-dieback-disease-east-anglia\" title=\"\">in mature trees growing in the wild, in Norfolk and Suffolk</a>. Now there might be no stopping it. The disease has already <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/07/disease-killing-denmarks-ash-trees\" title=\"\">affected 90% of the ash trees in Denmark</a>: here too it could do to the countryside what Dutch elm disease did in the 1960s.</p> <p>Something else happened yesterday: the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2012/10/04/chalara-fraxinea/\" title=\"\">government announced</a> that it's considering an imminent ban on imports of infected seedlings.</p> <p>You couldn't satirise this decision. The government waits until the disease is established to take the measures required to prevent its establishment.</p> <p>The Country Land and Business Association - with which I seldom find myself in agreement - has got this dead right. It's symptomatic of a wider failure to take exotic threats to our wildlife seriously.</p> <p>\"For far too long successive governments have failed to tackle the growing threat of tree diseases. <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em> [the disease sometimes known as sudden oak death] has spread like wildfire up the west coast of Britain, from Cornwall to Scotland, killing hundreds of thousands of larch trees, and it is now moving eastward. Yet a mere \u00a34m a year has been earmarked to fight it.\"</p> <p>Both Gordon Brown's administration and the current government \u2013 in particular the former environment secretaries Hilary Benn and Caroline Spelman \u2013 have a lot of explaining to do. But the overriding responsibility lies with the coalition, which, perhaps through an ideological fixation with unimpeded commerce, failed to respond even as the warnings became stark and unmistakable.</p> <p>I propose a new name for this disease, which reflects the government's astonishing and disgraceful failure to act. I think we should call it \"Cameron's contagion\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\" title=\"\">monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"You know about Gangnam Style, right?\" asked the senior South Korean Google exec, when I found myself in Seoul two weeks ago \u2013 her first question. But, while the huge viral success of Psy's hit has created a whole genre of jockey-based dance moves, Gangnam is a place, too.</p> <p>It's the Mayfair of Seoul, the high-rise district of the city just south of the river. Although it does feature one large and rather beautiful temple, Bongeun, for the most part, Gangnam is an upmarket shopping area, home to the enormous underground COEX mall (where part of the video was filmed) and the nearby boutique-lined streets of Apgujeong-dong. To see the historic Seoul, you have to cross the river, but that's not the point of Gangnam.</p> <p>The point of Gangnam is to be seen there, and the streets are full of young, well-dressed teens mingling with the super-rich of the city. Seoul is the capital of Korea; Gangnam is, as Psy says, the capital of Seoul. It's so expensive that it accounts for almost 10% of the land value of the entire country.</p> <p>The Gangnam Style phenomenon has shone a western light on K-pop too, the genre of slick, mass-produced teen-idol boy and girl bands that dominate the south-east Asian music scene. You might not have heard of it before Psy, but K-pop videos were viewed more than two billion times in 2011. The future of British pop may include acts such as A Pink and B2ST too.</p> <p>Only the very wealthy can afford to live in Gangnam \u2013 not the kids in the latest styles who hang around its huge malls.

Far from being a blessing, minerals have an adverse impact, the argument goes. This is because commodity exporters face a decline over time in the relative prices of their products and also because of the \"Dutch disease\", whereby the resource sector drives up the value of the local currency, hurting the competitiveness of manufacturing exports.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/5398.html\" title=\"\">influential study by Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner</a>, covering 97 countries between 1971-89, it was found that natural resource exporters grew at appreciably lower rates than other countries. More recent work, however, disputes the methodology used by Sachs and Warner. <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=izfIXniUJ7IC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=lederman+and+maloney+and+resource+curse&amp;ots=Jre1z6C6dR&amp;sig=_TlOp9x16plkBKUChMiFGHxHvHE#v=onepage&amp;q=lederman%20and%20maloney%20and%20resource%20curse&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Daniel Lederman and William Maloney</a>, for instance, have suggested that natural resources are neither curse nor destiny, asserting instead that it's a mixed bag: some resource-rich countries perform poorly, others do not.</p> <h2><strong>What are the relative growth figures for resource-rich and resource-poor countries?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/10/04/despite-global-slowdown-african-economies-growing-strongly-world-bank-urges-countries-spend-new-oil-gas-mineral-wealth-wisely\" title=\"\">A recent World Bank study, Africa's Pulse</a>, compared growth of Africa's resource-rich and non-resource-rich countries between 1980 and 2010. In the 1980s, both sets of countries experienced a virtual stagnation in per-capita gross domestic product. Overall, resource-rich countries were unable to harness resource wealth in the first two decades. Since 2000, however, it has been a different story: higher growth in all groups, with oil-rich countries in the lead. The oil producers achieved sustained growth over the past decade, with some growing faster than others. Angola and Equatorial Guinea experience annual average growth rates of more than 7%. At the lower end, Nigeria, Sudan and Cameroon had rates of 3-6%.</p> <h2><strong>What impact has economic growth had on poverty and inequality in Africa?</strong></h2> <p>Not much. The same World Bank study said strong economic growth over the past decade in Africa has had little impact on poverty rates. Some countries \u2013 Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon \u2013 have actually seen an increase in the percentage of their population living in extreme poverty. \"Overall, the decline in poverty rates in resource-rich countries has generally lagged that of the region's non-resource rich countries,\" said the bank. \"Income distribution remains highly unequal in most countries in the region \u2026 To a large extent, the benefits of growth have not reached the poorest segments of society.\"</p> <h2><strong>How do resource-rich countries score on accountability and governance?</strong></h2> <p>Poorly. The <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/worldwide-governance-indicators\" title=\"\">World Bank's governance indicators</a> show that oil-rich countries in Africa systematically perform worse than other country groups in terms of voice and accountability, political stability, rule of law and the control of corruption, with Chad and Sudan among the worst performers. As the World Bank notes, where governments are heavily dependent on resource rents rather than on direct taxes from citizens, \"the chain of accountability between citizens and governments can be weak. Also, natural resource abundance can be associated with weak checks and balances, because the generation of large rents motivates political elites and powerful private actors/groups to capture these rents for the benefit of a few over the common economic interest.\" Although there may be no resource curse on growth, it seems to manifest itself in relation to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/25/niger-resources-nigerien-people-video\" title=\"\">concentration of wealth and accountability</a> (video).</p> <h2><strong>What is being done to improve accountability?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/17/france-eu-transparency-resource-curse\" title=\"\">France is making a big push for the EU's directives on transparency and accounting</a>, currently making their way through the EU. The directives, which were approved by a key European parliamentary committee in September, require publicly quoted companies in the extractive industries to publish their payments to foreign governments \u2013 not just country by country, but also project by project \u2013 without exception. The directives would be in line with <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/trustlaw/news/sec-to-vote-on-conflict-minerals-resource-payments-rules\" title=\"\">US rules under the Frank-Dodd act</a>, although <a href=\"http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/vol-110/issue-10c/general-interest/api-others-sue-over-dodd-frank-payment.html\" title=\"\">are under legal challenge</a>. France wants to broaden these transparency rules to forestry and fishing eventually.</p> <h2><strong>How much do African economies depend on natural resources?</strong></h2> <p>Oil, gas and mining are important sectors and account for a major source of income. Economic rents from minerals in sub-Saharan Africa came to $169bn (\u00a3105bn) in 2010. In Nigeria and Angola, two of Africa's biggest oil producers, the combined size of the rents was more than $100bn. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/25/africa-diversify-resource-curse-thinktank\" title=\"\">Government revenues from natural resources</a> \u2013 a combination of tax and royalties \u2013 accounted, on average, for 45% of total general revenues in resource-rich countries.</p> <p>The economist <a href=\"http://users.ox.ac.uk/~econpco/research/africa.htm\" title=\"\">Paul Collier</a> says African resource reserves may be underestimated, as less exploration has taken place in Africa than in other regions. African countries' share of global reserves and production of non-fuel minerals is considerable as well.

A further 61 \"blocks\", or licences, are under environmental assessment.</p> <p>Total fines resulting from prosecutions between 2000 and 2011 came to just \u00a374,000 and no single oil company had to pay more than \u00a320,000.</p> <p>Two companies received fines of \u00a320,000: BP, for causing 28 tonnes of diesel to spill into the sea in 2002 from the Forties Alpha platform, and, a year later, Total E&amp;P, for causing six tonnes of diesel to enter the sea during a transfer between fuel tanks on the Alwyn North&#xa0;platform.</p> <p>Information about the fines was released by Decc after <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc-foi/offshore-oil-and-gas/268-121349-offshore-environmental-inspectorate.pdf\" title=\"\">a freedom of information request</a> and further inquiries by the Guardian.</p> <p>The smallest fines over this period were those imposed on two companies, Venture North Sea Oil and Knutsen OAS Shipping, of \u00a32,000 each, after 20 tonnes of crude oil was spilt during a tanker transfer on the Kittiwake platform.</p> <p>In total, 1,226 tonnes of oil were spilt into the North Sea between 2000 and 2011, <a href=\"http://og.decc.gov.uk/en/olgs/cms/data_maps/field_data/oil_spills/oil_spills.aspx\" title=\"\">according to Decc's archives</a>. Decc said there is no \"volume threshold\" determining whether a company will be prosecuted over a spill at sea, although a spill of less than five tonnes is unlikely to go to court.</p> <p>A tonne of crude oil is broadly equivalent to seven barrels, or, more precisely, 1,136 litres.</p> <p>Decc said its inspectors, all of whom have enforcement powers, judge each case separately to assess the circumstances and the seriousness of the alleged&#xa0;offence.</p> <p>Slightly different arrangements exist in Scotland from those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, for pursuing a prosecution.</p> <p>A Decc spokesman said: \"The UK has one of the toughest and most successful oil and gas regimes in the world and we work closely with industry to ensure the highest standards of environmental protection are in place and enforced.</p> <p>\"There are a number of enforcement options available to Decc, with court action reserved for serious offences. On the rare occasions legal proceedings have been deemed necessary, it is for the court to decide the level of fines to hand&#xa0;down.\"</p> <p>Environmental campaigners said it was worrying that Decc viewed itself as operating the global gold standard of offshore regulation, especially as oil companies were now pressing for permission to drill in extreme and vulnerable environments such as the Arctic.</p> <p>Vicky Wyatt, a Greenpeace campaigner, said: \"Ministers and oil companies can spout all the carefully crafted quotes they like to tell us how safe drilling at sea is. But while they're spouting these words, their rigs are all too often spouting oil into our oceans. The government should hit these companies who pollute the oceans in this way with meaningful fines.</p> <p>\"A few grand is not even a slap on the wrist for companies who pocket millions of pounds every hour.</p> <p>\"It's both staggering and wrong that some of these companies are now also drilling in the fragile and pristine Arctic, where a similar oil leak would be&#xa0;catastrophic.\"</p> <p>Speaking about the issuing of new drilling licences, the energy minister, John Hayes, said: \"Fortune has favoured the UK. Oil and gas from our waters provides around half the energy we need to heat our homes, fuel our cars and power our industry.</p> <p>\"It is the single largest industrial UK investor, supporting 440,000 jobs, and benefits the UK's trade balance to the tune&#xa0;of \u00a340bn.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This successful licensing round shows we are taking the right action to offer certainty and confidence to investors. Our fiscal regime is now encouraging small fields into production and our licensing regime supports new faces as well the big players to invest. Importantly, we are guaranteeing every last economic drop of oil and gas is produced for the benefit of the UK. It is our work with industry that is cultivating this precious resource, making our seas a fertile landscape for investors for many years to come.\"</p> <h2>Fined North Sea oils spills since 2000</h2> <p><strong>Kerr McGee North Sea (UK) Ltd \u2013 22 October 2000</strong></p> <p>Release of about 400 tones crude oil to sea from subsea pipeline: \u00a310,000 fine.

  "<p>There was something bizarre, sad and deeply unsettling about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/24/donald-trump-october-surprise-video\" title=\"\">Donald Trump's much-hyped \"bombshell\" announcement on the US presidential election</a>. Rather like a James Bond villain addressing the world from his lair, the billionaire spoke to camera via the internet to \"reveal\" that he would offer $5m to sick children if President Obama produced his college records. The only thing missing was a bomb and a timer.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the stunt had the desired effect that Trump stunts always do \u2013 lulling people into thinking that, love him or loathe him, Donald Trump is, first and foremost, a celebrity, a television star, and an entertainer. An outlandish buffoon with some of the most ridiculed hair in the world, but essentially harmless.</p> <p>However, there is another side to Trump, as the 1&#xa0;million viewers who watched my film, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01nln7g/Youve_Been_Trumped/\" title=\"\">You've Been Trumped</a>, on BBC2 this week can attest. And this Trump is not harmless.</p> <p>Trump's first career is as a property developer, and his foray into Scotland to build a golf course has resulted in the needless destruction of a <a href=\"http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/sssi/index.cfm\" title=\"\">site of special scientific interest</a>. It led to the arrest and imprisonment of myself and a colleague. Meanwhile, life has been made a misery for local residents whose only crime was wanting to live in their homes in harmony with the environment. And there is widespread fear Grampian police have been acting as Trump's private security force.</p> <p>But from the thousands of tweets and emails we have received this week following the broadcast, what really gets viewers' ire up is not so much what Trump did, and even how he behaved, but how he was able to get away with it. And this is a story that has not yet run its course.</p> <p>Trump is a businessman out to get the best deal he can. He uses his celebrity to open doors closed to others. But it is the job of our political leaders to protect the public interest.</p> <p>Trump certainly got his way when he convinced the Scottish government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/nov/03/scotland-donaldtrump\" title=\"\">to ignore years of careful environmental planning</a> and give him permission to build a luxury resort on what one scientist called \"the crown jewels of Scotland's natural heritage\".</p> <p>But perhaps more troubling is the blind eye Alex Salmond (the development is in Salmond's own constituency) and the Scottish government have turned since. When in July 2010 <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5636082/filming-donald-trumps-scottish-golf-course-will-get-you-arrested\" title=\"\">my colleague Richard Phinney and I were arrested</a> and put in an Aberdeen jail cell and charged with \"breach of the peace\" for interviewing Trump's greenkeeper, the National Union of Journalists called it an \"unprecedented\" infringement of press freedom. It was also a reflection of the kind of intimidation felt by local residents, who believed the police were firmly on Trump's side in the many disputes that arose during construction.</p> <p>We put these concerns and others to Salmond \u2013 and the cabinet secretary, John Swinney \u2013 more than two years ago. But our requests for an interview were turned down. Salmond and his ministers also passed up two opportunities to see You've Been Trumped at the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh and at dozens of cinema screenings up and down the country.</p> <p>But only now, following the public furore sparked by the film's BBC broadcast, has Salmond broken his silence, admitting the film raises deep concerns among people who have seen it. He has written to Grampian police's chief constable for an explanation.</p> <p>Why has it taken more than two years to do so? The only logical answer is that Salmond and his government have been hoping that, in their silence, the truth would not be revealed. To the residents who have had to deal with the Bond villain Trump and his cronies, Salmond's response \u2013 or the lack of one \u2013 is deeply insulting and they are right to call it a cover-up.</p> <p>And to the many people who have been shocked, dazed and saddened by what they have witnessed on the small screen this week, the implications for Scottish independence could never have been more pressing.</p>",
  "<p>Virtual visiting has become the latest craze in prisons, with at least 20 states now having some kind of video conferencing system in place. As most prisoners tend to get housed in facilities at least 100 \u2013 and often up to 500 \u2013 miles from home, frequent visits are impossible for families; so video calls at least offer the opportunity for some virtual face time.</p> <p>Unfortunately, however, what could be a positive additional means for prisoners and their families to stay in touch is in danger of becoming any thing but a blessing. Some jurisdictions have already begun to eliminate contact visits entirely in favor of their virtual counterpart \u2013 and private corporations are already lining up to exploit this latest opportunity to fleece prisoners' families.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/cc_Video_Visitation_White_Paper.pdf\">new report (pdf)</a> by the Sentencing Project examined the growth of video calls and what it means for children whose parents are incarcerated. It came to the fairly logical conclusion that as long as virtual visits are supplemental to the real thing, are not cost-prohibitive and that the calls can be frequent and made from home or from a nearby site, then they can be a very good thing. Considering that video technology is readily available to anyone who has a computer, that it's cheap (or often free to use), there's no good reason why video calls to prison should not be an affordable and easy alternative. Many prison jurisdictions are, however, negating the best aspects of the \"video visit\", either by charging exorbitant fees or by requiring the families to make the trek to the prison, or a site near the prison, to make the call.</p> <p>For instance, <a href=\"http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx/agency/doc/section/4/release/23567\">this past July</a>, the District of Columbia eliminated the possibility of regular, old-fashioned face-to-face visits with prisoners and switched to video visitation <em>only</em>. They do not charge the families for the actual video call, but the calls can only be made by appointment from a facility a few hundred yards from the prison. So family members still have to absorb the inconvenience and cost of traveling to the prison, but without the payoff of getting a real, live visit once they get there.</p> <p>The DC department of corrections <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVNHRxPotSI\">has been touting the wonderful benefits</a> of this new system; it is to save them hundreds of thousands of dollars and avoids all the inconvenience of having to escort prisoners from their cells to the visiting area. Needless to say, the prisoners, who now get more cell time and no face time with their families, are less enthusiastic.</p> <p>For now, at least, the families are not charged for the \"convenience\" of these video visits, but advocates worry that this may soon change. The teleconferencing technology was installed for no cost by Global Tel Link, a private corporation that is in the business of making money. As it turns out, Global Tel Link already has an exclusive contract with the DC department of corrections for all their inmate telephone calls. At present, like all phone companies who are doing business with prisons, they get to charge their captive audience exorbitant rates that would not be tolerated, or legal, in the free world.</p> <p>A long-overdue <a href=\"http://www.corrections.com/news/article/31674-fcc-looks-likely-to-cap-phone-rates-for-prisoners\">ruling is expected shortly from the Federal Communications Commission</a> and that is expected to impose a limit on prison phone rates. We'll see how long video calls remain free, then, once this major source of revenue for the telecoms companies dries up.</p> <p>Some jurisdictions are already charging exorbitant fees for video visits and even boasting about their potential as a great new revenue stream. The sheriff of Ada County, Idaho has claimed that virtual visits will generate more than $2m over two years \u2013 presumably, out of the pockets of inmate's families. In Virginia, the department of corrections touts the expansion of the <a href=\"http://www.vadoc.state.va.us/offenders/prison-life/videoVisitation.shtm\">Video Visitation Program</a> on their website as a means for families \"to meet with their imprisoned family or friends without having to invest the time and money in traveling long distances to correctional facilities\". The families can, instead, \"meet\" their loved ones for the bargain price of $15 for a 30-minute video session, or $30 for 60 minutes.</p> <p>The Virginia DOC also claims that the \"minimal fee\" does not benefit it, but goes towards defraying costs. The fact is, however, that if those families were calling a loved one that was not incarcerated, using software like Skype or some other VoIP service, the call would cost them nothing.</p> <p>When the profit motive is removed from the equation, video visits as a supplement to regular visits can be a great thing. In New York, for instance, the Osborne Association has <a href=\"http://www.osborneny.org/programs.cfm?programID=15\">an excellent program</a> in place that allows children to televisit their mothers in the Albion Correctional Facility, which is the largest women's prison in New York state and the furthest away from the city. The kids get to spend 45 minutes in a child-friendly environment talking, playing, doing their homework with or being read to by their incarcerated mothers, with whom they otherwise would rarely get to interact. The program uses the most basic video-calling software and there is no charge to the families.</p> <p>Sadly, this set-up is the exception rather than the norm \u2013 and that's a pity because strong family bonds are key to reducing recidivism. Since prisons are supposed to be about rehabilitation and promoting public safety, it's disturbing to see that another means of achieving these goals is in danger of becoming just another way to punish prisoners \u2013 and make a quick buck off their often hard-pressed families.</p>",
  "<p>Costa Coffee has abandoned plans to open a new outlet in the Devon town of Totnes after months of protests by a campaign group.</p> <p>The chain's plans had been approved by the local district council, and the 70-seat outlet had been expected to open this year, but Costa now claims to have \"recognised the strength of feeling\" about its arrival and has decided to pull out.</p> <p>In August Costa <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/totnes-war-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> that it aimed \"to add to the vibrancy of the town and support the local community \u2026 by adding vibrancy [and] complementing what Totnes currently offers\".</p> <p>Later that month the chain's managing director, Chris Rogers, met Totnes's mayor, Pruw Boswell, and the town's Conservative MP, Sarah Wollaston, both of whom were opposed to Costa's arrival and supportive of the local \"Say no to Costa\" campaign. Costa now says the discussion resulted in its about-turn.</p> <p>\"We had an open and constructive discussion and as a result \u2026 we have carefully considered the points made and decided not to open on Totnes high street,\" said a company statement.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.drsarah.org.uk/downloads/press-releases\" title=\"\">letter</a> signed by all three parties acknowledges Costa's 19 outlets in Devon and their use of milk and food from the county. But it describes Totnes as \"a town with a long and proud history of independent retailers\", which has \"one of the lowest percentages of branded stores of any town of its size in the UK, very few empty shop fronts, as well as a very high proportion of places selling coffee\".</p> <p>Campaigners put the number of coffee-selling businesses in the town \u2013 population 7,500 \u2013 at 42. Totnes is the home of the UK's original <a href=\"http://www.transitiontowntotnes.org/\" title=\"\">transition town</a> project, which is aimed at \"strengthening the local economy, reducing the cost of living and preparing for a future with less oil and a changing climate\", partly via a local currency. The anti-Costa campaign drew much of its energy and nous from the work of Transition Town Totnes.</p> <p>A petition expressing opposition to the chain's arrival collected 5,749 signatures, 75% of which were said to have come from the town or its surrounding areas. Campaigners threatened to greet Costa's opening with a campaign of resistance: among the ideas proposed were encouraging locals to order tap water and drink it as slowly as possible, covering the Costa outlet's exterior in hostile posters, and encouraging a local boycott.</p> <p>The anti-Costa campaigner and Transition Town Totnes action manager Frances Northrop said Costa's decision \"said something about a company actually coming to visit a place and understanding it, rather than sticking a pin in a map\".</p> <p>She added: \"This is a massive achievement, and it could be a turning point in terms of chains getting too big. The idea of communities standing up and saying 'you're not right for us' has now got a lot more traction than it would have had before.\"</p> <p>Costa's statement about Totnes says it is \"proud to be a successful British company employing 10,000 people, the majority of whom are under 25\". It says that \"in all communities in which we operate, we seek to be a force for good, contributing to growth, creating jobs, and supporting the local economy\".</p> <p>The company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Whitbread plc, is now the UK's biggest coffee chain, operating 1,400 outlets. It recently announced plans for 350 more, and its chief executive, Andy Harrison, has talked of increasing the number of branches to as many as 2,000. But the chain's founder, Bruno Costa, who sold the business to Whitbread in 1995, has recently drawn attention to the chain's domination of the coffee shop market.</p> <p>Costa now lives in Purley, Croydon, where Costa has just opened its sixth outlet. \"As far as the coffee business is concerned, like here in Purley, I know it is monopolised by these three or four companies that don't give much chance to the smaller ones,\" he <a href=\"http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/Costa-Coffee-founder-hometown-Purley-coffee-shops/story-17072582-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">told the Croydon Advertiser</a>. \"It reflects what the supermarkets have done to smaller shops in the high streets.\"</p>",

Saul accuses him of working for Hizbullah, the Lebanese Shia movement-cum-militia with close links to Iran, which has been accused of targeting Lebanese opponents and supporting Bashar al-Assad \u2013 as well as fighting Israel.</p> <p>So far, so plausible. OK, there is the odd far-fetched twist in the plot and some extraordinary security breaches. But there are also a few clunking errors, not least because the Lebanese scenes were filmed in Israel \u2013 a safer and more congenial environment in which to show a CIA sniper team targeting terrorists in an Arab capital. Unbelievably, a scene showing Carrie being pursued down a Beirut alleyway featured ads and posters in Hebrew. Other glimpses of Israel include cars with blurred yellow Israeli license plates, a famous clock tower in Jaffa and a rooftop scene showing the Tel Aviv skyline.</p> <p>Maybe these are technical glitches that only cognoscenti would spot. But this is a touchy area. It annoyed the Lebanese government enough to ponder legal action over the portrayal of Hamra street in west Beirut as the kind of place where Abu Nazir would meet a Hizbullah bigwig. Hamra is full of cafes, bookshops and bars, and far from the Shia southern suburbs where Hizbullahis hang out. It wasn't a great ad for the Lebanese tourist board. Then again, last week, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2012/oct/20/beirut-bomb-blast-in-pictures\">a car bomb was set off</a> in the nearby area of Ashrafieh, killing eight people, including the Lebanese intelligence chief Wissam al-Hassan, and injuring 78 more.</p> <p>And then there's a more substantial puzzler: why would an al-Qaida (Sunni) jihadi type be cooperating with (Shia, Iranian-backed) Hizbullah anyway? Occasional rumours and propaganda apart, there's never been any hint that Tehran has backed al-Qaida, though it did shelter some Bin Laden relatives for a while.</p> <p>It's no secret that Homeland was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/jul/12/prisoners-of-war-hatufim-boxset\" title=\"\">a popular Israeli TV series called Hatufim</a> (The Abducted, or Prisoners of War as it was translated for broadcast), which tells the story of soldiers readjusting to ordinary life after prolonged captivity. The best known true-life example was Gilad Shalit, the young corporal captured on the Israeli side of the border with the Gaza Strip and held for five years until he was swapped for 1,027 Palestnian prisoners. No real-life Israeli has developed sympathy for his captors the way the fictional US marine did.</p> <p>Homeland purports to portray a nuanced version of the \"war on terror\" but the story is still told through a national security prism and (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/13/homeland-drama-offensive-portrayal-islam-arabs\" title=\"\">as Peter Beaumont pointed out recently in the Observer</a>) with more than a touch of Islamophobia \u2014 from Brody's badly pronounced \"Allahu Akbar\" while praying secretly in his garage, to the portrayal of all the Muslim characters as devious and cruel.</p> <p>Strikingly, the cast has not (yet) included any Palestinians \u2013 important players in the contemporary Middle East. Like it or not their grievances are highly relevant to Arab/Muslim hostility to Israel and its US protectors. You don't have to be Abu Nazir to observe that neither are simply the passive victims of evil and motiveless terrorists. But why spoil a rattling good story with too many confusing details from the messier and even longer-running series that is the real world?</p>",
  "<p>Apple's launch of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/23/ipad-mini-apple-tablet-google-amazon\" title=\"\">smaller, cheaper iPad</a> this week generated a global hullabaloo, but for one Chinese businessman in Brazil, it cannot have seemed quite so extraordinary.</p> <p>Paulo Xu had been there and done that \u2013 a year earlier and for half the price \u2013 with a 300-reais (\u00a3100) tablet computer that has brought the internet into hundreds of thousands of low-income homes for the first time.</p> <p>The technology may have been less advanced, but the simple device showed how new combinations of manufacturing nous and marketing opportunities are changing the face of the electronics industry in emerging economies.</p> <p>With the European market in crisis and production costs rising in China, Latin America is an increasingly attractive proposition for many major firms seeking new areas of growth. In recent weeks, BMW, Foxconn and Hyundai have announced major new investments in Brazil.</p> <p>Xu arrived many years earlier and has since built one of Brazil's fastest growing computer companies.</p> <p>Born Xu Wei to a middle-class family in Nantong, Jiangsu province, he came to Brazil in 1994, adopted the name Paulo, and started out in the kitchen of a Japanese restaurant, where he says he worked 17 hours a day and earned 450 reais a month.</p> <p>But like his idol, Li Ka Shing \u2013 Asia's richest man \u2013 he had ambitions to become an entrepreneur. Xu opened a restaurant, then a gift shop, then moved into consumer electronics by forming a new company, Digital Life, in 2004.</p> <p>He started out with car audio equipment and moved into the tablet business a few years ago, getting technical advice from manufacturers in China. Many components are made in his homeland, but all the assembly work is done in Brazil, which enables him to qualify for generous tax breaks.</p> <p>To avoid competition with higher-end devices made by multinational brands, Digital Life aims at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/avenida-brasil-clash-president-cancel-rally\" title=\"\">growing niche of low-income consumers</a>.</p> <p>Thanks to strong economic growth, government wealth redistribution polices and \u2013 sometimes alarmingly \u2013 extended credit lines, this group are starting to buy smartphones, motorbikes and other products that were unavailable to them before.</p> <p>Digital Life's cheapest tablet computer, which retails for 300 reais (\u00a393), has an 800 MHz processor, four gigabytes of memory, an 18cm (7in) screen and a wireless modem. Unusually for a tablet, it also has a port for a cable connection because many purchasers do not want to pay extra for routers.</p> <p>Despite a slowdown of the Brazilian economy in 2012 to about 2%, Xu expects sales of his low-price tablet to increase tenfold this year to 1m units, and to rise to 2.5m by 2014.</p> <p>\"When it comes to the Chinese and Brazilian markets, my advice is to bet on the economy and work honestly. That always gives a return,\" he says.</p> <p>His business owes much to the model that made China the workshop of the world: importing hi-tech components from overseas and assembling them cheaply.</p> <p>In his case, this is being done on a medium scale at a factory in Minas Gerais. But multinationals are starting to follow suit.</p> <p>With costs rising in China and the Latin American market growing, several big manufacturers are expanding their operations in Brazil.</p> <p>Taiwan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/foxconn\" title=\"\">Foxconn</a>, which assembles products for Apple and others, is moving more of its operations from China. Since opening its first factory in Brazil last year, it has ramped up production. Last month, it announced a 1bn reais plan to build its seventh plant in Brazil. The megafacility in S\u00e3o Paulo will assemble smartphones and tablet computers and provide 10,000 jobs.</p> <p>China's Chery Automobile recently unveiled a $400m investment in a new factory in S\u00e3o Paulo that will have the capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles per year once it is finished towards the end of 2013.</p> <p>This week, BMW announced plans to build its first car plant in Latin America. Construction will begin next April on the $264 factory in Araquari. South Korea's Hyundai and Samsung are also working on new factories in Brazil.</p> <p>Brazil is in dire need of more manufacturing to rebalance an economy that is over-reliant on exports of commodities such as soy, iron ore and oil. China is its main customer for raw materials and greatest competitor for manufactured goods. For most of the past decade, cheap Chinese goods have dominated.</p> <p>This has been a similar story in much of Latin America, but there are signs that this may be changing as the costs of doing business in China start to rise because of improved labour regulations and a stronger currency. According to a recent study by JP Morgan, labour costs in Mexico and China are now almost equal \u2013 a dramatic change since 2003, when the latter was three times cheaper.</p> <p>But Brazil still has to catch up. Compared with China, Xu says, Brazil has more bureaucracy, less developed supply chains and weaker industrial promotion policies.</p> <p>Nonetheless, with the Chinese market more saturated and competitive, he sees the greatest future opportunities in Brazil.</p> <p>\"The Brazilian market is very big and diverse because Brazilians like new things, especially technology. Chinese consumers are more conservative,\" he says. \"All the expansions that we are planning will be made right here in Brazil.\"</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Carolina Massote</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2012 to correct Paulo Xu's given name.</p>",

I don't know what you do about that. It's easier to deny.\"</p> <p>Asked what was needed to wake people up, the veteran broadcaster famous for series such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_Collection\" title=\"\">Life</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mywy\" title=\"\">Planet Earth</a> said: \"Disaster. It's a terrible thing to say, isn't it? Even disaster doesn't do it. There have been disasters in North America, with hurricanes and floods, yet still people deny and say 'oh, it has nothing to do with climate change.' It visibly has got [something] to do with climate change.\"</p> <p>But some US politicians found it easier to deny the science on climate change than take action, he said, because the consequence of recognising the science on man-made climate change \"means a huge section from the national budget will be spent in order to deal with it, plenty of politicians will be happy to say 'don't worry about that, we're not going to increase your taxes.'\"</p> <p>Neither Barack Obama or Mitt Romney mentioned climate change in three TV debates, despite a summer of record temperatures and historic drought in the US.</p> <p>Romney used Obama's commitment to taking action on climate change <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney-acceptance-speech-hope\" title=\"\">as a joke in his convention speech</a>. The president later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">hit back by saying</a> \"and yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke.\" However, environmentalists have been critical of Obama's silence on the subject and the Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/22/us-elections-barack-obama-climate-denial\" title=\"\">went as far as saying</a> it meant he was, in effect, \"another climate denier\".</p> <p>Attenborough said he thought the US's attitude towards climate change and the environment was not just because of politics, but because of the country's history. \"[It's] because they're a pioneer country. There has been the wild west, the western frontier\u2026 that's still there, you see it in the arms business, the right for everyone to bear arms. It's part of the pioneer stuff that you've [Americans] grown up with.\"</p> <p>By contrast, he said, people in the UK had \"grown up with a mythology of black industry and wrecking the countryside.\"</p> <p>The current financial crisis has made it problematic for politicians to show leadership on climate change, Attenborough acknowledged. \"Well it's a very difficult time to do it [show leadership]. In times of recession, it's a very difficult time to advance these arguments [on the urgency of tackling climate change] that mean you have to spend even more money and take money from taxes to do things,\" he said.</p> <p>Yet he also warned that it was becoming clear the impacts of climate change were worst than had been expected. Talking about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">record Arctic sea ice melt this summer</a>, he said: \"The situation is worse than we thought [in the Arctic]. The processes of melting are more volatile than we thought. More complicated. The ice cap is really melting faster than we thought.\"</p> <p>The 86-year-old naturalist, who is also a patron of the charity <a href=\"http://www.populationmatters.org/\" title=\"\">Population Matters</a>, said many of the environmental problems the world faced could be helped by addressing human population, which is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/31/seven-billionth-baby-born-philippines\" title=\"\">believed to have reached the 7 billion mark last year</a>, and is forecast to reach 10 billion by the middle of the century.</p> <p>The solution, he said, was to raise living standards and increase democracy in developing countries. \"The only way I can think of it [tackling population] is by giving women the rights to control their own bodies and control how many children they have. In every circumstance where women have that right, where they have the vote, where they are proper medical facilities, where they are literate, where they are given the choice, the birth rate falls,\" he said. \"That is a good start, if that could be spread.\"</p> <p>\u2022 You can read more of Sir David Attenborough's views on climate change and animals in this Sunday's Observer magazine</p>",

  "<p>I recently spent a week at the bi-annual conference of parties to the <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/\" title=\"\">UN Convention on Biological Diversity</a> (CBD COP 11) in Hyderabad, India, where more than 170 of the 193 signatories to the convention worked away feverishly until the early hours negotiating the heavy outcome document.</p> <p>These discussions led to a doubling of developed country commitments to biodiversity, from $6bn (\u00a33.8bn) to $12bn (\u00a37.5bn) by 2015. But as I left Hyderabad, I wondered if I should be pleased or disappointed.</p> <p>My recent work as chair of the High Level Panel, whose task was to estimate the amount of finance needed to meet the 20 Aichi targets agreed upon in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010, was among the inputs into the process now happening in India. However, our estimates of what was truly needed to achieve the targets were of a higher order of magnitude \u2013 higher than both the existing baselines and the commitments made. Will this $6bn increase make a difference when financing needs are really in the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars?</p> <p>Biodiversity is the living fabric of this planet; its ecosystems, species and genes. Conserving biodiversity includes reducing forest losses and restoring forest cover to increase soil fertility (Aichi Targets #5 and #14), prevent droughts, mitigate flood damage, stop the spread of desertification and provide better livelihoods for the world's 1.3bn small farmers.</p> <p>Increasing marine protected areas (part of Aichi Target #11)&#xa0;and increasing the stocks of fish in the sea, which provide the main source of animal protein for more than 1 billion people in the developing world, are just as important, as is controlling pollution (Aichi Target #8), which will not just reduce biodiversity loss but will improve human health, fresh water, agriculture, fisheries \u2026 the list goes on.</p> <p>These Aichi targets are a large part of sustainable development for the world \u2013 no wonder that their financing is not small change.</p> <p>The results of COP 11 discussions were not disappointing in themselves, but it was sad that the wider goals of sustainable development for which they are essential did not receive more urgent and widespread attention. Meanwhile, the need for transitioning to a \"green economy\" to deliver these goals grows more palpable and urgent every year.</p> <p>The silos in which we all operate are part of the problem. Desertification and climate change fall under separate UN conventions, even though they are inextricably linked to the maintenance and restoration of ecosystems; the large-scale layer of biodiversity.</p> <p>It can be difficult to see anything in perspective if one is immersed in it. Lucky for me, I had to fly from Hyderabad to Bhutan just after COP 11 to attend a conference of tiger range countries, organised by <a href=\"http://www.globaltigerinitiative.org/\" title=\"\">the World Bank's global tiger initiative</a>.</p> <p>I drove along the Paro river through&#xa0;mountain-flanked valleys from the airport to Thimphu, Bhutan's capital, and was greeted by legions of fluttering prayer flags dancing out their hymns to the drumbeat of a bracing mountain wind. Far below, the crystal waters of the Paro sparkled in rhythmic company, flashing clear Himalayan sunlight. Carpets of red chilies, carefully laid to dry on the low sloping tin roofs of Bhutanese homes, soaked in this bright hot sun.</p> <p>In Bhutan, biodiversity is everywhere around you, abundant and healthy. People love it and respect it. This is the kind of world that all those Aichi targets seek to achieve, and it lives here for all to see.</p> <p>Bhutan doesn't have billions of dollars to finance this biodiversity conservation. Instead, it is ingrained in the culture and history of the land. The country's constitution commits 60% of Bhutan to forest cover. At the conference, <a href=\"http://www.moaf.gov.bt/moaf/?page_id=10\" title=\"\">Lyonpo Dr Pema Gyamtsho</a>, Bhutan's agriculture and forests minister, said: \"There can be no justice unless other living beings have equal rights of existence on this planet.\"</p> <p>We often hear of rights-based approaches to biodiversity conservation, but in Bhutan this is not just dreamy talk \u2013 it is visible reality.</p> <p><em>Pavan Sukhdev is an environmental economist and board member for </em><a href=\"http://www.conservation.org/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Conservation International</em></a><em>.

  "<p>MPs and environmental campaigners on Thursday condemned the appointment of climate sceptic Peter Lilley to the committee that scrutinises the government's energy and climate policies, calling the move \"deeply worrying\".</p> <p>The Tory MP, one of only three MPs to vote against the Climate Change Act in 2008, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/25/climate-change-sceptic-peter-lilley-commons-committee?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">has been appointed</a> to the energy and climate change select committee. It follows a recent cabinet reshuffle that included John Hayes, a vocal critic of wind power in the past, being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/john-hayes-charles-hendry-energy-minister\" title=\"\">installed as the new energy minister</a>, and Owen Paterson, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/11/owen-paterson-environment-guardian-profile\" title=\"\">an advocate of shale gas who has also spoken out against windfarms</a>, as environment secretary.</p> <p>Lilley is the vice-chairman and senior independent non-executive director of Tethys Petroleum Ltd, an oil and gas company with operations in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Tethys most recently paid him \u00a347,000 for 120 hours' work over the period of a year \"attending meetings and advising on business developments\", <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/121001/lilley_peter.htm\" title=\"\">the register of members' financial interests shows</a>.</p> <p>Lilley told the Guardian: \"My focus will be that of the committee. My approach will be to examine evidence on any issue we examine critically and objectively before reaching a conclusion.\"</p> <p>The MP has been an outspoken critic of green energy and action on climate change, embarking on a long-running campaign against what he claims are the onerous economic costs of implementing Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to cutting carbon emissions in 2050 by 80% on 1990 levels.</p> <p>He has previously said the \"science is not resolved\" on climate change, <a href=\"http://www.peterlilley.co.uk/news/speech-given-policy-exchange-event\" title=\"\">\"a degree or two rise in temperature is, of itself, not a huge concern\",</a> and recently criticised the Stern review <a href=\"http://www.thegwpf.org/peter-lilley-costly-decarbonisation-of-the-economy-is-based-on-flawed-stern-review/\" title=\"\">in a report for the Global Warming Policy Foundation</a>, the Nigel Lawson-founded thinktank sceptical of climate change.</p> <p>\"I am highly critical of Lord Stern's 'economics' on which this and the previous government's policies are based,\" he told the Guardian. Lilley was a cabinet minister under the Thatcher and Major governments.</p> <p>Alan Whitehead, Labour MP and a member of the 11-strong climate committee, said: \"It is odd that someone who doesn't believe in the existence of half of the committee's brief would want to be a member of that select committee. But since a select committee's central role is to hear, digest and publish evidence on these matters, I'm sure his membership will be a tremendous educational opportunity.\"</p> <p>Greenpeace policy director, Joss Garman, said: \"The addition of climate change sceptic and oil company director Peter Lilley to the energy and climate change select committee is part of a growing picture. With Owen Paterson as environment secretary and anti-wind campaigner John Hayes now energy minister, you'd be forgiven for thinking the Tories are gearing up to assault the Climate Change Act and increase the UK's reliance on expensive, imported, polluting fossil fuels.\"</p> <p>Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said: \"This is a deeply worrying development \u2013 Peter Lilley was one of the few MPs to vote against the Climate Change Act. With a growing question mark over the government's commitment to a science-based approach to safeguarding the environment, this committee has a crucial role to play in holding ministers to account over their legally binding climate targets. One of Lilley's first tasks should be to meet with the foremost experts on climate change to familiarise himself with the latest science \u2013 Friends of the Earth would be more than happy to facilitate this.\"</p> <p>Caroline Lucas, the Green party's MP and former leader, said: \"That Conservative MPs have voted Lilley, a senior oil industry figure and well-known climate sceptic, to serve on the parliamentary committee tasked with scrutinising the UK's climate and energy policy is a clear sign that anti-green, anti-science forces are gaining ground.</p> <p>\"Lilley's position as a oil executive means that he is likely to be far more concerned with the short-term profits of the dinosaur polluting fossil fuel barons than tackling the huge threat posed by climate change \u2013 or recognising the opportunities of switching to a green economy.\"</p> <p>Lilley is likely to replace fellow Tory MP Laura Sandys, who has been an outspoken supporter of renewable energy and the green economy, and who was <a href=\"http://telllaura.org.uk/news/laura-sandys-mp-new-pps-to-minister-of-state-greg-barker-mp\" title=\"\">recently appointed parliamentary private secretary to climate minister Greg Barker</a>.</p>",

History does not yet know quite how highly Williams' contemporaries rate his own handiwork \u2013 the USACA board is due to hold a hearing examining his behaviour on 10 November \u2013 but we can only note that in the cases of both British generals and cricket administrators, the competition for the title awarded to Elphinstone is especially fierce.</p> <p>This fiasco \u2013 the latest in a <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/282227.html\" title=\"Cricinfo story\">long</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/511883.html\" title=\"Further Cricinfo reading\">long</a> line in the USACA's recent history \u2013 began on 13 October, when Williams took objection to an <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/usa/content/story/586519.html\" title=\"Cricinfo article by Penna\">article written on Cricinfo by Peter Della Penna</a>. I've never met Della Penna and can tell you nothing about any loyalties or alliances he may or may not have among the game's officials in the US. But I do know that I like his work, and that he has worked, tirelessly and determinedly, to shed a little light on the decidedly murky world of cricket administration in that country.</p> <p>Williams snapped. A message was posted on the USACA's official Facebook page: \"Peter Della Penna continues his unethical journalistic bias by writing yet another scathing article on USA cricket's internal affairs.\" Ouch. Williams was soon challenged to back up his claim. And he started swinging his punches so wildly that he ended up clobbering himself in the chops. Repeatedly. Firstly, he threatened to sue Della Penna:</p> <p>\"If you were any 'journalist', you would realise that your blogs are overly obsessive and therefore not covered by any protection under the law as none of you are professional journalist [sic]. And yes Peter, you will be sued.\"</p> <p>\"What other sport in the USA,\" Williams complained, \"has three people constantly baddgering [sic] its administrators? There is a clear agenda to defame the organisation.\"</p> <p>Williams then turned on Martin Williamson, who is not only an excellent cricket journalist but also managing editor of ESPN Digital Media in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It's worth bearing in mind at this point that ESPN, an American company, owns Cricinfo, which is the most read cricket website in the world, and has almost a million readers in the USA alone. That bang you just heard? That'd be the sound of a man shooting himself in the buttock.</p> <p>\"In the USA, journalists need to be QUALIFIED and belong to an organisation that endorses their profession,\" Williams raved. \"There are ethical standards that needs [sic] to be met. Bloggers \u2013 like yourself and Peter get around this professional endorsement by only using the internet to spew venom. Ask yourself if your garbage could ever be considered for publication in the magazine. Reason: you and Peter and other bloggers are unqualified as professional journalists.</p> <p>\"America has standards Martin \u2013 you don't just wake up one day and decide that you are a journalists [sic]. Especially if your career before your obsession with USACA was selling knives for a living. Sorry \u2013 send Peter to journalism school to learn the basics. Then send him to the New York Press Club to become a member and then to the NYPD to get a press pass. I need to see credentials and so will a judge.\"</p> <p>Exactly why Williams wanted to send Della Penna to the New York Police Department isn't clear. But he was only just warming up. He became oddly fixated on the previous careers of both Della Penna and Williamson. \"For an organisation not to adress [sic] the inaccuracies and defamatory statements by a bizzarre [sic] ex-knife salesman is bizzarre [sic]. Welcome to the age of social media. EVERY organisation does it,\" he shot at Della Penna, before pausing to reload and take aim at Williamson: \"MW on your resume \u2026 I actually doubt that you worked for Barclays after HS there is no record of it. My basic point \u2026 any bloke can tout himself to be a journalist. As you well know you are hiding behind the internet.\"</p> <p>\"Again,\" Williams added. \"These people are not 'journalist' [sic] by any variation on the definition of the profession. I beg Peter and Martin to prove to me they are qualified as journalists. They are internet bloggers and have NO journalistic privilege. NONE!!! ESPN will have to make a decision on these two if they want to do business with USA cricket.\"</p> <p>On and on it goes. For the sake of space, I'll suggest that you if you'd like to read more you go and have a look <a href=\"http://cricket.about.com/od/domestic/a/The-Usaca-Social-Media-Debacle.htm\" title=\"Social media debacle\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sportskeeda.com/2012/10/18/knives-out-in-usas-facebook-fight-club/\" title=\"Facebook fight club\">here</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.rantsports.com/clubhouse/2012/10/16/the-usaca-shows-the-world-how-not-to-use-social-media/\" title=\"How not to use social media\">here</a>. By now, news of Williams meltdown had spread, and he had gone on to swap shots with Iain O'Brien, the former Kiwi fast bowler, who was told by Williams, somewhat cryptically, that \"I am a marketing and brand expert as you can well see. It looks bad but its intended.\"</p> <p>A little like a man who has spent so long shovelling that he hasn't realised how deep a pit he has dug for himself, Williams suddenly stopped, looked up, and realised he needed a way out.</p> <p>He offered a free iPad to whoever left the 1,000th comment on the thread and then explained that \"Everything I do is a calculated risk. I needed to silence Peter's informant and that has been accomplished. I also needed to let the world know that ESPN is sponsoring two of the worst bloggers on the planet. We need bettr [sic] writers if USA Cricket is going to progress. Their obsession with USA Cricket is uncanning [sic] \u2013 especially for Martin who does not even live here or understand our culture.\"</p> <p>The USACA's \"marketing and brand expert\" certainly moves in mysterious ways, as far beyond our ken as the teapot is to the bear. The thread has since disappeared. As have, one imagines, Mr Williams' chances of promotion.</p>",
  "<p>Tony Abbott, the Australian opposition leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/julia-gillard-poll-misogyny-speech?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">accused of misogyny</a> by the country's prime minister, Julia Gillard, in a recent blistering speech that went viral online, has now accused the Australian government of being one that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/julia-gillard-misogynist-sexism-baby?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">\"lacks experience in raising children\"</a>. Considering Gillard was previously described by the conservative senator, Bill Heffernan, in 2007 as being <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2007/s1912717.htm\" title=\"\">\"deliberately barren\"</a>, it seems fairly likely that Abbott's remark was not directed at \"the government\", but at Gillard herself, particularly as Gillard's cabinet contains members with <a href=\"http://www.skynews.com.au/topstories/article.aspx?id=808680\" title=\"\">\"several children\"</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps one of the reasons the continuing spats between Abbott and Gillard are getting so much attention is that Abbott says out loud what many think about childless women: that our inexperience as mothers means that we're not really qualified to have an opinion on <em>anything</em>. \"You'd understand if you had children\" is the unspoken thought.</p> <p>But why is this? When did being a mature adult woman equal being a mother? When did woman and mother become interchangeable terms?</p> <p>The gift of humanity, and what makes it possible for us to live in society with people other than our blood relatives, is empathy. Empathy means literally \"feeling into\" \u2013 it's our ability to emotionally put ourselves into other people's shoes. Empathy is what makes civilisation possible and a person without empathy is considered to be a psychopath.</p> <p>It is not necessary to be disabled in order to empathise with the challenges faced by disabled people and, similarly, disabled people are similarly capable of empathising with challenges faced by non-disabled people. Or not. Each individual's empathic capacity varies, like all human attributes, and develops differently depending on their environment and experiences throughout life. Therefore, while some people are capable of feeling into another's world with ease, others may have no more than a basic working capacity, as it would appear Abbott does from recent exchanges. But then again, he may be playing the misogynist as a political manoeuvre.</p> <p>So just where does the idea that childless women are incapable of understanding the challenges of parenting come from? After all, we too were children once, and many of us have children in our lives, and even work with them.</p> <p>Our culture has always feared the childless woman; she's a destabilising and potentially radical figure. Once upon a time, there weren't that many of us, and so we could be vilified as witches (while consulted as healers). But among the generation of women currently aged between 40-50 (what I think of as the shock absorber generation for the sexual revolution) one in five are reaching the menopause without having had children. This is double what it was a generation ago \u2013 and while some have freely chosen this and call themselves \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/11/parents-and-parenting-children\" title=\"\">childfree</a>\" there are many women, myself included, who are childless by circumstance.</p> <p>As there have never been so many women in our culture not involved directly in child-rearing, we are looking at a challenge of how we define what it means to be a woman if you're not a mother. It's no longer acceptable to vilify one in five women \u2013 it just won't wash, as Abbott is finding.</p> <p>Gillard <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/pm-v-obama-who-has-it-harder-20120401-1w6qa.html\" title=\"\">tells of a joke</a> she shared with Barack Obama: \"I tell him, 'You think it's tough being African-American? Try being me. Try being an atheist, childless, single woman as prime minister'.\" Ultimately, whether Gillard is a good prime minister does not depend on her childlessness, it depends on her leadership.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Margaret Atwood: </strong>It may seem strange that I'm co-writing a serial zombie novel with Naomi Alderman, being posted chapter by chapter on the global story-sharing site, <a href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/\" title=\"\">Wattpad</a>. Why Wattpad? Why Naomi? Why zombies?</p> <p>First, there's a lot of angst from publishers and writers about the young \"not reading\", which may mean they aren't reading what older people want them to read. My college teacher, <a href=\"http://northropfrye-theanatomyofcriticism.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Northrop Frye</a>, said you should let the young begin with whatever interests them; and millions of them are interested in Wattpad. Why Naomi? She's an accomplished novelist and also my <a href=\"http://www.rolexmentorprotege.com/mentors__proteges/literature\" title=\"\">Rolex Mentee</a>, and we're exploring many facets of writing and publishing together. </p> <p>But in her other life \u2013 and, as a self-supporting writer for 40 years, I understand the necessity of second lives \u2013 she's a videogame author, most recently of <a href=\"https://www.zombiesrungame.com/\" title=\"\">Zombies Run!</a>, which has seen her and her co-creators funded to develop the prototype for a similar exercise aid by the NHS. So it's a good fit; and the meaning of the zombie obsession intrigues us both. <a href=\"http://www.granta.com/New-Writing/The-Meaning-of-Zombies\" title=\"\">Naomi has written about it in Granta</a>, I recently made a speech about it <a href=\"http://lectures.princeton.edu/2012/margaret-atwood/\" title=\"\">at Princeton University</a>. Don't dismiss the zombies: they have Deeper Meaning. They just don't know it.</p> <p><strong>Naomi Alderman:</strong> The zombies definitely have a deeper meaning \u2013 anything that intrigues and fascinates people has something to tell us about ourselves. So why do I feel defensive about being interested in zombies as well as the evils of fundamentalist religion? About researching mythical monsters as well as the history of the Congo? The hiving off of \"fantasy\" in bookshops is, and always has been, a nonsense. After all, who wrote about witches, monsters and spells? Homer. Who wrote about fairies, wizards and ghosts? Shakespeare. Zombies can be as serious as any Caliban or Poseidon.</p> <p>But our zombies aren't really serious. That's the pleasure of them. Part of the delight of working on this with Margaret, whose work has influenced and inspired me all my writing life, has been to see that, yes, even serious writers don't have to be serious all the time. From the first lines Margaret wrote, this has been a black comedy.</p> <p>We're still writing the end of the story. I'm holding on to my last chapter because I don't want this to end; it's been an exhilarating, hilarious, joyful process. Waiting to get Margaret's chapter, reading it gleefully, trying to come up with something that might take the story in an unexpected direction or give her a problem to solve. Then waiting again to see what she's come up with for me. Remembering that writing is storytelling, and storytelling, after all, is play.</p>",

How are you today?</h2> <p>I'm <strong>good</strong>, Alan. In fact, I'm <strong>grand</strong> - two words there you'll find in clues to indicate a G in the answer. That's \"grand\" as in \"it'll cost you ten Gs\".</p> <h2>Another common one is 'government'...</h2> <p>Yeah, <strong>government</strong> like the G-Men: the Feds in cool 50s movies. But I also play hard - in the Nato alphabet, I'm <strong>golf</strong>. Do you play, Alan? Fancy a round?</p> <h2>No - I, er... have misgivings about monoculture. But that's not important. You sound on top of the world.</h2> <p>I <em>am</em> the world, Alan. Global. G7, G8, G20... when you see G, you know something big is going down. </p> <h2>You seem to have even more grandeur and, well, braggadocio than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/crosswords/crossword-blog/2012/feb/16/crossword-blog-letter-c\">C</a>.</h2> <p>Why are you talking about C? G is nothing like C. We don't even look alike. G; C. C; G. See?</p> <h2>I guess. Now, despite all those '-ing' words which setters should think about if an answer ends with a G, you're the 17th most frequent letter...</h2> <p>Sure, but I make a lot of noise, or rather noises. Hard G like in <strong>Gabon</strong>, soft G like in <strong>George</strong>, and then there's the weird foreign words like rouge and beige. The French have never really got their heads around me. In their alphabet, they say \"G\" as \"J\" and \"J\" as \"G\". <em>Je ne sais pas pourquoi</em>. </p> <h2><em>Moi non plus</em>. Let's talk about when a solver has got a G at the beginning of an answer. Probably an L or an R comes next, unless it's a vowel. Then, the solver should be thinking about a J sound if you come before E, I or Y - the same vowels that change the sound of a C.</h2> <p>There you go again, Alan: likening me to C.</p> <h2>But, I mean, you <em>are</em> pretty similar. In words like 'fresco', or 'periscope', C even starts to sound like you.</h2> <p>Hold it right there. What is your obsession with C?</p> <h2>No, G. I think the question is: what's <em>your</em> obsession with C?</h2> <p>All right, C stole my spot. OK? Happy now? Stole my identity, my whole life. I used to be the third letter of the alphabet, you know. </p> <h2>'I' was the third letter of the alphabet?</h2> <p>No, no: I was. I mean, G. Although I used to look like an I: I was a throwing stick or something, but that's not important. The Etruscans realised that they never used a \"<strong>gee</strong>\" noise and put a K sound in my place, which all ended up with ABC instead of ABG like it used to be and ought to be. The gall of those Etruscans! </p> <h2>So you just went missing?</h2> <p>For 500 years, Alan. Can you imagine a world without G? No <strong>gravity</strong> to keep you grounded. The legend goes that a freed Roman slave, one Spurius Carvilius Ruga, founded Rome's first school of grammar and rediscovered me - and put me in seventh place like I'm supposed to say \"thank you Spurius\". And you wonder why I make a big noise now? I have to. It's a matter of survival. What happened in Tuscany could happen again. </p> <h2>I guess you're kinda happy just to be alive.</h2> <p>Yeah, I'll take anything going. In science, I'm <strong>grammes</strong>, <strong>Gauss</strong>, <strong>giga</strong> - even <strong>conductance</strong> and <strong>acceleration</strong>. It's all good. VG, as they say.</p> <h2>One last thing: you must have been happy when they named the G-spot.</h2> <p>Of course - only it's a bit of a reminder of what happened to me in 700BC. Hard to find, people questioning whether you exist at all - or need to. I gotta go, but it's odd to think that the guy - he was a guy, not a <strong>girl</strong> - who claimed to have discovered the G-spot couldn't actually say it. Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg was German and I don't know if you've ever asked a German where they come from: they say something like \"Tchermany\". Tch!</p>",

This is another sign that the economy is healing and we have the right approach,\" the chancellor said.</p> <p>However, the ONS pointed out that GDP growth \u2013 the strongest rate since the third quarter of 2007 \u2013 had been artificially boosted by two short-term factors: the Olympic Games, which fell in July and August, and the bounce-back from June's extra bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee.</p> <p>All of the income from Olympics tickets was counted towards economic output in the third quarter, whenever it was spent, and the ONS believes ticket sales alone may have added 0.2% to GDP. It said it was \"not possible to quantify\" other effects, such as increased employment and a boost to creative industries.</p> <p>In the second quarter of the year, when growth declined by 0.4%, the ONS said output had been depressed by the extra bank holiday cutting the number of working days, and could be up to 0.5% higher in the third quarter as a result.</p> <p>Amid a storm of criticism of the government's deficit-cutting strategy, including a major anti-cuts march last weekend, Osborne used the figures to insist that his approach was helping to build a stronger economy.</p> <p>\"By continuing to take the tough decisions needed to deal with our debts and equip our economy for the global race we're in, this government is laying the foundations for lasting prosperity,\" he said.</p> <p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the return to growth, but said: \"This is no time for complacency and wishful thinking.</p> <p>\"Today's figures show that underlying growth remains weak and that our economy is only just back to the same size as a year ago \u2013 12 months of damaging flatlining which has seen borrowing rise in the first half of this year.</p> <p>\"And with living standards falling, more tax rises on the way, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, it would be very unwise of David Cameron and George Osborne to just sit back, cross their fingers and hope for the best.\"</p> <p>The ONS gave little breakdown of which parts of the economy had expanded most strongly, since Thursday's release is an early estimate, but it believes construction suffered a 2.5% decline in the quarter, while distribution, hotels and restaurants expanded by 1.6%, transport by 0.8%, and business services and finance \u2013 which includes the crisis-hit banking sector \u2013 by 1%.</p> <p>City economists said the 1% expansion was larger than they had expected, but warned that it was unlikely to be repeated in the months ahead.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, of the data provider Markit, said: \"The government will most likely make the most out of this good news, but unfortunately it is unlikely that the UK will see such a strong performance again for some time. In reality, the danger is that this figure fuels a misguided belief that the economy is on the mend, when in fact there is plenty of evidence to suggest that momentum is being lost again.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There is a real risk that a return to contraction might be seen again in the fourth quarter.\" Treasury officials conceded that the strong 1% growth rate was unlikely to be repeated in future quarters.</p> <p>Howard Archer, of the consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"While the third-quarter GDP growth of 1.0% is encouraging and welcome news, the UK is by no means out of the economic woods and further relapses remain a very real possibility. Fiscal austerity, tight credit conditions, muted global economic activity and still serious problems in the eurozone are all likely to hamper growth.\"</p>",

Although the continent has 30% of the world's extractive resources, and produces more than 60 different types of metals, ores and minerals, even countries with relatively strong governance records are failing to distribute this wealth, or invest it adequately in development.</p> <p>A paper published this week by the <a href=\"http://www.ecdpm.org/\" title=\"\">European Centre for Development Policy Management</a> argues that an overreliance on the extractive industries, rent-seeking behaviour (ie obtaining special favours) and corruption among politicians, and a lack of transparency has sustained the \"resource curse\".</p> <p>\"Substantial rents available to resource-rich countries caused a disproportionate reliance on petro-dollars,\" according to Isabelle Ramdoo, author of <a href=\"http://www.ecdpm.org/Web_ECDPM/Web/Content/Download.nsf/0/6A371689F627EFF1C1257AA00049445D/$FILE/DP136_Final%20Layout.pdf\" title=\"\">From Curse to Purse</a> (pdf). \"Countries remain heavily dependent on a few economic sectors and on exports of primary products, making them highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks such as commodity prices, exchange rate fluctuations and external demand. Furthermore \u2026 infrastructure deficits remain a major hurdle to competitiveness and to private-sector development.\"</p> <p>The paper highlights that Nigeria and Angola rely almost entirely on oil and gas for foreign exports and have failed to develop other sectors. Although Nigeria has only 2.9% of the world's oil and gas reserves, it accounts for more than 90% of its export revenue. Angola has 2.6% of the world's oil and gas, but they account for 99% of its export revenue.</p> <p>\"This is not a question of perception. It is a fact that extractive resources drive away the rest of any significant business you could be doing,\" said Ramdoo. \"It really crowds out other sectors.\"</p> <p>Ramdoo said ensuring an appropriate tax system and preventing capital flight \u2013 estimated to have cost Africa $854bn (\u00a3533bn) since 1970 \u2013 could harness resource revenues for development. Savings funds, investments that diversify the economy, and greater transparency by governments \u2013 including the publication of data on revenues and expenditure \u2013 are also recommended.</p> <p>\"The time has come for Africa to profit from the 156% increase in mining companies' profits,\" Carlos Lopes, UN undersecretary general and executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), told the <a href=\"http://new.uneca.org/adfviii/adf_news.aspx\" title=\"\">eighth African Development Forum</a> in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, this week.</p> <p>\"Africa ought to be using the sector and its resource rents to drive socio-economic development. This means investment in infrastructure, research and human capital development, through conditionality for local content. This is what other regions have done; this is what Africa needs to do,\" Lopes told the forum, the focus of which is governing and harnessing natural resources for Africa's development.</p> <p>However, this will not be easy. Attempts to bring more transparency to payments for oil and gas are being challenged.

It has cost \u00a332 million and is one of the last to be built in the BSF programme. Financial closure was reached in the Spring of 2010, literally days before Michael Gove got into power and put a halt to the spending. Many schools lost the new buildings they needed and had been promised, but at Deptford Green we got under the wire just in time. We feel strongly that our good fortune carries an obligation to demonstrate not only the value of the public investment, but also of the trust put in us at the design stage.</p> <p>Deptford Green is a richly diverse, inner-city comprehensive school. We enjoy our status with the local authority and the collective purpose we share with other LA schools. Some would suggest this denies us the autonomy to innovate or that we may even be 'failing a generation', but the fact is we are pioneering, dynamic and fiercely independent. In an ever changing world we constantly review our curriculum offer, as we strive to equip our students with the skills, attributes and achievements they will need in life. We start with a focus on independent learning and transition at KS3, move through academic and vocational pathways at KS4 and the international baccalaureate Diploma in the sixth form.</p> <p>In designing the school we have sought to balance our desire to keep driving up standards in the present, while allowing as much as possible for the changes to teaching and learning that will occur during the next 70 years. We looked at earlier BSF schools and a range of international schools and we have built a school that is not just functional and shiny, but that is fun and flexible and that genuinely embraces the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-413880242\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350918251141/Deptford-Green-class-006.jpg\" alt=\"Deptford Green class\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deptford Green outdoor class Photograph: Deptford Green School</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deptford Green School</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the design stage, we needed to work within the budget, the space allocation and the statutory regulations and still incorporate the groundbreaking features we wanted (such as outdoor classrooms). We found that many of the 'regulations' were not actually statutory and that we had a great deal of autonomy and scope for creativity. In addition we were fortunate to work with architects (WGI) who quickly bought into our vision for the school and worked wonders in making it possible.</p> <p>There are many examples of how this has been achieved, not least the fact that we wanted the building itself to be inspirational \u2013 to have a wow factor, and it does. First-time visitors come in, look around and say \"wow\". Michael Gove would have us believe that good education is just about good teaching. To an extent of course it is, but I am more convinced than ever that the physical and social environment within which teaching and learning takes place is also critical. Our old school leaked when it rained and computers had to be turned off. Classrooms were too small and often too hot or too cold. The building was crumbling, the toilets didn't work properly and the corridors and stairwells were narrow noisy and poorly lit. This was not an environment that leant itself to inspiring a generation. Our new school, however, can do exactly that.</p> <p>The scope we were given in design has enabled us to incorporate many original features in the new building. The 70 offices and staff rooms in the old school has been reduced to just six in the new one. As head teacher my desk is in the school office along with the leaders of learning and the enterprise team of support staff. There is no school canteen - a 'street' runs through the ground floor of the school with six (biometric) serveries, each offering different food. Our library functions as five resource centres across the school, which double as rooms for research, small classes and meetings. Classrooms are the most important areas in a school, as that is where most of the learning takes place. Nearly all the space saved has gone into our classrooms which are 70 square meters, as opposed to BSF 'regulation' 56 sqm. The additional room size gives teachers greater flexibility. A circle encourages interactive learning and communication, small groups encourage team working, and more traditional rows give a focus to the screen, student or teacher at the front. The flexibility is enhanced by wireless technology and access to laptops throughout. Staff and students are taking great pride in their classrooms and the displays going up are superb. In short, we now have a school where every classroom is a spacious, well lit, well ventilated, inspirational centre of learning.</p> <p>Our conference hall, equipped to the standard of a modern cinema, is excellent for assemblies, the student parliament and school productions. But what captures the essence of the school is that the hall also has rows of desks built into the raised seating so that it can function as a lecture theatre and enough floor space to operate as our exam hall. Previously, as in most schools, the sports hall had to be sacrificed to the ever expanding exam season. Our 'saved' space has also gone into the sports facilities which are outstanding. In my view this is particularly important in an inner city school. They will be much used by local residents and local primary schools as well as the students and staff at Deptford Green. Some of our more quirky features include two out-door classrooms on the roof of the building, bright colour schemes and maritime regalia representing our four houses (named after historical ships), our own radio station, and zoned signage that adopts the six languages of the United Nations. All of which is done of course with just one thing in mind \u2013 promoting learning.</p> <p>We very much hope and expect the new Deptford Green school to be a tremendous success. We can already see the heightened self-esteem of our students as they come in to school each day \u2013 \"has somebody really built this for me?\" Well, yes. But the broader context is more sobering. We will be one of the last schools to go through this important, deeply worthwhile process. Whatever public money can be found for new schools is likely to be spread more thinly and in the new age of academies and federations answering directly to the secretary of state, I fear a more formulaic approach to building will ensue and the next generation of new schools will be as original in design as the next out of town supermarket. I really hope this isn't the case.</p> <p>Deptford Green, in its small way, is nudging forward the boundaries of education and other schools need to be given the chance to do the same. The alternative is to stand still and stagnate, which is exactly what we did for most of the 20th century. The pat response that \"we simply can't afford it\", is easier to roll out after the Olympic summer than it was after the previous summer of looting and riots. Can we afford not to? Whatever the future holds Deptford Green will be flying the flag for investment in new schools and for giving creative scope in their design to the people who work in them.</p> <p><em>Peter Campling is head teacher at <a href=\"http://www.deptfordgreen.lewisham.sch.uk/\">Deptford Green School</a>.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<h2>Ed Balls MP, Labour's shadow chancellor </h2> <p>It's good news that, with the help of the Olympics, Britain is finally out of the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. Our economy desperately needs an injection of confidence. But this is no time for complacency and wishful thinking. Today's figures show that underlying growth remains weak and that our economy is only just back to the same size as a year ago \u2014 twelve months of damaging flatlining which has seen borrowing rise in the first half of this year. And with living standards falling, more tax rises on the way, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, it would be very unwise of David Cameron and George Osborne to just sit back, cross their fingers and hope for the best. The complacent thing to do now is simply to wait and hope things will get better. The cautious thing to do is to act now to secure and strengthen growth in our economy.</p> <h2>Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors </h2> <p>The bounceback in GDP growth is good news but not enough to pop the champagne corks. More than half of the quarterly increase is attributable to the Olympics and the reversal of the jubilee effect in Q2. The key message is that we're out of recession but uncertain where we're going. Not for the first time we need to heed the warning that you can't see the road ahead through the rear view mirror. Our view is that growth will continue in Q4 but we have to recognise there could be a fallback.</p> <h2>John Walker, national chairman, Federation of Small Businesses </h2> <p>We welcome the news that GDP grew by 1% in the third quarter. The economy is going in the right direction, but there is still a long way to go. Growth has flatlined in the last year, so the chancellor must use the autumn statement to sustain recovery. Small firms want to grow and if this is to happen they need confidence in the economy. The government is moving in the right direction by announcing the small business bank, but we believe that also extending the national insurance contributions holiday to all micro-firms across the UK would add \u00a31.3bn to GDP, helping to entrench growth.</p> <h2>James Knightley, analyst at ING Bank</h2> <p>We are hopeful that positive GDP growth will continue in coming quarters, although a repeat of today's 1% growth rate is highly unlikely anytime soon. The drag from negative real household disposable income is fading given the sharp drop in inflation and the fact that employment and wages are rising. The Bank of England's funding for lending scheme should also boost lending capacity while lowering borrowing costs for households and small businesses. Meanwhile, fears of another round of austerity measures are also receding. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has suggested he is comfortable with some fiscal slippage as long as it is down to external weakness rather than domestic profligacy.</p> <p>However, external risks remain. The eurozone recession and sovereign debt worries plus concerns over the US fiscal cliff are likely to act as a drag on sentiment and exports. The recent run up in sterling is also a concern as it hurts competitiveness. This suggests to us more QE is likely in November to try and give the UK a bit more of a push.</p> <h2>Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance </h2> <p>Stronger economic growth than most forecasters expected over the summer is extremely welcome news.</p> <p>One quarter of growth doesn't change the overall picture of a weak and vulnerable recovery. The first estimate for each quarter's growth should always be taken with a pinch of salt, but the new figures suggest that all those people working hard at companies struggling out of the recession are starting to get results.</p> <p>If the government wants more of this kind of good news then they need to reform our dysfunctional tax system and create the right incentives for people to work, save and invest in Britain.</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit </h2> <p>The UK economy grew 1.0% in the third quarter, rebounding from a 0.4% decline in the second quarter and enjoying the strongest quarterly expansion for five years. The second quarter had seen a lost working day arising from the extra public holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee, so a bounce back was to be expected. If we make an allowance for the drop in output caused by the extra June holiday, the underlying trend in the economy is one of modest expansion over the past two quarters, with an acceleration in the third quarter due to a large extent to the Olympics.</p> <p>Business survey data suggest that the economy's underlying quarterly growth trend over the past two quarters has been more like 0.1-0.3%.</p> <p>Despite the third quarter improvement, the UK has grown by a mere 0.3% so far this year, with output unchanged in the third quarter compared to a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>The government will most likely make the most out of this good news, but unfortunately it is unlikely that the UK will see such a strong performance again for some time. In reality, the danger is that this figure fuels a misguided belief that the economy is on the mend, when in fact there is plenty of evidence to suggest that momentum is being lost again.</p> <h2>John Cridland, CBI director general</h2> <p>It's really encouraging news that growth has snapped back so strongly in the third quarter. Although the Olympics and jubilee have made up the majority of that growth, these numbers do also seem to point to some acceleration in underlying momentum.</p> <p>We expect conditions to remain positive going into the fourth quarter, reflecting some easing of the pressure on household budgets from lower inflation. But the global economic environment remains challenging.</p> <h2>Glenn Uniacke, senior dealer at Moneycorp</h2> <p>The markets had expected strong growth. What they got was the impression that a blue touch paper had been lit.</p> <p>For the economy to have lurched skyward after such a prolonged slump appears an impressive turnaround \u2026 but scratch a little deeper and the performance looks a little less scintillating.</p> <p>Much of the boost is due to one-off factors like the Olympics, and the natural rebound effect that follows a quarter in which working days are lost.</p> <p>So strip out the exceptional factors and the figure is less breathtaking \u2014 closer to zero. And after a pitiful start to the year, the annual trend is likely to be largely flat.</p> <p>With the promised supply side reforms yet to materialise, there's every chance that Q4 will disappoint compared to Q3's surge.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, IHS Global Insight </h2> <p>The economy is far from out of the woods with further relapses highly possible in the face of still tough domestic and global (especially eurozone) conditions. So it is premature for the chancellor to contemplate singing in his bathtub (or on the train).</p> <p>Meanwhile, it is now looking an extremely close call as to whether the Bank of England opts for more quantitative easing in November. Much could well depend on survey evidence on how the economy started off the fourth quarter.</p> <p>GDP growth coming in stronger than expected in the third quarter lowers the odds that the Bank of England will hold fire on more QE in November.</p> <p>Nevertheless, with recovery currently looking limited and far from guaranteed, we believe that the Bank of England will ultimately decide to give the economy a further helping hand \u2013 be it in November or delayed until early 2013. However, we acknowledge that the Bank of England could now be done on QE with seemingly split opinions within the MPC as to whether more QE is needed and a growing view within the committee that QE may now be becoming less effective.</p> <h2>Jason Conibear, trading director at Cambridge Mercantile </h2> <p>What have we learnt today? More than anything, perhaps, that the prime minister is no good at keeping secrets. We've emerged from the double dip but nobody is denying that we've had the wind behind us. It's hard to quantify but the real figure, minus the Olympic boost and other one-off factors, is likely to be roughly half this.</p> <p>We're back in the black and it's better than many had anticipated.</p> <p>This better than expected data comes on the back of a number of positives in recent weeks, not least falling inflation, unemployment and stronger retail sales, but major question marks remain over the UK economy. The UK economy is fundamentally tied to the eurozone, our biggest export market, and that keeps the domestic economic recovery on a knife edge. With the global economy as finely balanced as it is, there's every chance we could see more contraction during 2013.</p> <h2>Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management</h2> <p>No doubt this bounce will be passed off mainly as an Olympic boost, though a much larger influence is the volatility caused by the diamond jubilee holiday in June.</p> <p>Unless we have an unusual weather event, there should be no special factors in Q4, so we will get a better idea of the underlying growth picture when the next set of GDP data is published in January.</p> <p>The MPC appears to have been stepping back from a QE extension, so it would take much weaker news on the economy for them to make a policy move next month.</p> <h2>Andrew Sissons, researcher at the Work Foundation</h2> <p>The economy remains smaller today than it did this time a year ago, and that should be a serious cause for concern. While this quarter's growth corrects for the shallow double-dip recession, it should not be taken as a sign that a strong recovery is on the way.</p> <p>The most encouraging news here is the improvement in the production industries, particularly manufacturing. British manufacturing has had a turbulent year, but its growth is vital to a healthy and balanced recovery. Government must keep working to unlock business investment, to remove barriers to growth for the firms with the most potential, and to support innovation and entrepreneurship. Meaningful action on these priorities should be central to the chancellor's autumn statement in December.</p> <h2>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First </h2> <p>Falls in construction output are a real concern, inflationary pressures will weigh on the consumer expenditure portion while eurozone issues will keep international trade and sentiment. Enjoy the positivity while it lasts, I'm afraid we are not out of the woods yet.</p> <h2>Steve Box, UK head of trade and receivables finance at HSBC</h2> <p>Our Growing British Business report shows that the majority of UK businesses are confident of growth over the next two years, demonstrating the tenacity and determination with which business leaders are rolling up their sleeves and driving growth. Ultimately, the approach of these inspirational business leaders will have a positive knock-on effect for UK PLC as a whole.</p> <p>The rise in employment rates also reflects our report in that business leaders are planning to invest in staff over the next two years in order to grow their business.</p> <h2>Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation EEF</h2> <p>Output across manufacturing and the wider economy has mounted a strong rebound confirming that activity wasn't lost, just displaced from the previous quarter. This has to be regarded as a positive development, given the disappointing data in the year so far.</p> <p>However, a true account of the UK's economic performance has been skewed recently due to a series of one-off events, and this quarter is no different. The question is whether this first estimate is enough to signal an improvement in the underlying growth picture. With survey data, particularly in our major markets, pointing to difficult trading conditions in recent months, it's unlikely this pace of expansion will be maintained into the new year.</p>",
  "<p>Competing for customers online isn't easy.</p> <p>Unless you're an established brand, occupy a particular niche or you run a business that has fantastic local support, it's becoming increasingly difficult to stand out from the crowd and stake your claim in the global marketplace.</p> <p>Being a customer, on the other hand, is arguably becoming easier. Prior to the pervasively personalised web, going online used to entail facing an onslaught of ads and pop-ups from a plethora of brands all vying hungrily for a few precious seconds of our attention.</p> <p>Not any more.</p> <p>Now, the feeding frenzy has become an altogether subtler affair. Yet whether you consider this shift towards a tailored experience a blessing or blight, it would seem that we're increasingly coming to expect a coherent, appropriate online experience that more accurately reflects our needs.</p> <h2>Cultural context</h2> <p>Psychologists have long known that when it comes to shaping our behaviours and expectations, culture is <a href=\"http://westwood.wikispaces.com/file/view/Hofstede.pdf\" title=\"\">one of the most influential factors</a> out there.</p> <p>And so it is online. If you understand the cultural context of your users, you can tailor an online experience to their needs and desires, creating a sense of rapport and gaining their trust in the process \u2013 a process that is crucial to generating brand advocacy and sustainable success for your business.</p> <p>What you may not know is that within this cultural context sits another, highly influential factor: your gender. And there's a strong connection between the two.</p> <p>When it comes to websites, <a href=\"http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/the-impact-of-culture-and-gender-on-web-sites-an-empirical-study-iDVqDNkhGk\" title=\"\">research has found</a> that more individualist cultures (such as the UK and USA) express bigger gender differences in how usable and attractive we perceive a website to be, than more collectivist cultures (such as China).</p> <p>But it doesn't stop there \u2013 your gender also influences why you go online, and what you do when you're there.</p> <h2>Yes, boys do like review sites more</h2> <p>For instance, which gender would you assume spends more time online?</p> <p>If you answered women, guess again. <a href=\"www.nielsen.com/content/  dam/corporate/us/en/reports-downloads/2011-Reports/nielsen-social-media-report.pdf\" title=\"\">Men tend to be the heaviest internet users</a>, spending more time on review sites, entertainment and online videos than women, by a long shot. In fact, this gender difference exists even at a young age \u2013 <a href=\"http://mediatel.co.uk/newsline/2010/11/18/tgi-digital-kids\" title=\"\">boys are more likely</a> to seek out and be influenced by online reviews before making a purchase than their female peers.</p> <p>Yet where men rule online entertainment, <a href=\"http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/547/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1010937901821.pdf?auth66=1350921646_a456690c8e464fc26c36fc67a1f4860b&amp;ext=.pdf\" title=\"\">women rule email</a>. Linked to heightened levels of oestrogen, the stereotype of the loquacious (or as I prefer, verbally proficient) woman appears to have migrated from the real world and into the online arena.</p> <h2>Online shopping: a risky business</h2> <p>As consumers, we haven't always been comfortable with e-commerce. In fact <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1287024\" title=\"\">research shows</a> that we still require greater trust when making an online purchase than when we're buying something face to face, a trend that also has gender-specific traits.</p> <p>For instance when it comes to online shopping, although we may do more of it, <a href=\"http://www.marketingprof.net/files/Gender_differences_in_the_perceived_risk.pdf\" title=\"\">women tend to perceive it as riskier</a>. We're <a href=\"http://www.diannecyr.com/docs/Gender%20and%20website%20design%20(IJEB)%20final.pdf\" title=\"\">more sceptical</a> of online information than men and we're also <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Social-Media-and-Young-Adults.aspx\" title=\"\">more likely to blog anonymously</a> and <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-77995-9/#section=244678&amp;page=1&amp;locus=0\" title=\"\">provide inaccurate personal information</a> when asked for it.</p> <p>Men, on the other hand, are <a href=\"http://www.diannecyr.com/docs/Gender%20and%20website%20design%20(IJEB)%20final.pdf\" title=\"\">much less concerned about privacy</a>, and are <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.93.8177%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&amp;ei=826FUOStHurU0QXvyYCIBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGq-dD3GZJ94a2TrlxdYAY8m4F1GA&amp;sig2=IHj5PijjowDhuUwAbO77mQ\" title=\"\">happier to part with sensitive personal information</a> (such as their phone number and address) than women.</p> <h2>So what does it matter?</h2> <p>As innocuous as these gender differences may appear, they can actually have a profound impact on the way in which we engage with one another online.</p> <p>That's why this knowledge is so vital.

  "<p>As the chief executive of Wrap, the resource efficiency delivery body for all four UK governments, I am acutely aware of the financial and environmental issues facing UK businesses.</p> <p>Raw material prices are rising, population is increasing, and resources are diminishing, and connected to this is the necessity to generate revenue and improve market share.</p> <p>The grocery industry is no different. It is currently grappling with the impacts of climate change, a poor harvest and food security issues, while ensuring products make it to the shelf for consumers. This is the backdrop to the <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/courtauld-commitment-2-0\" title=\"\">Courtauld Commitment 2</a>, a voluntary agreement to improve resource efficiency and reduce the carbon impact of the UK grocery sector.</p> <p>Why do I think the Courtauld Commitment 2 is important? UK businesses consume 600m tonnes of materials per annum, around a third of which ends up as waste and much of which could have been used productively.</p> <p>The aim of this voluntary agreement is to challenge the sector and its supply chain to tackle the most resource intensive areas through stretching targets:</p> <p>\u2022 To reduce the carbon impact of grocery packaging by 10% by reducing the weight, increasing recycling rates and the recycled content of all grocery packaging.</p> <p>\u2022 To reduce household food and drink wastes by 4%.</p> <p>\u2022 To reduce traditional grocery product and packaging waste in the grocery supply chain by 5%.</p> <p>(The three Courtauld Commitment 2 targets are measured against a 2009 baseline.)</p> <p>Recently announced year two results are hugely encouraging, with a considerable reduction in supply chain of 8.8% less against the 5% target. The packaging result of 8.2% is more than three quarters of the way towards the 10% target of carbon reduction and a 3% reduction against 4% for household food waste builds on the 1.1m tonnes reduction achieved between 2006/7-2010.</p> <p>These results are indicative of the grocery sector's desire to take action, reduce its carbon impacts, waste less and ultimately, put less pressure on resources.</p> <p>I am often asked why Wrap has set targets and helps focus delivery; why isn't the sector doing this on its own? This is surprisingly easy to answer. We act as a catalyst, accelerating changes in the behaviour of consumers, public and private sectors in ways that neither governments nor individual companies can. The Courtauld Commitment is pioneering. It enables signatories such as large retailers and brands to move the sector forward collectively, while stimulating competition through their own individual bold delivery methods.</p> <p>Take Easter egg packaging, for example. No individual company or retailer wanted to impact sales by moving on its own to make packaging innovation changes, but by moving collectively, packaging was cut by 25% and, in some cases, by as much as 50% in 2009 \u2013 a result delivered by leading confectionery brands, manufacturers and retailers.</p> <p>The second question I am routinely asked is whether retailers and household names are doing enough? But what is enough? It's clear from the results that the sector is exceeding expectation, particularly in the supply chain, which is a new area of focus for many. Sainsbury's has been particularly progressive: its <a href=\"http://2sustain.com/2010/06/sainsbury%E2%80%99s-uses-real-time-supply-chain-technology-to-improve-efficiency-reduce-waste.html\" title=\"\">real time supply chain system</a> trial in convenience stores resulted in an increase in on-shelf availability of 2.2% and a cut in product waste by 2%. It is difficult to introduce a system change but it had a dramatic impact, so worth the effort.</p> <p>An innovation which has targeted both household food waste and packaging is the Heinz Beanz resealable plastic pack that can be kept in the fridge and keeps the product fresh for five days. It also includes a transparent portion guide so there is no excuse to waste even a bean. Wasted food is wasted money. UK households currently throw away 7.2m tonnes of food a year; more than half could have been eaten, offering a saving of around \u00a312bn pounds.</p> <p>But it's not just the brands that have come up with new creations that form part of the weekly shop; supermarkets are also doing their bit too. M&amp;S has rolled out new labels on everyday products with one single date and improved freezing guidance, replacing the previous confusing labels we have been used to.</p> <p>These initiatives are just some of the great ways in which organisations are tackling the issues. But the challenges posed by a rising population and ever-decreasing resources are not going to be managed by individual action.

The Council of Ministers would therefore need to improvise one according to its own design.</p> <p>Second, an independent Scotland could either be considered a successor state, inheriting the United Kingdom\u2019s rights and status, or a new applicant, but would have no automatic right to the former. A political decision would have to be taken by the Council of Ministers acting unanimously.</p> <p>Third, even if Scotland was granted the status of a successor state, there would still have to be extensive negotiations to disentangle Scotland\u2019s legal and financial obligations from those of the United Kingdom. There would be no certainty that Scotland would get a good deal out of those negotiations given that it would be UK rather than Scottish ministers sitting in the relevant EU decision-making bodies.</p> <p>What emerges from this is that the real determining factors are political rather than legal. The status and rights of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU would be decided by a body comprised of twenty-seven countries (possibly more by the time it happens), any one of which might use its veto to block the process in pursuit of its own national interests and to the detriment of Scotland\u2019s.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/2012/10/25/real-choices-for-labour/\">\u2022 Progress has launched the Purple Papers, an attempt to start a debate on the hard policy choices that would face a Labour government in 2015.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The election of Helle Thorning-Schmidt\u2019s social democrats in Denmark last October and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France this year were notable exceptions. The fate of both, though, should be at the forefront of Ed Miliband\u2019s mind as he builds on the momentum of his \u2018One Nation Labour\u2019 conference address.</p> <p>Six months after its election victory, Thorning-Schmidt\u2019s party had plummeted to 16 per cent in the polls, its lowest ratings in a century. In France, Hollande has seen the sharpest decline in popularity of any newly elected president in the history of the fifth republic. Hollande\u2019s socialist deputies and their Green allies are in revolt against the president\u2019s request that they approve the European fiscal pact he disingenuously vowed to renegotiate. The Red-Green Alliance, which formed part of the electoral bloc that brought Thorning-Schmidt to power, are up in arms at the prime minister\u2019s tight fiscal policy and centrist welfare reforms. While the fate of neither government is by any means sealed, both are suffering from a failure to prepare the voters prior to coming to office for the tough decisions they would have to take.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/10/miliband-sneaking-power-without-plan-government\">\u2022 Rafael Behr at the New Statesman says Ed Miliand needs to prepare the voters for what Labour might need to do in 2015.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Miliband's] plan involves promising epoch-defining change to the way society and the economy are structured without divisive talk of winners and losers \u2013 the cosy one-nation revolution.

We can see that with unemployment falling, with a quarter of the deficit paid down in the last two years. There is more to do but these figures are good progress.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While any growth in the economy is to be welcomed, the picture is clouded by the artificial boost to the economy generated by Olympic ticket sales \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime occasion - which was responsible for 0.2 per cent of this growth.</p> <p>\u201cToo much of the growth is centred on London and the service sector, a more realistic indicator is that the construction industry is still in the doldrums and its contribution to the last quarter\u2019s GDP figures declined by 2.5 per cent.</p> <p>David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s austerity polices are still causing serious problems to the economy which remains flat. If you strip away the economic fillip created by the Olympic ticket sales, you have an economy stuck on the starting blocks with anaemic growth, and you still have the food banks on the rise and long-term unemployment on the increase.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s really encouraging news that growth has snapped back so strongly in the third quarter. Although the Olympics and Jubilee have made up the majority of that growth, these numbers do also seem to point to some acceleration in underlying momentum.</p> <p>We expect conditions to remain positive going into the fourth quarter, reflecting some easing of the pressure on household budgets from lower inflation. But the global economic environment remains challenging.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Jonathan Edwards</strong>, the Plaid Cyrmu Treasury spokesman</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures today showing a return to growth in the past quarter are very welcome but the reality is that the economy has flatlined in the past year and for most people life is harder than before the crash.</p> <p>In Wales, we still have 50,000 more people unemployed than in 2007, showing the need for Leanne Wood\u2019s Plan C programme to create jobs in Wales. A Party of Wales government would be a real boost for Wales.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Graeme Leach</strong>, chief economist at the Institute of Directors</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bounce back in GDP growth is good news but not enough to pop the champagne corks. More than half of the quarterly increase is attributable to the Olympics and the reversal of the Jubilee effect in Q2.</p> <p>The key message is that we\u2019re out of recession but uncertain where we\u2019re going. Not for the first time we need to heed the warning that you can\u2019t see the road ahead through the rear view mirror.</p> <p>Our view is that growth will continue in Q4 but we have to recognise there could be a fallback.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Tony Dolphin</strong>, the IPPR's chief economist</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Weak growth for the past two years can be partly accounted for by the combination of high food and energy prices, which have hit consumers hard, exports falling short of expectations due to the euro crisis and a shortage of credit for small businesses which has led to weak business investment.

I've taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome,</a> the BBC and the Press Association.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Duncan Smith said that families living on benefits, and very wealthy families, were more likely to have large numbers of children than families on average incomes.</strong> That was because families on average incomes had to decide how many children they could afford, he said. Families living on benefits should be forced to make the same decisions, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When you look at families across the board in all incomes, you find that the vast majority make decisions about the numbers of children they can have, the families they want, based on what they think they can afford and how it\u2019s going to work. Where you see the clustering of large families is really down at the very lowest incomes \u2013 those on significantly levels of welfare \u2013 and those on the very top incomes. In other words, the problem for those who are paying the taxes, paying the bills - they make the decisions about their lives, even if they would sometimes have extra children, they make decisions. People who are having support through welfare are often free from that decision.</p> </blockquote> <p>Duncan Smith said he wanted to support out-of-work families with children. But he also wanted to make them realise that \"you have to cut your cloth in accordance with what capabilities and what finances you have.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he was considering capping child-related benefits for families after they have more than two children.</strong> \"My view, if you did this, you would start it for people who begin to have more than, say, two children,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was right to cap housing benefits because paying more than \u00a3100,000 a year for some families was \"madness\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said benefits should be \"temporary\" for most people and that the welfare system should encourage people to find work.</strong> This was what universal credit would do, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Benefits should be for many people \u2013 unless you\u2019re chronically sick \u2013 a temporary place. It\u2019s a place you then move on into work. And we want to help you do that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the current welfare system \"destroys lives\" because it allows people who should be working to remain on benefits long-term.</strong> That was why the government was reforming the system, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have accepted far too long in this country that it is possible just to stay on benefits, that we write them off, and we work only with those who get up in the morning and go to work. And that\u2019s simply not acceptable. It\u2019s not acceptable because it destroys their lives; it also destroys the lives of taxpayers who have to pick up that bill to pay for them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50890aeb95cb4897f0db52ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:48:27.841Z\">10.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-98771c64-8a0b-4fdd-857d-5567f1d8217e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351158402840/03803a12-ef80-406a-bd60-3a8579f99cb1-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Ed Balls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor  Photograph: Allstar Picture Library/Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar Picture Library / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ed Balls</strong>, the shadow chancellor, has now put out a statement about the GDP figures. Here it is in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's good news that, with the help of the Olympics, Britain is finally out of the longest double-dip recession since the Second World War. Our economy desperately needs an injection of confidence. But this is no time for complacency and wishful thinking.</p> <p>Today's figures show that underlying growth remains weak and that our economy is only just back to the same size as a year ago - twelve months of damaging flatlining which has seen borrowing rise in the first half of this year.<br>And with living standards falling, more tax rises on the way, small business lending down and the eurozone still in crisis, it would be very unwise of David Cameron and George Osborne to just sit back, cross their fingers and hope for the best. The complacent thing to do now is simply to wait and hope things will get better. The cautious thing to do is to act now to secure and strengthen growth in our economy.&#xa0;</p> <p>Britain needs a plan to secure and sustain a strong economic recovery, including using funds from the 4G mobile spectrum auction to build 100,000 affordable homes, a temporary VAT cut and a bank bonus tax to fund jobs for young people out of work. We also need action to ease the squeeze for people on low and middle incomes, rather than a tax cut for millionaires. And we need long-term changes to make our economy stronger, including a long-term plan to rebuild our infrastructure and radical reform of the banks.</p> <p>In the two years since the spending review our economy has grown by just 0.6 per cent, compared to the 4.6 per cent George Osborne said his plan would deliver and growth of 3.4 per cent in the USA and 3.3 per cent in Germany. So the question for the coming months is whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years and not keep falling behind as other countries move ahead.</p> <p>A one-off boost from the Olympics is welcome. But it is no substitute for a plan to secure and sustain the strong recovery that Britain desperately needs if we are to create jobs, get the deficit down and make people better off.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5089064d95cb4897f0db52e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:28:45.935Z\">10.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Scotland the SNP government is doing its best to draw a line under the controversy about Alex Salmond misleading voters about non-existent legal advice.

First, today's figures include a bounce of at least 0.5% due to <a href=\"http://www.markit.com/assets/en/docs/commentary/markit-economics/2012/oct/UK_PMI_all_sector_12_10_03.pdf\">lost output</a> from the Jubilee bank holiday and <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/national-accounts/articles/2011-present/impact-of-the-olympics/measuring-the-impact-of-the-olympics-on-the-national-accounts---download.pdf\">sales of Olympic tickets and TV rights</a> all scoring in the third quarter.</p> <p>Second, 80% of the spending cuts are still to come. As the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/02/pdf/c1.pdf\">IMF admitted</a> earlier this month, austerity may have had a bigger impact on growth than previously predicted.

GDP was estimated to have increased by 1.0 per cent in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The largest contribution to the increase came from the services sector. There was also an increase in activity in the production sector. Activity in the construction sector fell. The latest GDP estimate was affected by the changes made to the quarter two Bank Holidays in May and June 2012 as part of the celebrations for the Queens Diamond Jubilee. The end of May bank holiday moved to June and there was an additional day's holiday in June. Over the second quarter, this resulted in one fewer working days. The change to the bank holidays was not a regular event so no adjustment was made to account for it as part of the seasonal adjustment process. This means that any impact of the changes fed directly through to the GDP estimate ...</p> <p>In addition to the impact of the bank holiday changes, the latest GDP estimate was affected by the Olympics and Paralympics events in the third quarter. The Olympics took place from 27 July to 12 August 2012 (with a few events starting on 25 July), and the Paralympics from 29 August to 9 <br>September. The events were likely to have impacted on the economy in a number of ways (note that \u2018Olympic\u2019 or \u2018Olympics\u2019 below refers to both the Olympics and Paralympic events):</p> <p>\u2022 Sports activities, amusement and recreation: tickets for the Olympics were sold in tranches through 2011 and 2012 but, in accordance with national accounts principles, these have been allocated to the third quarter, when the output actually occurred. The impact of the ticket sales <br>on GDP can be clearly seen in the lower level data for sports activities, which is part of the Government and other services aggregate in Table B1. Ticket sales were estimated to have increased GDP in the quarter by about 0.2 percentage points</p> <p>\u2022 Employment activities: employment agencies showed some strength in the quarter and it is possible that some of this strength was related to the Olympics. However, there was no direct evidence from survey respondents to support this</p> <p>\u2022 Creative arts and entertainment activities: the arts and entertainment sector has been showing some strength for some time, with quite strong growth in the most recent quarter. There was some evidence from survey returns that output was higher in July and August because of the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Office administration: office administration was quite strong in the quarter but the evidence on any Olympic effect was mixed, with some respondents suggesting that it may have had an adverse effect, as opposed to explaining the strength</p> <p>\u2022 Accommodation: hotels showed greater activity in the quarter and this was one area where one might expect to see an Olympic effect, albeit mainly in London. There was some evidence from survey returns that output was higher in July and August because of the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Food and beverage services: there was some strength in the food and drink sector and some evidence from survey returns that part of this might have been due to the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Land transport: there was some strength in parts of the transport sector and some evidence from survey returns that this might have been due to the Olympics</p> <p>\u2022 Retail: retail showed some strength in the quarter but there was very little evidence of any significant Olympic effect. Indeed there was some feedback from online retailers that sales were lower as consumers watched the Olympics instead of shopping online</p> <p>\u2022 Motion picture, video and TV programme production: the data here were quite weak for the quarter and there was some evidence from survey respondents to support this weakness - 'people watching the Olympics instead'</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T09:29:24.787Z\">at 10.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f97695cb4897f0db52d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:33:58.669Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/gva/gross-domestic-product--preliminary-estimate/q3-2012/index.html\">Here is the Office for National Statistics news release about the GDP figures.</a></p> <p>And here is <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_284925.pdf\">the ONS statistical bulletin with the full details (pdf).</a></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:34:38.459Z\">at 9.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f8ae95cb4897f0db52d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:30:38.973Z\">9.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 Growth was up by 1% in Q3, the ONS says.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:31:03.627Z\">at 9.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088f78eb5794584b1c13f2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-25T08:25:50.246Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8135554b-a8f9-474d-a431-a250aecc2cd6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351153331500/816a87bc-1412-4ac9-bff5-dfea368189bc-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Sir William Beveridge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir William Beveridge.

At 9.30am we are expected to hear that Britain is out of recession. It\u2019s not really a \u201ccrack-open-the-champagne\u201d moment; the double-dip was never expected to happen in the first place, and when David Cameron came to power, anyone predicting that Britain would spend the first half of 2012 in recession would have been branded an extreme pessimist.

Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said even if the economy were to grow by 1% in the third quarter, it would only take the level of activity back to where it was a year ago. \u201cThe question is what the underlying growth rate of the economy is when we strip out the one-off Olympics and bank holiday effects,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat really matters for jobs, living standards and the deficit is whether there is a strong and sustained recovery and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/25/eurozone-crisis-live-britain-emerges-from-recession\">here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s business live blog, which will be taking the lead in covering the figures.</a> Here I will be focusing on the political reaction.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the full agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The GDP figures for the third quarter of 2012 (Q3, in the jargon).

  "<p>Growing up in 1980s Bradford, I always knew I'd take the traditional route to marriage. If I harboured teenage dreams of walking down the aisle to marry a man I loved, then my fantasy was blighted by the insurmountable burden of breaking away from my family. Besides, I'd always known I was lined up to marry a cousin \u2013 my uncle's son.</p> <p>He was as good a suitor as any. I reasoned that an educated, outgoing, well-travelled professional would make the sort of husband who would afford me the freedom to pursue my own career.</p> <p>British Muslim friends who had married before me warned of the importance of considering the environment that I'd be marrying into. For instance, living independently was always preferable since it limited day-to-day interference from the in-laws. The size of household was worth thinking about. I didn't want to have to please too many in-laws or spend too long in the kitchen. I also needed to consider my future mother-in-law's disposition because her backing could make or break the union.</p> <p>My mother had her own criteria. She wanted a son-in-law of good stock, who was respectable and responsible with the sort of traditional career that would always pay the mortgage \u2013 my mum's way of offering me long-term security.</p> <p>The suitor's social class was critical. Rather than a union between two individuals, this was a family merger, so mum needed to ensure the bond was sustainable. While we would never marry beneath us, we also didn't want the pressure of keeping up appearances by forming an alliance with people above our station.</p> <p>Mum has several cousins in her ancestral village in Pakistan who never married because their families couldn't identify men of a suitable social class for them. In a couple of cases, property was the issue. Since the bride takes a share of her father's property to her new family, a daughter's betrothal outside existing kinship networks can create a division of wealth, which is usually unwelcome. The same practice was prevalent among British nobility during Elizabethan times, when marriages were seen as alliances between two families which also helped to preserve prestige and wealth.</p> <p>Marriages like mine were based entirely on practicalities rather than emotions. Perhaps that's why we never talked about love when I was growing up. In fact, love is still the elephant in the room among Pakistani women of my mum's generation. They shun the subject as a weakness or \u2013 worse still \u2013 as a western concept which threatens to destabilise their preferred system of making marriages. This was certainly the case during my ill-fated relationship. I had presumed love would grow naturally; if I complained about its absence, I was told it was patience and staying power I lacked.</p> <p>I wanted to understand this attitude, so I set out to explore the experience of love and marriage among different generations of Muslim women in and around Bradford. The first generation \u2013 the ones that married migrant mill workers like my father during the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 talked about marriage rather than love, viewing the latter as a frivolity rather than a vital ingredient. There was little time for coupledom in their marriages, it seems, and love was something that took place in the dead of night, strictly behind closed doors.</p> <p>Rukeeya (not her real name) is now in her late 60s. She was 17 when her marriage was arranged with a family associate in Karachi, where she spent several years living with in-laws, before her husband secured work in Bradford. Not dwelling on love and happiness, she says, was a survival technique because \"it was out of your hands\". Instead, Rukeeya focused on being an ideal daughter-in-law which involved \"forsaking my own wishes in favour of others\" and \"keeping your tongue in check\".</p> <p>Changing attitudes appear to be driven largely by the British-born daughters of the migrant mill workers. Longstanding models of marriage, which offer security and family approval, are still dominant. What is different though is that British Muslim women like 45-year-old Noreen (not her real name) are now recognising and articulating their emotional needs:</p> <p>\"You know that passionate fantasised love inside a woman? I don't feel that kind of love. It's a different love altogether. It's a caring love. It's kicked in now in my life as we've got older, as I've got used to my husband's way of life.\"</p> <p>Perhaps it's because their mothers didn't talk to them about love, that the first generation of British-born Pakistani women are keen to ensure that their daughters prioritise emotional wellbeing when it's their time to choose a life partner.</p> <p>\u2022 Irna Qureshi's latest work, <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/whats-on/BHM/Cartographies-of-love/\" title=\"\">Cartographies of Love</a>, is a live performance based on intimate conversations with three generations of Muslim women in West Yorkshire.</p>",
  "<p>The shooting of schoolgirl <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/09/pakistan-girl-shot-activism-swat-taliban\" title=\"\">Malala Yousafzai</a> by the Taliban in Pakistan shed renewed attention on the plight of women in this corner of the world. Malala survived, thankfully, and is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/15/pakistani-schoolgirl-taliban-uk-treatment\" title=\"\">now in the UK receiving treatment</a>. But across the border in Afghanistan, many women are beaten, raped and executed.</p> <p>Even a decade after the fall of the Taliban \u2013 during which \u00a330bn has been spent on aid to Afghanistan \u2013 the freedom and rights of Afghan women are under grave threat.</p> <p>UK aid has achieved much in Afghanistan. Millions of children are now in school, markets are bustling, and the government has shown some important improvements in their ability to deliver services. But the UK parliament's international development committee, which I chair, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/25/afghanistan-viable-state-flawed-ambition\" title=\"\">published a report on Thursday</a> identifying the status of women as the key determinant of how much has changed in Afghanistan and what the UK government could and should do to maintain the gains that have been made.</p> <p>Afghanistan remains one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/15/worst-place-women-afghanistan-india\" title=\"\">worst places in the world to be a woman</a>. Although great progress has been made in improving the rights of women \u2013 notably bringing down maternal mortality and getting girls into school in the early years \u2013 these gains are under threat.</p> <p>While some have argued that the Taliban have softened their stance on women, recent developments suggest otherwise. The Taliban are a divided force, with some wanting to be part of change while others maintain a hardline stance forcing school closures and worse. Students in Kandahar were forced to watch as their teacher and headteacher were executed for ignoring Taliban orders to stop educating girls.</p> <p>But it's not just the Taliban that are the problem. In March, President Hamid Karzai endorsed a statement from clerics that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/06/hamid-karzai-afghanistan-womens-rights\" title=\"\">allowed husbands to beat their wives</a> under certain circumstances. A shocking <a href=\"http://www.globalrights.org/site/DocServer/final_DVR_JUNE_16.pdf?docID=9803\" title=\"\">87% of Afghan women will suffer domestic abuse in their lifetime</a> (pdf). Those who fight back are often punished for their extraordinary courage. Hundreds of women have been locked in Afghan jails for \"moral\" crimes, such as running away from home after being beaten or raped. Female politicians, doctors, teachers and activists are increasingly under attack. This year, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission warned that there has been a <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/04/afghanistan-honourkilling-idINDEE8630DN20120704\" title=\"\">sharp rise in so-called \"honour\" killings</a> and violent attacks on women and girls.</p> <p>At the same time women have told us they are determined that the gains in educational and employment opportunities will be defended. We were also given evidence that a growing minority of men recognise the benefits of having educated wives and daughters.</p> <p>These brave women and girls deserve our full and unflagging support. But it is unclear how DfID delivers this. We could only find two projects funded by UK taxpayers \u2013 out of nearly 100 \u2013 that have a direct and explicit focus on women and girls. More must be spent in ways that work to secure their future, such as projects focused on education and economic opportunities as well as domestic violence shelters and support for female police and lawyers to help victims of violence.</p> <p>Elections for the next president in 2014, and for parliament in 2015, will be critical to securing Afghanistan's future. Karzai cannot stand again and it is unclear who will succeed him. Women comprise more than a quarter of elected politicians \u2013 more than in many of the world's most developed democracies \u2013 but how many will be willing to risk their lives to run for office the next time around?</p> <p>Women have been all but excluded from fledgling political talks, and many fear their freedom will be traded away in a deal with the Taliban.</p> <p>Many British soldiers have died or been injured in the attempt to give Afghanistan a better future. The treatment of women after troops pull out in 2014 will be the litmus test of whether we have succeeded in improving the lives of ordinary Afghans. Even after the soldiers leave, we can and must do more to support them. The new DfID secretary, Justine Greening, and David Cameron, the prime minister, have a real opportunity to combat violence and discrimination against women in Afghanistan by making help for women a real focus of UK aid.</p>",

On Wednesday Ai tweeted a cover version of South Korean rapper Psy's enormously popular music video, featuring the hefty 55-year-old artist \u2013 brow furrowed, grey-bearded, sunglasses on \u2013 dancing frenetically with a cohort of associates in his Beijing courtyard studio.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the four-minute video Ai, wearing a bright pink shirt and black suit, imitates Psy's signature horse-riding dance and at one stage loses his sunglasses in the process. The footage is spliced with clips from Psy's original video but none of it showing the rapper himself. About 55 seconds in Ai pulls a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and waves them above his head, a possible reference to the 81 days he spent in detention last spring.</p> <p>Ai's parody is titled Grass Mud Horse Style after an alpaca-like animal invented by China's web users as a protest against internet censorship \u2013 its pronunciation in Chinese (Cao Ni Ma) sounds similar to a profane insult, forbidden on the country's social networking sites. Ai's 2011 work Grass Mud Horse Blocking the Centre shows a nude Ai holding a Grass Mud Horse plush toy over his genitals \u2013 the title sounds like an obscenity hurled directly at China's central party leadership.&#xa0;</p> <p>PSY's Gangnam Style has more than 530m views and counting on YouTube. On Tuesday the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, met with the rapper to commend him on his international appeal. \"You are so cool; I hope that you can end the global warming,\" Ban said, according to Reuters.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398268885\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/24/1351077823815/Gangam-style-Ban-Ki-Moon--004.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/24/121024GangamMoon-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121024GangamMoon/121024GangamMoon.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/24/121024GangamMoon-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/24/121024GangamMoon_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/24/121024GangamMoon_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>Ai continues to be a looming presence in the international art world. He's the subject of a sprawling exhibition at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC called Ai Weiwei: According to What? Recently he has contributed commentaries to The Guardian and guest-edited an issue of the New Statesman.</p> <p>Yet Ai's troubles with the government are far from over. Since his release in June authorities have kept him under close watch. They refuse to return his passport, barring him from accepting a faculty position at Berlin's University of the Arts. In late September Ai and his company Fake Cultural Development lost their final appeal against a $2.4m tax fine.</p> <p>\"Ai Weiwei's art and his activism resonate far beyond the art world and encourage an expanded dialogue on crucial social, cultural, and political issues of the day,\" Hirshhorn museum director Richard Koshalek said in an exhibit catalogue, according to CNN.</p> <p>He's a pretty good dancer to boot.</p>",

Omar Infante is up next, he checks his swing on a 2-2 fastball and is called out by the first base ump, much to the pleasure of the home crowd.&#xa0;</p> <p>That means two down for Cabrera - he walked his first time up. Here he hits a line drive that's taking a dive heading for the turf but here comes Gregor Blanco who makes a sliding catch!

That's exciting right? The bad news? Well, you're facing Justin Verlander in Game One, who just happens to be one of the filthiest pitchers as anyone breathing has ever laid eyes on...and he's well rested. Gulp.&#xa0;</p> <p>More bad news for you orange wearing crazies - your hitters have had exactly three extra base hits against Mr. Verlander, none of which were home runs. But hey, look on the bright side, the Giants haven't hit the long ball all season long, and look where you are, the Fall Classic!</p> <p>Yes, there's always a&#xa0;glimmer&#xa0;of hope, and anything can happen in baseball. So what if the NLCS MVP, Marco Scutaro, the player who has been the driving force behind your teams success, has seen Verlander more than any other Giant and is hitting, um, .176 against him in 26 plate appearances.</p> <p>Now we are an impartial publication here and so we've gotta be fair - this good news bad news thing works both ways, and it's not all statistical smiles and jumping jacks for the favored for the Tigers. Barry Zito, the man on the mound for the home team, owns Prince Fielder (.167 BA) and seems to have had a reasonable handle on Miguel Cabrera (.250BA). We're not talking about huge batting samples here for either side, but in a big, fat, spacious ballpark, with a white hot pitcher going for the visitors, and the home team hurler looking for redemption, runs could very well be at a premium out in San Francisco.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hey, but even if the stats say this or that, we still have to actually play this game to find out what's really going to happen, and I am all fired up for the pomp, circumstance, the national anthem and billion dollar fighter jets, not to mention the baseball. First pitch isn't far from now, and if you wan't to get an idea of what it's like to be at AT&amp;T Park, go out, grab some french fries, and then smother them with garlic - the local specialty - that will do the trick.

  "<p>Peter Lilley, a climate change sceptic and oil company director, has been appointed to the House of Commons energy and climate change select committee.</p> <p>Lilley was one of only three MPs to vote against the Climate Change Act in 2008. He is also vice-chairman and senior independent non-executive director of Tethys Petroleum Ltd, an oil and gas company with operations in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p> <p>The 11-member committee is appointed by the Commons to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the Department of Energy and Climate Change and its associated public bodies.</p> <p>In a parliamentary debate in 2009, the Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden said: \"The simple fact is that the science [behind climate change] is not resolved.\"</p> <p>Lilley, who was a cabinet minister in the Thatcher and Major governments, has repeatedly criticised economist Nicholas Stern's six-year-old report into the economic impact of climate change, which warned the costs of doing nothing to prevent global warming would be devastating.</p> <p>In a report published last month, What is wrong with Stern?, the MP claimed the Stern report \"was not fit for purpose\" and called on the government to adopt more gradual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>He claimed that while Stern's conclusions were considered \"incontrovertible truth\" six years ago, \"the mood has changed since the recession\".</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2012 to say that Lilley was one of only three - not five - MPs to vote against the act.</p>"
