  "<p>Aston Villa are prepared to end their interest in signing the Belgium international Christian Benteke unless Genk reduce their demands.</p> <p>The Midlands club have submitted a straight \u20ac7m (\u00a35.5m) offer for the 21-year-old striker, which is an improvement on their previous bid of \u20ac6m up front and a further \u20ac1m to follow in add-ons, and have made it clear that they will walk away from the deal if Genk continue to play hard-ball. Genk are asking for double Villa's \u00a35.5m valuation, which has frustrated Benteke, who failed to report for training on Wednesday and seems unlikely to feature in the Europa League game Lucerne on Thursday.</p> <p>The 22-year-old Middlesbrough left-back Joe Bennett has joined Villa on a four-year deal for a fee believed to be in the region of \u00a32.75m. \"Joe's a really good player, young and hungry to succeed and he's exactly the type of player we want here at the football club,\" said the Villa manager, Paul Lambert. \"There's no doubt in my mind that he will thrive in this environment and he fits in exactly with what we are trying to build here.\"</p> <p>In a rather surprising move, Villa are also expected to announce in the next 24 hours that they have signed the 21-year-old Chesterfield forward Jordan Bowery in a \u00a3500,000 deal.</p>",

  "<p>The massacre at Lonmin's Marikana mine, which saw 34 people die after the police shot striking miners, looks like becoming a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/29/south-africa-lonmin-mine-massacre-nationalisation?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">tipping point</a> for South Africa's governing African National Congress. It's hard to overestimate the impact that scenes once so associated with apartheid will have now they are replayed under a black, democratic government.</p> <p>Marikana showed that a black life, 18&#xa0;years after racism was supposed to have been banished, still often counts for very little, and that the inequality between the rich (mostly white) and the poor (mostly black) has remained unchanged \u2013 although a small black elite, from the ranks of senior ANC leaders, public servants and trade unions, has become fabulously rich.</p> <p>Immediately after the killings, white and black business leaders, such as the business tycoon <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Ramaphosa\" title=\"\">Cyril Ramaphosa</a> (the former National Union of Mineworkers general secretary) and Chamber of Mines chief executive Bheki Sibiya, have called for a national debate involving politicians, business and labour leaders about how to spread economic benefits more fairly across the nation.</p> <p>Nowhere is inequality more obvious than in the mining sector, the focal point of black slave-labour conditions. The leadership of the NUM has been accused by a new breakaway union, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu), of having benefited from the new South Africa while little has changed for ordinary miners. The Marikana mine itself is symbolic of the wealth gap. Black politicians are on the board, and through the government's Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) scheme there are also black shareholders.</p> <p>Many mainstream (white) companies have devoted resources to BEE \u2013 which benefits a handful of black businesspeople \u2013 rather than spend the money on adopting poor schools, training workers, or building houses for the surrounding communities where they operate, which could lift thousands out of poverty.</p> <p>The massacre may yet push Jacob Zuma out of the ANC and the presidency. The ANC will hold a leadership election at a conference in December. Zuma's opponents are using Marikana to argue that he is an ineffective leader \u2014 and that if he remains head of the ANC, the party may even lose power.</p> <p>Two main opposition groups, the Democratic Alliance and the Congress of the People (the ANC breakaway party formed in 2008) met on Monday to agree a coalition aimed at exploiting the rising disaffection among the ANC's poorer supporters. To many, Zuma is emblematic of the inequality between the black and white rich and the overwhelmingly poor black majority; he has been accused of spending R60m (\u00a34.5m) on renovating his rural homestead.</p> <p>Poorer South Africans continue to despair. The CEO of Lonmin, Marikana's owner, earned R15.8m last year. Rock drill operators, who have one of the most physically demanding jobs in the mines, earn around R10,000 (\u00a3750) a month, and after deductions take home about R4,500. Those with jobs cling on to them, for fear that they may never get one again. There is a pervasive sense of systemic unfairness. And as well as the black elite, they resent the fact that so many whites can prosper based on the social capital, wealth and education obtained during the apartheid years.</p> <p>Combined with this, there appears to be a widespread feeling that political parties and democratic institutions are not responsive. Such frustrations can easily spill over into violent protests.</p> <p>The ANC's unconvincing responses to the massacre expose the fact that the party may not be up to the challenge of steering an anxious country through this crisis. Populists are stepping into the vacuum, using black anger for political gain: these include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/julius-malema\" title=\"\">Julius Malema </a>(the expelled former ANC Youth League president), even though he has richly benefited from his ANC connections.</p> <p>South Africa's rich mineral endowment appears to have helped breed complacency among its ruling class. The thinking among the governing elite appears to be that, if there is real trouble, mineral wealth can always be redistributed. However, the last few days have shaken this idea. If Marikana shocks our leaders out of their complacency, and they genuinely act in the interests of all, rather than looking for scapegoats, then \u2013 as tragic as it has been \u2013 it&#xa0;may prove to be a turning point.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2012. The original said that it is hard to underestimate, rather than overestimate, the impact that scenes once so associated with apartheid will have now they are replayed under a black, democratic government. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Bryn Williams is looking for a new butter. The chef is fussy \u2013 it must be the right consistency, quality and size. And it has to be Welsh. \"I never use Welsh produce just for the sake of it. It must be top-quality, but I take inspiration from food I was brought up&#xa0;on. I used to watch my grandmother churn her own butter and pour buttermilk over crushed new potatoes. Fantastic.\"</p> <p>Williams has long been banging the drum for Welsh food, serving up the finest produce from the valleys at his acclaimed London restaurant <a href=\"http://www.odettesprimrosehill.com/\" title=\"\">Odette's</a>. Now, he has company \u2013 Wales is ready to be noticed, with a government-funded <a href=\"http://www.walesthetruetaste.co.uk/?lang=en\" title=\"\">True Taste of Wales</a> brand and a flurry of gastro-inspired initiatives. True, Wales has always been respected in food circles, chiefly for its renowned <a href=\"http://abergavennyfoodfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Abergavenny food festival</a>, but now there is a concerted effort to put the country firmly on the global food map.</p> <p>A touring kitchen showcasing Welsh food at festivals is going global, with visits to Singapore, Barcelona, Paris, Cologne, Shanghai, Washington and Dubai. Gastro-tourism is growing, with young companies such as <a href=\"http://www.snowdonia-safari.com/\" title=\"\">Snowdonia Safari</a> taking visitors to sample local produce at homegrown businesses \u2013 think stewy cawl and Welsh cakes \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.turnstone-tours.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Turnstone Tours</a> taking tourists to people's houses for home cooking.</p> <p>And it is paying off, with companies reporting increased business. \"One beer company's exports have grown from 5% to 17% in the past three years,\" says Nerys Howell, True Taste food consultant. Wales is also listed as one of the top three destinations for gastro-tourism, according to the journal Rural Geographies. \"People are discovering how good their produce is,\" says Shaun Hill, from Michelin-starred <a href=\"http://www.thewalnuttreeinn.com/\" title=\"\">The Walnut Tree</a>, near Abergavenny. \"We have first-class lamb, good beef, game, cheese and some very good charcuterie such as Trealy Farm's. Wales has always been a poor country so the culture is simple food \u2013 baking, and good meat or fish.\"</p> <p>Ah, the produce, testament to Wales's grassy slopes, mountainous farmland and, as Williams says, the fact that \"it never stops bloody raining\". Speak to most chefs in Wales about the country's produce and their eyes grow dewy. \"The coastline is fabulous,\" says Stephen Terry, from <a href=\"http://www.thehardwick.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Hardwick</a>, Abergavenny. \"Great crab and lobsters, fantastic Welsh samphire, salt-marsh lamb and cheese. Perl wen kicks the ass&#xa0;off brie.\"</p> <p>There is a strong spirit of localism. \"Research shows that 80% of visitors are looking for a Welsh food experience,\" says Howell. Elisabeth Luard, author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781408806463\" title=\"\">A Cook's Year in a Welsh Farmhouse</a>, points out an interesting mix: \"Incomers are keen on green self-sufficiency; locals, who lived isolated lives on the mountains, have a tradition of necessity.\" Most people bake, she says, many own pigs and chickens, and she used to get home-churned butter from her neighbours.</p> <p>So what are chefs rustling up? Terry does a Welsh rarebit made with pressed ham hocks, acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.hafodcheese.co.uk/\">Hafod cheese</a> and Welsh beer (\"there's a brewery in virtually every valley\"), <a href=\"http://www.smoked-foods.co.uk/\">Black Mountains Smokery smoked salmon</a> with laverbread (made from seaweed) and rye bread from nearby award-winning baker <a href=\"http://alexgoochbaker.com/\">Alex Gooch</a>. Back at Odette's, Williams does a light <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/01/nains-bara-brith-recipe\">bara brith</a> (\"speckled bread\"), a Welsh cheeseboard \u2013 perl las, caerphilly and perl wen \u2013 with Welsh buttermilk soda bread and panna cotta. Then there's Welsh black beef, pedigree Welsh pork and mutton \u2013 and, of course, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/01/slow-roasted-shoulder-lamb-recipe\">slow-roasted Welsh lamb</a> (new season and salt marsh).\"They would kill me at home if I didn't!\"</p> <p>For Williams, who has staked his reputation on bigging-up Welsh food, its growing clout is vindication. \"I'm known as a chef who uses Welsh ingredients,\" he says, \"It took years to gain the confidence to stick it on the menu. Welsh food isn't well-known, people found it strange, but Welsh produce can easily compete with [that of] anywhere else in the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>When power starts to shift in the Middle East, its people have long known what to expect. Challenges to authority have rarely been met with a&#xa0;promise of consensus or inclusion. Strong-arm suppression \u2013 the more forceful the better \u2013 has been the default reaction to dissent. The price&#xa0;has usually been brutal.</p> <p>Syrians who wanted an end to regime dominance knew the rules when they started demanding changes in the region's most uncompromising police state in March last year. Now, 18&#xa0;months and more than 23,000 bodies later, and&#xa0;with no end in sight to the chaos ravaging the country, their&#xa0;worst fears are being realised on a&#xa0;scale that continues both to horrify and numb.</p> <p>And yet, the events of the past 18&#xa0;months have shattered one of the abiding guidelines to life under totalitarian rule \u2013 that absolute power is uncontestable. If anything has so far been achieved through the bedlam now rumbling through Syria and indeed other parts of the Arab world, it is a new reality: the power of the street has exposed the fragility of authority.</p> <p>\"I had always said they would fall over when we were no longer scared of them,\" Moustafa Abu Khalil, a retired electricity worker from the northern Syrian town of Jisr al-Shughour, told me in June. \"It took a long time to get to the point where people were prepared to risk everything, their families, their futures, just to bring about change. \"The truth be told, [the people] probably wouldn't have got here if the regime did not continue to escalate the violence every month. That just fed the flames. And now we have a true revolution, civil war, call it what you will. It is a point of no return.\"</p> <p>With all of Syria's cities now under siege, its capital Damascus and commercial hub Aleppo engulfed in violence, Syria seems well past that proverbial point. Defections have whittled down the strength and numbers of the country's vaunted military and destruction and misery is&#xa0;seriously testing the resolve of both&#xa0;regime supporters and those who&#xa0;want Bashar al-Assad gone.</p> <p>The country's economy has been under the anaconda-like grip of international sanctions, which have ground industry to a halt, crippled trade supply lines, battered the currency and shattered confidence. In the hard-hit north, little works any more. War has seen Syrian society, already stuck \u2013 seemingly permanently in 1973&#xa0;\u2013 wound back even further. There are more donkey carts than cars on the streets of some towns between Aleppo and the Turkish border. Clapped-out tractors belch fumes from precious fuel&#xa0;that is sold in&#xa0;two-litre bottles on&#xa0;rubbish-strewn roadsides for around $8 (\u00a35).</p> <p>\"None of us can afford it,\" says Abu Nour, a member of the Free Syrian Army, who, before the Syrian uprising gained momentum, was a tailor whose only military experience was 15 months as a&#xa0;conscript more than a decade ago. \"I'm not sure where the money is coming from to get us to the frontline. Those things a person like me doesn't ask.\"</p> <p>Abu Nour is now a foot soldier in the&#xa0;rebel army that is at the vanguard of the fight for Syria's destiny. Drawn largely from the rural poor, and also represented by conservative Islamic groupings such as the Muslim Brotherhood, the FSA has taken the battle to the country's two lead cities, where it is now engaged in a fight to the death with the regime army.</p> <p>Rebel groups entered Aleppo and Damascus in mid-July and their early gains sparked predictions that four decades of uncompromising rule was about to end. But as a withering summer draws to a close across the northern plains that have harboured Aleppo, and the central plateau on which Damascus, the world's oldest capital has stood for more than 6,000 years, this early optimism has yielded to a more unpalatable reality \u2013 that neither side is&#xa0;about to secure a decisive victory in either city anytime soon.</p> <p>The soaring death toll this week in&#xa0;Damascus, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/syria-worst-massacre-daraya-death-toll-400?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=feed\" title=\"\">where more than 300 people were reportedly killed in one day alone</a>, and the grinding misery in the battlefield suburbs of Aleppo, have left many in Syria \u2013 and in the rest of the ever-more restive region \u2013 wondering what comes next.</p> <p>\"Change of this scale is perilous,\" says Rita Sabbagh, a Damascus businesswoman who supports the regime. \"You must understand that meaningful shifts in thinking and behaviour take generations in this part of the world. Did they really think they would just ride into town like this and the regime would run away?\"</p> <p>Were he to try to cut a deal with Syria's fractious opposition groups or to capitulate to their demands, the downside for Assad and the regime he inherited from his father is obvious. Also increasingly clear, even to lay observers, is the scale of the risk to Syria's neighbours if the civil war continues to expose regional fault lines&#xa0;that have remained unaddressed throughout the modern history of the&#xa0;region.</p> <p>After the 500-year Ottoman empire disintegrated more than 90 years ago, the borders of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and what was to become Israel were defined \u2013 often on imperial whim. The pact between Britain and France that led to Syria's independence, known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, cobbled together various sects under the banner of nation states, which have not coexisted easily.</p> <p>For more than 40 years, the Alawite sect, which is loosely aligned to Shia Islam and had long been persecuted under the Ottomans, has been used to solidify regime control. Most of the key regime figures, including the Assads, have been Alawites ever since Bashar's father, Hafez al-Assad, was at the peak of his powers. Despite comprising around 12% of Syria's population, the Alawites dominate the Syrian establishment and hold most key positions in the military and security apparatus. Now, as&#xa0;Syria wobbles, the sect feels a deep sense of threat from the country's majority Sunnis, some of whom hold grudges against the regime because of&#xa0;its treatment towards them before the uprising.</p> <p>\"Egypt and Libya have taught us that the way that power works [now] in Syria does not have to be the way it will always be,\" said Mohammed Hariri at one of Aleppo's frontline zones earlier this month. A realignment of power appears to be top of the wish list for many fighters and residents alike in Syria's opposition strongholds. But such a shift will not be contained within Syria's borders \u2013 a fact that is causing increasing alarm outside the country and fuelling fears&#xa0;that changes more profound than&#xa0;anything since the fall of the Ottomans are starting to take place in&#xa0;the Middle East.</p> <p>In neighbouring Lebanon, long under the tutelage of Syria to the east and the influence of other players, such as Saudi Arabia, the United States, France and Israel, the tension is palpable. \"I'm afraid that if things are to stay like that, it could lead to the partitioning of Syria and where that will lead the Middle East, don't ask me,\" the leader of Lebanon's Druze sect, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Jumblatt\" title=\"\">Walid Jumblatt</a>, told the Guardian earlier this month. \"Big historical cities will be destroyed. Assad might take refuge in the mountains. Now he is trying to cleanse the Sunnis from Latakia, Benyas, Tartous. It seems the map of Syria is being changed. What is left of the famous Sykes-Picot agreement is being changed.\"</p> <p>Along with Jumblatt, other Lebanese leaders broadly aligned to the west or Saudi Arabia have been lying low this summer. The country's former prime minister, Saad Hariri \u2013 whose father, the Lebanese elder statesman Rafiq Hariri, was assassinated in 2005 \u2013 has been in self-imposed exile in Riyadh and Paris for the past 18 months.</p> <p>Samir Geagea, a political ally of the Hariri, who leads a prominent Christian political bloc, <a href=\"http://www.free-lebanon.net/syria/lf-leader-samir-geagea-escapes-assassination-attempt/\" title=\"\">survived a failed attempt by a sniper to shoot him</a> in his garden in June. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/14/assad-lebanon-damascus-syria\" title=\"\">The arrest earlier this month of Lebanon's former information minister, Michel Samaha</a>, a key ally of Bashar al-Assad, has given weight to the fears that assassins are lurking.</p> <p>Samaha has been charged with receiving explosives and instructions from Syria's national security chief, General Ali Mamlouk, allegedly with the knowledge of Assad, to target 20 key figures in Lebanon. He was entrapped by a close aide who filmed him saying Assad was personally aware&#xa0;of the plans. His case is now before a military tribunal, a rare event in Lebanon, where state institutions have often failed to assert their independence.</p> <p>In Iraq, where assassins have remained a part of the political fabric for much of the past eight years, there is also a growing fear that the chaos in Syria cannot be contained. Islamist groups that wreaked havoc between 2004 and 2007 have announced that they are trying to reclaim ground they lost during fighting with US forces and&#xa0;militias that were at the time backed by the US and Iraqi governments. They claim to be drawing inspiration from the Syrian uprising, which has in part been joined by a new dynamic \u2013 jihadists from other parts of the Arab world, some of whom see the fighting taking place in Syria as part of a global jihad.</p> <p>\"They are trying to make their presence felt again,\" the director general of&#xa0;the intelligence division at Iraq's interior ministry, Major General Ali Hussein Kamal, explained earlier this month. \"They see what is happening in&#xa0;Syria as a chance for them.\"</p> <p>Sitting in his fortified office in a riverside Baghdad suburb, Kamal claimed that Syria's insistence that the&#xa0;uprising against it is a foreign-led plot using jihadists was at odds with Iraq's recent dealings with Syria. \"In&#xa0;2009, the bombs that targeted the ministries could clearly be traced back to Syria,\" he said. \"Both in planning and instruction.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he believed that regime figures had known of the bombing campaign, in which huge bombs targeted the finance, foreign and justice ministries, as well as the Baghdad governor's offices, killing more than 200 people, Kamal said: \"I refer you to&#xa0;the comments of the defected Syrian&#xa0;ambassador to Iraq who said the&#xa0;regime had close links to al-Qaida and had links to the recent bombings in&#xa0;Damascus.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395465184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/29/1346257793617/A-man-reacts-after-an-air-010.jpg\" alt=\"A man reacts after an airstrike on Azaz, 15 August 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man reacts after an airstrike on Azaz destroyed 10 buildings on 15 August 2012. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Aleppo has burned, the regime counter-assault in Damascus has been relentless over the past fortnight. The Syrian army has warned of \"inevitable death\" for rebel fighters who don't put down their weapons in areas known as opposition strongholds. Anti-regime neighbourhoods say they have little reason to trust that pledges of amnesties will be honoured by a military that has shown no quarter in more than a year of&#xa0;battles with rebels. And, as sectarian positions harden, in an increasingly volatile region, there appears little reason for the regime to decide that now would be a time for compromise.</p> <p>Iran, which has viewed Syria as its key&#xa0;ally in the Arab world for much of the past 30 years, has shown signs of increasing belligerence as the situation in&#xa0;Syria has deteriorated. The fall of Damascus would be a serious strategic blow for Tehran, as it would for its key ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, which has enjoyed staunch support and patronage from both regimes since 1982.</p> <p>Also unflinchingly in Syria's corner is&#xa0;Russia, which has acted to prevent even more severe international sanctions or any move towards direct foreign intervention in the conflict. Russia's ties&#xa0;to the Syrian regime date back to Soviet days and have, in many ways, post-dated them. Libya and Egypt had at&#xa0;times been in the Soviet sphere. Syria, meanwhile, has barely left it despite the&#xa0;end of the cold war more than 20&#xa0;years ago.</p> <p>Late last month, in a grand villa&#xa0;in the Aleppo hinterland that belongs to the family of General Hikmat Shehabi, a former confidante of Hafez al-Assad who left Syria shortly after his son was named president, rebels thumbed through old books on a lounge room shelf. One had been signed by the late North Korean dictator, Kim Jung-il. There were also tomes in tribute to Assad Sr and eulogies to the achievements of Soviet society. Time had stood still in the dusty marble mansion, just as&#xa0;it had on the drab empty streets outside where this society in the north&#xa0;of&#xa0;a country deeply embroiled in revolution seemed collectively unsure about what to do next.</p> <p>\"Nobody has come to help us,\" said&#xa0;Khalid Ibrahim, a steel worker who joined the rebel army when dwindling business closed his workshop earlier this&#xa0;year. A Russian-made Mig fighter jet circled nearby as Ibrahim pressed his point. \"We knew what we were up against when we took this on, but in Libya the Americans were there within a&#xa0;month. France and Britain were fighting each other to be the first to bomb Gaddafi. And Assad is worse, much, much worse.\" He shook his head, then added: \"This could be a disaster, or a new map. Only God knows which way it will go.\"</p> <p>In dozens of conversations the Guardian has had with Syrians in recent months \u2013 some diehard regime backers and others just as deeply committed to the opposition cause \u2013 a&#xa0;clear sense has emerged that the popular uprising that started it all in the southern city of Deraa has been dwarfed by something far more significant.</p> <p>The arc of revolution that started in&#xa0;Tunisia, surged through Egypt, then&#xa0;raged through Libya, has hit an obstacle in Syria, one that may prove difficult as a whole for the region to bypass. \"History has hijacked what the people were trying to achieve,\" says Amal Kuzbari, a Syrian teacher from Homs, now a refugee in southern Turkey. \"It&#xa0;was simple at the beginning and it&#xa0;isn't now.</p> <p>The fight for Syria has become a struggle for the destiny of the region. It&#xa0;is also now a clash of ideologies and orders, of sects and societies. The battle for regional influence runs straight through Damascus and none of&#xa0;the region's main players are willing to yield ground. \"It's Sunni versus Shia, Arab versus Persian, America versus Russia, the list goes on,\" says a western diplomat. \"This is unfinished business on many levels.\"</p> <p>What will emerge from Syria's civil war will likely take many months to determine. A rapid end to the regime would not mean an end to crisis. The vacuum that would follow the end of strongman rule would take some filling \u2013 the recent experience of Iraq to the east, another sectarian state bound together by an autocrat, clearly demonstrates that.</p> <p>Even states such as Turkey, with strong borders and robust institutions, will remain susceptible to Syria's spillover effects. Turkey is now hosting around 40,000 Syrian refugees and said earlier this year that it has prepared contingencies for up to 500,000. However, if Syria's Kurds decide that the crumbling of state authority gives them the chance to push their case for statehood, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/29/us-syria-crisis-refugees-turkey-idUSBRE87S08020120829\" title=\"\">Turkey will be facing more than a refugee crisis</a>.</p> <p>\"Changing how power works [in the&#xa0;region] is a good thing,\" explains a&#xa0;Syrian exile in Beirut, who claims to support neither side. \"But I'm not sure people know exactly what it is they have started.\"</p>",

Winfrey, at 58, has never looked more beautiful.</p> <p>Yet, even for a woman who has championed both black and feminist causes \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120603/\" title=\"\">embodied Toni Morrison characters</a> \u2013 this is clearly A Big Deal, requiring editorial explanation. The daytime diva reveals that she likes feeling \"unencumbered\" with natural hair: \"But it's hard to manage daily \u2026 in order for me not to look, as Gayle says, 'like you put your finger in a light socket'.\" Gayle is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_King\" title=\"\">Gayle King</a>, a woman who appears similarly wedded to her straighteners.</p> <p>One is uncomfortably reminded of postcolonial theorist Frantz Fanon's arguments in his seminal 1952 study <a href=\"http://platypus1917.org/2010/03/15/book-review-frantz-fanon-black-skin-white-masks/\" title=\"\">Black Skin, White Masks</a>, where black upward mobility is expressed via stringent, self-policing white imitation. Toni Morrison's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bluest_Eye\" title=\"\">The Bluest Eye (1970)</a> also comes to mind, in which self-loathing Pecola Breedlove prays each night for whiteness. Meanwhile, its narrator, Claudia MacTeer, is presented with a succession of \"blue-eyed, yellow-haired, pink-skinned\" baby dolls: \"'Here,' they said, 'this is beautiful, and if you are on this day \"worthy\" you may have it'.\"</p> <p>I bow to no one in my love of lipstick, powder and paint, and the jubilant creativity in their wielding. Ornamentation rituals are a defining feature of human society: first we get food and fire sorted, then we daub cave walls and&#xa0;ourselves. However, in too many parts of the world \"because you're worth it\" translates as Morrison's \"'this is beautiful, and if you are on this day \"worthy\" you may have it'\".</p> <p>In India, an estimated 40% of the nation uses face whiteners, since pallor&#xa0;\u2013&#xa0;like straightened black hair in&#xa0;America \u2013 is considered both professionally and sexually desirable. This year, its citizens are expected to spend half a billion dollars on such products, up 15% from 2011. Companies such as Unilever, L'Or\u00e9al and Garnier are reaping vast profits using Bollywood stars as role models. Yet, where 700 million Indians are living on less than $2 a day, perilous, unbranded chemical options are rife.</p> <p>In China, similarly racial, indeed racist, reinventions abound, most obviously in the realm of plastic surgery. Chinese surgeons undertake 13% of global procedures, generating some 20,000 complaints about disfigurement a year. Typical interventions include eyelid modification to create an upper-lid crease, rhinoplasty to raise the nose, cheek implants and even sole implants in the feet to make patients taller.</p> <p>Evidence also issues from traditionally wealthy nations. In Japan, breast enlargements are deployed to create a western \"bon-kyu-bon\" (\"big-small-big\", or hourglass) figure. In New York, where a century ago Jews were having nose jobs and the Irish ear-pinning to assimilate, Asians and Latinos are queuing up at surgeries in immigrant neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Only in Britain, it seems, do surgeons balk at such metamorphoses. At a meeting last year of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, preserving ethnicity was a central theme. This was manifested, most minutely, in a cross-racial study of \"What makes the perfect belly button?\", concluding that surgeons need to be aware of the nuances of racial preferences for a vertical or round \"innie\". Still, better navel-gazing than eyelid-slicing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beauty_Myth\" title=\"\">Naomi Wolf's Beauty Myth</a> of 1991 posited the thesis that the beauty industry promulgates a cultural, economic and ideological scam. However, it is no less than an empire: a form of stealth imperialism in which self-harm is weapon-in-chief. Perhaps, in time, as China and India consolidate their positions as the new global superpowers, the west will learn to crave eastern pulchritude, ridding itself of blondness and blue eyes accordingly.</p> <p>Last week brought another outing for the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2194176/Dark-Lady-Shakespeares-sonnets-finally-revealed-London-prostitute-called-Lucy-Negro.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">theory that Shakespeare's \"Dark Lady\" may have been one Lucy Negro</a>, a black Clerkenwell madam. In fact, in the sonnets of 1609, Shakespeare is arguing for colour-blind beauty against the classical and Renaissance norms that our culture has inherited. His mistress's eyes are nothing like the sun, her lips do not resemble coral, her skin is dun, with none of the \"roses and lilies\" loveliness found in the tradition of emblazoning beauty. She is no goddess. Her feet are firmly planted. She is her own self and beautiful for it. It is a statement that has, alas, lost none of its radicalism.</p>",
  "<p>A $15bn (\u00a39.4bn) flagship energy project in the Russian Arctic promoted by Vladimir Putin and state-owned Gazprom has been sunk by soaring costs, falling European demand and cheap shale gas in America.</p> <p>The ambitious Shtokman gas production scheme in the Barent Sea, described by the Russian president as recently as May as having \"global significance\", was officially killed off on Wednesday.</p> <p>Greenpeace celebrated the end of the controversial scheme in pristine waters, but a top British energy commentator warned last night that it could lead to higher prices for British consumers.</p> <p>The decision on Shtokman was given abruptly by Gazprom. \"All parties have come to the conclusion that financing is too high to be able to do it for the time being,\" said Vsevolod Cherepanov, head of the company's production department.</p> <p>The move became more likely last week when Gazprom's Norwegian partner Statoil handed back its 24% stake and wrote off $336m (\u00a3212m) saying Shtokman could not be commercially justified.</p> <p>Gazprom says it is still talking to Shell and other foreign investors about taking over the Statoil stake.</p> <p>Oil and gas exploration in the far north is highly controversial given the pristine environment and Greenpeace took its first direct action against a Gazprom platform last week by boarding a floating platform in the Arctic.</p> <p>Ben Ayliffe, senior polar campaigner at the green group, said the scrapping of the Shtokman sent a clear warning to investors that the Arctic was not \"the land of milk and honey\" the oil and gas industry claimed.</p> <p>\"The likes of Cairn, Shell and Gazprom have spent billions in the Arctic but come out with nothing to show for it, and we shouldn't be surprised. The technical challenges and costs of operating in such extreme conditions mean that hydrocarbon development in the far north represents a huge risk.\"</p> <p>But Paul Stevens, an energy expert at international affairs think tank, Chatham House, said the Shtokman move should not be celebrated. \"Usually decisions of this scale are taken for many reasons but I worry that expectations of a shale revolution in Europe is undermining investment decisions. It is OK if Europe is soon awash with cheap shale supplies but if it turns out to be all hype and not reality then it could be too late to invest in alternative projects that have long lead times. That would have implications for [gas] prices,\" he explained.</p> <p>The decision to indefinitely postpone the Shtokman project represents a significant blow to the Kremlin's economic \u2013 and possibly political \u2013 strategy.</p> <p>Russia has often been accused by its critics of using energy as a foreign policy tool and it no doubt believed that becoming a significant provider of gas to the US would give it political leverage.</p> <p>Shtokman, named after the geologist who discovered it, is one of the world's largest gas fields but has been the subject of endless political and commercial wrangling since it was discovered almost quarter of a century ago.</p> <p>With reserves estimated at 3.8 trillion cubic metres it was considered a major opportunity as gas prices began to soar worldwide in the early part of the new century.</p> <p>But hopes of developing it to transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the fast-expanding American market have been drastically undermined by the North American shale gas \"revolution\" which has seen prices fall from above $10 (\u00a36) per million British thermal units to the current level below $3.</p> <p>At the same time economic turmoil in Europe plus a series of new discoveries in Norway has considerably reduced demand for Russian gas.</p> <p>Gazprom insisted on Wednesday that it was still possible that Shtokman could still see the light of day pointing out that Total of France remained a stakeholder. Cherepanov said: \"We are collecting new data ... We have extensive gas resources. We shouldn't take hasty decisions.\"</p>",
  "<p>In August 2007 I travelled to northern Alberta in Canada, to photograph the mining of oil sands. The owner of this mine, <a href=\"http://www.syncrude.ca/users/folder.asp?FolderID=5617\" title=\"\">Syncrude</a>, is one of the largest and oldest of the oil sands companies, producing more than 350,000 barrels a&nbsp;day. Oil sands release three times <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/23/eu-tar-sands-pollution-vote\" title=\"\">more greenhouse gases than conventional oil sources</a>, and the extraction process has turned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2010/sep/07/tarnished-earth-oil-sands\" title=\"\">vast swaths of boreal forest into a desert-like landscape</a>, pockmarked by toxic lakes. I wanted to show how desperate things have become that we are using this oil, as well as capture some sense of the beauty left in these destroyed landscapes.</p> <p>The forest in the foreground was planted in&nbsp;the 1980s as part of <a href=\"http://www.earthmagazine.org/article/reclaiming-albertas-oil-sands-mines\" title=\"\">a reclamation process</a>, to see if the landscape could be returned to its original state. Syncrude are proud of what they have achieved, but this forest only makes up 1 sq km of the 686 sq km of&nbsp;land disturbed so far. They chose the&nbsp;easiest land to plant on, but they are still a long way from recreating the&nbsp;complex ecosystem that once existed there.</p> <p>It was difficult to depict how vast the scale of destruction is. I knew that those who had already documented it had gone up in the air, but that wasn't open to me because of the cost. The terrain is mostly flat, and I&nbsp;spent&nbsp;a large amount of&nbsp;time working out how I&nbsp;could capture it&nbsp;from the ground.</p> <p>I shot on large format film to get&nbsp;details and tones&nbsp;that I knew I&nbsp;couldn't capture on&nbsp;my digital camera. I&nbsp;also like the tension of&nbsp;using film, that sense of not knowing if you've got it. When I&nbsp;showed up at slightly sensitive locations, it could have set off alarm bells if I had looked like an obvious photojournalist. When you are standing there with a cloak over your head, you look like a geek and can get away with it.</p> <p>The day I got this shot I was feeling&nbsp;stressed because I had just heard that <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL53580A\" title=\"\">Jonas Bendiksen</a>, a Magnum&nbsp;photographer who had been to Alberta a few months previously, was about to publish his images \u2013 and&nbsp;I&nbsp;imagined he had gone up in a helicopter.

Assad laughed off claims that he had fled the capital, or escaped abroad, telling his interviewer: \"I'm here with you in Damascus inside the republican palace.\"</p> <p>The president also praised his country's embattled armed forces. Opposition activists and human rights groups accuse Assad's troops and pro-government shabiha militias of staging a series of massacres, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/syria-worst-massacre-daraya-death-toll-400?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">most recently in the town of Daraya</a>. Up to 400 people were reportedly killed there over the weekend. \"The army are doing their job. They are performing heroic acts in every sense of the word,\" Assad said.</p> <p>Assad also suggested outside diplomatic pressure to end the conflict made little difference, and said he did not think a no-fly zone over Syria would ever happen. \"The truth is that Syria doesn't need a green light when dealing with its internal affairs, neither from our allies or our enemies,\" he told the channel, owned by his cousin Rami Makhlouf, one of Syria's wealthiest men.</p> <p>Assad's remarks, showing him to be relaxed and calm, came as his new prime minister, Wael Nader al-Halqi, arrived in Tehran for a two-day summit. Iran, Assad's principal regional backer, proposed a three-month ceasefire inside Syria. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, also attended the non-aligned summit, with Egypt's new president, Mohamed Morsi, due to drop in on Thursday.</p> <p>But the Iranian initiative has little prospect of success and came amid another day of carnage across Syria. Residents in Ghouta, three miles (5km) east of Damascus, said they had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/29/syria-crisis-live\" title=\"\">under bombardment from government tanks and warplanes for two days</a>. \"A lot of people are fleeing Ghouta to escape the random shooting, but they don't know where to go,\" one resident, Abu Omer, told the Guardian via Skype.</p> <p>Omer said the regime had punished the area \u2013 home to two million people \u2013 after fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) shot down a warplane. He said the Syrian army was now converging in nearby Ain Terma and al-Miliha, and was attempting to storm the town. \"There are conveys of tanks and armoured vehicles full of soldiers on the highway that divides Damascus and eastern Ghouta. The snipers are shooting anyone in sight,\" he said. The regime had forced local bakeries to close, with food and medicines now in short supply, and was shooting civilians sheltering in their houses. The victims included two children in Juber aged seven and eight, and three women, he said.</p> <p>Omer's claims are impossible to verify. But <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C53MhZVkls&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">video footage</a> posted on YouTube on Wednesday appears to show heavy bombardment of Ghouta, with residential buildings targeted next to a minaret and smoke billowing across the skyline. More than 40 people have been killed by pro-regime militias in outlying areas, activists said.</p> <p>In northern Syria, an armed Islamist rebel group claimed it had carried out a major attack on the Taftanaz airbase near the town of Idlib. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNgDy9XzsWQ&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">At least five helicopters were destroyed</a>, it said, with the rebels assaulting the airbase using tanks captured from a Syrian military checkpoint and rocket-propelled grenades.</p> <p>\"The operation lasted for 40 minutes,\" one rebel commander, Tamiem al-Shami, told the Guardian via Skype. \"We were able to take out most of the defences at the base. We used a lot of fire against the helicopters and could see with our own eyes how the helicopters were burning.\" Shami said he was a member of the Ahrar al-Sham brigade in Idlib, an Islamic religious unit which was separate from the FSA but co-operated with it.</p> <p>Shami said three of his men were killed during the operation and one injured. The rebels withdrew when Syrian warplanes attacked their positions, he added. The Syrian state news agency Sana said forces loyal to the government had successfully repulsed the assault.</p> <p>Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, meanwhile, said he would press the UN security council to set up a safe haven inside Syria to protect thousands of people fleeing the violence.</p> <p>Turkey has long been floating the idea of a no-fly zone, or buffer zone, to protect displaced Syrians from attacks by Assad's forces, but the issue has become more pressing now the number of refugees in Turkey has exceeded 80,000 \u2013 a number it says approaches its limits. \"We expect the UN to step in and protect the refugees inside Syria, and if possible, to shelter them in camps there,\" Davutoglu told reporters before leaving for New York to attend Thursday's high-level UN security council meeting on Syria.</p>",
  "<p>A young man in white overalls and a face mask stands in front of a black filing cabinet. He holds a&#xa0;white, wooden architectural model like a waiter's tray. He is surrounded by a dozen other young people, similarly attired. We are&#xa0;in the middle of the Arsenale, the main&#xa0;exhibition space of <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/Home.html\" title=\"\">Venice's Architecture Biennale</a>. Amid a panoply of highly sophisticated presentations from the world's top architects, here the exercise is reduced to its essentials: a man holding a model.</p> <p>Except it's not that simple. The young man is Elliott Trujillo, an architecture student at the University of Madrid, and he didn't design the building he holds \u2013 a model for an archaeological museum in Cordoba. The museum was designed instead by <a href=\"http://www.nietosobejano.com/\" title=\"\">Nieto Sobejano</a>, an established Spanish practice. Nieto Sobejano and four other Spanish practices have chosen to spend their Biennale budget on flying out architecture students to present their work for them, and to directly engage with visitors. Trujillo doesn't expect to design anything himself for a long time. No young Spanish architect does. \"There are two realities when it comes to architecture,\" he says. \"One is our situation in Spain, where there is no work and no future. And the other is the world of amazing architecture we see here: Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Norman Foster.\"</p> <p>The theme for this year's Biennale, chosen by its British director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/feb/03/david-chipperfield\" title=\"\">David Chipperfield</a>, is Common Ground. It's a choice that hints at architecture's need to refocus on issues like engagement and communication, on its need to establish shared values. But as the Spanish students show, there are chasms splitting the world of architecture. A divide is opening up \u2013 generationally, economically and philosophically. The starchitects of Trujillo's second reality are still here, but the appetite for celebrations of individual genius, and isolated, beautifully crafted buildings, seems to be dissipating. To co-opt the language of the Occupy movement, the big names are starting to look like architecture's 1%.</p> <p>Zaha Hadid's installation in the Arsenale explores the relationship between her own computer-driven geometries and those of 20th century structural pioneers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/oct/04/architecture\" title=\"\">Frei Otto</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.buildllc.com/2009/04/heinz-isler-a-few-important-things/\" title=\"\">Heinz Isler</a>. The space is dominated by a sprouting tower, made of thin, pleated aluminium. But go into the neighbouring room and you are literally down to earth, among hand-thrown clay pots, stones, bricks and red soil: a life-size replica of a south-Indian house, designed by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sidnid/4202183967/\" title=\"\">Anupama Kundoo</a>. She has brought local craftsmen and builders with her, many of whom have never left India before. While Hadid has been expanding her structural vocabulary next door, an Indian builder tells me he has learned something more elemental from his Venice visit: \"On building sites in India, we don't wear shoes, safety glasses or protective clothing.\"</p> <p>The Biennale can be overwhelming. The Arsenale exhibition stretches through what must be a couple of kilometres of atmospheric former naval buildings. Then there are the nearby Giardini, a second exhibition space at the centre of a park studded with permanent national pavilions, each with its own exhibition. It would take the entire three-month duration of the Biennale to see it all properly: room after room packed with architectural models, texts, videos and displays, punctuated by the occasional large-scale gesture. (Exhibitors have often made a trade-off between detailed research and immediate impact.)</p> <p>There are some surprises. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/29/norman-foster-interview\" title=\"\">Norman Foster</a> has brought a very unFosterish installation, which again touches on architecture's divisions. The floor is traversed by digital flows of eminent architectural names, while the walls are covered with rapid-fire montages of global strife, courtesy of film-maker <a href=\"http://www.carloscarcas.com/\" title=\"\">Carlos Carcas</a>: street protests, Latin American slums, natural disasters, dispossessed people, all against a discordant soundtrack of crashes and shouts. Elsewhere, London-based <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/22/farshid-moussavi-architect-city-living\" title=\"\">Farshid Moussavi</a> offers a refreshing sorbet of a room: four walls of ever-changing projections of architectural facades and structures, rendered in simple black-line drawings.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://fashionarchitecturetaste.com/\" title=\"\">FAT</a>'s Museum of Copying gets the balance just right, mischievously highlighting the way architects borrow from each other. The British practice's space is dominated by an arch formed from two portions of a scale model of Palladio's <a href=\"http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Villa_Capra.html\" title=\"\">Villa Rotunda</a>. On the walls around it are further examples of originals and their doppelgangers: a Villa Rotunda in the Palestinian territories, a St Peter's Basilica in the Ivory Coast. Meanwhile, invited architects have assembled their own dossiers of copying in all its forms. There is a photocopier and a pile of paper next to this, an encouragement to make further copies.</p> <p>The general mood is one of turning to the past rather than forging ahead \u2013 perhaps inevitable, given that the event is still dominated by Europe. China's presence is marginal. Africa, south Asia and the Middle East are barely here.</p> <p>As Europe struggles to see a way through the economic gloom, it's no wonder the mid-20th century looks so appealing. The British pavilion <a href=\"http://www.venicetakeaway.com/\" title=\"\">has invited architects</a> to exhibit projects from across the world featuring \"ideas to change British architecture\". It's an approach that's both self-effacing in its non-promotion of British architecture (amply represented elsewhere) and yet self-absorbed in its preoccupation with domestic issues. Many other pavilions explore similar themes of reuse, downsizing and introspection: the US <a href=\"http://labiennale.us/\" title=\"\">offers hundreds of small-scale, eco-minded interventions</a>; Japan focuses on humanitarian housing post-tsunami, and again questions the cult&#xa0;of the starchitect. (\"Are not most 'architectural statements' merely egotistical gestures on the part of the architect?\" asks the pavilion's director, <a href=\"http://www.toyo-ito.co.jp/WWW/index/index_en.html\" title=\"\">Toyo Ito</a>. \"Why and for whom are architects making architecture?\")</p> <p>In this context, the social utopianism of the mid-20th century is&#xa0;seen with something approaching nostalgia. Those were the days: when architects knew what needed to be done and governments had the money to let them do it. Dutch superstars <a href=\"http://oma.eu/\" title=\"\">OMA</a>, for example, celebrate the work of anonymous architects in public authorities across Europe from the 1960s and 70s. As OMA architect <a href=\"http://oma.eu/partners\" title=\"\">Reinier de Graaf</a> puts it, the era was \"a&#xa0;short-lived, fragile period of naive optimism \u2013 before the brutal rule of the market economy became the common denominator\".</p> <p>In Greece's pavilion <a href=\"http://www.archdaily.com/266398/venice-biennale-2012-greek-pavilion/\" title=\"\">there is similar nostalgia for the \"Polykatoikia\"</a>, the social housing that evolved in Athens in the 1950s. Set into the sides and tops of the displays are tiny models of individual apartments, with an accompanying photograph and basic information. The most inexplicably moving thing I saw in Venice was one such slide, of the bedroom of an Albanian immigrant couple and their two-year-old daughter: a double bed and a cot crammed into a tiny, bare room.</p> <p>But it is by no means all doom and gloom. There are moments of sheer delight and amazement here, even in the midst of poverty. <a href=\"http://torredavid.tumblr.com/\">Urban-Think Tank</a> and Guardian design columnist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/series/justin-mcguirk-design\" title=\"\">Justin McGuirk</a> have together created <a href=\"http://www.u-tt.com/researchExhibitions_2008VeniceBiennale.html\" title=\"\">a&#xa0;working mock-up of a Venezuelan restaurant</a>. As intended, it has become a lively gathering place, with eating, drinking, music and even dancing. Around the walls are photographs of an&#xa0;abandoned 45-storey officer in Caracas, which has been squatted by some 750 families. This is not a saga about poverty but a celebration of improvised resourcefulness.</p> <p>Brazil's pavilion, meanwhile, takes the relaxed stance of an emerging economy. On one side it features a wall&#xa0;of peep-holes, through which observers can spy on the occupants of a luxury S\u00e3o Paolo villa, watching their lives unfold like a hilarious telenovela. On the other side of the room, there are a series of hammocks to lie in and&#xa0;acoustic guitars to strum. The installation features a priceless quote from L\u00facio Costa, planner of <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445/gallery/\" title=\"\">Bras\u00edlia</a>: \"The same people who rest in hammocks can, whenever necessary, build a new capital in three years' time.\" And he did just that. It makes the rest of the world look uptight.</p> <p>A final highlight was the Russian pavilion, a refreshing blast of op-art bordering on vulgarity that is out of step with the overriding themes, but nevertheless sticks in the memory. Three rooms \u2013 two cube-shaped, one circular and domed \u2013 are tiled on every surface in a giant, flashing mosaic of barcodes. Visitors are given a tablet when they enter, which they can point at any particular QR code. These all translate into information on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolkovo_innovation_center\" title=\"\">Skolkovo</a> \u2013 an ambitious project to create a Silicon Valley-style science city outside Moscow. Sure enough, Skolkovo's designers include a roster of familiar names: Herzog &amp; de Meuron, OMA, Kazuyo Sejima and David Chipperfield. While Europe and America are soul-searching and dialling it down, Russia seems to be saying: \"Forget the theory. Look at us. We're going to build something big.\"</p> <p>Should Trujillo and those disaffected students go to Russia? One hopes not. There are other ideas to inspire them here, and bigger problems for architecture to tackle. The ground is not common, but&#xa0;it is definitely shifting.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://labiennale.org/it/Home.html\" title=\"\">Venice Architecture Biennale</a> runs until 25 November. For more coverage, see the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/venice-biennale\" title=\"\">Biennale coverage</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012.

  "<p><a href=\"http://marcfaberblog.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Marc Faber</a>, the Swiss investor and ultra bear, says there have been four mega bubbles in the past 40 years. In the 1970s it was gold; in the 1980s it was the Nikkei, and in the 1990s it was the Nasdaq. Bigger than all of them, though, has been the iron ore bubble, a tenfold increase in prices in less than a decade.</p> <p>Iron ore is the raw material for steel, production of which has rocketed as a result of China's economic boom. Consider the following facts. In the past 15 years, China has built 90 million new homes \u2013 enough to house the populations of the UK, France and Germany combined. A quarter of global steel demand is for Chinese property and Chinese infrastructure.</p> <p>Commodity-rich countries, like Australia, have never had it so good. China takes 25% of Australia's exports and iron ore accounts for 60% of all the goods Australia sells to China. One reason Australia avoided recession during the global downturn of 2008-09 was that it had a well-run banking system. A much bigger reason was that the country had become a giant pit from which China could extract the minerals it needed for its industrial expansion. Money flooded into the country from sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds looking for AAA investments. The Australian dollar has soared, as have property prices.</p> <p>China's economy is now slowing, and although the economic data is not particularly reliable, it seems to be slowing fast. The country has two million unsold homes, with another 30 million under construction. There is a glut of iron ore and the price is falling. Where does that leave Australia? Horribly exposed, quite obviously. It has an over-valued currency, an over-valued property market, and its major customer is now desperately pulling every available policy lever in the hope of avoiding a hard landing. Whatever happens, the Australian dollar is a sell. Just how big a sell will depend on how successful Beijing is in reflating the Chinese economy.</p>",

Yes, I know it's a stupid question: of course it's the photo on top - the iconic picture of <a href=\"http://apple.copydesk.org/2012/08/25/keep-in-mind-as-you-put-together-your-neil-armstrong-packages-tonight/\">Buzz Aldrin</a>'s footprint on the moon that was just making the rounds on the internet via various channels following Neil Armstrong's death last week.</p> <p>The second picture was taken at 4050 m depth on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_Abyssal_Plain\">Porcupine Abyssal Plain</a>, off the Irish continental margin. It remains a mystery to this day what created this pattern in the deep-sea sediment - the best bet is probably that it is the feeding pattern of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteropneust\">enteropneust</a> (Acorn worm) which might be buried below the surface and coming up to feed. But, to my knowledge, nobody has any footage of this actually happening. If you are interested, I wrote about this photo \u2013 briefly \u2013 <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/stuffysour/2010/02/21/of_fairy_rings_and_other_mysteries/\">a while ago</a>.</p> <p>For the last few days, I've been intrigued by the thought that, although we \u2013 humans \u2013 have only been to the moon a few times, this image of the footprint is so significant that it is probably known to a very large proportion of the human population, if not the majority. At the same time, images of deep-sea mysteries can stay within a relatively small and exclusive circle for a long time. Or, looking at it another way: there's a human footprint on the moon while who knows what kind of weird, unknown and never-observed creatures hang out in the mud on the deep-sea floor of our very own planet.</p> <p>The saying that \"we know more about the surface of the moon than the deep sea\" is quoted so often by deep-sea biologists and those reporting on deep-sea findings that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. To be honest, I am actually not sure that it is even true, not having looked much into what data we have on the surface of the moon \u2013 and, if we're just talking \"surface\", mapping of the deep-sea floor has of course been making steady progress over the last few decades and the maps are getting <a href=\"http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/multibeam.html\">pretty good</a>. But it is still true that much of the deep-sea floor remains unstudied concerning anything that matters, and also that big discoveries there have reliably been truly big, unexpected and exciting: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent\">hydrothermal vents</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_seep\">cold seeps</a> anyone?</p> <p>However, we now seem to have firmly entered into an era of moving beyond considerations of what's technically possible when it comes to our planet, our home, and going into action mode. Climate change needs to be addressed \u2013 and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions seems almost to be pushed to the back seat when it comes to options. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/graphic/2012/jul/17/geoengineering-world-map\">Geoengineering</a> has been discussed seriously for a while now, with some ideas such as iron fertilisation seemingly refusing to go away \u2013 which, if it worked, would affect the deep sea without anyone ever actually having looked seriously into what effects this might have on that environment. </p> <p>Then there is the increasing scarcity of resources, including metals such as gold and copper. Can we think of any other place that we have not started mining yet? Oh yes \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the deep sea! The situation is now such that a hiatus on the extraction of these metals from the deep-sea floor that lasted several decades seems to have ended, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/06/papua-new-guinea-deep-sea-mining\">recently described</a> in this very news outlet.</p> <p>And why not, you might say: deep-sea trawling, the increasing fisheries pressure on the Antarctic, or deep-sea oil drilling, to name a few random things, may be a much greater cause for concern. You may even be right. But before we start a whole new, big thing, we may first of all want to stop and consider the imprints we're leaving on this planet, and start taking an active interest in what's going on in these new exploitable areas, no matter how unseen or remote.</p>",
  "<p>A struggling German solar business has been bought by a South Korean firm as the appetite of Asian companies for their western rivals shows no sign of letting up.</p> <p>Creditors of Q-Cells agreed on Wednesday to hand over ownership to Hanwha of South Korea with the loss of a further 200 jobs. One of its local German rivals, Solon, which was also in severe financial difficulties, was bought earlier this year by Indian firm Microsol.</p> <p>European renewable energy companies have fallen on hard times due to the credit crunch, low-cost far east competition and increasing political uncertainty about subsidy levels in the west.</p> <p>Vestas, the world's largest wind turbine maker, which is headquartered in Denmark, admitted earlier this week that it was in talks about a strategic partnership with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.</p> <p>Last week the chairman of Vestas, which has sacked large parts of its board and management team, said he was looking at selling off a 20% stake in the wind supply group to an outside investor. Vestas has recently completed the sale of its wind turbine tower factory at Varde in Denmark to China's, Titan Wind Energy.</p> <p>The Q-Cells sale still needs the agreement of the European competition authorities but industry experts said they did not expect opposition for the takeover, which should preserve a solar cell and solar module research base at Bitterfeld-Wolfen plus its administration site in Berlin. The latter location will bear the brunt of the redundancies.</p> <p>Insolvency administrator Henning Schorisch said he regretted the job losses but added: \"I am very happy that Q-Cells has found a strong partner in Hanwha, who has the necessary means to provide company, brand and staff with long-term perspectives again.\"</p> <p>Hanwha, one of the largest South Korean corporations with sales of $31.6bn (\u00a319.9bn) in 2011, said it planned to use the takeover of Q-Cells to expand its position as one of the leading players in the global photovoltaic industry.</p> <p>Q-Cells filed for insolvency in April of this year after months of desperately trying to restructure the business. Q-Cells was one of the world's largest makers of photovoltaic cells but had been hit by severe competition from cheaper Chinese manufacturers plus a series of cuts in German solar power subsidies.</p> <p>Fellow equipment maker Solon and Solar Millennium filed for creditor protection as did Solarhybrid, a company that built solar power arrays. Britain has produced relatively few substantial renewable energy companies within the wind sector The UK charge into renewables has been largely reliant on foreign suppliers such as Vestas, Siemens of Germany and Gamesa of Spain. Many of the wind farm developers in Britain \u2013 big utilities \u2013 are owned abroad with the exception of Centrica and SSE.</p>",
  "<p>The slowdown in the Chinese economy has claimed more victims, with Chilean copper miner Antofagasta reporting a fall in first half profits and local iron and steel maker Baoshan expecting a \"most difficult\" third quarter.</p> <p>Copper prices have plunged by more than 25% over the last 18 months as demand shrinks in the face of uncertainty over future levels of growth in China and the wider global economy.</p> <p>Pre-tax profits at Antofagasta, which is listed on the London stock market, fell more than 7% in the first six months of the year to $1.56bn (\u00a31.04bn) - lower than many City analysts had expected.</p> <p>Shares in the business fell nearly 1% to \u00a311.23 despite the fact that its new chief executive, Diego Hern\u00e1ndez, talked up the \"great potential\" of its current operations and a \"strong pipeline\" of new projects.</p> <p>Baoshan, also known as Baosteel, saw first half profits crash 53% to $374m and said the third quarter was going to be even worse than the previous two.</p>",
  "<p>I've just finished my final preparations in Portugal and I'm both excited and relieved that the waiting for the Games is over. We've all worked so hard and I'm certain that the performances we'll see over the next week or so from all of the athletes will be fantastic.</p> <p>But I'm hoping that the London Paralympics will deliver more than just sporting success. My dream is that these will be the breakthrough Games. When we can dispel so many myths and misapprehensions that people may have about disability.</p> <p>The number one myth I come up against all the time is that we can't do something. For me, there's no bigger incentive than that to prove people wrong. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/23/ben-rushgrove-paralympics-family\" title=\"\">My philosophy is never to think what I can't do \u2013 only what I can</a>.</p> <p>Disabled people, both athletes and non-athletes, are not so different from everyone else. I've been one of the lucky ones: the help and support I've had in my sporting career has enabled me to achieve so many of my goals on the running track. But I firmly believe that if a support structure was more readily available throughout society then disabled people could accomplish so much more. If nothing else we would certainly have a happier and more integrated disabled community.</p> <p>It's been said, and I agree with this wholeheartedly, that it's our environment that disables us. For example if all of our buildings and public places had proper disabled access, with Braille signage and so on, then we simply wouldn't have disabled people. We would have the same freedom of movement as everyone else. And I'm really hoping these Games can begin the long-term process of putting that in place.</p> <p>London has already broken through a significant barrier. During the bidding process, for the first time, Locog, the London organising committee, included the Paralympics on an equal scale with the Olympic Games. Even in Beijing the Paralympics was included almost like a bolt-on.</p> <p>But London submitted bids on a par with each other. They had a transport policy for both the Olympics and Paralympics. A catering policy for both and so on. This had never been done before and it's now been adopted by bidders for future Games so it's a significant step forward.</p> <p>I'm confident that the Paralympics will change people's ideas about the disabled. The Olympic athletes created role models for non-disabled people. The Paralympics I'm expecting will create role models for both disabled and non-disabled people. If people are impressed by the running of Usain Bolt for instance they might say: \"I could never be that quick.\" But what about the achievements of an athlete with one leg for example? Now that takes everything to a new level.</p> <p>Although we're disappointed the BBC didn't bid higher to cover the Games, we know that Channel 4 will do a brilliant job. In fact they are already producing programmes in the buildup that I know the Beeb wouldn't have done.

  "<p>Political wrangling over the US budget has hit profits at London-listed outsourcing company Serco, which runs everything from air-traffic control to nuclear facilities and prisons across the world.</p> <p>The company said US government agencies had postponed contract awards, delayed work, and cancelled contracts because of the stalemate over the debt ceiling.</p> <p>Serco chief executive, Chris Hyman, said the company does not expect a solution to the debt crisis \"until the presidential election and until we have a new Congress in place\". He said the US market will continue to be \"tough\" in the second half, but that it will grow in the long-term. \"People are screaming for work to be done, they are just trying to agree their funding.\"</p> <p>Overall, profits before tax and one-off items slumped 17% in the first half to \u00a3102m. In the UK, Serco saw a decline in welfare-to-work contracts but said that was offset by other contract wins, such as the deal to provide ferry services to the northern isles in Scotland.</p> <p>Hyman said: \"The UK is starting to move again. I'm cautiously optimistic about that. There were questions over whether the government would go deep into public sector reform. We've seen them do what they said.\"</p> <p>Last month, Serco won a \u00a337m contract to provide community punishment programmes in London, becoming the first private company to take over a significant portion of work from the probation service.</p> <p>The group won \u00a34.2bn of contracts in the first half, up from \u00a32.5bn in the same period last year, boosted by a \u00a31.5bn joint venture with the Ministry of Defence to provide and maintain the UK's nuclear warheads.</p> <p>It also booked \u00a315.7m of restructuring costs in the first half, which went towards creating a global business process outsourcing division to help it win more back-office work.</p>",
  "<h2>WALKING WALCOTT?</h2> <p>If Theo Walcott were a pizza delivery man, he'd often deposit a delicious steaming double pepperoni with guacomole right on your kitchen table before you'd even put the phone down after placing the order. But he'd occasionally whizz through the streets on a supersonic moped only to rashly hurl your extra-large Seafood Supreme straight into your neighbour's pigeon's coop or just drop it limply among the litter on your lawn. Such are the frustrations that must be tolerated service is being provided by Walcott.</p> <p>Mind you, the Fiver reckons his goofs are not as frequent as often portrayed and that the reason young Theo often gets such a harsh rap from fans and pundits is that, basically, he is too good. Or too goody-goody, perhaps. If he were not so polite, not so articulate and did seem to be so darn clean-cut \u2013 if, say, he hinted at a troubled upbringing or a sordid private life \u2013 then more people could warm to him, as his flaws and misfortune might offset the ill-will that many folks naturally feel towards someone who seems to be well-balanced, talented and successful without really trying. Yes, many grumblers seem to believe that fame and fortune have come too easy to Walcott, who was born with a stable environment and phenomenal speed. And lo, in much the same way that some folks like to conceal their own sense of inadequacy when they see a top model by automatically claiming she must be an air-head, Walcott is regularly denounced as a brainless footballer, with his mistakes highlighted and his clever feats downplayed.</p> <p>Walcott, at least, appears to know his worth. He has turned down the offer of a new contract from Arsenal that reportedly falls \u00a325,000 below then \u00a3100,000 per week that the winger is demanding. Arsenal, of course, could argue that Walcott is far from assured of a regular first-team spot, what with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the rise. Walcott, of course, could counter that if he leaves, then Gervinho is closer to a regular first-team spot. And Manchester City or even Liverpool could settle the discussion by weighing in with a bid of around \u00a315m and then paying Walcott what he wants. Or Walcott could decide to see out the remaining year on his Arsenal contract before leaving on a free next summer, and possibly spend this season on the lash or bleating in the press, just to see if it makes him any more popular with the public.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I'm ashamed to tell you the score.

Yet every year, 1.1 billion people live without clean drinking water, 1.3 people billion live without electricity and over 1 billion people are hungry.

In particular, what can be done to tackle the increasing imbalance of food and water resources so that no one goes without?</p> <p>The complex nature of the nexus is clear; the three elements are interdependent and have knock-on effects on each other.

  "<p>Bournemouth borough council has welcomed last weekend's restructuring of outsourcing specialist Mouchel which has led to the company being taken over by its bankers.</p> <p>Mouchel, whose other council customers include Milton Keynes, Lincolnshire, Oldham, and Bath &amp; NE Somerset councils, will be owned by MRBL, a newly incorporated company owned by Mouchel's lenders \u2013 RBS, Lloyds Banking Group and Barclays \u2013 together with the group's management after acquiring the businesses from Mouchel's administrator.</p> <p>Mouchel said the acquisition \"marks the completion of the group's financial restructuring and provides the business with a strong financial platform for the future.\"</p> <p>Councillor John Beesley, leader of Bournemouth borough council, said the deal secures a future for staff and services provided to the council.</p> <p>\"Of course, we continue to manage, monitor and review the contract closely, to ensure that service targets are being met within the agreed contract price, so guaranteeing ongoing savings to the council,\" he said. \"It essentially remains business as usual for our incremental partnership and our relationship with MRBL remains strong as they continue to deliver. Already, the partnership has created 85 jobs in the local economy, and an investment of \u00a37.71million into the Bournemouth contract.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Grant Rumbles, chief executive of Mouchel, said: \"The completion of this restructuring means that the long-term future of this business is secure and the jobs of more than 8,000 people have been preserved. We now have the right capital structure to take Mouchel forward. For our clients and suppliers it is business as usual. With a stable and supportive ownership structure and a balance sheet that is fit for purpose, Mouchel will be in a strong position to rebuild the business and start winning large contracts again.\"</p> <p>Mouchel's financial worries have, however, left some of its key customers having to make critical decisions or alternative plans as the extent of the outsourcer's financial worries emerged, although the company has insisted its working relationship with those customers is \"business as usual\".</p> <p>Earlier this year, Bournemouth's cabinet agreed to ratify a previous decision to outsource the operation of the council's human resources &amp; organisational development and finance departments to Mouchel after considering a detailed independent risk assessment based on Mouchel's financial statements, along with an impartial review of the risk management and contract governance arrangements that are already in place.</p> <p>At the time, Councillor Beesley said, \"We are extending this contract having undertaken a great deal of background work.&#xa0;The independent reviews acknowledge that all the relevant issues have been fully faced and dealt with by the council, and that robust measures have been put in place to plan for a variety of risks, including a strong exit strategy in the event of needing to bring services back in house.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"The independent reviews have commended the council's governance and risk management processes relating to the incremental partnership.&#xa0; It is this comprehensive approach that has led to the council retaining \u00a3135,000 to cover the potential cost of bringing HR and finance back in house, should Mouchel fail, together with other significantly improved contractual measures which are commercially sensitive, to safeguard the council's position.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Milton Keynes council, which had a 12-year, \u00a3200m contract with Mouchel said earlier this month that it would terminate the contract and would take most services and staff back in-house.</p> <p>It said Mouchel had successfully delivered operational and back office services but that the 12-year contract had been signed in 2004 since when the council faced \"a very different political and economic environment from when the contract was originally conceived\".</p> <p>Lincolnshire county council, which had a \u00a3490m, 16-year agreement signed in 1999, has begun a re-tender exercise, while Rochdale, which signed a 15-year, \u00a3200m contract in 2006 has shifted the contract to a subcontractor, Agilisys. Mouchel also has contracts with Oldham, Middlesbrough and Bath &amp; NE Somerset councils.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>US police have arrested Raynaldo Rivera, 20, an alleged member of the hacking group LulzSec, on charges that he took part in an extensive breach of the computer systems belonging to Sony Pictures Europe.</p> <p>Rivera, of Tempe, Arizona \u2013 who allegedly used the online nicknames of \"neuron\", \"royal\" and \"wildciv\" \u2013 surrendered to police in Phoenix six days after a federal grand jury in Los Angeles produced an indictment charging him with conspiracy and unauthorised impairment of a protected computer. If convicted, he could face 15 years in prison.</p> <p>The indictment, which was unsealed on Tuesday, accuses Rivera and co-conspirators of stealing information from Sony Pictures Europe's computer systems in May and June 2011 using an SQL injection attack \u2013 which exploits flaws in the handing of data input for databases to take control of a system \u2013 against the studio's website.</p> <p>SQL injection, or SQLi, is an increasingly common technique used by hackers to break into systems.</p> <p>The indictment says Rivera then helped to post the confidential information onto LulzSec's website and announced the intrusion via the hacking group's Twitter account.</p> <p>While Rivera was the only person named in the indictment, the FBI said his co-conspirators included Cody Kretsinger, 24, a confessed LulzSec member who pleaded guilty in April to charges stemming from his role in the Sony attack.</p> <p>Yet the indictment and the arrest still leaves open one of the most puzzling questions left by the hacking spree seen in the first half of 2011, when the hacking collective Anonymous \u2013 and LulzSec, which grew out of it, were coming to public attention.</p> <p>That is the question of who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/apr/27/playstation-network-hack-sony\" title=\"\">hacked into Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN) system in April</a>.</p> <p>The attack, which may have leaked credit card details for millions of users, has never been traced to any group \u2013 although Sony suggested not long afterwards that Anonymous might have been involved.</p> <p>Since then it has given no further details about who it suspects of carrying out the attack, and no data from the attack has ever been posted publicly.</p> <p>By contrast the Sony Pictures Europe hack of which Rivera is accused saw the data leaked on 2 June, and LulzSec's activities are generally reckoned to have begun on 30 May with the posting of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/31/pbs-victim-hackers-wikileaks\" title=\"\">fake story about Tupac Shakur</a> to the PBS website.</p> <p>Following the Sony Pictures Europe breach, LulzSec published the names, birth dates, addresses, emails, phone numbers and passwords of thousands of people who had entered contests promoted by Sony, and publicly boasted of its exploits.</p> <p>\"From a single injection we accessed EVERYTHING,\" the hackers said in a statement at the time. \"Why do you put such faith in a company that allows itself to become open to these simple attacks?\"</p> <p>Authorities have said the Sony breach ultimately cost the company more than $600,000 (\u00a3378,000).</p> <p>LulzSec, an underground group also known as Lulz Security, is an offshoot of the international hacking collective Anonymous and took credit for attacks on a number of government and private sector websites, including the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency, the US Congressional website, and the Sun and News International sites.</p> <p>The latest indictment says Rivera is suspected of using a proxy server in a bid to conceal his IP address to avoid detection.</p> <p>Court documents revealed in March that a former Anonymous member known as Sabu, whose real name is Hector Xavier Monsegur, had pleaded guilty to hacking-related charges and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/06/lulzsec-sabu-working-for-us-fbi\" title=\"\">had been providing information on his cohorts to the FBI</a> since June 2011, after he was identified as he logged into a public bulletin board from his home address.</p> <p>That same month, five other suspected leaders of Anonymous, all them alleged to be LulzSec members as well, were charged by US authorities with computer hacking and other offences.</p> <p>A number of arrests followed in the UK, where six people have been charged with various offences linked to LulzSec's activities.</p> <p>An accused British hacker, Ryan Cleary, 20, was indicted by a US grand jury in June on charges related to LulzSec attacks on several media companies, including Sony Pictures.</p> <p>Kretsinger, who pleaded guilty to the same two charges now facing Rivera, is due to be sentenced on 25 October. A prosecutor said he was likely to receive substantially less than the 15-year maximum prison term carried by those offenses.</p> <p>Monsegur, 28, a Puerto Rican living in New York, has pleaded guilty to 12 charges, including three of conspiracy to hack into computers, five of hacking, one of hacking for fraudulent purposes, one of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and one of aggravated identity theft.</p> <p>Those charges would attract a total of 124 years' jail, but it is thought he has arranged a plea bargain with the US government. Monsegur received a six-month reprieve from sentencing earlier in August in light of his cooperation with the government.</p> <p>Anonymous and its offshoots focused initially on fighting attempts at internet regulation and the blocking of free illegal downloads but have since taken aim at the Church of Scientology, global banking and other targets.</p> <p>Anonymous, and LulzSec in particular, became notorious in late 2010 when they launched what they called the first cyberwar in retaliation for attempts to shut down WikiLeaks.</p> <p>The rise of LulzSec saw a burst of similar \"crews\" aiming to hack sites, but since then Anonymous has focussed on providing an outlet for documents released by WikiLeaks.</p>",
  "<p>I guess that this book just wasn't for me, although I can see why other people might like it. Personally, I found it quite dull, and the plot was quite difficult to understand. It seemed like there was no real story in the book, and I found Tallulah Casey quite hard to relate to. This might just be because I haven't read the first book yet, (Withering Tights), I don't know.</p> <p>A Midsummer Tights Dream is about a girl called Tallulah who attends Dother Hall: a performing arts college. Maybe it's not the best performing arts college, but she meets some fabulous friends and some bewildering boys while she's there. She's not had much luck so far, but all she really wants is her dream kiss and respect for her talents (the best being Irish dancing).</p> <p>The ending is sweet, with Tallulah finally realising who is the right boy all along, (even though he wasn't the one she had in mind at the start of the book). The characters each have their own strong personalities, which I like, and there are some hilarious parts too.</p> <p>Overall, I thought that the book was very funny and good; it just wasn't for me.

  "<p>At my primary school, we boys vied for pecking position via the traditional routes of fighting, football and fabricating extravagant fibs, but there was something else. Lined up afore the trough urinal in the toilets, we discovered a crucial test of manhood: the ability to pee skywards. The class weaklings could barely defeat gravity. I was proud to occasionally reach the words \"Armitage Shanks\" while a few warriors could clear the porcelain and decorate the tiles.</p> <p>And then there was Phillip. Phillip was no ordinary Scots wean. He was a superhero, a god amongst miniature men. Phillip could squirt a volley which would rise a good six feet in the air before arcing with exquisite accuracy out of the open window. It was spectacular \u2013 I swear he must have mastered top spin. That is how the boys learned: there is direct route from bladder to masculine prestige, and the girls learned not to loiter by the big bins at playtime.</p> <p>At this point, I should probably advise male readers to take a seat. Not because I'm about to tell you something shocking, but because if the rest of the world is to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19390785\" title=\"\">follow the lead of Taiwan</a>, we'll soon have to do so several times a day. Stephen Shen, minister at the country's Environmental Protection Administration, has instigated a policy of requesting men in government buildings to sit down to urinate. He hopes the habit will spread through society to create a cleaner, healthier environment. If my female friends are anything to go by, this plan would go down well with the world's women. They talk of hygiene, bad smells and treading barefoot in puddles by night. That <em>may</em> sound reasonable but don't be fooled, dudes. It's a grand conspiracy to ensure ultimate victory in the battle to keep toilet seats down.</p> <p>I'm no biomechanic, but it seems to me that if you were to design a waste water drainage system for a semi-intelligent carbon-based lifeform, you could do little better than an easily-accessed length of flexible hosepipe, complete with directional nozzle, that can be tucked out of harm's way when not needed. And thanks to the miracle of evolution, this gadget protrudes at the precise same place on the human body where we find the zip of our trousers. It is such a miracle that one might be tempted to credit it to the intelligent design of a benevolent creator, were it not for one small design flaw \u2013 accuracy. Some women may find this hard to believe, but most of the time men are pretty accurate. Nine times out of 10 we could knock a bee off a bottletop with a single blast. The problem is that from time to time, without warning, our trusty nozzle will develop a glitch that suddenly sends an unexpected stream between the basin and the Beano annual or, on a bad day, splat between the eyes. We can't help it. Blame evolution and its shoddy attention to detail.</p> <p>So, on one side of this debate we have hygiene, public health and a pleasant living environment. On the other we have \u2026 OK I admit it \u2013 nothing. Nada. Zilch. There is not a single argument to be made for standing up to wee except, damn it, it feels right. So perhaps I could suggest a compromise. Men won't wee standing up in the bathroom on condition we are provided with a well-drained tree in the backyard that we can mark as our own. I suspect that, deep down, that's what we really want.</p>",
  "<p>Since all three main political parties ruled out expansion at Heathrow airport at the last election \u2013 the Conservatives were especially uncompromising in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2010/apr/13/conservative-manifesto-2010-policy-guide\" title=\"\">their manifesto pledge to \"stop the third runway\"</a> \u2013 it barely seems possible that it could be back on the agenda in this parliament.</p> <p>But these are desperate times. With the Tories panicking over George Osborne's failed economic policy and frustrated by the apparent policy paralysis within the coalition, the fierce and relentless lobbying campaign for a third runway waged by the aviation industry has scored another win.</p> <p>Yesterday the debate was resurrected in a bizarre tableau of mice and men \u2013 with the Conservative chair of the committee on energy and climate change, Tim Yeo, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/28/david-cameron-taunted-tory-mp-heathrow\" title=\"\">challenging the prime minister to a macho duel over the Coalition's third runway opposition</a>.</p> <p>Yeo's calls for a Heathrow U-turn to mirror <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/24/tories-third-runway-heathrow\" title=\"\">his own in March this year</a> have been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/28/heathrow-third-runway-not-solution?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">slapped down for now by the transport secretary, Justine Greening, and Number 10</a>, but we can be sure that the poorly informed debate will continue.</p> <p>Whatever the pro-camp may claim, the big-picture reality is that endless growth in aviation capacity is not sustainable. Aviation already contributes 13% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions once non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions including soot, nitrogen oxides and water vapour are taken into account.</p> <p>Worryingly, those non-CO<sub>2</sub> effects are not even included in the Climate Change Act, and therefore are not in the Committee on Climate Change's advice to government on aviation, despite the warming impact being nearly double that of CO<sub>2</sub> alone.</p> <p>Unchecked growth in capacity at Heathrow and elsewhere would make it impossible for the UK to meet its target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050 \u2013 a target which already falls short of what the science demands.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"http://www.aef.org.uk/uploads/AEF_Passenger_Forecasts_analysis_1.pdf\" title=\"\">research by the Aviation Environment Federation</a> suggests that the UK already has sufficient airport infrastructure to meet the maximum levels of future demand that would be consistent with the limits on aviation growth recommended by the Climate Change Committee.</p> <p>The government's own forecasts of air-traffic demand indicate that even if airport growth was allowed to continue free of environmental legislation, passenger demand in the south east could be met solely via the existing infrastructure until almost 2030.</p> <p>The forecasts also overestimate demand by assuming that economic growth will pick up at around 2% or more every year \u2013 hardly likely in the current climate \u2013 and that there will be no increase in oil prices.</p> <p>As Yeo rightly recognises, the economics around aviation have changed a great deal since the coalition announced its opposition to a new Heathrow runway in 2010. The oil price has risen from around $80 per barrel in 2010 to more than $120 per barrel in 2012. This factor will have by far the greatest effect in reducing demand than any other.</p> <p>Furthermore, the idea that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/15/eu-airline-emissions-tax-success\" title=\"\">inclusion of aviation in the EU emissions trading scheme</a> is a get-out-of-jail-free card for the industry is a complete myth. While it was an important step, the scheme uses questionable calculations in order to offset the emissions abroad, and once again, fails to take into account the damaging impact of non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from aircraft.</p> <p>Finally, claims that biofuels will allow aviation to expand indefinitely without causing damage are highly flawed. It's likely that there will be always be a limit on the amount of sustainable biofuels available for use in aircraft; meanwhile, the environmental and social risks involved in giving ever more land over to growing crops for fuel, rather than food, are already well documented.</p> <p>Even aside from the environmental case against a third runway at Heathrow, the idea that one runway could ever play a significant role in our economic recovery is nothing more than a foolish distraction from what we actually need \u2013 wide-scale investment for the public good, in order to create jobs and stabilise the economy.</p> <p>Tim Yeo calls for political courage in the debate and I couldn't agree more. Those in favour of endless airport expansion must finally accept that there are ecological limits to aviation growth, be honest with the public about the priority shift we need in order to deal with climate change \u2013 and drop the third runway obsession, once and for all.</p>",
  "<p>Social entrepreneurship often focuses on finding solutions to problems in the developing world. But, as the European Union battles with the ongoing recession and the US experiences rising levels of poverty, social enterprise solutions are increasingly appropriate in advanced industrial countries as well.</p> <p>Thane Kreiner, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.scu.edu/socialbenefit/index.cfm\" title=\"\">Centre for Science, Technology, and Society</a> at Santa Clara University, says that reverse innovation could one day \"help us fix what's broken in our own backyard.\"</p> <p>\"Some innovations that social entrepreneurs are bringing to the developing world help alleviate conditions of poverty, like lack of access to electricity for lighting. But some of the solutions would be extremely beneficial for us to adopt in the developed world,\" he says.</p> <p>\"If you can serve the poor profitably, you can disrupt existing markets.\"</p> <p>Healthcare has great potential for reverse innovation, especially as costs soar ever higher, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"The kind of learning that we see can inform ways that could really transform delivery of services and goods that right now are quite expensive.\"</p> <p>The US government spends more than any other OECD country on its healthcare system, even though the World Health Organisation has ranked it 37th in performance.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.aravind.org/\" title=\"\">Aravind Eye Care System</a> established by Govindappa Venkatswamy in India in 1976, has performed 4 million operations thanks to its \"McDonald's-style\" high volume assembly, says Kreiner.</p> <p>Aravind also developed the intra-ocular lens, manufactured by its subsidiary, Aurolab, at a fraction of the cost of imports.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.salauno.com.mx/\" title=\"\">SalaUno</a>, a for-profit social enterprise based in San Francisco, has now replicated the Aravind model in Mexico. Over the past year, SalaUno has carried out 133 cataract operations a month - free of charge for those who cannot afford the treatment.</p> <p>SalaUno is one of 160 social enterprises in the global social benefit incubator (GSBI) programme based at Santa Clara University in the heart of Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Last week, 19 social entrepreneurs arrived at the university for intensive in-residence coaching and lectures from some of Silicon Valley's big names such as Geoffrey Moore, author of the tech entrepreneur's rulebook, Crossing the Chasm.</p> <p>Since the programme began 10 years ago, 90% of the social enterprises are still going and have benefited about 74 million people, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"Social benefit is a necessary predecessor to economic growth,\" he says. \"Almost always it provides employment opportunities for people in those communities and acts as nuclei for economic growth.\"</p> <p>GSBI is funded by a Skoll Foundation grant and corporate gifts from Deloitte, Microsoft and Applied Materials. But the real \"secret sauce\" is the pool of high-calibre mentors from Silicon Valley, says Kreiner.</p> <p>Executives from blue chip companies such as Cisco and Intel volunteer their coaching services for the social entrepreneurs in the four months leading up to the Clara University residency.</p> <p>Ten out of the 19 on the GSBI programme are women, part of an encouraging trend, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"The rise of women in social entrepreneurship and leadership is striking. We're also seeing more sophistication, higher levels of education.\"</p> <p>Shivani Siroya founded InVenture, an SMS-based accounting tool for<br>low-income individuals and businesses and pioneered a credit-scoring standard for clients that conventional financial institutions would deem unbankable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://inventure.org/\" title=\"\">InVenture</a> now has more than 5,000 users and has made 2,000 loans with an average size of $2,000 (\u00a31,200). It is now expanding operations in Africa, where another SMS-based service, M-Pesa in Kenya, now processes 25% of the country's GDP via text message, bypassing conventional banks.</p> <p>Such ventures enable the poor to access services that would otherwise be price prohibitive, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"Even in the US, one of the most ridiculous \"poverty premiums\" is for loans where it becomes too expensive to borrow money to lift yourself out of poverty,\" he says.</p> <p>Other examples of \"reverse innovation\" on microfinance enterprises that started in the developing world and then identified a similar need in the US are Kiva, Grameen and Samasource, which is launching SamaUSA later this year.</p> <p>\"The poverty level in the US continues to climb, and Europe suffers from an ongoing recession,\" says Kreiner. \"As we search for avenues out of the economic crisis, the innovations of social enterprises like Samasource, Kiva and Grameen and their experiences of developing world poverty could help us fix what's broken in our own backyard.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>By any estimate there's a massive shortage of low and semi-skilled jobs in this country. People queue wherever opportunities arise. Yet politicians seem to have given up on trying to create such jobs. They simply cite the ever-increasing numbers of low skilled, low paid workers competing for such work on the global jobs market.</p> <p>But when <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/migratedD/ec_group/36-07-SK_b\" title=\"\">there are 10 million people of working age without any Level 2 qualifications, and one in six school leavers leave with nothing</a>, it's surely blinkered and negligent not to at least try to create work for these people. As job opportunities for low-skilled people dwindle we are allowing a huge time bomb of discontent and frustration to grow under our very eyes. It's already proving to be a significant drain on our economy in terms of benefits paid, extra cost to the NHS, increased crime and fear of crime. I believe we now need to adopt measures that create more accessible jobs.</p> <p>But in the face of intense global competition, what can we do? The first thing is to consciously put the issue on the agenda; you can't manage what you don't measure. We need to focus as much attention on creating less skilled work as we do on investing in hi-tech jobs. If we did we would start asking very different questions.</p> <p>We would ask government departments, for instance, if it was not a false economy to buy from an overseas supplier when the buying in the UK could create jobs and keep taxpayers money in the UK.</p> <p>We would ask our largest companies to look again at their corporate social responsibility agenda.</p> <p>People in deprived areas don't want charity they want jobs. So can these companies buy at least some every day products and services from firms based locally in areas of high unemployment? This would be a demonstrable act of social responsibility not the soggy sticking plaster version we see so often.</p> <p>We would ask any inward investor requesting subsidy or other support where their supplies come from. Would they be a kit assembler creating no UK jobs beyond their factory gate, or would they buy components from the local small business supply chain?</p> <p>And we would ask why our local councils are spending millions of pounds on services from companies based hundreds of miles away when there are very competent local suppliers. Are they not duty bound to support their local community?</p> <p>Protectionism. I hear the cries already but I say this \u2013 in 1846 we repealed <a href=\"http://www.britainexpress.com/History/victorian/corn-laws.htm\" title=\"\">the Corn Laws</a> because our people needed cheaper bread. What our people need now is jobs and we need to be more assertive about where we invest and what we purchase to make sure they get them. Secondly, what other major economy doesn't do this already? Would the Germans buy a British train set?</p> <p>But most importantly I say that for the our deprived communities that have borne the brunt of globalisation we should offer some sort of protection and bring jobs back to their area and provide them with the hope of a better future.</p> <p>If we simply ask how the huge budgets of these organisations could be spent in ways to create local semi-skilled jobs we will unleash an incredible amount of creative thinking about how to do it. And that creativity will be met halfway by social entrepreneurs who have great ideas.</p> <p>But beyond bringing jobs home we can create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/\">The Kings Fund</a> recently reported that better community care for the elderly would actually save the NHS millions in unnecessary emergencies. The demands for this service are disproportionately concentrated in the poorer areas of our community. This represents a huge opportunity to create real, worthwhile jobs in home care which is surely the most perfect service to be contracted locally.</p> <p>The green economy offers tremendous job creation opportunities too. In London, the congestion charge created the need for hundreds more buses and bus drivers. Surely this can be done in every major city? Every roof (domestic, municipal or commercial) with a broadly south facing aspect could be fitted with solar panels \u2013 shouldn't it be possible for local installation companies to fit for free and share the income from the energy generated?</p> <p>Industry has identified raw material shortages as a serious strategic threat to business and yet we still landfill 50 per cent of our waste and bury the valuable resources it contains. Worst still we forgo the opportunity to train people in repair and re-engineering which are skills people are crying out to learn.</p> <p>Construction is another major employer that offers a lot of semi-skilled work. There is an acute housing shortage in many parts of the country which again is often concentrated in deprived areas.</p> <p>Moreover, much of our housing stock needs considerable refurbishment. Sensibly contracted services could create thousands of jobs for local people.</p> <p>And if we start to genuinely regenerate an area then the disposable income will rise and that alone will create opportunities and niches for entrepreneurial spirit to thrive. Spirit I believe exists in all communities.</p> <p>So in essence we can create millions of new jobs \u2013 it won't be easy and it'll take some time but the journey starts with one vital question \u2013 what can we do to create work?</p> <p><em>Colin Crooks is director of </em><a href=\"http://www.treeshepherd.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Tree Shepherd</em></a><em> and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.treeshepherd.org.uk/download-my-book/\" title=\"\"><em>To Make A Million: A Social Enterprise Charter For Jobs</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Yesterday was August 28th 2012. Remember that date. It marks the day when the world went raving mad.</p> <p>Three things of note happened. The first is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">a record Arctic ice melt had just been announced</a> by the scientists studying the region. The 2012 figure has not only beaten the previous record, established in 2007. It has beaten it three weeks before the sea ice is likely to reach its minimum extent. It reveals that global climate breakdown is proceeding more rapidly than most climate scientists expected. But you could be forgiven for missing it, as it scarcely made the news at all.</p> <p>Instead, in the UK, the headlines concentrated on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/28/david-cameron-taunted-tory-mp-heathrow\" title=\"\">the call by Tim Yeo</a>, chair of the parliamentary energy and climate change committee, for a third runway at Heathrow. This sparked a lively debate in and beyond the media about where Britain's new runways and airports should be built. The question of whether they should be built scarcely arose. Just as rare was any connection between the shocking news from the Arctic and this determination to increase our emissions of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>I wonder whether we could be seeing a form of reactive denial at work: people proving to themselves that there cannot be a problem if they can continue to discuss the issues in these terms.</p> <p>The third event was that the Republican party in the United States began its national convention in Tampa, Florida \u2013 a day late. Why? Because of the anticipated severity of hurricane Isaac, which reached the US last night.</p> <p>As Kevin Trenberth of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research, <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/0008xl84w0743102/fulltext.pdf\" title=\"\">noted earlier this year</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"Basic theory, climate model simulations, and empirical evidence all confirm that warmer climates, owing to increased water vapor, lead to more intense precipitation events even when the total annual precipitation is reduced slightly \u2026 all weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be.\" </blockquote> <p>(h/t: <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/27/747071/isaac-poised-to-torment-new-orleans-as-category-1-hurricane-on-anniversary-of-katrina/\" title=\"\">Joe Romm at Climate Progress</a>)</p> <p>The Republican party's leading lights either deny climate change altogether, or argue that people can adapt to whatever a changed climate may bring, so there's nothing to worry about.</p> <p>The deluge of reality has had no impact on the party's determination to wish the physical world away. As <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/27/dont_say_climate_change/\" title=\"\">Salon.com points out</a>, most of the major figures lined up to speak at the convention deny that man-made climate change is happening.</p> <p>When your children ask how and why it all went so wrong, point them to yesterday's date, and explain that the world is not led by rational people.</p> <p><a href=\"www.monbiot.com\" title=\"\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The US looms large in much of the media coverage of Android and iOS. Google and Apple are both headquartered in Silicon Valley, as are plenty of well-funded startups and globally-recognised technology blogs.</p> <p>With 165m active iOS and Android devices in the US alone, it's also the world's biggest market for smartphone apps on these platforms. Yet the research that 165m figure is drawn from \u2013&#xa0;a <a href=\"http://blog.flurry.com/bid/88867/iOS-and-Android-Adoption-Explodes-Internationally\">study by mobile analytics firm Flurry</a> \u2013&#xa0;also makes it clear that there are opportunities well beyond the US for Android and iOS developers.</p> <p>Published earlier this week, the research is based on analytics data from 200k applications using Flurry's tools. The headline claim is that there were more than 640m Android and iOS devices in use during July 2012.</p> <p>The \"in use\" part is important, for Apple and Google's own figures tend to focus on sales (or activations, in Google's case) over the lifetime of their platforms. Apple <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/07/apple-wwdc-iphone-announcement\">said in July 2012</a> that it had sold 410m iOS devices since the first iPhone's launch in 2007, while Google <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/jun/27/google-i-o-keynote-google-tablet\">revealed in June 2012</a> that it had activated 400m Android devices.</p> <p>Flurry claims that its 165m active iOS and Android devices in July made the US the largest market in the world in terms of combined usage of the platforms \u2013&#xa0;it doesn't split them out \u2013&#xa0;ahead of China's 128m, the UK's 31m, South Korea's 28m and Japan's 22m.</p> <p>What's more interesting than the pure figures, though, is the wider trend. \"Year-over-year, Flurry calculates that net active devices in the U.S. grew by approximately 30 million, while China saw more than 100 million new active devices enter the market,\" explains Flurry's Peter Farago in the company's blog post.</p> <p>\"At this rate, China's active installed base could overtake the United States as early as the 2012 Holiday season.\"</p> <p>In fact, Flurry's separate chart of the fastest growing iOS and Android markets by active devices \u2013&#xa0;the one at the top of this article \u2013&#xa0;expands on this. China, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Iran, Vietnam, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and India make up the top 10 \u2013&#xa0;all with more than half a million active devices in July 2011.</p> <p>\"Notably, all four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are represented in the top 10-ten growth countries for smart devices, reinforcing their new stage of advanced economic development,\" wrote Farago.</p> <p>Or to put it another way: 165m active Android and iOS devices in the US is impressive, but add the BRIC countries together \u2013&#xa0;China (128m), Brazil (13m), India (11m) and Russia (9m) \u2013&#xa0;and you get 161m active devices just on these two platforms.</p> <p>Now think about potential growth. Another Flurry chart maps its active-user estimates against the adult populations of each country to gauge how near to saturation they are. It suggests that the US has 78% penetration of active iOS and Android devices, while the UK has 74%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395352781\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346232456096/flurry-chart-penetration.jpg\" alt=\"Flurry penetration chart\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Are countries like the US and UK nearing saturation point? Source: Flurry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This raises a red flag for me: three quarters of the UK population weren't using an Android or iOS device in July 2012. comScore stats <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/5/EU5_Map_Usage_via_Smartphone_Growing\">published in May</a> suggest that overall smartphone penetration was 55% in March 2012, and that's a figure that includes BlackBerry, Windows Phone and Symbian.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Google's <a href=\"http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en/graph/?country=uk&amp;category=DETAILS&amp;topic=DETAILS_PENET&amp;stat=PENET01&amp;wave=wave2&amp;age=all&amp;gender=all&amp;active=stat\">Our Mobile Planet research</a> suggests that 51% of the UK population currently owns a smartphone, with iOS and Android taking a 59% combined share of that 51%, rather than the population as a whole. Flurry's figures must include people with multiple devices \u2013&#xa0;an iPhone and an iPad, for example.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I asked Flurry's Farago about this, and he points out that Flurry's penetration stats cover 15-64 year-old adults, rather than the entire population. \"For the UK, Flurry's penetration estimate against the total population, from infants to the truly venerable, comes in at 49%,\" he says, adding that the company sees \"not that large\" an overlap for multiple device ownership.</p> <p>Even so, its stats still hint at growth to come in those BRIC markets: 10% of the Chinese adult population are using an Android or iOS device according to Flurry \u2013&#xa0;presumably with the same multiple-device caveats \u2013&#xa0;while the penetration stands at 6% in Brazil and Russia, and 1% in India.</p> <p>A bonanza in store for app developers? Perhaps. But that bonanza may well come from startups and developers based in those countries who understand the markets and the business models required for success.</p> <p>Which is a long-winded way of saying the most interesting apps companies in the next five years are more likely to come from Brazil, Russia, India and China as Silicon Valley.</p> <p><em>Updated on 29 August 2012 with Flurry's response to the question of IOS and Android penetration among the general population.</em></p>",
  "<p>How many villages in South Sudan are more than 2km from a water source? What projects are aid donors funding in Malawi, and where? What is the relationship between media coverage and money pledged for disasters and emergencies? And how good is the data recently published by aid donors?</p> <p>Hacks and hackers, developers and development experts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/24/development-data-challenge-weekend-tweets\" title=\"\">gathered at the Guardian offices in London last weekend</a> and examined these questions as part of a global <a href=\"http://developmentdatachallenge.org/\" title=\"\">Development Data Challenge</a>. The event helped kick off hackdays around the world to interrogate \u2013 and explore the limits of \u2013 recently released aid and government spending data.</p> <p>More development data is in the public domain than ever before. Governments have made recent commitments to transparency and open data. And a growing number of donors are publishing data in common formats such as the <a href=\"http://iatistandard.org/\" title=\"\">International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) standard</a>. But the debate is quickly shifting from the quantity to the quality of information released.</p> <p>Two projects over the weekend honed in on the data donors have recently published to the IATI. One tried to explore whether it is possible to track funds from donor agencies through their partners to delivery on the ground (unfortunately, they found, it isn't).

  "<p>A day after G4S revealed the cost of its Olympic contract shambles, fellow outsourcer <strong>Serco</strong> revealed a drop in profits due to reorganisation costs and order delays.</p> <p>The company, whose contracts include the Docklands light railway in London, prisons and air traffic control centres, said half year profits fell from \u00a3123m to \u00a3102m before exceptional items. In the UK and Europe, revenues fell 1% following fewer contracts in the welfare to work market, while conditions in the US federal outsourcing markets remained difficult. Overall, first half like for like revenues fell by 2%.</p> <p>But the company was positive about the outlook, with its performance expected to be weighted to the second half and a rise in contract awards during the first half from \u00a32.5bn to \u00a34.2bn. It has identified \u00a331bn of further opportunities for the group. Chief executive Christopher Hyman said:</p> <blockquote> Our business in Australasia and the middle east continues to grow strongly and, while significant challenges in the US remain, we see conditions in the UK starting to improve. The recent level of new contract wins across the group will help us deliver the anticipated strong financial performance in the second half of the year. </blockquote> <p>This optimism has helped lift Serco's shares by 4p to 566.5p in a falling market. Analyst Robert Morton at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Serco's interim results are well down on last year, reflecting a difficult trading background as well as a reorganisation programme. Cash generation in the first half was also disappointing, although there were timing elements within the shortfall. Negative organic growth in the first half is expected to reverse significantly in the second as a result of recent contract wins and the outlook for next year looks more encouraging, although in the short term the shares are likely to tread water. We remain buyers for the medium-term potential. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 23.50 points to 5752.21, with investors concerned about global growth prospects.

  "<p>Here's my story: I dropped out of A-levels about 12 years ago. At the time, I was content not to go to university: I was sick of being poor and I wanted a job. I began work as an office junior at a financial advice firm.</p> <p>However, several years later and still doing that sort of work, I found myself increasingly miserable and bored. So I began an evening \"access to university\" course in humanities at the City Lit college in London.</p> <p>I wasn't thinking about a change of career \u2013 I thought all I needed was a sense of achievement. And when I applied to go to Queen Mary University to read English, it was mostly just to see if I could get in.</p> <p>But studying there opened my eyes. I realised I could never be happy in my job. I was a useless financial services administrator, and the financial services sector left me cold. I had to change my career. After graduating, I completed a postgraduate certificate in journalism at Birkbeck, University of London.</p> <p>Rather naively, I at first assumed my degree plus my previous work experience would be enough to make the transition from administrator to copy writer.</p> <p>However, the recession and high unemployment means an internship has become a necessary step to realising my goal.</p> <p>I feel a million years old. And I've never heard of an intern over the age of 21, let alone 30. Can you have a mature intern?</p> <p>David Winter of C2, part of <a href=\"http://www.careers.lon.ac.uk/output/Page19.asp\" title=\"\">the Careers Group</a> at University of London, admits: \"You may find people who look at you with suspicion as a mature student trying to get an internship.\"</p> <p>Suspicion? This is subject matter ripe for the Hollywood rom-com: you know the genre \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322330/\" title=\"\">Freaky Friday</a> or Jack Black in teenage masquerade trying to pull a teacher.</p> <p>Suspicion at best, I'm thinking. More likely ridicule. Actually, there's no tangible evidence for either. Neil Sandy, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.truestone.co.uk\" title=\"\">Truestone Asset Management</a> tells me: \"We would love to employ a mature intern, as we believe they have would much to offer the company. However, so far, we have yet to receive an application.\"</p> <p>Advertising agency <a href=\"http://www.bmbagency.com/\" title=\"\">Beattie McGuinness Bungay</a> have gone a step further, offering placements to non-graduates, for reasons Alex Brown, head of talent, explains: \"We've always believed in trying to find and attract the very best new talent to the advertising industry, irrespective of educational background. Our scheme opens its doors to grads and and non-grads.</p> <p>\"We have found that the non-grads are often over 25. They may be looking for a complete career change or they have experience in related industries and are looking to bring those skills to a more creative environment.\"</p> <p>Twenty percent of BMB interns are \"mature\". But BMB is in the minority: most major companies still pluck young graduates straight from university.</p> <p>According to Ucas figures, <a href=\"http://www.ucas.ac.uk/about_us/media_enquiries/media_releases/2012/20120531\" title=\"\">24% of those applying for university in 2012 are mature students</a> (see table 4). Clearly, this figure does not correlate with the number of mature students currently benefitting from company internships.</p> <p>David Winter offers the following advice: \"Be prepared to explain how your life experience has given you the ability and confidence to deal with situations relevant to your new career area that someone who has gone straight from school to university would find harder to tackle.\"</p> <p>All this reminds me of how I felt starting university at 26. I was anxious. I didn't really want to get smashed at a foam party and try my luck with the university rugby team, did I? At my age? Of course I did.</p> <p>Internships should be no different. With some luck, I may exorcise the demon of Freaky Friday \u2013 and establish a clear trajectory to my chosen career.</p>",
  "<p>As a physician working in the East End of London, I am familiar with medically under-served populations. Yet when I began volunteering my time and my company's resources with <a href=\"http://www.specialolympics.org/\" title=\"\">Special Olympics</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.specialolympics.org/healthy_athletes.aspx\" title=\"\">Healthy Athletes programme</a> nearly a decade ago, I was shocked and saddened by the extent of the lack of proper healthcare seen among the athletes with learning disabilities.</p> <p>Healthy Athletes offers athletes free health screenings as well as free services like prescription eyewear, hearing aids, and other health related products, services and education. As global partner, Health One Global designed and manage what has become the world's richest, largest database of health parameters of people with a learning disability.</p> <p>At the most recent Special Olympics World Games in Athens last summer, 3,751 athletes from 160 countries received free health screenings. Our findings were shocking. Some 66% failed eye screening, 22% failed hearing screening, 46% had untreated dental decay, 69% had gait abnormalities, 20% needed a follow-up hearing test, 15% needed urgent dental treatment, 8% had raised blood pressure and needed urgent followup.</p> <p>And these are elite athletes who travelled internationally to a global sports competition. If they cannot receive proper care for their teeth, we can only fear for their undetected or untreated diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or kidney disease.</p> <p>Thankfully, with more than 4 million athletes in 170 countries participating in more than 50,000 events annually, Special Olympics has the global reach to take action.</p> <p>Still there is a missing piece. If information is power,&#xa0;it must be&#xa0;put in the hands of the athletes. We cannot leave it to healthcare services&#xa0;alone&#xa0;to meet their needs. &#xa0;</p> <p>Special Olympics is pioneering an internet-based personal health record to empower athletes and their families to transform co-ordination of care, change behaviours and optimise their own health outcomes using mobile health to overcome the barriers of disability, poverty, education, literacy, age, race and gender.</p> <p>Automatic messages to athletes' mobile phones, driven by their personal health record, will follow up the significant problems found at screenings, assess the impact on athletes of services delivered and deliver health promotion material. Since athletes with long-term conditions (such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease or epilepsy) are often poorly followed up we will embed personal care pathways in their record to generate automatic alerts and reminders direct to their mobile phone.</p> <p>Special Olympics embraces the power of mobile health and we have run pilots in the US and South Africa. We surveyed 2,281 athletes in Athens and 42% worldwide already have their own personal mobile phone including 55% in Europe.</p> <p>In the UK we will begin at the Special Olympics Great Britain national games in 2013.</p> <p>Special Olympics athletes' needs mirror those of many other disadvantaged populations, irrespective of the cause. This Special Olympics solution could transform the health outcomes of other disadvantaged populations.</p> <p>As the Paralympic Games open here in London, it's important that we keep alive the Olympic spirit of creating a better world through equity and fair play.

  "<p>For three decades, the gap between China's rapid economic growth and western economies' increasingly poor performance has widened. Throughout the 1980s, China's economy grew <a href=\"http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2012/08/how-china-increased-its-lead.html\" title=\"\">on average</a> 6.7% a year faster than OECD economies. During the 1990s, the lead increased to 7.4% and since 2000, it has been 8.4%.</p> <p>But with China's increasing lead in economic growth <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2012-08/03/content_26114793.htm\" title=\"\">came the claim</a> that its economy faced an imminent meltdown. As such claims clearly bore no relation to the facts, they functioned as propaganda. For this reason, they were particularly <a href=\"http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204358004577029972941870172.html?mod=googlenews_wsj&amp;mg=reno-hongkong-wsj\" title=\"\">emphasised</a> at various points during the western economic slowdown.</p> <p>It is therefore unsurprising that, as the latest data shows US GDP growth slowing to 1.5% and the EU's economy contracting at an annualised -0.6%, articles duly appeared warning of immense crisis in China. A typical example appeared in the New York Times, where under the dire headline \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/business/global/chinas-economy-besieged-by-buildup-of-unsold-goods.html?ref=asia\" title=\"\">China confronts mounting piles of unsold goods</a>\", the author advanced the following analysis: \"The glut of everything from steel and household appliances to cars and apartments is hampering China's efforts to emerge from a sharp economic slowdown.\" The article lists various data regarding China's housing and car markets, and argued that \"problems in China give some economists nightmares\".</p> <p>Let's examine what's really happening instead: the market economy necessarily continuously has sectors with shortages, and others with excess supply \u2013 the market exists to create the adjustments arising from this. As there are always \"unsold goods\" in individual sectors, it does not prove anything as they may be balanced by others in which shortages exist.</p> <p>Take current examples from China. Its car makers are currently facing difficulties, in part due to city authorities making car ownership more difficult (they realised that given China's population, attempting to have the same balance between public and car transport as in the west creates gridlock). But in another sector, China's mainland smartphone producers are currently enjoying huge competitive success, seizing <a href=\"http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&amp;ID=201208260005\" title=\"\">54% of China's market</a> (now the <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/fttechhub/2011/11/china-smartphone-market-overtakes-us/#axzz1eLbCYPlD\" title=\"\">world's largest</a>) from non-mainland producers. Chinese firms such as Lenovo, Coolpad, Huawei and ZTE are pushing ahead of Apple and Taiwan's HTC in market share.</p> <p>Only the <em>average</em> of all sectors shows the real economic situation, and that trend is clear: China's economy has slowed moderately. Its year on year GDP growth in the second quarter of 2012 was 7.6%. Over the same period, the US economy grew by <a href=\"http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&amp;step=1\" title=\"\">2.2%</a>, the EU's was up by <a href=\"http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/setupModifyTableLayout.do\" title=\"\">0.2%</a> and the UK's shrank by <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/datasets-and-tables/data-selector.html?cdid=ABMI&amp;dataset=pn2&amp;table-id=C2\" title=\"\">0.5%</a>. China's GDP growth was therefore three times that of the US, 74 times that of the EU and going in the opposite direction to the UK. This is quite sufficient to show that China's economy is not in a crisis comparable to the west: what is claimed to be crisis in China would be unparalleled economic success in the US or Europe.</p> <p>This does not mean China faces no economic problems. In the last decade, China has undergone the most rapid increase in <a href=\"http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2012/08/in-the-last-10-years.html\" title=\"\">per capita GDP</a> in a major economy in human history; it is impossible to undergo such growth without problems \u2013 among the most notable being serious environmental issues and a socially destabilising level of income inequality.</p> <p>In the first half of this year, China's economic policy making was also hampered by influences stemming from the <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2012-03/02/content_24786018.htm\" title=\"\">erroneous</a> World Bank Report on China, which advocated abandoning the economic policies inaugurated by <a href=\"http://ablog.typepad.com/keytrendsinglobalisation/2012/02/deng-xiaoping-and-john-maynard-keynes-1.html\" title=\"\">Deng Xiaoping</a>, which have produced such success. It recommended that China should instead adopt a western economic structure \u2013 a somewhat strange proposal given the current crisis of the US/European economic model. This led to initial hesitation in launching sufficient state investment to reverse economic slowdown, a mistake corrected in July when premier Wen Jiabao <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/07/11/1079141/\" title=\"\">stated</a> \"currently the main task is to promote reasonable investment growth\" followed by China's <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2012-08/27/content_26341615.htm\" title=\"\">regional authorities</a> rolling out wider investment-based stimulus programmes.</p> <p>There are serious economic policy issues to be discussed on China. The latest blooming of the hardy perennial \"the coming collapse of China\" is not among them.</p>",

The political press will look at the soft voice, the perfect appearance, the unnamed examples of struggling Americans, the punctuating giggles, and just roll their eyes and conclude it must be some 1950s television image reheated and served up for today.</p> <p>But for the millions of Americans who'd had little or no <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/republican-national-convention-2012-live\">exposure to Ann Romney before Tuesday night</a>, it was a home run: a warm, personal speech and an extremely effective introduction. The vast majority of the electorate hits the channel-changer at the first string of numbers and percentages, but when Ann Romney says, \"the price at the pump you can't believe \u2026 School sports are now an extra fee. Everything has become harder \u2026\" it's on a personal scale and extremely effective.</p> <p>You would love to have the Romneys as neighbors. She would be having you over all the time. He might seem a little stiff, and the dinner parties never had any booze, but you knew you could trust them and she would always seem happy to see you. </p> <p>In other news: sometime in the not distant future, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/artur-davis-speech-_n_1831712.html\">former Alabama Congressman Artur Davis</a>, a Democrat-turned-Republican, is going to run for office \u2013 perhaps one of the House seats outside Washington in northern Virginia, probably the seat of Representative Gerry Connolly. Based on how intensely, humorously, and powerfully he made the case for Romney to disappointed independents and Democrats, he will have a <em>lot</em> of Republicans eager to help him out, from high-dollar donors to grassroots conservatives.</p> <p>The opening of Christie's speech was more \"Jersey\" than eating a pretzel with giant salt crystals while coming out of Giants Stadium after watching the Jets lose a late-season game, hearing Bruce Springsteen blasting from a Camaro driven by a long-haired guy smoking a cigarette, seeing the Secaucus swamp beyond \u2026 I'm sorry, I got a little lost on memory lane there. Bottom line: it was really, really New Jersey.</p> <p>The line and theme \"respect over love\" was an interesting angle to take. If Ann Romney's speech was about love, Christie's was about tough love, about demanding more from politicians. One of the most effective lines was declaring that any suggestion from a politician that problems can be solved without sacrifice is a lie. Obama talks about his tax hikes on the richest Americans, but insists that all of his agenda \u2013 his jobs plan, enacting Obamacare, debt control \u2013 will not ask more of Americans.</p> <p>Of course, now Romney's convention address is forced to acknowledge some of these hard truths that voters are reluctant to hear.</p> <p>You know which two words didn't come up very often in Christie's speech? \"Mitt Romney\". I counted five references, all towards the end. It was an OK speech for the interests of the nominee, a solid speech for the interests of the party \u2026 and a fantastic speech for the interests of Chris Christie.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ana-marie-cox\">Ana Marie Cox</a>: 'Christie wanted to evoke the GOP as the enforcer'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478588\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/28/1317225418768/Annmarie_Cox.jpg\" alt=\"Ana Marie Cox\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Republicans counter-programmed themselves tonight: the speeches of Ann Romney and Chris Christie bore superficial resemblances to each other (hits on Obama, plaudits for moms), but taken together, they suggest the dissonance that's haunted the GOP since the primaries began.</p> <p>Ann Romney's speech asked people to consider Mitt as a family man and private person. She told us, \"Tonight, I want to talk to you about love.\" </p> <p>Chris Christie took tenderness and crushed it in one meaty paw, delivering a sideways knock at Obama's perceived neediness at the same time:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I believe we have been paralyzed with our desire to be loved.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ann Romney wanted us to think about the Republican party as empathetic to the needs of working people, for whom \"the last few years have been harder than they needed to be.\" (True enough, though her evocation of a golden time when school sports \"used to be free\" had me checking the calendar to see which decade I was in for this convention.) </p> <p>Christie, meanwhile, wanted to evoke the GOP as the enforcer: it is become Death, destroyer of unions! Most notably, Ann Romney talked about Mitt. Christie \u2026 not so much.</p> <p>Of the two, it was Ann Romney's speech that may prove to have the less sustainable narrative, in part because of its internal inconsistencies. She can reference college days filled with tuna bake and desks made out of sawhorses all she wants, but now, she has a car elevator and all her horses do dressage. That isn't an American success story, it's privilege finding its own level.</p> <p>Christie's speech, Romney-free as it was, presented the GOP not just as it wants to be seen, but as it is right now: brusque, glib, in love with the sound of its own voice and talking about tough choices from the cushiest seat in the house.</p> <p><em>Ana Marie Cox is US political columnist for the Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Christie's speech seemed like an audition for his own presidential campaign'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478589\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/05/27/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When the candidate's wife is introduced at a fundraiser, many superlatives are applied. Sometimes, they're jokes \u2013 she's my campaign treasurer! In Ann Romney's case, top campaign surrogate shouldn't be a punchline; it should be her full-time role.</p> <p>Mitt Romney comes across as cold and robotic. His wife is warm, charming and skilful at a difficult task: humanizing the Republican nominee. Her delivery was effective, her frequents bouts of laughter made it seem like she was having fun, and she subtly pushed back against the \"war on women\" narrative favored by the left.</p> <p>If the speech had downsides, it was probably overdoing the tuna noodle casserole bit \u2013 Romney did indeed build that, but he never was exactly poor \u2013 and the conclusion, which seemed to compare electing a president to going out on a date.</p> <p>If Ann Romney was maternal, Chris Christie was paternal \u2013 despite his moving tribute to his mother. He also appeared to contradict Mrs Romney's emphasis on love, saying it is better to be respected. But he rallied the troops well and made the case for difficult budget cuts in layman's terms.</p> <p>His attack on leaders who want to be cool and popular, always saying yes, when the right answer is no, was a not-too-subtle slap at President Obama. But the speech went on too long and started to lose focus toward the end. Ultimately, with its focus on his record in New Jersey, Christie's speech seemed more like an audition for his own presidential campaign.</p> <p>In other news, remember the name <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/28/republican-convention-to-feature-rising-star-mia-love/\">Mia Love</a>.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Consistency or truth were not much in evidence at Tampa'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395478590\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So, in the primetime hour of Tuesday night's Republican National Convention, there was something of an odd juxtaposition. Ann Romney began her treacly, pablum-filled valentine to her husband with the simple declaration that \"tonight I want to talk to you about love.\" A generous sentiment and one that spoke to a desire among Republicans to soften their negative, combative image and humanize the party nominee.</p> <p>Yet, half an hour later, the combative governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, told the cheering crowd in an \"eat your medicine\"-style address, \"we choose respect over love.\"</p> <p>Huh? Not a lot of consistency there, but then, fealty to consistency or truth were not much in evidence last night in Tampa.</p> <p>Indeed, the first two hours of the convention began with speaker after speaker riffing off President Obama's statement \"you didn't build that\" \u2013 a sentence that was uttered in reference to how government can help entrepreneurship prosper, but has become, in the hands of Republican partisans, a shorthand for the president's supposed assault on the free market in America. Quite simply, <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/\">it's a lie</a>; but it's one that Republicans seem intent on repeating for all that it is worth.</p> <p>Yet, the \"you didn't build that\" line, while the most repeated and most stunningly dishonest, was hardly the only misleading statement of the evening. Instead, a cavalcade of misinformation defined the first day of the 2012 RNC. Republicans trotted out the charge that Obama had gutted welfare (he hasn't); that Obamacare puts government bureaucrats between patients and doctors (he doesn't); that Obama called Americans \"bumps in the road\" (he didn't); that he is responsible for creating $5tn in debt (Congress and the recession also had something to do with that).</p> <p>And yet, none of this stopped Christie from describing the Republican party and its nominee, Mitt Romney, as the ones who will tell the American people honest truths about the challenges facing America.</p> <p>Bottom line: it's gonna be a long couple of days here in Florida.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p>"
