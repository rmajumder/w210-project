  "<p>The International Paralympic Committee maintained on Sunday night that the shock new T43/44 Paralympic 200m champion, Alan Oliveira, who beat the poster boy Oscar Pistorius, had broken no rules.</p> <p>After Oliveira stunned Pistorius in the final 30 metres of a race the South African had never lost at a major championships, Pistorius accused the Brazilian of running on blades that were too long and made the race unfair. \"Not taking away from Alan's performance, he's a great athlete, but these guys are a lot taller and you can't compete [with the] stride length. You saw how far he came back. We aren't racing a fair race. I gave it my best.\"</p> <p>Pistorius said he had been raising the issue with the IPC for \"several weeks\" and also named Blake Leeper, who took bronze, as another rival whose blades were too long. He said that their blades elevated their knees to four inches above their natural height and lengthened their stride patterns. Pistorius claimed their times were \"ridiculous\", despite the fact that the world record he set on Saturday night was 0.15 seconds faster than Oliveira's winning time of 21.45sec.</p> <p>The IPC said Oliveira's blades and those of the American Leeper were well within the legal length.</p> <p>A spokesman for the IPC said: \"There is a rule in place regarding the length of the blades which is determined by a formula based on the height and dynamics of the athlete. All athletes were measured today prior to competition by a classifier and all were approved for competition.\"</p> <p>Later the IPC said it would convene a meeting between Pistorius's camp and its chief medical officer, Peter van de Vliet, to discuss the South African's concerns \"without the emotion of tonight's race\".</p> <p>A calmer Pistorius added: \"I'd just like to congratulate Alan. I shook his hand outside on the track. He did a great performance tonight and I wish him the best and my focus is going to be on my upcoming races. I wasn't able to defend my title in the 200m but hopefully I'll be able to do so on the 400m and maybe, with a bit of luck, the 100m.\"</p> <p>Oliveira, who lost his legs at the age of two months, shocked a capacity crowd when he stormed past Pistorius with 30m to go and won in 21.45sec. He said he was \"disappointed\" with the claims from Pistorius. Using tactics usually employed to devastating effect by the South African, Oliveira had tracked Pistorius round the bend and ran him down on the straight to win by seven-hundredths of a second amid gasps from the crowd.</p> <p>Pistorius had previously praised the fact that Paralympic fields are getting stronger but he was undone by one of the young guns who are now looking to shoot him down. The South African, who is the first double amputee to compete on the track at both the Olympics and Paralympics, had appeared to be in the form of his life during a heat on Saturday night in which he broke a world record he had set in 2007. The \"Blade Runner\" waved to the crowd as he came out to a huge roar and a blaze of flashes but looked nervous before the start.</p> <p>There was none of Usain Bolt's braggadocio or horseplay. Afterwards he appeared disbelieving. \"I think Alan's a great athlete but \u2026 I run just over 10 metres per second, I don't know how you can come back, watching the replay, from eight metres behind on the 100 to win. It's absolutely ridiculous.\"</p> <p>At the start the athletes were forced to wait in the call room for an extra half an hour as the schedule overran amid endless medal ceremonies.</p> <p>Before the race Pistorius said it was \"great to have rivals in the sport evolving\". But his comments after being beaten did not appear to match his pre-race sentiments, as he urged the IPC to look into the issue. Just as it was the depth of talent in the 100m and 200m Olympic fields that made those races iconic, and not simply Bolt's performances in winning them, so the same is true for Pistorius's emerging rivals in the Paralympic sprints.</p> <p>But instead of recognising that fact, Pistorius went on the offensive. Oliveira said he believed it was a deliberate tactic to unsettle him before the race.</p> <p>\"Pistorius is a great athlete. The interview when he said my blades were too big, he was bothered by the time I had in the semi-finals and wanted to get to me with this polemic. But it did not work. I don't know with whom he's picking a fight, it's not with me,\" he said.</p> <p>\"For me he is a really great idol. And to hear that coming from a really great idol is difficult.\"</p> <p>Oliveira \u2013 who said he was inspired by his family, his girlfriend and \"the whole Brazilian people\" \u2013 put his victory down to training and hard work. Pistorius has long said he views the Olympic and Paralympic Games as equals. But it is the size and fervour of the crowds in London's Olympic Stadium that is proving his point. When he broke the world record in the heats on Saturday night, he brought the house down. The cheers from the Olympic Stadium mingled with those of the Aquatics Centre, where Ellie Simmonds was writing her own chapter in the history of this remarkable summer.</p> <p>On Sunday, in front of another capacity crowd of 80,000 fanatical spectators, the cheers for Pistorius were \u2013 if anything \u2013 even louder. Oliveira remarked afterwards on the contrast between the huge cheers at the start for Pistorius, who has done so much already to break down the barriers between disabled and non-disabled sport, and the silence when his name was announced. It was a different story at the finish.</p> <p>The night brought to mind some of the biggest evenings in the stadium during the Olympics, where anticipation of hoped-for homegrown success from David Weir mingled with the excitement of seeing a genuine global star. What they got was the biggest shock of either Games to date.</p> <p>The pair will renew their rivalry in the T43/44 400m and the 100m, where they will also face the British world record holder Jonnie Peacock.</p>",
  "<p>Israel is \"pillaging\" the natural resources of the Dead Sea which lie in occupied Palestinian territory in violation of international law, a report which singles out the cosmetics firm Ahava for criticism.</p> <p>According to the Palestinian human rights organisation al-Haq, the \"appropriation and exploitation of Palestinian land and natural resources in the occupied Dead Sea area by Israeli settlers and companies \u2026 meet the requirements of the crime of pillage\".</p> <p>Its report, Pillage of the Dead Sea, says Israeli restrictions on planning and movement \"have severely hampered the ability of Palestinians to use and access their land and other natural resources in the region. The presence of settlers who directly utilise and profit from the Dead Sea wealth has severely exacerbated this situation and contributed to the over-exploitation of the area, resulting in severe environmental damage.\"</p> <p>Almost two-thirds of the western shore of the Dead Sea lies within the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967. The remaining area is in Israel, and the eastern shore is in Jordan. At the lowest point on Earth, 410 metres below sea level, the inland sea is a magnet for tourists keen to float in its salt-saturated waters and for industries which extract its minerals.</p> <p>Ahava Dead Sea Laboratories, which manufactures and markets beauty products based on Dead Sea minerals and mud, is located within the Israeli settlement of Mitzpe Shalem in the West Bank. It is licensed by the Israeli government to mine Dead Sea raw materials. According to al-Haq, almost 45% of its shares are owned by Mitzpe Shalem and another Israeli settlement on the Dead Sea shore, Kalia.</p> <p>Within two decades of its launch in 1988, Ahava's annual global sales had reached almost $150m (\u00a395m). The company has been the target of boycott campaigns by anti-settlement activists, which contributed to its decision to close its store in Covent Garden, London, a year ago.</p> <p>The al-Haq report says Ahava is \"unlawfully utilising the Palestinian natural resources of the Dead Sea area for its own economic profits and therefore can be considered directly responsible for the pillage of the occupied territory's natural resources in clear violation of customary international law\".</p> <p>However, in a letter circulated in 2010, Ahava said: \"The mud and minerals used in Ahava's cosmetic products are not excavated in an occupied area. The minerals are mined in the Israeli part of the Dead Sea, which is undisputed internationally.\"</p> <p>Ahava did not respond to a request for comment on the al-Haq report.</p> <p>The land along the Dead Sea shore was classified as \"Area C\" in the 1993 Oslo accords, in which Israel has full military and administrative control. Much of the land has been declared or registered as \"state land\", which has \"dispossessed Palestinians of extensive portions of the Dead Sea land, effectively depriving them of the possibility of benefiting from [its] natural resources,\" according to the report.</p> <p>Al-Haq says \"Israel is openly in violation of its obligations under international and humanitarian law as an occupying power \u2026 because it is encouraging and facilitating the exploitation of Palestinian natural resources and actively assisting their pillaging by private actors.\" It cites The Hague regulations and the statute of the international criminal court.</p> <p>In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said that, under the Oslo accords, Israel had territorial jurisdiction that includes land, subsoil and territorial waters in Area C. It \"therefore would be entitled to licence a company to excavate mud in that area if it chose to do so\".</p> <p>The al-Haq report calls on the European Union to adopt restrictions on the import of Israeli products originating from settlements, and urges cosmetic retailers to provide clear information about the origin of products they sell to allow consumers to make an informed choice about purchases. <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>You might hum the tune, but you sing the words, and for at least one generation the words were Hal David's, the songwriter in one of the great composer-lyricist collaborations of the 20th century, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/02/hal-david\" title=\"\">died</a> on Saturday. Hal David wrote phrases that skewered the heart of the lovestruck teenager, especially when interpreted by Dionne Warwick, words that pumped tragedy into the breakup and resolve into the determination to milk every minute of it. What do you get when you fall in love, he asked. You get enough germs to catch pneumonia, he answered. After you do he'll never phone ya. He hitched the eternal to the everyday and made both seem credible. But he wasn't only the laureate of the lovesick. With Burt Bacharach, world peace, global harmony and the grit behind the glamour were merged in words and music.

  "<p>\u2022 An article about new figures from the Office for National Statistics on healthy life expectancy (HLE) erred in suggesting that this was \"a measure of how long people thought they would live free from the debilitating effects of chronic disease or disability\".

  "<p>On my last trip to Lagos, I drove past a new supermarket in an upper-middle-class part of the city. It was a huge concrete thing with sliding electronic gates, CCTV cameras and the sleek live wires that have replaced barbed wire in all fashionable districts. I remarked to my cousin, who was driving, that the building hadn't been there a year ago.</p> <p>\"You have to see inside then,\" she said, swinging her car around. Hidden inside this building, which looked like a small military base, was an exact replica of Tesco, she explained to me. There were wide aisles, Dairylea and the greatest joy of all, trolleys. Despite my cousin's best efforts, I could not muster any enthusiasm for what was in essence an incredibly exclusive grocery store, and after I insisted on going home to my dinner, she gave up, saying with disappointment: \"And I thought you were interested in development.\"</p> <p>For the sake of this thing called development, the UK has created an entire government agency, the UN has employed countless people, and billions of dollars have been pumped into the African continent. But what exactly does development look like when it has happened? Surely not this gated shop with its parking lot filled with buffed SUVs. Yet, increasingly, friends and family in Nigeria will confidently point to such places as proof that the country is&#xa0;advancing.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the rich have become richer since I left Lagos seven years ago. When I first moved to the UK, I would convert everything mentally into naira \u2013 which, at about 200 naira to the pound, made even lip gloss seem prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>Now, when I go back, I convert everything to pounds, and wonder if everyone has gone mad. How does one spend \u00a330 on a burger, and a very dry burger at that? How could the cheapest tickets to see the musical FELA! be priced at more than \u00a3100 and how, for goodness sake, did the show then sell out? This is the new Lagos my family and friends are keen to show me. It is a Lagos of spas and shopping centres and franchises. Everything is foreign-made and imported, right down to the scented candles and the ketchup on the menus.</p> <p>I often tease my relatives, who are proudly living this Nigerian dream, about the hollowness of their situation. Only in Nigeria do the Mercedes-driving, Gucci-wearing, champagne-drinking inhabitants of a mansion still have to worry about running water. Money, I point out when their bragging becomes unbearable, can do only so much to cushion the effects of living in a third-world country.</p> <p>One day, the Nigerian upper-middle classes will have to act on the realisation&#xa0;that there are some things you cannot import. Lasting development that will put knowledge into the minds of our youth, and bring roads to my father's village and electricity to our homes, is more than a shipping container away. Economic advancement for a few will never be a substitute for development.</p> <p>Towards the end of my trip, I found myself in one of the global franchise hotels that are springing up all over the country. The hotel restaurant was French-themed and, to my untrained eye, it looked reasonably authentic. The chefs in their tall hats, the racks of wine, the dark wood furnishings \u2013 all continental enough for me but, when I put my spoon to my mouth, the lights flickered and died.</p> <p>\"Nepa,\" someone said \u2013 cursing the National Electric Power Authority, which has never managed to create a steady energy supply.</p> <p>\"Nigeria,\" another added.</p> <p>When the lights came on, I swallowed my soup and returned to France.</p>",
  "<p>Britain has allowed key members of Egypt's toppled dictatorship to retain millions of pounds of suspected property and business assets in the UK, potentially violating a globally-agreed set of sanctions.</p> <p>The situation has led to accusations that ministers are more interested in preserving the City of London's cosy relationship with the Arab financial sector than in securing justice.</p> <p>Hosni Mubarak, the ousted former president, was sentenced to life in jail in June. A six-month investigation, conducted by BBC Arabic and released in conjunction with the Guardian and al-Hayat, a pan-Arab newspaper, has identified many valuable assets linked to his family and their associates that have not been frozen.</p> <p>These include luxury houses in Chelsea and Knightsbridge and companies registered in central London. One member of Mubarak's inner circle has even been permitted to set up a UK-based business in recent months, despite being named on a <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/public_notice_egypt_220311.pdf\" title=\"\">British Treasury sanctions list</a> (pdf) of Egyptians who are linked to misappropriated assets and subject to an asset-freeze.</p> <p>In response to the investigation, the Foreign Office said it was working closely with its Egyptian counterparts to hunt down Mubarak regime assets. The Treasury, which has a dedicated unit tasked with implementing financial sanctions, said it was confident it had acted properly. Both departments said they could not comment on individual cases.</p> <p>The revelations will embarrass British ministers, who have previously expressed support for the Arab uprisings and vowed to take \"decisive action\" to track down and return illicit funds taken out of Egypt.</p> <p>Yet 18 months on from the downfall of Mubarak, publicly-accessible records from Companies House and Land Registry indicate that the fortunes of regime figures convicted of embezzling money from Egypt remain at least partially on UK soil and untouched by British authorities.</p> <p>The problem is compounded by the apparent lack of political will in Egypt when it comes to chasing former regime assets \u2013 a situation which some experts attribute to the continued influence of major players from the Mubarak era.</p> <p>Egypt's government is currently pursuing a lawsuit against the UK Treasury for dragging its heels on asset recovery.</p> <p>\"This is a collective crime from both the British and Egyptian governments,\" said Dr Mohamed Mahsoob, a public investigator who led enquiries into Egypt's \"stolen billions\" and who has since been appointed to the country's new cabinet.</p> <p>\"The UK is one of the worst countries when it comes to tracing and freezing Egyptian assets,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The British are saying that they need official requests from the Egyptian government before they take any action and that until this happens they are allowing the free movement of assets and the closure of certain accounts of companies beyond UK borders, to be reinvested elsewhere under different guises in order to prevent it from being retrieved.</p> <p>\"This is pure political profiteering that doesn't reflect the concept of British justice and democracy that we teach in Egyptian universities.</p> <p>\"The UK is doing nothing less than bleeding Egyptian assets, which can only be to the detriment of the Egyptian nation.\"</p> <p>An aggressive free-market reform programme instituted by the Mubarak regime in the 1990s and 2000s saw previously state-owned companies and landholdings shift into the hands of private businessmen at an astonishing rate. Prominent \"big sharks\" within the ruling NDP party \u2013 including Mubarak's playboy son and assumed successor Gamal \u2013 amassed huge riches. Popular anger with the scale of corruption was a driving force behind Egypt's revolution.</p> <p>As political shockwaves from Egypt's upheaval spread throughout the region, Britain's political leaders scrambled to realign themselves with the revolutionaries.</p> <p>David Cameron declared that the UK government was a friend of the Egyptian people and ready to \"help in any way we can\".</p> <p>Three days after Mubarak's downfall, with popular pressure to recover Egypt's 'stolen billions' mounting in the street, the interim government in Cairo requested that western authorities freeze the assets of several former regime members who were suspected of embezzling public funds and hiding them in property and business interests.</p> <p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, told MPs the request would be co-operated with, and government ministers promised \"firm, decisive and prompt action\".</p> <p>Yet although Switzerland took only half an hour to begin freezing Egyptian regime assets following Mubarak's overthrow, the UK took 37 days to follow suit \u2013 a delay which critics say could have allowed assets to be liquidated and illicit funds to be moved offshore.</p> <p>And while Switzerland has frozen almost \u00a3500m of suspect Egyptian assets, the UK has frozen less than a fifth of that and returned none of it to Egypt.</p> <p>Meanwhile nearly half of Egypt's population lives below the poverty line, and the country's government has just requested a controversial \u00a33bn loan from the IMF to help stabilise its economy.</p> <p>Professor Mark Pieth, one of the world's leading authorities on cross-border asset recovery, said the revelations were not surprising.</p> <p>\"As a citizen I would be outraged,\" he told the BBC. \"But as a lawyer I would say it doesn't astonish me that much because I'm not sure that the rules on so-called PEPs [Politically Exposed People] are really fully implemented in the UK. The state is not bending over backwards yet to help.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Egypt had a strong relationship to the west, and quite a strong relationship to the UK for that matter.</p> <p>\"I'm thinking especially of all sorts of Arab banks with their subsidiaries in the City of London. If you go for a walk in the City you can see them \u2013 I'm pretty sure that Egyptian cronies of the Mubarak family and members of that system felt quite comfortable depositing money in the UK.</p> <p>\"It's probably cosier to bring your money to your friends at an Arab bank in the City of London.</p> <p>\"[For the British government] Egypt's military generals are probably still a guarantor for safety whereas the new parliament and the new president are probably looked on with reservation.</p> <p>\"I would expect Britain is careful not to squarely go against the remnants of the old regime.\"</p> <p>Public records show a number of apparently unfrozen UK-based assets linked to Egyptian regime figures, some of whom are now in jail in Cairo for economic fraud. Gamal Mubarak was on a list published by the Treasury in March 2011 detailing 19 Egyptians whose assets were to be frozen.</p> <p>Yet MedInvest Associates, a London-based investment firm of which Gamal was a director, has never been frozen. Gamal subsequently stepped down as director and in February MedInvest was quietly dissolved voluntarily, potentially allowing its assets to be transferred abroad beyond the reach of investigators.</p> <p>Gamal Mubarak is also heavily linked with a \u00a310m London home round the corner from Harrods department store.</p> <p>The Knightsbridge house is named as Mubarak's place of address in his company filings for MedInvest and listed as the Mubarak family home on the birth certificate of Gamal's daughter, born in London in 2010.</p> <p>But the property has not been frozen for investigation. Gamal is now in jail in Cairo, awaiting verdict on money laundering charges.</p> <p>Another figure on the Treasury's sanctions list has actually been allowed to open a new business in the UK. Naglaa el-Ghazarley, wife of former tourism and housing minister Ahmed el-Maghrabi \u2013 now serving a five-year jail sentence in Egypt for corruption \u2013 registered Essential Designs by Nejla last November, almost eight months after the UK promised to freeze her assets.</p> <p>The company's registered address in Chelsea also remains unfrozen. Tim Daniel, a lawyer specialising in asset recovery, said it was \"extraordinary\" that someone on the sanctions list could begin trading in the UK in this way.</p> <p>Judge Assem el-Gohari, the official in Egypt's ministry of justice responsible for tracing stolen funds, insists that he has challenged the UK authorities over their inaction, but was told in response that British investigators need more information to proceed.</p> <p>\"The British government is obliged by law to help us but it doesn't want to make any effort at all to recover the money. It just says: Give us evidence. Is that reasonable?</p> <p>\"We're in Egypt. How can we search for money in the UK? We believe the UK has breached international law and the anti-corruption agreements.\"</p> <p>Alistair Burt, minister for the Middle East and North Africa, denied Britain was not doing enough. \"We are working closely with their [Egypt's] authorities to identify and restrain assets their courts have identified as stolen,\" he said.</p> <p>\"It is crucial that the recovery and return of stolen assets is lawful. It is simply not possible for the UK to deprive a person of their assets and return them to an overseas country in the absence of a criminal conviction and confiscation order.</p> <p>\"We are therefore working closely with the appropriate authorities in Egypt to help them understand the legal process and how to work with it effectively and efficiently, including through expert-to-expert contacts in the UK and Cairo, the signing of a memorandum of understanding on intelligence sharing with the Egyptian financial intelligence unit, and increased police-to-police intelligence co-operation.\"</p> <p>Andy Slaughter, the shadow justice minister, said the evidence unearthed by the investigation showed that the UK government is \"effectively turning a blind eye\" to money stolen from the Egyptian people.</p> <p>\"Twenty minutes work by officials could have identified very substantial assets belonging to the old Egyptian regime. We used to be a place where international justice was seen to be done, and now we're turning a blind eye to every type of abuse,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Egypt's Stolen Billions will be broadcast on BBC2's Newsnight</em> <em>on Monday and on the BBC Arabic channel for the next two weeks </em></p> <h2>Sanctions and the law</h2> <p>The international community uses financial sanctions to try to shape the behaviour of specific regimes and individuals, as well as to stop funds from slipping into terrorist hands and prevent those suspected of economic fraud from squirrelling their fortunes away beyond public reach.</p> <p>Sanctions are imposed at a supranational level by either the UN (under Article 41 of the UN charter) or the EU (under Article 11 of the Treaty of the EU), though in practice each nation retains its own set of legal procedures when it comes to setting and implementing sanctions and the energy with which they go about their task often depends on political will.</p> <p>With its huge financial centre and valuable property market, London is a global magnet for international assets, meaning that the British authorities are regularly called into action when sanctions are applied.</p> <p>The UK foreign office is responsible for setting overall policy regarding sanctions while a dedicated unit in the Treasury implements the sanctions themselves \u2013 usually by contacting private financial institutions like banks and investment funds and asking them to freeze relevant assets.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/sanctionsconlist.pdf\" title=\"\">official British sanctions list</a> (pdf) is constantly updated and currently runs to 74 pages, listing everyone from al-Qaida fugitives to Congolese warlords and North Korean politicians.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012.

  "<p>Barack Obama has a foe more potent than Mitt Romney. It is the younger version of himself. Scaremongering about a Republican candidate who will send America back to the age of black and white television will not be enough. Whining about the economic hand he was dealt will not do it either. George W Bush is history. His legacy \u2013 two wars and an global economic crash \u2013 may indeed have been so toxic that it would have taken all four of his successor's years to overcome, no matter who he was, but as we have charted in these columns, that is not the whole truth either.

He passed a tepid version of healthcare reform, but a reform nonetheless; he pulled out of Iraq; he prevented another great depression; he saved the car industry in Detroit. These are no mean achievements. But how much paler is the reality of power than the promise of it. As candidate, his rhetorical ambition knew no bounds, promising not just to change politics but energise a new generation. These people are now profoundly<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/01/barack-obama-fails-to-inspire-voters\" title=\"\"> de-energised</a>. If they are motivated, the urge is negative. They see, all too clearly, whom they are going to vote against \u2013 a rich man who will undo all the modest social democratic gains of the last four years, who as commander in chief will be drawn into a war with Iran. But they cannot as yet see whom they will be voting for.</p> <p>The candidate in 2008 was a brilliant electoral device. He was all things to all men \u2013 and women. Liberals saw in him a genuine radical. Centrists thought he could break the power of the Washington lobby. Climate change campaigners thought America would lead the search for Kyoto's successor, not block it. Everyone prayed Obama would restore America's tarnished global image, so that it could lead by force of argument rather than force of arms. Of course, this Icarus flew so high he was doomed to crash. But remember, too, the scale of his ambition. He set the bar for his leadership no lower than Abraham Lincoln himself.</p> <p>It has been such a bitter, personalised campaign that no candidate has even thought of making a major policy speech. It has all been attack ads, and there is much more to come. This week Obama will have to do better. He must provide people with a real reason, other than fear, to vote him in again.</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne has declared his support for a new runway in the south east of England, possibly at Heathrow airport, and is expected to establish a commission to try and build cross-party support for the controversial move.</p> <p>In a strategy agreed with the Liberal Democrats, the coalition will uphold its agreement which rules out extra runways at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in this parliament.</p> <p>Government sources cited the Turner review on pensions and the Browne review on university tuition fees \u2013 both established by the Labour government \u2013 as examples of commissions set up to find agreement on contentious issues. If agreement was reached, a new runway could be built after the 2015 election.</p> <p>The move is a reaction to comments from Tim Yeo, the former Tory environment minister, who challenged the prime minister last week to perform a U-turn and support a third runway. Yeo, who changed his position on Heathrow in March, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9501875/Heathrow-expansion-A-third-runway-must-be-cleared-for-take-off.html\" title=\"\">taunted Cameron by writing in the Daily Telegraph</a>: \"The prime minister must ask himself whether he is man or mouse.\"</p> <p>As MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Monday for a two week pre-conference session, Osborne outlined the government's new thinking on aviation. The chancellor told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"We need more runway capacity in the south east of England. Then there's a question of where it should go \u2013 Heathrow, new estuary airport, Stansted, Gatwick. People have lots of different options. What I would say is let's examine all the options; let's do it ... now. Let's make sure we can try and create a political consensus.\"</p> <p>Osborne added that, as MP for a Cheshire constituency near Manchester airport, he understood concerns about expanding airports. But he added: \"You've got, as a nation, [to] be able to overcome those and make a sensible decision about where that extra runway capacity in the south east should be. What we're going to get ... is a decision that we need new runway capacity and then we're going to seek to achieve a political agreement across the parties on where that should be.\"</p> <p>The chancellor's approach is designed to hold the coalition together. The Lib Dems are adamantly opposed to a third runway at Heathrow, unlike Osborne and other senior Tories who believe the case for extra capacity is now overwhelming.</p> <p>Osborne is also looking to ensure that the transport secretary Justine Greening can remain in the cabinet, if not in the same job. Greening, the MP for Putney, said last week that it would be difficult for her to remain in the cabinet if a third runway were built at Heathrow because she still stands by the Tory pledge at the last election to oppose such a move.</p> <p>As the government's main political strategist, Osborne also hopes to put pressure on Labour. Ed Miliband came close to resigning as energy and climate change secretary when Gordon Brown insisted on pressing ahead with a third runway. Labour is now opposed to this.</p> <p>Greening published an aviation strategy document in July which included proposals on emissions, noise levels, night flights and regional airports. An anticipated call for evidence on hub capacity has yet to appear, leaving the new commission to focus on capacity in the south-east.</p> <p>William Hague confirmed that no decision on an extra runway would be made in this parliament. In an interview on Sky News, the foreign secretary sounded less convinced than Osborne of the need for another runway.</p> <p>\"Everyone will remember that we very clearly said \u2013 both coalition parties said in the election campaign \u2013 that that's one thing that we wouldn't do and I think it is very important to keep to election promises.</p> <p>\"Sometimes circumstances change so radically, as everybody understands, that that's not possible, but in this case these circumstances have not changed so radically, so it is important to stick to that election promise. It's important to make sure we make the right decision about this and to study all the options, and that is what the government is now going to do.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats are still expected to fight the next election on a ticket opposed to a third runway at Heathrow. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/28/nick-clegg-heathrow-third-runway\" title=\"\">In a Guardian interview last week</a> Nick Clegg said it was important to preserve the \"hub\" capacity of Heathrow. But he said this could be achieved by diverting thousands of flights to London's three other airports to free up space for \"hub\" flights into Heathrow.</p> <p>It was reported on Sunday that a mystery consortium is drawing up plans for a new, four-runway airport close to Heathrow. The unnamed group of British businesses has commissioned a \"world-leading infrastructure firm\" to assess potential sites to the west and north of London which could rival \u2013 or even replace \u2013 Heathrow, according to the Independent on Sunday.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012. It originally stated that Greening was due to publish an aviation strategy document soon, but it has, in fact, already been published. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/eurozone-brink-double-dip-recession-gdp\" title=\"\">latest growth figures across Europe</a> prove that the push for austerity has been a dismal failure. In Britain it may take years to recover from the double dip recession. The alternative push for stimulus spending, however, has to go beyond mere investment. While infrastructure projects are important for employment in the short run, they do not provide the vision for change needed to transform European economies so they can face future technological, environmental and economic challenges. Indeed, the countries that are growing at double digit rates are not only spending, but also have ambitious visions for the direction of public investment.</p> <p>In the last decade and a half China, which has grown at an annual average of 10%, has increased its spending on research and development by 170%. Its five-year plan (2011-15) <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/02/us-china-economy-investment-idUSTRE6B16U920101202\" title=\"\">aims to invest $1.5tn</a> (5% of GDP) in strategic new, mainly \"green\", industries: energy-saving and environmentally friendly technologies, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, and alternative-fuel cars. It cannot be argued anymore that its growth path is based on low wages and imitation; it is becoming an innovation leader, and wages are rising as a result.</p> <p>Similarly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16332115\" title=\"\">Brazil, which grew by 7.5% in 2010</a>, recently announced a fiscal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/10393441\" title=\"\">stimulus package of $66bn</a>, aimed at modernising its infrastructure. But Brazil fully understands that infrastructure is not enough, and its active innovation policy \u2013 led by its state investment bank, BNDES \u2013 is rendering it an international leader in renewable energy and biotechnology. It spent over $5.3bn on clean technology between 2010-2011, and in biotechnology it has focused on the risky \"death valley\" phase (between having the concept, and full testing and approval) in which many firms fail due to lack of private finance.</p> <p>Indeed, across the world state investment banks are focusing on innovation. In China, investments by the China Development Bank (CDB) are the main source of its success in solar power. Chinese solar manufacturers have become large international players, able to slash the cost of solar photovoltaic panels so quickly that some believe this access to credit is the reason behind the <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/cleantech/chart-the-death-spiral-of-solar-bankruptcies-counting/\" title=\"\">bankruptcies of solar companies</a> in the US and Europe.</p> <p>In the west, when government investments have strategic direction, there is immediate worry about the public sector's inability to pick winners. In Britain there has been talk of setting up an investment bank out of the ashes of RBS to direct spending on infrastructure. But an investment bank is needed not simply to invest, but to do so in areas that the private sector is not willing to go. This requires making choices. And many, even on the left, are worried that a \"public\" bank will be less able to make those choices than a private one.</p> <p>The real problem is not private versus public decisions. The more you talk down the state's ability to be a productive, active agent in the economy, the less bold it is, the less it is capable of attracting the brightest minds, who prefer to work in lucrative parts of the private sector. The large poster that welcomes visitors to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills office in London exudes the state's irrelevance: \"Great Britain: low corporation tax and less regulation\". Yet investment remains low. When instead there is vision and excitement in the public sector, jobs there are filled by top minds \u2013 and business responds. Indeed, the computer revolution was led by a US public agency, Darpa, which managed to attract some of the country's best scientific minds \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/about/history/history.aspx\" title=\"\">invented the internet</a> in the process.</p> <p>The excitement around BNDES in Brazil, and its confident and visionary role in planning for strategic new industries, has allowed it to attract top financial economists, and it is run by two international experts in the economics of innovation. Its bold risk-taking has allowed it to make record profits in productive, rather than purely speculative, investments. In 2010 its return on equity was an astounding 21% (reinvested by the treasury in areas like health and education), while that of the World Bank's equivalent organisation \u2013 the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development \u2013 was -2% (that of the CDB was 9%).</p> <p>In Europe, the equivalent institution would be the European Investment Bank. Indeed, immediately after the crisis the EIB undertook an initial bout of counter-cyclical lending. It increased approved loans from \u20ac890m in 2007 to \u20ac4.2bn in 2009. This declined dramatically by 2011 to \u20ac703m, mainly due to worries about the bank's AAA credit rating, as&#xa0;well as lack of consensus between European Union countries on how active the EIB should be. And, as has been <a href=\"http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2012/07/22/what-the-eib-makes-the-ecb-unmakes-the-latest-from-the-greek-front/\" title=\"\">recently argued by the Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis</a>, what the EIB gives with one hand (for example, financing for Greek small and medium-sized businesses), the European Central Bank takes with the other. In the end, it is more fear of the rating agencies and a lack of solidarity between countries that dictates growth policy in Europe.</p> <p>Of course, we need both general stimulus spending \u2013 in areas such as healthcare, education and infrastructure \u2013 and directed investment in strategic new technologies and sectors. But the global economic race will be won mainly on the latter, and the winners will earn more profits for welfare programmes. Indeed, as has been shown in research by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the investment multiplier is higher when public investment is directed to growth areas rather than just \"digging ditches\" and filling them up again. But direction requires vision, courage, and solidarity \u2013 all casualties of&#xa0;the latest European crisis.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>EDF has been holding talks with China about sharing the soaring cost of building \u00a310bn worth of new reactors at Hinkley Point, Somerset.</p> <p>The move underlines growing pressure on the French company's internal finances and has reignited a fractious debate about Communist state-run businesses playing a critical role in sensitive western energy infrastructure.</p> <p>The overtures to Beijing's state corporations \u2013 as well as approaches to Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds \u2013 come as EDF faces growing investment demands in France and the UK that have sent debt levels rocketing to \u20ac39.7bn (\u00a330bn).</p> <p>\"We have always said we were open to the idea of other partners investing in the project. As we approach our final investment decision, it is right to consider funding options including seeking additional partners,\" said an EDF spokesman.</p> <p>\"Plans to build new reactors are advancing well and have achieved a level of maturity to make it attractive to potential new investors,\" he added. \"However, it is too early to say anything about the outcome [of these talks].\"</p> <p>EDF Energy owns and operates eight of the UK's existing 10 nuclear power stations and has plans to expand two of these sites, Hinkley Point and Sizewell, Suffolk, by building four new nuclear reactors.</p> <p>The company plans to make a final investment decision on Hinkley Point C by the end of this year but remains upbeat about the scheme, on which it has already spent \u00a31bn.</p> <p>While EDF would not publicly confirm it, well-placed industry sources say the group, which has a 20% partner in Centrica already, has been in discussions with China's State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation (SNPTC) and China Guangdong Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC). These are the rival state-owned companies that have already teamed up with two Western consortiums vying to buy the Horizon Nuclear Power company from RWE and E.ON. Horizon owns sites at Wylfa, on Anglesey, and Oldbury, South Gloucestershire.</p> <p>SNPTC is in a bidding team with Areva, the French engineering company that is already working with EDF in Somerset, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/20/china-uk-nuclear-power-plants\" title=\"\">talks have already been held by Chinese officials with the UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change</a> about independently developing other nuclear sites in Britain such as Hartlepool in the north-east of England.</p> <p>Mark Pritchard, a Conservative MP and member of the parliamentary joint national security committee, said any Chinese involvement in EDF's new nuclear plans would raise concerns on a number of fronts and could even require a direct UK government involvement through some kind of golden share.</p> <p>\"If there is significant Chinese financing, then the coalition government should consider retaining a controlling stake,\" he said. \"There would also need to be national security safeguards over any Chinese design and build.\"</p> <p>\"Restrictions should also apply as to the number of Chinese workers who could work on UK-based nuclear projects. Major nuclear infrastructure projects are an opportunity to create tens of thousands of new jobs for UK workers.\"</p> <p>Nick Butler, a former energy adviser to Number 10, has earlier raised concerns about Chinese involvement in any potential Horizon bids. In a recent FT blog, he wrote: \"They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, EDF last month revealed its debt levels had jumped nearly 20% in the first half of the year, partly because of \u20ac10bn in new spending commitments demanded by the French government on local reactors in the aftermath of the Fukushima atomic crisis in March last year.</p> <p>The energy company \u2013 majority owned by the French state \u2013 is also facing mounting cost overruns and delays on its planned new reactor scheme at Flamanville in northern France.</p> <p>A final green light for Hinkley Point C depends on receiving an acceptable \"strike price\", agreed with the government, that would guarantee future returns.</p> <p>EDF insists this strike price \u2013 seen by critics as unfair subsidy \u2013 will be lower than the \u00a3140 per megawatt hour that is roughly the current cost of producing offshore wind power.</p>",
  "<p>GCSE exams should be \"thoroughly overhauled\" to tackle declining standards and the slump in England's ranking in global education league tables, the chief schools inspector has said.</p> <p>Sir Michael Wilshaw, head of the schools inspectorate Ofsted, called on the education secretary Michael Gove to use the row over this summer's GCSE results as a catalyst to examine whether the whole system is \"credible enough\".</p> <p>Thousands of pupils received Ds in GCSE English this summer on marks that would have a earned a C earlier this year, after exam boards changed grade boundaries following an order from the exams regulator Ofqual to end grade inflation. Schools reacted furiously to the results and many are considering legal action.</p> <p>Wilshaw told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"This is a really good opportunity for our system and the secretary of state to look at our examination system and ask whether it is rigorous enough, whether it's credible enough, whether what's happened over the last few years in terms of resits, early entries and the modular approach to examination is actually raising standards.</p> <p>\"One of the worries I have and I know other people have, is that our standards are falling in relation to other countries in the rest of the world.</p> <p>\"English is the world language, it is the business language. We know that we have fallen from seventh in reading to 25th in the world. In maths, from seventh to 28th. That is not good enough. We've got to look at what is happening in the rest of the world.\"</p> <p>Labour has called for Gove to explain to MPs when the Commons resumes on Monday exactly what happened with the GCSEs. The Commons cross party education committee is poised to announce its own inquiry this week.</p> <p>Stephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, blamed the exam grading row on the education secretary, saying it was unfair to change the grade boundaries in the middle of the year.</p> <p>He told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: \"If you were assessed in January you could get a grade C. The same quality of work, maybe even slightly better work, assessed in May and you would have got a D. That cannot be right. I'm all in favour of rigour, I'm in favour of making sure these are tough exams, but you can't change the boundaries in the middle of the year.</p> <p>\"We need a full inquiry into what went wrong, we need to make sure this doesn't happen again next year, which is why I have suggested the select committee on education should take a detailed look at that. But before then, we need to try and avert there being legal action \u2026 let's try to resolve this in the next few days.\"</p> <p>Wilshaw signalled a toughening of Ofsted's inspections, warning that it was no longer acceptable for schools to achieve just a \"satisfactory\" grade. Ofsted is replacing its \"satisfactory\" grading with \"requires improvement\" from this week. A third of schools are ranked satisfactory or below and the chief inspector said they were not good enough.</p> <p>\"The teaching's often not good enough, the leadership often isn't good enough, and the progress and the outcomes of children aren't good enough,\" he said.</p> <p>Wilshaw also said that in future schools would get 24 hours' notice of an inspection, rather than 48 hours. \"There'll be a day-before notice rather than the two-day notice now because really we want to see schools as they normally are.\"</p> <p>National GCSE results for all subjects in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, published last month, revealed 69.4% of exams were given at least a C grade, down 0.4 percentage points on last summer. It is the first time the A*-C pass rate has fallen in the 24-year history of GCSEs.</p> <p>Ofqual investigated after headteachers said that between 10,000 and 67,000 pupils who sat exams in GCSE English and GCSE English language in England and Wales in June had been wrongly graded, meaning some could have missed out on sixth-form and college places.</p> <p>But the regulator concluded that exams taken by other pupils in January had been too generous, triggering June's adjustments. It ruled out re-marking the GCSEs but has made provisions for students who want to re-sit their exams before Christmas free of charge.</p>",
  "<p>The last decade saw the end of cheap oil, the magic growth ingredient for the global economy after the second world war. This summer's increase in maize, wheat and soya bean prices \u2013 the third spike in the past five years \u2013 suggests the era of cheap food is also over.</p> <p>Price increases in both oil and food provide textbook examples of market forces. Rapid expansion in the big emerging markets, especially China, has led to an increase in demand at a time when there have been supply constraints. For crude, these have included the war in Iraq, the embargo imposed on Iran, and the fact that some of the older fields are starting to run dry before new sources of crude are opened up.</p> <p>The same demand dynamics affect food. It is not just that the world's population is rising by 1% a year. Nor is it simply that China has been growing at 9% a year on average; it is that consumers in the big developing countries have developed an appetite for higher protein western diets. Meat consumption is rising in China, India and Brazil, and since it takes 7kg of grain to produce 1kg of beef (and 4kg to produce 1kg of pork), this is adding to global demand.</p> <p>Farmers have been getting more efficient, increasing the yields of land under production, but this has been offset by two negative factors: policies in the US and the EU that divert large amounts of corn for biofuels and poor harvests caused by the weather.</p> <p>If the World Bank's projections are anything like accurate, further massive productivity gains from agriculture are going to be needed over the next two decades. There will be an extra 70m mouths to feed every year, which will result in a 50% increase in demand for food by 2030. Meanwhile, the amount of arable land per person will continue its long-run downward trend.</p> <p>The extent of this challenge has been highlighted by the extreme drought in the US this year. Failure of the maize harvest \u2013 down by more than 100m tonnes on what was expected \u2013 has had a knock-on impact on wheat, which has not been affected by the lack of rain. Prices of both crops have jumped by $100 a tonne this summer. The latest data from the World Bank showed that food prices rose 10% between June and July and have now exceeded the previous peak in early 2011.</p> <p>It will take time for these increases to have their full impact on consumers. In the short run, the cost of meat will not be affected because there is glut caused by livestock owners slaughtering their herds in order to save money on expensive feed. But by the end of the year, food will be dearer.</p> <p>Central banks are unlikely to tighten policy in response to higher inflation, since the increase is seen as an external shock that will have a depressing effect on the spending power of consumers. They should not, however, assume that the spike will be a one-off, since grain stocks are at such low levels that bad harvests in 2013 would see rocketing prices, probably accompanied by panic-buying, export bans and food riots.</p> <p>A recent report from Oxfam said the US should expect further severe droughts in the coming decades. \"The US experienced $14bn-dollar disasters in 2011 \u2013 an historical record \u2013 including a blizzard, tornadoes, floods, a hurricane, a tropical storm, drought and heatwaves, and wildfires.\" The current year has already seen wildfires, a windstorm, heatwaves in much of the country and the most severe drought in half a century.</p> <p>This seems to be an apt moment for the west to reassess the wisdom of biofuels. The US ethanol distilleries used 120m tonnes of maize in 2011 and there have already been calls from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation for the reduced maize crop to be used for human food. There is also growing political opposition in the US to the country's Renewable Fuel Standard, which mandates 15.2bn gallons of biofuels for 2012, of which 13.4bn gallons can come from corn-based ethanol. Unsurprisingly, livestock and poultry producers have been at the forefront of calls for the mandate to be suspended.</p> <p>The whole point about biofuels was that they were supposed to be a cost-free and a pain-free way for developed nations to show that they were responding to climate change. Rising crop yields meant there would be enough grain left over each year to turn into ethanol, and this would mean western consumers could do their bit to save the planet without in any way compromising their living patterns. That now looks like a highly questionable assumption.</p> <p>So what happens next? A lasting solution to the food question will require either action on the demand side, action on the supply, or more likely both. The two obvious ways of limiting demand are to check population growth or to change dietary habits so that meat consumption is reduced. Neither is going to be easy to achieve.</p> <p>On the supply side, the short-term response should be to find alternatives to biofuels. Longer term, the hope is that the pressures of a rising population coupled with the incentives provided by rising food prices lead to a second green revolution that will dramatically increase yields in those parts of the world \u2013 such as sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 where they are currently low. One of the few beneficial impacts of high commodity prices is that farmers will be able to afford to buy fertilisers for their land.</p> <p>A recent study by Fidelity looked at some of the other recent developments to boost food supply, including precision agriculture \u2013 the use of high technology to apply the optimum amounts of seed, water and fertiliser for maximum efficiency \u2013 and a wider use of biotechnology and GM crops. The report also highlighted what is known as \"fast food\" from animal cells, a process by which scientists \"create artificial meat by delivering an electric charge to the animal muscle cells in a mixture of amino acids, which causes the cells to multiply\".</p> <p>Given the predicted growth in consumption in developing countries, Fidelity says this could become an \"environmentally acceptable option\" as traditional meat becomes more expensive. Whether this approach is \"environmentally acceptable\" remains to be seen. The Fidelity report does, however, clarify one point, namely that hard choices have to be made.</p> <p>The current assumption seems to be that the world can have a rising population, ever-higher per capita meat consumption, devote less land to food production to help hit climate change targets and eschew the advances in science that might increase yields. This is the stuff of fantasy. It is possible to have more intensive farming using the full range of technological breakthroughs in order to feed a bigger, meat-hungry population. Or it is possible to have lower yields from a more organic approach to feed a smaller population eating less meat. But not both.</p>",

Last week, Downing Street insisted it was sticking to the coalition policy not to add a new runway, despite intense pressure from the business sector and Tory backbenches to reconsider.</p> <p>Osborne said new planning legislation would be brought before parliament in the next two weeks.</p> <p>\"We will have a specific piece of legislation published next week so that government can use the low interest rates we have earned by being tough on the deficit to underwrite construction projects including housing,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked if this would mean developers would be allowed to build on green belt land, Osborne said: \"We published our national planning policy framework in March and we are not preparing to tear that up.</p> <p>\"But if you look for example at Cambridge, they have been pretty smart about swapping some bits of the green belt for other bits \u2013 in other words allowing some development on the green belt if you bring in new pieces of land into the green belt.</p> <p>\"Those powers already exist but are not widely used. I would like to see more,\" he said.</p> <p>Planning policy was thought to be a settled issue after the government backed down on plans to loosen planning rules earlier this year following a campaign by the National Trust.</p> <p>Councils are drawing up new local development plans to comply with the national planning policy framework (NPPF) by next April.</p> <p>Under plans being considered by ministers, local authorities may no longer be required to hold a public inquiry if green belt land loses its protected status.</p> <p>England's green belt covers over 6,000 sq miles of countryside around towns and cities to prevent urban sprawl.</p> <p>This week's new bill will enable the government to guarantee up to \u00a340bn of private sector investment in infrastructure.</p> <p>Treasury insiders said they were already involved in talks with 30 companies over the proposed projects, including proposals for the \u00a3600m Mersey Gateway project, a six-lane toll bridge between Widnes and Runcorn.</p> <p>A further announcement, also this week, is expected to set out plans for guaranteeing construction of new homes, with guarantees worth up to \u00a310bn.</p> <p>This will be followed by an economy bill which will set out further help including more planning reforms.</p> <p>The legislation will be fast tracked in order to ensure that detailed discussions with commercial parties can take place as soon as possible. It is expected to receive royal assent by the end of October.</p> <p>Osborne said the low level of bank lending was one of the economy's key weaknesses, and also proposed a \"small business bank\" to bring together existing schemes to boost lending to small businesses.</p> <p>The prime minister, David Cameron, is expected to announce new measures to stimulate the housing market on Thursday.</p> <p>Osborne's plans are likely to be bitterly fought inside the cabinet, with senior Liberal Democrats and the communities secretary, Eric Pickles \u2013 who negotiated the peace deal over the national planning policy framework \u2013 reportedly opposed to further changes.</p> <p>The chancellor declined to say whether the announcement was an acknowledgement that the government's economic strategy was not working. \"They are difficult times for the British economy, difficult times for the world, but our economy is healing, jobs are being created. It is taking time but there is no easy route to a magical recovery,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This country faces a big question about this country's future role in the world. I am determined that we will be in the right place at the right time to ensure that we are one of the western economies that thrives in this new world,\" he said.</p> <p>Osborne also refused to say whether he would give up his role as the Tories' senior political strategist \u2013 despite demands from backbenchers that he concentrate on the economy.</p> <p>The Tory MP for Northampton South, Brian Binley, called this weekend for Osborne to stand down from his job to concentrate on winning the next election.</p> <p>\"I am 110% focused on the economy \u2013 any changes to the cabinet will be announced by the prime minister,\" Osborne said.</p> <p>Cameron has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/02/david-cameron-cut-through-dither\" title=\"\">signalled the start of his political fightback</a> by vowing to \"cut through the dither\" that he says is holding Britain back.</p> <p>As MPs prepare to return to Westminster on Monday following the summer break, the prime minister promised a series of high-profile initiatives to get the country moving again and breathe new life into the flagging economy.</p> <p>His comments will be seen as a riposte to discontented Tory MPs who have attacked his leadership during the recess, with one senior backbencher suggesting he was a political \"mouse\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2196948/Cameron-roars-Im-mouse-launches-battle-plan-revive-ailing-economy.html\" title=\"\">Writing in the Mail on Sunday</a>, Cameron made clear he was ready to take on his critics \u2013 bringing forward controversial measures to boost growth by relaxing planning rules.</p> <p>He said the country could not afford the \"paralysis\" that caused new housing developments to be held up by entrenched local opposition and lengthy planning inquiries.</p> <p>\"A familiar cry goes up: 'Yes we want more housing, but no to every development \u2013 and not in my back yard.'

There is an alternative economic policy.\"</p> <p>Labour said the government's new proposals to stimulate growth showed a lack of ideas.</p> <p>Chris Leslie, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said the chancellor was desperate to cling on to his failing plan, regardless of the long-term damage the IMF had warned it risked doing to the economy.</p> <p>\"We will look closely at the details of any further changes to the planning system, including what happens to protections for the green belt. But this will not address the real reasons why construction has contracted in the last year, such as slashed public investment in housing and the lack of confidence and demand in the economy.</p> <p>\"What we need is a change of course and real action now to boost jobs and growth, including genuinely bringing forward infrastructure projects, a temporary cut in VAT and tax breaks for small firms taking on extra workers.\"</p>",
