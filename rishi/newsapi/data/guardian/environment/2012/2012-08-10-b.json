  "<h2>Gulliver's Travels, Edinburgh</h2> <p>Romanian director Silviu Purcarete put on a very showy Faust at the 2009 Edinburgh International festival \u2013 a spectacular and seductive performance of Goethe's morality tale with more than 100 actors \u2013 and returns to give Jonathan Swift's satire his devilish treatment. In fact, Swift's journey into human behavior \u2013 which also operates as a send-up of travellers' tall tales \u2013 should suit Purcarete, whose production will be very much guided by the musical score specially created by Belfast-born composer Shaun Davey. Aimed very much at an adult audience, the play explores themes of immigration and exile in an interpretation of the classic story that gave us such memorable creations as the island of Lilliput and its tiny inhabitants.</p> <p><strong><em>King's, Fri to 20 Aug</em></strong></p> <p><em>Lyn Gardner</em></p> <h2>2008: Macbeth, Edinburgh</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394508436\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344530853343/2008-Macbeth.-004.jpg\" alt=\"2008: Macbeth.\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2008: Macbeth.

Not everything is on a grandiose scale, but that's not to say that the impact can't be considerable \u2013 and such is the case with Watt, a hit for Dublin's Gate theatre and a show that reminds us that the great Samuel Beckett could be a bit of a joker. Written in France during the Nazi occupation, Watt tells the story of a man who goes into service for reasons that are obscure and remain so.

Or rather, who gets heard and who gets ignored? The old adage suggests that children should be seen and not heard, but they are given a voice in this experimental new piece created by Chris Goode, a theatre-maker of infinite talent and infinite compassion. Based on verbatim conversations with more than 30 children aged between eight and 10, and exploring such issues as being scared, getting lost and growing up, the piece offers a unique, first-hand perspective on what it's like being a child. The twist here is that the conversations have been transposed to adult characters and situations, creating a thought-provoking show that aims to take children very seriously indeed.</p> <p><strong><em>Traverse, Tue to 26 Aug</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Deborah Colker Dance Company: Tatyana, Edinburgh</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394508441\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/10/1344592534029/Tatyana-004.jpg\" alt=\"Tatyana\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tatyana.

  "<p>When you think of a Hollywood \"character actor\", he's usually the fat best friend, the odd-looking serial killer, or the surprise turncoat \u2013 he provides a foil for comedy, pathos and action. But rarely do character actors get to morph into A-list stars, which is what makes Jeremy Renner's success so refreshing. Renner, who boasts a similarly sexy, lopsided non-handsomeness as Daniel Craig, has a proven track record for elevating sidekick characters far above their intended station, a trait that makes his leading role as Aaron Cross in The Bourne Legacy one of the most highly anticipated action events of the summer.</p> <p>Renner's enviable knack for making a good guy bad (and a bad guy good) is the reason he's here in the first place. It was his lazily charming portrayal of a notorious serial killer in the indie film Dahmer which caught the eye of Kathryn Bigelow, who went on to cast him in the star-making The Hurt Locker. Not bad for a little-known character actor who'd been grinding at the Hollywood mill for the best part of 15 years.</p> <p>\"I don't really think there's much difference between a character actor and a leading man besides aesthetics,\" Renner says. Hugely jetlagged, he speaks in a slow, uncalculated drawl, without a hint of hesitancy that comes with the usual guarded A-list responses. \"So-called character actors usually have supporting roles, which means that you have less colours on the palette to paint a three-dimensional character. So the depth comes from them having had a life, and bringing that to these smaller roles. But with lead roles, like Aaron Cross, you still do that \u2013 it's just a bit easier.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kf0bhz5CUC8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kf0bhz5CUC8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kf0bhz5CUC8\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>Renner has certainly had a life. He was a jobbing actor for years before Bigelow gave him a golden ticket as the unhinged Sergeant William James, a role for which he was duly Oscar-nominated. His recent leading man status is the result of a body of work that made him the poster boy for twisted, multi-layered, morally ambiguous heroic villains. I first came across him in an episode of Joss Whedon's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Cztm9NE3pg\" title=\"\">Angel</a> from 2000, in which he played a sadistic vampire with a chilling signature stamp. He managed, as is his speciality, to infuse a cartoonish murderer with myriad shades of light and dark, an ink with which he's determined to stain every role.</p> <p>It's most prevalent in The Town, where he imbued a potentially two-dimensional supporting role of showy brutality with a meditation on the nature of loyalty. His intensity is never less than unforgettable, even if many of his films (The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, 12 And Holding) are not.</p> <p>\"Do I deliberately add moral ambiguity? Of course. If it's not in it, I put it in. Nobody wants to watch a good guy do good shit where nothing bad ever happens.\" It's clear this is a man for whom the study of characterisation is an art form. \"We respond to change, to complexity, to interesting storytelling. There is nothing new, from Greek mythology to Shakespeare to every romcom ever made, we're just reimagining the same 12 story plots over and over again \u2013 so what makes people keep watching and listening? It's all about the character. And when villains have empathy, there's your movie.\"</p> <p>Now a household name, Renner's ascent was the classic long, winding road of countless auditions, rejections and increasing poverty. It's presumably why the prospect of a fat paycheck is less alluring than the promise of a complex role, however small. \"Yes!\" he agrees. \"Put me in tights, put me in a dress, I don't care. I don't want to play a bad guy who doesn't have a bit of good in him.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394640163\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344852090480/Jeremy-Renner-in-The-Hurt-002.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker. Photograph: Allstar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is, perhaps, the privilege of the mentally staunch latecomer to become increasingly picky, not less. In an episode of comedian Marc Maron's WTF podcast, fellow late-bloomer Jon Hamm discussed the pursuit of a dream while nearing your mid-30s, and what it takes mentally to prepare yourself for the possibility that you might never make it.</p> <p>Renner nods. He can relate. Now 41, after a decade of cancellations and bit parts, he was living without electricity when The Hurt Locker landed in his lap.</p> <p>\"I was still struggling financially. I was living without any power and about as broke as broke gets. But I never thought about giving up, not even once. It just gives you more fuel for the fire, you know. And things turned out all right.\"</p> <p>All right is an understatement. Twice Oscar-nominated (for both The Hurt Locker and The Town), Renner has since served a thinking-action-man's apprenticeship, moving smoothly from The Avengers to an internship with old-hand Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol. And now, the denouement of his action adventures \u2013 The Bourne Legacy, a predictably stylish slice of relentlessly high-octane action that extrapolates on the ideas of identity and morality explored in the original series. Renner's steely, intelligent execution recalls the thrilling silent strength of a young Steve McQueen, his menacing presence a perfect fit for the role. The less surefooted of his peers might have hesitated to step into the Bourne/Damon shadow, but one benefit of late success is the wisdom to differentiate the bad from the good decisions \u2013 and Renner has no intention of mis-stepping now.</p> <p>\"If I'd been approached and asked to play Jason Bourne, it would have been a really easy 'no'. But this movie wasn't about filling Matt Damon's shoes.\" Renner is endearingly earnest now, determined to be clear on this point. He respects the sanctity of the franchise. \"It was a brand new canvas, and a brand new story. So the only pressure was to be able to perform in the style and physicality and ferocity of the action that had been established in the first three films. Because that is something that you cannot fake.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wyrtn53OpeU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wyrtn53OpeU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wyrtn53OpeU\">Reading this on mobile? Click here to view</a></p> <p>Renner first realised he was seriously famous in a series of (his words) \"pinch-me\" moments that began shortly after he was nominated for an Oscar for The Hurt Locker. \"One minute I'm homeless. The next I'm still homeless, but I'm in a tuxedo, on my way to the Oscars, stopping at a coffee shop to brush my teeth because I don't have running water. The next minute, Jack Nicholson, someone I've admired my entire life, is right in front of me saying my name. Then he's saying the names of two movies I did and I'm like, 'Jesus, all I wanted to do was be in a movie that would play in a big enough theatre that my family would get to see it. And now this.' What can I say? It's weird.\"</p> <p>Renner is irritated be the idea that people get into acting because they want to be famous. \"I know it's a cliche but I never wanted to be famous. I don't believe anybody wants to be famous.\" But now that he is, Renner has had to endure the usual scurrilous rumours, including the ones about him and his best friend, with whom he operates a successful real estate business. Renner sighs.</p> <p>\"I talked to some other friends of mine about the rumours when I first heard them. I said, 'Have you seen this?' and they were like, 'Dude, do you know how long that's been online?' Look up any actor and it's the second thing that comes up. So I have gay rumours \u2013 guess I've made it!\"</p> <p>Renner is charmingly candid \u2013 no media-trained platitudes or overly-supportive spew in sight. It's refreshing. When we talk about the pitfalls of fame, I mention the Kardashians and he doesn't hesitate to roll his eyes and make his disdain crystal clear. \"Oh, all those ridiculous people with zero talent who spend their lives making sure everyone knows their name. Those stupid, stupid people.\" He's also clear about what he considers a good, bad or painful interview.</p> <p>\"I know I have to do this stuff, and that's fine,\" he says, warming suddenly to the subject after a pretty languid half-hour. \"I get that it's part of the job. But when you have to answer stuff like, 'So if Hawkeye and Jason Bourne got in a fight, who would win?' you're like 'Next motherfucking question please!' I mean, come on man. I get that one a lot and, Jesus, it really does make me wonder what the hell people are reading this for.\"</p> <p>So he probably doesn't want to do the old describe-yourself-in-one-sentence end-of-interview game then? He grins. \"Sure, why not? Let's see \u2026 I'd rather give someone a smile than a punch in the face. That's me. Will that do?\"</p> <p>From the world's most complex A-list action star?

  "<p>Thomas Bernard McFeely could not have been more indignant. The Irish woman who has become the bane of his life, Theresa McGuinness, had challenged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/31/tom-mcfeely-declared-bankrupt-ireland\" title=\"\">his UK bankruptcy</a>. \"As a&#xa0;British citizen I have always objected to being forced into bankruptcy in a&#xa0;foreign jurisdiction,\" he informed the high court in London in June. \"I maintain this is a&#xa0;breach of my human rights.\"</p> <p>The foreign jurisdiction in question is Ireland, where hollow laughter greeted McFeely's sudden declaration of Britishness. After all, this is a man who once believed so fiercely in his Irishness that he fought in the IRA. He refused to recognise the British court that sentenced him in Northern Ireland in the 1970s, went on hunger strike and was prepared to die in the notorious H blocks in 1980. He later broke from Sinn F\u00e9in to join the League of Communist Republicans. Then he became a&#xa0;multimillionaire property developer.</p> <p>McFeely is bankrupt in Ireland now and will be&#xa0;out of business for 12 years. He is embroiled in&#xa0;numerous other court proceedings. His Victorian mansion on one of Dublin's most expensive avenues has been repossessed by the&#xa0;state. He says it's because he's a \"Nordie\"; that he is a victim of southern Irish prejudice against northerners, exacerbated by the global economic crisis. Few, however, see him as a&#xa0;victim. McFeely&#xa0;needn't worry about a roof over his head. His creditors, on the other hand, include&#xa0;several hundred people who bought apartments from him in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/26/priory-hall-ireland-raises-safety-fears-about-boom-developers\" title=\"\">Priory Hall</a>, a&#xa0;development deemed so dangerous it was evacuated with fire crews standing by.</p> <p>One Irish newspaper editorial recently said of McFeely that he lives on a \"different moral planet to the rest of us\". However, McFeely's planet is entirely recognisable as contemporary Ireland. His dramatic rise to wealth was encouraged and facilitated by successive governments of a&#xa0;Republic that each year commemorates the egalitarian ideals of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/21/easter-rising-dublin-1916\" title=\"\">1916 Easter Rising</a>. A&#xa0;Republic that is, according to the findings of the&#xa0;recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10156832\" title=\"\">Mahon tribunal</a>, endemically corrupt.</p> <p>McFeely's spectacular fall is mirrored by those of dozens of other developers and bankers, many of whom are queueing up to take advantage of more lenient bankruptcy laws in the UK and the US. Some have hidden billions abroad. Those paying for the excesses of the Celtic Tiger are ordinary Irish people, such as the former residents of Priory Hall, who took out inflated 20- or 30-year mortgages just before the bubble burst.</p> <p>Ireland, puffed up for a decade on the success of its peace process and the booming of its economy, is now bust, a land of zombie banks, ghost estates and empty monster hotels. Irish sovereignty, fought for by generations, has largely been forfeited to the so-called troika of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission.</p> <p>McFeely regards journalists as \"scum\". We meet at the headquarters of his main Irish company, Coalport. The building is on the edge of one of Dublin's grandest Georgian squares, but its large boardroom is as sparse as a prison cell. Grubby white walls, a basic table and chairs, a&#xa0;single poster of the Manhattan skyline. He takes the seat at the head of the table. He tells me he used to have antiques in the boardroom, but the sheriff took them. He fields calls. One, he says, is from a bank manager in Portugal, where he also has property problems.</p> <p>He was born in 1949, the eldest son in a&#xa0;Catholic family of 13, in Farkland, County Derry. His grandfather joined the British army and was injured in the first world war. His uncle was in the British marines and was killed in action. \"My&#xa0;grandmother never forgave the British army for taking her son. She was one hell of a lady. She&#xa0;had presence. Her daughter, my mother, was fairly militant.\" His father was a cattle dealer and more of a nationalist than a republican.</p> <p>McFeely says he will never forget the family home being wrecked during a raid by \"the B men\", members of the notorious unionist Special Constabulary. \"You'd have thought a bomb had hit the place.\" The \"B Specials\" were usually local&#xa0;men; the poet Seamus Heaney, also from Co&#xa0;Derry, called them \"<a href=\"http://www.cstone.net/~poems/twopohea.htm\" title=\"\">neighbours with guns</a>\".</p> <p>McFeely went to school in Derry. \"There were&#xa0;houses that were semi-derelict. It was primitive to say the least. I remember seeing roofs&#xa0;with the slates in a big hollow in the middle.\" He left school at 14 and worked with a farmer until he was old enough to get on to a building site. When he was 15, there was an election. He was sent out to vote for the nationalist candidate, but voted instead for the republican: \"I had a mind of my own.\" He served his time as a bricklayer, working from 7am till 9pm. \"Everything I've done, I was diligent at it. I&#xa0;was 'on the grip', paid by the brick.\"</p> <p>He went to England in 1968 and got work straight away. \"The 5th of October brought me back. It was typical of what I had learned all my life \u2013 we were a people to be put down in our own country,\" he says. He is referring to the violent attack by the police on a civil rights march through Derry. Discrimination was institutionalised in Northern Ireland but was particularly acute in Derry, shortly to be dubbed \"the capital city of injustice\" by Bernadette Devlin (then a leading civil rights campaigner and soon to become Britain's youngest ever woman MP). Housing was at the heart of it, with&#xa0;disenfranchised and unemployed nationalists living in poverty in desperately overcrowded slums.</p> <p>The Troubles had started, and McFeely pitched in: \"I would always have been up at the front of the riots where the hand-to-hand fighting went on.\" Though he has boasted of wielding a&#xa0;hatchet, he says he also listened to the speeches and particularly admired Devlin and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_McCann\" title=\"\">Eamonn McCann</a>. \"I was taken by the socialism. We were all downtrodden, even a lot of the Protestants, though they thought they were aristocracy.\" He&#xa0;stopped practising Catholicism in 1971. \"As&#xa0;Lenin said, it is the opium of the people.\"</p> <p>His activism quickly \"morphed into\" IRA involvement. \"It was a way of getting back at the state.\" Facing six months in jail, he went on the run in the Republic, but missed the action and his fiancee: \"I couldn't stay away.\" He got married and had two daughters. He set out to bomb the new dole office in Antrim, where he had bought a house. There was a chase, he was cornered, punched a policeman in the face, escaped, went on the run in the Republic, got caught, was jailed, escaped again. \"I went back to the north,\" he says, \"which was hot and heavy.\"</p> <p>He knew <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/martin-mcguinness\" title=\"\">Martin McGuinness</a>, who admits he led the IRA in Derry at the time of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/bloodysunday\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a> in 1972, but claims to have left by 1974. \"Martin was game. Martin was all right. It's not like him to leave in the middle of a good row,\" McFeely says with heavy sarcasm.</p> <p>McFeely was not, he says, involved in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2010/aug/24/claudy-bombing-report-priest-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">1972 bombing of Claudy</a>, a few miles from his childhood home. Nine people were killed, with no warnings given. \"But if I'd been there I would have planted the bombs. It is the reality of war. I&#xa0;only regret I wasn't able to do more.\"</p> <p>After carrying out an armed robbery on a post office, he and another IRA man took over a rural house, which was put under siege by the security forces. \"It was a bit wild west, to be honest. The idea was to go out and take as many of them out as possible.\" He shot a policeman (who survived) and when he eventually gave himself up, he expected to be shot dead. He got away with \"a&#xa0;fair decent beating\" but was sentenced to 26 years in 1977 by a judge who called him \"an extremely dangerous, intelligent and vicious young man\".</p> <p>McFeely puts his head in his hands when asked about his prison years. \"What do you tell? You got booted around, the screws would come in with drink on them and raid the cells, they'd spit on your food, you'd to walk naked, they'd set the dogs on you\u2026 There was fear, humiliation. I was in for the fight \u2013 I'd give the screws a damn good kicking.\"</p> <p>Screws were prison officers, mostly Protestants. He names one, \"the only evil man I ever met\", and says he is still glad he \"died a horrible death, a bomb under his car \u2013 he was mangled\". McFeely's violence meant he spent a lot of time \"on the boards\" (in solitary confinement).</p> <p>After the British ceased to recognise IRA members as political prisoners, McFeely was the OC (officer in command) of those who refused to wear the prison uniform and went \"on the blanket\". This escalated into the \"dirty protest\". The prisoners stopped washing; they urinated in their cells and smeared excrement on the walls. Soon the cells were crawling with maggots and prison officers wore gas masks against the stink.</p> <p>McFeely, described by another IRA prison leader as \"a very, very strong character\", was one of seven chosen to go on hunger strike, and was regarded as probably the most determined of them all. His face, gaunt, young, rakishly handsome back then, was on the posters that were carried on demonstrations in Belfast, Dublin and London. Halfway through, another prisoner described seeing McFeely: \"It was frightening. He looked like a skeleton with skin pulled over him.\" After 53 days, with one man about to die and rumours of a deal with the British, the hunger strike was called off. McFeely was blind, and furious. He vehemently opposed the decision.</p> <p>He is still full of rage about what happened. The deal was useless \u2013 the hunger strike had failed. When a new one began, the leadership refused his offer to go on it. \"I had no role after that.\" The demoralisation was \"absolutely terrible\". Violence inside the prison and out on the streets continued. Ten men died on the hunger strike. Along with another ex-hunger striker, Tommy McKearney, McFeely split with Sinn F\u00e9in to set up&#xa0;the League of Communist Republicans.</p> <p>Essie Kealing was a working-class hero. She lived in a flat in a complex that had been built for Dublin's poor by one of the 1916 revolutionaries. The flats were sold in the 1970s and Kealing led an eight-year rent strike to stop the landlord from evicting the tenants. In 1999, when she was 76 and had lived in her flat for 40 years, she received several visits from the new landlord, who attempted to persuade her to move out in terms that can be guessed at from her description of him as a \"rough merchant\". This was Tom McFeely, 10&#xa0;years after his release from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_%28HM_Prison%29\" title=\"\">Long Kesh</a> prison.</p> <p>Though he had not recognised the court, McFeely had appealed against his sentence and was released in 1989. His marriage had broken up. He moved to Dublin. He likes to tell the story of his first night, sleeping in his small car, almost penniless. Hired initially by other former IRA prisoners, he went back \"on the grip\", intent upon building up his fortune brick by brick.</p> <p>He was just in time to avail himself of minister <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1draig_Flynn\" title=\"\">Padraig Flynn</a>'s new light-touch regulatory regime which allowed \"self-certification\" of compliance with the law by architects, engineers and builders. Local authorities were empowered to carry out inspections, but in reality the pace of building was soon such that they lacked the resources to do so in more than a token number of cases.</p> <p>Successive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il\" title=\"\">Fianna F\u00e1il</a> governments laid out a&#xa0;range of tax breaks and schemes which, along with low interest rates and a striking absence of regulation, were designed to encourage speculators. A government minister praised the Irish \"frontiersmen\" mentality. The New York Times said Dublin had become known as \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/business/worldbusiness/01irish.html\" title=\"\">something of the Wild West of European finance</a>\". Many of those who profited bankrolled the party. McFeely says he did not. \"But if I'd been asked, would I have done it? Yes. I don't know anybody with a halo.\"</p> <p>Within a couple of years, McFeely had enough money to buy a pub back home in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungiven\" title=\"\">Dungiven</a>. He&#xa0;had no fear of authority. His modus operandi, if there was a finding against him in one court, was to appeal to a higher one. There were long-running legal battles with other major developers. \"I pushed it all in front of me. I&#xa0;never&#xa0;kept money,\" he says.</p> <p>He didn't part with it readily, either. Following a&#xa0;Criminal Assets Bureau investigation in 2006, he had to pay out more than \u20ac8m in unpaid taxes, dating back to his arrival in the Republic. The following year, Coalport was the subject of no fewer than eight high court proceedings. He took out a&#xa0;loan of \u20ac10m for his house, the former German embassy, but stopped paying the mortgage. In 2009 he was ordered to repay \u20ac6.2m to a bank, as well as a&#xa0;further revenue payment of \u20ac580,000.</p> <p>McFeely's companies built houses, apartments and commercial units all over Ireland, as well as in England. He maintained the tradition of employing ex-prisoners. An absence of building experience was not a barrier. During the boom, he freely admits, \"Everything was done in a rush. The attitude was get it up, get it off, get on to the next job. Come back and finish it later.\"</p> <p>In 2002, Theresa McGuinness liked what she saw of McFeely's plans for a small development in County Dublin and paid a cash deposit of \u20ac35,000 on a house. It was a decision that would come to dominate her life for at least the following decade. Within two years she was suing McFeely. \"You could see the house was a disaster by its roof,\" she said. \"It was literally sagging in the middle. Inside, you'd have thought someone had taken a&#xa0;hammer to the place.\"</p> <p>The signs were bad for Priory Hall right from the start. The development was part of the much-vaunted new Northern Fringe. \"The idea was to develop an extension to the city of Dublin with high-density housing and good public services and transport,\" says local TD <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Broughan\" title=\"\">Tommy Broughan</a>. Many of the top developers obtained sites. McFeely's was at the southern end of what was to have been the main boulevard through the new towns of Clongriffin and Belmayne. \"They call it the boulevard of broken dreams now,\" Broughan says.</p> <p>In 2004, a woman had just dropped her children at school and was driving home along the edge of McFeely's building site when her car was crushed by steel mesh grids weighing over a tonne. She was described as having narrowly escaped death. Two years later, another woman had a narrow escape when her car was hit by a section of scaffolding falling from the same site. A health and safety inspector said this was \"one of the most unsafe\" sites he had ever inspected. The high court ordered the site to be temporarily closed because of \"systemic\" breaches of regulations.</p> <p>In the years that followed, there were complaints about estates left in an \"appalling state\", roads unfinished, \"wires sticking out of the showers\", fire hazards. After Dublin city council brought McFeely to court over problems in an estate in west Dublin, the president of the high court said there had been \"clear unwillingness\" and \"foot dragging\" by the developer.</p> <p>Clongriffin today is a sorry sight. There's a&#xa0;forlorn railway station, but most of the promised facilities were never developed. Some estates are half-empty, while others have been half-built, then abandoned. Roads end in hoardings. One&#xa0;has \"Drug dealers out\" scrawled on it.</p> <p>One public housing tenant at Priory Hall was taken to hospital because of the damp soon after it opened. Just before Christmas in 2009, the council moved its tenants out after fire inspectors deemed the buildings dangerous. Broughan demanded a debate in the Irish parliament about the \"outrageous situation\", pointing out that \"key planning and building regulations\" had obviously been ignored. McFeely undertook to do works.</p> <p>One owner agrees to take me round and talk about what happened on condition that I do not use his name. McFeely's reputation as a \"rough merchant\" has not diminished. (In May, a London high court judge found there was a \"strong suggestion\" that, based on a sham lease he had helped to devise, McFeely had received almost \u20ac4m in rents for a building near the Olympic Village in Stratford, and that he and others had intimidated the directors of the leasing company.)</p> <p>\"My wife and I bought off plans in 2005,\" the apartment owner says. \"It was our first home together. The apartments were expensive but this was the peak of the boom and the banks were throwing money at people. We brought in a&#xa0;surveyor but he was refused access.\"</p> <p>The security man on the locked-up site lets us in and we climb stained, carpeted stairs to the apartment. The living room window looks out over the abrupt end of the road and a mound of grassed-over rubble at the edge of waste ground where the boulevard was meant to be. \"We kind of knew from the start the place was blighted,\" the man says. \"The car park was always flooded. The place was damp. One morning we were woken by a&#xa0;knock on the door and it was the young couple downstairs. Their ceiling had fallen in. Sewage pipes went nowhere \u2013 just ended. We were paying a management fee but nothing was getting done.\"</p> <p>Then, one morning in October 2011, the man was driving to work when he heard on the news that the city council had gone to court to get an order for the apartments to be evacuated. Insurance companies ceased cover. Fire crews stood by as residents packed cars and vans, and moved to hotels, spare rooms and rented apartments. The high court ordered the council to pay for their accommodation \u2013 it has since appealed against this.</p> <p>\"Self-regulation is outrageous,\" the man says. \"It turns out McFeely declared the complex to be 'in substantial compliance' with all the rules and regulations, and the council just accepted that. It was crazy \u2013 we first set eyes on McFeely in court. He called us begrudgers and 'jumped-up little Hitlers'.\" One resident shouted back at the builder that he \"couldn't build a snowman\".</p> <p>At first, it was agreed that setting things right would take five weeks. Then a dispute blew up between McFeely and Dublin city council, which led to McFeely being arrested and briefly jailed, before he appealed to the supreme court, which found in his favour. When the council made public its enforcement order, the owners knew the place was doomed. \"There were 18 pages of items, most of them very serious. Basically, nothing was right.\"</p> <p>\"They crucified me,\" McFeely says of the massive tax settlement he had to make with the Criminal Assets Bureau. Having paid, he went straight out and bought a Bentley for nearly \u20ac50,000. \"I stuck my two fingers up at them. They thought they could destroy me. I'm getting hammered because I had the audacity to come down here and live on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailesbury_Road\" title=\"\">Ailesbury Road</a>. It's the Free State mentality \u2013 I'm&#xa0;a Nordie with a republican reputation.\"</p> <p>It is certainly true that the wealthy of Dublin&#xa0;tend to be snobbish and that the huge made-in-the-H-blocks Celtic cross in McFeely's drawing room window looks incongruous. He is far from being the only local resident to be familiar with the inside of a courtroom, but is one of the few who has been in jail. His fleet of vehicles is normal for the area \u2013 though the Bentley has gone.&#xa0;\"I&#xa0;paid a lawyer with it.\" In fact, the McFeelys have been ordered to leave the house after his second wife failed to persuade the high court to let her remain there in her own right.</p> <p>McFeely says his building practices and standards are normal, and that he has co-operated with attending to any \"snags\" as required, though he disputes others' assessments of these.</p> <p>There is mounting evidence that he is right about standards \u2013 one large apartment block built by another developer has recently been evacuated as unsafe and it is likely that more will follow. \"A lot of the other developers are bad-mouthing me because they think I'm bringing the heat on them,\" McFeely says. \"But I'm no tout.\"</p> <p>He makes no apology for his British passport. \"I&#xa0;am still a republican, but I was born a British subject and I'm smarter than the rest of them. I&#xa0;fought for a socialist republic and I still believe in that. Blame the peace processers for copper-fastening the border. And by the way, you get better justice in the British courts.\"</p> <p>There is still a framed poster on the staircase of Sinn F\u00e9in's offices in Dungiven, near McFeely's old home, showing him among the 1980 hunger strikers. The museum upstairs is full of Troubles memorabilia, including a glass case containing a&#xa0;couple of AK47s and a 1977 poster demanding \"Break the connection with England \u2013 the source of all our evils\". But all has changed. Downstairs, at the front desk, there's the order of business for the Assembly at Stormont, where Martin McGuinness is now deputy first minister. The day I visit, the front pages have photos of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/queen-martin-mcguinness-shake-hands\" title=\"\">McGuinness and the Queen shaking hands</a>.</p> <p>McFeely's old IRA comrades are loyal. They speak of the \"rare bond\" that exists between ex-prisoners. They say they don't know much about what he is accused of in the Republic. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13593097\" title=\"\">Sean McGlinchey</a>, now Sinn F\u00e9in mayor of Limavady, says McFeely, still a good friend despite their political differences, \"never got over\" the end of the hunger strike. \"He is no angel, but we all have our faults, we all make mistakes.\" He admits McFeely was always aggressive. \"He wouldn't go around a thing \u2013 he'd go through it. He's a bull.\"</p> <p>Down the road in Derry, Eamonn McCann, who inspired McFeely all those years ago, is still a&#xa0;campaigning socialist. \"McFeely represents something almost stereotypical,\" he says. \"A&#xa0;republican who is a property developer and a&#xa0;landlord. There is a great deal of resentment against the political establishment in the Republic. Men like McFeely feel they have done intense things 'for Ireland' and they are entitled to some return. Of course, you have Fianna F\u00e1il ministers who have also acted as if the state is something to be treated with contempt.\"</p> <p>Theresa McGuinness has no interest in any of this. She has spent the past decade fighting through the courts, representing herself, to get McFeely to pay her back the money he owes her for the house she never got. She has been more assiduous than any state agency in her pursuit of him. \"This man has put me through a pure nightmare,\" she says. \"Why should I let him get away with it?\"</p> <p>McFeely is much debated on political websites. One contributor recently said of him, it's like \"all&#xa0;that's been wrong with this land for the last 40 years\" in one man.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>I'm a very unhappy teacher who needs to find a way out </strong><br></h2> <p><strong>I am a part-time teacher, having reduced my hours several times. I have little enthusiasm for the job and an Ofsted inspection two years ago graded a lesson of mine \"inadequate\", which knocked my confidence for six. A more recent lesson was \"satisfactory\", but this is no longer good enough in today's world, and I would be unlikely to get another job when every school is asking for \"outstanding\" teachers.</strong></p> <p><strong>During a gap in teaching I worked in libraries and as a teaching assistant, which I found much less stressful, but felt pressure to return to teaching once my daughter was older. Money is not a problem as my husband has a good job. My efforts over the past year to find myself another job have been unsuccessful, and I'm caught in the trap of having to give at least half a term's notice, which precludes many positions outside teaching that advertise at the last minute. On top of all this, my drive to work is nearly an hour each way, and I would like to find a job closer to home. Please help me out of this muddle.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>When you say you're not sure that teaching is right for you any more, you're surely guilty of understatement. You have little enthusiasm for the job, you find it stressful \u2013 and you're concerned that your standards may no longer be at a level the children in your classes deserve. The sooner you make the decision to leave teaching for good, the better for everyone. There's no shame attached; but there might be if you let the situation drag on.</p> <p>You're fortunate that money is not a problem. You like to keep busy and contribute to household expenses and I'm sure you will again. For now, however, you should hand in your necessary notice right away. The very act of doing so will have an immediate and beneficial effect on your state of mind.</p> <p>Next, ask yourself what sort of occupation you'd enjoy. The best you can say of the work you did during that eight years' gap was that you found it \"less stressful\". You now have the enviable opportunity to look for work that you'd find rewarding in itself.</p> <p>I don't know your interests or personal strengths \u2013 but you do. Put potential job satisfaction before any consideration; that, in turn, should make you of particular interest to certain employers. You'll almost certainly find it takes some time to work out what you want to do then track it down. So be patient and involve your husband closely in what you're doing; you'll need his support and understanding.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Ofsted found your <em>lessons</em> to be inadequate and unsatisfactory, not you personally. I'm not a teacher, but I can see how it must feel very personal. It's not a sensitive system. I don't think you need to leave teaching. Staying, and trying to work constructively on the identified weaknesses, means you could regain your mojo and turn things round. <strong>katie888</strong></p> <p>\u2022 I think you could ask for extra support to develop your teaching skills, move to a different school environment or seek a less demanding post, having first negotiated with your head teacher that you can give less notice. If you are frank about how you are feeling, I'm sure they will agree. Teaching is a profession that can burn people out, but you will retain many significant skills you can easily transfer to a new role. I feel very positive about what lies ahead. <strong>ExBrightonBelle</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Why not try tutoring? Of course, the hours do need to be outside of school hours which means late afternoons, evenings and perhaps weekends, but the big advantage is that you can teach in the way that makes sense to you, in your professional judgement, which seems not to be allowed in schools these days. <strong>KatieJane99</strong></p> <h2><strong>Can I tell my boss I'm struggling to manage on my \u00a318k salary?</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>I've worked for a small PR agency in London for a year and struggle on my salary of \u00a318,000. My employer has said she will only reassess my salary once a year, even though my responsibilities and workload have considerably increased in the last six months.</strong></p> <p><strong>I feel this is really unfair as I am doing a job I'm not being paid for. I was hired as an assistant, but am now essentially an account manager. I am drowning in debts and worry constantly about the future. I appreciate I am at the bottom of the ladder and that in five years' time I will be earning a lot more, but I can't afford to live on \u00a318,000 for much longer. Do I carry on until I can work elsewhere or keep on fighting? Is it OK to tell your employer you are struggling to make ends meet?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>It sounds as if this is your first proper job. Because you've only been doing it for a year, you'll still be feeling a little uncertain about your worth and bargaining power. From what you tell me, it seems pretty clear that your boss is only too happy to take advantage of such insecurity.</p> <p>Your sense of unfairness is understandable \u2013 but you must be very careful not to let it fester until you do or say something you might later regret. You ask if it's OK to tell an employer you're struggling to make ends meet. Of course it is, but that's not the right way to approach the matter; it's a bit feeble. You need to raise the subject of your salary in a way that offers further evidence of your maturity and competence. Neither plead nor threaten. Your boss will be perfectly aware of your value and won't want to risk losing you. That's understood \u2013 you won't do yourself any favours by underlining it.</p> <p>You need to restate your case for an increase, this time in writing. Tell her, as you've told me, that you like the agency and much enjoy the job. Be specific about the amount you're applying for. You can certainly make the point that the travel and living requirements that go with the job have significant financial implications.</p> <p>Above all, remember your case will be successful at least as much because of the manner in which you present it as on its intrinsic merit; your employer needs to see you as a serious, confident person and one with potential.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 18k for a de facto account manager in a PR firm in London is ridiculous. I would push your boss one last time, pointing out the disparity of your salary vs the market rate. Start looking for a new job immediately if they refuse to do anything about it. <strong>Fwoggie</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The fact you've been given more responsibility is a good sign, and should lead to a pay rise when you're next up for review. If you don't get a rise, then make it clear you're unhappy and will be considering your options. <strong>tarnarama</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It seems to me that the debt is a complicating factor, rather than the source of the problem. So I wouldn't make any reference to it \u2013 employers' view of a wage is at a productivity based level, rather than one based on social need. <strong>JackAdam</strong></p> <p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto: dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><strong>Rainy Brain, Sunny Brain</strong> by Elaine Fox (Heinemann, \u00a312.99)<br>Do you find your brain functions less well during a miserable wet summer? Me too, but the weather in this book's title is more metaphorical. The psychologist author collates research and anecdotes about the personality traits of optimism (sunny) and pessimism (rainy). Pessimism, she argues, comes from an overactive amygdala, the \"fear&#xa0;brain\"; optimism might be self-deluding, but it's evolutionarily \"highly adaptive\", and tends to make good things happen. As Franklin D Roosevelt didn't quite put it: \"The ultimate obstacle to an optimistic life is&#xa0;fear itself, our emergency brain.\"</p> <p>Fox constructs an elegant narrative from neuroimaging results, her clever psychology experiments, and the interaction of genetics and environment. One can even learn, she promises, to be less pessimistic, with a dash of CBT, \"cognitive bias modification\", or meditation: so this falls into the well-populated genre of scientifically approved Stoicism. Heartwarmingly, it even seems that optimism can bring riches: Fox tells an anecdote of two Irish brothers, one of whom (the optimist) is now \"a multimillionaire\", and the other (less \"sunny\") \"a schoolteacher in Dublin, struggling to pay his mortgage\". What an idiot. But if everyone becomes an entrepreneur, who will educate the kids?</p> <p><strong>Why the Olympics Aren't Good for Us, and How They Can Be</strong> by Mark Perryman (OR Books, \u00a38)<br>This educator, a research fellow in sport and leisure culture, also enjoys the inestimable advantage of clairvoyance. In a book published before the London Olympics, he announces that his \"scepticism\" about whether they would be any good for the country \"turned out to be well-founded\". Since I cannot claim similar powers of prediction, I will not argue. (Except to say: David Beckham on a speedboat. Come on! How is that not good for the country?)</p> <p>Perryman reminds us that the torch procession was invented by the Nazis (sigh), but also mounts a detailed and persuasive case against the commercialisation of global megasport. The second half details his own, nicely quirky proposals for making a better Olympic Games. There should be more events that are free to watch and more that are cheap to train in, he argues persuasively. Why not make darts an Olympic sport? Good idea, and let's not stop there: I also nominate skipping, stickfighting and thumb war.</p> <p><strong>God: All That Matters</strong> by Mark Vernon (Hodder, \u00a37.99)<br>This entry in a confidently subtitled new series of short introductions is a light-footed scoot through theologies both ancient and (post)modern. Vernon, a philosopher and former priest, likes to demonstrate Greek sources of Christian ideas (Plotinus and Plato figure heavily), and to confound the Dawkinsites with ideas of God that do not conflict with science.</p> <p>Combining a gentle scepticism with sympathy for theological yearnings, the author touches on those modern-science-approved Stoics, Spinoza, William James, Don Cupitt, \"process theology\", game theory, the techno-eschatology of the \"singularity\", and \"apophatic theology\", which says you can't talk about God at all \u2013 in our day, Vernon comments wryly, \"such theology has, arguably, become unfashionable and even a source of annoyance\". Particularly interesting is his chapter on the resurgence of Taoism in China, and its potential as an \"ecotheology\". This is a pleasingly ecumenical exercise, with an appendix on \"10 films to see\" that recommends <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy and <em>The Exorcist</em>: good, perhaps, for giving your amygdala an Olympic workout and hoping it falls asleep from exhaustion.</p>",
  "<p>As if the first world war was not trial enough, those who survived were then exposed to two devastating global infections: an outbreak of Spanish flu and a mysterious \"brain fever\" or \"sleeping sickness\", subsequently medicalised as <em>Encephalitis lethargica</em>. The victims divided fairly neatly between three outcomes: death, recovery or catatonia, the latter patients surviving in either frozen silence or with frenzied, repetitive tics. However, having been hospitalised in this condition for five decades, some recovered after the experimental administration of L-Dopa, a drug developed to treat Parkinson's disease.</p> <p>This real-life fairytale of suspension and reanimation has already inspired two remarkable literary works: <em>Awakenings</em> (1978), a non-fiction account by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/05/booksonhealth.whauden\" title=\"\">Dr Oliver Sacks</a>, and one of Harold Pinter's finest plays, <em>A Kind of Alaska</em> (1982), in which a young woman stricken with the disease wakes to find herself an old woman in an unrecognisable country. Will Self, in his 15th work of fiction, creates a third brilliant and original work from the story of these \"enkies\".</p> <p>As has become fairly standard in modern fiction, several narratives and time periods are simultaneously in play: London and the French trenches in 1918, Friern Barnet Mental Hospital in 1971, and North London again on the eve of the 2010 election. But whereas most fictional time-jumpers confine the separate strands within sections or chapters, Self switches focus between sentences or, sometimes, during them: in a printed equivalent of the dissolve device in films, one character thinking of another will somehow lift the reader into the latter's consciousness. With no textual divisions, speech represented without quotation marks and scarcely any line indentations, the book is, in effect, a single paragraph of 397 pages and around 120,000 words. In common with another book on the 2012 Man Booker longlist \u2013 Nicola Barker's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/18/the-yips-nicola-barker-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Yips</em></a>, which also challenges the normal shape of a story on the page \u2013 <em>Umbrella</em> must have led to all leave being cancelled at the typesetters and printers.</p> <p>The structure, though, is clearly encouraged by the subject-matter: <em>Encephalitis lethargica</em> represents a paradox of consciousness, in which the patient, though in medico-legal terms still here, is predominantly somewhere else. Audrey, the patient on whom the book mainly focuses, spends her half-century absence making repetitive hand motions which (the reader understands before her doctors) relate to her earlier life. While attempting to solve her mystery, psychiatrist Dr Zack Busner is distracted by a far more common problem of human consciousness, which is that memories and brain-lodged song lyrics, printed in italics, keep thwarting his thoughts.</p> <p>These plot-lines make stream-of-consciousness the logical form for a novel which also plays a sharp literary joke on Audrey: having gone under in 1918, she missed out on modernism \u2013 four years into her trance came the influential splinterings of language and form in Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> and TS Eliot's <em>The Waste Land</em>. Her story is being told in a fashion that is, like most of her startling 1970s surroundings, foreign to her.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/25/booker-prize-2012-longlist\" title=\"\">Man Booker longlist</a> on which <em>Umbrella</em> stands (and from which it deserves to proceed) is widely seen as a deliberate correction to the controversial plea from last year's judges for \"readability\", and some may conclude that Self's book represents the opposite quality. But, though hard work is certainly demanded from the reader, it is always rewarded. Through the polyphonic, epoch-hopping torrent, we gradually construct a coherent and beguiling narrative. As the title-defining epigraph from Joyce alerts us \u2013 \"A brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella\" \u2013 fraternity is an urgent concern. Busner carries the shadow of a brother and Audrey of two, although the ominous surname the siblings share \u2013 Death \u2013 has been variously scrambled by vanity and mistranscription. In a linear reassembly of events, Busner, in 2010, is remembering how, in 1971, he brought the sleeping beauty Audrey back to life, using the pharmaceutical prince-kiss of L-Dopa. Audrey had been a feminist and munitions worker whose brothers served the war effort respectively at the Somme and in Whitehall, and whose postwar fates were starkly different.</p> <p>From this dense tapestry, dramatic set-piece scenes rise in high relief: Audrey's sexual awakening, her medical reawakening, Busner's tense visit to a retired colleague. Self links different eras and people through linguistic echoes, so that a sex scene adopts the metaphor of weapons construction, and medical advances take on the phrases of the battlefield.</p> <p>The tightest binding, though, is the title word, which becomes, as they say, an umbrella term: referring to an anti-shell device in the trenches, a retracted foreskin revealing a prepuce, an intra-muscular syringe. The restored Audrey, shocked by newspaper photos of the moon landings, notes that even the lunar buggy seems to have an umbrella trailing behind.</p> <p>In common with his early mentor, Martin Amis, Self has sometimes risked his violently distinctive guiding voice overpowering plot and characters. <em>Umbrella</em> does contain a few of the thesaurus-gorged sentences that inflame his detractors, but the author is generally invisible within the intricate Babel of voices (although Busner is given some brainy Self-ish riffs on subjects including Judaism, nazism, ageing and umbrellas).</p> <p>More than once, the doctor refers to the experience of his \"enks\" as \"astonishing\", which it is, although Self's treatment of them is more pessimistic than that of Pinter or Sacks. Busner concludes that there is no such thing as a medical miracle, and that he cannot long delay the fate printed on Audrey's birth certificate under \"name\". The tale of the awakened patients is, though, miraculously captivating and, in <em>Umbrella</em>, receives another magnificent reimagining.</p> <p>Mark Lawson's<em> Enough Is Enough</em> is published by Picador.

  "<p>In past years, the visual arts have always appeared to take a back seat during the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international festival</a>. Perhaps it seemed impossible to compete with the cacophony of the main festival, the fringe and the <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/\" title=\"\">book festival</a>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jul/30/edinburgh-art-festival-director-sorcha-carey\" title=\"\">Sorcha Carey, director of the art festival</a>, has decided to redress the balance with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-19081286\" title=\"\">Festival Promenade</a>, a series of works intended to bring the visual arts out of the galleries and into the places where people will be gathering for events. This \"magical playground\" will feature commissions allowing the artist \"to create works that interrogate their spaces\". To quote one participating artist, \"art is the thing that allows us to ask interesting questions about your life\".</p> <p>The festival's first permanent \"legacy\" installation was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YiYCMwJtj4\"><em>Martin Creed's Work No 1059</em></a>, commissioned for it by the Fruitmarket Gallery. <br>The work, 104 outdoor steps clad in differently coloured marbles, accompanied Creed's retrospective show at the gallery. This year, with a commissioning budget of \u00a3250,000, Carey has turned away from permanent installations and chosen instead to commission a daring set of new interactive works, declaring that the choice is \"unabashedly about showcasing Scottish artists\". While the ambitious list includes some well-known artists, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2010/dec/06/turner-prize-winner-susan-philipsz\" title=\"\">Susan Philipsz, the 2010 Turner prize winner</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.frithstreetgallery.com/artists/bio/callum_innes/?/innes.html\" title=\"\">Callum Innes</a>, a 1995 Turner prize nominee, it also embraces recent graduates of Scotland's art schools.</p> <p>Carey says her chief aim is \"to establish the delicate but important balance between the permanent and temporary in this massive World Heritage Site\". I first met her during the opening week of<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/arts/design/documenta-13-in-kassel-germany.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\"> dOCUMENTA (13) in Kassel,</a> where she introduced me to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRABZ3nqDkE\" title=\"\">Philipsz, whose <em>Study for Strings</em></a>, a sound piece responding to the history of the Hauptbahnhof, was one of the most affecting works for many visitors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663418\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344527381320/Timeline-by-Susan-Philips-001.jpg\" alt=\"Timeline by Susan Philipsz\" width=\"460\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Timeline</em>, by Susan Philipsz</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Philipsz confessed that when she made her first site visit to Edinburgh she did not really know the city. As a child growing up in a large Catholic family in Glasgow, she spent little time in Edinburgh, later studying in Belfast and New York and eventually settling in Berlin. She says her inspiration for <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/commissions/susan_philipsz2C_timeline/\" title=\"\"><em>Timeline</em></a>, her Edinburgh work, was the spectacular view spread out below Nelson's Monument, and the tradition of the daily one o'clock gun in Edinburgh Castle, which was originally connected by a mile-long cable to the ball-drop on Cable Hill for sailors at sea to set their chronometers.</p> <p>Philipsz's work will replace the long-removed cable, her sung tripartite chord being taken down the hill through seven individual speakers in a kind of domino effect. The work is a homage to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Robison_(physicist)\" title=\"\">Edinburgh resident John Robinson</a>, who invented the siren, and to the sirens from Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> who lured sailors on to the rocks with the devastating beauty of their sound. Philipsz plays me the chord, simple and pure, which sounds to her, she says, \"somewhat like a train\". Its magic in Edinburgh will be its fleetingness, under a minute in all, and the mystery of where the sound is coming from.</p> <p>Philipsz's sound trajectory will finish near the gun itself, in the gardens beneath the castle, where Edinburgh College of Art graduate <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/events/2012-08-02/\" title=\"\">Emily Speed will stage a one-off performance of <em>Human Castle</em></a>. The work will be composed of 10 \"acro-balancers\" in cardboard costumes, counterbalancing to form a castle-like shape before dismounting. Carey observes that Speed \"draws out fragility in something that we often think of as solid and immovable by making them animate\".</p> <p>This is Speed's first performance back in Edinburgh, having left the city in 2002 to live and work in Japan before settling in Liverpool, and will be the first time she has not taken part. Instead she will assume the role of director: \"It's quite strange to lose control of the work,\" she says. \"It's terrifying but exciting working with the acrobats and I know that people will ask if it is acrobatics or a piece of art.\"</p> <p>She describes the commission as \"an act of faith\", saying Carey \"is not scared to take risks.\" When I speak to Speed she is in the midst of making the costumes. \"I won't know if it works until they do it,\" she says. \"I am asking the acrobats to do something they have never done before: counterbalance.\" There will be only one performance lasting a few minutes, but it will be filmed and screened throughout the festival.</p> <p>In her determination to integrate the programme into the city, Carey identified Rose Street, a short road dominated at one junction by a brutish modernist BHS, as an ideal location for works. <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/commissions/rose_street_film_programme/\" title=\"\">The Rose Street film programme</a> will include Speed's film and will show on small screens in shop windows along the street in daylight, while at night films will be screened on BHS's large external wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663419\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344512258733/Kevin-Harman-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Harman\" width=\"460\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The artist Kevin Harman Photograph: Stuart Armitt/Edinburgh Art Festival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Armitt/Edinburgh Art Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rose Street will also be the location for <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/commissions/kevin_harman/\" title=\"\">Kevin Harman's work <em>24/7</em></a>. Carey first saw the work of Edinburgh native Harman in his degree show. She says his work is \"engaging people about the world and the art, 24/7,\" and her ambitions for the festival as a whole seem to be summed up in the way she describes his piece as a \"facilitation of dialogue\".</p> <p>Harman stole 210 of his neighbours' doormats from three enormous tenement buildings, leaving notes that they could be reclaimed at his degree show, where they were arranged as a giant work of art. The work sought to bring the community together in an unexpected way. Harman says he \"comes to an environment open to the ideas of the viewer\". He chooses not to talk about details of his festival project, saying: \"If I think too much about the project it becomes too contrived.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663420\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344512443705/Anthony-Schrag-001.jpg\" alt=\"Anthony Schrag\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Schrag's <em>Wall Standing</em>.

It too will take place on Rose Street and is part of Carey's aim to \"encourage people to broaden their idea of what art can be\". Although Schrag is currently based in the city, he is billed as the Edinburgh \"Tourist in Residence\", reflecting his interest in the changing landscape of his beloved city. He will take small groups around Edinburgh on unusual outings ranging from an early morning walk to a blindfold tour and a communal nap in a park, as well as the Rose Street pub crawl. Although the majority of Schrag's work has been produced outside the gallery context, he does not see himself as a performance artist. He observes that \"unlike in performance art, the viewer takes equal part in the creation of the work\". Rather than the city's beauty spots, his tours will explore the dark alleyways, turning away from the idea that \"art looks at beautiful things\".</p> <p>Of all the artists participating in Festival Promenade, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2aunPHTe_I\" title=\"\">Callum Innes</a>, an Edinburgh resident who shows with a local gallery, could be called the most traditional, with his paintings unashamedly exploring pure abstraction. But for the first time, he works here in light: in his installation<a href=\"http://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/event/253890-callum-innes-the-regent-bridge/\" title=\"\"> <em>The Regent Bridge</em></a>, two \"paintings\" made of light will change colour with random variations. He says he wanted to \"bring attention and to re-emphasise\" the structure and beauty of the Regent Bridge. \"This is such a dark part of Edinburgh, behind the station, that the changes have to be quick. It's a work of art, not a Georgian project,\" he says firmly. Like many others, Innes felt that the \"festival has always deserved a good visual arts festival\", so he donated his fee and says nervously, as he has not seen the finished work yet, \"it challenged me and works for the city\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394663421\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344523799650/Song-Bird-by-John-Bellany-001.jpg\" alt=\"Song Bird by John Bellany\" width=\"460\" height=\"403\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Song Bird</em> by John Bellany, 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Glasgow-based artist <a href=\"http://www.inglebygallery.com/news/andrew-miller-edinburgh-art-festival-pavilion/\" title=\"\">Andrew Miller provides the seeming centre of the installations with <em>The Waiting Place</em></a>, a temporary structure that will provide shelter from the elements, a starting point for Schrag's tours, and information including artist<a href=\"http://www.peterarkle.com/\" title=\"\"> Peter Arkle</a>'s fantastical yet useful map of the festival. Miller has been exploring the interplay between design and art for years. I tell him that his piece seems the most imposing, in a sense, and he laughs. \"It's hard to find \u2013 you have to go off the path and go into the trees, and after the festival it will disappear unless someone comes and decides to buy it and they have both space and a tree to put it round.\" I point out how different this seems from the more grandiose <a href=\"http://www.serpentinegallery.org/architecture/\" title=\"\"><em>Serpentine Pavilions</em></a>. Miller admits that he had a \"quite generous budget, but the structure, while it is temporary, is robust. This is a cross between an <a href=\"http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Aalto_Summer_House.html\" title=\"\">Alvar Aalto summerhouse</a> and a Trinidadian shack.\" <em>The Waiting Place</em> appears to be more of a whimsical summerhouse, and is appropriately named after a line from Dr Seuss: it offers a space \"in which you're welcome to simply enjoy the act of waiting for something to happen\". Miller says \"it will keep you dry, but it is well ventilated deliberately, as it is about looking out. People animate it.\"</p> <p>In Edinburgh, Carey is channelling artists' energy to act outside the cossetted space of the white cube.

There was no anguish about the state of a nation whose golden generation has again failed to deliver, no air of threat in rougher pubs, and instead an instantaneous, pragmatic switching of attention to other sports. And, boy, didn't it pay off? Rowing, boxing, running, jumping \u2013 it turns out Brits can be world-beaters in anything when they stop obsessing with football. It's not purely an Olympic phenomenon, either \u2013 we're still just about top table in cricket, which might once have been called a national game, but doomed English efforts in soccer today bar any rival claim to that title. Why, when we start ignoring the spoilt boys of the beautiful game, we can even produce a winner at Wimbledon. For the sake of Britain's mental health, the Olympics has shown it is time to change the national sport \u2013 but what to? With seven <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19172975\" title=\"\">gold medals in track cycling and one in road racing</a>, the two-wheeled answer is plain. After Bradley Wiggins's Tour de France win, it would also scratch the ugly itch to infuriate our friends across the Channel, who regard cycling as their own.</p>",
  "<p>It requires an Olympian suspension of disbelief to take at face value David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/10/olympics-mo-farah-gold-hunger-summit\" title=\"\">Downing Street hunger summit</a> just hours before the Games' closing ceremony. When tackling malnutrition involves photo-opportunities with icons such as Mo Farah and David Beckham, it's hard not to be sceptical. But Mr Cameron, determined to hang on to the 0.7% of GDP aid target, has an incomparably better record on development than any recent Tory predecessor.</p> <p>There is no question that there are more hungry people than ever before, nor that chronic malnutrition is devastating. It is a contributory factor to infant mortality, stunted growth, and intellectual underdevelopment, part of the cruel cycle of deprivation. It reflects an intransigent mix of economic, social and cultural factors \u2013 family size and access to contraception, climate change, poor farming techniques, bad food as well as not enough of it, and limited access to productive land; and \u2013 as the return of hunger after the apparent triumph of the 1970s green revolution shows \u2013 it is also to do with the limitations and unintended consequences of science. Underlying it all is an unfair distribution system that pays dividends for speculators \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cargill.com/company/financial/index.jsp\" title=\"\">the grain trader Cargill </a>announced revenues of $134bn this week \u2013 while the system remains unable to deliver food to those who need it.</p> <p>Mr Cameron, and his co-host, the Brazilian vice-president Michel Temer, say they want the world to focus <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/10/olympics-mo-farah-gold-hunger-summit\" title=\"\">on malnutrition</a>, not create more targets like the unmet millennium development goals to halve the number of hungry children. The development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, talks of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9743000/9743999.stm\" title=\"\">\"galvanising people\"</a>. But while hunger is a cause of many of the south's problems, it also a symptom. Engaging industry and governments, as Mr Mitchell proposes, is misplaced when organisations from <a href=\"http://waronwant.org/attachments/Food%20sovereignty%20report.pdf\" title=\"\">War on Want</a> to Kofi Annan's <a href=\"http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/\" title=\"\">Africa Progress Panel</a> talk of the need to put smallholders centre stage, to focus on inequality and to end the escalating <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/10/action-now-prevent-worsening-cycle-hunger?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">land grabs</a> that reduce the rural poor to labourers. In Africa alone, an area larger than Germany and France together has been sold for agribusiness while untold thousands of farmers have been evicted with scant compensation.</p> <p>The real goal is not, or not only, the food security that Mr Mitchell talks about, but sustainability. That is about small-scale, cooperative development that does not violate the land or require oil-based fertilisers. It needs thriving local markets, water management, the preservation of diversity, and support for country-based agricultural research. Brazil knows this <a href=\"http://www.acdivoca.org/site/ID/brazilCDP/\" title=\"\">first hand</a>. It is not quite how Mr Cameron is selling it, but passing the challenge to a country that is making real progress on hunger and rural poverty might be just what's needed.</p>",
  "<p>With A-level results out in England and Wales this week, thoughts will turn to the future, amid gloomy news of large student debts and graduate unemployment. A year after their own A-level results, Zak Antrobus, 19, who has just completed his first year at university, and Jasmine Cope, 17, who joined a school-leavers' training scheme, discuss whether going to university is worth it. Emine Saner listens in.</p> <p><strong>Jasmine Cope:</strong> I didn't apply for university. I went into a training scheme with PriceWaterhouseCoopers. I've worked for a year with full pay and lots of training. It's just as good an experience as university. I've met lots of new people and got to work in a new environment.</p> <p><strong>Zak Antrobus:</strong> I chose to go to university. All my friends planned to go so I thought I should try to get in, and it would open up more opportunities for me. I'm in my first year of economics and finance. In the long term, I thought there would be more jobs available if I have a degree. I prefer the idea of learning for a little longer, going on a placement for a year, finishing my degree and possibly getting a job at the placement.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I work in tax, and they are putting me through the ATT, the Association of Tax Technicians qualification. From my point of view, a degree would be unnecessary because you would need that professional qualification anyway. I thought it was good to go straight in and get experience, on full pay. I'm not getting into debt and they are covering my training fees. There was so much pressure to go to university at my school. A few years ago, university wasn't always expected for everyone, but now it is.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>I wasn't that bothered about the debt. I managed to get in on the lower fees before they increased, so there was more of an incentive to go that year, but going to university is an investment that will go towards paying off those debts.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> What about people who don't get a&#xa0;job at the end of it?</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>Eventually they will. I won't have to pay back my finance until I earn over a&#xa0;certain amount. It probably should worry me, but it doesn't.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I thought, because unemployment is so high and particularly for under 25s, I should start looking for a job now rather than hope the economy will have picked up in four years. I thought it was best to go in and get experience because you can have qualifications, but if you don't have experience, it doesn't look good.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>That is something I worry about. I&#xa0;have quite a few qualifications, but not&#xa0;really any experience. I feel that is something that will hold me back later.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> That's hard for everyone \u2013 people are taking on interns and not paying them. I&#xa0;thought I might as well be working full time, rather than trying to get internships during summer breaks.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>I hope things will be better by the time I graduate. If they're not, I'm not sure what I'll do. Among the people I&#xa0;know, it doesn't really bother them. They don't say \"we're at university now but when we leave we won't be able to find a job\". It's more about living now and knowing you have to get good grades. I know I need to get at least a&#xa0;2:1&#xa0;to get a good placement.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> Of the people I know who went to university, some have picked a degree that will get them a career, like medicine or vet science, or they're just going for the experience, and it doesn't matter that they'll come out with debt. That's great for them, but I thought it was a luxury. I think some people seem to be pretending unemployment isn't happening, or it's in the future and they're not going to think about it. University is meant to be fun, and people say you make loads of friends, but I have fun and meet people who aren't my own age. People seem to think if you're in a full-time job, you're chained to a desk and not allowed to talk to anyone.</p> <p><strong>Emine Saner:</strong> Is there a hierarchy between graduates and non-graduates at your job?</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> Not at all. Maybe when graduates first come in they realise they're at the same level as us. I wouldn't say it's a snobbery, more a realisation. You don't need to have a degree to be a manager or a partner, there are no barriers, but I see there can be in other jobs.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>Having a degree might not be needed but I think it can look better. After my A-levels I wasn't sure what I&#xa0;wanted to do for a job. This has given me another few years to think about it. I&#xa0;chose to go to uni for the degree, but I&#xa0;have enjoyed meeting new people and making friends. It's a great experience. I&#xa0;have been living with 11 others and there is no one else in my flat doing my course \u2013 we've got people doing English, engineering, law. It's really good for me, it's boosted my confidence.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> My friends are from small towns and they've met people at uni from different backgrounds. I can see how that is good.</p> <p><strong>ES: </strong>Have you felt left out by not going?</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I might call them and say I'm knackered from work and they'll say, \"Can I talk to you later? I'm just about to go out for the fourth time this week.\" There is that aspect that none of them have done what I've done. But I've also moved out of home, I'm living with new people. I&#xa0;don't think that's necessarily the university experience, it's just growing up. University forces you to go away from home and learn things like how to cook and meet new people, but if you're motivated you can do that without uni.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>If I didn't go to university I would probably still be living at home. For a lot of people, going to uni helps them become more independent.</p> <p><strong>ES: </strong>By the time you're in your mid-20s, you will have been working for nearly 10 years. Do you think then that you might regret not going to university?</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> At some point I will take six months out and travel, or live somewhere else. Once I've been working for 10 years, and hopefully in the same company, you can ask for a career break. People think you have to have a gap year when you're 18 and cram everything in \u2013 \"this is my time to be free before I grow up\" \u2013 but you can do that at another time. There is such a focus on university. There was so much information [at my school] on how to write a good personal statement for a Ucas application, but there was nothing on how to write a really good CV or fill in a job application.</p> <p><strong>ZA: </strong>At my school they wanted you to go to university. They didn't force people, but they would talk about it a lot. I am the first person in my family to go, and they were happy about it. They weren't worried about the money. They were just happy for me to do what I wanted.</p> <p><strong>JC:</strong> I was talking to someone on my training course about something I had read about how people meet their partners at university. She said, \"Do you know what that means?\" and we were both like, \"Oh.\" People say, \"my old uni friends\" and I'll have to say \"my old work friends\". But I would choose to do&#xa0;the same again. If there were other variables \u2013 if it was free to go and I could get into a good university, I would have considered it, but I think what I have done is the best for me, and for where the economy is, right now.</p>",

  "<p>The finish line is in sight. After two weeks of exertion, of triumph and dejection, of glittering victory and head-down defeat that have been the focus not just of British attention but of the gaze of the entire world, the London Olympics of 2012 will soon be over \u2013 and the reflection will begin.</p> <p>In truth, the reflection has been under way from the very start, from an opening ceremony that did not serve up mere spectacle but asked its audience, particularly its British audience, to think. Danny Boyle's spectacular, so beautifully executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, but also because it had something to say.</p> <p>It presented 1948 as the pivot year in the history of modern Britain. That was the last time London played Olympic host, but also the year that saw the founding of the National Health Service and the arrival of the Windrush, the ship bearing the Caribbean migrants who would change the face of Britain.</p> <p>Both those themes \u2013 an ethos of public service and ethnic diversity \u2013 would be amplified in the ceremony and, more importantly, in the Games themselves. But that reminder of late 1940s Britain suggests another thought, too.</p> <p>For those immediate years of post-war austerity and exhaustion, still on rations as we watched our global empire unravel, birthed a national narrative that endured, with the odd interruption, for more than six decades. It is the story of decline, of Britain as a has-been nation, once glorious, now reduced to a tired marginality, bobbing around in the Atlantic stuck between Europe and a superpower United States. Somehow the story seeped into our bones, expressed in our best-loved sitcoms \u2013 with their tales of frustrated men, from Captain Mainwaring to David Brent, made ridiculous by delusions of grandeur \u2013 and by a brand of newspaper whose unspoken daily message is that the country is going to the dogs.</p> <p>Then along came London 2012 to change the script. Despite all the familiar fears of failure \u2013 of traffic snarl-ups, botched security arrangements and dreadful weather \u2013 we have surprised ourselves by staging a global event of infinite complexity with near-perfect success. The new venues, including an architecturally gorgeous velodrome and stadium, were built ahead of time and have worked flawlessly. The locations that were not new but old places put to new use \u2013 whether beach volleyball in Horse Guards or showjumping in Greenwich \u2013 showed the capital in a fresh and telegenic light, the London of a Richard Curtis movie. Not only have the athletes and bigwigs travelled to and fro without a hitch, so has everyone else. Spectators \u2013 once, admittedly, they had negotiated an online ticketing system apparently designed to induce collective rage \u2013 have filled late-night trains, sleepy with awe and delight at what they have seen. London did not fail or struggle. Instead the sun shone and the city hosted an Olympic Games of wonder.</p> <p>But if the backroom organisers showed that Britain could still excel, the country's athletes delivered an excess of proof. Team GB did better than at any Games since the first hosted by London in 1908 \u2013 back when the judges and umpires were all Brits and plenty of the sports were only played by us anyway. To rank third in the medals table this time, beaten only by superpowers US and China, is an achievement that simply does not square with the loser-ish self-image we have spent decades cultivating.</p> <p>The effect, of both these organisational and sporting triumphs, was a national good mood so unaccustomed in many it prompted suspicion and unease. Some wondered if all this patriotism was healthy for our collective soul. But most grew hoarse, cheering at the TV for the man or woman in the now-familiar all-blue union colours to row or pedal or run just a bit faster.</p> <p>And so perhaps historians might record this strange, heady fortnight as the moment when we finally laid to rest a national myth that had dogged us so long, concluding a narrative that began with one London Olympiad and ended in another: the age of decline, 1948-2012.</p> <p>Here too the opening ceremony set the tone, suggesting that we should love the country we have become \u2013 informal, mixed, quirky \u2013 rather than the one we used to be. That both it and the Games have enjoyed such a consensus of support is a surprise, because all of this is much more contentious than it appears. To see that, look no further than the clear losers of London 2012.</p> <p>Atop that uncelebrated podium stands reactionary Britain. Its face belongs to Aidan Burley, the Conservative MP who tweeted his fury at the \"multicultural crap\" he saw in Boyle's extravaganza, but behind him are all those who nodded at the Daily Mail's denunciation of the \"plastic Brits\" swelling Team GB's ranks. The Burleyites took a thorough beating at these Games, watching as not just Guardian-types but the nation exalted in the success of a team as diverse as any British city. On that golden Saturday night, when Greg Rutherford, Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah won and won and won, Twitter was cracking a joke that turned on how much we had changed: \"A ginger, a mixed-race woman and a one-time Somali refugee walk into a pub \u2013 and everyone buys them a drink.\"</p> <p>There will be others who need to alter their message after these Games. BBC bashers, emboldened after the jubilee pageant debacle, will surely hold their tongues for a while, after the corporation served up the kind of consistency, quality and quantity that perhaps only a publicly funded broadcaster is capable of. Andrew Lansley has had his warning, via Boyle, about the NHS: it is treasured not just as a valued service but as a core part of Britain's national identity. And Alex Salmond cannot easily claim the union has lost its emotional pull, not after he's seen the ease with which so many Britons, including Scots, draped themselves in its once terminally unfashionable colours.</p> <p>Of course it cannot last, not at this pitch at any rate. Already, like the holidaymakers who know they are due to fly home in a couple of days, the sense, even the dread, of a return to normality is looming. False dawns are frequent, in sport especially. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/06/london-2012-british-racial-attitudes\" title=\"\">Witness the victorious French football team of 1998 that was meant to hail a new, racially inclusive future for that country</a>: it didn't quite work out that way. As today's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/london-2012-team-gb-success-feelgood-factor\" title=\"\">Guardian/ICM poll</a> shows, most Britons are not going to let the Olympics shift their views on immigration: those Somali-born asylum seekers unblessed by Mo Farah's gifts will not be applauded as they walk into the pub. Our problems haven't gone away just because the news bulletins have barely mentioned them for two weeks. While we were studying the medals table, new figures showed the economy flatlining. We still live in the age of austerity, facing unpalatable cuts, governed by institutions many of which we no longer trust. Even the immediate weather forecast is unsettled.</p> <p>But that does not mean we have to cast aside what we just lived through. For we got a glimpse of another kind of Britain. A place which succeeds brilliantly, not least by drawing equally on all its talents, black and white, male and female. A place where money and profit are not the only values, <a href=\"http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2012/08/09/the-volunteers-are-70000-reasons-why-these-games-are-great-and-they-are-changing-britain-for-the-better/\" title=\"\">exemplified by the 70,000 volunteers who made the Games work</a> and showed the world a smiling face while they were at it. A place that reveres not achievement-free celebrity, but astonishing skill, granite determination and good grace, the land not of <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/essex/\" title=\"\">TOWIE</a> but of Bradley Wiggins, Nicola Adams and Laura Trott. A place where patriotism is heartfelt, but of the soft and civic rather than naked and aggressive variety; a place that welcomes visitors from abroad and cheers louder for the Turkish woman who came last in a 3,000m steeplechase heat than it did for the winner.</p> <p>This is the Britain we let ourselves see these past two weeks. It will slip from view as time passes, but we are not condemned to forget it. We don't have to be like the <a href=\"http://www.literarytraveler.com/articles/blaustein_israel/\" title=\"\">long-ago poet who once wrote</a>: \"Did you exist?

  "<p>After more than a decade of toiling to bring internet television to the mass market, Paula Byrne's time has come. A year ago, she sold her technology business to Amazon and now the online retailer has placed her in charge of its biggest engineering hub outside America, a team of several hundred housed in new offices near London's Silicon Roundabout.</p> <p>Amazon is entering the video rental business in a big way. But rather than receiving DVDs through the post, its customers will be watching films and TV series online.</p> <p>The US group has acquired LoveFilm, whose British boss, Simon Calver, has now moved on, and its engineering team has been merged with Byrne's.</p> <p>Together they will create the websites and apps that distribute Amazon's vast library of films and television shows to every shape and size of screen.</p> <p>Their remit is global. Byrne's team have just finished Amazon's video rental app for the iPad. \"You've got a group of people in the UK that isn't just building services for Europe,\" says Byrne, \"We are going to be doing this for Amazon on a worldwide basis. That is such a great thing for the UK economy.\"</p> <p>Amazon is the second American digital giant to plant the stars and stripes in TechCity, another name for the cluster of technology businesses that has formed near Old Street roundabout in east London.</p> <p>This spring, Google Campus opened in the area, offering desk space and mentoring to startups.</p> <p>For Byrne, the buzz is important. She enjoys her lunch hours in Whitecross Street, where street food stalls have revived the local market.</p> <p>\"You can feel it humming. There are people from technology, from media. We have brought hundreds more people like that into the area.\"</p> <p>A Liverpudlian who moved south to study business and marketing at the City of London Polytechnic, Byrne's career was launched in computer games. In the late 1980s, she found herself at Telecomsoft, a subsidiary of BT, doing a brisk trade selling games for Atari and Amiga consoles. In 1995, she was put in charge of developing what was probably the UK's first interactive TV service. The idea was to deliver all the benefits of the internet through the use of the remote control. An awkward alliance between Sky, BT and HSBC bank, it offered email and a limited range of shopping and financial services.</p> <p>The business, Open, was eventually sold to Sky and Byrne then set up on her own.</p> <p>It was her technology that enabled millions of X Factor viewers to propel Will Young, Leona Lewis and others into a pop career and others to eject Katie Price from I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! by pressing their red buttons. Byrne's startup, Pushbutton, pioneered interactive services for Sky and ITV.</p> <p>As domestic broadband speeds increased, she turned her hand to delivering television over the internet. Pushbutton repurposed the iPlayer for BT Vision and helped put LoveFilm on Sony Bravia internet TVs and PlayStation games consoles.</p> <p>At home in Hertfordshire, Byrne's three teenage children already do most of their viewing through the use of games consoles.</p> <p>This is a pattern which is being repeated across the UK. Xboxes with internet connections are now being used to stream films from LoveFilm or its rival Netflix to the family television set. \"Although I've been at this a long time, it feels as if we are only just beginning,\" says Byrne. \"We are here now at this really sweet spot in time. We've got the technology that finally enables this experience that customers have wanted for years.\"</p> <p>The official statistics produced by TV measurement body Barb revealed that, in 2011, 91% of viewing was still live rather than on demand.</p> <p>In homes where internet TV is easy, such as those with a Virgin Media Tivo box, the picture is a little different. Virgin estimates that 1bn on-demand programmes were watched in 2011.</p> <p>Byrne thinks traditional television channels have some years left to run, but that their dominance has already been challenged.</p> <p>\"There are many ways content can be scheduled. For some people, TV channels fulfil that purpose; for others what is much more important is what the people they hang out with recommend. The way people choose what they want to watch is going to become more sophisticated and diverse.\"</p> <p>So Amazon is racing to adapt its service to every screen and gadget on the market. While it has its own tablet, the Kindle Fire, the retailer does not want to limit its potential audience. With a long list of jobs to do, it made sense to buy Byrne's company.</p> <p>Given the attention being paid to Amazon's low tax contribution to the UK, the decision to site a global engineering team in London was well timed politically.</p> <p>Byrne says the move was talent led. \"The UK has always had a great reputation in this industry. What Danny Boyle did in the Olympics opening ceremony summed up the kind of things that the UK is good at, executing things creatively and well,\" said Byrne.</p> <p>Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, has yet to pay a visit to Silicon Roundabout, but two weeks into the office move, Byrne isn't quite prepared for him yet.</p> <p>\"It's like when your in-laws come round, you want everything to be perfect,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Using swear words in church is an abuse of God,\" said the prosecutor, demanding three years jail for the punk band Pussy Riot following their 40-second protest in Moscow's Orthodox cathedral. Their crime was to sing \"Mother of God, chase Putin out\", invoking that young Palestinian woman who desired that the mighty be brought down, the lowly lifted up and the hungry fed. Her story, and that of her son, was also to end up in court. And the charge against him was not wholly dissimilar.</p> <p>To many, swear words are more than mere rudeness. Profanity is a theological category generated by the binary opposition of sacred and profane. As expressed in the book of Leviticus, the things of God are strictly to be separated from the moral and physical corruption of the world. Death, shit and blood represent a threat to God's perfection, just as dirty fingers threaten the perfection of a blank piece of paper. Thus the complex rites of purification for those who would approach the holy.</p> <p>In my own church, St Mary's, Newington, a low altar rail separates the pews from the sanctuary. When a child toddles up towards the altar for a better view of the action, a frisson of uncertainty pervades the congregation. Beyond the altar rail is the holy bit. To some, it feels like the wrong place for nappies and Haribos. And even less appropriate a place for a band called Pussy Riot.</p> <p>It's worth acknowledging that some things feel like they do require particular (though not necessarily legal) protection. Earlier this week my girls had their annual holiday fight. As tempers were lost, one spat on the other's blanket. And by blanket I mean that precious transitional object children cling to as comfort and reassurance. On one level, saliva on a square of muslin hardly feels like the most terrible offence. Yet when a blanket is recognised as a vital part of existential formation, it is an act of particular unpleasantness. Some things are indeed special.</p> <p>The problem comes when the holy is employed as a cover to evade critical scrutiny. Even more so when questionable moral or political ideologies are smuggled into the holy \u2013 from menstruating women being ritually unclean (thus unable to be priests doing holy stuff in the sanctuary) to the Orthodox church's support for Putin. For values thus inscribed within the holy can easily come to regulate the politics of a community in ways that resist any sort of challenge. Then religion becomes an adjunct of totalitarianism. And when this happens a pussy riot is an absolute moral necessity.</p> <p>The legal case against Jesus was that he violated the holy. He was criticised for allowing his disciples to eat without washing properly and for picking corn on the day set aside as holy. He said he was God yet he was born in a filthy stable and willingly laid hands on lepers. He had no problem with being touched by menstruating women or eating with those regarded as unwholesome. In the context of second temple Judaism, this constituted a thoroughgoing deconstruction of holiness \u2013 or, specifically, of the way unquestioned holiness had become an alibi for political injustice. The prophets of the Hebrew scriptures made exactly the same challenge. And being profane is precisely the point.</p> <p>\"We are grateful to those who pray for us,\" said Pussy Riot's lead singer, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/pussy-riot-profile-nadezhda-tolokonnikova\" title=\"\">Nadezhda Tolokonnikova</a>. Yet in so manipulated a political environment as contemporary Russia, it seems too much to hope that these brave women will have a more impartial judge than that blasphemous Hebrew who so upset the state and the religious authorities of his day.</p> <p><strong>Twitter: @giles_fraser</strong></p>",
  "<p>When Chinese authorities announced Gu Kailai's detention on suspicion of killing Neil Heywood, her conviction was all but inevitable. On Thursday she stood trial for premeditated murder and \u2013 according to state media \u2013 she confessed to the crime. \"I will accept and calmly face any sentence and I also expect a fair and just court decision,\" she said in her first reported comments on the case.</p> <p>Gu's position as the wife of a powerful but divisive leader, Bo Xilai, has driven the global fascination with the scandal. But it has also ensued that the British businessman's sudden death remains as opaque as ever.</p> <p>Perry Link of Princeton University compared the case to the mysterious 1971 death of the senior communist leader Lin Biao in a plane crash. \"Something dramatic happened in the high levels of the mafia and we still, today, don't know exactly what. For the Party then, the official narrative was a much more important thing than the truth, and the same will be true for the Gu Kailai story today.\"</p> <p>The official version appears carefully calibrated to justify the trial of a disgraced yet still popular leader's wife, while defending the reputation of the Communist party.</p> <p>\"I suffered a mental breakdown after learning that my son was in jeopardy,\" Gu said, according to the official Xinhua news agency.</p> <p>Heywood and Gu were once so close that she was godmother to one of his children. Yet Gu and her employee Zhang Xiaojun are said to have poisoned the Briton because he had threatened and even imprisoned her only son, Bo Guagua, over a business row.</p> <p>One of those who knew him described it as \"a piece of Party theatre\", with the courts shifting blame on to the foreign victim \"when he, having been murdered, is in no position to speak up\".</p> <p>And emerging accounts of the closed-door hearing at Hefei intermediate people's court include apparently implausible claims and contradictions.</p> <p>What all agree is that Heywood, 41 died in Room 1605 at the secluded Lucky Holiday Hotel in south-western Chongqing, where Bo Xilai was the high profile party secretary. The Briton had been part of Gu's inner circle, but the relationship had cooled; he had flown down to the city at her request.</p> <p>Heywood had moved to China in the Nineties, marrying a local woman but remained very much an old-fashioned patriot, taking pride in his Harrow education and playing croquet. \"He was a very, very nice man \u2013 a classic English gentleman. Men liked him; women liked him,\" said one who knew him well.</p> <p>He told friends he met Bo while living in the north-eastern city of Dalian, after writing to the then-mayor to introduce himself. The link appears to have been useful for Heywood, who introduced foreign firms to key officials, but was also useful to the family. He helped them manage affairs in Britain where Guagua studied at Harrow, getting on so well with him that one friend even thought their closeness might have made Gu jealous.</p> <p>How far he depended on his ties to the family is unclear. He also worked for the Beijing Aston Martin dealership and for Hakluyt, the business intelligence firm formed by former MI6 operatives although the British government explicitly denied he was a spy.</p> <p>One friend said Heywood was \"cagey\" about work. Another said there was an unclear economic link, but thought it insubstantial. In any case, the relationship turned sour about four years ago. \"It was like a lotus root \u2013 it was broken, but there were threads,\" said a friend. \"He did feel hard done by.\",\" said a friend.</p> <p>The official court statement said simply that Gu believed Heywood was a threat to her son's safety after an economic row. A more detailed account has surfaced on Chinese internet sites, purportedly from someone who was in court; though unverifiable, parts of it are confirmed by others with knowledge of the case.</p> <p>The court heard that Gu had introduced Heywood to a major deal that fell through. He demanded millions in compensation and bickered with Guagua over the money \u2013 eventually locking the young man up at a house in the UK. Fearful for her son, Gu took matters into her own hands.</p> <p>For Heywood to threaten the son of one of China's most powerful men, a leader with a reputation for ruthlessness, would have been astoundingly foolish. \"He was not vindictive; he was a nice guy,\" said a friend. \"[And] he was neither crass enough nor stupid enough to threaten them.\"</p> <p>In any case, the incident with Bo Guagua also appeared to have taken place well before Heywood's death. Some wonder if Gu wanted to ensure he could not disclose what he knew about the family's dealings; her husband, the Chongqing party secretary, was a polarising figure under increasing scrutiny ahead of this year's leadership transition.</p> <p>In October last year, Heywood told another friend ruefully: \"I've had a bit of trouble with a Mr Bo,\" but added that it was over. He seemed sanguine about the matter, the friend said. Then came November's last-minute invitation to travel to Chongqing, with Gu's family aide Zhang Xiaojun, also charged with murder. It is not clear why Heywood agreed to go \u2014 he may have hoped to resolve matters \u2013 but on arrival he felt it was a \"menacing situation\", said a friend.</p> <p>All of this makes it even stranger that a man known as a light drinker should have allowed himself to be incapacitated by alcohol. Courtroom accounts suggest Gu arrived at Heywood's hotel on the evening of 13 November with a bottle of Royal Salute whiskey. While three family employees waited outside, she drank with Heywood until he was so inebriated he vomited.</p> <p>When Zhang brought in the poison Gu had previously prepared, she poured it into the incapacitated Briton's mouth. Once confident he was dead, she told Wang Lijun, the city's police chief and her husband's ally, what she had done.</p> <p>What happened next is unclear, but four police officers from Chongqing went on trial in Hefei on Friday for covering up her crime.</p> <p>The body was not found for two days, coincidentally on Gu's birthday. Heywood's family accepted the official verdict of death due to excessive alcohol, UK authorities raised no concerns and he was cremated a few days later. Though friends were suspicious, the matter would have rested there \u2013 but for the police chief Gu had asked to help her.</p> <p>The court reportedly heard that Wang recorded Gu's admission she had killed Heywood. It is thought he was already concerned about an internal party investigation; it is possible he was seeking leverage over Bo.</p> <p>The defence claimed Wang also took two blood samples \u2013 yet found no traces of poison, according to a person in court. A third sample, taken by Wang and tested four months later, found low levels of a toxin \u2013 not enough, it seemed, to kill. More curiously, according to the same courtroom source, the defence claimed Heywood's body, which Gu had left lying on its back, was found sprawled face down \u2013 suggesting a third party had entered the room.</p> <p>Wang confronted Bo with his allegations against Gu in late January or February. He was demoted almost immediately and fled to the US consulate in Chengdu a few days later. That unleashed the train of events culminating in Gu's trial this week. She awaits the verdict and sentencing, which many now suspect will be a suspended death penalty.</p> <p>Whether she will be followed into court by her husband remains to be seen. He is under internal party investigation for disciplinary offences, but some suspect he may yet face criminal charges.</p> <p>Whatever happens, the story now seems set in the world's imagination. Elements of it read like a bad airport novel: the upper-class Englishman with links to former spies, the Dragon Lady armed with poison, the charismatic but ruthless leader and the maverick police chief.</p> <p>But its wider arc has the moral force of a Shakespearean tale of ambition and betrayal. If Gu did indeed kill a former friend to protect her family, her actions appear to have instead ensured its destruction.</p>",
  "<p>Last night, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008tj5q\" title=\"\">BBC2 series Wonderland</a> showed us two young men who had gone up to Oxbridge with the aim of involving themselves in student politics. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/09/young-bright-and-on-the-right\" title=\"\">Young, Bright and On the Right</a> was both awkward and compelling television, exploring the skulduggery and eccentricity of student politics.</p> <p>In recent years, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Conservative_Association\" title=\"\">Oxford Conservative Association</a> (OCA) has become so notorious that it was forced to drop its association with the university after it made headlines in the press when members <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/8870909/Oxford-Tories-nights-of-port-and-Nazi-songs.html\" title=\"\">allegedly sang Nazi songs</a>. This, sadly, was the focus of the show. The BBC provided us with long shots of young men in suits drinking tea, wiping their brows with floral handkerchiefs. It made for a depressing viewing, because behind the superficial details was a story which needs to be told: the importance of these student political societies to their members, and the doors which can be opened by student political involvement.</p> <p>When I began my undergraduate degree at Cambridge, I had come from an excellent school but still one at which there was no political curriculum and few opportunities for political debate. At Cambridge, there were more student political associations than I could have imagined. These institutions serve for many undergraduates as an awakening to the world of politics, a chance to break down the boundaries between us and the people we read about in the media. This opportunity to participate in, rather than just observe, politics is what inspires so many young people into activism and journalism.</p> <p>When I arrived at university, I had never met a politician. By the time I left I had not only met them, but publicly debated with them as well as, journalists, academics, and celebrities. The exposure to opposing points of view was one of the greatest rewards of being a student. Some of my contemporaries have already gone on to stand for election, edit newspapers and forge careers as columnists. The chance to meet and have proper, respectful conversations with people who disagree with you and come from an entirely different upbringing is too often lacking in our secondary school educational system.</p> <p>The beautiful and rarefied setting of both Oxford and Cambridge add an unhelpful patina to the stories of students like Joe Cooke and Chris Monk, who both featured in the programme. If the same series had followed the Liberal Democrat or Labour clubs, the background of seeming wealth and privilege would have been identical, and the opportunities to dine in black tie and drink port the same.</p> <p>Neither Cooke nor Monk were given much opportunity by the editors to explain why they were Conservative. Cooke had come from a northern background and at a young age, his father had been imprisoned. The most moving part of the programme came when Cooke broke down in tears, describing the decision he had made to alter his outward demeanour to fit in: it was crushingly difficult for him to talk about this, and yet we never heard much about the passion and heartfelt ideology which must have pushed him to make this choice.</p> <p>Similarly, Monk was described as being rightwing by his Liberal Democrat parents, but we heard nothing of his beliefs. Monk made efforts to volunteer as a steward at the union, and cosied up to the higher echelons in the association to aid his progress. Despite coming from a very ordinary background, he openly criticised the prospect of widening access to the Conservative association for fear of upsetting the current members. That pressure to fit into a political identity needs to be removed. There is no doubting that the eccentric and somewhat indulgent activities of OCA are beyond the experience of most political activists; what matters most when it comes to student political engagement is that more people step up and become involved.</p> <p>How much of what went on at OCA was the result of the environment in which it occurred, we cannot say. A heady mix of subsidised dinners, ancient buildings and a swollen sense of entitlement can bring out the silliest in most undergraduates. For all prospective applicants reading this, I have to say that there are decent, hardworking and passionate groups of people at Oxford and Cambridge, from all class and economic backgrounds, who are made to feel welcome. Since 2000, 38% of the chairmen and women of the Cambridge University Conservative Association have come from state schools. Only a tiny minority of the people I met acted the way that OCA was portrayed on TV (and the most eccentric, foppish character I knew went on to stand as a Labour candidate).</p> <p>Watching BBC2 last night, you'd have been forgiven for thinking that student politics is a purely dreadful experience. What the show didn't focus on were the opportunities for Joe, Chris and students from any background to take part in our national political conversation. For all the silliness, sadness and scandal, there is lurking behind it a great story about young people having the chance to learn about themselves and to become politically engaged. It's a pity we didn't see more of it.</p>",
  "<p>Millions of players of Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo, World of Warcraft, Starcraft and other online games have been warned to change their passwords after the company revealed that it was hacked on 4 August.</p> <p>Blizzard Entertainment says it has no evidence that the intruders acquired credit card information, billing addresses or players' names.</p> <p>But it said that hackers were able to access other data, including email addresses and answers to players' personal security questions. Blizzard says it doesn't believe such information alone is enough for anyone to gain access to its Battle.net online accounts, which let people play with others around the world online.</p> <p>It warned users to beware of \"phishing\" emails that might purport to come from the company asking people to follow a link to reset passwords. Those should be ignored, and users should instead log in directly on the site using a bookmark.</p> <p>The company also says hackers took encrypted versions of passwords. As a precaution, it is recommending that players change their passwords.</p> <p>Blizzard, which is a division of Activision Blizzard Inc, didn't say how many accounts were affected, but there are millions of accounts on the system.</p> <p>\"We encourage our North American players to change their passwords,\" the company said in <a href=\"http://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/important-security-update-faq\" title=\"\">an FAQ page about the hack</a>. (Battle.net users can <a href=\"https://battle.net/account/management/settings/change-password.html\" title=\"\">click here to log in</a>.)</p> <p>After carrying out a security audit, Blizzard now fears that the hackers have gained access to the data used to reset or change passwords, including \"secret\" questions and answers. Mobile users will also be encouraged to update their software.</p> <p>\"We urge all members of our community to closely monitor all of their online accounts,\" the company said.</p> <p>The hack is the latest in a growing list where companies holding millions of accounts have seen databases compromised. While in theory encrypted passwords should be safe \u2013 and Blizzard used a method called \"salting\" to make encrypted passwords essentially uncrackable \u2013 other elements such as secret questions and answers may give the hackers the clues they need to break into other systems.</p> <p>But Blizzard won praise from Rob Cotton, the NCC Group chief executive, for its action.</p> <p>\"Blizzard should be given a lot of credit for its response,\" he said. \"It's been clear and open about what happened, apologised to users and made assurances that it will improve its security systems. Other organisations and policy makers should take note, as this is the kind of transparency we need if we're to combat the cyber threat effectively.</p> <p>\"Even though Blizzard had what it believed to be tight security measures in place, cyber criminals still managed infiltrate its systems. It highlights the importance of regular testing, external audit and continually updating security measures to stay ahead of the latest threats.\"</p> <p>Blizzard said that it learned of the hack on 4 August, but that it took until now to announce it because it had been working \"around the clock\" to work out how the hack was done, and what data was accessed. \"Our first priority was to re-secure our network, and from there we worked simultaneously on the investigation and on informing our global player base. We wanted to strike a balance between speed and accuracy in our reporting and worked diligently to serve both equally important needs,\" it said.</p> <p>Online games companies are an increasingly popular target for hacking attacks because they often hold user names, emails, passwords and credit card or other payment details. Even if the hackers cannot get access to the details directly, grabbing a large number of emails can set them up for phishing attacks which may yield some users' passwords and other details, or help to plant viruses on machines via phishing emails with malicious attachments.</p>",
  "<p>Officials planning for the 2012 Olympics embraced the opportunity to clean up and rebuild a vast parcel of east London, which had become an industrial dumping ground over the past century. Ken Livingstone, the London mayor at the time of the Olympic bid in 2005, famously said the Olympic project would spur a massive regeneration of this area over several decades, interrupted by a few weeks of sport.</p> <p>Besides the world class sports venues that will remain, the site now offers one of Europe's largest urban parks, a much-improved communications and transportation infrastructure and, eventually, thousands of new homes. These visible improvements have certainly engaged the media and the public, and many see this transformation as the long-term legacy of the Games.</p> <p>But the more lasting legacy from the Games may be less obvious to the typical spectator, according to several sustainability practitioners, as London will pass to future event organisers and suppliers a pack of new standards and best practices in sustainable event management, construction and sourcing.</p> <p>During my <a href=\"http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/q-and-a-greening-the-london-olympics/\" title=\"\">recent conversation</a> with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/david-stubbs\" title=\"\">David Stubbs</a>, head of sustainability for the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/the-people-delivering-the-games/locog/\" title=\"\">London Organising Committee</a> (LOCOG), he highlighted two of these standards in particular: the new Event Sustainability Management System from the International Organization for Standardization (<a href=\"http://www.iso20121.org\" title=\"\">ISO 20121</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/sustainability/food-vision/\" title=\"\">Food Vision</a>, a blueprint for sustainable food sourcing.</p> <p>ISO standards touch just about every business segment, but until London 2012, no international, auditable standard on sustainability was available to the event sector. Preparing for the games was the spark that helped finalise ISO 20121, which was officially launched in June, and helped LOCOG put sustainability considerations at the heart of the planning process, said Stubbs.</p> <p>Rather than dictating specific targets or sustainability measures, the new standard enables organisers and suppliers to first identify key areas of impact that will be unique to their event. It then guides them through the process of gathering input from stakeholders, developing plans and setting goals to reduce negative impacts, measuring progress and reporting results.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sustainableeventsltd.com/fiona-pelham/\" title=\"\">Fiona Pelham</a>, who chaired the ISO 20121 committee, describes the approach as a \"way of working\" as opposed to a rigid checklist with a one-size-fits-all set of criteria.</p> <p>\"It's about identifying your concerns and understanding what you can control and influence because each venue is unique with its own particular issues that may relate to the environment, social impacts, or economic concerns,\" says Pelham.</p> <p>Representatives from 30 countries, many from the event industry, helped develop the standard, which Pelham expects will be used for events of all sizes going forward, including the upcoming Olympic Games in Russia and Brazil.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/sustainability/food-vision/\" title=\"\">Food Vision</a> programme, which was codified in 2009, attempts to mitigate the enormous footprint caused by producing and delivering food for events, which for the London Games has been estimated at 14 million meals across 40 venues.</p> <p>The program required producers and suppliers to adhere to a number of food-related standards (like Fairtrade, <a href=\"http://www.msc.org\" title=\"\">Marine Stewardship Council</a> certified fish and <a href=\"http://www.redtractor.org.uk/Home\" title=\"\">Farm Assured Red Tractor</a>) that cover just about every consequence of the food life cycle, including quality and labelling, animal welfare, environmental impacts, and labor issues.</p> <p>Also included in the vision was the commitment to source foods from Britain whenever possible. The programme applied to food arranged by LOCOG, which covers most of the food that will be served during the games. An additional 10 to 20 percent will be served by sponsors like McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Cadbury, who voluntarily applied some of the standards.</p> <p>Several large organisations are already looking at implementing these food sourcing standards, according to Kath Dalmeny, who served on the <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/olympicfood/olympic_food_standards/\" title=\"\">advisory group</a> that developed the programme. She also serves as policy director of <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/\" title=\"\">Sustain</a>, an organisation that now runs <a href=\"http://www.foodlegacy.org\" title=\"\">Food Legacy</a>, promoting uptake of the Food Vision standards.</p> <p>\"We are working with lots of organisations including the mayor's office and other government departments, the Metropolitan Police, the prison service and parts of the armed forces - all of them major buyers of food,\" she says.</p> <p>Many of the specified standards are UK-specific, while others have an international reach. Still, because the framework sets out clear principles and themes, it should be applicable anywhere with local adaptation, says Dalmeny.</p> <p>The examples above highlight just two of the new standards now available to event planners and the vast supply chain that supports them. Among many other outcomes from the Games, the <a href=\"http://www.cslondon.org\" title=\"\">Commission for a Sustainable London 2012</a>, an independent watchdog, will be evaluating their impact and relevance for future events.</p> <p>Shaun McCarthy, chair of the commission, asserts that you can never have a zero impact Games, but other knowledge, experience and best practices that emerge can help offset this impact.</p> <p>\"The key principle we work with at the Commission is that there is no such thing as sustainable Olympic Games,\" says McCarthy. \"Using all that resource to watch people run around is not a sustainable thing to do, unless you can make a difference in a wider sense.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The City has welcomed the news that one of its own is to become the new chairman of <strong>Barclays</strong> in the wake of the bank's involvement in the libor scandal.</p> <p>Sir David Walker, a former Morgan Stanley executive, Bank of England and Treasury official and the author of a key report on the banking system, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/09/barclays-sir-david-walker-new-chairman\" title=\"\">named on Thursday night</a> as a replacement for current Barclays' chairman Marcus Agius.</p> <p>Barclays' shares reacted with a 4.45p gain to 183.4p, making them the biggest riser in an otherwise moribund market.</p> <p>Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said the new chairman ticked all the right boxes:</p> <blockquote> We struggle to see how the board could have found a better candidate for the role given his long career in financial services, including both investment banking and retail banking, close connections with the Treasury and Bank of England, and his keen interest in corporate governance via the Walker Review. Importantly, he also has no previous ties with Barclays that we are aware of, making him the independent appointment that we had deemed a necessity if Barclays is to clean up its reputation. <br> His first job will be to find a new chief executive, for which we also view an outside appointment as being essential. Once this move has been completed, we would expect further senior heads to roll as the company looks to further clean up its image. Going forward, we expect Barclays to adopt a more conservative strategy than it has in the past, which could see the aggressive expansion story that has been pursued by the investment bank being de-emphasised somewhat. This is something we would welcome as we believe investment banking is likely to be a low return industry over the long-run, given planned regulatory change. </blockquote> <p>Ian Gordon at Investec agreed the appointment was a good one, politically safe and usefully quick, although he added that investors should not obsess over the chairman's profile:</p> <blockquote> The chief executive appointment is arguably more critical to harvesting [former boss] Bob Diamond's rich legacy, and above all else, we see Barclays as a strong, defensively positioned bank trading at the wrong price. It has outperformed all UK banks since its libor-related sell-off. <br> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> closed down 36.5p at 1326.5p as the fallout continued from Monday's accusations by a New York regulator that the bank was involved in illegal transactions with Iran.</p> <p>Although its shares have recovered from their lows - they slumped to \u00a310.92 at one point - they are still more than 15% down since the scandal broke. Investors feared Standard could lose its US banking licence, although it came out fighting against the charges.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> dipped 4.40 points to 5847.11 after five days of rises, in the wake of worse than expected Chinese trade data, which showed lower than forecast imports and exports and raised fears of a sharp slowdown in the country's economy.</p> <p>But over the week the leading index has climbed 60 points - albeit in thin trading with the usual summer lull exaggerated by the rival attractions of the Olympics.</p> <p><strong>Prudential</strong> put on 6p to 810p following a 13% rise in half year operating profits to \u00a31.16bn.</p> <p>Rival <strong>Aviva</strong> recovered 6.9p to 323.6p after Thursday's dip in the wake of a larger than expected drop in profits. Deutsche Bank raised its target from 350p to 370p following the figures, with a buy recommendation.</p> <p><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> was steady at 350.6p. The retailer has been in the doldrums since its recent trading update disappointed investors, with the exception of a burst of excitement early last week on renewed takeover speculation.</p> <p>But Morgan Stanley, which acts as the retailer's broker, believes the fall has been overdone. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Whilst M&amp;S's first quarter trading update was poor, we think many commentators have over-reacted to it. We retain our equalweight rating for now, but would encourage investors to buy the shares on weakness. </blockquote> <p>It said M&amp;S's food business, which accounts for half its sales, was outperforming most of its quoted peers, while the clothing business, while struggling at the moment, had been gaining market share in recent years:</p> <blockquote> M&amp;S consensus earnings per share forecasts for 2012 are broadly in line with those when Marc Bolland took over as chief executive in May 2010 (despite the macro-economic situation having weakened significantly). </blockquote> <p>Reports that bankers were lining the retailer up as a \u00a36bn bid target after its recent decline put some life into the shares on Monday, although analysts were unconvinced by the tale.</p> <p>Still with retailers, <strong>Ocado</strong> dropped 2p to 71p after Panmure Gordon analyst Philip Dorgan said the online grocer might breach its covenants this year.</p> <p><strong>Dixons Retail </strong>rose 1.7% to 16.27p after it paid \u20ac10m to take full ownership of European online business Pixmania. It is buying the 22% held by the company's founders to take its shareholding to 99%, allowing it to full day to day control of the loss making business. The remaining 1% is held by staff. Pixmania supplies an e-merchant platform for Dixons as well as services to other businesses. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> Dixons says that this move will enable it \"to take the decisive actions necessary to improve Pixmania's performance\" (like closing it down?). </blockquote> <p>Kate Calvert at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> Pixmania last year lost \u00a319.8m, and we are forecasting similar losses in the current year. We view this as a positive step as management needs to address the weak performance of Pixmania and its southern European businesses, though this will take time given the impact austerity measures are likely to have on consumer discretionary spending going forward. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Intertek</strong>, which supplies testing services for a range of products from toys to oil and minerals, added 6p to \u00a327.84 after Citigroup raised its price target from \u00a328 to \u00a331.5. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Intertek offers the purest available exposure to global consumer testing's attractive economics. It also provides exposure to the [testing industry] consolidation story, where Intertek looks to be both acquirer and potential target. <br> As the smallest of the three testing operators, Intertek can still make a material impact on its equity value through mid-sized (\u00a3100m plus) deals, as demonstrated by 2011's acquisition of Moody International [for \u00a3450m]. </blockquote> <p>Finally, <strong>Flybe</strong> fell 15% to 64p after the regional airline cut its full year revenue target due to the weak consumer environment and high fuel prices.</p>",
  "<p>Americans don't do self-deprecation. Whether it's the world's biggest ball of string or the grandest canyon or the fastest swimmer or the bounciest gymnasts, when we do something great we want everyone to know about it. Which doesn't always make us popular. Or trustworthy. In Texas, where hyperbole is second nature, they talk about a person being \"all hat and no cattle\".</p> <p>But as Londoners have discovered, being all cattle and no hat is no picnic either. Grumbling is the British national pastime, so it was hardly surprising that the months before the Olympic opening ceremony saw commentators loudly complaining about the impending nightmare as the much-abused London transport system struggled to cope with the hordes of spectators. Not to mention the queues at Heathrow.</p> <p>The brace position even applied to your sporting expectations. Yes, British athletes had done very well in Athens and Beijing. Some of them were even coming back for a third helping \u2013 and this time you would have a home field advantage. Still, curbing your enthusiasm seemed to come naturally. So for the first few days, when Britain's medal haul was still looking a bit spare, and the weather looked like it might revert to type, Londoners seemed almost happy preparing for the worst.</p> <p>Of course you didn't mean it. I've lived in Britain long enough to learn that \"muddling through\" is Brit-speak for what any other culture would describe as cheerful, efficient competence. But when it turned out lots of other people did believe you \u2013 with the Daily Mail revelling in photos of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181313/Deserted-London-2012-Shops-theatres-businesses-visitor-levels-fall-THIRD-fears-Games-travel-chaos.html\" title=\"\">empty streets and shops</a> \u2013 the nation became briefly caught up in the comfortable, inevitable process of distributing blame. But what happens now that British athletes have done the country proud, the games are set for a stunning success \u2013 and Danny Boyle may have single-handedly saved the NHS?</p> <p>First of all, try to enjoy what remains of these games. Visitor numbers may have been below expectations, but after the last two weeks the whole world knows that while the weather may be unpredictable, London has the kettle on, the welcome mat out, the vacancy sign lit up and a fridge full of cold beer (for those of us who like it that way) ready for guests.</p> <p>No matter what Mitt Romney may think, the global audience has also been reminded of why London won the Olympics in the first place: it's one of the most diverse cities on the planet with more different kinds of people eating more different kinds of food and wearing more different kinds of clothes and playing more different kinds of music than just about anywhere else.</p> <p>No matter where you come from, you can be sure that someone in London speaks your language. If that sounds like hyperbole, you can sue me. The fact that London is nothing like Salt Lake City is all to the good.</p> <p>While we're at it, perhaps it's time to give the whole self-deprecation thing a rest. Sure it's funny to fool us foreigners. And clearly some people find the shy-bumbling-stammering-incompetent act charming. But it seems like the days when the superiority of everything British went without saying have gone \u2013 and with them the assumption that constant complaints about life in what is after all one of the most prosperous, most pleasant, most civilised of cities couldn't possibly be meant to be taken seriously.</p> <p>My kids' friends have a set of hand signals for socially problematic occasions, ranging from the \"awkward turtle\" \u2013 when the subject of gossip suddenly enters a room \u2013 to the \"casual racism swan\" for remarks too obnoxious to just let pass but not worth a major confrontation. Maybe someone should invent a self-deprecating duck? Or an ironically insincere elephant? Until then, you'll just have to say you didn't really mean it.</p>",
  "<p>The US government slashed its forecast for drought-hit corn production by 17% on Friday, raising fears of a new global food crisis and sending some commodity prices to record levels.</p> <p>The US department of agriculture said corn output would only reach 10.8bn bushels for 2012-13, while yields were likely to be 123.4 bushels per acre \u2013 the lowest return for 17 years.</p> <p>Predicted soybean production has also been slashed from 3.05bn bushels four weeks ago to 2.7bn on Friday as farmers see crops devastated by the country's worst drought in more than half a century.</p> <p>The latest reduction in estimates propelled corn futures on the Chicago commodity exchange to $8.30 a bushel and accelerated a 60% increase in prices over the last two months.</p> <p>The US is the biggest producer of corn, soybeans and wheat in the world and a poor harvest means prices will rise and stockpiles will remain depleted.</p> <p>The key midwest growing area has been hit by the worst drought in 56 years. The department of agriculture earlier this week said that half of the nation's corn crop was rated poor to very poor while the latest US drought monitor map showed conditions continuing to worsen.</p> <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported on Wednesday that the first seven months of 2012 were the warmest on record for the nation; temperatures in July broke a record high that was set in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.</p> <p>Some fear that growing signs of shortages will prompt some countries to impose export bans or make panic purchases, as they did in 2008, during the last dramatic price spike.</p> <p>\"Several urgent actions must be taken to address the current situation to prevent a potential global food price crisis,\" said Shenggen Fan, head of the International Food Policy Research Institute, an agricultural think tank funded by the World Bank.</p> <p>He said countries should reduce the amount of grain used for biofuels, reigniting the \"food not fuel\" debate about whether valuable land should be devoted to growing corn for use as ethanol on the forecourt at a time of rising food costs.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) at the United Nations, said he wanted to see a halt in US government-backed production of ethanol, which is mixed with petrol to make \"greener\" fuel. </p> <p>\"An immediate, temporary suspension of that [US government] mandate would give some respite to the market and allow more of the crop to be channelled towards food and feed uses,\" he said.</p> <p>The FAO's food price index, which measures monthly cost changes for a food basket of cereals, oilseeds and others, has hit 213 points, up six points on a month ago.</p> <p>Senior economists at the agency warned there was the potential for the situation to develop like the food crisis seen in 2007 and 2008, when there were violent protests against the price of food in countries such as Egypt and Haiti.</p> <p>There are further concerns about agricultural yields, with warnings from Japan of more bad weather emanating from a recurrence of the El Ni\u00f1o storm patterns.</p> <p>The rise in corn and soybean prices has also brought back a debate over the role of financial speculators in the commodity markets, with reports that Commerzbank and two of its peers are withdrawing from certain food-related investments.</p> <p>\"Climbing prices are creating reputational risk for banks,\" Alexis Dawance, a former manager of the agricultural-focused Global Agricap Fund, told Reuters. \"The big grain traders probably have much more impact in food and commodity trading, but this is part of the bigger picture, with all the fat cat-bashing that has been going on... if food prices continue to rise you will see this happening more and more.\"</p> <p>Responding to the surge in food prices, the British-based charity Oxfam warned that the developing world would be hit hardest. \"This is not some gentle wake-up call \u2013 it's the same global alarm that's been screaming at us since 2008,\" said Hannah Stoddart, Oxfam's head of economic justice policy.</p> <p>\"The combination of rising prices and forecast low reserves means the world is facing a double danger. As usual, it will be people in developing countries who will be hit the hardest, with millions who are currently 'just getting by' starting to go hungry as a result.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1962, the writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/aug/08/edinburghfilmfestival2003.fiction\" title=\"\">Alexander Trocchi </a>complained that Scotland was \"turgid, petty, provincial\". It would be hard to make such a claim today, not as the Edinburgh festivals spark into full life this weekend. The fringe has already been under way for a week; on Saturday it is joined by the Edinburgh international festival and the Edinburgh international book festival. Over three weeks, cultural adventures range from the unveiling of <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on/zadie-smith\" title=\"\">Zadie Smith's new novel</a> to Valery Gergiev's conducting the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/lso1\" title=\"\">complete Brahms symphonies </a>to a <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/folespoir\" title=\"\">four-hour theatrical marathon </a>from a world-famous French company visiting the UK for the first time in 20 years.</p> <p>When Trocchi made his accusations \u2013 likening the nation's atmosphere to \"stale porridge\" \u2013 he was speaking at the 1962 Edinburgh writers' conference. That event launched the career of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/williamburroughs\" title=\"\">William Burroughs</a>, had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/jun/10/rebecca-west-forgotten-vorticist\" title=\"\">Rebecca West</a> suggesting that literary critics should be poisoned at birth, and saw writers almost come to blows: Trocchi claimed \"sodomy\" was the basis of his writing, while <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=1557\" title=\"\">poet Hugh MacDiarmid</a> denounced him as \"cosmopolitan scum\".</p> <p>This year's Edinburgh book festival is celebrating 50 years since that momentous conference by restaging it. This time it will be writers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alismith\" title=\"\">Ali Smith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/ahdafsoueif\" title=\"\">Ahdaf Soueif</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/irvinewelsh\" title=\"\">Irvine Welsh</a> leading discussions on topics including the future of the novel and censorship \u2013 much the same issues, in fact, as were debated in 1962.</p> <p>According to Nick Barley, the book festival's director, \"the questions asked then remain as important now, if not more so. We seem to have reached a kind of endpoint in western culture and to be on the edge of something else, brought about by the information age and the global economic crisis. It's worth asking: what role will this strange 19th-century literary form called the novel play in this new age? Is it still relevant? Is the age of experiment and the avant-garde over? How does the novel relate to the world we live in \u2013 does it merely reflect the world or can it be a driver for change?\" He added: \"I won't promise fist fights, but if one or two people don't fall out I will be amazed.\" He said that he wanted the event to be in \"a new spirit of open and frank discussion\" \u2013 branching out from the book-festival formula of authors talking about their new books.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/09/nathan-englander-wins-frank-oconnor\" title=\"\">Nathan Englander</a>, author of this year's critically admired story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/01/what-we-talk-anne-frank\" title=\"\">What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank</a>, who is to chair a session on style versus content, added: \"Novelists today are painfully supportive and there's hardly a vendetta between us, just a little occasional flaming on Twitter. Try as we might, we just can't drink as hard as they did in 1962. But if we manage a good fight, it will probably be about time.\"</p> <p>The Edinburgh international festival is branching out, too, experimenting with something the fringe does as a matter of course \u2013 popping up where audiences least expect it. Before its official launch, it has already unveiled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/10/edinburgh-run-speed-of-light?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Speed of Light</a>, a vast community-created spectacle that crossbreeds hi-tech digital light show with land art. Employing 4,000 volunteer runners and walkers wearing digital lights, it is occupying one of the most dramatic spaces in the cityscape: Arthur's Seat, <a href=\"http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/arthurseat/geology/geology.html\" title=\"\">the craggy extinct volcano </a>that lours over Edinburgh. Fragments of the spectacle \u2013 resembling constellations forming or reforming, or sea creatures unspooling across the ocean floor \u2013 can be glimpsed from the city. But the best views are reserved for those who ascend the peak on one of the nightly guided walking tours.</p> <p>\"A festival is nothing but a pop-up, in a way,\" said Jonathan Mills, the director of the Edinburgh international festival. \"But we're trying to do it on a large scale with some of the finest, most important and innovative artists in the world. We're constantly asking ourselves what the festival can be, who it's for.\"</p> <p>Mills has spent nearly \u00a3500,000 constructing three temporary theatre spaces in an exhibition hall <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18927634\" title=\"\">next to Edinburgh airport</a>. Audiences will be bussed out to experience spectacular shows including <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/folespoir\" title=\"\">Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil's Naufrag\u00e9s du Fol Espoire</a>, four hours loosely based on a Jules Verne story, directed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_Mnouchkine\" title=\"\">Ariane Mnouchkine</a>. There will be a cinematic version of <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/macbeth\" title=\"\">Macbeth by the young Polish company TR Warszawa</a>, to be live-streamed on the Guardian website on Monday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the fringe continues apace. Next week sees the premiere of Chris Goode's much anticipated play <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk/whats-on/monkey-bars/\" title=\"\">Monkey Bars</a> at the Traverse Theatre, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review\" title=\"\">Mies Julie</a>, the South African version of the Strindberg play that has become a real Edinburgh hit, continues at the Assembly Mound.</p> <p>One of the more avant-garde features of the fringe in recent years has been <a href=\"http://www.forestfringe.co.uk/paper-stages-edinburgh-2012/\" title=\"\">Forest Fringe</a>. Lacking a venue this year, it is launching a book tonight containing instructions for performances that readers can create themselves.</p> <p>For art lovers, a multi-site sound installation by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2012/aug/09/olympics-2012-art-susan-philipsz-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Susan Philipsz</a>, the Turner-prizewinning artist, is responding to the sound of Edinburgh Castle's daily one o'clock gun, while the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghartfestival.com/exhibitions/the_fruitmarket_gallery/\" title=\"\">Fruitmarket gallery</a> is showing the diaries, full of paintings, poems and photographs, of the German artist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Roth\" title=\"\">Dieter Roth</a>.</p>",

  "<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-belafonte-locarno-mitt-romney-359192\" title=\"\">interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a>, the legendary entertainer and long-time political activist Harry Belafonte spoke frankly and courageously about the current state of injustice and inequality in the world. His comments included a lament that has sparked some debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think that one of the great abuses of this modern time is that we should have had such high-profile artists, powerful celebrities. But they have turned their back on social responsibility. That goes for Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 for example. Give me Bruce Springsteen and now you're talking. I really think he is black.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Is this a fair assessment of the current state of black celebrity? It is undeniable that today's top black artists and celebrities have the greatest leverage, power, visibility and global influence of any period. It is also true that few speak openly, regularly and publicly on behalf of social justice. Most remain remarkably quiet about the conditions that the majority of black people face.</p> <p>This is not to discount their philanthropic efforts. Often, celebrities take on non-controversial issues and or simply use their celebrity indirectly as a fundraising tool. But the kind of actions for which Belafonte, James Baldwin and others were known \u2013 marching with civil rights protesters under threat of death by citizen or police violence \u2013 is rare among modern superstars. Doing fundraisers is important, but unless it's a very controversial issue, that kind of giving is not terribly sacrificial; it's a feel-good decision for some and for others it's a cost of doing business. The current state of affairs calls for more visible courage than this.</p> <p>Black unemployment has recently been at what some call depression-era levels of around 18%. The drop-out rates for young black people are staggering and have lifelong effects. Although black people make up around 12% of the population, they make up over 40% of those incarcerated in prisons. Poverty levels have risen across the board, but in the black community it is catastrophic: 40% of black children are born into poverty today, a number that rivals the poverty rate of the pre-civil rights victories of the 1960s.</p> <p>How can so many high-profile artists have so little to say about all this?</p> <p>Belafonte's lament illuminates a fundamental shift in black popular culture. As black artists have gone mainstream, their traditional role has shifted. No longer the presumed cultural voice of the black collective social justice, it is now heavily embedded in mass cultural products controlled by the biggest conglomerates in the world.</p> <p>Even relatively tepid statements have to be managed and walked back. In the aftermath of Katrina, Kanye West said on national television during a fundraising telathon that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pVTrnxCZaQ\" title=\"\">George W Bush didn't care about black people</a>. Any close examination of the government's post-Katrina response to black New Orleans or the impact of Bush policies and alliances on black America generally would give credence to this view. But West was challenged to and then compelled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/11/kanye-west-apologises-george-bush\" title=\"\">to apologise</a>. Why, and to what end?</p> <p>Some blame the artists for being sell-outs, while others blame the corporations for leaving artists little choice but to ply their trade in this terrain and keep quiet. It's the price of the ticket to be successful at the highest levels. So, perhaps in exchange for not talking openly about the danger of what Belafonte called \"unbridled capitalism\", highly rewarded artists are given prime access to corporate-controlled culture markets. Either way, the balance of power has shifted toward artistic success being determined by market success. And, many artists and fans have internalised the frightening collapse of the two.</p> <p>There are important exceptions to this trend. Rapper <a href=\"http://newsone.com/2027865/lupe-fiasco-barack-obama/\" title=\"\">Lupe Fiasco calling Obama a baby killer and terrorist</a> for ordering drone attacks that kill innocent people is a rare and risky one. It would be exhilarating to see the likes of Will Smith, Tyler Perry, Oprah Winfrey and others at that level of celebrity power marching against police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/nypd-stop-frisk-justice-department1\" title=\"\">stop and frisk</a> policies and the high levels of incarceration of black youth in the prison industrial complex.</p> <p>In the history of black culture, popular music and art has played an extraordinary role in keeping the spirit alive under duress, challenging discrimination and writing the soundtrack to freedom movements. Visionary artists such as Harry Belafonte, Paul Robeson, <a href=\"http://womenshistory.about.com/od/aframerwriters/p/hansberry.htm\" title=\"\">Lorraine Hansberry</a> and Nina Simone were shaped by, and contributed to this tradition, not least because much of their celebrity derived from community support not challenged through corporate marketing strategy.</p> <p>The current expansion of the cultural arm of predatory capitalism threatens the power and vitality of this tradition by limiting visible spaces, audience appetite and celebrity influence of those who speak truth to power and sing the songs of justice.</p>",
  "<h2>WE LIKE COMMUNITY. WE DON'T LIKE COMMUNITY SHIELD</h2> <p>Special Team GB underpants? Check. A to Z of Skegness? Check. Forty-eight cans of mood-enhancer? Check. Pele-endorsed pills? Shhh. The Fiver's off on holiday readers. Sunny Lincolnshire awaits. All the non-stop football and Big Games have worn this poor tea-timely email as thin as the lonely island on top of Alan Shearer's head. But what's this? (Fiver reverses its rusty Vauxhall Corsa back up its driveway and bangs head on steering wheel five, six, seven, eight, nine times). It's only the Community Shield this Sunday!</p> <p>\"Every time you play you want to win and this is the first chance for us to pick up a trophy in the new season. I'm as hungry as I have ever been, going into this season,\" burped Chelsea's Gary Cahill, who will likely start alongside England's Brave John Terry against Manchester City, if the Chelsea captain has finished hugging Big Cup and taking credit for things he has played no part in.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea boss Roberto Di Matteo has been busy this summer trying to iron out the wrinkles in his crinkly squad. Marko Marin, Oscar and humility's Eden Hazard have been brought in for a Uefa Financial Fair Play-busting \u00a364m. They are young, tricky upstarts who may make Chelsea worth watching again if not worth cancelling your Lincolnshire holiday for. The 19-year-old Thorgan Hazard, who has never played a competitive match and appears to have joined Chelsea just to make his older brother Eden \u2013 and perhaps even Fernando Torres \u2013 feel good about himself, has also arrived.</p> <p>What does this mean for Sunday's match? The Fiver doesn't know and doesn't care, but at least we've got past the three-par minimum limit to the bit where Manchester City players have to say something about the match at Villa Park. Yes Villa Park, not Wembley, readers. That's a real fact for you, right there. Big Games 1-0 Football.</p> <p>\"I have enjoyed the summer break and spending quality time with my family and managed to relax and recharge my batteries,\" said Manchester City's Yaya Toure, rubbing sand and the pleasant scent of summer breeze into the Fiver's face. \"I'm ready for the new season. There is a real spring in everyone's step and it's been great to catch up with the guys again.\"</p> <p>One man who isn't happy and relaxed is Roberto Mancini who, despite having spent more money than most small nations possess, is miffed that City have not added to a squad that won the Premier League title at a cost of around \u00a3500m. \"After four months, I don't know what to say. You need to ask Brian Marwood [the sporting director],\" he grumbled. \"I am not the sporting director. I can't say anything about players. I am not happy but I don't know what to say,\" he said, saying exactly what he wanted to say.</p> <p>Neither Mario Balotelli nor David Silva will play for City on Sunday. Both players have been allowed further time to rest and recuperate after busy summers. Sigh.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Njoying twitter.com/LFC tonight.

Once a textile district, now inhabited by the culturally curious, this is the 'hip' part of Manchester city centre. The area is full of design agencies, trendy music venues, bars, cafes, a craft centre and fashion boutiques and is perfectly suited to the dynamic visual delights of a local LomoWall from Lomography. The street art landscape that is developing in Manchester currently is totally inspiring to us at Lomography and the ethos behind this sits with both our ideas and those of our community. We are absolutely delighted to have this first permanent LomoWall exhibition hosted by CityCo and TCS in the Piccadilly Basin.</p> </blockquote> <p>The project is part of the <a href=\"http://summer.visitmanchester.com/events/event/2012-canal-festival/\">2012 Canal Festival</a>. Those responsible for the LomoWall initiative include the Piccadilly Partnership, CityCo, Manchester's city centre management company, and Town Centre Securities, owners of Piccadilly Basin and previous owners of the Rochdale canal.</p> <p>Alexandra King, director of Piccadilly Partnership, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>This is a new landmark on the Northern Quarter landscape, here in the heart of the Piccadilly Basin. The LomoWall adds to the street art scene in this part of the city centre and will become a visitor attraction in its own right. We are very proud to host it and to have the world's first permanent LomoWall is a real honour. It's a welcome addition to the urban landscape.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394503872\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344503838825/Lomowall3.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester lomo wall\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another view.

  "<p>The USA's women's team won their fourth Olympic Gold medal in London. Here's a look at the top five moments from yet another successful Olympic campaign.</p> <h2>Lloyd strikes gold</h2> <p>After picking the ball up just inside the Japanese half, Carli Lloyd had one thing on her mind as she surged towards the south end of Wembley Stadium: shoot. And when she did her shot rifled into the top corner, netting the USA's, and Lloyd's, second goal of the game. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/09/olympics-2012-football-usa-japan-live\">The stunner gave the Americans a commanding 2-0 lead with 54 minutes gone in the Olympic final</a>.</p> <p>Lloyd's delight as she ran to the bench in celebration will be one of the lasting images from the women's tournament. The US were being outplayed at times by the Japanese, who resembled the female equivalent of Arsenal: full of panache, attacking threat and poise but eager to try one pass too many in the search for a perfect goal. The US typified the approach most recently deployed by Chelsea. Strong, resilient and full of pace, they soaked up Japanese pressure \u2013 thanks to some tremendous saves from Hope Solo \u2013 before foraging forward on counter attacks and set pieces.</p> <p>Lloyd personified the USA's battling approach, marshaling the midfield then supporting Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach up top. Her game-winning goal came courtesy of the intelligent running of the aforementioned duo, as they opened up space centrally for Lloyd. But she still had to find a finish from 25 yards out, and the US No10 did just that.</p> <p>The 30-year-old didn't start the first match, but scored a beauty after coming on as a sub. She kept her place in the side for the rest of the tournament. When she was needed most, Lloyd delivered on the big stage, scoring a team-high four goals from midfield.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.ooyala.com/player.js?video_pcode=9xamM6_vYjbNiMkmp1Iv7Wq8UPed&amp;height=369&amp;embedCode=hqMGpsNTrwCm87umujybGysSv7j9H7bM&amp;deepLinkEmbedCode=hqMGpsNTrwCm87umujybGysSv7j9H7bM&amp;width=460\"> <script src=\"https://player.ooyala.com/player.js?video_pcode=9xamM6_vYjbNiMkmp1Iv7Wq8UPed&height=369&embedCode=hqMGpsNTrwCm87umujybGysSv7j9H7bM&deepLinkEmbedCode=hqMGpsNTrwCm87umujybGysSv7j9H7bM&width=460\"></script> </figure>  <p></p> <h2>Hampden comeback</h2> <p>Despite so much hope and optimism surrounding the USA's campaign, everything seemed to be crashing to the ground after just 20 minutes of their opening match, against France. Two down and reeling at Hampden Park in Glasgow, the experience and leadership of the US side shone through. Instead of imitating rabbits caught in the headlights of a juggernaut, the US dug in, got back to basics and soon found themselves on level terms.</p> <p>A quick-fire double from the deadly duo of Wambach and Morgan got the game back to 2-2 at the break. Then Lloyd hammered home a trademark strike to put the US in the lead, leaving Morgan to add an insurance goal for the 4-2 win.</p> <p>As soon as the US grabbed one back, they were flying. Confidence exuded from every American player as Wambach bullied the French defense and Morgan nipped in behind with her electric pace. After beating the world champions, Japan, 4-1 in a warm-up tournament in Sweden, the US seemed dead certs to progress to the gold-medal game for the fifth consecutive time. That looked in jeopardy during a topsy-turvy first half against Les Blues, but the USA's quality shone through as they kick-started their Olympic title defense in emphatic style.</p> <h2>Canadian rivalry reignited</h2> <p>OK. So if <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/07/the-fiver-women-football-olympics?\">The Fiver names a game \"the greatest knockout match in major-tournament football since 1982\"</a>, you know it was a cracker.</p> <p>Given that it was between the US and Canada, you'll understand why this match will go down in the record books. The rivalry is now bubbling intensely, after <a href=\"http://www.womenssoccerunited.com/video/usa-beat-canada-semi-finals-match-highlights-olympic-women-s\">the US scrapped a 4-3 win in the dying embers of extra-time</a>.</p> <p>There is usually a more jovial rivalry between the US and Canada, compared to other sporting rivalries across the planet, but not when it comes to women's soccer. Glancing at the comments after Monday's epic semi-final tie, you can see why both sets of players lunged into challenge after challenge on the greasy Old Trafford surface. Yes, there was a trip to the Olympic gold-medal match on the cards, but the ferocity ran deeper than that.</p> <p>A war of words ensued after the final whistle. Canada's coach, John Herdman, certainly didn't hold back.</p> <p>\"It was taken from us,\" he said. \"The referee will have to live with it. We'll<br>move on from this but I wonder if she will be able to.\"</p> <p>Herdman was talking about the decision to penalize Canada's keeper for holding the ball for longer than six seconds, which resulted in the USA's equalizing goal for 3-3.</p> <p>Canada's captain, Christine Sinclair, who scored a sublime hat-trick, also felt aggrieved.</p> <p>\"Obviously, we're disappointed and upset,\" she said. \"We felt that the referee took it away from us, so, yes, we are disappointed. We feel like we didn't lose, we feel like it was taken from us. It's a shame in a game like that, which is so important, that the ref decided the result before the game started.\"</p> <p>The debate will no doubt rumble on, <a href=\"http://www.insidemnsoccer.com/2012/08/08/xx-2/\">as Fifa has now waded in</a>. This shows just how the women's game has reverberated around the globe after these Olympics. Controversy aside, it is great for the women's game that a rivalry like this has been renewed. </p> <p>For the US this became a tournament of comebacks, and the showdown with Canada showcased their famous never-say-die attitude. To come back from, 1-0, 2-1 and 3-2 down takes some doing. And to find the resolve and composure to score the winner in injury-time in extra-time? That signifies remarkable resolve.</p> <h2>Morgan comes of age</h2> <p>Before the Olympics, coaches, players and opponents all pointed towards one US player who could make the difference at London 2012: Alex Morgan.</p> <p>Twelve months ago, at the World Cup in Germany, she was a bit-part player. Morgan came off the bench to devastating effect, scoring in the semi-final and final, but disappointment was in store for the California native as the US lost to Japan on penalties. When I met her in Glasgow on the eve of the Olympics, a burning desire surfaced in her eyes. She believed this was her time to shine.</p> <p>So what happened at the Olympics didn't surprise Morgan, or many<br>around her. She elevated herself from US prospect to international superstar in the space of two weeks.</p> <p>At 23, Morgan has it all. Pace, finesse, strength in the air and composure in front of goal. She catapulted the US to victory against France in the opener, before scoring the game-winning goal against Canada. Standing with her arms pointing towards the sky in the penalty box at Old Trafford, she signaled her rise to the top.</p> <p>Before the Games, Morgan responded coyly when responding to comments from her strike partner Wambach \u2013 who is arguably the greatest woman to ever play the game \u2013 to the effect that she was going to be the next global superstar.</p> <p>\"Abby is being a little too kind with her words,\" she said. \"She is all about the team. She is the best forward in the world. I really just look to her to learn a lot and follow in her footsteps.\"</p> <p>Those are some significant footsteps to follow. But after her performances and goals at the Olympics, Morgan is well on the way to taking over as the world's top striker.</p> <h2>The future?</h2> <p>The future is looking bright. With Morgan, Lauren Cheney, Heather O'Reilly, Sydney Leroux and Kelley O'Hara all under 25, US dominance looks set to continue. With the nation's fourth soccer Olympic gold around their necks, life couldn't get much better for Team USA. <a href=\"http://www.socceramerica.com/article/47689/plans-for-new-us-league-announced.html\">But it just did.</a></p> <p>Just before the Olympic final on Thursday, it was announced that a professional women's soccer league would be returning to the USA for<br>the 2013 season. Teams in Boston, Seattle, Florida and Chicago are committed for next spring, with others expected to join over the coming months. It will be the third time a pro league has been created in the US. Before the Olympic tournament <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/23/usa-olympic-team-soccer-uswnt-wpsl\">I spoke to the USA head coach, Pia Sundhage, about the importance a pro league in the US would have for women's soccer across the globe.</a></p> <p>Sundhage hoped the Olympics would help to create future leagues: \"Every big event, like the World Cup, the Olympics, is good for the women's game. And hopefully that makes it a little bit easier and a little bit more attractive to create more professional leagues in the world.\"</p> <p>The Swedish coach got her wish. So not only did the team's victory at London 2012 earn them a gold medal, it also reignited their dreams of playing professional soccer domestically.</p> <p>Without the Olympics, would the league have been reformed? Perhaps. But one thing's for certain, the USA's stellar performances and brand of exciting soccer certainly did it no harm. As did the performances of several other nations, as the league founders will hope to attract the top European and Asian players to the USA to play professionally.</p> <p>Women's soccer is on the rise and gaining respect across the world.<br>And after an invigorating tournament, they can count on Sir Bobby Charlton's support.</p> <p> \"I have had to remind myself that I am not watching the men,\" said the Manchester United and England great. \"I was skeptical of women's football \u2013 that was a mistake. Women's football used to be ridiculed, but not anymore.\"</p>",
  "<p>Who has won a medal at the London Olympics so far? We have collated what we hope is every medal winner so far - and mashed that data together with what we know about each athlete from our database of details here.</p> <p>There are just over 1,000 names on this list, many of them winners of more than one medal and some of them winners in more than one event.

  "<p>My day starts at one of the biggest schools in Ealing where, along with one of my colleagues, I'm giving a talk about drugs and alcohol in an assembly. As a young people's worker I spend a lot of my time out and about, getting to know my local community.</p> <p>Ealing is a very mixed area. There's a lot of deprivation, but there are wealthy areas too and I work with the whole spread. People often assume that in my job I only work with people from deprived backgrounds, but if there's one thing I've learnt it's that drug and alcohol misuse is an issue in every sector of society and can affect anybody. The key is to ensure young people get the appropriate help and support at the earliest opportunity before it becomes too problematic.</p> <p>After the assembly it's back to the office for some one-to-one meetings. At any one time I have about 15 young people on my books, and we meet regularly over several weeks to discuss where they are and where they want to be; we set targets for what they want to achieve both in the long and the short term. It's not necessarily just about abstinence \u2013 we do what works best for each individual.</p> <p>Officially I work with people between the ages of 10 and 18, but the majority are 15 or older; the youngest person who has needed our help was 12.</p> <p>While everyone is different, we do see trends in the types of substances people use. Young men are most likely to be using cannabis and young women tend to prefer alcohol. Thankfully, very few people at this age are using harder drugs \u2013 but without help, a problem with cannabis or alcohol can easily lead on to more serious, entrenched problems.</p> <p>Most of the people I work with are referred by their school. It may be that their education is being negatively affected or that their behaviour is a problem, or that they've been caught with something.</p> <p>Of course, what I do is very serious, but I do try to have a laugh and a joke too. In theory, our services are voluntary \u2013 unlike in some of our adult services, people haven't been arrested and told by a judge to seek help \u2013 but they can feel like they're under pressure to come and see us. It might be that they have been threatened with expulsion from school. Therefore, it's important that they see me as being different from their parents and teachers.</p> <p>Later, I grab some lunch on my way to a child protection meeting. Many of the people I work with are very vulnerable and have other problems that may have led them to misuse alcohol or drugs, so I spend a lot of time with social workers and other youth workers making sure that we look at every aspect of a young person's life.</p> <p>In the late afternoon, once schools have finished for the day, a colleague and I head to a youth group at one of the local estates. It's run by a separate youth support team but it's a useful environment for us to get to know the local community and chat with people in a more relaxed environment. We play some pool and they also put on classes in things like sound engineering. It does sometimes lead to people referring themselves to our services, as well as making us seem approachable.</p> <p>After work, I head to college: I'm training to be a qualified counsellor and I fit my classes in around work.</p> <p>My job is tiring but what makes it all worthwhile is catching up with one of the young people a couple of years later \u2013 whether that's because they've come to see me, or because I bump into them out in the community \u2013 and hearing about their successes. Maybe they're at college, maybe they're in a job, but most importantly they are happy and playing a positive role in their community. Just helping one person go down a positive course makes me feel like I've made a difference to society.</p> <p><em>The Ealing alcohol and substance youth project is run by </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/apr/17/leading-questions-david-royce-crime\" title=\"\"><em>national charity CRI</em></a></p> <p><em>If you know a role or someone who you would like to see featured in our 'A day in the life of...' series then get in touch by </em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>emailing us</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Another final, another Olympic boxing first: Luke Campbell (grandson of an Irish fighter), representing the recently rediscovered nation of Yorkshire, will contest the bantamweight gold medal against a bona fide Irishman, John Joe Nevin, of Mullingar, on Saturday.</p> <p>Campbell had too much ring nous and movement for Japan's Satoshi Shimizu in the first semi-final on Friday and won going away, 20-11.</p> <p>Nevin had a slightly trickier time of it against the Cuban L\u00e1zaro Alvarez, who was striving to maintain his country's remarkable run of at the weight, but the Irishman was worth the 19-14 score.</p> <p>\"I said at the beginning that it would be great to have me and Nevin in the final and here we are,\" Campbell said. \"I've got Irish family and they know his family \u2013 simple as that.\"</p> <p>Nevin would not be drawn on a prediction, but said: \"I always said I am up there with the best of the world. I am getting better as I go along.\"</p> <p>There is a golden glow about both squads at the business end of the tournament, and the Hibernian diaspora can be expected to contribute again to an ear-splitting occasion at the ExCeL. It should be every bit as intense and loud as Katie Taylor's quarter-final win over Natasha Jonas, when the decibel count hit an ear-aching 113.7dB.</p> <p>\"I can't believe it,\" Campbell said. \"It is everything I have ever dreamed of. It is the best high you can feel ever because you have worked hard for it. There is definitely more to come from me. That's been the case for me in this tournament. They are different styles you are being confronted with and you have got to adapt. I don't want to give anything away before tomorrow. He has got an awkward style \u2013 and so have I.\"</p> <p>The first 30 seconds, according to research by the Great Britain squad, are crucial in any amateur bout \u2013 knowledge that Campbell took to heart with a lively start against a long-armed opponent reinstated in the competition after mysteriously not getting the initial verdict against the Azerbaijan fighter Magomed Abdulhamidov, who touched down five times and had to be helped to the dressing room.</p> <p>Campbell, moving smoothly, gave the Japanese no such easy hitting space until the final moments of round one, and did enough to take it 5-2.</p> <p>In the second, the Hull southpaw kept his shape and discipline, his overhand right hurting Shimizu several times. There was little of quality coming the other way from the slow-fisted Japanese, who seem content to walk into Campbell's jab as if it were his friend. It wasn't.</p> <p>Campbell led 11-6 going into the final three minutes, his only mark a bloody nose from an uppercut. Shimizu, a decent punch-thrower, started strongly but his defence was poor and wobbled in front of Cambpell's more educated attacks in a storming finish.</p> <p>In the first semi-final, Nevin was in with an opponent of unusual gangliness for a Cuban, feet spread and torso twisting, a veritable southpaw octopus of a target, but the Irishman showed admirable patience.</p> <p>He speared a lead right through Alvarez's wide guard several times in round one, and the Irish fans, who seem to have taken over this venue, roared their approval of the 5-3 score after three minutes.</p> <p>Nevin took more risks in round two, and profited from his daring to extend his lead to 12-9, but the Cuban was warming to the job.</p> <p>Boxing with his hands down, Nevin let his feet be his protectors in a dancing third, scoring with long rights to the body, left hooks and a stiff jab, as his opponent tired. He had the quicker hands and brain, showboating with some fancy footwork near the end (what Nevin calls \"the Mullingar Shuffle\"), and looked well-pleased at the end, winning 19-14. It was a superb performance, one that the Great Britain strategists will have analysed deeply.</p> <p>Earlier, there was heartbreak for the second Olympics in a row for Nevin's compatriot Paddy Barnes at light-flyweight. In Beijing, the Chinese favourite Shiming Zou beat him 15-0 in the semi-final, and the Irishman joked this week that his aim in facing the same opponent at the same stage here was to \"score a point\". He did that on Friday \u2013 adding another 14 to match the tally of his exquisitely talented opponent, only to lose on a countback.</p> <p>It was desperately close, and difficult to score, testimony to the commitment of both boxers, but Barnes had to settle for bronze.</p> <p>\"I thought I had it,\" he said later, \"because I threw more punches than him. I had a slow start in the first round and that's what did it. I felt total and utter devastation [on hearing the result].\"</p>",
  "<p>It will put some in mind of constellations forming and reforming. Others will think of sea creatures unspooling across the inky ocean floor, or of strings of delicate fairy lights shivering in the breeze. A higher than usual percentage of late-night Edinburgh revellers \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/aug/11/edinburgh-festival-dusk-till-dawn\" title=\"\">5am closing times</a> are permitted during the festival \u2013 will presumably wonder what exactly is dancing before their eyes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/audioslideshow/2012/aug/09/speed-of-light-edinburgh-festival\" title=\"\">Speed of Light</a>, a major new art project that marks this weekend's opening of the Edinburgh international festival, defies categorisation: a vast community-created spectacle that crossbreeds high-tech digital light show with ancient land art, robotic choreography with eerie sound installation. Appropriately enough for an event designed to coincide with the closing weekend of the Olympics 400 miles south in London, it also has more than a hint of endurance athletics.</p> <p>Employing some 4,000 volunteer digital-light-wearing runners and walkers, for 20 nights Speed of Light is occupying one of the most dramatic spaces in this most dramatic of cityscapes: <a href=\"http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/arthurseat/geology/geology.html\" title=\"\">Arthur's Seat</a>, the craggy extinct volcano that lours over Edinburgh's graceful classical buildings like a reminder of a more primitive and brutal age.</p> <p>Although fragments of the show can be glimpsed from the city down below, reportedly from as far as three miles away on a clear night, the best views are reserved for those who ascend the peak on one of the nightly guided walking tours \u2013 a minor feat of endurance itself, given that Arthur's Seat is 250 metres above sea level.</p> <p>Yet the challenge of being in the audience pales alongside that being taken on by the runners, according to the project's creative director, Angus Farquhar. He said: \"There are 29 run leaders leading the groups each night, running 50-odd miles, ascending a total of 35,000ft over the 20 nights of the project, the equivalent of going higher than Everest.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It's public art in the truest sense. The work is made by everyone who takes part.\"</p> <p>Farquhar has dreamed of doing a project like this for the past 25 years, but only recently perfected the technology \u2013 and found the six-figure sum \u2013 required to make it reality. Each of the runners wears a specially constructed suit studded with lights, each of which is controlled remotely. Sometimes they flash green, or red; sometimes they appear multicoloured, or throb pure white, like electricity pulsing along a cable. Their bodies dappled with these chameleonic patterns, the runners are choreographed to follow a range of moves on the dark hillside \u2013 spinning slowly around in wobbly ellipses, clustering tightly in nodes, racing together to a single point then emitting outwards like a burst of energy into black space.</p> <p>\"The timing requirements are meticulous,\" said Farquhar. \"Our choreographer <a href=\"http://litzabixler.com/\" title=\"\">Litza Bixler</a>, who works in Hollywood, said it's the hardest job she's done.\"</p> <p>The one thing that cannot be rehearsed, naturally, is the Scottish weather: although final rehearsals have taken place in ideal conditions, the runners ascending in dusky light against coral-coloured, tranquil skies, much of the previous training has taken place in this summer's sheeting rain. More challenging still is Edinburgh's notorious <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/scotland/edinburgh/weather\" title=\"\">haar</a>, the easterly fog that races in from the Firth and blankets the city like soggy cotton wool.</p> <p>But the international festival's artistic director, Jonathan Mills, insisted that the work's responsiveness to the environment was very much the point: \"You'll experience something no matter what the weather conditions are. In fog the sound appears at a lower altitude. Even in extreme weather conditions you'll still see the light.\"</p> <p>Speed of Light is a risk, and not just for those taking part \u2013 never before has the festival done community-led art on this scale. During the six years of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/03/australia.theatre\" title=\"\">Mills's stewardship</a> it has attempted to loosen its strait-laced and somewhat starchy reputation. Two years ago the theme was <a href=\"http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/new-world-theme-edinburgh-international-festival-2010\" title=\"\">the New World</a> ; last year, Asia loomed large. This year's festival is experimenting with something its anarchic, sometimes delinquent offspring, the fringe festival, does as a matter of course: popping up where audiences least expect.</p> <p>\"A festival is nothing but a pop-up, in a way,\" said Mills. \"But we're trying to do it on a large scale with some of the finest, most important and innovative artists in the world. We're constantly asking ourselves what the festival can be, who it's for.\"</p> <p>Also new is the decision to spend nearly half a million pounds constructing <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18927634\" title=\"\">three temporary, custom-made theatre spaces</a> in an exhibition hall at Ingliston, next to Edinburgh airport. Festival audiences will be bussed out for three spectacular, immersive shows \u2013 one of which, performed by the much-garlanded French troupe Theatre du Soleil, is a genuine coup for Mills. The company's director, Ariane Mnouchkine, is regularly described as one of the world's leading theatre directors; despite travelling widely elsewhere, this is their first time in the UK for 20 years.</p> <p>Another Ingliston production, a cinematic-scale version of <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/macbeth\" title=\"\">Macbeth by the young Polish company TR Warszawa</a>, will be live-streamed on the Guardian website on Monday \u2013 also a first. Other highlights include the arrival of the renowned Japanese director Tadashi Suzuki and a three-part visit by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/apr/18/angelin-preljocaj-interview\" title=\"\">groundbreaking French company</a> Ballet Preljocaj.</p> <p>At the final rehearsals for Speed of Light, though, Farquhar's runners were simply concentrating on where exactly they were planting their feet on the treacherous hillside. Emma Davidson, 36, a who is running later in the week, was upbeat: \"It'll look absolutely amazing, I think.

  "<p>OK, first things first - let's congratulate Sporting KC for winning the US Open Cup on Wednesday night ensuring a) that Seattle Sounders wouldn't win a record fourth successive trophy and b) that I didn't spend the evening squinting from the press box at indistinct AC Milan and Real Madrid players knocking the ball around somewhere in the distance at Yankee Stadium, but instead <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">spent it on a chair giving updates on the weather just outside Kansas City</a>.

And speaking of regrouping, <strong>New York</strong> must try pick themselves up after their defeat at <strong>Houston</strong> last Friday night, to defend their unbeaten home record against the same opponents<em>this</em> Friday night. </p> <p>Normally a rivalry game between <strong>Columbus </strong>and <strong>Toronto</strong> would be guaranteed to come with some edge, but the game has been entirely overshadowed by the untimely death of Columbus midfielder Kirk Urso last week.

In the meantime, join me for this weekend's live game, <strong>San Jose vs Seattle</strong>, and/or follow me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil</a> for updates on that and other matters of grave import. </p> <p><em>All game times listed are EST</em></p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Houston Dynamo, Fri 8pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p> <p>The Red Bulls had a chance last Friday to really establish a foothold atop the Eastern Conference if they could take three points from Houston Dynamo. Unfortunately, Hans Backe's men came out and delivered one of the most lackluster performances from any team this season. There was minimal creativity despite the addition of Tim Cahill to the lineup, and for the most part the Red Bulls seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else than in Texas that night. </p> <p>So on that Friday night, the Red Bulls surrendered the Eastern Conference lead to Houston, and must now settle for playing Houston for the Eastern Conference lead on Friday night. MLS scheduling logic, ladies and gentlemen! This time the Red Bulls are at home, where they, just like Houston, are undefeated on the season. Tim Cahill should be good for about 60 minutes in his proper home debut, but he and the rest of the proper attacking forces - Thierry Henry, Kenny Cooper and Sebastien Le Toux - will have to show they have the desire to play and win. A second consecutive loss against Houston, and New York can kiss almost any hope of a number one seed goodbye, and will instead be staring at an increasingly tight middle of the table. </p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Nothing rhymes with orange...except WINNING. Not only did the Dynamo get to fire off El Capitan (the replica 18th century mountain howitzer cannon awarded to the winner of the season series between Houston and FC Dallas), they whooped the New York Red Bulls to take over first place in the Eastern Conference. Now, I know it's only August but the Dynamo are playing some stout soccer right now and there's no reason to believe that's going to change. The 4-3-3 formation is working to perfection and thanks to Jermaine Taylor being a genuine bad ***, the loss of Geoff Cameron is not causing the defense any problems.</p> <p>A second straight match with the Red Bulls, this time in New York...don't you just love MLS scheduling? This won't be easy, in fact it wouldn't surprise if the Red Bulls are able to get some revenge, especially with Dax McCarty back from suspension. Still, the Dynamo are playing great and I don't think there's any team that scares them at the moment, at least in the East. It should be a great game and I really think the Dynamo can get another win. Maybe I'm being greedy, but it's hard not to be confident about this team at the moment. That said, a draw would be perfectly fine with me. </p> <h2>Vancouver Whitecaps vs Real Salt Lake, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>The Whitecaps have had an extended break, which is probably good for the team, as they have to assimilate a few new players. Scottish internationals Barry Robson and Kenny Miller were excused from international duty so they could settle in with the team, and new defender Andy O'Brien and Brazilian midfielder Tiago Ulisses should get some time to train with the team, though don't look for either to start a game soon.&#xa0;</p> <p>Our last game was a tough 2-1 defeat to Real Salt Lake in Utah. The team played well, with Darren Mattocks impressing again and Robson showing his quality in the middle of the park again. We could have left Utah with something, but a couple of defensive mistakes gifted Real Salt Lake the victory. </p> <p>Saturday's game is a re-match against Real Salt Lake, a game we need to get something from if we're going to stay firmly in a play-off spot. We saw last game that we can compete with and even outplay the Western powerhouse team, especially in the middle of the park, so we'll head into the game hoping for a win. Our home form is stellar, our players are fit and rested, and Rennie has some depth on the bench if he needs it. Look for Bonjour and DeMerit to redeem themselves. Our entire team needs to play a solid 90 minutes, and we'll need something special (again) from our strike force. Maybe Miller to get his first goal in a Whitecaps shirt?&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslsoapbox.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>For Real Salt Lake there are 10 matches left in the MLS regular season. Their last 10 matches didn't show well with just a 4-5-1 record and that has a lot of people asking questions about how good this RSL side might be. &#xa0;Are they too old? Are they too comfortable as a team? Are they too slow? Too narrow? And all of those are valid questions for a team that has struggled for the last two months. Coming off their 1-0 loss at Colorado last weekend, RSL now has to head north of the border to take on the Vancouver Whitecaps, a team that they faced just a couple weeks ago at Rio Tinto Stadium. In that match RSL picked up a hard fought 2-1 win.</p> <p>That match ended with Joe Cannon being given a straight red card for handling the ball outside of the area, and since Vancouver has had the last two weeks off they should be well rested and ready to go without their number one keeper. For RSL it has been thousands of miles of travel to Costa Rica and then Colorado, now they have to try to find a way to beat a Whitecaps side that has only lost once at home this year and they have to do it without Jamison Olave, who is out with an injury. Mission Impossible? Nope, but it sure isn't going to be easy. RSL must find a way to force Vancouver to make mistakes and then capitalize on them, and that is easier said than done. I am picking a 2-2 draw in this one.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew vs Toronto FC, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>With the tragic, sudden, and still unexplained death of 22 year old rookie midfielder Kirk Urso Sunday morning, it may seem inappropriate to fret over and analyze something as seemingly meaningless as a game. There was even talk of postponing this weekend's match, but Coach Warzycha decided that Urso would \"want us to go on the field and win the game and play as hard as he did.\" As condolences and remembrances continue to funnel in, there is one common thread: Urso loved soccer. There can be few better ways to honor him than to pour ourselves into our own Saturday routines with all the dedication he showed, but now, with a much greater appreciation for how special each weekend is that we get to spend watching the sport we love with the people we love.</p> <p>Last week it was the same old Crew: agonizingly pitiful offense, Gruenebaum with more outstanding goalkeeping, good defense with one small mistake that leads to an unlucky goal (credit to D.C.'s Pontius, however, he has shown a great knack for goal this season), and the Crew drops another close one. </p> <p>This week sees old foe Toronto return to Columbus. The Crew won early this season 1-0 in Toronto. But, this isn't the same TFC team that lost its first nine games of the season. With a new coach and lots of new faces on the pitch, Toronto is much improved, but they're still struggling to play well in successive games. The Crew have also been inconsistent, which makes this game hard to call. The real question will probably be if heavy hearts make for heavy feet and clouded minds, or if tragedy will inspire victory? This week, I just have to believe in these guys. 2-1 for Kirk's friends in black and gold.</p> <p><strong>Duncan Fletcher</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wakingthered.com/\">Waking the Red</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>Last week saw Toronto FC go into Chicago on the back of a 5-1 Concacaf Champions league win, and with new signing Eric Hassli making his debut up front. What happened was a bit of a let down. Hassli showed his class for sure, but didn't really touch the ball much as it was all Chicago, all the time. TFC actually took the lead when Ryan Johnson, capitalising on a misplaced backpass from Marco Pappa, scored while simultaneously slipping over. It was 1-0 at half time, but Chicago came back and after Logan Emory was sent off, and with Jeremy Hall off injured, Chicago added the insult by scoring the winner against the 9 men. It finished 2-1, a thoroughly deserved loss for TFC, very much killing off the faint playoff hopes that sprang from their earlier 3 game win streak.</p> <p>This week it's to Columbus, and as well as hopefully getting 90 minutes from Hassli, they'll (fitness permitting) be reinforced at the back by new signing Darren O'Dea, formerly of Celtic and most recently Leeds United. Given the Kirk Urso news, this should be a very emotional game, and how the Crew react could decide it really. Will they be motivated to win one for Kirk? Probably - in which case they'll have too much for TFC. Crew win 2-1. </p> <h2>Sporting Kansas City vs D.C. United, Sat 8.30pm </h2> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Coming off the buzz from its US Open Cup win \u2013 and ending an eight year run without a trophy \u2013 Sporting KC will be one of two things in its upcoming match against DC United: fatigued or inspired. Sporting KC got the win after 129 minutes of play, but did not come away injury-free. Left back Seth Sinovic was assisted off the pitch due to what looked to be an ankle injury. This creates some instability for the SKC back line, with Collin out of play the last couple of matches and Chance Myers (who played all 129 minutes on Wednesday) just returning from injury. Even if the starting defenders hit the pitch Saturday, there is still the need for Vermes to be cautious. DC United's De Rosario will be a definite threat.</p> <p>In the midfield, Graham Zusi has looked unfocused and Roger Espinoza is back from the Olympics and looking good despite having virtually no rest. His compatriot at DC United, winger Andy Najar, has rested and could prove difficult for Sporting KC. On the upside, forward Teal Bunbury seems to be finding his form lately. With Bunbury, CJ Sapong and Kei Kamara up, there is a lot of opportunity for Sporting to score some goals. Sporting KC has won its past two matches against DC United and has kept four clean sheets in its past six matches in League competition. DC United has struggled to score on the road, but Sporting KC has struggled to score at home. This may be an evenly fought match for these two, but a necessary win for Sporting KC to keep its place at the top of the table. </p> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.blackandredunited.com/\">Black and Red United</a>, DC:</p> <p>Saturday's 1-0 win over the Columbus Crew wasn't exactly a resounding one for D.C. United, but it was a win nonetheless. Following two road losses and an unbalanced schedule that gave United lots of time to wallow in their temporary slump, getting back on track was critical at RFK Stadium. United dominated possession for much of the match and had far better chances, but could only finish one of them. Chris Pontius got his 10th goal of the season in finishing off a great run from rookie Nick DeLeon to put D.C. on top. The return of Argentine center back Emiliano Dudar helped solidify the shutout for the home team.</p> <p>This weekend's match won't quite be as simple as United pays a visit to Sporting Kansas City for a big battle between talented teams that could determine playoff position in the Eastern Conference. The Sporks just played in the U.S. Open Cup Final on Wednesday night, so United may be catching them at a good time. Look for Pontius and Dwayne De Rosario to attack their tired legs endlessly and without regret.</p> <h2>FC Dallas vs Colorado Rapids, Sat 9pm</h2> <p><strong>Parrish Glover</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>The feud between Brek Shea and Schellas Hyndman has come to an apparent end, with the young star returning to the starting lineup for this past weekend's game against Portland. The return paid dividends as well, with Shea setting up Scott Sealy for a 51st minute goal. Unfortunately, the Hoops also welcomed the return of the red card to our squad as well. Zach Loyd and Franck Songo'o had been locked in a fierce battle all game long, with Loyd picked up a second yellow card not long after the goal. The Dallas defense fought valiantly, but gave up an equalizer in the late stages. Two more squandered points in a season full of wasted opportunity.</p> <p>This weekend, we welcome the return of the Colorado Rapids to Frisco, Texas. The Rapids are the side that hosted the come-from-behind victory that snapped our three-month winless streak last month, and we relish the opportunity to rack up more points against the struggling Rapids. Loyd's red card suspension will mean more that the attack will need to compensate for a weakened back line. Fortunately, David Ferreira has quickly returned to his 2010 form captaining the midfield. He and Shea looked strong working together in Portland and supporters are hoping to see more of their collaboration on Saturday night.</p> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, COO, <a href=\"http://www.bulldogsupporters.com\">Bulldog Supporters Group</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>Last week the Rapids stopped the rot with a hard fought 1-0 win against Real Salt Lake, their first in 9 attempts. Rapids fans have to cast their minds back to May 2009 to recall the last win against their Rocky Mountain Cup rivals. The team played with the heart &amp; soul that fans love to see &amp; there really was no better team to bring the losing streak to an end. Because the victory was against RSL, it's almost as if it's worth 2 or 3 against other teams. They say the game is built on hope &amp; there is plenty of that around Denver at the moment; hope that the bad times are past, hope that we may just still be able to make a run for the play-offs.</p> <p>This weekend the Rapids have the task of travelling to hot &amp; dry Texas to face an FC Dallas team that they know they can beat. MLS Cup 2010 references aside, two sendings off for Dallas in the first away game back in May allowed the Rapids to come away with a 2-0 away although at a cost of a nasty ankle injury to Omar Cummings. Omar is back however Conor Casey is a concern having missed training today, presumably due to the same hamstring problem that's kept him out for the last few weeks. We should go for the win, however a draw would keep the feelings of hope alive for us.</p> <h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs Seattle Sounders, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>GUARDIAN LIVE GAME</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Before facing the Chicago Fire a fortnight ago, Steven Lenhart Wig Night led to a degree of levity for the pre-game team lineup picture and a surreal Harpo Marx ambiance in the stadium. Spectacular saves throughout the game by Chicago goalkeeper Sean Johnson, continually defied the determined efforts of the Earthquakes offense. With extra-time running out after 98 minutes (yes, 98), Lenny pounced on the ball for the latest of late equalizers - the newly hirsute crowd wigged out, and it was blonde-haired bedlam at Buck Shaw. Shea Salinas donned a fan's fake curls leaving the referee stuttering in his wake, uncertain as to whether his celebration was a bookable offence. <br> The more restrained friendly against Swansea City FC ended in another tie: 2-2, and was our first opportunity to see Mehdi Ballouchy, the curly haired midfielder recently acquired from NYRB - a Ballouchy Wig Night is surely on the cards. After a bye in Week 22, the Earthquakes remain at home for this weekend's match up with Seattle. Despite the cup loss, Seattle are not in Kansas anymore and are coming off a 4-0 romp over the LA Galaxy in MLS play, and will present a tough challenge for the Quakes to keep their home streak alive. The Earthquakes squad are rested, Ballouchy is up to speed, and the synthetic Seattle bounce is absent from the lush green grass of Buck Shaw \u2013 I believe the Quakes will remain unbeaten at home. </p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>What a week for Sounders FC. To have such high emotional confidence following a 4-0 destruction of the Los Angeles Galaxy in front of close to 61,000, to a belly blow of losing the US Open Cup final in penalties. We saw a tale of two teams. The first MLS match, a managing clinic by Schmid, made for a deflated Galaxy squad left with no answers and nothing but excuses post match. It was amazing. You couldn't ask for a better way to go into a cup final than Sunday night's contest at the Clink. </p> <p>Then Sporting Kansas City happened. A team that always seems to bring out the worst play in our squad, reminiscent of the Houston Dynamo teams of the latter part of the previous decade. Ugly physical brutish soccer that results in bodies flying everywhere and tempers lost. At the end of the day, the Sounders can place the blame on referee Ricardo Salazar all they want, <a href=\"http://imgur.com/iLwbm\">maybe justifiably</a>, but missing 3 penalty kicks in a row does not win you hardware.</p> <p>This Saturday's match against the San Jose Earthquakes will mark the 3rd game in 6 days, the latter two being on the road. It will be asking a lot to think the Sounders can come away with 3 points after the 210 minutes played within a 4 day period, so to come away with a point on the road would be acceptable. However this was a team built to be competitive on multiple fronts, so hopefully we'll see a little more of the newly acquired players, Christian Tiffert and Mario Martinez. How will the team will respond to Wednesday night's final? This Saturday will put this year's team character on full display.</p> <h2>New England Revolution vs Montreal Impact, Sun 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>:</p> <p>Another week, another frustrating result with more frustrating play.&#xa0;I thought given the results of the past couple weeks, plus being at home, that the Revs were going to come out a blazing, and instead they looked frustrated.&#xa0;Maybe the emotional toll of trading Shalrie was too much for the team this week?&#xa0;Shalrie hadn't played the past few games, so they shouldn't have been missing his presence on the field, so it is possible he had much bigger impact off the field than the team realized.</p> <p>There were moments in the game that I couldn't understand why they weren't passing the ball to players that were clearly open, instead they were trying to dribble the ball into the goal.&#xa0;I got the feeling that the trust level among the players is at a new low - or everyone wanted to be the hero.&#xa0;Since there is so little positive about this game, I look forward to Sunday against Montreal - news from the front office is that our newest DP Jerry Bengtson will be back from the Olympics to play.&#xa0;His Olympic play was a confusing thing to cheer for - on one hand you want to see him do well (and he did) on the other you want him back on the field playing well for the Revs. </p> <p>Trading Shalrie, dumping the much touted number 9 Moreno, and Bengtson's play at the Olympics - in summary there was more interesting things happening off the field then on the field versus KC.&#xa0;Against Montreal, I think they will figure it out as long as Bengtson plays. 2-1 Revs.</p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>The Montreal Impact repeated an important feat for the second time in its MLS season: back-to-back MLS wins. The momentum from the win vs the New York Red Bulls followed the team, as the Impact took on the Philadelphia Union. The new ''3-5-2'' for Montreal saw Nesta, Rivas and Ferrari line up against a young, dynamic Union team. With Marco Di Vaio absent, Andrew Wenger took over and scored off a corner-kick before the end of the first half. The game as a whole was not the most exciting but the Impact took care of business. Felipe scored on a scissor kick to seal the deal, probably one of the top goals I have seen in MLS this season.</p> <p>This Sunday, the Impact take on another patriotic-themed team, the New England Revolution. 5 points behind the Chicago Fire, Montreal cannot afford not-to-win even if the game is away at Gillette Stadium. The Revolution is another young team but has stronger offensive assets than the Union. Last time both teams played, the Impact took a win at home but it was not easy, with Nguyen and Sene always dangerous in different situations.</p> <p>It will be an interesting test for newly-acquired (goalkeeper swap with the Timbers) Troy Perkins who should face the Revolution on Sunday.</p> <h2>Philadelphia Union vs Chicago Fire, 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Scott Kessler</strong>, Managing Editor, <a href=\"http://www.brotherlygame.com\">The Brotherly Game</a>, Philadelphia:</p> <p>Saturday was a disappoint for the Philadelphia Union, to say the least. After flying high for most of John Hackworth's time as interim head coach, the Union came crashing down against the Montreal Impact. A poor performance sent Philadelphia home with a 2-0 loss and an even harder time attempting to force itself back into the playoff race. There was little to take away from the game for the Union, leaving them with only a chance at redemption against the Chicago Fire, on Sunday, as a way to forget about the defeat.</p> <p>The main story line heading into Saturday has revolved around Bakary Soumare. The tall center back holds the potential to drastically change the Union's entire season, but questions have been posed as to whether or not he's ready to play after knee surgery in March. If Soumare does play on Sunday, his debut would come against his former team, the Fire, and most likely come in place of captain Carlos Valdes, who may be traveling to join up with the Colombian national team.</p> <p>If Valdes is away, Soumare's inclusion in the starting lineup would provide Philadelphia with its strongest option, given that Porfirio Lopez or Chris Albright remain the only backups at center back otherwise.</p> <p>Prediction: 1-1. A goal from Josue Martinez, given the start in place of McInerney, who was suspended for his reaction to Nelson Rivas' headbutt of Antoine Hoppenot, brings the Union even, and neither team can do much else.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Piggott</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/\">Hot Time in Old Town</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeybrothers05\">Whiskey Brothers Aught Five</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>Seconds after Marco Pappa's errant back pass, the Fire went down 1 nil at home last week to Toronto. If that happened last year, heads would've dropped and confidence levels plummeted. But this is 2012 and Chicago Fire is a completely different animal. Even though they were trailing 1-0 at halftime, I knew they would come back and win - the players did too; turning it around courtesy of a brilliant header by rookie-of-the-year candidate Austin Berry late in the match. Fernandez had a great, though injury-shortened, debut and Frank Klopas also showed his coaching maturity, taking off the lackluster Oduro at halftime and replacing him with DP Sherjill MacDonald, who had an excellent second half. Nyarko also came in for the injured Fernandez and continued his brilliant form.</p> <p>Philly poses a somewhat different threat for the Fire this Sunday. I expect a very similar lineup to the one against TFC with the only change perhaps being up top, where MacDonald is much better suited to holding the ball up than Oduro. Philly may give a debut to former Fire defender Bakary Soumare which would be a bold move considering that Philly's center back pairing of Okugo and Valdes have played well recently and Soumare hasn't played a first team game in several months. His inclusion could be a positive for the Fire who could exploit the potential new center back partnership. Freddy Adu has had a quiet few games for Philly and the Fire will look to continue that trend Sunday night. The team is on a good run and picking up three away points should be the goal. 2-1 Fire with goals from MacDonald and Rolfe.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs LA Galaxy, Sun 11pm (ESPN2, ESPND)</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Last week, Chivas USA were on a bye, which was a little unfortunate as they were coming off a 1-0 win the previous week against the Portland Timbers in Portland. That victory resulted in a season sweep of the Timbers, which is a nice accomplishment, but Chivas have considerable work to do over the rest of the season if they want to make the playoffs in 2012. One factor that may help is the arrival of midfielder Shalrie Joseph, who was traded from the New England Revolution last week. Considering the weaknesses in midfield and the problems the team has had in providing quality service to the attackers, it is hoped that Joseph can provide an instant upgrade.</p> <p>The Goats return to action Sunday against the LA Galaxy in the third edition of the 2012 SuperClasico. Each team has taken a game in the series this season, and Los Angeles bragging rights are on the line. In addition, the match has larger implications, as Chivas are chasing the Galaxy for the final playoff spot. As a result, this is one of those proverbial \"six-pointers\" that could prove crucial to Chivas' playoff hopes at this stage of the season. If they can play Sunday with a stout defense and some attacking creativity, they have a good chance to win the game.</p> <p><strong>Josie Becker</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.lagconfidential.com\">LAG Confidential</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>Last week was atrocious for the Galaxy, which is a shame because their form in July was excellent. Defending became an afterthought as the Seattle Sounders seemed able to score at will. Looking back, it's sort of amazing that a back line featuring a rookie, a player still rehabbing from injury, and a player who isn't very good, took this long to have just an absolute stinker. Still, the Galaxy as of late have at least been able to score goals over their stinkers. LA never looked threatening, never recovered from giving up a goal in the first five minutes. </p> <p>Now this week the Galaxy face the rubber match of this year's SuperClasico series. LA last played Chivas three times in a season back in 2009, when teams played a double round robin and then two extra matches against two regional rivals. Chivas went goalless in three that year - so far this year they've managed one goal from a penalty. With Chivas scoring only 14 goals thus far this year, the story is simple. Either the Galaxy score goals and win, or don't and lose. The possibility for an all out shoot out from these two clubs is minuscule. </p> <p>It's unlikely the Galaxy DP trio has it in them to contribute as little as they did in Seattle for a second straight week.</p>",

  "<p>After thrilling cycling performances from Sir Chris Hoy, Laura Trott, Victoria Pendleton and Bradley Wiggins, what kind of two-wheeled bounce can we expect from the Olympics? Doubtless there will be more cash for the elite end of the sport and perhaps more support for cycling clubs. But is there already something interesting and positive happening for ordinary cyclists around the country?</p> <p>A couple of comments on a Guardian blog suggest perhaps that there is (ht <a href=\"http://twitter.com/severincarrell\" title=\"\">@severincarrell</a>).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17577169\" title=\"\">Streetlamp writes</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"I live near Glasgow and travel into it regularly by bike as well as riding on busy urban roads to my work in Paisley every day. I think that the cycling tracks in the west of Scotland range from good to unusable but are improving. Interestingly, I was talking to a couple of other cyclists at work today and I mentioned that I thought that the car drivers had been much more tolerant during the last two weeks. One of the guys, a club cyclist who does lots of road miles, agreed. We wondered if it might be a knock-on effect from the Olympics. Could it be that the heroics of the UK cycling team have made car drivers more sympathetic towards us? Have any other cyclists noticed this effect or am I imagining it?\" </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17578405\" title=\"\">in response, m0nty says</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"I think I've noticed this: I just don't want to be too optimistic! In truth I think most motorists are pretty good anyway, but the last week or so seems better. Also, driving home from the shops tonight, there were dozens of cyclists around, on routes which (when I cycle them) seem mostly deserted. I would love this to be a cycling renaissance in Britain, but don't want to get my hopes up. Maybe we should compare notes again in the spring, and see how many of these Olympics-inspired cyclists (if that's what they are) are still doing it after some cold, dark winter evenings?\" </blockquote> <p>Have you noticed a difference?

  "<p>Output from Britain's construction industry fell by almost 4% in the second quarter of 2012 and has dropped by almost a tenth in the past year, according to official figures.</p> <p>A moribund housing market and a big fall in public infrastructure work meant activity in the sector declined to levels last seen at the depths of the 2008-09 recession. The performance in the three months to June, however, was not as bad as the Office for National Statistics had feared when estimating the latest growth figures.</p> <p>The ONS had factored in a 5.2% fall in construction output <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/25/george-osborne-under-pressure-economy\" title=\"\">when it announced last month a 0.7% drop in gross domestic product</a>, extending the UK's double-dip recession into a third quarter.</p> <p>But on Friday it said the decline was 3.9%, raising hopes that the second quarter GDP figure will be revised upwards later this month.</p> <p>City analysts said the new data for construction would be enough to add 0.1 percentage points to growth, and followed data for manufacturing earlier this week that was also less poor than the ONS had anticipated.</p> <p>Howard Archer, UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said : \"The current indications are that GDP may 'only' have contracted by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. And the hope is that if the hit to both industrial production and construction activity from the extra day's public holiday in the second quarter was overestimated by the ONS, there may also be an upward revision to services activity, which was reported to have contracted by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter.\"</p> <p>The ONS said output from public infrastructure projects was down 8.6% between the first and second quarters of 2012 and was down almost 25% on the second quarter of 2011, when work on the London Olympics was under way. Construction industry figures said the outlook for the sector was poor.</p> <p>Steve McGuckin, managing director of the construction and programme management consultancy Turner &amp; Townsend, said: \"All the sunshine and Olympic feelgood factor in the world can't hide the fact that these are black days for the construction sector. Stagnation has moved from the stuff of nightmares to the new norm. The big drop in infrastructure output is of particular concern for the economy as a whole.\"</p>",
  "<p>Recent calculations of the economic value of nature and ecosystem services have caused many environmentalists to react negatively. They point to the risk of a progressive \"privatisation\" and \"commodification\" of nature, and argue that society should appreciate the intrinsic values of nature \u2013 nature for its own sake. Putting a 'price on nature' will create more enclosures whereby the public benefits derived from ecosystems will be seized by corporations and other private interests.</p> <p>The new discourse about \"natural capital\" is seen by some as another step towards the degradation of the biosphere. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/06/price-rivers-rain-greatest-privatisation\" title=\"\">George Monbiot wrote is such terms this week</a>. He argued:</p> <blockquote> Rarely will the money to be made by protecting nature match the money to be made by destroying it. Nature offers low rates of return by comparison to other investments. If we allow the discussion to shift from values to value \u2013 from love to greed \u2013 we cede the natural world to the forces wrecking it. <br> </blockquote> <p>But to paint such a one-sided picture is a dangerous game. For decades campaigners have fought for the protection of nature for its own sake, and while there has been notable progress (seen for example in the rapid increase in protected areas worldwide, which will hopefully continue irrespective of purely economic evaluations), the overall trends have not been encouraging.</p> <p>The destruction of unprotected forests, loss of soils, depletion of aquifers, extinction of animals and plants and plunder of the oceans has continued apace. It seems that the moral argument has gained insufficient traction, and that in the absence of new frames continuing population and economic growth will cause more damage.</p> <p>One source of hope comes from the growing realisation that nature is essential for economic development. The message is clear: without nature the economy is nothing. That penny is beginning to drop in various important places, and could soon lead to a new era of policy-making. One in which ecology and economics go hand in hand, but only if we have the tools to build bridges between these worlds that are so alien to each other. And that is where the economic valuation of nature can come in.</p> <p>By appreciating that nature is vital for economics, and has measurable tangible financial values, it is possible to get the attention of people who have at best hitherto regarded nature a supplier of resources, or worse still an economically costly distraction that gets in the way of economic 'growth'. Making the moral case in the face of such beliefs won't work. If, on the other hand, such scepticism can be met with economically compelling logic, then we might get a bit further.</p> <p>There are of course ecological values (like beauty and the very fact that things exist) that sometimes cannot be assigned financial values, and should be protected by the law, policy and public backing rather than through markets.</p> <p>There are certainly dangers that come with financial values being attached to natural systems. These might be seen in how countries choose to reflect the value of ecosystems (like forests) that indigenous people rely on and have ancestral rights over (or should do). Those dangers need to be managed with regulations and other safeguards when, for example, those same forests are deemed as financially valuable in supplying a distant city with water, and when managing that water affect the rights of the people in the forest. There are risks but just outcomes can be secured.</p> <p>While I am alarmed at how some environmentalists reject the economic valuation of nature, I am more alarmed still at how such a position can appear similar to those with deeply sceptical views about whether we should protect the environment in the first place. Nigel Lawson, the arch climate change denier, is like many environmentalists dead against putting financial values on nature. He knows well that if this happens then economics would have to change in fundamental ways requiring new government policies, changes to how capital is invested and shifts in consumption patterns. By campaigning against the valuation of ecosystem services, some campaigners could inadvertently strengthen the hand of those who believe nature has little or no value, moral, economic or otherwise.</p> <p>And it seems to me there is not a choice here. I have spent the past 25 years campaigning for nature for its own sake, because it is beautiful, because it should exist for its own reasons and because we have no right to destroy it. I have found that not everyone agrees with that though, and while I am trying to convince them, more forests are cleared, oceans polluted and greenhouse gases released.</p> <p>We could carry on like this, with ideological purity preserved (on all sides), or we could open a new discourse, one that requires the sceptics to meaningfully engage, and on the field where future environmental battles will be won and lost \u2013 the field of economics. After all, it is not most environmentalists who have misunderstood the realities that come with 'growth' a finite Earth, but most economists.</p> <p>\u2022 Tony Juniper's book on the value of ecosystems for economies, What has Nature ever done for us? will be published in January</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has defended the government's commitment to overseas aid funding at a time of recession, as he prepares to co-host a hunger summit in Downing Street on the closing day of the Olympics.</p> <p>Despite admitting there was \"no one single answer\" to world hunger, the prime minister on Friday outlined his hopes for the outcomes of the summit of world leaders this Sunday.</p> <p>Co-hosted with Michel Temer, the Brazilian vice-president, where the 2016 Games will take place, the event is designed to show that the Olympic family is aware of the gaping inequalities faced by competitors. It is likely to set a target to reduce the number of children left stunted by malnourishment worldwide by as much as 17 million by 2016.</p> <p>Mo Farah, the Somalian-born British 10000m gold medal winner, is expected to be among a clutch of sports figures to attend.</p> <p>Cameron told ITV1's Daybreak: \"I wanted to do this during the Olympic Games. We are all thinking about the next gold medal, but there are millions of children around the world who are thinking: 'Am I going to get the next meal?'</p> <p>\"There are 170 million children who are malnourished. In some cases it results in death, but in a lot of cases it results in stunting, it means people don't reach their full potential and have all sorts of restrictions and illnesses later on in life.\"</p> <p>In reference to the government's overseas aid funding level during a double-dip recession, the prime minister said: \"I think most people recognise that when there are 170 million people around the world suffering from malnutrition, when there are millions of people living on less than a dollar a day, even at a tough time in Britain, we are right to meet our aid commitments.\"</p> <p>Cameron made his comments on Friday as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19204777\" title=\"\">a petition from aid charities calling for action against global hunger signed by 500,000</a> was due to be delivered to Downing Street.</p> <p>Although it is not a pledge-making summit in terms of donations, the government regards the summit as a way to provide an international legacy of the Games and to show that Cameron wants to make malnourishment a big issue in the lead-up to the British presidency of the G8 next year. It will be the first time Britain has held the presidency since Tony Blair's aid-pledging G8 summit in Gleneagles in 2005.</p> <p>The primary goal is to highlight child malnutrition and its resulting physical stunting as the chief area where progress is lacking in the development field. A global target to reduce the number of stunted children by 40%, or 70 million, by 2025 has been agreed by the World Health Assembly.</p> <p>The summit is likely to focus on more short-term targets.</p> <p>On Friday US agriculture department will talk at the summit about how the worst drought in 60 years in the US midwest is pushing up global food prices and increasing hunger in Africa. Wheat prices rose by 19% on international markets in July alone.</p> <p>Andrew Mitchell, the secretary of state for international development, said on Friday that not enough was being done to tackle a problem that saw millions go to bed starving every night.</p> <p>It was an opportune time to galvanise support by putting a \"real flag in the sand\" about the importance of tackling malnutrition, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p> <p>\"We've made good progress in a number of areas. We've made good progress this year on family planning where British leadership will mean that up to half the women who want contraception today but don't have it will be able to get it,\" Mitchell said. \"But not enough is being done to tackle malnutrition and this is a real chance for Britain and Brazil to say something about galvanising world support in this important area.\"</p> <p>Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of the charity Save the Children, said malnutrition was the achilles heel of development. \"We just cannot stumble from one food emergency to another. It is not just about how much people eat, but also the nutritional value, as well as breastfeeding. There are techniques to fortify crops, or provide specific products such as fortified biscuits.\"</p> <p>He said Cameron should be praised for tackling the problem. \"When Britain adopts an issue in the field of aid, the momentum changes. Probably a million lives have been saved since Cameron called the vaccines summit [in June 2011].\"</p> <p>Britain has been a supporter of the Scaling Up Nutrition movement since it began in 2010.</p> <p>The charity Oxfam warned ahead of the summit that rising global food prices could pile more pressure on an overstretched humanitarian system, which is already struggling to cope with food crises in the Sahel region of west Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Yemen.</p> <p>A recent multi-country study showed that for every 10% increase in levels of stunting among children, the proportion of children reaching the final year of school dropped by almost 8%. One study in Guatemala showed that improving growth in children aged under two resulted in a 46% increase in adult wages when those children grew up.</p> <p>It is estimated 80% of stunted children live in 24 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. In 18 countries more than 45% of children under five are stunted.</p> <p>Forsyth said that while more children survived past their fifth birthday and attended school at the end of the 2000s than a decade before, a rise in acute malnutrition could undermine those unprecedented gains.</p> <p>The Department for International Development claims nutrition-specific initiatives, such as high-energy wheat biscuits, can only reduce global stunting by a third, the remaining two-thirds will need to be tackled through nutrition-sensitive development. This involves adjusting and redesigning programmes across a range of sectors, including agriculture, environmental health and cash transfer programmes, to ensure that they deliver nutritional results.</p>",
  "<p>Google's Android mobile operating system tightened its grip on the smartphone market in the second quarter of 2012, making up 68.1% of the 154m shipments worldwide, <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23638712\">according to the research company IDC</a>.</p> <p>Overall, the smartphone market grew at 42.2%, meaning that Android and Microsoft's Windows Phone were the only platforms which grew faster than the overall market. Shipments of Apple's iPhone grew by 27.5% to 26m, not enough to maintain its share from last year of 18.8%; its share fell to 16.9%.</p> <p>But overall the market remains a two-horse race, with the two principal platforms - Android and iOS - making up 85% of the market, with the remaining 15% shared between four main platforms.</p> <p>And the concentration of control is also emphasised by the fact that two companies, Apple and Samsung, controlled 49.5% of the world smartphone market. </p> <p>Nokia, Taiwan's HTC, China's ZTE and RIM together shipped 34.4m, or 22.3% of the market - leaving a huge number of other vendors fighting for the remaining share. Most of those are sold into China via MediaTek, and run Android. China is now the world's largest smartphone market, with low-cost Android phones dominating even more than in the worldwide market. In the US, the second-biggest market. Apple's iPhone has around 50% share, aided by subsidies from carriers that make it no more expensive than many mid-range Android handsets.</p> <p>ZTE's rise, with 8m handsets shipped, came principally through low-cost devices in China but is also working on sales in the US - though IDC observed that its lack of strong brand recognition could be a problem if it wants to see high sales growth outside China. </p> <p>However the growth in the smartphone market segment - which accounted for 37.9% of the overall mobile market of 406m in the second quarter, according to <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23624612\">separate IDC analysis</a> - was the slowest since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the world was still recovering from the global crash precipitated by Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in mid-2008. </p> <p>That has analysts wondering whether economic problems particularly in Europe will seriously crimp worldwide growth both in feature phones and smartphones. Ramon Llamas, senior research analyst with IDC's mobile phone team, said: \"Despite recent maneouvres to shore up several countries within the eurozone, the effectiveness of these efforts remains to be seen. Meanwhile, emerging markets will continue to be strong contributors due to their sheer size and growth trajectory, but how much they can offset potential declines in other countries is unclear.\"</p> <p>RIM saw shipments fall from 12.5m a year ago to 7.4m - a 4.8% share, its lowest in more than five years years, while the eclipse of Nokia's Symbian, which once dominated the smartphone market, was demonstrated as shipments fell to 6.8m - just 4.4% of the market, 15 months after it was earmarked for phasing out by Stephen Elop, Nokia's chief executive.</p> <p>But Windows Phone, Nokia's new platform, remains low, shipping roughly 5.4m handsets - almost all due to Nokia - to more than double the number shipped, but only grew its share from 3.0% to 3.5%.</p> <p>\"Android continues to fire on all cylinders,\" said Llamas. \"The market was entreated to several flagship models from Android's handset partners, prices were well within reach to meet multiple budgetary needs, and the user experience from both Google and its handset partners boosted Android smartphones' utility far beyond simple telephony.\"</p> <p>\"The mobile OS market is now unquestionably a two-horse race due to the dominance of Android and iOS,\" said Kevin Restivo, IDC senior research analyst for mobile phones. \"With much of the world's mobile phone user base still operating feature phones, the smartphone OS market share battle is far from over. There is still room for some mobile OS competitors to gain share, although such efforts will become increasingly difficult as smartphone penetration increases.\"</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Miller, the chief executive of Guardian Media Group, took a 10% pay cut and has elected to waive a \u00a3174,000 bonus in the year to the end of March, in which the company reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a375.6m.</p> <p>GMG's annual report published on Friday provides more detail on the performance of the company, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/17/guardian-observer-report-losses-44m?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">which last month revealed</a> that its Guardian News &amp; Media subsidiary \u2013 publisher of the Guardian, Observer, and theguardian.com website network, including MediaGuardian \u2013 posted a loss before exceptional items and amortisation of \u00a344.2m.</p> <p>The \u00a375.6m pre-tax loss compares to a \u00a39m profit the previous year. A large chunk of the loss is due to a \u00a354.2m write-off of the value of GMG Radio, which was sold to Global Radio in June for about \u00a370m, to reflect the true worth of the operation.</p> <p>Overall revenue for GMG from continuing businesses was \u00a3254.4m, compared with \u00a3255.1m the previous year.</p> <p>Miller received a \u00a3642,000 remuneration package in the year to the end of March, according to GMG's annual report published on Friday.</p> <p>This represents a 12% increase year on year, as a result of his promotion from finance director to chief executive.

Stuart Taylor, the former chief executive of GMG Radio, took an \u00a382,000 bonus to take his total remuneration to \u00a3404,000. He also received a pension contribution of \u00a394,000.</p> <p>Taylor left the business earlier this year after GMG Radio, including the Smooth and Real Radio brands, was sold to Global Radio, owner of stations including Capital FM and Classic FM.</p> <p>GMG's annual report shows that the radio business made an underlying operating profit of \u00a32.5m, up from \u00a3900,000 the year before, meaning the business was sold at an extremely high multiple of earnings.</p> <p>Chief financial officer Darren Singer also took a bonus, of \u00a382,000, to take his total remuneration to \u00a3374,000. He also received \u00a385,000 in pension contributions.</p> <p>The total remuneration paid to GMG's directors was \u00a32.18m, down almost 21% year on year, although pension contributions rose 15% to \u00a3437,000.</p> <p>The reason for the large drop in director pay was because a \u00a3510,000 payout was included in the previous year's accounts made to Tim Brooks, the former managing director of GNM, when he resigned in February 2011.</p> <p>GMG's annual report reveals that Trader Media Group, of which the company owns 50.1%, reported operating profit before exceptional items up from \u00a3118.6m to \u00a3128.7m.</p> <p>GMG also owns 32.9% of Top Right Group, formerly Emap, which increased underlying operating profits slightly at \u00a378.7m.</p> <p>GNM, which is pushing through \u00a325m in cuts over five years and seeking 70 to 100 voluntary redundancies from its editorial staff, reported a loss of \u00a344.2m last year.</p> <p>This is up from \u00a331.1m in the prior year due to increased investment in areas including digital and the Guardian America launch.</p> <p>GNM's revenues were \u00a3196.2m, compared with \u00a3198.2m the previous year.</p> <p>Digital revenues for GNM rose 16.3% year on year to \u00a345.7m, within this digital advertising rose 26% to \u00a314.7m. Print advertising shrunk 4% to \u00a343.7m.</p> <p>Miller said: \"It has, by any standards, been a remarkable year for GMG. The group's strategy is to use its portfolio of assets to support the Guardian while we go through the tumultuous period that the media industry is experiencing. This gives us the huge advantage of being able to navigate our core business, Guardian News &amp; Media.\"</p> <p>Fawcett said: \"At Guardian Media Group, securing a sustainable future for quality journalism has been our number one priority during the last year.</p> <p>\"It is early days but GNM is meeting its targets. Digital revenue growth is as we forecast, and for the first time has largely offset declines in print revenue \u2013 a significant milestone. The increase in GNM's operating loss is in line with our projections and reflects planned investments. These critical investments have been made possible through the headroom provided by large-scale savings.</p> <p>\"This gives us great confidence that GNM will meet its target of reducing losses to a sustainable level across a five year period.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Do you like beards? I like beards. But I know plenty of women who don't. Most adult men I know don't have beards. Which is weird, when you think about it. Because beards are a biological signal. A signal that says, \"I am a sexually mature male, ready for mating. I have excellent genes and will impregnate you with fine children. Mate with me ladies.\" They are the human equivalent of peacocks' tails.</p> <p>From an evolutionary standpoint, shaving off beards makes no sense, so why do many men do it? I'll tell you why. It's because human beings are highly complex social animals embedded in highly complex social systems. Culture, fashion and what-other-people-do have an enormous influence on us. So much so they can completely confound our biological programming. So when evolutionary psychology looks at mate choice in humans, it needs to bear in mind this inconvenient fact. Which means I take this recent Telegraph headline, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9461799/Stressed-men-prefer-larger-women.html\" title=\"\">\"Stressed men prefer larger women\"</a>, with something of a pinch of salt.</p> <p>This reports on a <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0042593\" title=\"\">study in PloS ONE</a> in which they gave some white, male, Westminster undergraduates a mock job interview, then showed them pictures of women of a range of body types, and asked them which they found attractive. They found that the \"stressed\" students picked slightly larger women than the control group. And concluded that when we experience acute stress (indicating, perhaps, a threatening environment), we become more attracted to bodies that suggest maturity as it makes us feel safer.</p> <p>I know we shouldn't get exercised about subheadings, which are generally not written by the author (and certainly not by the scientists). But, I give you: \"Tightening one's belt in a recession is usually considered prudent, but women may be advised to do the opposite after a study found that in tough times stressed men turn to larger ladies for comfort.\" Oh no, we thought we were supposed to be thin, but now we might have made ourselves too thin for boys to like us! Let us cry hopelessly into our pillows ladies.</p> <p>Thing is, there's a massive difference between the adrenaline and cortisol burst from a 10-minute mock job interview, and the complex physiological effects of long-term stress such as unemployment, poverty or economic uncertainty. A recession, for those at the sharp end, is really nothing like a few minutes of embarrassment.</p> <p>To be fair, neither the scientists nor the bulk of the article make the recession comparison, they simply talk about stress. But there are other problems. White university undergraduates in London are not representative or typical of all human beings. Not only are they young, educated, well-fed, but they are embedded within one particular complex social system. Jane Austen's heroines develop accomplishments such as embroidery and piano playing to impress potential husbands. I think my boyfriend is a lot more impressed by me always carrying a penknife than my grade one piano certificate. The sensible strategies for life in one complex social system are not necessarily the sensible strategies for life in <em>another</em> complex social system. We can't draw conclusions about all humanity, or about our evolutionary programming, from the behaviour of 80 London undergraduates.</p> <p>There are also other possible explanations for these results. We live in a culture that sends us messages about what we are supposed to look like, and what we are supposed to find attractive. You see thousands of images of young, scantily clad women with unnatural body shapes every day. Of course this influences what people actually do and think. But even more, it influences what they <em>think</em> they think. And what they <em>say</em> they think. It may be that many men naturally prefer slightly larger women than we're presented with as the cultural ideal, and this is overlaid by an idea of what we are \"supposed\" to like. Perhaps stress makes this natural preference leak out more. Part of their brain is too busy worrying to remember what they are supposed to like. This isn't a possibility the scientists seem to have considered. Innate preferences is all, let's ignore the effects of cultural programming.</p> <p>There are thousands of psychology papers published every day. Why is it that a small and limited study, finding a very small effect, gets covered in the science media when so much else doesn't? Is this article, ironically, just another example of the cultural obsession with women's weight, which pop evolutionary psychology so studiously ignores?</p>",
  "<p>Look, Ian Thorpe's slightly eccentric sartorial style isn't the only thing that makes him misunderstood.</p> <p>Since being hired as a BBC commentator, the Australian five-time Olympic gold swimmer's propensity to begin every sentence with \"Look\" has unsettled viewers. It sounds formidable to the British ear \u2013 the tone-setting alert to the delivery of ominous news. But Thorpe delivers news of no such magnitude. The assertive instruction precedes such trivialities as the observation that the pool is quite wet.</p> <p>Perplexed tweeters have picked up on this. It has led to exploration of the nuances between the Aussie and Pommie vernaculars. \"Look\" is just one of the linguistics quirks I've noted since moving to Australia this year. We speak the same language, of course \u2013 but the tiny differences reveal much about our respective national characters.</p> <p>His fellow BBC commentator Gary Lineker took to Twitter to calm the irritation: \"Ian Thorpe in tonight. The \"look\" at the start of his answers is not aggressive, it's an Aussie thing. Look, he's great and a Spurs fan.\" Another tweeter answered the confusion: \"The Aussie 'look-' as Ian Thorpe uses sounds really pushy to UK ears, but is just punctuation to them, like 'err'. Interesting national tic.\"</p> <p>\"Look\" is indeed as much of a national tic as \"Cuppa?\" is to us Brits. \"Look, the pool was cold today,\" in Aussie-speak would be a statement of welcome relief; a respite from the burning Australian sun. In Pommie-speak, it'd be a complaint to the management that was supposed to be heating it.</p> <p>Many Aussie terms are similarly loaded with chipper positivity. An example is the \"GFC\" \u2013 the chirpy little acronym for Global Financial Crisis. In Britain, you hear the somewhat dry \"economic recession\". On better days we'll stretch to alliteration and call it the \"credit crunch\".</p> <p>The lyrics to the Australian Idol winner <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz_6Y0-Pv38\" title=\"\">Guy Sebastian's Don't Worry Be Happy</a> define the Aussie attitude towards the recession: \"That's it \u2013 screw the low carbs, where's my KFC? / Ain't gonna think about bills or the GFC.\" Profound? Maybe not. Uplifting? Absolutely. Naturally, it's easier to poke fun at the financial crisis in a country currently experiencing a mining boom. The UK's current biggest pop export, Adele, is yet to pen a bleak recession ballad. But give it time. It's bound to happen.</p> <p>GFC is a product of the Aussie tendency to abbreviate. This is not, as I first thought, out of laziness \u2013 but cheeriness. Even acronyms have their own acronyms \u2013 GFC is what I now know to be a TLA, a three-letter-acronym. It's all very meta. Best of all, it's upbeat. Sombre affairs are breezily abbreviated, as if to make them sound more bearable. As in: \"I watched a doco about geno last night \u2013 and it made me feel totes devo.\"</p> <p>As a slightly clueless Fob pom (Fresh Off the Boat Prisoner of Mother England \u2013 do keep up with the TLAs), certain phrases initially baffled me. \"I'm just going out in my thongs tonight!\" a new female friend declared in my first month here. My thoughts as they came to me were: a) do Aussies not wear skirts? b) do Aussies wear two thongs in case one snaps off and leaves them commando? \u2013 and eventually \u2013 c) why did nobody tell me thongs are flip flops? The onomatopoeia is infinitely more descriptive and saves humiliation all round.</p> <p>Another sticky moment came when a colleague burst into the work kitchen and announced: \"God, I've got the SHITS!\" I was about to offer her Imodium in an attempt to spare the vicarious embarrassment of further candid outbursts, until I remembered that, over here, this means you are quite annoyed by something.</p> <p>Look, I live for these moments. International tics are the cause of much hilarity. They aren't confined to Australianisms either; there's a Golden Girls episode where Betty White's character, Rose, defiantly declares \"And if you don't like it, you can kiss my fanny!\" It's one of the rare occasions the \"comedy\" series has actually incited something stronger than a muted chortle from me. The \"pause, rewind, play\" buttons on my remote have never been so abused.</p> <p>Back to the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McsWKczU6wc\" title=\"\">land down unde</a>r, and they're up over the moon about relatively banal occurrences. Never have I felt like such a misog. Sanguine phrases are inevitably followed with an exclamation mark, as if to intensify my cliched whingeing Pom status for failing to share the excitement. \"Too easy!\" is used when a solution has been found to a problem, such as unscrewing a stubbornly tight lid (\"Bloody typical\" is the British equivalent I use, complemented by an eye-roll). \"Happy days\" is verbalised when something goes your way, such as the sun being out to dry your washing (\"About bloody time, this is what I moved all this way for\" is my reaction to the same event). \"No worries\" is famous, but \"no dramas\" is one better (no reassuring British equivalent for this one, just the lingering silence of affirmation.) \"Outstanding\" is said sometimes just to fill an awkward gap in conversation and, just quietly, I actually quite like it.</p> <p>You can hear the sunshine in the Aussie accent. It shines brightest in those subtleties that differentiate Australian English from its British counterpart. Look, listen and you'll love it as secretly as I do.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.salesforce.com/uk/\" title=\"\">Salesforce</a>'s attempt to trademark 'social enterprise' and use the term to describe its products and services has mystified the social enterprise sector. It's a term that has been used for well over a decade to describe a way of doing business that exists to tackle social and environmental problems. So why Salesforce has now decided to legally adopt the term is baffling to say the least.</p> <p>As a sector, we're proud to use the term social enterprise. It fittingly describes our unique approach to business \u2013 social enterprises are primarily driven by a social mission and reinvest the majority of profits in pursuit of that mission.

  "<h2>Accrington Stanley </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> This summer has been the first in recent memory in which we have had a full squad signed up, more or less, before the end of July. For other clubs, a fulsome roster is viewed flippantly; however for Accrington it marks a progression in the professional ethos of the club and its ability to attract players. Perhaps the signing of the summer so far has been Aristote 'Toto' Nsiala upon his release from Everton. The Congolese centre-half brought his full blooded approach to the Crown Ground in a loan spell last season which saw hearty performances dotted with disciplinary indiscretions. A talented player expected to springboard onto greater things than Fleetwood away.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> The Stanley fans aren't like the fans of most other clubs. Seeing our club go from Frickley to Fulham encourages a somewhat cultured worldview. We are patient and have a positive approach to expectation, mostly. We ask for no more than committed performances and football played in the right way. Paul Cook seems to be delivering that superbly.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>An up-and-down season with a late purple patch strong enough to average out the youthful inconsistencies in the side. At best, a play-off push. At worst, a gentle slip into the bottom half. There'll be an injury crisis or two with emergency loans aplenty; making cult heroes from reserve team footballers. Marvellous.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Luke Clark is an exciting midfield talent. Signed from Preston North End with Evertonian roots, there is a pedigree about the player and a skilful touch. If he comes through the rough and tumble of basement league football, we could have a real bright spark in our midst.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> In the top half of the table. A cheeky eighth, perhaps. Nay, let's say sixth. Why not?</p> <p>Andrew O'Mara, <a href=\"http://andrewomarafootball.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">andrewomarafootball </a></p> <h2>Aldershot</h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Dean Holdsworth committing to the club after being linked with numerous other posts (most notably Creepy) was welcome news. He's not everyone's cup of tea but knows how to run a club of our limited means. For the first time in several seasons, we've got a bit of depth to our squad. With Craig Reid and Guy Madjo we also stand a bit of a chance of scoring, which makes a change.<br><strong>What the fans want</strong> Most Shots fans are realists. A run at the play-offs, playing the kind of attacking football that marked our promotion campaign of a few years ago would keep almost everyone happy. We'd also like a bigger crowd. We're never going to get anywhere on an average crowd of 2,800.<br><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> Mid-table in front of crowds of 2,800 with inexplicable patches of form where we're unable to score for games at a time.<br><strong>One to watch</strong> Like many other teams at this level, the use of long term loans is rife, but Hull's Sonny Bradley is a cracking player.<br><strong>We'll finish\u2026</strong> As ever, 'it's a poor league this year'. Upper mid-half, missing out on a play-off spot in the last two games.<br><strong>Finsbury Park, Aldershot fan</strong></p> <h2>AFC Wimbledon </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Well, that's got to be more comings and goings than Grand Central Station and the building of a new all-seater stand. After under-performing for most of the season, on what was to become known as Black Tuesday, 8 May, 14 first team players we released and Dons fans started to sweat. Terry Brown then slowly began to rebuild his decimated squad with some more experienced league players rather than the 20-year-olds that seemed to be taking over Kingsmeadow last season. Nothing wrong with 20-year-olds you understand, but as the saying goes, you don't win anything with kids. We're also building a new all-seater stand at the Kingston Road end of the ground which will help us become compliant with the leagues rules and regulations regarding fans and seating. This week the club also announced it's intention to convert Wimbledon greyhound stadium to our new permanent home. It'll be a long process but Plough Lane is where we belong.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> Optimistically we want the play-offs. There are experienced quality players like Warren Cummings, Stacy Long and Mat Mitchel-King at the Dons now and if Sammy Moore and Jack Midson keep up last season's good work we could end up in the play-offs.</p> <p><strong>What we'll actually get</strong> I think it will be a tough season. People found us out last year. I think we'll just miss out on the play-offs but not by too much. Personally, I'm in no rush for the club to get promoted \u2013 we don't want to rise too quickly because slow and steady wins this particular race. I also think that as long as Dons fans see some progress on and of the field we'll be happy.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Jim Fenlon has impressed me this pre-season. He looks like he could be quite a good attacking wing back. Good solid defensive work as well.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish</strong>.... ninth and I'll be happy with that.</p> <p>Glyn Roberts, AFC Wimbledon fan</p> <h2>Barnet </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Survival on the final day of the season for the third year running sparked a mass clear out of playing staff and backroom staff alike, with caretaker manager Martin Allen, assistant manager Guiliano Grazioli, and captain Mark Hughes, all departing the club. In Mark Robson, we have appointed a highly regarded young coach, who has focused primarily on bringing in young talent from the youth teams of the likes of West Ham and Charlton. The style of football during pre-season couldn't be any more different to the tactics employed by last season's manager Lawrie Sanchez, with players playing the ball to feet, and real work ethic evident throughout the team.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Most fans would simply be happy with mid-table obscurity, but as a minimum the last day scramble for survival has to be avoided. This is our last season at Underhill and after what supporters have had to endure for the last three seasons, the club owe the supporters a season with at least some highs, and demonstrate that the club is moving in the right direction.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Whilst pre-season's been encouraging in terms of our attacking play, defensively we still look short of what's required to survive in League Two. Mark Robson clearly has contacts in the higher leagues and our ability to finish in mid-table will largely be down to how well he can play the loan system. Mid-table isn't an unachievable target, but the squad at present is far from complete if this target is to be achieved.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>In Jordan Brown we have an outstanding left-back who could easily push on, and Anthony Edgar's attacking flair has also caught the eye during pre-season, but the one to watch for me will be Ahmed Abdullah \u2013 a tough tackling holding midfielder and product of the West Ham youth system.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Personally I struggle to see us finishing any higher than 13th, and that's not being disrespectful to our new coach or new playing staff. Some fans have suggested goals will be a problem, but I'm more concerned with our ability not to let them in. At this stage, I have to show some faith and predict an 18th place finish \u2013 that's success as far as I'm concerned!</p> <p><strong>Jeff Searle, Barnet fan</strong></p> <h2>Bradford City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Phil Parkinson has had a busy summer. I don't think any City fans were surprised by the released/retained list however I know some were panicking at the relatively slow start to the summer recruitment. I'll miss Lee Bullock and to an extent Michael Flynn, though the replacement signings are impressive. Season ticket sales were low before the surprise announcement that we'd signed Andrew Davies, followed by Rory McArdle, Gary Jones, Garry Thompson, Stephen Darby and perhaps disappointingly Will Atkinson. I think PP has made some astute signings and the squad has quality, if not a great deal of depth. James Meredith is one to watch and York fans were surprised he signed for City, after attracting interest from the Championship. The recent re-signing of Nathan Doyle is a good move \u2013 he was our player of the season in 2006-07. Alan Connell from Swindon is a surprising move, given he finished as their top scorer last season.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Promotion, in style. Swashbuckling, attacking football, with teams coming to Valley Parade and leaving humiliated, after another thrashing. In all seriousness, promotion in third spot or the play-offs would make the majority of us happy, given the underachievement of the last 12 or so years. A nice cup run with a few local derbies, like last season, would be a welcome distraction too.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I'm optimistic. If we can keep Nahki Wells and give James Hanson the service he needs, I think they'll bag 20 goals each. We've got a lot of quality this season and I have a lot of faith in Parkinson \u2013 promotion it is!</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Nakhi Wells. Finished the season in style with 12 goals. What he lacks in size, he more than makes up for in ability. He's strong, quick, confident and composed. I can see him in the Championship in a couple of years (hopefully with City).</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Second or third.</p> <p><strong>Ben Hoole, Bradford fan</strong></p> <h2>Bristol Rovers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>After taking over the reins from Paul Buckle in the middle of last season, new manager Mark McGhee inherited a squad made up largely of loan players, many of whom did not put pen to paper for a future at the club come the close of a rather disappointing 2011-12 season. The squad depleted rapidly as the likes of Cian Bolger, Aaron Downes and Tom Parkes were all retained by their parent clubs, while regular first-team faces Gary Sawyer and Craig Stanley left the club for pastures new. Also out the exit door was Chris Zebroski and, most recently, Mustapha Carayol, the latter of which was a big blow for the club, albeit not financially. The rumour mill hinted at a move for the creative livewire back in May, so it was no surprise when he jumped two divisions to join Middlesborough. However, for every player to leave the club, one has stayed. McGhee retained a handful of last season's promising players, including Lee Brown, Danny Woodards and Oliver Norburn. In terms of new blood at the club, the boss has dipped into the waters of international talent to add Faroe Islands international central defender Rogvi Baldvinsson and start negotiations with German midfielder Fabian Broghammer after his trial period at the club. McGhee also used his Scottish roots to bring Garry Kenneth and Dave Clarkson to the club.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>After the team fell drastically short of last season's predictions, the general consensus among fans now seems to be split 50-50. The more optimistic of fans will, once again, expect a promotion push while the other half are adamant not to start considering glory for fear of being disappointed if the club produce another average season.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Realistically, you'd be foolish to overlook Rovers as a strong team in League Two this year. While we start the season in a similar situation to that of last year \u2013 in terms of stepping onto the pitch with a largely new-look squad who need time to gel under a still relatively new management \u2013 there is a different feeling on the terraces. McGhee has the fans' belief and, providing he can ensure the team click early on in the season, there's no reason we cannot push on and challenge the top of the table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Shaquille Hunter could be one to keep an eye on this year. Six months ago, this 16-year-old wouldn't put pen to paper for a professional contract at the club but, after talking with Scott Sinclair, who started his career at the club before being bought by Chelsea, he later agreed to a deal that will become effective once he turns 17 at the end of August. The youngster is tipped to capably fill the shoes of his left-wing predecessor Carayol.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Fourth or fifth. Rovers recovered from the disappointment of relegation and found their feet in this league last season and that, plus the addition of a motivated new manager and experienced players, should all point in the direction of success. I don't think we'll storm the league the way some may expect us to, but I do predict we will be a force to be reckoned with and finish in a play-off spot comfortably. If we manage that, I wouldn't bet against us winning at Wembley a la 2007 as, as history has shown, we generally step up to the big occasions.</p> <p><strong>Maria Hudd, Bristol Rovers fan (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/@MariaHudd\" title=\"\"><strong>@MariaHudd</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Burton Albion </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Once the uncertainty of the Brewers' managerial post had been cleared up, new permanent boss Gary Rowett wasted no time in stamping his mark on the club after taking the reins from Paul Peschisolido. Several players were released and fresh impetus arrived in the shape of Robbie Weir, Zander Diamond, Damien McCrory, Marcus Holness, Dean Lyness and Lee Bell. It was no mystery that Albion's problems lay at the back \u2013 besides, they held the ignominious accolade of League Two's worst defence last campaign \u2013 but the capture of three defenders has gone some way to solving that issue. Hopefully.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>With a couple of gruelling, relegation-haunted seasons fresh in the memory, anything comfortable and vaguely stress-free (I don't think that's possible) would be welcome. Personally, I am craving a successful top-half finish \u2013 something we are yet to achieve as a Football League club. Anything better should be considered a significant bonus.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Scoring goals is unlikely to be an issue so, if we can stop conceding them, who knows? That'll be the key. Overall, I don't see us as relegation contenders (unlike the bookies) though, perhaps, promotion may be a step too far.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Matty Palmer. A young central midfielder breaking through from Albion's youth set-up, Rowett has already hailed his skill on the ball as \"the best at the club\". He'll certainly be in and around the first team squad.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>I'll play safe and opt for a solid mid-table finish.</p> <p><strong>Luca Gallone, </strong><a href=\"http://burtonfootballnut.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>burtonfootballnut</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/lucabafc\" title=\"\"><strong>@lucabafc</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Cheltenham Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Like the Mounties, Mark Yates always gets his man \u2013 and this has been the case with the arrivals of Shaun Harrad and Chris Zebroski. He tried to sign Zebroski last January, and when he got wind that the 25-year-old might be available, he pounced quickly. Same goes for Harrad, a prolific scorer at Burton, but a player who has then seen his career go awry, first at Northampton, and then at Bury, who say he is not in their plans and have allowed him to come to Whaddon Road. That will be our gain if Yates can get him firing and he is good for 15-plus goals \u2013 and with the pace of Zebroski, Jermaine McGlashan and Kaid Mohamed, as well as the creativity of Sam Deering and Marlon Pack, goals should not be a problem. Deering was always impressive against us for Barnet, and will bring more guile to our midfield, and Billy Jones has come in to be first-choice at left-back with loanee Luke Garbutt now back at Everton. Jones will be the only new face in the first-choice back four, with Alan Bennett and Steve Elliott solid at centre-half and at right-back cult hero Sido Jombati is looking to enhance his growing reputation. Behind them, there is no Jack Butland \u2013 Rubies fans were proud to see him star for Team GB this summer, as well as going to Euro 2012 \u2013 but Scott Brown ended last season in top form and has maintained that in pre-season. Yates is still looking for back-up to Brown, and wants another central midfielder to complete his squad \u2013 but on paper it looks a stronger group with more competition for places than last season.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>At the very least, the fans want to be in play-offs again after last season's near miss. But the expectation level has risen, and many fans believe the Rubies should be going all-out to get into the top three.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>League Two seems to get tougher every season, and with Fleetwood coming up with some impressive signings and Rotherham keen to make their mark in their new stadium, as well as Bristol Rovers, Bradford, Gillingham and Oxford looking to improve and relegated sides Wycombe, Chesterfield and Exeter out to bounce straight back, it will be a tough ask to make the top three. I think the Rubies will be in the top 10, and challenging for the play-offs.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Sido Jombati. The Portuguese right-back came in from Bath, and once he got his place in the side he quickly became a cult hero, and got an extended contract. If he maintains his form, he will attract some higher-division scouts for sure.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Somewhere in the top 10. If we get off to a good start and hit the straps quickly we can challenge for the top three, but we need to guard against tailing off as we did towards the end of last season. Personally, I will be delighted with another play-off place and view anything on top of that as a bonus.</p> <p><strong>Mark Halliwell, </strong><a href=\"http://cheltenhamtownchatter.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cheltenham Town Chatter</strong></a></p> <h2>Chesterfield </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Not surprisingly revolution has been in the air following the disappointment of last season's relegation. Ten players were shown the door including stalwarts Derek Niven and Gregor Robertson, as well as a couple that flattered to deceive last term in Jimmy Juan and Alex Mendy. A deliberate thinning of the squad has meant fewer arrivals, however those that have joined look quality additions. Striker Marc Richards is a proven 20-goals-a-season striker who is more than welcome after the side desperately missed a goal scorer last season. Former Leeds and Doncaster Rovers defender Sam Hird looks another quality addition and has been installed as captain. Other recruits include midfielder Sam Togwell from Scunthorpe, defender Terrell Forbes from Leyton Orient and goalkeeper Richard O'Donnell from Sheffield Wednesday. It's nice to see three players from the youth team being awarded professional contracts with Jacob Hazel, Jonathan Wafula and Jack Waddle, the son of former England international Chris, being given their chance to shine. It looks like John Sheridan has gone for quality rather than quantity and fingers crossed the wrongs of last term can be put right.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Simple \u2013 promotion. An immediate return to League One is a reasonable expectation having won this league so convincingly only a couple of years ago. Quality and experience seems to have been added to a trimmer looking squad giving fans every reason to be quietly optimistic.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>With changes to the squad and having to readjust to life back in League Two, fans may have to be patient while Sheridan finds a winning formula. Unfortunately that's one thing a lot of fans will be struggling to offer him as the disappointment from last season will no doubt linger until results and performances give hope. I'm confident we'll be there or there about's come the end of the season and an automatic spot is not out of the question.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>I'm going to go with the same player I tipped to breakthrough last season and that's striker Jordan Bowery. He was by far the most improved player last season and was one of the few players to come out of the mess we made for ourselves with some credit. He led the line with pace and power after an injury then a suspension left Jack Lester missing for a lot of the season. His only problem may be getting in the side with a fit Jack Lester and new signing Marc Richards standing in his way.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Last seasons prediction of mid-table, possibly pushing for play-offs was way off the mark. Therefore take this with a huge pinch of salt but I feel slightly more confident in predicting a minimum of a play-off place.</p> <p><strong>Dean Mansell, </strong><a href=\"http://www.awayend.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Away End </strong></a></p> <h2>Dagenham &amp; Redbridge </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> The summer started with a clearout, as veterans Jon Nurse and captain Mark Arber were not offered new deals, along with other first-team regulars Damien McCrory and Peter Gain. Further exits in the shape of Adam Cunnington, Richard Rose, Gavin Tomlin and Ahmed Abdulla mean we've drastically trimmed our oversized squad, whilst only Gavin Hoyte and youngster Andrew Burns have arrived. Although injuries and a little desperation led us to keeping such a large number of players towards the end of last season, there is definitely some cost-cutting occurring here and we may lack a little cover in some areas. The biggest plus point of the summer has been securing some of our prized assets on long contracts. New captain Abu Ogogo, midfielder Billy Bingham, and forwards Brian Woodall and Dwight Gayle have all signed three-year deals.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want \u2026</strong> After last season's disaster we aren't looking beyond mid-table. If we can keep our players fit it should be achievable, but that isn't a given after the huge amount of serious injuries we picked up last time around. I think we are also hoping some of our players can kick on and fulfil their potential with a slightly more attractive brand of football. Mickey Spillane is superb at keeping possession from centre-half with his calm distribution on the floor, and the likes of Bingham, Matt Saunders and Dominic Green are skilful and comfortable on the ball.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I wouldn't be surprised if we are fighting at the wrong end of the table for at least part of the season. We will be asking a lot of a young squad to play consistently at this level, and inevitably some very inexperienced players will have a part to play at some stage. There may be a lot of pressure on Woodall's shoulders after he grabbed 13 goals in his first season as a pro, with Sam Williams lacking goalscoring pedigree, Josh Scott struggling with form since serious injury and Gayle still unproven.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Dwight Gayle is the obvious candidate after scoring 42 goals on loan at Bishop's Stortford last season. There is real excitement at Victoria Road that he could be our next big star although we must be careful to ease him in. If Dominic Green can stay injury free I'm also tipping him to tap into the huge potential that saw him sold to Peterborough in his first spell with us.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Last time around I said 10th which proved incredibly optimistic, so this time I'm going to back off a little and say 14th.</p> <p><strong>Mark, </strong><a href=\"http://www.9-men.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>We Only Need Nine Men </strong></a></p> <h2>Exeter City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> On paper the spine of the team - Richard Duffy, David Noble, Daniel Nardiello, James Dunne and Troy Archibald-Henville - have departed, but while these are all talented players they were part of a squad that didn't gel. Pat Baldwin and Alan Gow have signed permanently while other signings such as Kevin Amankwaah, Arron Davies and Tommy Doherty may not be marquee names but are possibly the sort of unfussy signings Exeter need. At the time of writing, another striker would be nice though, and it's not out of the question Jamie Cureton could return for another spell.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A lot of the younger or more optimistic fans expect us to bounce straight back into League One, either via the play-offs or automatically. The older, more realistic fans would take top half with a tilt at the play-offs.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A wild swing between despair when we lose our first two games, convincing everybody we'll be relegated, and elation when we occupy second in November before everything grinding to a halt for an anticlimactic mid-table finish.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Teenager Tom Nicholls had a decent loan spell at Dorchester, regularly finding the back of the net. Director of football Steve Perryman rates him highly and it wouldn't be a shock if he hit double figures.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>On the fringes of the play-offs, probably falling around three points short</p> <p><strong>Gary Andrews, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/gafootbl\" title=\"\"><strong>@gafootbl</strong></a></p> <h2><strong>Fleetwood Town</strong></h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> After the euphoria of last season it's back to reality and back down to hard work for the manager, players and members of the club's board. Valuable team members of recent seasons in Gareth Seddon, Sean Clancy have departed, as has the best ever non-league player in Jamie Vardy, who has moved to Leicester for a seven figure sum. Special mention should also go to Richard Brodie who scored a few important goals for us. But we needed some experience, and the signings of what will be hopefully great League Two players in Damien Johnson, Jon Parkin, Barry Nicholson and Steven Gillespie have made teams in League Two sit up and take note that we are not here to make up the numbers.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Tough one with it being are first season ever in the Football League. Some say top 10, some say play-off shake-up, some want automatic and the title! In my honest opinion, with the squad and signings made, I will be very disappointed if were are not in top seven come the end of season.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I believe the fans will get a top seven finish and that would represent a great debut season regardless of what other fans from Fleetwood or other teams may say (I would actually love a trip to Wembley, as would many of the younger fans who never experienced the FA Vase final in 1985).</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>We have had a few promising youngster who have come and gone without a whisper \u2013 Adam Sumner, Joe Camozzi and Jack Duggan to mention a few \u2013 but going of what I hear from people within and around the club there are high hopes for new first year pro Jamie Allen. He's got great skill and ability and has made an impression within the first team squad already by all accounts, so we'll be hoping he works hard and gets a chance to shine.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Somewhere between third and fifth.</p> <p><strong>Sean Slater, Fleetwood Town fan</strong></p> <h2>Gillingham </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Found guilty of racial discrimination, temporarily evicted from their training ground and a two-month wait to discover the identity of Andy Hessenthaler's replacement as manager \u2013 it would probably be fair to say that Gillingham FC have had better summers. Six wins out of seven pre-season games since Martin Allen's belated arrival has helped to bring back a little of that feelgood factor, although strengthening one or two key positions with some of the funds from Paulo Gazzaniga's sale to Southampton would see the optimism increase further. Strikers Deon Burton and Ben Strevens, goalkeeper Stuart Nelson and Allen's son Charlie have arrived at the club after a trimming of the squad saw many of the old guard moved on, but hanging on to fans' favourite Jack Payne could yet prove to be the most significant story of the summer.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> The answer to that question is simple: a meaningful push for promotion. For the past two seasons Gillingham have promised much but delivered very little, with consecutive eighth-place finishes underlining our propensity for flattering to deceive. An automatic spot might be pushing it, but a season setting the pace amongst the play-off pack rather than straggling behind ought to keep the majority happy.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Hopefully just that. Mad Dog might be famed for excelling in relegation battles rather than promotion campaigns, but he seems to have wasted no time in identifying and addressing the key failings that let us down last year. His emphasis on fitness, tactical organisation, and passing football ought to see an improvement both on the pitch and in the league table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Adam Birchall is looking sharp and eager for a second tilt at league football having missed the whole of last season with a serious knee injury sustained shortly after his arrival from Dover. Also keep an eye out for Bradley Dack who is sure to be the next academy product pushing for some first-team action.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish\u2026</strong> Blind faith is never stronger than at this time of year, but I genuinely believe that we'll be in the mix. I'll go for fifth.</p> <p><strong>Tom Clee </strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tomclee13\" title=\"\"><strong>@tomclee13</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href=\"http://gills365.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>Gills 365</strong></a></p> <h2>Morecambe </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> The two biggest departures of the summer have been Lawrence Wilson who left in search of football at a higher level (and ended up at Rotherham) and Garry Hunter who was released after nine years of service to the club. Phil Jevons and Paul Scott also left the club before the end of last season. In their place, we have brought in Bradford's Robbie Threlfall, Scunthorpe's Andy Wright and Crawley's Richard Brodie. Once again we are going with a reduced squad this year which means we are going to be heavily relying on youth and/or hoping we do not have an injury crisis.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Optimistically, Morecambe fans would hope for a top-half finish, perhaps pushing for a play-off place. An improved home record from the last couple of seasons would be most appreciated having only won six times at home last season. Kevin Ellison to win the Golden Boot would be great too!</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Realistically, this is looking like our toughest season yet with an even smaller squad and one that is heavily relying on younger players. After showing relegation form for the last seven months of the previous season, we must start the season well to avoid getting into a scrap at the bottom of the table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Andy Fleming had a torrid time with injuries last season but is looking sharp in pre-season. We are also hoping young strikers Jordan Burrow and Jack Redshaw will make a big contribution this year.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Lower-mid table.</p> <p><strong>Jack Steer, Morecambe fan (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/morecambejack\" title=\"\"><strong>@morecambejack</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Northampton Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It's been an eventful summer at Sixfields with plenty released and a smaller squad being built by Aidy Boothroyd for his first full season in charge. Chris Hackett and Ishmel Demontagnac have been brought in to give us pace going forward whilst Clive Platt's arrival from Coventry should give Bayo Akinfenwa some stiff competition up front. The big departure was that of Michael Jacobs who rejected a new contract in order to join Derby County.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>I think a place in the top half would be very welcome after two seasons of relegation battles with the more optimistic fans looking at an outside shout of the play-offs.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Realistically I do think we should be able to avoid another season of struggle and with the squad that we've put together so far and a full season under Boothroyd there's no reason why we can't improve and progress in the league this season.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>With Jacobs gone, the one that might come through is striker Lewis Wilson who was starting to feature at the back end of last season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Top half</p> <p><strong>Danny Brothers, </strong><a href=\"http://aloadofcobblers2012.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>A Load of Cobblers</strong></a><strong> </strong></p> <h2>Oxford United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong>\u3000Steadying the ship is the order for this summer with minimal movements in and out on the playing side. The most eye-catching signing has probably been Sean Rigg from Port Vale. The winger/striker bagged double figures for the Valiants last season and a number of clubs were chasing his signature. His pre-season form indicates Oxford may have got themselves a bargain. Aside from this, new chairman Ian Lenegan has moved from his position as non-executive director to push the club forward. He has stated his intention to emulate his success at Wigan Warriors rugby club with a host of exciting changes in the offing.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Promotion is the only aim. Lenegan has demanded it and Oxford fans crave it. With a late season collapse seeing United miss out on the play-offs last season, the same must not happen again. Perhaps top spot is beyond the team, but a top three finish is a must.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>It is not unrealistic for Oxford to finish in the automatic spots. Many in and around the club blame an injury list as long as your arm for last season's disappointing end and one of Lenegan's key measures is to improve fitness in the whole squad.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Youth development has taken a battering at the club during the wilderness years, so it's slim pickings. However, Tyrone Marsh is on the fringes and could be called upon if injuries and suspensions play a part.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Heavy investment in state-of-the-art sport science equipment and software should see an Oxford side capable of lasting the distance this time round. We'll finish third.</p> <p><strong>Tony Fallows, </strong><a href=\"http://www.rageonline.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>RageOnline </strong></a></p> <h2>Plymouth Argyle </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>It's been a quiet one, as the club slowly finds its feet after the chaos of the last three years. Carl Fletcher, who continues as manager after signing a new Guardiola-style rolling contract, has declined to splash the cash in the transfer market; with the horrors of administration fresh in the memory, financial prudence has been the order of the day at Home Park and a compensation payment to Woking for Paris Cowan-Hall is the closest Argyle have come to coughing up a transfer fee. The 21-year-old forward has been followed by four more free signings in the form of goalkeeper Rene Gilmartin, midfielder Jamie Lowry, winger Andres Gurrieri and Welsh Premier League goal machine Rhys Griffiths. Captain Simon Walton has departed for Hartlepool, knocking a hefty chunk off the wage bill.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A season free from relegation worries, ideally with a bit of a play-off push, would do us nicely. And 12 points from the games with Torquay and Exeter wouldn't go amiss either.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>The defensive unit that played such a vital part in last season's successful battle against the drop should keep us out of the relegation dogfight this time around. What can be achieved beyond that is likely to depend on the quality of whichever attacking players Fletch can bring in on loan.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Luke Young forced his way into the team as a wide midfielder during the second half of last season; the 19-year-old is now hoping for the chance to impress in his favoured central position.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Lower mid-table.</p> <p><strong>Mark Anderson, </strong><a href=\"http://argyleoutsider.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Argyle Outsider </strong></a></p> <h2>Port Vale </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Summer transfers have been overshadowed by events off the pitch. The coronation of Keith Ryder as the club's new owner once looked a formality, but at time of writing it still hasn't happened. Events reached farcical proportions as Ryder continues to promise to conclude the deal in 24 hours and Vale fans worry that the club may have to start the season in administration and running out of money. Throw in a thinly veiled attack by the city council (who underwrote administration), fan infighting plus the controversy of the club attempting to hold friendlies behind closed doors and you have all the ingredients of a highly controversial summer.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Stability as the fanbase was badly fragmented following the protests against the former board. The Supporters Club have done an excellent job in trying to unite the fans but divisions remain. If Keith Ryder can deliver success on the pitch, then that may finally reunite the Vale supporters.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong> The protracted summer takeover is only going to make it harder for the new owner (if we get one) to turn things around. On the pitch, Vale will have to replace the goals of the departed Marc Richards which may prove harder than some believe.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>I think this could be a big season for Jennison Myrie-Williams. His career so far has been fits and starts, so I'm hoping that regular first-team football at Vale will bring the best out of him.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I've said \"top-half with hopefully a play-off push\" in the last two season previews. Let's hope I'm third time lucky \u2026</p> <p><strong>Rob Fielding, </strong><a href=\"http://www.onevalefan.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>One Vale Fan </strong></a></p> <h2>Rochdale </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It's been a funny summer at Rochdale with plenty of ups and downs. Of course we had relegation to come to terms with and the inevitable exit of a number of key players. Perhaps most difficult was the departure of captain Gary Jones who left for Bradford City. Our pre-season games were a bit hit-and-miss with a lot of trialists and younger lads being given chances, and the only game we seemed to play at full strength was our 3-1 win against Burnley. In the past couple of weeks we seem to have lifted our spirits slightly, John Coleman has made a few decent signings including a number of young loanees who will be interesting to see develop and a few days ago we signed Dele Adebola who we hope will bring us a bit more experience.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Obviously, as all football fans, we want promotion. We don't want another 36 consecutive seasons in the bottom rung of the Football League and I don't think we deserve that either. We want to see passion and drive from the players, and want to see Rochdale back up there like we were a couple of seasons ago.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I see us doing quite well. The team is fairly young with a few mature players thrown into the mix along with an experienced management team with knowledge of this level. There will be struggles along the way, I don't doubt that, but I also see plenty of highs too and I think we'll get a pretty exciting season with a new team to get to know.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>We've brought in a few loan signings from Premier League clubs so they'll be interesting to keep an eye on \u2013 Joe Rafferty from Liverpool, Ryan Edwards from Blackburn Rovers and Rhys Bennett from Bolton. I also see Andrew Tutte developing a lot this season, especially as he's been named vice captain.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I'd hope that we'd aim at least for a top half table finish. Although the squad is pretty much completely new, manager John Coleman has a lot of experience in League Two that I think will prove pivotal for us this season. Ideally, I'd like to see us challenging in a play-off position.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Lomas, </strong><a href=\"http://www.girlonaterrace.com\" title=\"\"><strong>GirlOnATerrace</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/GirlOnATerrace\" title=\"\"><strong>@GirlOnATerrace</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Rotherham United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> What else could it be? We're going home at last! Don Valley Stadium was a means to an end, and it allowed the club to continue, but it's good to be back in our own stadium. The New York stadium looks truly stunning and it will hopefully be a joy to watch games there. Just as long as we don't run out to the Sinatra song. On the pitch, it's been another summer of upheaval with 10 new signings at the time of writing. I still don't like the fact that we have Steve Evans as our manager but he appears to have made some good signings if pre-season reports are to be believed. As long as we don't become reliant on a single goalscorer as we have the last couple of years, we should have a good shot at promotion.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> Probably the same as fans of most teams \u2013 some decent, attacking, passing football in a stadium with atmosphere.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> We'll certainly have an atmosphere to watch games in. DVS was renowned for being soulless. As for the football, if we can't be optimistic now when can we be? We've signed some pacey players as well as some who can keep the ball which bodes well for the style of football, though we do need to remember it's still League Two. The return of Ian Sharps should help strengthen the defence significantly.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> The youth system has been neglected in the last few years. Whether he makes the breakthrough this year is unclear, but good things are being said about Mitchell Rose. Of the new signings, I'm looking forward to watching our new Icelandic international, Kari Arnason.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish ...</strong> Top three. Hopefully we'll win the title, but as long as we go up I don't really mind.</p> <p><strong>Phil Kyte, London Miller</strong></p> <h2>Southend United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Having missed out on automatic promotion due to below-par home form and an unusually high points total for a top three place, Paul Sturrock has shaken up his squad for this season. Having lost Anthony Grant to Stevenage, Southend released around 12 players this summer including Liam Dickinson, whilst Bilel Mohsni created his own transfer saga having decided to leave Roots Hall. Sturrock has signed shrewdly in opting for proven League Two talent, having brought in Ryan Cresswell, Anthony Straker, Kevan Hurst, Gavin Tomlin and, of course, sealing the permanent return of local messiah Freddy Eastwood. However, with just a few days to go, Southend still haven't got a goalkeeper \u2013 a strategy that will surely overtake tika-taka as the in vogue footballing style this season!</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>After last season's agonising conclusion, Southend fans will be hoping for nothing but promotion in 2013. The fans hope that if Freddy Eastwood gets fit, stays fit and returns to the form of his first spell at Southend, automatic promotion is a genuine possibility.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A top seven finish appears most likely again this season. There is stiff competition yet again for the automatic places as League Two boasts two more big-spending teams in Fleetwood and Rotherham looking to match Swindon and Crawley's efforts last year. The management team will be particularly keen to avoid the play-offs again but may have to settle for that.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>After missing all of 2011-12 through injury, the almost-forgotten man Barry Corr could return to strike fear into League Two defenders this season and replicate the 21 goals he scored during the 2010-11 season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Play-offs minimum. Southend will at least match last season's efforts and will hope to better it, but significantly improved fortune in the play-offs will do just fine.</p> <p><strong>Lew Carey, </strong><a href=\"http://lewcarey.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Another Northern Sky </strong></a></p> <h2>Torquay United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Just like this time last year we're having to deal with losing three of the previous season's outstanding performers. The formidable Bobby Olejnik's goalkeeping talents were wasted in League Two, while the bright young pair of centre-back Mark Ellis and midfield string-puller Eunan O'Kane also impressed sufficiently to justify testing themselves at a higher level. Plenty of talent remains however and Martin Ling looks to have done a respectable job of sourcing replacements, particularly the lively forward Billy Bodin who impressed on loan last season and should be capable of replicating O'Kane's attacking invention, although we still arguably lack depth in several areas.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Most \u2013 myself included \u2013 will be hoping for a third consecutive play-off campaign. Even if our new signings don't sparkle to the same extent as their predecessors the continuity, momentum and harmony carried over from last season \u2013 plus the remaining funds from our summer player sales \u2013 should provide a solid platform.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Something not altogether dissimilar provided that Martin Ling heeds the lessons of last season, where insufficient squad rotation and an over-reliance on defensive heroics saw us stutter towards the finish. Another inconsistent start or the loss of a key player to injury could well see us slip towards mid-table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>The manager has challenged exciting young winger Saul Halpin to fulfil his obvious potential. Tall for his position and with a flair for the unexpected, he has the ability to terrify unsuspecting full-backs.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Almost certainly in the top half. I was unduly pessimistic last season, so this time I'll throw caution to the wind and go for sixth place.</p> <p><strong>Ben Mayhew, </strong><a href=\"http://greenwichgull.wordpress.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Greenwich Gull </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a href=\"http://experimental361.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>experimental361.com</strong></a></p> <h2>Wycombe Wanderers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> With relegation back to League Two officially confirming Wanderers as a 'yo-yo' club, by far the biggest story of the summer has been the takeover of the club by the Supporters Trust. The takeover has come eight years after a new dawn had been promised by the then board of directors, who bullied through a conversion to a plc and thus ended one of the last remaining supporter-owned clubs in the Football League. The last three of those eight years has seen Wanderers run by a single owner who racked up debts of more than \u00a36m in the form of loans. The task of the Trust is to now get the club back on an even keel. A transfer embargo placed on the club for the non-filing of accounts, was only lifted following the Trust takeover at the end of June. Manager Gary Waddock promptly made six signings to replace a similar amount released at the end of the 2011-12 campaign. Perhaps the most familiar of those signed will be former Luton Town midfielder Matt Spring. Meanwhile, the future of top scorer Stuart Beavon at the club is still uncertain. He bagged 25 goals last season but with his contract running until June 2013, is expected to leave, either before the season starts or in the January transfer window. Beavon's form or replacement will be crucial in Wanderers aspirations for the new season in League Two.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> In an ideal world, the Trust takeover would prompt a return in local interest for the club and that spirit would lift the team to automatic promotion back to League One. Playing in a league lower than last season, should make that a possibility.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> With the Trust trying to cut losses of in excess of \u00a31m per season, there will be little room for error if the new signings don't gel. Expensive loan signings, that have become almost obligatory in the second half of the season, may not be an option and fans may just have to settle for also rans in the promotion chasers.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> With the Trust taking the bold step of scrapping the club's \u00a3600,000 loss making youth system, it's perhaps poignant that it's worth looking out for a couple of names that come though that system \u2013 midfielder Josh Scowen and defender Jesse Kewley-Graham.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>A wildly optimistic sixth but edged out in the play-offs.</p> <p><strong>Paul Lewis, </strong><a href=\"http://www.chairboys.ndirect.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Chairboys.co.uk </strong></a></p> <h2>York City</h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> After the elation of finally getting promotion back to the Football League this summer has been about subtle improvements rather than the wholesale changes of the last few seasons. With the bulk of the squad signed up for another year and the odd fresh face, the only real disappointment is the loss of left-back James Meredith, one of the key players over the last few campaigns. The failure to land an extra striker is a worry, making Jason Walker's fitness and form essential to a successful season.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> After tasting success in our two trips to Wembley last year the fans will be hoping to challenge in the play-offs again. The annual pilgrimage to the national stadium maybe a bit harder to achieve this year but a good cup run will appease the fans.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> Our brand of football relies heavily on the conditions being right, meaning we will start and end the season well, but will struggle when the pitches are heavy in the winter. We have a good and quick attack but look suspect at the back.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> After signing from Darlington in the summer, John McReedy has excited fans in pre-season with his quick feet and intelligent play, despite still being quite raw he will develop as the season progresses and could prove to be the difference maker in tight contests.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish\u2026</strong> Mid-table. If I was being bold I'd say 10th.</p> <p><strong>Shaun Wathey, York fan</strong></p>",
  "<p>As part of the investment in security surrounding the Olympics in London, the Health Protection Agency has been touting a state-of-the-art disease surveillance system promising real-time collection and analysis of health-related data to detect threats as early as possible. It tracks flu symptoms, rashes, vomiting, double vision, and other symptoms of infectious diseases.</p> <p>The effort is laudable, and it makes good sense for an event as big as the Games.</p> <p>But, when the Olympics are over, a more powerful and effective way of protecting the public from imminent health threats would be to apply that same innovative spirit and computational power to preventable chronic diseases and their associated risk factors. Heart disease, cholesterol, high blood pressure and obesity kill more people every day than infectious diseases.</p> <p>This is partly a political reality. If five children die from meningitis during the London Olympics, the government would be attacked by the media, and officials would lose their jobs. Unfortunately, the roughly 250 heart attacks that will occur every day in England during the Olympics will cause no alarm at all.</p> <p>In the US, a third of the 2.4m deaths annually are due to just two causes: heart disease and stroke. Yet there is no outcry. But after a handful of cases of whooping cough nationwide, agencies coast to coast mobilised against it. But this is changing.</p> <p>More than a century ago, New York had this same infectious-disease mindset, but when cholera threatened to kill and maim in 1866, inspectors from the newly created metropolitan health department went door to door collecting people's clothes and burning them. They disinfected bathrooms, kitchens, and bedrooms. It worked; fatalities from cholera dropped 90% from the previous epidemic in 1849.</p> <p>New York now leads the way in public health in fighting chronic diseases, with smoking bans, cooking oil restrictions, calorie counts on menus, and restrictions on the amount of soda that can be sold. We can debate the relative effectiveness of different policies, but the overall campaign is a winner: engage the community in a discussion of the importance of healthy behaviours, put policies in place that encourage those behaviours, and measure the impact of those policies.</p> <p>And look what has happened to life expectancy: the average for men increased by 13.6 years between 1989 and 2009, the biggest improvement in the country. For women, the gain was 7.2 years, also the best. A big part of these gains is due to the successful control of infectious diseases, and especially HIV/Aids. But the public health approach to chronic disease is an important component that should be a model for other agencies worldwide.</p> <h2><strong>This requires three steps</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 Build consensus before going bold. If a city had tried to ban supersized sodas two decades ago, protesters would have flooded the streets with signs saying: \"No taxation without carbonation!\" New York leaders prepared their audience by showing them the damage being done by runaway calorie consumption.</p> <p>\u2022 Prove the concept. Cities and states followed New York's lead in requiring calorie counts on menus. Studies have subsequently shown that when people read the calorie information, they generally choose lower-calorie items.</p> <p>\u2022 Utilise your assets. One of the most exciting things about the infectious disease surveillance program launched in the UK is its use of aggregated data from physician visits by millions of patients. This is a big institutional and cultural leap from just a decade ago when governments were slow to detect and respond to Sars.</p> <p>To track chronic diseases, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington is piloting a project working with the Seattle and King County health department that merges data sources from hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. The main objective is to determine the causes of disparities in outcomes and to better develop programmes to control chronic diseases. We hope other cities, states, and countries follow suit to find the health disparities in their communities and address them.</p> <p>Chronic diseases deserve the same attention as infectious diseases. Both are equally important and should be approached with the same vigour and high-tech innovation.</p> <p><em>Ali Mokdad is professor of global health at the</em><a href=\"http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/about-ihme\" title=\"\"><em> Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</em></a><em> (IHME) at the University of Washington and leads the survey and surveillance activities at the Institute</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

  "<p>It's the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/sports/athletics/events/mens-marathon\">men's marathon</a> on Sunday, the final event of the Olympics, and you don't need a ticket to attend. Choose your route-side point <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athletics/event=athletics-men-marathon/coursemap/\">here</a>, but spare a thought for the East End. </p> <p>Olympic marathons traditionally end inside the main games stadium. Had that tradition been maintained for London 2012, the hard-up host borough of Tower Hamlets would have hosted a major event, its residents could have lined its streets and enjoyed it for free, and a global TV audience would have seen and maybe learned a little about some of the capital's most important but not very glamorous historical sites. </p> <p>When Locog declared in autumn 2010 that the course would be through tourist-attractive central London instead it felt like a snub to the very part of the city the Games is supposed to help most.

  "<p>It's been a big year so far for British brands. With the Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics, many marketers have focused their campaigns on patriotism and building on the tangible energy and excitement. It's hard to find an advertisement or promotion where the product is not tied (however tenuously) to the event, from tablets at the opening ceremony to synchronised swimming in broadband packages.</p> <p>But once the dust settles towards the middle of September, brands are going to be looking at what's next for their marketing campaigns. This means agencies need to start preparing now and they need to learn fast. Those agencies that are geared up and move quickly will have an advantage over their competitors.</p> <p>The majority of the 5,000 marketing directors we interviewed in Q1 and Q2 of 2012 said they were waiting for the Jubilee and Olympic periods to be over before launching major initiatives, and there are many reasons for this.</p> <p>Companies that did not secure sponsorship opportunities have been reluctant to launch major campaigns in a period where there is so much noise created by the sponsors that their messages to consumers are in danger of being drowned out. Many have decided to wait and see which messages and campaigns work throughout the Games so that they will be able to adjust their strategies accordingly.</p> <p>For Olympic sponsors the experience has been different. Firstly, while sponsorship represents an unparalleled opportunity to boost their profiles and get in front of consumers, it is not all plain sailing, and they have to face some of the negative publicity that comes with the territory. A classic example is the backlash against McDonald's, which was recently accused of having a monopoly over chips in the Olympic Village.</p> <p>A further pitfall of being an Olympic sponsor is the potential for hijacking and many non-Olympic brands are already pushing the limits of what's allowed. It has also opened the door to criticism for some sponsors like Coca-Cola and Cadburys, who are all accused of promoting unhealthy foods on a global platform.</p> <p>Social media has been privy to a lot of this negative sentiment, so agencies will need to be aware that it may be a delicate subject for many brands, and adapt their standard social media pitch to reflect this.</p> <p>Sponsors will be closely monitoring the returns on their substantial investments come the autumn, with particular focus on social media. At the time of the Beijing Olympics, Twitter had barely a million users, and Facebook was only a fifth of its current size. Most brands are still developing their social strategies and they are going to be very interested in the potential impact of social networks on their reputations this August. In fact, the entire business world will be watching social networks closely, and in addition to the obvious need for messaging refreshes (as the sports analogies and medal metaphors will simply no longer be relevant) there will no doubt be major online overhauls in the autumn as well.</p> <p>Another unexpected turn of events that affected sponsors in the past weeks was the fantastic achievement of Bradley Wiggins in the Tour de France. Few marketing departments would have predicted two years ago when they signed their sponsorship deals that another sporting event just a week before the Games could threaten to steal their thunder. But, to the delight of the British population (and BSkyB \u2014 not an Olympic sponsor), Wiggins did just that \u2013 an enormous achievement.</p> <p>For brands associated with the Olympics, the challenge will be how they can be repositioned. Will the current advertising focus on British heritage and patriotism be something they want to maintain, or will they go back to being more reserved in a typical 'British' manner? Perhaps the British hype may be seen as 'tacky' after the Games, or maybe this heightened sense of pride is part of the legacy. The most likely scenario, assuming the Games will be deemed a success, is that organisations will run two campaigns in parallel: national 'proud British' campaigns and international ones, capitalising on the success of the events.</p> <p>At the same time, all the CSR and well being initiatives that have been launched in the run-up to the Games will need to be maintained, to ensure consistency of brand image, and so that sponsors can use the legacy in their campaigns for years to come. Companies neglect these at their peril, as the media will be keen on annual legacy reviews for at least the next ten Augusts.</p> <p>Referring to the Olympics opening ceremony, Danny Boyle said he hoped it would reflect a country trying to \"find its level\" in the world. He mentioned how it needed to portray a 'modesty', and the show has been described as warm, witty and self-deprecating in a true British sense. Brands will now also be thinking about how to find their 'level' in the world, and will be looking to articulate a different notion of Britishness that resonates globally.</p> <p>The message to suppliers in the marketing, advertising and communications industries is clear: come September, you will be expected to act quickly, analyse the impact of this unusual summer on the media industry and Brand Britain, and provide advice in uncharted territory as calls for an encore to the greatest show on Earth resound.</p> <p><em>Anthony Cooper is managing director of business intelligence company </em><a href=\"http://pearlfinders.com\" title=\"\"><em>Pearlfinders</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Africa once was an important exporter of raw peanuts. In the 1960s, the continent accounted for about 75% of the global trade; by 2005, that had figure had slumped to just 5%. Increased competition from America, Argentina and particularly China was part of the story. But <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/aflatoxins_en.htm\" title=\"\">stricter food safety controls from Europe</a> also took their toll. In particular, European countries placed strict limits on the level of <a href=\"http://www.icrisat.org/aflatoxin/food_security.asp\" title=\"\">aflatoxins</a> \u2013 a type of mycotoxin fungi \u2013 in peanuts, hitting countries such as Malawi.</p> <p>Aflatoxins are a naturally occurring but highly toxic substance caused by fungi that grow on crops such as maize, paprika and peanuts (more commonly referred to as groundnuts in Africa). Contaminations can happen as a result of poor pre- and post-harvest practices, such as inadequate drying and storage. Poor-quality kernels \u2013 immature, shrivelled or damaged \u2013 are prone to contamination by aflatoxins.</p> <p>There have been several reported cases of acute aflatoxicosis \u2013 where extremely high doses of aflatoxin have been ingested \u2013 associated with the consumption of contaminated homegrown maize. There were two outbreaks in Kenya \u2013 one in 1982, in which 12 people died, and one in 2004, in which 317 people became ill and 125 people died.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/topics/Mycotoxins/Pages/EconomicImpact.aspx\" title=\"\">The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that 25% of the world's crops</a> are affected by mycotoxins, leading to chronic exposure for about 4.5 billion people, mainly in the tropics and subtropics.</p> <p>The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organisation estimate that approximately 80% of liver cancers \u2013 which are far more prevalent in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of the developing world \u2013 are related to aflatoxin consumption. Aflatoxins are also linked to increased susceptibility to maternal anaemia and childhood stunting. In west Africa, stunted or underweight children have aflatoxin levels that are 30% to 40% higher than in children of normal height and weight.</p> <p>Studies conducted by the <a href=\"http://www.icrisat.org/\" title=\"\">International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics</a> (Icrisat) in southern India revealed aflatoxin levels as high as 40 times the permissible limit. Both groundnut haulms (crop residue) and cake made from crushed seeds are major sources of animal feed. This can lead to the contamination of milk in both urban and rural areas, potentially exposing a huge cross-section of the population, particularly children, to the effects of aflatoxins.</p> <p>Yet food safety, according to <a href=\"http://www.twin.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Twin</a>, a fair trade NGO, is neglected and should be firmly on the development agenda, particularly at a time when David Cameron is co-chairing the UN committee that will look at the post-2015 development agenda and leading the 2013 G8 meetings that will address food security and nutrition. The UK prime minister is also chairing the hunger summit on Sunday, making the most of the presence of world leaders at the Olympics closing ceremony.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.twin.org.uk/projects/afri-nut-ltd-landmark-groundnut-processing-plant-malawi\" title=\"\">Twin is currently working on food safety and food security in Malawi, focusing on groundnuts</a>, but with wider implications for key staple crops such as maize. Malawi once had significant groundnut exports (up to 40,000 metric tonnes a year), but volumes have now dropped severely following the implementation of rigorous food safety standards in Europe. Twin's work in Malawi initially focused on improving the safety of groundnuts for the international market. As it learned more about aflatoxin contamination, however, its focus switched to making food safe for the domestic population.</p> <p>\"Concentrating on food security and nutrition are not enough,\" said Andrew Emmott, senior nut manager at Twin. \"Nutrition is seen as a silver bullet, but, unless you look at the full range of issues including food safety, you've got a problem. Keeping contaminated food from being exported to Europe does not mean that you are keeping unsafe food out of the local population in Malawi.\"</p> <p>Twin says 60% of groundnuts grown in Malawi are traded informally and consumed locally, and are not subject to any testing for aflatoxin. The same applies to trading and consumption of staples such as maize. Techniques for preventing contamination can be relatively simple. Groundnuts that are allowed to dry well immediately after harvesting tend to develop negligible levels of contamination, whereas groundnuts left out but covered with haulms and leaves tend to develop high levels of aflatoxin contamination. The most effective means of control is immediate removal of pods from harvested plants, but this is not always possible at a time when other farm activities are at their peak, so one possible option is the use of cheap dryers.</p> <p>Donors have not entirely neglected aflatoxins. The <a href=\"http://www.merid.org/aflatoxinpartnership/Press_Release.aspx\" title=\"\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK's Department for International Development announced funding of $19.8m and $1.6m, respectively, in February</a> to support the Partnership for aflatoxin control in Africa to look at solutions such as proper drying and storage.</p>",

  "<p>I first started working on London 2012-inspired arts projects back in 2008 and since then have been privileged to have been part of the Cultural Olympiad in myriad forms. I have worked across all genres; brought sports and science together with the arts; involved over 200 artists and participants of all ages and backgrounds (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/team-gb\" title=\"\">including some of Team GB</a>); and reached an audience of over half a million in the south-east alone.</p> <p>From where I'm sitting, knowing this has been replicated UK-wide, the Cultural Olympiad can be viewed as a massive success. But during this whole experience, I've found myself having to justify this sports-initiated endeavour to many of my colleagues in the culture sector.</p> <p>Interrogation was fiercest from those who resented the changed funding landscape: why was money being diverted from arts to sport? Those who saw no reason for dialogue between the two asked me to defend the creative collaboration. And to those who viewed the Olympics as elitist, I've have had to attest to the fact that they \u2013 or at least the Cultural Olympiad \u2013 were inclusive.</p> <p>Of course, I was also in the fortunate position of telling artists I had money to give them for new 'arts-sports' commissions. Some responded with works directly linked to sports or London 2012, others created more tangential or abstract work. Either was fine by me. I viewed London 2012 as a cultural moment that demanded the critical engagement of the arts \u2013 this was my motivation to work in and around the Olympics from the off.</p> <p>That's not to say my journey to Games time has been easy. I have worked with consummate professionals at every turn but I've also sat in meetings with six departments vying for authority. I have waited so long for press releases that the news moment has long gone and with it the opportunity to celebrate the arts. I have been asked to make the near-impossible happen after months spent waiting for a brief or a key decision to be made. I have been forced to play dictator to people trying simply to understand the rules behind the branding and creative rights. And I have looked for leadership, foresight and clarity and often found it lacking.</p> <p>Then again, none of us had ever put on an Olympics before, let along one that was reaching out beyond sports to culture. It was bound to be a working environment of thinking on the spot.</p> <p>One very real fear I had was the culture of privilege I encountered \u2013 that this might be the Olympic legacy the arts were left with. Numerous times I was told that artists should be biting their London 2012-branded arms off to be included. Numerous times an artist's daily rate was quoted below the market rate. Numerous times artists were expected to fund their own travel, accommodation and materials. Too often, the cost to artists for seizing this opportunity seemed to financial and moral loss.</p> <p>Would this way of working become the norm post-Games: a culture that did not remunerate the arts, that saw it as the poor and subservient relation to sport? But the opening ceremony and the strength of the Cultural Olympiad at large should put pay to any doubts over parity of status. And with the likes of a-n, Air and the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/may/16/artists-finance-statistics-career-problems\" title=\"\">all bringing artists' rates to the fore</a>, I hope I never have to fight the corner of an artist to be paid properly again.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01f87nh\" title=\"\">We've all seen TwentyTwelve</a>, so I'm sure I don't need to labour these points. Nor do I want to. We got there in the end. Jubilant at the superb show UK arts has put on for the wider world, I end my Olympic journey as I began it, believing in art's ability both to applaud and hold to account sporting endeavour, values and politics. To document, explore and challenge what the Games means to this country as well as be part of its collective celebration.</p> <p>My true ambition when starting out with the Games in 2008 was that the Cultural Olympiad would quieten its own naysayers come 2012. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/poll/2012/jul/30/london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony-arts-culture\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle's opening ceremony was a calling card</a>: fun, vibrant, provocative, subversive and high calibre. It encapsulated in one night all the London 2012 inspired projects I have been involved in. It felt like the arts had won the first gold of the Games and, to me at least, that the Cultural Olympiad had been vindicated.</p> <p>None of that ceremony could have been delivered, on or off stage, without the prior generation of arts investment this country has enjoyed. Not only did it mark the start of the Games, it celebrated the depth, breadth and quality of the UK cultural community and sector. A community that has been under sustained stress in recent years, an easy target for austerity economics.</p> <p>Beyond the spectacle of the ceremony, I hope audiences have been left in awe and support of our arts and that as a sector we have used the opportunity London 2012 afforded us to make our mark anew. We have invigorated existing and forged new connections, proving our value to those outside our immediate remit. Let's move forward into (still) uncertain times sure of that value ourselves.</p> <p><em>Editor's note: And we still have the Paralympics to go.

  "<p>Local authorities are awash with new financial freedoms. Councils recently took charge of their own housing stock and the associated rental income. The local government finance bill, working its way through parliament, will provide a direct link between local business rate growth and local authority finances. Controversial plans are under way to localise council tax support. With power being devolved in so many areas, why are ministers still reluctant to do the same with planning fees?</p> <p>In November 2010 the government consulted on allowing councils to set their own planning application fees. Since then, nothing has been heard on the matter \u2013 at least on the government's side. Planners have been calling for the introduction of local fees ever since, while growing increasing fearful that the plans have been dropped at the centre. Their fears appeared to be confirmed in July when decentralisation minister Greg Clark announced fees would be increased by 15% across the board, in line with inflation.</p> <p>Malcolm Sharp, president of the Planning Officers Society, says the announced increase is far from the solution that was hoped for. \"Planning is being asked by the government to step up to the mark. We're all willing and ready to do that but if we're really going to do this effectively we need the resources. This is just going to help us keep the show on the road.\"</p> <p>Recent planning reforms have introduced new responsibilities such as the requirement to submit applications for design review. Some local authority areas are inherently more complex for planning teams, meaning the application process is much more resource intensive. Councils are adamant that they must be allowed to recoup the true cost of dealing with applications from developers.</p> <p>The evidence also suggests that developers are prepared to cover this cost. Last year, fed up with waiting for local fees to be introduced, Westminster city council struck a voluntary deal with Westminster Property Association. The group, which represents major developers in London's West End, agreed to contribute an extra \u00a326,000 for major projects in return for guarantees over the time taken to process the application.</p> <p>Despite the success of this arrangement, ministers have declined to formally extend the deal elsewhere. John Walker, operational director of development planning at Westminster, is unimpressed. \"It's a fob off,\" he says of the 15% increase.</p> <p>Walker believes ministers are concerned about introducing a policy which could result in increased fees and be seen as a brake on the economy. \"It's only cost recovery, which I don't think is unreasonable,\" he says, pointing out that the money has to be found somewhere. \"Why should the taxpayer be subsidising someone who's carrying out a major development?\"</p> <p>It wouldn't be the first time that planning policies have borne the hallmark of Treasury intervention. Sharp agrees that fears about the impact on economic growth played a part in the decision. \"I can only think that the government feels local fees would have some dampening effect on development,\" he says.</p> <p>Conversely, some suggest a uniform approach to fee setting could actually stifle development. Kate Henderson, chief executive of the Town and Country Planning Association, says pro-development councils may be hindered by the enforced 15% fee hike, which could add to the financial pressure on developers. \"A blanket national increase may have implications for areas that are struggling with viability,\" she says. \"In areas where there are more challenging sites, this may have an adverse impact.\"</p> <p>In Westminster, Walker says feedback from developers on voluntary fee contributions has been positive and he is hopeful the council's deal will be renewed in October. He recommends others councils discuss similar proposals with local developers. Provided with guarantees over the quality of the service, many applicants will be prepared to stump up the extra cash.</p> <p>For now, a more formal arrangement looks unlikely to be forthcoming. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government claimed: \"The government has balanced the need to ensure councils are properly resourced to assess planning applications, while reducing the burden on ordinary council taxpayers. These measures will enable councils to provide an efficient planning service and support the delivery of development and regeneration.\"</p> <p>If ministers think the matter is dealt with, others remain unconvinced. \"We will continue to press for an even fairer, more transparent, localised system for planning fees,\" says Clyde Loakes, vice-chair of the Local Government Association's environment and housing board.</p> <p>It was four years ago that planning fees were last reviewed. It seems unlikely councils will put up with the lack of flexibility for that long again.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more news, views and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Last year, the people of Wales <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cardiff/2011/mar/04/welsh-assembly-referendum-counting-begins\" title=\"\">voted for the National Assembly for Wales to have primary law-making powers</a>. Today, in 20 fields such as health, education, local government and the environment, the national assembly has the authority to legislate without Westminster. The executive itself is now separate from the assembly and shortly after the referendum rebranded itself the Welsh government. So today, I am calling on the National Assembly for Wales to be renamed the Welsh parliament.</p> <p>In this, the week of the <a href=\"http://www.eisteddfod.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Eisteddfod</a>, the most important Welsh cultural event in the calendar, I feel it is now time to have a Welsh parliament. Polling and the recent referendum show that the electorate want an institution as strong as a parliament, and in reality the national assembly is in all but name the Welsh parliament.</p> <p>Many may question why I as a proud unionist would call for such a move. I have never shied away from the fact that I believe the United Kingdom has been a force for good, where we have a richer and fairer society because we are united. Where the UK allows us a much bigger presence on the world stage, where as we have seen with the Olympics, the UK has so much to offer the world as a union. But, by the same measure, I and many in the Welsh Conservatives are proud to be Welsh. We are proud of our culture, language and heritage, and as a party are proud of devolution.</p> <p>There can be no doubt too, that uncertainty with the Scottish referendum is having repercussions in Wales. Some in Wales do want to break away and go it alone. A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/01/wales-drumbeat-devolution\" title=\"\">recent poll</a>, however, showed that only 7% of people in Wales do want to separate. I believe that the United Kingdom gives us strength as a community. When any part of the United Kingdom suffers a setback, the rest of the country stands behind it. From severe weather to economic setbacks, there is a community within our union that goes beyond the political to the emotional. It is because of strength of the UK that I believe now is the time to have a strong Welsh parliament in a strong United Kingdom.</p> <p>So why now? Why change a name from assembly to parliament?</p> <p>This isn't simply a rebrand for the sake of rebranding; this is a statement about the institution that now legislates for our great nation. The assembly deserves to be respected. It deserves the respect of the executive, and it deserves to be an institution that stands out. Some may question why there needs to be any change at all. There is a parliament in Scotland with primary law-making powers, so why not in Wales?</p> <p>For years, confusion has understandably existed among the Welsh public in distinguishing between the Welsh assembly government and the National Assembly for Wales. The rebranding of WAG to Welsh government' has helped mitigate that, but we believe the time has come for Wales's devolved institution to lose the \"assembly\" tag and brand itself as a proper Welsh parliament \u2013 strengthening the distinction between legislature and executive, while giving it the accolade the people of Wales afforded it in last year's referendum.</p> <p>The process for this to happen is very simple. One small amendment to the Government of Wales Act 2006 would be all that needs to happen to change the National Assembly for Wales into the Welsh parliament. No expensive rebrand, no new buildings, no more politicians, no new protocol, but what a statement it would be!</p> <p>A statement that shows that Wales is a nation with a strong legislature in a strong United Kingdom.</p> <p>When we look at other countries such as Australia, state parliaments operate alongside the national parliament. In the UK, we have the Scottish parliament and the Westminster parliament. There is no reason why we couldn't have the Welsh parliament, too.</p> <p>So in this week of celebration of Welsh culture, I call on other leaders to consider this change. There is no hurry to overnight changes, but in 2016 wouldn't it be a great thing for the Welsh people to vote in elections for a Welsh parliament for the first time since the 15th century.</p> <p>Some may say that this is just a name change, but I say that there is a lot in a name.</p>",
  "<p>My wife is a successful research fellow. She is a world class researcher and has a strong publication record. She is a talented lecturer and is respected by her students. She collaborates with academic and industrial partners and is invited regularly to speak at conferences around the world. But when her funding runs out this October, the Russell Group university where she has worked for the last eight years is making her redundant. She is struggling to find another position. And it is my fault.</p> <p>We call it the 'two body' problem, after the scenario in physics when a pair of particles interacts with each other. In our case, though, it comes about when the demands of an academic career collide brutally with the obligations of being but one half of a couple, with owning a home and with generally having a life. But while physicists can solve their two body problems with a few deft equations, the real life equivalent is significantly less tractable.</p> <p>We have managed to cope reasonably well so far. I was happy to adopt the role of 'trailing spouse' so that my wife could develop her career. So when we stayed with her parents while she wrote up her doctoral thesis, I got a temporary job nearby. When she secured her first postdoctoral position at Warwick, I found a respectable graduate job down the road in Birmingham. And when she moved down to Bristol, I put in for a transfer to my employer's office in the city.</p> <p>But this time things are different. I now run my own successful business and have developed strong ties to the area. I like our house, I like our garden and I like where we live. Moving somewhere new and starting again from scratch is really not a tempting option. So when my wife speaks of <a href=\"http://highereducationjobs.guardian.co.uk/\">jobs</a> in Manchester, Munich or Mississippi, I really want to be supportive. But deep down I just don't want to go. And, if we are being honest, neither does she.</p> <p>My wife's colleagues seem less than sympathetic to our plight. 'Just go anyway', was the response from one. Another was presumably 'only trying to help' when he forwarded her details of positions in the United States. I don't know whether it is because my wife's fellow academics are mostly male, because they already have permanent posts or because they are not used to a two-career family, but I find their presumptions that she can simply pack her bags and move to another city, country or even continent particularly disturbing.</p> <p>We cannot be the only couple in this position, forced to compromise the career of one so that the other may flourish. I can see that working in different research environments and with people from different backgrounds is a positive thing, but why does nobody seem to notice that having to postdoc in several countries before anyone will even consider you for a permanent lectureship \u2013 should such a thing even still exist in the current environment \u2013 is just not compatible with how most people want to live?</p> <p>I have read in recent weeks a number of articles criticising the lack of diversity among academics and lamenting the 'leaky pipe' of, in particular, female researchers who complete a PhD or a first postdoctoral position only to then leave academia for something else. While it is unlikely to be the only cause, the two body problem must surely constitute a significant barrier to aspiring academics with a working spouse, children, caring responsibilities or any of the myriad other obligations that we take inexorably upon ourselves as we got through life.</p> <p>In our house, meanwhile, things are looking bleak. While my wife is keeping her fingers crossed for an academic post in our neck of the woods, she is starting to look at alternative career options. I am confident that she will be brilliant at anything to which she decides to turn her hand, but I cannot help but be angry that we have to be in this position in the first place. And while I am willing to accept some of the responsibility for our predicament, I think it is only right that the sector itself shoulders its share of the blame, too.</p> <p><em>Simon Perks is a writer and consultant based in Bristol, UK \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/simonperks\" title=\"\"><em>@simonperks</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Manchester United have slashed the price of their shares ahead of their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p> <p>The club had been set to sell their shares for between $16-$20 (\u00a310.20-\u00a312.80) a share but cut them to $14 late on Thursday following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May.</p> <p>Even after the cut United will be valued at $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) making them the most valuable football club in the world. Real Madrid, their closest rivals in financial terms, are valued at $1.88bn, according to an annual ranking by Forbes magazine.</p> <p>The shares are being sold by the Glazer family, a US-family who made their fortune with shopping malls and trailer parks and also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p> <p>The Glazers bought United in 2005 for about \u00a3800m. They are selling 16.7m shares, equal to a 10% stake, and will raise about $330m. The family will net about about \u00a390m from the flotation.</p> <p>The club claim a global fan base of about 660m and have won a record 19 league titles. Their share sale will be the largest sports listing on record, surpassing World Wrestling Federation's $190m IPO in 1999, according to Thomson Reuters.</p> <p>It will also be the most high-profile since Facebook's ill-fated debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May. The social network's much hyped share sale proved a bust and shares initially sold at $38 are now worth $20.</p> <p>Wall Street analysts have warned they believe United's sale too could be a disappointment. \"I'm calling this son of Facebook,\" said David Menlow, president of the research firm IPOfinancial.com.</p> <p>He said too little of the money being raised looked like it was going to be invested in the club, the club had too many debts and it was not clear how they intended to grow as a business.</p> <p>\"Sports franchises have this emotional flourish, then everybody wakes up and wonders, 'Do I really want to own this?'\" he said.</p> <p>Sam Hamadeh, founder New York-based analyst PrivCo, called United \"a collectible not an investment\". \"This is one for the rabid fan,\" he said.</p> <p>This is the Glazer family's third attempt at a share sale having previously scrapped efforts to sell shares on exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p> <p>Those sales failed as investors balked at United's proposed dual class share structure. Under the US listing the family will retain control of the club through class B shares that have 10 times more voting power than the publicly traded class A shares.</p> <p>The company is also taking advantage of recently introduced US laws that limit the financial disclosures it must make. United is raising capital as an \"emerging growth\" company under president Barack Obama's recently passed Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or Jobs Act.</p> <p>The move means United will not be required to file quarterly reports or be subject to the same level of financial scrutiny as other US-listed firms for five years.</p> <p>Some of the proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to pay down some of the 134-year-old club's debt, which was last reported to be around \u00a3423m. But the Glazer family had originally claimed all the proceeds would go towards United's debt, angering some fans.</p> <p>A leading fans group has called for a boycott of the club's sponsors in protest at the terms of the share sale.</p> <p>A statement from the Manchester United Supporters Trust (Must) read: \"The Manchester United Supporters Trust has today called for a worldwide boycott of Manchester United sponsors' products, with support across the UK, Europe, Asia and the US. The boycott strategy is intended to send a loud and clear message to the Glazer family and club sponsors that, without the support and purchasing power of the fans, the global strength of the Manchester United brand doesn't actually exist.\"</p>",
  "<p>Here's another side of the grouse moor issue, which was the subject of today's first <em>Guardian Northerner</em> post: environmental campaigners are holding a protest walk this Sunday, 12 August, before launching a national discussion on the management of blanket bogs.</p> <p>The issue comes close to home for many of those who will take part in the event at Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, a town which has made regular national headlines this summer because of its <a href=\"http://www.hebdenbridge.co.uk/\">devastation by floods</a>. Damage and bog treatment are linked because of the effects of drainage and moorland 'tidying' including burning; some of the worst effects of the second flood were caused by run-off sweeping down from the surrounding hills.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394497020\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/7/29/1280420724518/A-shooter-watches-a-grous-002.jpg\" alt=\"A shooter watches a grouse\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hunter: Shooting starts on the 13th this year as the law forbids the hunting of game birds on Sundays and Christmas Day.

This<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/14/natural-england-peatland-bog-burning\"> (map on link) ended a planned public inquiry</a> and prosecution of the estate for 43 alleged breaches of environmental management of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. </p> <p>Natural England and moorland owners defend the agreement as a way of safeguarding bogs while allowing conservation of the heather which is essential for the birds to flourish. Natural England and the estate say that the stewardship:</p> <blockquote> <p>ends earlier, imprecise and unlimited consents in favour of an agreement that operates for a defined period of time - 25 years - and that specifies agreed limits on the scale of management activities and provides greater opportunity for habitat conservation and recovery. For the first time, burning activities will be subject to specific controls. </p> </blockquote> <p>The moor debate and the floods have prompted a decision to go further and set up a <a href=\"http://www.energyroyd.org.uk/archives/tag/ban-the-burn\">Ban the Burn campaign</a> nationally, which will be launched at Hebden Bridge Trades Club after the walk (which looks like being blessed by fair weather, according to forecasts). This intends to highlight four issues raised by schemes like the Walshaw Moor stewardship, which has exemptions to the Heather and Grass Burning Code incorporated allowing burning on the moors areas of blanket bog. Ban the Burn will emphasise:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>- increased flood risk downstream<br>- very significant carbon emissions<br>- adverse impacts on water quality<br>- the destruction of a globally significant habitat type</p> </blockquote> <p>Dongria Kondh, one of the walkers, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Here in Hebden Bridge we know the real hardship of flooding \u2013 shops and businesses in our town are still shut, and many of our friends and neighbours have suffered irreplaceable loss.&#xa0; In order to reduce our town's vulnerability to flooding, we need the upland catchment to be managed to promote healthy blanket bog, with sphagnum moss to act as a sponge in heavy rainfall events.</p> <p>It seems grotesque that the taxpayer is paying for the exact opposite - \u00a32.5 million is about five times as much as is in the Calder Valley flood recovery fund. &#xa0;If Walshaw Moor wants public subsidies, it must use them for the public good and completely restore the blanket bogs on its estate.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blanket bogs have EU protection and 83 percent of the UK's are recovering, largely through stewardship arrangements such as that negotiated over Walshaw Moor. Eleven percent have reached a 'favourable condition.' Their relevance to flooding, in addition to their landscape and natural virtues, <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110320092856/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2008/300108.aspx\">was described </a>by Andrew Wood, Natural England's executive director for evidence and policy, to the House of Commons' environment, food and rural affairs select committee inquiry into flooding in January 2008:</p> <blockquote> <p>Investing more money in traditional flood defences by constructing concrete and earth embankments may no longer be adequate or sustainable in the long-term. We must look to more sustainable solutions including those involving land-use change.</p> <p>The capacity of the countryside to absorb water must be increased. To do this we must start by reversing changes made to landscapes. Restoration of peat bogs in northern uplands would slow water reaching the streams and lowland rivers, reducing the threat to towns such as Ripon, Hull and Sheffield \u2013 all of which have experienced severe flooding.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394497021\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/11/3/1288804434426/Male-Red-Grouse-in-Heathe-001.jpg\" alt=\"Male Red Grouse in Heather\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The quarry: a male red grouse in heather.

In its statement in March it added:</p> <blockquote> <p>Under the terms of the consent, burning will not be permitted in areas where heather amounts to less than 50% of the vegetation cover and will not be permitted in most of the areas defined as sensitive by the Heather and Grass Burning Code 2007. In the areas where it has been agreed that burning can take place, limits have been set regarding the length of the burning rotation. The agreement sets restrictions on the maintenance and creation of infrastructure (such as roads/ tracks, car parks and grouse butts) and there is also agreement relating to weed treatment, stocking densities and vehicle usage. An active programme of peat re-wetting has also been agreed, so that blanket bog restoration can take place.</p> <p>With an agreement now in place, both parties have brought an end to the legal actions that they had been pursuing. For the first time \u2013 and with the agreement of both parties - a framework is now in place for managing this important site, bringing with it the potential to help move the site into a more favourable condition over time.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>More news on grouse-shooting in today's Northerner <a href=\"http://http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/10/asulam-grouse-shooting-moorland-association-spinach-glorious-twelfth\">here.</a></em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/27/david-cameron-hunger-summit-olympics?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">David Cameron's hunger summit</a> focuses on an issue of critical importance for Africa. The crises in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/interactive/2012/jul/19/sahel-food-crisis-guardian-interactive\" title=\"\">Sahel</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jul/20/al-shabaab-hunger-displacement-somalis\" title=\"\">Horn of Africa</a> mean more than 200 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are food insecure. Hunger, combined with a powerful mix of rapidly growing populations, rising food prices, and climate change, is cause for serious concern. To prevent an ever-worsening cycle of hunger, the <a href=\"http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/\" title=\"\">Africa Progress Panel</a> calls on African governments and international agencies to adopt a number of policies.</p> <p>First, put <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jun/13/rio20-smallholder-farms-sustainable-agriculture?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Africa's smallholder farmers and agricultural productivity at the centre of national food security</a> and nutrition strategies. Using minimal energy for heating, transport and production, smallholders are among the world's smallest contributors to climate change. Yet, as the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC) found, they are paying the highest price for other people's emissions.</p> <p>Climate change is likely to hit food security harder in sub-Saharan Africa than any other region. Smallholder farmers face the prospect of increased drought, unpredictable rainfall, water shortages and desertification. These farmers need support with water management and irrigation, drought-resistant seed strains, soil conservation, and climate-resilient cropping to manage the mounting challenge of climate change.</p> <p>Second, create stronger social safety nets and focus more attention on the issue of inequality. When food prices rocket or harvests are poor, social protection programmes can help rural producers cope. Initiatives such as <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/0,,contentMDK:21072837~menuPK:1804110~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258644,00.html\" title=\"\">Ethiopia's productive safety net programme</a> assist farmers to keep their children in school during difficult times without compromising their long-term productivity.</p> <p>Africa may have some of the world's fastest-growing economies, but such headlines conceal major inequalities. We want to see donor and public spending target disadvantaged and marginalised populations.</p> <p>Third, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/20/land-grab-ethiopia-saudi-agribusiness\" title=\"\">create greater protection for Africans from increasingly common \"land grabs\"</a>. Of an estimated 2,000 land deals around the world between 2000 and 2011, Africa accounted for 948 acquisitions covering 124m hectares (306m acres), an area larger than France, Germany and the UK combined. These acquisitions were initially triggered by sharp rises in food prices in 2007. Other factors include increases in the price of oil and growing European demand for biofuels.</p> <p>For Africans, the benefits of such large-scale land acquisitions can be questionable. Foreign investments have resulted in the eviction of many thousands of smallholder farmers from their land, sometimes by force, and typically with minimal compensation. In western Uganda, for example, 20,000 farmers were allegedly evicted, with no compensation, to make way for pine and eucalyptus plantations.</p> <p>We do not question Africa's need for foreign investment. But Africa cannot afford policies that transfer land to investors motivated primarily by profit, to feed populations in other countries or to supply biofuel markets across the globe.</p> <p>Fourth, world leaders need to intensify their commitment to reducing hunger. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/25/2012-g8-summit-private-sector\" title=\"\">G8 agreement on food security and nutrition</a> was a welcome commitment to tackling hunger, but much more needs to be done. Undernutrition still contributes to a third of all child deaths each year. Poor nutrition is undermining the development of many millions more and, with them, the development of societies and economies.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/en/pressroom/press-releases/announcing-caroline-kende-robb-new-executive-director-of-the-app/\" title=\"\"><em>Caroline Kende-Robb</em></a><em> is executive director of the Africa Progress Panel</em></p>",

Today, after running awareness campaigns and building a movement for social entrepreneurship, 34% say they are familiar with the concept \u2013 a remarkable change. Interest has also surged in universities, in government and state agencies. It is a strong trend that coincides with a general interest in entrepreneurship as the way of the future.</p> <p>Playing for Change is a non-profit organisation founded by <a href=\"http://www.kinnevik.se/en/About-Kinnevik/Kinnevik-in-brief/\" title=\"\">Kinnevik Group</a> to improve the lives of children and youth. We invest in exceptional individuals with unique ideas for social change who have the drive to get things done. Through our incubator program they are given salary funding for up to three years and coaching by expert advisers, the Kinnevik Group companies.</p> <p>Many claim that the idea of social entrepreneurship is contradictory to the famous \"Swedish model\". But the stereotype of Sweden as a blown up and inefficient welfare state is far from reality. We have a long and strong tradition of social activism, mobilising people in movements for issues such as child rights and equal rights for women. Sweden also has a century-long tradition of encouraging free enterprise and competition. It is true that social services were not previously driven by the market but this has also changed in the last decades. However, non-governmental organisations combatting social problems have been surprisingly conservative. Most are made after the same pattern; large and member-based entities, set in their ways and increasingly stifled by internal squabbles and a growing bureaucracy. They, more than the public sector, have been opposed to social entrepreneurship and smaller, more business-like setups tackling social problems.</p> <p>I experienced this first-hand when I was very young. Fresh out of high school, I had no track record, nor a network or funds. But I had a vision \u2013 that no child should be subjected to bullying \u2013 and an idea for how to create change. I was shocked to meet so much resistance and distrust from both local decision-makers and traditional activists. They resented me because I did not come in a package they recognised. But rather than discourage me, this made me fight harder. I was convinced then, as now, that one voice can make a difference and that everyone has the potential to create change, be it big or small.</p> <p>I do not predict, like some, that the old-school NGOs in Sweden will shrivel up and die. Nor do I think that social entrepreneurs always bring entirely new ideas to replace the old. Sometimes, we actually come up with old solutions to new problems, but we often find more creative and innovative ways of getting the job done. We can move faster than the traditionalists and adapt to changing circumstances and needs. In this context, social entrepreneurs are important because they challenge the norm and bring a competitive edge into the non-profit sector. Suddenly, everyone is forced to analyse their programs and results in a more critical way, and become better at communicating. The result may be a new and improved Swedish model, transforming the way we combat social problems that can inspire and contribute to the global movement.</p> <p>Of course, the private sector needs educating and adjusting too. Through Playing for Change we combine the non-profit sector's visionary approach with business professionalism and the public sector's social responsibility. When investing in social entrepreneurs it is fair to expect a return, but mainly in social effects \u2013 not in economic profits. The concept is similar to venture capitalism in the sense that we take risks and invest in unproven ideas and people. However, it differs greatly from commercial investments since true social impact for children can take a very long time.</p> <p>Playing for Change challenges potential social entrepreneurs to take the first step toward change through our annual Call to Action campaign. This kicks off our search and selection process where we encourage individuals to apply to our incubator program. Equally important is that the campaign builds public awareness and advocates for social entrepreneurship as a primary tool for realising children's rights. I believe that our program supports not only the handful of social entrepreneurs selected for the incubator program, but also the thousands of people that apply and are encouraged to express their vision and sharpen their pitch. In that way, we are creating a movement for change. We specifically look for early-stage social entrepreneurs with powerful ideas for children.</p> <p>Since the launch of our foundation in 2010, we have supported more than one million children in three continents. This year we take a new, exciting leap; after launching our programs in Sweden, Ghana and Russia, we are moving into new markets in five countries in Africa Our growth has been exceptionally fast and smooth thanks to our close collaboration with companies within the Kinnevik group. Starting up in countries such as Russia or Democratic Republic of Congo, we rely on the support and local expertise of our corporate partners. At the same time, Kinnevik's employees gain knowledge and awareness of children's rights and social entrepreneurship, the core of its CSR programs and strategies.</p> <p>I believe that social entrepreneurship is a primary tool for creating lasting, systematic change for children. To see an idea come to life and achieve real impact constantly renews my strength to continue. And as long as millions of children around the world are denied a safe and happy childhood, I have no choice but to continue my work.</p> <p><em>Sara Damber is chief executive of the Playing for Change Foundation.

  "<p>Manchester United has slashed the price of its shares in advance of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.</p> <p>The club had been set to sell its shares for between $16-$20 (\u00a310-\u00a313) a share but cut the price to $14 late on Thursday following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May.</p> <p>Even after the cut, United will be valued at $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn), making it the most valuable football club in the world. Real Madrid, its closest rival in financial terms, is valued at $1.88bn, according to an annual ranking by Forbes magazine.</p> <p>The shares are being sold by the Glazers, a US family who made their fortune with shopping malls and trailer parks and also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p> <p>The Glazers bought United in 2005 for about $1,250m (\u00a3800m). They are selling 16.7m shares, equal to a 10% stake, and will raise about $330m (\u00a3210m). The family will net about $140m from the flotation.</p> <p>The club claims a global fan base of about 660m and has won a record 19 league titles. Its share sale will be the largest sports listing on record, surpassing World Wrestling Federation's $190m IPO in 1999, according to Thomson Reuters.</p> <p>It will also be the most high profile since Facebook's ill-fated debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange in May. The social network's much hyped share sale proved a bust and shares initially sold at $38 are now worth $20.</p> <p>Wall Street analysts have warned they believe United's sale could also be a disappointment. \"I'm calling this 'son of Facebook',\" said David Menlow, president of the research firm IPOfinancial.com.</p> <p>He said too little of the money being raised looked like it was going to be invested in the club, the club had too many debts and it wasn't clear how it intended to grow as a business.</p> <p>\"Sports franchises have this emotional flourish, then everybody wakes up and wonders, 'do I really want to own this',\" he said.</p> <p>Sam Hamadeh, founder of New York-based analyst PrivCo, called United \"a collectible not an investment\". \"This is one for the rabid fan,\" he said.</p> <p>This is the Glazer family's third attempt at a share sale, having previously scrapped efforts to sell shares on exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p> <p>Those sales failed as investors balked at United's proposed dual class share structure. Under the US listing the family will retain control of the club through class B shares that have 10 times more voting power than the publicly-traded class A shares.</p> <p>The company is also taking advantage of recently-introduced US laws that limit the financial disclosures it must make. United is raising capital as an \"emerging growth\" company under US president Barack Obama's recently passed Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or Jobs, Act.</p> <p>The move means United will not be required to file quarterly reports or be subject to the same level of financial scrutiny as other US-listed firms for five years.</p> <p>Some of the proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to pay down some of the 134-year-old club's debt, which was last reported to be about $661m. But the Glazer family had originally claimed all the proceeds would go towards United's debt, angering some fans.</p> <p>A leading fan group has called for a boycott of the club's sponsors in protest at the terms of the share sale.</p> <p>A statement from the Manchester United Supporters Trust read: \"The Manchester United Supporters Trust has today called for a worldwide boycott of Manchester United sponsors' products, with support across the UK, Europe, Asia and the US. The boycott strategy is intended to send a loud and clear message to the Glazer family and club sponsors that, without the support and purchasing power of the fans, the global strength of the Manchester United brand doesn't actually exist.\"</p>"
