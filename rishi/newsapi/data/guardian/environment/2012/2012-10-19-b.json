  "<p>As a child, when Jemima Dury visited her father's flat in what he called <a href=\"http://ianduryauthor.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/doughnuts-and-coffee-at-catshit-mansions/\" title=\"\">Catshit Mansions</a>, her ambition was to be her dad's minder. She would tidy up his records as Ian Dury, the charismatic, unpredictable singer of Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll, held court, plied his wit and wordplay on a rabble of Blockhead bandmates, hangers on and south London hoods.</p> <p>\"I wanted to be a roadie or a minder, somebody he was really reliant on,\" says Jemima, the eldest of Dury's four children. \"When I was quite young, I would try to carry a bag or open doors. I was very conscious that he liked people to help him. That became a source of approval.\"</p> <p>Dury invented a word for Jemima's slightly anxious ministrations: she was trying to \"daughterise\" him. Now, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/mar/27/guardianobituaries.robindenselow\" title=\"\">12 years after his death from cancer aged 57</a>, Jemima is still trying to add order to his chaotic affairs by editing a book of his brilliant lyrics.</p> <p>We expect rock star dads to be temperamental, absent and with a tendency to lavish their children with inappropriate gifts. Dury did all this. But this gregarious and sometimes vicious man who was paralysed in one leg and arm by childhood polio, also inspired great love and loyalty from those around him, not least Jemima.</p> <p>Her earliest memories of her dad are of him and her mum, Betty, living a bohemian existence in a rambling vicarage near Aylesbury \u2013 they had graduated together from the Royal College of Art. Dury started a band, Kilburn and the High Roads, and \"lots of long-haired, slightly scruffy people\" would drop round to rehearse. Then, when Jemima was four, Dury left his wife, daughter and son, Baxter, to dedicate his life to a career in music.</p> <p>Suddenly, life was impoverished. \"Mum was struggling big time. A lot of people are very critical of Dad for that period because he really did bugger off and leave us in a bad way,\" says Jemima. It was more than four years before Dury could give much in the way of financial assistance to his family when he belatedly found fame, aged 35, with his acclaimed debut album, New Boots and Panties!! in 1977.</p> <p>By then, he was living in Catshit Mansions, overlooking the Oval cricket ground in south London, with his new girlfriend, Denise Roudette, who was a teenager when they met. Jemima only saw him \"perhaps every couple of months\" but found his flat a fantastic place. When they visited, she and Baxter were looked after by assorted dodgy geezers including the Sulphate Strangler, a former roadie and drug addict. \"It was like having the most mental nanny in the world,\" says Jemima.</p> <p>It helped that Betty was so generous over her husband's departure. \"She was never resentful towards him even though she must have had a pretty dark time. I really think she believed in him, to let him go and do that. She knew he was meant to do what he went&#xa0;to do.\"</p> <p>Ian Dury's sudden fame brought financial security but more problems. When <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WGVgfjnLqc\" title=\"\">Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick</a> reached No 1 in 1978, Jemima and Baxter would get whacked by pupils at school. Respite came in the holidays, when they joined their dad on tour. Jemima remembers watching television with Baxter in a hotel in Switzerland while Dury led a wild party in the adjoining suite. After a while, Dury opened the connecting door, \"got into bed and held our hands and sobbed and sobbed and sobbed, and then sat for an hour making up filthy jokes and rhymes. We talked about all the words we could think of for poo, wee and willy. It was hilarious and a really significant moment. He was sort of saying, 'No, you guys are so much more important than all that.'\"</p> <p>She wishes there had been more of those times. \"There weren't enough of those moments,\" she says. \"I just wanted him to be normal a lot of the time. 'Be my normal bloody dad will you? I would rather you helped me do my homework than took me on tour again.' There was a bit of that disgruntlement from me. It was a pretty basic emotional need.\"</p> <p>At times, Dury put his career above the children, promising but failing to turn up for Jemima's lead role in The Nutcracker, her first dance show. She blanked him for \"what felt like two years but was probably a day\" afterwards. On other occasions, his wit turned nasty. Baxter has described his father as \"a Polaris missile\" in his ability to seek out weakness and destroy people with verbal aggression.</p> <p>\"He knew that people wouldn't attack him because they would be accused of knocking down a disabled man,\" says Jemima. \"When he was angry it was pretty nasty. Control is a big part of it. He learned very, very early on how to find a weakness in somebody and really stick the needle&#xa0;in. It was a way of getting back at the world.\"</p> <p>Before polio struck, Dury was a precocious Little Lord Fauntleroy figure, according to his biographer, Will Birch, riding in the Rolls-Royce his working-class father chauffeured, and indulged by his educated mother.Both parents doted on him. \"The very young years, when he was getting his own way, didn't help,\" thinks Jemima. \"Then he got polio, then he was dealing with life as a disabled kid, then he was at Chailey [Heritage craft school, then a notoriously tough institution for pupils with disabilities] and he got bullied, but he learned how to bully.\"</p> <p>When his \u2013 often drink-fuelled \u2013 rages subsided, \"there wasn't much apologising\" says Jemima, \"but he won you over with wit and charm, and being a lovely guy.\"</p> <p>Jemima and her mother both got on well with Dury's then girlfriend Denise, \"the most beautiful, stylish, incredibly vibrant person you could meet\" says Jemima, but after that relationship ended, \"There was a terrible patch when faces just came and went \u2013 you didn't learn anybody's name. It was just constant new girls he'd met a week before at a gig.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, she became friends with a surprising number. \"They weren't that much older than me,\" she says, laughing. \"A lot of womanisers have that ability to stay sweet with people. Not always, he lost a few along the way, but a surprising number are still close family friends.\"</p> <p>Dury never cared much for money \u2013 Jemima remembers loose change was thrown around his flat and her dad would pick up coins to buy a pint of milk \u2013 but with success he assiduously provided for his family, buying Betty and the children a home in Tring, Hertfordshire, paying for Jemima's theatre school and, later, buying his mother a flat in Hampstead.</p> <p>Jemima fulfilled her childhood dream: when she was old enough to drive, she moved into her dad's flat and became his chauffeur-cum-minder, wearing her grandad's chauffeur cap and driving Dury around in a big green Ford Granada. She slept on the sofa because the Sulphate Strangler also lived in the flat. \"It was very funny but quite crackers. Dad would have a conversation with you at 3am. Even when I was at college and had an exam the next day, he'd say, 'Jemima, Jemima, you've got to listen to this tune, it's brilliant!'\" she says. \"I would be the person who had to scoop him up and drag him home once he'd got pissed and fallen over. There was a lot of bailing him out.\"</p> <p>It sounds as if she was a bit like Saffy, the strait-laced daughter trying to rein in her out-of-control mother Edina, in Absolutely Fabulous. \"I think I am Saffy,\" she laughs. \"If you've grown up with a crazy parent, you want things to be quite straight and ordered. I always thought I could really get back at him if I worked in a bank.\"</p> <p>Jemima wasn't completely strait-laced, though. \"There was a little bit of drinking and drug-taking with Dad. His attitude would have been, 'It's better to do it with me than somebody you don't know.' Later on, it was, 'These are better drugs than you'll get anywhere else.'\" She laughs. \"This may seem terribly unscrupulous behaviour by one's father. It can go either way with kids and it didn't have any effect on me whatsoever. It took the mystery out of a lot of things and I actually found it quite boring.\"</p> <p>Jemima chose university over the chauffeuring in her early 20s, when she found Dury too difficult to live with. \"He was very demanding. You had to be quite a menial person \u2013 get his washing from the laundrette, go shopping, drive here and there. It was part of the deal. He needed people to help him out.\"</p> <p>This was partly because of his disability, but also for other reasons: fame, his \"mollycoddled\" childhood, and a fortysomething crisis over his stalled music career. \"I reckon he was drinking and drugging quite a bit. He wasn't in a happy place,\" she says of the late 1980s.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Dury fully embraced family life when he had two sons, Albert and Bill, with his second wife, Sophy Tilson. Jemima and Baxter also enjoyed spending quieter times with him, although the death of their mother, followed not long afterwards by Dury's cancer diagnosis, made it a fraught few years. Jemima believes Dury tried to protect his children by keeping his distance when \"we needed to get close\". In the final months, however, she, Baxter and Sophy worked in shifts to look after him. \"We had amazing times. It was very special, the couple of weeks before he died. I feel so blessed that he died at home,\" she says.</p> <p>Raising her three children in peaceful Hastings with her partner, Japhy, Jemima wonders about the contrast with her childhood. \"The characters around Dad were extreme and colourful and vibrant. I do worry sometimes that my children are having a really dull existence,\" she says, smiling, and wonders whether she should change things. However, she wouldn't want her world shaken up like her own childhood. \"Although we look back on it as this wonderfully exciting time, it was hellish as well. It was chaotic and difficult and wasn't very emotionally supportive.\"</p> <p>Still, Jemima speaks of the difficult times and her brilliant, tricky dad with unwavering warmth and good humour. And she knows her latest project, tidying his archives and selecting his lyrics for a book, is just the latest stage of her \"daughterising\" of Ian Dury.</p> <p><em>\u2022 \"Hallo Sausages\", The Lyrics of Ian Dury, edited by Jemima Dury, is published on 25 October by Bloomsbury, \u00a325.

  "<p>There's a new international class of jet-setting super-rich party boys. Unlike the bankers, these men have been unfazed by the recession. They work for themselves, living lives of excess and getting up when they want. They garner little attention but have an army of disciples under their command.</p> <p>\"People have no idea,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/annie-mac\" title=\"\">Annie Mac</a>, who believes DJ culture is more than just a musical phenomenon, \"because DJs don't really do press; they don't go around telling people how mental they are. And no one understands the level of money DJs earn. They're just people who love music and have managed to make a fucking fortune out of it.\"</p> <p>We're sitting with Mac \u2013 real name Annie MacManus, 34 \u2013 in a posh restaurant near Radio 1. She's ordered sticky chicken wings and is diving in, fingers first. \"It's crazy, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/dec/03/skream-magnetic-man-dubstep-global\" title=\"\">Skream</a> and Benga are like the Sex Pistols!\" she exclaims. \"They are everything that's wild and anarchic about underground music. You know bands like the Who or Led Zeppelin were famous for their excess? It's spoken about, revered. But that's happening every day in DJ world. Even compared to Oasis and what went on at [Noel's famous 90s home] Supernova Heights ... Mate. Go to Croydon on a Friday night. Skream and Benga are gonna make Noel and Liam look like pussies.\"</p> <p>A lot has changed since the first generation of DJ playboys. Oakenfold, Tong et al transformed dance music from a communal to a theatrical pursuit, a lucrative ego trip for the men behind the decks. But DJs had a glass ceiling. Even the biggest DJ in the world could only play at the biggest club in Ibiza.</p> <p>\"I think <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/fatboy-slim\" title=\"\">Norman Cook</a> was the first one who made the transition from the club to the stadium,\" says Mac. \"He was more of an entertainer than a DJ. Now it's regular for quite underground DJs to be playing massive shows.\"</p> <p>DJs are among the few arts professionals in Britain still in high demand. While record companies cough up blood and most bands can scarcely afford to pay their rent, DJs are living through a boom. Teenagers who would balk at the idea of paying a tenner for a record will happily pay \u00a325 to see some bloke play them.</p> <p>Mac is part of the top flight of international DJs, with her own club night, mixtape series and huge shows in Ibiza. But she's also one of the unsung stars of British broadcasting, a presenter who's as adept at hyping a new style of underground dance music as she is listening to schoolchildren's worries about homework in her agony aunt feature Peaceful Ponderings.</p> <p>While working as an assistant producer for <a href=\"http://www.zanelowe.com/\" title=\"\">Zane Lowe</a>, she was spotted by<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/\" title=\"\"> Radio 1</a> and offered a specialist dance show. Big club bookings quickly followed, but at that point she'd only ever DJed at house parties.</p> <p>\"The first few times I played out,\" she recalls, \"I had to write a list of exactly what songs I was gonna play and leave it in front of the mixer.\" She went from novice to the biggest female DJ in Europe in just a few years.</p> <p>Lately, Mac's been following some of the top names in dance around the world for an upcoming Channel 4 documentary about DJ culture, and wants to tell the story of the lifestyle she discovered along the way. Here are her essential tips for the modern bedroom backspinner \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397960415\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350480146039/Annie-Mac-008.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Mac\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Mac</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SO YOU CAN DJ. NOW LEARN TO BACKFLIP</h2> <p>If you want to be an underground house DJ, you can still play in dark rooms without looking up. But in mainstream dance music, it's not OK for you to just look down at the mixer and select records any more. You're expected to do more. When you see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/21/diplo-usher-climax\" title=\"\">Diplo</a>, there's confetti cannons and people spinning around. It's as much acrobatics as DJing. I played a gig last week. It went really well, but one guy tweeted me saying, \"It was awful, I wish I didn't go see it.\" So, just out of interest, I asked what I did wrong, and he was like, \"There wasn't enough crowd interaction.\" Seriously, what do you want me to do? A Q&amp;A?</p> <h2>FIX YOUR HAIR </h2> <p>People like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/calvin-harris\" title=\"\">Calvin Harris</a> have been Vegas-ed: he's got a classy tan, his hair is a little bit blonder and cut into a good shape. All of my friends fancy him now.</p> <h2>CHROME-PLATE YOUR LIVER </h2> <p>Skream is some sort of weird bionic man. No matter what he puts inside himself he's always fine and at the studio at 8am the next day making bangers. He often goes four days without sleeping. It's hard for him, too, because everywhere he goes, people are like, \"Shit we have to get ready, Skream and Benga are coming to town.\" They're expected to fulfil that role of rock'n'roll party boys. From our perspective, we have one crazy night with them; for them, it's crazy every night of their lives. Benga has stopped partying so hard these days but we always say that Skream's just gonna get really fat overnight. Everything's going to crack. He'll age 70 years because he's put so much alcohol into his system.</p> <h2>SELL YOUR FLAT </h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/03/tiesto-tops-forbes-dance-music-rich-list\" title=\"\">Ti\u00ebsto</a> is the richest man in dance music, but he doesn't have a home. He told me this on his private plane. He's genuinely a nomad. He's 43 but he doesn't seem 43, and maybe that's a product of the world he lives in, because he's playing to college kids and lives in this world where it's always a party. You don't really have to worry about mortgages or cutting the grass. You don't have to do any mundane things that make you feel old.</p> <h2>GET A RESIDENCY IN VEGAS </h2> <p>Vegas is massive now in terms of dance music. They use to have billboards for magicians and Celine Dion, now they're for Avicii and Ti\u00ebsto. But the clubs are way more hip-hop: $10,000 to sit on that table, $5,000 for a bottle of Grey Goose and every woman dresses exactly the same. They're like clones: all wearing crotch-skimming bodycon, so short that their buttocks are nearly hanging out. You're so used to England where people are \u2026 fashionable, or just a bit edgy. Edgy is cool, whereas over there it's like edgy is weird.</p> <h2>NO HEAVY PETTING </h2> <p>When you get to that big level of proper superstar DJs, it just makes me sad. So much of that world is just about women in cages with no clothes on. I think that whole format is so tired, and it automatically puts women in the position where they're there to dance to the DJs, rather than being the people who create music. Touring with Ti\u00ebsto for the documentary, it was just a bit depressing. It's not his fault: he likes girls just as much as they like him, it's just the way it is. I always want to be surrounded by fat, hairy men when I play Ibiza as an antidote to what's become an accepted format. Sometimes I see groupies with DJs and I just want to be like, \"Nooo! Please have some self-respect! Come and talk to me!\" The big sister in me comes out and it's hard. But I can't say anything. I just have to be quiet and let it happen.</p> <h2>DON'T DISS GUETTA </h2> <p>I asked Calvin, who has obviously made a massive transition to the mainstream, whether he looks to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/david-guetta\" title=\"\">David Guetta</a> for inspiration. He said, no matter how bad you think David Guetta's music might be, he's opened so many doors for dance music. He's turned small labels into massive industries. He's turned kids on to DJing. He's changed everything.</p> <h2>ONCE YOU'VE REACHED THE TOP, AVOID DUBSTEP DJS </h2> <p>We were filming for the documentary in the Balearics and it ended with both Skream and Benga picking me up and trying to throw me over a balcony in [massive superclub] BCM in Majorca. They put my legs over it and were holding me by my arms. We were about two floors up. I was fearing for my life.</p> <h2>DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO </h2> <p>The more it moves towards dance music as entertainment, with people filming DJs on their phones, the more I rail against it. I want to start a night where you hand your phone in at the door. You're there to enjoy it, not to make shitty clips for YouTube. I just want to play tunes in a corner where no one can see me. I'm well known for having the worst hair in Britain. I look like a hedge. But I feel like I'm flying the flag for curly, dense, bush-like hair. I've also got to a point where I've become a bit sensible. I've stopped drinking and partying. Normally I get a bottle of champagne on my rider and it goes in my bag and straight into the fridge at home. I've got really good at just going in there and being focused and doing it and coming home, and I'm really proud of that. If I don't, I turn into a hateful lunatic, and that's not nice for anyone.</p>",
  "<p>Public opposition to the use of animals in medical research is growing and trust in both scientists and the rules governing the controversial practice is falling, new government-funded research shows.</p> <p>More than one in three people (37%) now class themselves as \"objectors\" to the practice. Their number has been rising steadily since the 29% recorded in 2006 and 35% seen in 2010, though is still lower than the 39% found in 2002, according to the latest research into public attitudes on the issue by Ipsos MORI.</p> <p>Objectors either do not support the use of animals in experimentation because of concern for animal welfare (32%) or believe the government should ban experiments on animals for any form of research (21%), or both. They are more heavily female (41%) than male (33%) and more likely to be those aged 15 to 24 (55%) and also those in the lowest socio-economic class ranked as DE (51% compared to 23% of ABs).</p> <p>That hardening of attitudes is part of what Ipsos MORI called a \"significant\" shift away from people endorsing the need for use of animals in such projects. While 85% of the 1,026 Britons aged 15 and older questioned \"conditionally\" support the practice, that is down from the 90% found in 2010, according to the poll, which the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills paid for.</p> <p>Among those, the proportion backing the use of animals provided it is for medical research has fallen from 76% in 2010 to 66%, with 16% disagreeing. Approval is also down among those who \"unconditionally\" accept such experiments. Those agreeing that animal experimentation does not bother them or they support it for all types of research when there is no alternative, or both, have fallen from 60% to 55%.</p> <p>The poll's findings also show that: \"In 2012, the public are less trusting of scientists not to cause unnecessary suffering in the animals involved (47% now, 54% in 2010), but are also less alert to the possibility of experiments being needlessly duplicated (51% now, 61% in 2010).\"</p> <p>While 54% trust the government's inspectorate and 53% think Britain's rules governing animal experimentation, 43% do not trust the regulatory system \u2013 down from 56% in 2010.</p> <p>But overall 40% said they wanted to know more about animal experimentation before forming a view.</p> <p>The findings have prompted scientists, medical research charities, drug firms and universities to pledge to be more open about the use of animals in experiments in a bid to gain more widespread public support.</p> <p>Understanding Animal Research, which supports \"humane\" use of animals in biomedical research, points out that \"over the last 40 years every Nobel prize in physiology or medicine bar one has depended on work using animals.\"</p> <p>Forty-one organisations, including Cancer Research UK, the Academy of Medical Sciences, Universities UK and the Medical Research Council, have agreed a \"declaration on openness on animal research\". That will see them \"taking part in an ongoing conversation about why and how animals are used in research and the benefits of this\", for example in the search for treatments for cancer, dementia and heart disease. An ensuing concordat will detail as yet undefined moves to make use of animals more transparent, though a major public awareness campaign looks likely.</p> <p>Professor Sir John Tooke, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, said they were \"concerned\" at the poll's results. Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said that, while two-thirds of people still accepted the use of animals for medical research, the 10% should be \"a wake-up call\". Britain's life sciences community need to be \"more forthright about the fact that without animal research, the bio-pharmaceutical sector cannot continue to innovate new treatments\", he added.</p> <p>Sir Mark Walport, head of the Wellcome Trust, Britain's biggest charity, denied \"complacency\" among scientists had led to falling public support. He blamed a continuing \"environment of intimidation\" which, at its most extreme, constituted \"terrorism\", he said. Whitehead said crashing of websites and other illegal tactics had deterred some people involved in conducting or helping animal experimentation.</p> <p>The poll also found that 9% believe it is acceptable for protestors to occupy research facilities or disrupt firms providing services to such research centres, 8% see roadblocks as acceptable and 2% and 1% respectively see destroying property and physical violence in the same light.</p> <p>David Willetts, the science minister, confirmed that talks are going on with airlines and ferry companies about resuming the import of some live animals which are specially-bred overseas for use in trials into conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.</p> <p>\"The government is committed to working to reduce the use of animals in scientific research, but we do recognise that there remains a strong scientific case for the careful regulated use of animals in scientific research and that this does play a role in ensuring new medicines are safe and effective\", he added.</p>",
  "<p>One Thursday morning not long ago, I caught a bus to 1957. Alighting at Crouch End Broadway, I walked into the old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsey_Town_Hall\" title=\"\">Hornsey Town Hall</a> and found myself in the office of a&#xa0;television news producer on whose desk was a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Rand\" title=\"\">Remington Rand</a> typewriter, and next to it a stack of typewritten articles from the wires, clamped together with a hefty metal bulldog clip, the top of which was a report about the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2720000/2720723.stm\" title=\"\">marriage of Prince Rainier to Grace Kelly</a>. On the bookshelves, a 1957 explanatory tome about nuclear power rested next to a contemporary <a href=\"http://www.ukwhoswho.com/\" title=\"\">Who's Who</a>. On&#xa0;a&#xa0;smaller, secretary's desk in the anteroom, a&#xa0;1950s seaside postcard was secured under a glass paperweight.</p> <p>The woman whose office this was strode along the corridor, dressed in an orange skirt suit with a&#xa0;teal blouse, her hair rollered, her face powdered and lipsticked. And then I walked through a&#xa0;doorway and the illusion was broken, for in the space of a yard I found myself transported from the 50s Beeb to a Soho nightclub, one where Martini bottles lined the bar and the velvet-swagged tables were sized for two cocktail glasses&#xa0;and a large ashtray.</p> <p>This is the set of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-hour\" title=\"\">The Hour</a>, which arrived on our TV screens last year billed as the British <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\" title=\"\">Mad&#xa0;Men</a>, but turned out to be something quite different. Both shows deal with sexual politics in&#xa0;a world on the brink of seismic change. But in&#xa0;some ways The Hour, set among the makers of a radical new TV news show, has less in common with Don Draper and co than it does with Rona Jaffe's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/08/best-everything-rona-jaffe-review\" title=\"\">The Best Of Everything</a>, a 1958 novel about&#xa0;the first generation of career women in New York, which Draper is at one point seen reading in bed. As in Jaffe's book, the changing role of women is at the very centre of The Hour, which revolves around the character of Bel Rowley, a young producer based on the real-life BBC producer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Wyndham_Goldie\" title=\"\">Grace Wyndham Goldie</a>. Because it takes as its viewpoint the making of a BBC programme about contemporary events, The Hour is very much about Britain: about the British establishment attempting to adapt to or control a world on the edge of dramatic change. The first series was set against the backdrop of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/suez_01.shtml\" title=\"\">the Suez crisis</a>; the second, which reaches screens later this month, a&#xa0;year later in 1957.</p> <p>Writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/abimorgan\" title=\"\">Abi Morgan</a> is on set the day I visit, despite \"the most horrific hangover ever\". Morgan,&#xa0;whose other recent credits include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140396/iron-lady\" title=\"\">The Iron Lady</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142860/shame\" title=\"\">Shame</a>, is loud but tiny; the hangover comes with a long, funny story that involves being accidentally bought champagne by&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362/\" title=\"\">Danny DeVito</a>. Finding the right backdrop for the new series, she tells me, is a process of \"chasing down history to find the story. Thematically, there are two threads \u2013 the nuclear threat and the start of the cold war, and the internal threat caused by immigration and a new clash of culture. The late 1950s is the moment when Britain breaks free from the old establishment, and signs up to a&#xa0;new world order&#xa0;that is all about money. There's so much going on. It's a ticking clock. To me, that's what&#xa0;The Hour symbolises.\"</p> <p>Fast forward a week, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/romola-garai\" title=\"\">Romola Garai</a> \u2013 the wearer of the aforementioned orange skirt suit \u2013 strides into a Shoreditch photographic studio in an <a href=\"http://www.isabelmarant.tm.fr/\" title=\"\">Isabel Marant</a> cotton top (\"Horribly, horribly expensive, but it is literally my favourite top ever\") and high-waisted jeans, carrying a pack of cigarettes and a take-out coffee. It is the morning after the wrap party, and Garai and her co-stars, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-west\" title=\"\">Dominic West</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/29/ben-whishaw-the-hour?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Ben Whishaw</a>, are back in 2012. Today, they are to be shot in both 1950s and contemporary fashion. It is the modern clothes that Garai is more concerned about: she has what costume designers quaintly call \"an old-fashioned figure\", and that she refers to more colourfully as \"plenty of junk in the trunk\".</p> <p>\"What happened with The Hour,\" she tells me, \"was basically that I picked up the script and the first line I read was, 'Bel is sitting at her desk.' And I was like, well, this is fucking amazing. This part is mine. Because how often are you ever introduced to a young female character and she's sitting behind an actual desk? The main thing I'm interested in is that I don't want the women I play to be defined by their romantic involvement with the male lead. I want them to have a job. So the fact that Bel having a job is the first thing we know about her was a huge deal for me.\"</p> <p>Garai says she recognises a lot of Bel's character&#xa0;in herself. \"We are similar in being ambitious, young women who love our jobs and are truly passionate about them. And who are interested in&#xa0;the world around them, and in politics. But we are different in that Bel is a real diplomat with people, which I'm not at all. I say what I think, and then get into trouble.\" She tries&#xa0;to look sheepish about this, but it's not particularly convincing. \"Actually, I think it's OK&#xa0;to fight for what you care about. The best piece of advice I was given about work was by someone who told me that it's OK to have conflict. I think sometimes women need to be reminded of that.\"</p> <p>\"Hello, Romsey Poms!\" With this greeting to Garai, Dominic West, who plays Hector in The Hour, bursts into the makeup room. He positions himself in front of the mirror, which is the largest in the studio, to check his reflection in the outfit he has been dressed in. (As the shoot progresses, West is often to be found in front of this mirror; Whishaw, on the other hand, tends to&#xa0;slope off to a bathroom to inspect his reflection without an audience.) Garai, who missed the wrap party, asks West how it was. \"Marvellous! Just marvellous. There were dancing girls, Romsey Poms, and you know how I&#xa0;love dancing girls.\" Garai rolls her eyes at me in the makeup mirror, hugs West, and announces fondly that, \"Dominic is an idiot, obviously, but actually we all get on incredibly well. Not just us three [with Whishaw], but everyone. There is a&#xa0;lot of corpsing on the set of&#xa0;The Hour. One day, we got so hysterical they had to clear the set and send us all back to our rooms. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/21/anna-chancellor-interview-the-hour\" title=\"\">Anna [Chancellor]</a> had tears streaming down her face, they had to redo her makeup. We&#xa0;got into so much trouble.\"</p> <p>Later, Whishaw describes it as \"amazing, just a&#xa0;lovely, lovely set. It seems odd to talk about the&#xa0;three of us because the others, like Anna [Chancellor] and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2772105/\" title=\"\">Oona [Chaplin]</a>, are such a vivid part of it. There is just a huge, huge amount of love and honesty and laughter.\"</p> <p>But while The Hour was lavished with praise for its 1950s style, Garai is notably less effusive when we discuss Bel's wardrobe. \"The clothes are&#xa0;the one element of the programme that I feel rather ambivalent about. My choice would have been for her to be dressed in a more realistic way, which would be much tweedier. But needless to say the producers were keen for her to&#xa0;look as glamorous as possible. I feel strongly that how Bel dresses is not how someone in that environment would really have dressed. She wouldn't have wanted to look glamorous, to make herself vulnerable to criticism in that way. If it was down to me, it would've been tweed suits and brogues.\"</p> <p>Many of the same tastes apply in real life, she says, despite today's ultrafashionable Marant. \"I&#xa0;wear a lot of navy and grey, and I do love woolly&#xa0;tights. My sister says I dress like a French teacher. The level of grooming that was involved for women in the 1950s is completely alien to me. I don't wax. I barely shave. If I do my own makeup, I look like I've been to a burns unit.\"</p> <p>The second series of The Hour sees Whishaw's&#xa0;character, Freddie, return older, wiser&#xa0;and better poised as a meaningful rival to Hector for the status of the show's alpha male. As&#xa0;interviewees, the two actors could scarcely be&#xa0;more different. Whishaw sits facing me, neatly cross-legged, hair falling over his eyes, elfin face resting on the points of long-fingered pianist's hands. When he answers a question, he closes his&#xa0;eyes and leans forward, to speak directly into my tape recorder. He talks very slowly, and after Garai's galloping gossip it takes me a few minutes&#xa0;to adjust, so I find myself asking the next&#xa0;question only to realise he is still pondering the last. When West's turn comes, he sprawls on the sofa with one arm thrown across the back, claiming maximum space like a tiger prowling the&#xa0;boundaries of his cage, angling what I suspect he knows is his best side towards me. It is a measure of his charm that he is, despite all this, impossible to dislike.</p> <p>Whishaw, like Garai, was drawn to the character as written by Morgan. \"Freddie is one of those characters you'd like to be more like, in real life. We're similar in that we're both a bit obsessive, but he's braver, bolder. He has absolute courage in his convictions. He's not a saint, but at the centre of him is something very admirable. I think it would be lovely to have that conviction, that very clear belief structure. I guess I wish I had that.\" Whishaw has a whimsical, meandering way of talking, and a tendency to start stories that don't go anywhere. (On clothes: \"I once had a pair of jeans I really liked. I loved them, they were perfect! And then they fell apart and, um, well I&#xa0;didn't buy another pair.\") His ideal day off, he says, would be wandering around the markets and flower markets in east London, where he lives. \"I like to sort of drift about.\"</p> <p>West swears a great deal, loudly and with immaculate enunciation, in the manner of Hugh Grant in Four Weddings. Eton educated, he shook&#xa0;off the posh actor label when he scored his&#xa0;role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a>; having done that, he is free to play posh again. \"Hector is old-school. He was at D-day. But his ambition means that he has to try to leave that behind, to straddle the old establishment and the new.\" A bit like you then? He starts to laugh. \"Well, I think we both enjoy a&#xa0;party. Wine, women and song, you know.\" He smiles at me, longing for the&#xa0;woman from the Guardian to get wound up, so I ignore him and ask about something else, at which point he cuts in to announce, \"I do quite like winding people up. I enjoy winding Romola up, especially. Probably because I just adore her. The thing about Romola is\" \u2013 he calls her \"Romsey Poms\" only when she's there to be teased, I notice \u2013 \"that she doesn't seem to have the slightest idea how sexy and beautiful she is. Oh, fuck, fuck, don't quote me on that. She'll fucking kill me.\" He actually looks quite scared.</p> <p>The Hour's art director is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829378/\" title=\"\">Eve Stewart</a>, whose CV ranges from Mike Leigh films to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzI4D6dyp_o\" title=\"\">The King's Speech</a>. \"I've never known anyone like her,\" Garai says. \"In one meeting scene, I had a piece of&#xa0;paper in my hand, which you couldn't see on camera, and I looked down and it was a precis of&#xa0;a&#xa0;story that had been mentioned in passing in the script as a story The Hour might have covered&#xa0;that week \u2013 the first African American air&#xa0;hostess, I think it was. And it was a proper printed two-page report, on the original 1950s paper&#xa0;typed on an&#xa0;authentic period typewriter. Factually accurate. I mean, is she mad? But there's something about a&#xa0;show in which every department completely commits to making the&#xa0;show real, which somehow transmits itself to&#xa0;the audience.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the&#xa0;on-set office of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147031/\" title=\"\">Suzanne Cave</a>, the costume designer, is plastered with moodboards building a visual backstory for the characters, textured with both contemporary references and those that either layer in other references or add a&#xa0;modern element, helping the clothes read easily to a 21st-century eye. So for Bel's character there are tearsheets from <a href=\"http://www.anothermag.com/exclusives/rachel-weisz\" title=\"\">a shoot of Rachel Weisz in AnOther Magazine</a>, which Cave loved for the saturated block-colour outfits (a true-to-1957 trend that looks right and glamorous for today); for Chancellor's character, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/features/thehour/aps/lix.shtml\" title=\"\">Lix Storm</a>, there are photos of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/katharinehepburn\" title=\"\">Katharine Hepburn</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Sontag\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag</a>; for Freddie, there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jackkerouac\" title=\"\">Jack Kerouac</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesdean\" title=\"\">James Dean</a>, all turned-up collars and shy swagger.</p> <p>The Hour's costumes are a labour of love. The&#xa0;showgirls' stagewear was created by layering strings of pearls, yards of lace and pieces of jet fringing on to old-fashioned corsetted underwear from John Lewis. But the biggest visual challenge, Stewart says, is \"boring offices. They are quite difficult to get right, because no one takes photographs of their boring offices, so it's&#xa0;hard to get the information. And it's the detail&#xa0;that matters.\"</p> <p>So she was thrilled, when first seeing the Hornsey Town Hall building, to find that the door handles were from the correct period (\"You wouldn't believe how long it can take to source the right door handles\"). \"My job is to create a&#xa0;bubble of belief where the story can become real. I do think that if I can help the actors believe, that transmits itself to the audience, almost in a&#xa0;subliminal way. But on the other hand, I know that this all sounds mad.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> The new series of The Hour begins on BBC2 in November.</p>",

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.dugganmorrisarchitects.com\" title=\"\">Joe Morris, architect</a><br></h2> <p>Our life is measured: we don't have much clutter, and we're frugal. If one of us sees something we like \u2013 a vase, say \u2013 we'll have a&#xa0;discussion about it&#xa0;and put it through a vigorous selection process. We're <a href=\"http://dugganmorrisarchitects.com/\" title=\"\">architects</a> \u2013 we're control freaks, and trained to&#xa0;think about these things.</p> <p>Our last house was a Victorian semi, and before that we always lived in period conversions. But our dream was an open-plan space. We found the perfect site in Peckham, south London \u2013 a&#xa0;derelict plot with small industrial sheds, lean-tos and weeds \u2013 and have built a two-storey brick house with a double-height living space, a&#xa0;glass roof, large windows and lush courtyard gardens.</p> <p>Contemporary living does not suit labelling rooms with specific functions: we prefer free-flowing spaces that can be adapted to your needs. At first, it was only me and my partner, Mary, so we didn't feel the need to carve up the space into rooms. The only enclosed room is the bathroom. We now have a three-month-old daughter, Margot. Her cot is in our bedroom space, and we haven't acquired much baby clutter.</p> <p>The space requires management. I&#xa0;have to stay on top of letters and bank statements \u2013 I'm a bit obsessed about having things lying around. In&#xa0;an ideal world, everything would be digital. Things people might perceive as clutter \u2013 books, magazines, ceramics, glassware \u2013 can be easily stored away. We got cards and flowers when Margot was&#xa0;born, but cards are easily folded and the flowers didn't last.</p> <p>Compared with our last house, there's a greater sense of space. The&#xa0;materials are more robust \u2013 timber, brick, oak joinery, polished concrete \u2013 so it's easier to be relaxed here. There's no wallpaper to nick or&#xa0;curtains to pull down. When our nieces and nephews visit, they go ballistic, and nothing gets damaged. It's low-maintenance \u2013 the floor needs sweeping and it's clean. It suits me, as I'm busy. I leave the house at 6.30am and often don't get home until 9pm.</p> <p>We left our furniture in the old house, which we rent out. It was cathartic, but sparse at the beginning. We've added furniture bit by bit, from design shops, eBay and markets. It has made the space feel bigger. It's easier to make pieces work here than in a Victorian house, where contemporary furniture can look out of place. Here, a battered Chesterfield would work as well as a&#xa0;futuristic sofa. The house is a bit like a blank canvas.</p> <p>It's an uplifting environment to live in, particularly with the dense landscaping outside. The worst thing about living here is that you want to build another one.</p> <p><strong>King's Grove was shortlisted for the&#xa0;</strong><a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBASpecialAwards/StephenLawrencePrize/StephenLawrencePrizeShortlist2012.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>Stephen Lawrence Prize</strong></a><strong> at this year's Riba Stirling Prize.</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.stylebubble.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Susie Bubble</a>, fashion blogger</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398059903\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/12/1350046506838/Homes-Susi-Bubble-001.jpg\" alt=\"Homes: Susi Bubble\" width=\"200\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here, there and everywhere: Susie Bubble in the one-bed flat she shares with her boyfriend. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Garland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not messy \u2013 there's only so much you can do with a&#xa0;small space. The flat is tiny: one bedroom, a&#xa0;living/kitchen area and a bathroom. The bedroom is so filled with stuff, I get into bed by rolling in from the bottom. My boyfriend and I try to keep it tidy, but we own a lot of stuff between us \u2013 he's into clothes too.</p> <p>There are shoes everywhere \u2013 I&#xa0;own about 200 pairs and my boyfriend about 30 \u2013 particularly trainers: we kick them off when we get home and leave them lying around. Cycle helmets, leads, adaptors, lamps, bags, folding chairs, bottled water are all out on show because there's hardly any storage and they don't have homes.</p> <p>I can't let go of things. I buy a lot of clothes, and sometimes get given them, but I've still got things from when I was 16, too. I wear them all \u2013 I don't just hold on to things for sentimental reasons. I probably buy one pair of shoes a month, a couple of dresses, the odd vintage piece. But sometimes I'll order stuff online and it will all arrive at once. I'm good at finding stuff in my wardrobe, despite what it looks like. I can be dressed in five minutes. I&#xa0;reach the top shelves on the ladder.</p> <p>The kitchen is filled with empty jars and bottles: if something looks nice, I'll keep it. I take after my mum \u2013 she's got hundreds of jam jars.</p> <p>We've adapted well to the space. We have shelving filled with books, magazines, invitations, press releases, handwritten notes. A&#xa0;wonky plastic trolley in the living room/kitchen keeps the door open, which makes the room feel bigger, and stores my papers.</p> <p>The flat has high ceilings and lots of light, so it feels larger. There's almost too much light \u2013 it glares off my computer screen and wakes me up early. My boyfriend has started working at home, too, so it can get a&#xa0;bit cramped. But my work takes me away a lot.</p> <p>Even if I had a massive place, I'd&#xa0;never be a minimalist: I'd accumulate more. I hate the idea of neat cupboards with things hidden away, out of sight. I'm never going to be ultra tidy \u2013 but the upside of that is, I've never not been able to find something. The flat's too small for anything to be truly lost.</p>",
  "<p>You'll have seen this one around the place. It looks, at first glance anyway, a little bit like a Bentley from the front. But then the more you see of it, and the more you&#xa0;look, the less like a Bentley it becomes. It's brasher, louder, cheaper, more American. Actually, on this, the car's second incarnation, the grille is less like a Bentley's; it's been replaced by a more American one. The car has lost some of its distinguished looks.</p> <p>It is still distinctive, though, with its high sides and squat windows, there's a certain badassness about it, the kind of car you can possibly imagine a Chicago gangster driving, or cruising along The Strip in Vegas. Maybe the rear window lowers, the muzzle of a semi-automatic weapon appears, pow pow pow, the window is raised as the car speeds off to the sound and smell of burning rubber...</p> <p>Here, parked on my Victorian London terrace, it just looks ridiculous. It <em>is</em> ridiculous, and it's embarrassing. It's too big, it doesn't fit. And it's too big driving around town, too. It's vast, a proper tank.</p> <p>On the open road it makes a&#xa0;bit more sense \u2013 powerful, easy, comfortable, big. You get a real sense of momentum in it, the feeling it will carry on, for ever, in a straight line, on a straight road\u2026 in America, where it belongs. And where this kind of vulgarity is acceptable. And where the 28th amendment to the constitution protects an individual's right to burn oil, no matter what the&#xa0;cost to the planet.</p> <p>OK, so in Europe it comes with a V6 diesel engine, but even so it's a lot thirstier and CO<sub>2</sub> fartier than the equivalent European (probably German) diesel luxo barge. The German will be a better car, too, more suited to Europe's roads, and&#xa0;more refined inside.</p> <p>So all the Chrysler really has going&#xa0;for it is its style. But looks alone aren't enough to keep a relationship going. Especially when they're not as striking as the&#xa0;previous model's. And when they don't stand up to closer scrutiny. Look at it, it's not really as badass as it thinks it is, is it? I don't believe any self-respecting gangster would really want to be seen dead (maybe literally) in one of these. No&#xa0;rapper either, or footballer, just as they wouldn't want to have a fake gold Rolex on their wrist.</p> <p>Because that's what this car is, a&#xa0;fake. And if you're going to not give a toss about the environment, you may as well do it&#xa0;in style. In a&#xa0;real Bentley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396855060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348839763088/Chrysler-300C-CRD-V6-Exec-002.jpg\" alt=\"Chrysler 300C CRD V6 Executive detail\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chrysler 300C CRD V6 Executive detail Photograph: Simon Stuart-Miller</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Stuart-Miller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Chrysler 300C CRD V6 Executive<br></h2> <p><strong>Price</strong> \u00a339,995<br><strong>Top speed</strong> 144mph<br><strong>Acceleration</strong> 0-60 in 7.4 seconds<br><strong>Combined consumption</strong> 39.2mpg<br><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> emisions</strong> 191g/km<br><strong>Green rating</strong> 3/10<br><strong>Cool rating</strong> 4/10</p>",
  "<p>On 9 October 1965, Yale University released to public view a map that caused a media frenzy \"akin to the detonation of a small bomb\". The so-called Vinland map was a crude creation on vellum, 27.8cm high by 41cm wide, with a vertical fold through the middle, a few worm holes, and purporting to date from the mid-15th century. What was so devastating about the map? It showed a \"startlingly accurate\" representation of \"Vinland\" (Wineland) \u2013 the name given by the Vikings to North America \u2013 including part of Newfoundland or Labrador: \"almost certainly the result of original exploration\".</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/28/simon-garfield-life-in-books\" title=\"\">Simon Garfield</a> explains in <em>On the Map</em>, his rollick through the history of western map-making, the Vinland map indicated not only that there was \"European knowledge of Norse sailings to North America some 50 years before Columbus\", but also that, \"according to an explanation on the map ... the discovery itself had occurred between 985 and 1001.\" Let loose into the world just before Columbus Day, the map incensed Italians and Italian-Americans with its claim to \"assail the priority of Columbus's discovery of the New World\". Everything we had learnt in school was, apparently, wrong.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.maphistory.info/saenger.html\" title=\"\">The Vinland map</a> was unearthed in autumn 1957 by Laurence Claiborne Witten II, a New Haven rare book and map dealer, as he rummaged through a fellow dealer's stock in Geneva. Witten was acutely aware of the map's controversial nature, and the strong possibility of forgery, but instinct told him it was authentic. One detail niggled, however: the placing of the worm holes on the map didn't match those on its accompanying document, throwing the map's provenance into question. But in winter 1958, Witten chanced on an undoubtedly genuine medieval manuscript whose watermark and, crucially, worm holes exactly matched those of the map. \"My adrenaline began to flow,\" Witten recalled. This \"seemingly made it nearly incredible that [the Vinland map] could be a modern forgery\". Certainly the wealthy<a href=\"http://www.paul-mellon-centre.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"> Yale alumnus and philanthropist Paul Mellon</a> was convinced: he bought the map for $300,000 (85 times the sum Witten had originally paid), donating it to Yale, where it was displayed in the recently opened Beinecke Library.</p> <p>But in the ensuing decades, with advances in microscopy the spectre of forgery was resurrected. Examinations of the map in the 1970s found large traces of a pigment that was only available commercially from 1920, and in 2004 a map historian even surmised the identity of the hoaxer responsible for the map's creation. Josef Fischer was an Austrian Jesuit, and an expert in medieval cartography and the history of Nordic exploration. In the mid-1930s, \"Fischer and fellow Jesuits had fallen foul of the Nazis\", and the Vinland map may have been a kind of revenge \u2013 it realised a Nazi dream about Aryan Vikings but, crucially, the map is laden with Catholic imagery. Despite its ambiguous nature, the Vinland map has nevertheless been valued at $20m, and Garfield concludes that \"even if it is a fake (and we may never know for sure), its true and lasting value goes beyond its authenticity or fraudulence. Its value is in the narrative.\"</p> <p>These days, maps are no longer the preserve of the geek. Through various recent TV series, exhibitions and map-minded histories and memoirs, old maps \u2013 and the stories of their creation and dissemination \u2013 are enjoying a robust popularity (in no small way indebted to a widespread nostalgia for folded paper maps in the face of sat navs and other digital navigational technologies). Garfield's account of the Vinland map episode encapsulates his fascination with the most alluring aspects of cartographical history. Its deliciously ambiguous tale of hoaxing and forgery throws into relief the conflict between truth and lies that defines all map-making endeavours. Beneath maps' veneer of authority and power lies the inevitable reality of selectivity, omission and error. No map can show everything: Jorge Luis Borges described the absurdity of the intention to make a map on the scale of 1:1, whose \"size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it\". But some maps \u2013 such as the influential surveys of Africa produced in 1798 by the map-maker <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498150/James-Rennell\" title=\"\">James Rennell</a>, on which an entire mountain range, the Mountains of Kong, were conjured out of thin air \u2013 owe even less of a debt to reality than others.</p> <p>An exhibition of maps at the British Library in 2001 and 2002 was punningly entitled <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/lieland/m1-0.html\" title=\"\"><em>Lie of the Land: The Secret Life of Maps</em></a>, and Garfield intends <em>On the Map</em> to be something similar. He conceives of the book as \"a journey around an exhibition\", in which a plethora of stunning and important cartographical artefacts are held up for our persual, but in which our attention is also drawn to the untrustworthy face of maps, their intriguing blank spaces and deliberate distortions. He is enthralled by the reciprocal rapport between maps and fiction: the presence of mythical beasts on old charts, the dangerously captivating qualities of treasure maps, and the multifaceted use of maps in games, from jigsaw puzzles and <em>Risk!</em> to <em>Skyrim</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto 4</em>. Garfield is particularly excited by the relationship between maps and films, and the idea that \"a large proportion of the advances in digital cartography that we now take for granted ... all happened first in the movies, where the technology prefigured and inspired real-life cartographic possibility.\"</p> <p>If <em>On the Map</em> is intended as a cartographical exhibition, then it is a boisterous and bustling one. Garfield is at his best when describing the human face of map history, the \"boastful dealers, finicky surveyors, guesswork philosophers, profligate collectors, unreliable navigators, whistling ramblers, inexperienced globe-makers, nervous curators, hot neuroscientists and lusting conquistadors\" responsible for the creation, publication and usage of some of the western world's chief cartographical landmarks. And as one might expect from the author of <em>Just My Type</em>, he is also fascinated by print culture, by maps as physical objects and by stories of their printing and dissemination through a rarefied world of dealers, curators and collectors.</p> <p>There is less room in <em>On the Map</em> for the surveyors themselves, particularly their methods and instruments. And although Garfield's definition of \"map\" is admirably expansive (he turns his attention to guidebooks, written itineraries and globes, as well as nautical charts and modern digital \"mash-ups\"), his exhibition is less broad in geographical focus, and predominantly restricts its gaze to the western world, lacking the global spread of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/24/history-world-twelve-maps-review\" title=\"\">Jerry Brotton's recent <em>History of the World in Twelve Maps</em></a>. Neither does he consider how the cartographic artefacts on display have influenced one another. But all surveys \u2013 books or maps \u2013 are by nature selective, and <em>On the Map </em>is a survey of some of the most intriguing and thought-provoking moments in map history, narrated with a level of detail, colour and liveliness of which the most ambitious mapmaker would be proud.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Hewitt's <em>Map of a Nation</em> is published by Granta.</p>",
  "<p>This week the <a href=\"http://www.mobydickbigread.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Moby-Dick</em> Big Read</a>, which I have co-curated with the artist Angela Cockayne, reached Chapter 30, \"The Pipe\" \u2013 read by David Cameron. Last week Fiona Shaw tackled a chapter on whale oil; next week we have Will Self reading \"The Whiteness of the Whale\", with other readings, by Benedict Cumberbatch, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Richard Hawley, China Mi\u00e9ville and Cerys Matthews, yet to come.</p> <p>But this is a democratic crew, and such celebrated names are joined by fishermen, schoolchildren and a vicar. Equally, Angela and I have used works by contemporary artists, such as Anish Kapoor, Antony Gormley, George Shaw, Susan Hiller, Boyd Webb, Dorothy Cross and Alison Turnbull \u2013 some of them specially created for the project \u2013 to expand the readings into an audiovisual rendition of Melville's book. Indeed, given that he lacked an editor, and tried to cram everything he knew about whales and whaling between two covers, his work seems peculiarly suited to a digital age. In many ways, <em>Moby-Dick</em> was more like a Victorian blog, and I often think that if Melville had been writing his book today, he would never have finished it: he'd be perpetually entering \"whale\" into a search engine.</p> <p>The <em>Moby-Dick</em> Big Read aims to mirror the wildly digressive nature of Melville's book, but also to reflect on its subversive sense of prophecy. The greatest American novel may also be one of the most unread books, dense with 135 chapters of Victorian prose. Yet it is also wryly funny, violently exciting and, even now, politically charged. Indeed, the book is so freighted with hidden meaning and double entendre that it was difficult to find a reading that No 10 would accept. Chapters on whaling might appear to condone hunting; others mentioning \"Muslim empires\" have their own problems. But then, reading <em>Moby-Dick</em> is like having the future re-run before you. Witness this quote from the first chapter, read by Tilda Swinton: \"Grand contested Election for the Presidency of the United States / WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL / BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN\".</p> <p>There are reasons why it is Barack Obama's favourite book; also Morgan Freeman's. Published not long before the American civil war, it has been widely seen as a comment on the internecine conflict over slavery \u2013 it is no coincidence that the whale is white. In the 1920s, DH Lawrence wrote that Captain Ahab is the \"doom of our white day \u2026 And the Pequod is the ship of the white American soul.\" Thirty years later, the Trinidadian writer CLR James was clear on the subject. Reading <em>Moby-Dick</em> during his enforced stay on Ellis Island, barred from entry to Manhattan, he mused that Ahab's madness is a form of imperialist critique. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9781584650942/mariners-renegades-and-castaways-the-story-of-herman-melville-and-the-world-we-live-in\" title=\"\"><em>Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the World We Live In</em></a>, James drew a direct analogy between Ahab and Hitler, Stalin and other 20th-century dictators who kept the masses in thrall to their personality cult: \"He has at his sole command a whaling-vessel which is one of the most highly developed technological structures of the day. He has catalogued in his brain all the scientific knowledge of navigation accumulated over the centuries. This is one reason why he is so deadly a menace.\"</p> <p>Other US writers and artists even saw Moby Dick as an avatar of the nuclear age. Writing in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, the artist Gilbert Wilson saw the White Whale as an augury of atomic conflict, and Ahab's \"insane pursuit of Moby Dick into the Sea of Japan\" as analogous to America's \"atrocious nuclear experiments and explosions in the same area\".</p> <p>Little wonder that, when the same New York Harbour view that James had seen was still smouldering from the 9/11 attacks, Edward Said declared in the New York Times that George W Bush was no better than a demented Ahab and the \"war on terror\" was an impossible pursuit like the captain's demonic hunt for the White Whale. Such interpretations have only increased in recent years. The book's exposition of the 19th-century Yankee fleets trawling the world for whale oil has been compared to our dependence on crude oil, and all that follows from it.</p> <p>But it is not all doom and gloom. Melville, who was almost certainly gay, created one of the most homoerotic passages in 19th-century literature in the chapter \"A Squeeze of the Hand\". In it, Ishmael and his crew gather round a tub of sperm oil, squeezing out the lumps and, occasionally, each other's hands. (It's read for us by the playwright Tony Kushner.) Meanwhile America's arch-ironist, John Waters, reads \"The Cassock\", devoted entirely to the whale's foreskin. In earlier chapters, read by Stephen Fry and Neil Tennant, Ishmael and Queequeg cosy up in bed, declaring themselves husband and wife; a premonition of Cameron's support for gay marriage, perhaps? And I'd defy anyone not to be roused by Simon Callow's magisterial \"The Sermon\", or deeply moved by David Attenborough's reading of \"Does the Whale Diminish?\", an eerie foreshadowing of the desperate straits to which these beautiful animals would be reduced by acts of human dominion.</p> <p>And just in case you thought <em>Moby-Dick</em> had no relevance to your life, remember who supplies your daily latte, named after Ahab's recalcitrant first mate: Starbuck. It is a wry irony that Melville would have appreciated, especially given the extraordinary trajectory of his art. His book vanished without trace in his lifetime; resurfaced in the 1920s when it was reappraised by Virginia Woolf, WH Auden and Lawrence as a work of modernism before modernism was invented; became seen as a critique of imperialism and the evil that men do; foresaw the destruction of the natural environment; and ends up supplying the world with a chain of coffee bars.</p> <p>Herman, where art thou? Shrugging his shoulders, I'd say. \"I've written a blasphemous book,\" he announced, shortly after the <em>Moby-Dick</em> launch party (attended by just one guest, Nathaniel Hawthorne), \"and I feel as spotless as the lamb.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"<em>Malamikete de las nacjes, / Cad\u00f3, cad\u00f3, jam temp' est\u00e1, / La tot' homoze in familje / Konunigare so deb\u00e1.</em>\" (Enmity of the nations, / Fall, fall, it is already time, / All mankind in (one) family / Must unite itself.) The author of this late 19th-century hymn to internationalism, couched in a language so tantalisingly familiar and yet so frustratingly hard to pin down, was the Russian-Jewish linguist Ludwig Zamenhof, the begetter of Esperanto (meaning \"Hopeful\"). It was Zamenhof's hope that his universal language might open up an escape route from destructive nationalist conflicts, mapping instead a possible path to world peace. While the vision was utopian, the transformation it envisaged was necessarily incremental, and the project was solidly anchored in grammatical and lexical detail - perhaps too much detail. Enthusiasts for world harmony turned out to be no less fractious than the xenophobic nationalists they aspired to tame, and their own petty disputes over language \u2013 and in particular an enhanced form of Esperanto termed Ido (meaning \"offspring\" in the parent language) \u2013 soon led to an Ido-Esperanto schism.</p> <p>While it's easy to snigger at the grandiose delusions of Esperantists and other similarly dreamy minorities, such as advocates for a single world government, Earth doesn't seem entirely safe in the hands of the rest of us, with our passive but pragmatic acceptance of conventional politics-as-usual. At times I despair that the only order of things that might actually save the planet from environmental degradation is a global eco-dictatorship, in itself almost as worrying a prospect as the failure of the biosphere. How did we get to this depressing pass? Modern history in the industrial age appears to be the story of a fragmented humanity obsessed, alas, with its own parochial comforts and local interests, with little sense of the common needs of humanity as a whole. Except, as Mark Mazower shows in his brilliant recasting of the course of modern history since the Napoleonic wars, it's not as simple as that. While historians tend to tell stories about nations and their leaders, there is another way of relating the history of the last two centuries that brings into focus the role of global visionaries in reimagining a connected world community, and also the unsung efforts of practical secretariats of international organisations which \u2013 up to a point \u2013 succeeded in implementing a measure of global order.</p> <p>Europeans learnt various different lessons from the French revolution and Napoleonic wars. If the ancien r\u00e9gime, or at least a modified version of it, was to endure \u2013 reckoned nimble conservatives such as Metternich, Talleyrand and Castlereagh \u2013 then a broader international vision was required. Disturbances in one country could all too easily lead to universal conflagration, as Europe as a whole had learnt to its cost in the 20 years of warfare that had followed the French revolution. The \"Concert of Europe\" these men inaugurated was an informal scheme of cooperation among the great powers, which would aim at the maintenance of an overall balance of power and try to prevent crises, wherever they arose, from spiralling out of control.</p> <p>However, for other prophets of global order, Metternich and his friends were themselves the main threat to peace. Wars stemmed from the machinations of diplomats in elegant salons, and provided the sport of military aristocracies in every country. Peace was not to be obtained by careful adjustments to the balance of power, but by a major overhaul of the international system. Counterintuitively, as it might seem today, the radical Italian patriot Giuseppe Mazzini thought nationalism was the answer: once aggressive, top-down multi-ethnic empires were replaced by authentic national democracies, then a harmonious international society of states would be possible. The English Liberal Richard Cobden sought an alternative approach to peace in free trade. Cobden's pacific, anti-militarist vision of a reformed global economy of friendly, untrammelled exchange between commercial peoples (rather than their expiring feudal aristocracies) serves as a salutary reminder that while the cause of the (supposedly) free market has too often been affiliated in our own times with the military-industrial complex, the provenance of laissez-faire ideas was anti-elitist and far from conservative. Marxism too was a product of this milieu. Communist internationalism, Mazower argues, is best understood as yet another \"variant of the profusion of mid-19th-century visions of world order\".</p> <p>Well-intentioned woolliness of the sort that brings to mind Dickens's Mrs Jellyby was a striking characteristic of the era. Nevertheless, as Mazower shows, impractical high-mindedness was counterbalanced by effective international cooperation during the third quarter of the 19th century on a range of issues: humanitarian, juridical and scientific. The International Red Cross Committee, which had its beginnings in Switzerland in 1863, was the brainchild of Henri Dunant, a Swiss businessman, spurred to action by the suffering he had witnessed at the Battle of Solferino in 1859. However, in order to carry out its mission effectively, the new organisation required some kind of inter-governmental imprimatur, which it obtained from several small states, which met at the first Geneva Convention in 1864. As Mazower notes, this event marked a new departure in two directions. First, it involved small countries rather than the great powers of the Concert taking the lead. Furthermore, it marked a shift away from the pious hope that war might be stamped out entirely towards the more attainable goal that the practice of warfare be regulated&#xa0;and made, if only slightly, less horribly bestial.</p> <p>Along a parallel route the Belgian lawyer Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns established an Institute of International Law in Ghent in 1873. No longer would international relations be the exclusive monopoly of a traditional caste of diplomats who preferred discretionary powers and secret deal-making to rules and formal arbitration. The International Telegraphic Union was founded in 1865 to facilitate speedy cross-border communications, and the Universal Postal Union followed in 1874. In line of descent from these enduring late 19th-century developments was the League of Nations, whose energetic secretariat \u2013 including the founding father of the European Union, Jean Monnet \u2013 and unsung practical activities in fields such as public health Mazower rehabilitates from post-1945 condescension.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Mazower's history is not a straightforward celebration of virtuous internationalists and the \u2013 relatively speaking \u2013 kinder, gentler world they have created: an achievement now recognised in the EU's Nobel peace prize. Mazower exposes the ways in which the great powers \u2013 not least the US, under cover of the United Nations \u2013 have exploited international organisations as a fig-leaf for the otherwise naked exercise of self-interest. Nor does he allow us to forget the international double standard: that darker-skinned peoples outside Europe were long deemed to lack the requisite manners and institutions that would entitle them to join the much-vaunted community of civilised nations. Among Mazower's many delicious and understated ironies is his discussion of King Leopold II's Belgium: notorious for Leopold's personal exploitation of the Congo, which provoked Conrad's nightmarish masterpiece <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, but also, it transpires, the centre of \"fin-de-si\u00e8cle internationalist life\".</p> <p>\u2022 Colin Kidd's <em>British Identities Before Nationalism</em> is published by CUP.</p>",
  "<p>I'm standing, with my friend Penny, outside a disused shopping centre in Reading. The place is deserted and has a vague air of impending doom. Penny has brought a balaclava.</p> <p>\"If the worst comes to the worst,\" she says, pulling it over her head, \"I'm going to stop, face the wall and hope to blend in. Yesterday I was quite excited about doing this. Now I slightly wish I'd gone to the organic farmers' market.\"</p> <p>There's good reason for her worry. We're here to do battle with the undead at one of a growing number of UK horror immersion experiences. Penny has come fully prepared. She's wearing trousers designed by Bear Grylls. I'm in my PE kit. I stare down at myself and wonder if this is going to be enough to fend off the forces of evil?</p> <p>A man called Martin has just shown me, on his iPhone, what we're about to do. There's a lot of blood. And running. And endless screaming.</p> <p>\"Has anyone here,\" asks a man with a goatee, \"got any practical post-apocalypse zombie killing experience?\"</p> <p>Deafening silence.</p> <p>\"OK. Well we've had a few people wet themselves, one man shat his pants, we've had a panic attack and one vomit. Are you afraid of clowns?\"</p> <p>I nod.</p> <p>\"Oh dear.\"</p> <p>There are about 20 of us and we're ushered through to a long narrow corridor where we have to fill in infection report forms. A small, solid woman called PC Russell is looking after us. She stands, legs slightly apart, and tells me, in all seriousness, that she's there to \"ensure all civilians are in a safe and controlled environment\".</p> <p>Someone whispers something about a \"breakout\" and with that, we're plunged into darkness. Something is pounding ferociously on the door we've just been shoved through. The zombies are coming \u2026</p> <p>PC Russell is then joined by three other police officers in riot gear. We're told to start running, which we do as if our lives depended on it, until we find ourselves at a double door. The police officers, armed, order two of us to open the doors on their command. As we yank them open, a roaring zombie looms towards us, all undead and hungry for brains, and grabs a man in a green hat. We never see him again. Everybody is screaming. Everybody.</p> <p>By now I am in such a state of advanced fear that I can't get my hands on a weapon quick enough. We're bundled into a safe room, given flak jackets and armed with pump-action shotguns that shoot soft pellets. We're taken on to a firing range, taught how to use them and then go back to the safe room, where one of our police officers has gone missing. There's more banging, we're abandoned, shots ring out and then three of the police officers reappear, dragging a dead zombie behind them.</p> <p>I don't think I've blinked, not once, in half an hour.</p> <p>Our mission is quite clear. We have to get the hell out of here, but before we can get to the roof of the shopping mall for a planned evacuation we have to negotiate all five levels of it, four of which are in pitch darkness and all of which are rammed with zombies.</p> <p>I won't reveal the remainder of what happens but I can quite happily tell you that the four hours I spent fighting zombies is, beyond all doubt, one of the greatest things I have ever done. It's amazing. It's thrilling, it's terrifying, it's fun. The first two hours are spent playing out a scenario but from then on, you're on your own. There are missions to try and fulfil but the longer you're in there, the more you get to know your zombies. Some can run. And they want to catch you. I shall say no more.</p> <p>I think the thing I was most struck by was how everybody, without exception, was giddy with excitement. Every trip back to the safe room to reload was awash with warriors telling tales, and I realised that, as adults, we never play. We can play board games, we can play sports but we don't play like children, and the greatest gift of this experience is that all of us were totally committed to role-play without even realising it.</p> <p>Afterwards, you get to hang out with the zombies. They were all lovely and softly spoken. One was a music producer, another was an engineer and one, the zombie who \"killed\" me during one rather intense encounter, used to work for social services.</p> <p>\"I'm a professional wrestler now. And a zombie. It's much better.\"</p> <p>In fact four of our number loved it so much they signed up to come back as zombies.</p> <p>An utterly brilliant day out.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The mall experience was provided by Zed Events (</em><a href=\"http://www.zedevents.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>zedevents.co.uk</em></a><em>, \u00a3139pp, next availability March 2013).

  "<p>Are you, a US citizen, calling cousin Ivor in Budapest, or reaching out to your old pen pal Yasmeen in Sydney? The National Security Agency (NSA) can listen in on your personal cellphone or read what you might be emailing him or her from your personal computer without telling you. </p> <p>In 2008, the US Senate <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/10/washington/10fisa.html?gwh=8978A891887ACD9466895831C4E77845\">voted</a> to let the NSA wiretap any US citizens' emails and phone calls internationally in the interest of national security so long as the government's purpose was to collect \"foreign intelligence information\". In 45 minutes, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ checkpoint-washington/post/court-allows-challenge-of-us-surveillance- law/2011/09/21/gIQA5Z5ZlK_blog.html\">constitutional challenge </a>to the Fisa Amendments Act. As the Director of the ACLU's Center for Democracy, Jameel Jaffer, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jameel-jaffer/a-brewing-battle-over-war_b_1279361.html\">pointed out</a>, the amendments: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"gave the NSA unprecedented power to monitor the international communications of people living in the United States \u2014 to listen to their phone calls, and to read their emails. 'We are targeting our own country', one NSA whistleblower observed.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Though some in Congress argued that citizens were safe from having their communications intercepted \"unless you have al-Qaida on speed-dial\", dragnet surveillance of people with nothing at all to do with terrorism began at once. As Marty Lederman, at that time a law professor, <a href=\"http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/07/al-qaeda-on-speed-dial.htmls\">noted</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The new statute permits the NSA to intercept phone calls and e-mails between the US and a foreign location, without making any showing to a court and without judicial oversight, whether or not the communication has anything to do with al-Qaida \u2013 indeed, even if there is no evidence that the communication has anything to do with terrorism, or any threat to national security.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Feds can listen in to you now, \"whenever government deems it necessary for foreign intelligence reasons\" Jaffer explained to me. The vagueness of a phrase such as \"material support\", and the chilling effect resulting from that vagueness, was at the heart of the successful National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) group challenge.</p> <p>These Fisa amendments lose their authority in December, and the reauthorization battle will unfold in the context of a new high profile lawsuit's activities. This lawsuit is taking shape much like the one aforementioned <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/5/17/journalist_plaintiff_chris_hedges_hails_monumental\">that was won last month</a> by a group of reporters and activists such as Noam Chomsky and Chris Hedges. The ACLU group's lawsuit <a href=\"http://www.antiwar.com/ips/fisher.php?articleid=13181\">includes</a> several journalists and organizations including Naomi Klein, Chris Hedges, Human Rights Watch, the Global Fund for Women, the Pen American Center and the Nation Magazine.</p> <p>These citizens argue that they have changed their approach to work out of fear of incarceration for \"material support\" for terrorism if the NDAA was used against them. The ACLU group argues fear of NSA surveillance is hampering the abilities of these people to report the news, gain testimony from witnesses and represent victims of human rights abuses.</p> <p>Is it \"necessary for foreign intelligence reasons\" for NSA agents to spy on a Human Rights Watch lawyer talking to a woman service member about having been abused by a US contractor? Is it reasonable under those terms to spy on <a href=\"http://www.ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/supreme-court-refuses-hear-wiretapping-case,-government-can-keep-secret-whet\">a lawyer for a Guantanamo detainee</a> seeking to have a confidential discussion to build his defense against a bogus US charge (a transcript that then gives the US lawyers at Gitmo yet another advantage unavailable to opposing counsel in real due process situations)? Can the US government agents record non-fiction writer Naomi Klein's phone calls to fellow activist journalists in the UK, or to UK government sources who would want to leak a potential story to her? Maybe one involving US wrongdoing? </p> <p>Under these terms \u2013 sure thing, not a problem. (I should note, as always, that when governments eavesdrop on reporters and activists for \"national security\" they also secure leverage for all kinds of other harassment \u2013 even blackmail or entrapment on other issues \u2013 <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120536943121332151.html\">Eliot Spitzer-style</a> \u2013 since private relationships and conversations are swept up as well.) These groups all depend on access to confidential communications with their clients, as well as with witnesses to human rights abuses and other sources.</p> <p>The ACLU says the FBI and NSA are currently abusing the warrantless dragnet surveillance. When the organization filed a Freedom of Information Act request to see how it was actually being used, the FBI sent them some heavily redacted pages and explained that they could not yield more information about the surveillance since the business of turning in information on citizens' communications risk economic harm if their snitching were common knowledge. The ACLU wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The government doesn't want you to know whether your internet or phone company is cooperating with its dragnet surveillance program because you might get upset and file lawsuits asserting your constitutional rights.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the government's response to the lawsuit, you see the incredibly Alice-in-Wonderland-like nature of logic on the far side of the slide to totalitarian institution-building in America. Just as the government classified the techniques its agents had used to torture Gitmo inmates \u2013 and then threatened lawyers for prisoners with prosecution if they <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/september-11-attacks/9610884/Guantanamo-judge-orders-Khalid-Sheikh-Mohammed-lawyers-not-to-discuss-torture.html\">brought up the torture</a> on the grounds they would be revealing classified information \u2013 so are Obama's lawyers asserting that the litigants have no status to be plaintiffs since they were monitored in secret \u2013 essentially, they can't prove that they were monitored!</p> <p>I am not making this up: the government's position is that the ACLU's clients lack standing <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/warrantless-wiretapping-supreme-court\">because</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>they can't prove that their communications were (or will be) monitored under it. </p> </blockquote> <p>Right, because there are no warrants presented to subjects, which the fourth amendment requires, to prove that wiretapping is taking place. Because it is secret. Which is what the lawsuit challenges. And so on. Jaffer rightly calls that a cynical argument.</p> <p>Indeed, if you follow this line of argument, any lawsuit from any citizen involving secrecy could be thrown out for lack of proof if the secrecy obscuring the harm done to that citizen is sufficiently intact. We may be seeing a trend, or some sunlight, in the judiciary. Just as Judge Katharine Forrest stayed the NDAA recently because the Chomsky group proved harm, so are the ACLU team getting some traction.

Yes, gas is better than both coal, which produces twice as much CO2, and nuclear, with its serious safety issues. But Helm says gas is in near limitless supply. If so, why are energy companies now pushing to use fracking to extract that gas? Gas is like oil: even though there may be enormous quantities left, as time goes by, companies need to resort to ever more environmentally damaging methods (fracking, tar-sands, Arctic drilling etc) to get to those resources.</p> <p>Every source of energy carries a cost. For gas, the cost is fracking \u2013 which involves pumping poisonous chemicals into the ground \u2013 and for many renewables such as wind-farms and tidal barrages, it is that they impinge on nature, and require great effort and resources to build and maintain. Why do we so rarely mention the most obvious path to energy sustainability, which would be to simply use drastically less energy? The problem seems to be that we love our gadgets, our cars, our cheap flights, our air-conditioned shopping experiences and our brightly lit cities so much that we can't bear to limit even a little of our out-of-control creature comforts.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong><br><em>Cologne, Germany</em></p> <p>\u2022 Simon Jenkins suggests we should draw inspiration from Dieter Helm's call for a dash for gas. Yet rises in the cost of gas have been responsible for more than 80% of the increase in consumer energy bills over the last five years. We have a fundamental choice about whether we want to build more energy or burn more energy. A recent study for E3G finds this relates not just to the volatile price of gas, but also to the risk of policy failure. Our analysis shows that if there is less energy efficiency, less CCS or less nuclear than the government is planning, then the cost of energy in a gas-heavy system could go up almost 100%. But if these policies fail under a renewables-heavy system, then the cost of energy to the consumer is likely to go up no more than 8%. The lesson is that gas is not a cheap option. A gas-based energy system carries a heavy risk of much higher costs for the consumer.<br><strong>Nick Mabey</strong><br><em>Chief executive, </em><a href=\"http://www.e3g.org/\" title=\"\"><em>E3G</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Why the excitement over rising energy prices? When most of our energy is derived from finite resources of gas, oil and coal, the cost is bound to increase as resources get stretched. The real scandal is that poor have to pay a higher price per unit than the rich. The utility companies usually start with a standing charge and then progressively reduce the cost per unit as consumption rises. What the government should do is ban standing charges \u2013 after all, we don't pay a standing charge to visit a petrol forecourt \u2013 and ideally insist that the cost goes up per unit as consumption increases. This would benefit the small careful user and would encourage the heavy user to be more prudent, making the raw materials last longer, while we build energy generators for the long-term.<br><strong>Chris Hooper</strong><br><em>Backwell, North Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 Wouldn't we all get cheaper energy bills if, instead of competing commercial firms, we had a single nationalised energy supply system (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Just like The Thick of It \u2013 PM firms up energy tariff plans</a>, 19 October)? Then, on top of the actual supply and administration costs, we wouldn't have to pay for competitive advertising, many separate administrative systems, \"churning\" costs, profits, dividends, directors' bonuses etc. Wouldn't this cut the cost by at least 15%? Competition between energy supply firms is a myth, as they all change their prices in similar fashion and the only competition seems to be between them as to who can make the most profit, not who can provide the cheapest and most efficient service.<br><strong>Michael Miller</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 I wonder if <a href=\"http://www.energy-uk.org.uk/press-releases/angela-knight-appointed-chief-executive-of-energy-uk.html\" title=\"\">Angela Knight</a> expected her new job, as chief apologist for the energy industry, to be a doddle compared to her last job, as chief apologist for the banking industry?<br><strong>Graham Jump</strong><br><em>Guildford, Surrey</em></p>",

Equal numbers of women and men are now saying they support Romney in the <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158048/romney-obama-among-likely-voters.aspx\">last</a> Gallup poll. This is a disaster because Democrats can only win with the traditional gender gap, which is usually in the double digits. </p> <p>The Romney team has managed rather brilliantly to obfuscate his position on every issue \u2013 very few women know that if you go to his website, you find out that he does not support a woman's right to abortion <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57501172/romney-my-views-on-abortion-rights-are-clear-/\">except</a> in cases of rape or incest. Ryan is even more drastic in his extremism: supporting ending Planned Parenthood, for instance \u2013 which provides health care to 3 million Americans \u2013 and in <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/14/1119867/-Rachel-Maddow-Welcome-Congressman-Ultrasound-Ryan-to-the-Republican-Ticket\">favor</a> of punitive transvaginal probes for women who dare to choose abortion. Women are not aware, I think, of how invasive the Republican agenda is for their most personal healthcare decisions. The paradox is that the Republican message of 'smaller government' (get the state out of schools, out of healthcare, out of welfare) is reversed in Romney's radical plan for the far right <em>vis a vis </em>women's most intimate reproductive rights decisions. (To see a satirical take on the GOP agenda, one can watch the hilarious yet also tragic <a href=\"http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/87be7156f5/republicans-get-in-my-vagina\">Funny or Die video</a>, \"Republicans, Get in my Vagina\".) </p> <p>As for Romney's first executive order, should he win the presidency, must be to close Guant\u00e1namo. His next policies should involve the repeal of the Patriot Act, the closing of the Department of Homeland Security and the demise of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act\">National Defense Authorization Act</a>.

So far, his understanding of women seems to center on his wife \u2013 instead of talking to us himself, he uses Ann as a sort of ambassador to a culture he clearly doesn't understand and doesn't particularly respect.</p> <p>He could speak to us directly about the economy and recognize that the recovery has disproportionately benefited men (even adjusting for the fact that job losses disproportionately impacted men). He could realize that we exist in our bodies, and the physical needs of 50% of the population aren't \"special\" or negligible. He could appreciate that we're a population as diverse as men, and that our interests extend beyond our roles as mothers and care-takers. And he could prove that he has, at any point, considered women to be equal players in society.</p> <p>Even his story (or \"<a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx#.UH6ge5hq8ng.facebook\">lie</a>\", as it's also known) at the last debate about soliciting \"binders full of women\" to fill cabinet positions is telling: A man who was a consultant and a businessman for decades didn't know <em>any</em> qualified women? That speaks volumes about his views on half the population, and those views are reflected in his strongly sexist policy positions.</p> <p>Other than the things he definitely <em>shouldn't</em> do that he's already pledged to do on his first day \u2013 overturning Obamacare and reinstituting the deadly <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/20/why_kenyan_women_fear_romney/\">Global Gag Rule</a> \u2013 I would love to see any president propose a Bill of Women's Rights, ensuring the basic things women require for equal participation in society: universal health care coverage (including contraception, abortion, pre-natal and well-baby care); equal pay; federally-mandated parental leave; subsidized high-quality childcare with well-paid workers and comprehensive assistance to low-income families. But that's about as likely as Romney legalizing the kind of drugs one would need to believe a \"pro-family, pro-life\" Republican president would support legislation that actually helps women, men, children and families live better lives. </p> <p><em>Jill Filipovic is a freelance writer and blogger at Feministe, and a practicing lawyer in New York City</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tamara-winfrey-harris\">Tamara Winfrey Harris</a>: 'Romney has learned little from leafing through binders of women'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169538\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/17/1326838687226/tamarawinfreyharris_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Tamara Winfrey Harris\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For female voters like me, a candidate's image comes as a result of actions. That is why there is very little Mitt Romney can do before election day to convince me that his presidency would be good for women. His actions tell me just the opposite. For instance, the candidate has pledged to defund Planned Parenthood; voiced support for the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/birth-control-exemption-bill-the-blunt-amendment-killed-in-senate/2012/03/01/gIQA4tXjkR_story.html\">Blunt Amendment</a>, a bill introduced to restrict access to birth control and said that he supports overturning Roe v Wade. For anyone concerned about reproductive healthcare, Romney's stance should chill the blood.</p> <p>But healthcare isn't the only area where Romney fails to demonstrate the love for the ladies his wife <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/29/ann_romney_love_mitt_please/\">crowed</a> about during the Republican National Convention. While advisers say that, as president, Romney would not repeal the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, he did <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/17/mitt-romney-lilly-ledbetter_n_1973446.html\">oppose</a> the measure when President Obama signed it in 2009, giving women better opportunity to sue over pay inequities. His running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan \u2013 the man Ledbetter herself says \"<a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/08/16/lilly-ledbetter-paul-ryan-scares-me-to-death/\">scares me to death</a>\" \u2013 opposed the Act.</p> <p>If his positions on women's bodies and our ability to work for fair pay are any indication, Romney has learned little from leafing through \"binders of women\".</p> <p>But perhaps the candidate's rhetoric does not reveal his true intentions. Maybe he's simply rallying his conservative base and a real Romney presidency wouldn't be so radical. The first 100 days of a Romney administration could be very enlightening. A clue as to his authentic objectives may come from what a President Romney doesn't do in its early days. As a candidate, Romney has pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act \"<a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2011/11/23/375846/romney-pledges-to-repeal-obamacare-on-day-one/?mobile=nc\">on day one</a>\", cutting off millions of women and families from preventative care and ending no-cost birth control benefits. Ignoring the hyperbole in the pronouncement (rolling back the Act wouldn't be that easy), keeping the Affordable Care Act intact and not working toward its demise would be a first step in convincing me that Mitt gives a whit about women.</p> <p><em>Tamara Winfrey Harris is a blogger on What Tami Said, and editor of New Demographic's Anti-Racist Parent</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/deedee-garc-a-blas\">DeeDee Garcia Blase</a>: '[Romney] will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169539\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/red/blue_pics/2011/10/26/deedeegarciablase_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"DeeDee Garcia Blase\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It will be very hard for Mitt Romney to improve his image with women voters because he has reversed his stance on the pro-choice/pro-life issue too many times. His reversals make him appear like a populist politician driven by polls. Remember, Romney gave an oath to protect a woman's right to choose until he decided to run under the Republican presidential ticket. How can a pro-choice woman trust Romney after he went back on his word? On the other hand, how can a pro-life woman trust him when his campaign recently stated that abortion \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/mitt-romney-abortion-ad_n_1972251.html\">should be an option</a>\" in certain cases?<br> In order for Romney to garner the trust of women voters, he will have to pick a side and stick with it to the end, else mistrust will continue to pile up. Right now, women do not know what his real conviction on the issue, and we become much more considerate of politicians who stick to their convictions. As it stands, we still do not know where his heart is really at. A woman has never served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS); therefore, any president promoting women to the JCS within his first 100 days would give many of us a sigh of relief and encouragement. So many women in the US are related to sons, daughters or relatives currently serving our armed forces, and we are feeling apprehensive and pressure with regard to the multiple wars we have been engaged in. It would be helpful knowing that more women are part of the \"advisory committee\", which helps plan joint operations and resolutions of military problems because, as it stands, there appears to be too much testosterone fueling those key decisions. It would be helpful for us to see balance at a strategic leadership level.</p> <p><em>DeeDee Garcia Blase is founder of Somos Republicans, and the president of the National Tequila Party Movement, which promotes Hispanic Get Out the Vote initiatives</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heidi-moore\">Heidi Moore</a>: 'it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398169540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/5/18/1337374473765/heidimoore_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Heidi Moore\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the current polls are to be believed, Mitt Romney is in line to draw the votes of roughly half the country.

Unfortunately, the conversation around women in the workplace still seems to center around the most pragmatic basics being treated as romantic political dreams. For instance, it's difficult to picture a woman who will rush to the polls, full of passionate vigor, in support of the idea that it' going to be possible for her to one day have a good day at work <em>and</em> get home in time to pitch in for dinner or tuck in her kids. So it may be useful for Governor Romney to get the basics out of the way: we know that corporations respond to tax breaks. Would they also respond to tax incentives for businesses that show they pay their women as equally as they do men? </p> <p>You have to start rebuilding the economy somewhere.

Romney has surged to an average 4-point lead in key swing states due in large part to women supporting him, thus sending the Obama campaign in hyperbole overdrive. The ensuing panic by the left has resulted in the ridiculous, patronizing \"War on Women\" meme, followed by the insulting, \"vote like your lady parts depend on it\" that served only to turn women off Obama and move towards Romney.</p> <p>So excuse me if I find the question posed as a bit biased since it is President Obama who needs to change his tune with women. Whatever Mitt Romney is doing to move women to his side, he should keep doing it! He is leading in the popular vote <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\">52% to 45%</a>, and for the first time in this campaign, now leads in the electoral college.</p> <p>While women in the Obama White House <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/10/17/fox-accuses-obama-of-pay-discrimination-to-defe/190722\">make less</a> than the men, as governor of Massachusetts, of Mitt Romney's 20 cabinet positions, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/10/17/women-including-ex-cabinet-members-rally-around-romney-binder-project/\">ten were held by women</a>.

It is my prediction, too, that Obama letting two high-ranking women in his administration, Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice, take the fall for his incompetency regarding the Benghazi attack that led to the murders of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans \u2013 and his subsequent cover-up \u2013 will heat up as an issue for women in these weeks before election day.</p> <p>That Obama and his cheerleaders in the media are overplaying their hand on the awkward \"binders\" phrasing as if it is a gaffe, is telling: Romney is trending upwards, and the Obama campaign has even had to abandon large chunks of their firewall strategy as Mitt Romney pulls close, even or ahead in states they thought were reliably Obama's. Once women <em>and</em> men got to see Mitt Romney in the debates without the biased media filter, they saw a man quite different than the one Obama and the left described. And they like him. Binders and binders full of women like and trust him. Obama is finding out the hard way that women vote with their brain and their wallets, and that's very bad news for him.</p> <p>A President Romney should repeat his stellar record of hiring women from his time as governor. And unlike President Obama, he can pay women what he pays the men, leading by example, whereas Barack Obama talks the talk, but won't walk the walk. Romney is also onto something big by pointedly addressing the growing number of women in poverty under Obama. His personal history of helping people combined with his business success and saving the Olympics can be put to good use by tackling this problem, rather than just putting more women on welfare and food stamps as has been the case in the Obama presidency. A President Romney should take the problem seriously. He would be a hero.</p> <p><em>Cher Jacobus is a Republican political strategist, pundit and writer</em></p>",
  "<p>Piracy in west Africa is reaching dangerous proportions, the global piracy watchdog has said, with the increase in attacks fuelled by Nigerian criminals.</p> <p>As efforts continue to rescue seven foreign workers kidnapped from a vessel off the coast of Nigeria earlier this week, the director of the international maritime bureau (IMB) warned that the region was now a major focal point for armed robberies at sea, and criticised the lack of efforts by governments in the region to tackle the problem.</p> <p>While Somalia has recorded a decline in hijackings in recent months, incidents are on the rise in west Africa, with 32 reported <a href=\"http://www.icc-ccs.org/news/747-six-month-drop-in-world-piracy-imb-report-shows\" title=\"\">by July this year. There were 25 in 2011</a>. In Nigeria alone there were 17 reports, compared with six in 2011, with particularly high levels of violence against crew members by pirates armed with guns.</p> <p>\"Piracy in west Africa is a serious problem,\" said Pottengal Mukundan, IMB director. \"Pirates are getting quite audacious, with increasing levels of violence being used.</p> <p>\"These attacks started off the coast of Nigeria, although they have also now spilled over into neighbouring countries. The problem has been there for a long time and authorities have had ample notice to deal with the problem. There is really no excuse for the fact that they have not been able to deal with it.\"</p> <p>The warning comes as seven foreigners working for French oil transport company Bourbon were kidnapped while boarding a vessel belonging to the company on Nigeria's Pennington river earlier this week.</p> <p>A statement on the company's website <a href=\"http://www.bourbon-online.com/en/news/2012/10/situation-in-nigeria-10-17-2012\" title=\"\">said that six Russians and one Estonian employed as crew members by the company were being held captive</a>, and that efforts were underway to obtain their release.</p> <p>\"The emergency unit set up immediately by Bourbon has been set up to aim at their rapid liberation under the safest security conditions,\" the statement said. \"Bourbon is in contact with the crew members' families, supporting them, and keeping them regularly informed.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Nigeria's Joint Military Task Force told the Guardian that joint military-naval operations were underway to catch the attackers, and confirmed that incidents of kidnapping and piracy were on the increase.</p> <p>\"The Bourbon vessel that was conveying the expatriates during the incidents has been recovered. We have forward operational bases in the Niger Delta and our maritime friends are at the moment conducting a search to track down the kidnappers. We are conducting a lot of intelligence gathering\" said Lt Col Oyeama Nwachukwu.</p> <p>Although the legal definition of piracy encompasses acts of violence on the high seas, rather than in territorial waters, the incident is one of a growing number linking thieves in Nigeria's Niger Delta, where hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil are stolen from pipelines each day, to increasingly bold attacks on ships.</p> <p>There are concerns that piracy in and around Nigeria could engulf the entire west African coastal region \u2013 known as the Gulf of Guinea \u2013 an increasingly busy maritime region and a major thoroughfare for valuable commodities such as oil, gold, bauxite and iron ore, and agricultural products.</p> <p>Although Nigeria's navy is regarded as relatively successful at tackling piracy off its own shores, experts say the problem has been pushed outwards to neighbouring countries who have little capacity for maritime law enforcement.</p> <p>Benin and Cameroon have both reported rises in piracy attacks, which experts attribute to Nigerian pirates.</p> <p>Benin \u2013 which depends on its port for around 40% of income \u2013 has asked the UN to send an international force to help police the coast in the region. Since being labelled a high-risk country by London-based marine insurers' group the Joint War Committee, the country has suffered a 70% fall in shipping resulting in an estimated \u00a350m ($81m) loss in customs revenue, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=un%20secretary%20general%20assessment%20mission%20piracy&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CC4QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.securitycouncilreport.org%2Fatf%2Fcf%2F%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D%2FGuinea%20S%202012%2045.pdf&amp;ei=c41AUOTNBtDNswbZuIC4CQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGa059ayt0PaHfRcbSElZOk2I3otw&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">according to a recent UN report</a>.</p> <p>The problem has led to calls for a regional taskforce and outside intervention to rival the Nato and EU-led efforts off the coast of Somalia.</p> <p>The US military said it was stepping up attempts to create a regional taskforce to deal with the problem of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.</p> <p>\"In the past, most of our efforts have been bilateral,\" US Africa Command head of air and maritime programmes told Reuters. \"Now we are focusing on a regional basis because the solution in regional.

  "<p>Leeds isn't short of a sporting hero or two; just a couple of months ago we celebrated the world class Olympic performances of boxer Nicola Adams, cyclist Lizzie Armitstead and triathlon stars&#xa0;Alistair and Jonny Brownlee. And while the sport of Thai Boxing might miss out on the global attention of the Olympics, it has a strong and growing following in and around West Yorkshire, with Leeds being home to some of the most talented Thai boxers - not just in the country - but in the world.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>This Saturday, 20 October, some of the most talented&#xa0;Thai boxers in the country will showcase exactly what it means to be a world-class athlete. The aptly named 'Xtreme Combat' Thai boxing show will be held this Saturday at Elland Road&#xa0;- the stomping ground of Leeds' football champions.<br>&#xa0;&#xa0;<br>Thai boxing veterans Mike Tobin of&#xa0;Tobin's Gym&#xa0;and Richard Smith of&#xa0;Bad Company&#xa0;- both in Leeds - have teamed up to bring together a fantastic line up of 14 show-stopping bouts, consisting of 2 European title fights and 4 international matches. Fighting for the prestigious European titles are Mikey Clarke and Stuart Kemp, both&#xa0;of Mike Tobin's Gym and both of whom have won British and European titles respectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398072246\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350671667413/Xtremeposter.jpg\" alt=\"thai boxing\" width=\"460\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Tobin and Smith, through hard work and dedication, have seen their fighters&#xa0;achieve world-wide acclaim (Richard Smith is responsible for training Liam Harrison, Jordan Watson and Andy Howson, all of whom between them&#xa0;have 8&#xa0;World Champion titles) and hope to make superstars out of the fighters they have chosen to put in the ring this weekend.&#xa0; Smith says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Fighters are born, not made, and we are so excited about these matches.&#xa0;This is definitely&#xa0;one of the most exciting Thai Boxing shows Leeds has ever seen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tobin adds: </p> <blockquote> <p>Leeds has some of the best Thai Boxers we've seen in the last 10 years. We have world champions right here on our very own doorstep.<br>&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p><br>As the momentum behind the show continues to grow, so too does the stage. Both instructors have seen their fighters&#xa0;compete up&#xa0;and down the country in some of the largest venues including the MEN Arena and the O2. They have seen their&#xa0;prot\u00e9g\u00e9es&#xa0;shoot to Thai Boxing fame with&#xa0;fighters competing&#xa0;overseas&#xa0;in New York, Vegas, Australia and all over Europe, not to mention their success being televised on Sky Sports - a sure sign that this sport is not one to be sniffed at.</p> <p>Some of the stars:<br>&#xa0;<br><strong><br>The World Champion: Liam 'The Hitman' Harrison&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>The stats: 87 fights, 75 wins, 2 draws,&#xa0;39 KO's.&#xa0;<br>&#xa0;<br>Titles: &#xa0;4 x World Champion,&#xa0;Intercontinental Champion,&#xa0;European Champion,&#xa0;British Champion,&#xa0;Commonwealth Champion.&#xa0;<br>&#xa0;<br>Liam Harrison, 27, from Harehills, is a World Champion of Thai boxing and trains with Bad Company.&#xa0;</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I train twice a day, every day, six days a week when I'm preparing for a fight. &#xa0;When you're fighting, you're only in the ring for fifteen minutes, but you have to train for hours and hours to be able to last those fifteen minutes.</p> <p>It's not a brutal sport - a lot of people look at it and think that but it's not. To me it's a game, it's just a game. Once you start being aggressive, you lose concentration and that's when you get knocked out. You've got to be sharp, you've got to be alert and you've got to keep a high level of concentration.</p> <p>\"It takes discipline to become a champion.

I would honestly be the last person ever who you would expect fight competitively, but after trying&#xa0;Thai boxing for fun I never looked back.<br>\"Some people don't understand why a girl would want to fight, but the win and all the training leading up to it is so enjoyable. It's the best feeling in the world.</p> <p>People often say I smile when I'm fighting, but I just enjoy being there and I enjoy people watching. It's not like you're trying to hurt the other person - it can be quite playful sometimes.</p> <p>I think every girl should try it. It's good for self defence, it's good for confidence and it's good for fitness and&#xa0;weight loss. It's such a friendly sport, too.&#xa0;There's a real community feel with all the different Thai boxing gyms in Leeds. All the clubs like to work together to get the best out of the fighters. I think Thai boxing is probably one of the more humble sports - there's a lot of respect in it.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>&#xa0;<strong><br>The Rising Star: Mikey Clarke</strong><br>&#xa0;<br>Stats: 21 fights, 21 wins, 17 KO's</p> <p>Titles: UKMF Champion,&#xa0;ISKA British Champion.<br>&#xa0;<br>With two titles already under his belt, 24-year-old Mikey, from Guisely, is the one to watch for the future of Thai Boxing. He trains at Tobin's Gym and is fighting this weekend.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's pretty full on with the training side of things - I train six days a week when I'm preparing for a fight.&#xa0;</p> <p>The weeks before a fight you can get a bit nervous and worried about whether or not you can beat your opponent, but when you're in the ring all you can think about it how much you want to win and it gives you confidence.</p> <p>I don't think Thai boxing is widely recognised enough - I'd like to increase the appeal of it as it's so much fun to watch. It's even great for families to come to see as there's so much respect in the sport. You're there to hurt each other in the ring, but afterwards you're best mates at the bar!</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br>The Newcomer: Lewis Kendrew&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Stats: 1 fight, 1 win.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>19-year-old Lewis from New Farnley has only been boxing for 3 years but has already shown much promise in the ring. He trains at Tobin's Gym and is fighting this weekend.</p> <p>I'm probably the least experienced fighter fighting this weekend, but I still wanted to take part - everyone's got to start somewhere. I'm probably more nervous this time to be honest than for my first fight as it's a bigger show.<br>&#xa0;<br>I'd encourage anyone to give it a go, even if they've never done it before. You don't have to take part in the fights - a lot of people just come down to train.

  "<p>The Kremlin launched a charm offensive aimed at persuading investors that BP's Russian interests would be safe with its national oil champion, Rosneft.</p> <p>Igor Shuvalov, deputy prime minister, said on Friday the government would consider further privatising the largely state-owned oil group next year, while Rosneft itself boasted of having \"dynamic\" potential.</p> <p>The moves came as the BP board met in London to consider a recommendation from the chief executive, Bob Dudley, that it agree a $26bn (\u00a316bn) cash and shares offer from Rosneft for its 50% stake in the Russian oil producer TNK-BP. Under the deal BP is expected take a stake of more than 15% in Rosneft plus more than $15bn in cash, part of which may be distributed as a special dividend.</p> <p>BP said it would make no statement until all the details had been clarified and signed off. There is an expectation that a formal agreement will come early next week.</p> <p>The company will still have to obtain various governmental approvals in Russia and may have to put the asset sale and share swap formally to investors in an extraordinary general meeting. That depends on a ruling from the UK listing authority but BP will be anxious to ensure that there is general support for the move anyway.</p> <p>\"For the TNK-BP sale we will of course discuss with the listing authority and comply with the relevant regulatory requirements at the right time to ensure we have the correct approvals, including shareholder approvals if necessary,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>Investors have been frustrated by the company's inability to raise its share price, which stubbornly remains 30% below its level before the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010. Some analysts have called for the company to be broken up to extract more stock market value from the business.</p> <p>The Russians are aware that BP investors \u2013 many of whom are based in the US \u2013 are sceptical about the operational performance of Rosneft and the political influence on it from Vladimir Putin's government.</p> <p>The Kremlin owns about three-quarters of Rosneft and has constantly talked about lowering its stake to 50% plus one share. The state was originally supposed to shed 15% this year but the plans were scrapped.</p> <p>Shuvalov told Russian news agencies that the government would consider selling a stake in 2013 and 2014, depending on market conditions. Rosneft managers and officials agree on the need to pick \"the best time\" to sell and find a \"quality investor\", he said.</p> <p>Shuvalov declined to comment directly on the Rosneft offer to buy BP's half of TNK-BP and the other 50% owned by Russian oligarchs, who make up the Alfa Access Renova consortium.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Rosneft representatives in London were busy sending briefing notes describing its structure (of part state energy company and part global corporation) as \"unique\", with production levels higher than Norway.</p> <p>It claimed that state involvement reduced investment risks associated with long-term projects and enabled \"responsible access\" to the Russian Arctic and other offshore opportunities.</p> <p>\"As a public corporation, Rosneft's main strategy is to create value for shareholders making management very commercially focused,\" it said, while claiming that it had increased production more than tenfold in a decade.</p> <p>But while Rosneft and the Kremlin were playing up the opportunities for BP, in Russia there was some criticism that a full takeover of TNK would strip the country's strategic oil sector of competition and efficiency.</p> <p>Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister and now an opposition leader, said: \"This is the restart of a process of renationalisation of the oil industry, which was suspended several years ago.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, in an apparently unrelated incident, a manager at TNK-BP has been arrested on suspicion of fraud. The interior ministry said in a statement that the suspect, who had previously worked in the Irkutsk regional government, had in September offered jobs in the Kremlin to two businessmen in return for payments of $3m apiece.</p> <p>Executives at TNK-BP have in the past had run-ins with Russian law enforcement at times of shareholder friction, with two managers arrested in 2008 amid a dispute over strategy that forced Dudley, then chief executive of TNK-BP, to flee Russia.</p>",
  "<p>'Ten years and seven months.\" Janis Sharp leans in over a small, round table piled with newspapers. The table, on which there is also a bouquet of flowers, is set next to a picture window that looks out on to a generous garden, where a cat prowls and a fish pond bubbles, and the late afternoon sun streams through the trees. The scene is so bucolic that it takes a little while to notice the old laptop that hums, slowly overheating, in front of the sofa on the other side of the room. This is the laptop in front of which she has spent most of those 10 years and seven months, writing letters, petitions, learning the law on extradition, searching for persuasive parallel cases to that of her son, Gary McKinnon, the computer hacker wanted for extradition to the US; it's also how she taught herself about Asperger's, the condition she only&#xa0;discovered he had when he appeared on TV in 2008 and scores of people wrote in, diagnosing him. Looking over at that side of the room, one can almost feel the accretion of hours spent tapping away, the winter dawns when she rose in terror in the dark, and started writing letters, \"and at&#xa0;two in the morning I'd still be there writing to people, but it helped\".</p> <p>It certainly did. On Tuesday home secretary Theresa May stood at the dispatch box and announced that after&#xa0;reviewing the evidence she had&#xa0;concluded \"that Mr McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr McKinnon's human rights\". She further announced that she&#xa0;would be introducing a \"forum bar\": \"where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so\". It is now up&#xa0;to the CPS to decide whether and how McKinnon will be tried here.</p> <p>Janis Sharp has never claimed her son&#xa0;is innocent. She does dispute, however, that his actions \u2013 &#xa0;described as a fishing expedition for \"little green men\" \u2013 constitute, in the words of a US prosecutor, \"the biggest military hack of all time\". She does a&#xa0;lot&#xa0;of disputing, for someone who says&#xa0;she is essentially shy. Fact after fact, delivered at speed, in her clear Glaswegian accent, case after case \u2013 extraditions stayed, or not stayed, and&#xa0;if&#xa0;they were stayed, whether there were friends in high places; hackers who have Asperger's, famous people who have children who have Asperger's, and have given her advice, explaining her own son to her. \"When I'm in a corner, I&#xa0;fight, and that's basically it.\"</p> <p>Fighting because you're cornered is one thing, but fighting such outsize opponents \u2013 the British establishment, the US government? \"I'm not scared of them. I don't really believe in hierarchy. I mean, I'd argue with the QC, I would argue if I thought someone was wrong. I&#xa0;respect people for what kind of person they are, how good they are \u2013 not what position they happen to be in. Respect is&#xa0;earned,\" she says, laughing. \"[I&#xa0;believe in] a spiritual hierarchy, rather than the other one.\"</p> <p>Sharp grew up in Glasgow. Her mother was a buyer for a department store, and her father, a telecommunications engineer, came from Stornoway, where his family spoke only Gaelic, and worked on the land. \"They were brought up raising and killing animals, so I say, 'Oh, where did I come from?'\" \u2013 she and her second husband, Wilson Sharp, are strict vegetarians. She left school at 15, was married four days after her 16th birthday and gave birth to Gary when she was 17. He spoke at 10 months, and was discussing the stars and planets by the time he was two years old. Generally placid, he screamed inconsolably whenever he was on a bus. \"It's an Asperger's thing \u2013 a terror of travel is what it is, but I didn't know that then.\"</p> <p>When Gary was six, she and her new&#xa0;husband moved to Crouch End in&#xa0;north London, and spent the next few&#xa0;decades gigging all over the city, calling themselves Axess, and then Who's George?, under which name they recorded a couple of singles at Abbey Road; they bought a recording studio, and made a living recording other bands. They used to buy and sell antiques, too, and write and illustrate children's books, but they haven't done&#xa0;any of this for the last seven years; they simply haven't had time. As for Gary, who used to sing and&#xa0;write his own music, \"Gary hasn't touched an instrument for years. He&#xa0;said he couldn't, because of the feelings it would bring up \u2013 he couldn't cope with it. He's so raw, and he shut himself down so completely that it would open everything up \u2013 and how can you&#xa0;deal with that?\"</p> <p>He was an unusual child, but then, they were an unusual family. \"He's among very eccentric people who are musicians and artists; we have friends who talk about their past lives as though they happened last week, so Gary was just more eccentric. Same reason we have animals that are considered difficult, or if we foster children that are considered difficult.\" She and Wilson have often fostered, on an emergency basis, older children or sibling groups; Janis \u2013 no surprise here \u2013 would often argue fiercely with their social workers over their rights. \"I don't find them difficult. I&#xa0;just loved Gary, but he was very different, and there were lots of things that were difficult for him.\"</p> <p>When he was nine, he went out and&#xa0;bought a book on body language. \"And we thought, 'What on earth are you doing? Body language?' We didn't realise he didn't recognise facial expressions.\" She and Wilson have spent a lifetime trying to protect him, and others, from the consequences of&#xa0;this, and of his impulse to tell the truth, regardless of the fallout. \"If someone says to Gary, 'Do I look fat?' he'd say, 'Yes.' I'd actually say to him, 'You can't say that,' and he'd&#xa0;say, 'Why?'&#xa0;I said, 'Because you're offending them,' and he said, \"but I'd rather know&#xa0;if I asked; they're asking because they want to know.' I said, 'No,&#xa0;they don't really want to know. They want&#xa0;reassurance.'\"</p> <p>She laughs, but she obviously carries a good deal of sadness about what she could not see about her son, because she did not know to look. For instance, she did not find out, until the Cambridge psychopathologist Simon Baron-Cohen started working with Gary, that he had been severely bullied at a school. \"Part of it was my fault, because I would see a jumper and say, 'Oh, I'll get that jumper \u2013 that would look nice on Gary,' and somebody at school would say, 'That comes from a women's shop.' It was fine, but kids are cruel.\"</p> <p>He was expelled from junior school. He would be disciplined for being \"dreamy and coming late and not come in [at all] some days\". At 16 he had what&#xa0;she describes as a \"meltdown\" so serious \u2013 he stopped being able to speak, to function at all, and collapsed twice on&#xa0;tube platforms \u2013 that they thought he had a brain tumour, and took him to a neurologist, who discovered nothing.</p> <p>\"I've found out what it is since then,\" she says \u2013 it was that same terror of travel, compounded by the fact that \"he&#xa0;was going into town in London to work as a trainee hairdresser and it was&#xa0;the first time he'd actually left everything he knew, and people with Asperger's can't do that; they never live on their own, that's how they are\".</p> <p>When, one morning in 2002, he called&#xa0;her and said that he had just had a&#xa0;four-hour interview at the police station about hacking US government computers, she was both furious, and immediately, totally scared. Furious because, \"I said, 'Why the heck didn't you ring me? I've told you your entire life, if you ever get in trouble, you ring me and I get a lawyer.' But he didn't, because they were a hi-tech crime unit, 'Computer people, just like me.'\" And&#xa0;scared, of course, because it was America, and not long after 9/11.</p> <p>There followed a period of almost phoney war when nothing much happened. \"I didn't realise they were waiting for this treaty to come in where you didn't need any evidence.\" Then on 7 October 2004, the US government filed a request for Gary's extradition, and on 7&#xa0;June 2005 he was arrested.</p> <p>Their lives changed completely. She and Wilson, who were living in Enfield, sold their home in order to access the equity. Gary stayed in north London where he lived with his girlfriend. (Wilson notes, quietly, that May's decision came in the nick of time: despite help from people such as David&#xa0;Gilmour, who paid, among other things, McKinnon's psychiatry bills, they are running out of money).</p> <p>And they fought and fought. How did she keep going? Did she ever feel like giving up? \"I always believed it'd work; I&#xa0;knew Gary wasn't going. I just knew he couldn't go, that it couldn't happen. But yeah, you have very upset times and every night you go to bed you're in terror. And every morning you wake up&#xa0;with that feeling in the pit of your stomach all the time. I'm the most optimistic person you could come across normally, but all the time I&#xa0;had&#xa0;this fear, and it's awfully hard to&#xa0;always have that.\"</p> <p>Did she ever go to professionals for&#xa0;help for herself? \"No, no, no; I&#xa0;don't&#xa0;go to the doctors and I don't take&#xa0;medication.\" \"She says it hasn't affected her health, but she does get stressed,\" says Wilson, later. \"Nothing you could put a frame around and hang&#xa0;on the wall, but \u2013 she's still my&#xa0;lovely Janis.\" A pause, thinking. \"She drinks more tea.\"</p> <p>She says she had to keep strong for everyone else: Gary's father was so upset that his sons by his second marriage were terrified he might die. \"Wilson was always feeling stressed \u2013 I&#xa0;was really worried, I thought, 'God, am I going, at the end of this, to lose Wilson to a heart attack or stroke?'\" She looks at him, fondly. Their relationship seems tender, obviously caring. Wilson kept her going. \"He&#xa0;feeds me \u2013 he cooks amazing food. He gives me tea, he looks after me.\"</p> <p>And strong for Gary himself, of course, who, whenever they lost an appeal, shut down completely, sitting for hours in the dark with his cats. At these times, the fear of extradition was&#xa0;combined, for her, with a total and well-founded fear that he would kill himself, which was, for him, an entirely logical response to the problem. He told Baron-Cohen that once, after he had been drinking \u2013 he had never drunk before he was charged \u2013 he woke to find&#xa0;himself in a bath with a knife next&#xa0;to him. Another time, Janis found chemicals often used in suicides in his&#xa0;house. From then on, he was in effect on suicide watch. Janis organised it so that someone \u2013 herself, another relative, or his girlfriend, Lucy&#xa0;(a charity worker who began as his&#xa0;carer; nearly 40, she would love to have children) \u2013 was there with him, every hour of the day or night.</p> <p>Janis would sit and talk to her son about his cats, which he loves, about music, about anything but the case or the fact that he'd been unable to work for a decade. Then when she got up to leave, she would \"see the tears in his eyes and I would start making excuses to stay longer, but it was getting worse and worse and worse and worse. You're so scared that you would lose him when you feel that you've still got it in your grasp to stop it.\"</p> <p>And now, against all the immense odds, she has succeeded. She has stopped it. One suspects it will require an entirely different kind of strength to&#xa0;pick up the pieces \u2013 her son was so overwhelmed by Tuesday's news he literally could not speak \u2013 but in the meantime Janis glows with nothing but&#xa0;relief.</p>",

  "<p>To Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Briana Mihok is gold dust. She ticks the three boxes that qualify her to be exactly the type of voter the presidential candidates are focusing all their attention on as the White House race enters its final three weeks. She is undecided, she lives in an unexpectedly competitive state and \u2013 by far the most important of all \u2013 Mihok is a woman.</p> <p>Presidential elections always come down to a narrow territorial battle for advantage in a handful of swing states. But after almost a year of constant campaigning and millions of dollars of television advertising, it became clear this week that both candidates believe that the defining battle of 2012 is now for female voters. </p> <p>At the second presidential debate on Tuesday night on Long Island, Obama and Romney clashed repeatedly on women's issues, ranging from workplace equality to access to contraception. Romney said women had suffered worse under Obama's economic policies, while the president in turn tied issues like equal pay and healthcare to economic recovery, describing women as important breadwinners in their family. </p> <p>A look at the polls over the last two weeks explains why. Since the first debate, Romney, whose campaign had been faltering, has surged back into contention, <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\">overtaking Obama in some national polls</a>. Behind those headline figures is the first sign of a big shift among women, with Obama's massive advantage cut back to a few points. </p> <p>But for some of the women whose votes the campaigns so openly covet, the sudden intensity of these arguments has done little to clarify matters. </p> <p>Mihok, a mother of one and registered Republican, said she was struck by Romney's ignorance of issues that concern women during Tuesday's debate. </p> <p>She cited the answer he gave to a question about workplace equality in which he said he understood the need to be \"flexible\" in order to have women in the workforce. Giving the example of his chief of staff, who had two children of school age, Romney told the audience at Hofstra university: \"She said: 'I can't be here until 7 or 8 o'clock at night: I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.' So we said: 'Fine. Let's have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you.'\"</p> <p>Romney's comments were \"weird\", said Mihok, a 32-year-old policy analyst for a non-profit research company at the University of Pittsburgh. She has been leaning towards Obama in recent weeks.</p> <p>\"My husband and I both work, and flexible work hours are just as important to my husband as they are to me,\" she said. \"Unfortunately governor Romney showed a real ignorance when it comes to women's issues.\"</p> <p>Mihok, who did not watch Tuesday's debate but discussed it with friends and read about it afterwards, said Obama put forward a better case for women. \"President Obama, with his background and his upbringing, has the opportunity to see first hand what is important to women and their families. Look at the statement about his grandmother training men for positions for which men got higher pay and better promoted, yet she never had that opportunity. That legacy is still around, and it's important to recognise that.\"</p> <p>But while that's good news for Obama, Mihok said women's issues would not be at the front of her mind when she came to cast her ballot on 6 November.</p> <p>She is not alone. Mihok is one of a number of undecided female voters from Pennsylvania whom the Guardian is talking to over the course of the election <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/11/pennsylvania-women-romney-obama\">to find out what is important to them</a>. None of them cited equal pay or social issues as top of the list of things important to their vote, although three out of five cited affordable healthcare as ranking top alongside the economy. </p> <p>\"Who can say what women need or want?\" said Judy Beck, 52, a grandmother and divorced mother of three from O'Hara township in Allegheny County. \"We are really just people.\"</p> <p>The issues most important to Beck's vote are the economy, foreign policy and the partisan makeup of Congress, but she said she did not hear anything on any of these issues that would make her change her mind, she said.</p> <p>Shireen Parsons, 68, a grandmother and community organiser from Summit Hill, Carbon County, was also unconvinced by the efforts to appeal to women. \"I'm old and cranky and sceptical,\" said Parsons, an independent. \"Women voters are smarter than most politicians think. When Romney talked about women, just how many women did he have in his cabinet? I've no idea but I would like to know.\"</p> <h2>'What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?'</h2> <p>Pennsylvania is typically Democratic but the race for its 20 electoral college votes has tightened considerably since the first debate. </p> <p>It has a particularly marked gender divide among voters, as well as a higher pay disparity among men and women. Women earn almost 81\u00a2 to a male worker's dollar, compared to the national average of 82\u00a2.</p> <p>Of the five women, three are Republican, one is a Democrat and one an independent. In the last two weeks, one of the Republicans has decided to vote for Obama, with another two leaning that way. But this week, the Democrat said she is leaning heavily towards Romney.</p> <p>Beck, who is \"principally a Republican\" because of her belief in less government, has made up her mind to vote for Obama over the course of the campaign.</p> <p>She said that the most recent arguments over women from the candidates has \"solidified my leaning towards the Obama campaign\".</p> <p>\"Obama didn't get as specific as Mitt Romney. Romney was too specific and it was apparent he doesn't have a clue. Obama mentioned his mother was a single mother, and he understands there are single mothers who need to make a living and that both men and women need to work.\"</p> <p>Obama answered the equal pay question during Tuesday's debate by referring to his upbringing by a single mother and grandmother who trained men for jobs that paid them more and ranked them higher. He cited the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which makes it easier for women to sue over pay discrimination, as one of his first official acts in office. And he cited childcare tax credits as a factor in whether women can become the breadwinners.</p> <p>\"These are not just women's issues,\" the president said. \"These are family issues. These are economic issues. And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates and women are getting the same fair deal as men are.\"</p> <p>These comments chimed with the Pennsylvania women. Romney's answer to the same question was to insist that his record when governor or Massachusetts was one of equality. His description of his efforts to hire women into his cabinet <a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">were pilloried as wrong-footed and false</a>, and he has been widely ridiculed for his \"binders full of women\" remark about female appointments to his cabinet.</p> <p>Beck said that Romney reminds her of an old boss who refused her a raise because he told her \"the married men need it first\".</p> <p>\"That was back in 1987,\" she said. \"It was wrong then, and it is so much more wrong now. Any suggestion that a woman should be paid any differently is ridiculous. What decade does Mitt Romney think he's living in?</p> <p>\"Romney does not like anyone to disagree with him, You need to be the president but you also need to listen to advice. It seems to me he assumes he has all the answers.\"</p> <p>Like Beck, Parsons said she found herself being more sceptical of Romney than Obama. </p> <p>\"Romney believes that life begins at conception, but he said he wouldn't legislate against a woman's right to abortion. I don't believe that,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Because of Obama's upbringing and who he is and also because of his wife, he tends to do better among women. I'm inclined to trust some things that Obama says than anything Mitt Romney says. I'm not sure why.</p> <p>\"On the other hand I see what Obama has failed to do for women at the bottom layer. He is as much owned by corporate interests as other politicians. They work for corporate interests and leave poor people women and children at the bottom of the heap.\"</p> <p>Joanne Quinn-Smith, 63, a talkshow host, publisher of an online news network and CEO of a marketing company, praised Obama for talking about women as breadwinners. \"If I work as hard as a man I want to get paid like a man,\" she said. </p> <p>She also pointed out the gender pay disparity in Pennsylvania, but said the economy was her number one concern. </p> <p>\"I want someone who can bring us out of this (recession),\" she said. \"Someone who wants to drive business or someone who wants to drive spending that is supported by taxes? I think I just told you where I am leaning. Someone needs to say: 'We've spent enough money, let's re-organise, let's tighten our belts.' Who is better to do that than someone from a business environment?\"</p> <p>Quinn-Smith said that she thought that Romney would be successful in gaining votes among women in higher income brackets.</p> <p>But, despite leaning towards the Republican, she is still not sure. \"In the last Guardian piece someone said, it is about who you hate less.\"</p> <p>She compared the election to a college student \"going home for the weekend and talking to your parents for advice, and you need them to say something wonderful about what's going on and you don't feel any better because you haven't gotten it.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the late summer of 2008, two&#xa0;events in quick succession signalled the end of the New World Order. In August, the US&#xa0;client state of Georgia was crushed in a brief but bloody war&#xa0;after it attacked Russian troops in the contested territory of South Ossetia.</p> <p>The former Soviet republic was a favourite of Washington's neoconservatives. Its authoritarian president had been lobbying hard for Georgia to join Nato's eastward expansion. In an unblinking inversion of reality, US vice-president Dick Cheney denounced Russia's response as an act of \"aggression\" that \"must not go unanswered\". Fresh from unleashing a catastrophic war on Iraq, George Bush declared Russia's \"invasion of a sovereign state\" to be \"unacceptable in the 21st century\".</p> <p>As the fighting ended, Bush warned Russia not to recognise South Ossetia's independence. Russia did exactly that, while US warships were reduced to sailing around the Black Sea. The conflict marked an international turning point. The US's bluff had been called, its military sway undermined by the war on&#xa0;terror, Iraq and Afghanistan. After two decades during which it bestrode the world like a colossus, the years of uncontested US power were over.</p> <p>Three weeks later, a second, still more far-reaching event threatened the heart of the US-dominated global financial system. On 15 September, the credit crisis finally erupted in the collapse of America's fourth-largest investment bank. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers engulfed the western world in its deepest economic crisis since the 1930s.</p> <p>The first decade of the 21st century shook the international order, turning the received wisdom of the global elites on its head \u2013 and 2008 was its watershed. With the end of the cold war, the great political and economic questions had all&#xa0;been settled, we were told. Liberal democracy and free-market capitalism had triumphed. Socialism had been consigned to history. Political controversy would now be confined to culture wars and tax-and-spend trade-offs.</p> <p>In 1990, George Bush Senior had inaugurated a New World Order, based&#xa0;on uncontested US military supremacy and western economic dominance. This was to be a unipolar world without rivals. Regional powers would bend the knee to the new worldwide imperium. History itself, it&#xa0;was said, had come to an end.</p> <p>But between the attack on the Twin Towers and the fall of Lehman Brothers, that global order had crumbled. Two factors were crucial. By the end of a decade of continuous warfare, the US had succeeded in exposing the limits, rather than the extent, of its military power. And the neoliberal capitalist model that had reigned supreme for a generation had crashed.</p> <p>It was the reaction of the US to 9/11 that broke the sense of invincibility of the world's first truly global empire. The Bush administration's wildly miscalculated response turned the atrocities in New York and Washington into the most successful terror attack in history.</p> <p>Not only did Bush's war fail on its own terms, spawning terrorists across the world, while its campaign of killings, torture and kidnapping discredited Western claims to be guardians of human rights. But the US-British invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq revealed the inability of the global behemoth to impose its will on subject&#xa0;peoples prepared to fight back.&#xa0;That became a strategic defeat for&#xa0;the US and its closest allies.</p> <p>This passing of the unipolar moment was the first of four decisive changes that transformed the world \u2013 in some crucial ways for the better. The second was the fallout from the crash of 2008 and the crisis of the western-dominated capitalist order it unleashed, speeding up relative US decline.</p> <p>This was a crisis made in America and&#xa0;deepened by the vast cost of its multiple wars. And its most devastating impact was on those economies whose elites had bought most enthusiastically into the neoliberal orthodoxy of deregulated financial markets and unfettered corporate power.</p> <p>A voracious model of capitalism forced down the throats of the world as the only way to run a modern economy, at a cost of ballooning inequality and environmental degradation, had been discredited \u2013 and only rescued from collapse by the greatest state intervention in history. The baleful twins of neoconservatism and neoliberalism had been tried and tested to destruction.</p> <p>The failure of both accelerated the rise of China, the third epoch-making change of the early 21st century. Not only did the country's dramatic growth take hundreds of millions out of poverty, but its state-driven investment model rode out the west's slump, making a mockery of market orthodoxy and creating a new centre of global power. That increased the freedom of manoeuvre for smaller states.</p> <p>China's rise widened the space for the&#xa0;tide of progressive change that swept Latin America \u2013 the fourth global advance. Across the continent, socialist and social-democratic governments were propelled to power, attacking economic and racial injustice, building regional independence and taking back resources from corporate control. Two&#xa0;decades after we had been assured there could be no alternatives to neoliberal capitalism, Latin Americans were creating them.</p> <p>These momentous changes came, of&#xa0;course, with huge costs and qualifications. The US will remain the overwhelmingly dominant military power for the foreseeable future; its partial defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan were paid for in death and destruction on a colossal scale; and multipolarity brings its own risks of conflict. The neoliberal model was discredited, but governments tried to refloat it through savage austerity programmes. China's success was bought at a high price in inequality, civil rights and environmental destruction. And Latin America's US-backed elites remained determined to reverse the social gains, as they succeeded in doing by violent coup in Honduras in 2009. Such contradictions also beset the revolutionary upheaval that engulfed the Arab world in 2010-11, sparking another shift of global proportions.</p> <p>By then, Bush's war on terror had become such an embarrassment that the&#xa0;US government had to change its&#xa0;name to \"overseas contingency operations\". Iraq was almost universally acknowledged to have been a disaster, Afghanistan a doomed undertaking. But&#xa0;such chastened realism couldn't be further from how these campaigns were regarded in the western mainstream when they were first unleashed.</p> <p>To return to what was routinely said by British and US politicians and their tame pundits in the aftermath of 9/11 is&#xa0;to be transported into a parallel universe of toxic fantasy. Every effort was made to discredit those who rejected the case for invasion and occupation \u2013 and would before long be&#xa0;comprehensively vindicated.</p> <p>Michael Gove, now a Tory cabinet minister, poured vitriol on the Guardian for publishing a full debate on the attacks, denouncing it as a \"Prada-Meinhof gang\" of \"fifth columnists\". Rupert Murdoch's Sun damned those warning against war as \"anti-American propagandists of the fascist left\". When the Taliban regime was overthrown, Blair issued a triumphant condemnation of those (myself included) who had opposed the invasion of Afghanistan and war on terror. We had, he declared, \"proved to be wrong\".</p> <p>A decade later, few could still doubt that it was Blair's government that had \"proved to be wrong\", with catastrophic consequences. The US and its allies would fail to subdue Afghanistan, critics&#xa0;predicted. The war on terror would itself spread terrorism. Ripping up civil rights would have dire consequences \u2013 and an occupation of Iraq would be a blood-drenched disaster.</p> <p>The war party's \"experts\", such as the&#xa0;former \"viceroy of Bosnia\" Paddy Ashdown, derided warnings that invading Afghanistan would lead to a \"long-drawn-out guerrilla campaign\" as&#xa0;\"fanciful\". More than 10 years on, armed resistance was stronger than ever&#xa0;and the war had become the longest in American history.</p> <p>It was a similar story in Iraq \u2013 though opposition had by then been given voice by millions on the streets. Those who stood against the invasion were still accused of being \"appeasers\". US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld predicted the war would last six days. Most of the Anglo-American media expected resistance to collapse in short order. They were entirely wrong.</p> <p>A new colonial-style occupation of Iraq would, I wrote in the first week of&#xa0;invasion, \"face determined guerrilla resistance long after Saddam Hussein has gone\" and the occupiers \"be driven&#xa0;out\". British troops did indeed face unrelenting attacks until they were&#xa0;forced out in 2009, as did US regular troops until they were withdrawn in 2011.</p> <p>But it wasn't just on the war on terror&#xa0;that opponents of the New World Order were shown to be right and its cheerleaders to be talking calamitous nonsense. For 30 years, the west's elites&#xa0;insisted that only deregulated markets, privatisation and low taxes on&#xa0;the wealthy could deliver growth and&#xa0;prosperity.</p> <p>Long before 2008, the \"free market\" model had been under fierce attack: neoliberalism was handing power to unaccountable banks and corporations, anti-corporate globalisation campaigners argued, fuelling poverty and social injustice and eviscerating democracy \u2013 and was both economically and ecologically unsustainable.</p> <p>In contrast to New Labour politicians who claimed \"boom and bust\" to be a thing of the past, critics dismissed the idea that the capitalist trade cycle could be abolished as absurd. Deregulation, financialisation and the reckless promotion of debt-fuelled speculation would, in fact, lead to crisis.</p> <p>The large majority of economists who predicted that the neoliberal model was heading for breakdown were, of course, on the left. So while in Britain the main political parties all backed \"light-touch regulation\" of finance, its opponents had long argued that City liberalisation threatened the wider economy.</p> <p>Critics warned that privatising public services would cost more, drive down pay and conditions and fuel corruption. Which is exactly what happened. And in the European Union, where corporate privilege and market orthodoxy were embedded into treaty, the result was ruinous. The combination of liberalised banking with an undemocratic, lopsided and deflationary currency union that critics (on both left and right in this case) had always argued risked breaking apart was a disaster waiting to happen. The crash then provided the trigger.</p> <p>The case against neoliberal capitalism had been overwhelmingly made on the left, as had opposition to the US-led wars of invasion and occupation. But it was strikingly slow to capitalise on its vindication over the central controversies of the era. Hardly surprising, perhaps, given the loss of confidence that flowed from the left's 20th-century defeats \u2013 including in its own social alternatives.</p> <p>But driving home the lessons of these disasters was essential if they were not to be repeated. Even after Iraq and Afghanistan, the war on terror was pursued in civilian-slaughtering drone attacks from Pakistan to Somalia. The western powers played the decisive role in the overthrow of the Libyan regime \u2013 acting in the name of protecting civilians, who then died in their thousands in a Nato-escalated civil war, while conflict-wracked Syria was threatened with intervention and Iran with all-out attack.</p> <p>And while neoliberalism had been discredited, western governments used&#xa0;the crisis to try to entrench it. Not&#xa0;only were jobs, pay and benefits cut as never before, but privatisation was extended still further. Being right was, of course, never going to be enough. What was needed was political and social pressure strong enough to turn the tables of power.</p> <p>Revulsion against a discredited elite&#xa0;and its failed social and economic project steadily deepened after 2008. As&#xa0;the burden of the crisis was loaded on to the majority, the spread of protests, strikes and electoral upheavals demonstrated that pressure for real change had only just begun. Rejection of&#xa0;corporate power and greed had become the common sense of the age.</p> <p>The historian Eric Hobsbawm described the crash of 2008 as a \"sort of right-wing equivalent to the fall of the Berlin wall\". It was commonly objected that after the implosion of communism and traditional social democracy, the left had no systemic alternative to offer. But no model ever came pre-cooked. All&#xa0;of them, from Soviet power and the Keynesian welfare state to Thatcherite-Reaganite neoliberalism, grew out of ideologically driven improvisation in specific historical circumstances.</p> <p>The same would be true in the aftermath of the crisis of the neoliberal order, as the need to reconstruct a broken economy on a more democratic, egalitarian and rational basis began to dictate the shape of a sustainable alternative. Both the economic and ecological crisis demanded social ownership, public intervention and a shift of wealth and power. Real life was pushing in the direction of progressive solutions.</p> <p>The upheavals of the first years of the 21st century opened up the possibility of&#xa0;a new kind of global order, and of genuine social and economic change. As&#xa0;communists learned in 1989, and the&#xa0;champions of capitalism discovered 20 years later, nothing is ever settled.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from The Revenge of History: the Battle for the 21st Century by Seumas Milne, published by Verso.

Uncles has so far refused to take the post off his website despite threats of legal action.</p> <p>And on Thursday, environmentalists at a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/18/protest-george-osborne-green-economy\" title=\"\">Stop Climate Chaos demonstration at the Treasury</a> were met with Nazi salutes by an even smaller counter-protest organised by a group called <a href=\"http://repealtheact.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Repeal the Act</a>. In later email correspondence, Repeal the Act referred to the protesters as \"Nazis\".</p> <p>Yesterday, four leading environmentalists, Andy Atkins, the director of Friends of the Earth; John Sauven of Greenpeace; Mike Clarke of the RSPB and David Nussbaum of WWF-UK, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/green-groups-hit-out-at-osbornes-taliban-tag-8217387.html\" title=\"\">wrote to Osborne seeking an explanation for the insult he is said to have used</a>. In a short letter, they asked him to clarify his remarks and urged him to specify exactly who they referred to. Craig Bennett, policy director at Friends of the Earth, sums up the issue:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In the last few days we have had the chief whip calling police 'plebs' and now the chancellor calling environmentalists the Taliban. It's water off a duck's back, but people around the world are being murdered for fighting for the environment. For Osborne to even quip like this is outrageous. When a senior politician does this, it indicates acceptability. That is scandalous.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>A day after<strong> Google</strong> suffered the biggest share price drop in history, there was little respite for the search engine's investors.</p> <p>Some \u00a315bn was wiped off Google's value on Thursday after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/18/google-shares-suspend-email-22bn\" title=\"\">the accidental release of its third quarter results ahead of time.</a> Google - which had recently overtaken Microsoft to become the second largest US technology company after Apple - blamed financial printing firm R.R. Donnelley for the mistake.</p> <p>More to the point, the figures showed a 20% fall in quarterly net income to $2.18bn and missed analysts' expectations. Part of the problem is that Google has been struggling to turn around loss-making mobile phone group Motorola Mobility which it bought for $12.5bn.</p> <p>In early trading on Friday, the company's shares had lost another 2% to $681.</p> <p>Google was one of a number of major US companies to report disappointing results, with others including Microsoft, General Electric and Intel. So Wall Street celebrated the 25th anniversary of the October 1987 crash with an early decline of more than 130 points, as the corporate news outweighed earlier positive US economic data such as retail sales and industrial production.</p> <p>Leading shares in London followed Wall Street's lead, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finishing 20.90 points lower at 5896.15. But over the week it added 103 points and touched a seven month high on Thursday. Investors had been cautiously optimistic in the run-up to the latest two day EU summit which ended on Friday afternoon, encouraged by news that Moody's had decided not to cut its credit rating on Spain. But despite late night meetings, the summit failed to produce any real breakthroughs.</p> <p>Banks came under pressure following one EU agreement, a compromise deal on banking supervision. More immediately, investors in the sector were nervous about increases in the compensation bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance, after <strong>Barclays</strong> raised its provision by another \u00a3700m to \u00a32bn on Thursday. The total cost could now reach \u00a315bn, said analysts.</p> <p>Barclays shares had been buoyed recently after strong performances from US investment banks. It said despite the increase in the PPI bill it still expected to meet market expectations for third quarter profits, but analysts said merely meeting forecasts would be seen as disappointing. Nomura, which has a reduce rating on the bank, said:</p> <blockquote> Looking at the strength of the results at US peers, meeting what we think of as semi-stale consensus is as good as a miss. The results are bound to underwhelm the market which would have expected some relative strength. </blockquote> <p>Barclays fell 6.85p to 233.85p, <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 1.38p to 40.49p after its Bank of Scotland division was fined \u00a34.2m for holding inaccurate mortgage records, while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland </strong>dipped 6p to 281p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Burberry</strong> was 8p better at \u00a311.88 after Investec lifted its recommendation from hold to buy. Analyst Bethany Hocking said:</p> <blockquote> We return to our bullish stance, after a brief period at hold post the profit warning. The first half pre-close reported two key pieces of news in our view -\"a modest improvement\" at the period end and a continued elevation in the 'luxury' nature of product sales. We have tweaked some assumptions, with the net effect of marginal increases in 2013 to 2015 pretax profit estimates. The Burberry brand is far from broken, operational leverage should come through, and, whilst volatility will remain, we see long-term value here. </blockquote> <p>Property group <strong>Hammerson</strong> moved 7.3p higher to 483.4p after paying \u00a3254m for four retail parks, including the Thurrock shopping park and Bristol's Imperial retail park.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Redrow</strong> crumbled 6.1p to 156.4p after an attempt to buy the housebuilder by its founder collapsed after the market closed on Thursday.</p> <p>Steve Morgan and a consortium including Redrow's second largest shareholder Toscafund had offered 152p a share for the business, valuing it at \u00a3562m. Other investors believed the price was two low, and there was talk a new offer of between 165p and 170p was being considered. But after the takeover panel extended the original bid deadline twice, no agreement could be reached and the discussions were terminated.</p> <p>Traders had been looking for the next industrial group to warn on earnings after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/12/morgan-crucible-warning-engineering?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">downbeat statements from the likes of Cookson and Morgan Crucible</a>.</p> <p><strong>Spectris</strong>, the testing and controls equipment group, was expected to join the club, but instead it issued an upbeat statement and its shares soared nearly 12% to \u00a317.79. It said sales had increased by 12% during the last quarter, including a contribution from recent acquisitions which was offset by a negative currency effect. At constant currency rates sales were up 2%, albeit this was a slowdown on the first half. It said: </p> <blockquote> Spectris remains well positioned to deliver on its expectations for the year as it realises both the benefits of its recent acquisitions, especially Omega, and the increase in the proportion of resilient revenues generated in the business. <br> </blockquote> <p>Andy Douglas at Jefferies said: </p> <blockquote> This is a resilient performance and better than many will have feared, with slower growth versus the first half of 2012, reflecting the macro-economic environment - this has been anticipated by the market. The outlook statement is 'in-line' for the full year, and whilst the top-end of consensus may be trimmed, we firmly reiterate our buy recommendation. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Drax</strong>, the coal-fired power station company, dropped 17.5p to 532.5p after HSBC downgraded its recommendation from overweight to neutral and cut its target price from 600p to 580p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> We are comfortable about biomass feedstock availability for the first phase of the company's coal-to-biomass transition plans. The CO2 price floor may boost the profitability of biomass but as it stands will lead to electricity demand destruction. </blockquote> <p><strong>Man</strong> continued its recent poor run, falling 2.4p to 81p. The hedge fund manager admitted on Thursday more client cash had been withdrawn than came in for the fifth quarter in a row, and warned there were few signs of improvement. Numis issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> Whilst there are some tentative signs that investor sentiment and flows have improved in the asset management industry generally (especially in Europe), Man does not seem to be benefiting from this. We continue to consider Man uninvestable, unless the share price were to fall below its liquidation value (all else equal), which we estimate as being worth 50p to 75p a share. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Pathfinder Minerals</strong> put on 14% to 1.875p after the mining company won a UK high court judgement confirming it was the rightful owner of its Mozambique subsidiary, CMDN, which holds two titanium licences. Pathfinder discovered last December that its mining licences had been transferred to an unaffiliated company in Mozambique called Pathfinder Mozambique, belonging to its former local partner, General Veloso. The company now has to have the UK ruling enforced in Mozambique.</p>",

Shoushou Safari Tours has an ICCN sign on display at its Bunagana office, but the operation has no link to the legitimate park authorities, said Virunga park director Emmanuel de Merode.</p> <p>\"These tours have absolutely nothing to do with us,\" said De Merode. \"This puts the gorillas and the visitors at risk. You need to have well-trained staff to lead these tours \u2013 handling mountain gorillas is an extremely sensitive issue. These expeditions are detrimental to the park and we condemn them in the strongest terms.\"</p> <p>Vianney Harakandi in the Virunga park tourism office in Goma confirmed that a handful of rangers had defected to join M23. He criticised Shoushou Safari Tours for trying to suggest the expeditions were official, saying it was an attempt to disguise the fact that the tours were aiding M23. \"Ultimately the money the tourists pay will just reinforce the capacity of this illegal armed group,\" he said.</p> <p>Eugene Rwabuhihi, from the M23 department of tourism, environment and conservation, suggested the rebels were planning to step up the operation. \"We are preparing for tourism activities and securing the gorilla population,\" he said. \"When tourists come, they will pay to see the gorillas and we will receive part of that money for providing their security.\"</p> <p>Tourists pay $300 for the permit to see the gorillas, $50 for transportation and $10 for the guides. It is unclear how much of this goes to the rebel group. But it is significantly cheaper than visits to see mountain gorillas in Uganda and Rwanda, where permits alone cost $500 and $750 respectively.</p> <p>Tourists wanting to see the gorillas usually fly to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, before driving to the Congolese border and crossing into Bunagana, where they stay in the Mountain Gorilla hotel. The hotel has recently hosted meetings of high-ranking M23 military commanders.</p> <p>Because the border crossing is controlled by M23, the tourists no longer have to obtain a Congolese visa. \"It is much simpler for me like this, because I don't have to pay for my visa, or organise all sorts of different permits and passes,\" said Abdel, a French tourist who has booked with Shoushou and did not want to reveal his surname. \"I am fascinated by the Congo, but I've never been. I'm going into a war zone and there is a lot that I don't know. I'm going there to learn, to get that knowledge.\"</p> <p>Abdel, who lives in Kampala, said he was not concerned that the tours were being conducted by, and make profits for, an armed rebel group. \"I want to be able to see the gorillas without lots of other tourists around, but this is also an experience that will allow me to see many things I've never seen before.</p> <p>\"I am keeping an open mind. The situation there is complicated; it's not as simple as saying 'the rebels are bad, the government is good'.</p> <p>\"My father fought in the Algerian resistance against France, and back then they called him a terrorist. But he was a freedom fighter.\"</p> <h2>National park plagued by death</h2> <p>Virunga is the oldest and most bio-diverse national park in Africa, but it has been ravaged by the cyclical violence that has plagued eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo over the last 25 years.</p> <p>The fall of Mobutu Sese Seko in the 1980s brought violence and poachers. Animal populations, especially of large mammals, were severely affected. The Rwandan genocide and subsequent Congo wars brought further instability, with the rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda establishing itself in the centre of the park.</p> <p>This instability culminated in the Kivu conflict of 2004 to 2009, where Laurent Nkunda's National Congress for the Defence of the People rebels built their strongholds in and around Virunga.</p> <p>His fighters finally signed a peace agreement in March 2009 and integrated into the Congolese army, allowing the Congolese National Park Authorities to oversee the recovery of Virunga's plants and wildlife, especially the rare mountain gorillas. Tourists had begun to return in increasing numbers; in 2009 the park received 550 visitors, by 2010 that figure rose to 3,000, and was projected to reach 6,000 this year.</p> <p>But in April those former fighters mutinied again, forming M23. The M23 commanders have taken key towns in and around the park, and for now it is largely under M23 control.</p> <p>Park authorities have been forced to suspend tourism again, and rangers risk their lives as they seek to ensure the security of the local Congolese people and Virunga's mountain gorillas. More than 130 rangers have been killed since 1996, including one in May.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers have announced a tightening of rules to prevent tuberculosis spreading between cattle, as the controversial badger cull aimed at curbing bovine TB <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn\" title=\"\">struggles to get started</a>.</p> <p>The strengthened rules, which will come into force from 1 January 2013, include changes to the testing regime and cattle movement restrictions.</p> <p>\"We need to stop the spread of bovine TB, which led to the slaughter of 26,000 cattle in 2011 alone,\" said Liberal Democrat agriculture minister David Heath. \"These strengthened measures, alongside our badger control policy and the ongoing development of vaccines, are about reducing risks from all possible sources of TB infection, to help control the disease and eventually eradicate it.\"</p> <p>The new measures include an extension of the region where farms must be tested yearly for TB: 10 new counties will be included across south-west, west and central England. The new rules on cattle movement mean that, in all cases, farmers who have had a case of TB in their farm will not be allowed to bring new cattle in until the rest of the herd has been tested for TB and a vet has carried out an assessment. In addition, farmers now have 30 days, down from 60 days, to move cattle that test negative for TB out of a TB breakdown farm.</p> <p>Veterinarian Mark Jones, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/world/united_kingdom/work/badgers/tips/badgers_action_toolkit.html\" title=\"\">Humane Society International</a>, which is campaigning against the badger cull, said: \"We welcome the changes, many of which are common sense in terms of disease control, but they should have been introduced long ago.</p> <p>\"The changes reflect the fact that there are many inadequacies in the current TB control measures, which should be addressed and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/05/badger-cull-tb-cattle\" title=\"\">their impact assessed</a> before any culling of badgers is considered. Defra appears to have finally recognised some of the serious flaws that exist within the current system.\"</p> <p>The new rules \"move a little way in the right direction\", according to Prof John Bourne, who led a landmark 10-year badger culling trial and also with many other scientists <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">opposes the government's proposed cull</a>. Bourne said only even stricter biosecurity would control bovine TB, as it had 50 years ago in the UK.</p> <p>It was recently revealed that a European Commission inspection conducted in September 2011 found a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">catalogue of failures in English farmers' biosecurity</a>. These included missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection at farm, vehicle, market and slaughterhouse levels, exacerbated by lack of adequate supervision\". All these problems increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle.</p> <p>Heath said: \"We already have strong measures in place to tackle transmission between cattle. However, we are always looking to improve our methods and will strengthen controls where necessary.\"</p> <p>Bourne said new measures still fail to recognise the problem that the test frequently gives false negatives, ie passes infected cows as healthy. When they are moved, they carry infection to new farms. Bourne said this could be overcome, as in the 1950s and 1960s, by banning any movement between heavily tested TB-free herds and herds which had not been heavily tested. \"The attested herd scheme was successful in UK in the 50s and 60s and was the basis of eradication in Australia,\" he said. \"But farmers would not like it and this is why it is unlikely to happen.\"</p>",
  "<h2>PREMIER LEAGUE MEDALS: NONE. THANKS: NONE</h2> <p>Poor old $tevie Mbe! There he goes, tirelessly running up and down the pitch, as he's done for the past 14 lung-busting years, demanding the ball, powering through midfield, sending 45-yard blooters over the heads of infinitely better-placed colleagues, and on the rare occasion one whistles past a surprised keeper's lugs and finds its way into the net instead of the top corner of the stand, bombing off towards the touchline, pushing aside and shrugging off any team-mates desirous of celebrating Liverpool's goal in order to ostentatiously point at the name emblazoned on the back of his shirt. All that effort, and for what? To stand accused of being a crass egotist, that's for what!</p> <p>\"I respect [$tevie Mbe] as a footballer, but there is nobody more egotistical than him,\" announced El-Hadji Diouf today, in an interview with le rag fran\u00e7aise L'Equipe. Now, we're assuming this particular parlez was conducted with one of Diouf's eyebrows twanging up and down like the tremolo arm on Duane Eddy's guitar*, because in a robust 165-word rant, the former Liverpool waste of space used the words \"I\" or \"me\" 19 times, meaning that 11.5% of the hot air coming out of his mouth was directly self-referencing. \"I leave my mark wherever I go,\" he boasted, presumably in reference to one of his spitting controversies or perhaps that time he was photographed stepping out of a vehicle which made Chris Eubank's truck look like a Fiat 500 wearing what appeared to be a onesie made out of terry towelling, because the Fiver will be jiggered sky high if it can remember him doing anything else of note while at Liverpool, Bolton, Blackburn, Sunderland, Rangers or Doncaster.</p> <p>But anyway, when the striker, currently at Dirty Leeds, wasn't patting himself furiously on the back for having \"never been to prison\" or having \"never injured anyone on the pitch\" \u2013 well done, El-Hadji, well done! \u2013 he was getting stuck into his old captain at Anfield. \"He does not care about others. I spoke to the major figures at Liverpool and nobody can stand him. And I am not talking about Jamie Carragher. I was in Pele's 100 players of the century! Not him!\"</p> <p>Whether any of this is true or not, the Fiver has no idea. (Even Pele can't have been that bloody daft, for a start. Eh?) But the Fiver also doesn't care. Consider this: even if $tevie Mbe is as self-absorbed and unpopular as Diouf insists, does it make any difference to how his Liverpool team-mates interact with him on the pitch? No. You don't have to like everyone you work with, after all. Take the Fiver's relationship with The Man, for example. He's a terrible sod, who keeps thrashing us on the bare buttocks with his golf club for little or no reason.

  "<p>It was only a matter of time before somebody broke the fragile social and political consensus surrounding <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/18/geo-engineering\" title=\"\">geoengineering</a>, and had a first crack at \"experiment Earth\".</p> <p>The news that American businessman Russ George <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering\" title=\"\">has dumped 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific Ocean</a> in an attempt to fertilise algal blooms that absorb carbon dioxide, was received with justified indignation and outrage by campaigners and mainstream scientists. But there have been rumblings (and <a href=\"http://www.handsoffmotherearth.org/learn-more/what-is-geoengineering/ocean-fertilization/\" title=\"\">rumours of shadowy trials</a>) for many years, and the idea of being a \"geoengineer\" was always going to prove tempting for the likes of George (who is blacklisted at several international ports for previous algae-related <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering\" title=\"\">misdemeanours</a>).</p> <p>Geoengineering \u2013 the possibility of using large-scale technologies to counteract the effects of climate change \u2013 has arrived. The question is, are we ready for it?</p> <p>From a scientific perspective, the answer is \"not yet\". Very little is known about any of the technologies that we might one day use to seize control of the global thermostat. Some sound like science fiction and will probably remain that way. Even the more familiar ideas \u2013 like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/13/manchester-report-biochar\" title=\"\">using biochar to capture CO<sub>2</sub></a> \u2013 are unknown entities when operating on a global scale.</p> <p>But the big questions, for now, have less to do with science and more to do with politics, as the Canadian iron dump illustrates so well. The ingredients of a classic controversy are all there - a wealthy, gung-ho businessman; a misled and powerless local population; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/17/canada-geoengineering-pacific?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">an allegedly complicit government</a> and a blanket of secrecy over the whole affair. <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/publications/public-engagement-geoengineering-research-preliminary-report-spice-deliberative-worksho\" title=\"\">Research has shown</a> that these are the kinds of issues that people are concerned about. And with individuals like Russ George around, who can blame them?</p> <p>The prospect of geoengineering raises fundamental questions about whether we are capable of actively, co-operatively and equitably managing the global commons. This is new territory: whereas the risks of a nuclear disaster are potentially global, the risks of geoengineering are inherently so. Are we ready to govern technologies that if ever deployed, would need to be maintained for decades \u2013 or perhaps even centuries \u2013 in order to keep temperatures down and the climate stable? The history of the past century suggests that we are in no position to manage technologies on this scale, or even keep rogue researchers in check.</p> <p>In fairness, there are some <a href=\"http://www.srmgi.org/\" title=\"\">serious efforts underway to anticipate the governance challenges</a> that geoengineering will raise, and to <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">involve public and civil society voices</a> in debates about how \u2013 or <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/publications/public-engagement-geoengineering-research-preliminary-report-spice-deliberative-worksho\" title=\"\">even if</a> \u2013 geoengineering research should go ahead. But thanks to a characteristically weasel-worded UN text, there is precious little clarity about the level of geoengineering research permitted under international law, allowing George to describe two widely cited moratoria on ocean fertilisation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/15/pacific-iron-fertilisation-geoengineering\" title=\"\">as \"a mythology\"</a>.</p> <p>Campaign groups like <a href=\"http://www.etcgroup.org/issues/climate-geoengineering\" title=\"\">ETC</a> \u2013 that have persistently opposed geoengineering experiments of any kind \u2013 are dismissed as scaremongers by some in the scientific community. But rogue experiments like this vindicate their warnings \u2013 and may compromise the integrity of the whole field in the eyes of the public.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/10/scientists-respond-to-rogue-ocean-fertilisation-experiment\" title=\"\">vast majority of scientists</a> working on geoengineering are well aware of the ethical implications of their research, and <a href=\"http://thereluctantgeoengineer.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">are reluctant</a> to suggest that they have sensible answers to climate change. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/17/us-geoengineers-spray-sun-balloon\" title=\"\">a handful are more enthusiastic</a>, and outside of the scientific community, there are plenty of people itching to promote a climate \"fix\", because geoengineering offers a method of tackling climate change that doesn't require asking any difficult questions about unsustainable systems of production and consumption.</p> <p>In the US, rightwing pressure groups <a href=\"http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2007/12/01/geo-engineering-seen-practical-cost-effective-global-warming-strategy\" title=\"\">like the Heartland Institute</a> have thrown their weight behind geoengineering as a \"cost effective\" solution to climate change, which is an incredibly telling insight into supposed climate scepticism. So often, a rejection of the science of climate change is just a proxy for a dislike of the policy implications. For those who object to the social engineering of behaviour change or regulation, geoengineering is a preferable option.</p> <p>It is the politics of climate change \u2013 not the science of geoengineering \u2013 that led to the iron dumping . Although artificial algal blooms are likely to have a range of unanticipated side-effects, it is not difficult to see how carbon captured through ocean fertilisation could easily be transformed into lucrative credits and fed into global carbon markets.</p> <p>And this possibility \u2013 profitable colonic irrigation for the planet \u2013 is simply too tempting for a rogue geoengineer to resist.</p> <p>\u2022 Adam Corner works in the <a href=\"http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/researchstaff/corner.html\" title=\"\">School of Psychology at Cardiff University</a> , for the <a href=\"http://talkingclimate.org/\" title=\"\">Climate Outreach Information Network</a>, and is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.iagp.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Integrated Assessment of Geoengineering Proposals</a> research team</p>",

Here's why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, declared himself pleased with the summit. Perhaps he still hopes that he will eventually receive help. But tonight it seems more likely that Spain appears to have been sacrificed for the sake of the bargain: Germany would agree to the principle of direct bank recapitalisation in 2013, possibly before its general election in the autumn of 2013, on the understanding that Spain would not actually ask for the money.</p> <p>If so, this is probably bad news for Ireland, which hoped to benefit from a retroactive arrangement to shift its banking burden to the euro zone.

  "<p>A judge took the unprecedented step this week of publicising <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/judge-missing-children-abducted-mother\" title=\"\">the apparent abduction of four children</a> involved in a custody battle between their Welsh mother and Spanish father. After being ordered to return her children to their father, Jennifer Jones allegedly absconded from her Carmarthenshire home with Jessica, 14, Tomas, 12, Eva, nine and David, eight. Airports and ports were put on standby. They were found 24 hours later, when the mother was arrested with her new partner and the children were placed in care before being taken back to Spain.</p> <p>The precise circumstances surrounding this case are not clear. However, in the past year, British consular assistance for help in child residence cases involving a partner from another country has been sought 17 to 29 times each month. There has been no rise in the total number of cases, but experts say there is one area where cases abroad are increasing, albeit one in which no statistics are collected and no records kept.</p> <p>John Mellor, service manager at <a href=\"http://www.cafcass.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service</a> (Cafcass), who specialises in cases of child abduction and international relocation, says he is seeing an increasing number of cases where a British couple split up after moving abroad with their British children.</p> <p>When one parent \u2013 usually the mother \u2013 wants to return to the UK with the children, Mellor says he or she finds out too late that the children are under a foreign jurisdiction and the British courts have no say over their future. \"This situation is becoming more common given global patterns of migration combined with the economic situation, which is leading to expat couples finding their jobs and businesses abroad collapsing,\" he says.</p> <p>Having a custody case heard in a foreign court, warns Mellor, can be highly detrimental to the mother's case. \"Unlike in the UK, where complex international custody cases are transferred to a higher court, in many foreign countries, a family court is usually quite a low-level judge in a little, local court which will never have dealt with one of these cases before and probably never will again.\"</p> <p>Decisions, he adds, tend to be made \"on a pretty hit-and-miss basis. There's little expertise, knowledge and understanding informing the decisions of those judges. Whichever parent puts the most compelling argument or plays to that judge's prejudicial assumptions will win. The judges often have default positions, like 'mothers who go away are not good mothers', or that 'a mother's place is in the home, no matter what'.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dawsoncornwell.com/en/about_amh.html\" title=\"\">Anne-Marie Hutchinson</a>, who won the international family lawyer of the year award and an OBE for her services to international child abduction, has dealt with at least six cases this year of British expat couples who found themselves fighting their custody battles in a foreign court.</p> <p>\"It happens in the UK too,\" she added. \"There are lots of eastern European women who came over to Britain with their families when the economy was strong. They want to go back home to their friends and families but their husbands won't let them take the children.\"</p> <p>It is the mothers, she says, who tend to come off worse when fighting for custody of their children in a foreign court. \"Women often can't get interim leave to bring their children home but also can't afford to stay abroad. Their former partners successfully spin them as having abandoned their children. But if they stay, they're penniless and thus have no prospect of persuading the court they can look after their own children.\"</p> <p>For the past two years, Mary has been battling with a Portuguese court for permission to bring her two young children back home with her to England.</p> <p><strong>Idyllic</strong></p> <p>Life was idyllic when Mary and Dan first moved to Portugal with their two young children. The British-born family bought land in an isolated part of the country and set about building their new home, living in a bus they had driven over from England and eating food they had grown themselves.</p> <p>The relationship unravelled in 2010, four years later. She wanted to come home but Dan refused and insisted the children, now seven and five, stay with him. To her surprise, Mary discovered the case had to be heard in a local, Portuguese court: by moving abroad, her children's country of habitual residence had shifted.</p> <p>\"International law makes it almost impossible for mothers to get a foreign court's permission to take their children back home,\" says Mary, who has asked for names to be changed for fear that talking to the media will harm her case. \"If I stay in the UK during those months, I could lose the court case by default because Dan will claim the children are, by then, happy in Portugal and settled without me,\" she says. \"But if I give up my life in England to go back out to Portugal, I will automatically lose my case because I will no longer have a house or a job back home to offer them.\"</p> <p>Mary is now studying full-time for a postgraduate certificate in education and has her own house in the north of England. She insists it is impossible for her to live in Portugal. \"I can't make a life there,\" she says. \"The farm is in the middle of nowhere. The closest two schools \u2013 the only places I could find work that would pay well enough to enable me to survive on my own \u2013 are a three-hour drive away, which means I would only be able to see the children one day a week. Added to which, jobs don't come up at either school very often so it's highly unlikely that I could even find enough work to be able to afford to stay in the country.</p> <p><strong>Isolated</strong></p> <p>\"I would have no savings, house or social benefit system to fall back on,\" she adds. \"I would be completely isolated: I don't speak Portuguese. I have few friends and no family out there.\"</p> <p>In contrast, says Mary, Dan could easily find employment in the British city where she now lives: the couple lived and worked there before moving together to Portugal. \"The children need their mummy,\" she says. \"It is not a choice between whether the children should live either with Mum or Dad, it's either 'Dad alone in Portugal' or 'Mum with family and optional dad in England'. Dan has the choice whether he lives in England. I cannot live in Portugal.\"</p> <p>Alison Shalaby is acting director of <a href=\"http://www.reunite.org/\" title=\"\">Reunite</a>, a UK charity dealing with the movement of children across international borders. She says her charity, part-funded by the Ministry of Justice and the Foreign Office, is handling an increasing number of similar cases from countries including Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong. They have had 16 this year already. Another 19 women have rung for advice.</p> <p>\"It's not about nationality or passports: by moving to a foreign country with a settled purpose, you are changing your children's country of habitual residence,\" she said. \"That can happen after just a couple of months.</p> <p>\"If parents can't decide where their children should live, the best-placed country to make that decision for them is the country of their children's residence,\" she said. \"If you choose to live in another country, you have to abide by the laws of that country.\"</p> <p>In the meantime, Mary says it is only because her new partner has paid for her flights and accommodation in Portugal over the past year that she has not already lost her case. \"If I had not met my new partner, I would not have been able to afford to see my children in Portugal and build a life for them in the UK at the same time. Apart from the emotional impact on my children and myself, that would have been devastating for my case.</p> <p>\"The law is wrong. I hate to say it, but I can see this ending up with me losing my children,\" she admits. \"I can't bear to think what my life \u2013 or theirs \u2013 will be like then. It's beyond imagining.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ireland's former richest man Sean Quinn has avoided prison for at least another fortnight after the high court in Dublin granted his legal team a 13-day adjournment.</p> <p>Quinn's son Sean Jnr was also released from prison on Friday after serving a three-month sentence for contempt of court \u2013 a charge that he, his father and his cousin Peter Darragh Quinn were all found guilty of earlier this summer.</p> <p>They were found guilty after it emerged the Quinns had moved assets worth millions of euros out of reach of the former Anglo Irish Bank. The bank alleges the Quinn family owe the now state-owned institution more than \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.6bn).</p> <p>Sean Quinn Jnr walked hand in hand his wife, Karen Woods, from Dublin's Four Courts to an awaiting BMW car.</p> <p>His father's legal team from Belfast told the court Quinn Snr's life would be at risk if he went to jail. They told the court that the bankrupt businessman wants to co-operate with the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation and purge his contempt.</p> <p>They have secured a 13-day adjournment to get up to speed on the case despite IBRC's concerns about delay.</p> <p>The bank's lawyers contend Quinn has done nothing to obey orders aimed at reversing a scheme to strip him of his valuable assets.</p> <p>They say that new evidence shows the Quinns are still in control of these companies and any substantial delay could mean certain assets will be lost for ever. His defence team countered that he is a 66-year-old who has had two major heart operations with his liberty at risk.</p> <p>Peter Darragh Quinn is effectively hiding from the Republic's authorities by fleeing to Northern Ireland. There are no legal measures in place for extradition because the case is a civil matter rather than a criminal one.</p> <p>Sean Quinn Snr lost his fortune in the international property market during the Celtic tiger boom years borrowing hundreds of millions of euros from the Anglo Irish Bank. The global recession and the property crash led to the collapse of the bank which was then nationalised as part of a state rescue plan of the debt-ridden Irish banking system.</p> <p>The Quinn business empire, built on a cement-making operation and a highly successful insurance firm, became the victim of over-reach into the property market. The Quinns personify the demise of the Celtic tiger economy and its over-confidence in a property boom.</p> <p>His fate has divided public opinion in the Republic in Cavan and Fermanagh, where the Quinns created thousands of jobs. Up to 5,000 people turned up last weekend for a rally in support of the family in its battle with the IBRC and the courts in Dublin. But there is little sympathy for the Quinns away from the family base.</p>",

It even makes money.</p> <p>We saw that sort of choice on the London Underground a few years ago when Gordon Brown, then at the Treasury, insisted on three private contractors doing the infrastructure modernisation \u2013 it's what's also belatedly being done to our creaking railways. Mayor Ken wanted it done in-house, which is where much of it has ended up when the private options ploughed it.</p> <p>It's not that public ownership is always the right answer. Often it's the wrong one, defended for the wrong reasons, including producer capture by managers \u2013 and unions \u2013 who want to run things as much for their own convenience. But the same applies to private sector panaceas. The trick is the mix, choice, contestability, competition, all subject to effective regulation and accountability.</p> <p>Regulation? The Financial Services Authority, another flawed Gordon Brown project (but let's not just blame him), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/19/regulator-rbs-abn-amro-financial-services-authority\" title=\"\">get another kicking today</a> for failing to prevent RBS's fatal acquisition of the Dutch bank ABN Amro just before the big crash in 2007. That's no excuse for not trying, just for trying harder to get the structures right \u2013 George Osborne's new model is criticised too \u2013 and not skimping on quality.</p> <p>The list goes on. This week the Guardian's Robert Booth reported on how the Tory leader of Cornwall county council, Alec Robertson, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/16/tory-privatisation-plans-blow-cornwall?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">forced to resign</a> after a council vote (63 to 49) of no confidence in his plans for mega-outsourcing of council services. Patrick Butler's accompanying analysis <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/16/thatcher-outsourcing-fantasy-fails-reality?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">recalled the Thatcherite fantasy</a> of local councils \"meeting once a year to hand out the contracts\".</p> <p>Cornwall is interesting, not just because it's my home patch. It's poor, it's an isolated peninsular except in the holiday months, and it's a monopoly local authority. That's right, the only one left after the last merger of five district councils, all folded into a unitary authority. Regulation and accountability is hard, though Felicity Lawrence's articles \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/sercogroup+profile/felicitylawrence\" title=\"\">here</a> \u2013 about Serco's patchy and manipulated record with its GP out-of-hours contract shows it can be done.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong. The mighty NHS has long been too much of a top-down monolith, directed as well as funded from Whitehall, too big to fail and too big to drive from the centre. I favour greater contestability and choice \u2013 more private and voluntary providers to improve the mix, promote innovation and efficiency, generally raise the service's game. Jeremy Hunt is announcing competence/revalidation checks for doctors today. Good.</p> <p>But I assume the private sector's bluff will be called in many ways and quickly called even in non-acute services they seek to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/private-sector-struggling-nhs-hospitals cherry-pick\" title=\"\">cherry-pick</a>. They don't do A&amp;E very well, for example. That's why Saudi princes who suffer heart attacks in Harley St are safer in NHS hospitals, which are used to such events. There's a stinker of a story about private hospital horrors in this week's Private Eye, by the way, but that doesn't invalidate their existence any more than an NHS horror story.</p> <p>This week James O'Shaughnessy, a former Cameroon No 10 policy director, wrote a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/17/michael-gove-pressure-profit-schools?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">pamphlet for Policy Exchange</a> suggesting that the private sector \u2013 in the shape of profit-making chains of academies \u2013 should be allowed to take over a swathe of failing state schools whose governance is so poor that it leaves no other choice if mediocrity is to be swept aide and poor kids given better life chances.</p> <p>Well, I'm all for better life chances. It's what Alan Milburn, a poor boy who got lucky, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/18/social-mobility-flatlining-adviser?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">saying again this week</a> about social mobility and our collective failure. But the state school system didn't grow up the way it did because Whitehall \u2013 busy running a world empire at the time \u2013 had nothing else to do. It did so because the private and voluntary (often religious) sectors were failing huge swathes of hard-to-reach kids.</p> <p>Things are much better today, but it's still not good enough in a world where Chinese and Japanese kids are working harder and smarter, and where brains and skills matter more than ever. Markets may rescue clever poor kids \u2013 they do that well at Harvard \u2013 but they can't and won't do enough for most of them. Why not? Money isn't everything, but it does help. There isn't enough of it to go round to give everyone the Etonian education David Cameron says he wants them to have.</p> <p>So we're discovering proper boundaries all the time, just as they did in the US all those years ago. Americans have been persuaded by rich corporations and their client politicians that socialised healthcare threatens their fragile sense of liberty. It costs citizens and the US economy enormous sums, much of which go to profits and salaries, not to better healthcare.</p> <p>We can do better in Europe because we have stronger traditions, religious and secular, of social solidarity. We'll have to do better because the money is running out to fund even what we have. Across the EU we've been spending \u2013 and promising \u2013 more on public services, from health to pensions, that we've been able to raise in taxes without piling them on to middling earners.</p> <p>The Scandinavians managed to do it, but their system is creaking too under the wider strains of global development, the have-nots finally getting their act together without the kind of welfare state Europe built over the past century. To keep afloat we'll all have to raise our game, Cameron's Tory conference speech got that bit right. But it won't be simply about adopting market remedies, as even he's begun to notice.</p> <p>Today's battleground is another market failure. The privatised energy industry has delivered a lot of gains \u2013 including investment capital, always a problem for the public sector \u2013 but is widely seen as a six-party cartel acting against the interest of the consumer and the public interest. Surprise, surprise! Energy utilities have long been hated in the US.</p> <p>In a throwaway remark to Labour's Chris Williamson at PMQs this week, Cameron carelessly promised to <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2012/october/prime-ministers-questions-17-october-2012/\" title=\"\">get everyone on the lowest tariff</a>. Tweeting away, I missed its significance, but so did most MPs, too busy shouting, I expect. No 10 has been on the back foot ever since. Like Labour before it, it has dithered over its complex energy options, as Simon Jenkins explains again <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/18/prices-cameron-energy-mess-power\" title=\"\">here</a>. Last night <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan\" title=\"\">Downing St was in retreat</a>.</p> <p>But the energy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/19/energy-firms-customers-cheapest-tariff\" title=\"\">regulator has stepped in this morning</a>, forcing the energy giants to reveal their lowest tariffs. Regulators are as vulnerable to producer capture as anyone else, and the struggle won't stop here. But it's a step in the right direction. Let's not take crap from these people just because they have a flashy logo and expensive lawyers. Market economy OK, market society not OK.</p>",
  "<p>Chances are the Coca-Cola can you drank from at lunchtime, the plane that flew you on your last holiday and the iPad on which you might be reading this article were made with metal from Alcoa, the world's third largest aluminium company.</p> <p>Aluminium is so energy intensive that it is often described as \"solid electricity\". Smelters account for around 3.5% of global electricity consumption, but it is difficult to imagine the modern world without this ubiquitous mineral.</p> <p>By definition, extractive industries are also environmentally and socially invasive and can cause shining sustainability targets to lose their lustre in the mines, smelters and manufacturing processes. But under Kevin Anton, the company's first chief sustainability officer (CSO) since 2010, Alcoa claims it is leading the industry in a cleaner, greener direction.</p> <p>\"Because we are an extractive industry, sustainability needs to be front and centre on the agenda,\" he said.</p> <p>Alcoa's activities are so large \u2013 $25.9bn (\u00a316bn) in revenues last year \u2013 that even small changes can have a huge impact. Unlike sectors with a lighter environmental footprint, such as software or retail, companies in extractive heavy industries face extreme challenges in raising the bar on sustainability.</p> <p>While \"sustainable aluminium\" may seem like magical thinking, for Anton, the event that landed him the CSO role was nothing short of a miracle.</p> <p>On a chilly January afternoon in 2009, at the peak of the financial crisis, Anton boarded US Airways flight 1549 destined for Charlotte, North Carolina. Just moments after take-off from LaGuardia Airport, New York, Canada geese struck the engines, forcing the pilot to land on the Hudson River.</p> <p>For Anton, who was helping steer the company through the banking crisis at the time, the \"unscheduled landing\" was something of an epiphany.</p> <p>\"After the plane incident, I was back to work the next day,\" he said. \"Some of my co-passengers reflected on it immediately. I reflected on it six months later: do I want my legacy to be as a great metals trader, a great finance guy or to make a difference in people's lives?\"</p> <p>Instead of volunteer work or a switch to the non-profit sector, he decided to try to create change from within. His ideas to boost Alcoa's sustainability drive were warmly received by Klaus Kleinfeld, chairman and chief executive officer.</p> <p>Alcoa's global operations in 31 countries have already benefited from concerted efforts to embrace the triple bottom line \u2013 people, profits and planet \u2013 according to Anton. The company also has a public issues committee in its board to review the progress of sustainability goals and a scheme that incentivises all staff to meet those goals.</p> <p>Last year, it ran 650 programmes to reduce energy consumption and emissions that led to cost savings of $100m (\u00a362m) while meeting their greenhouse gas (GHG) targets, said Anton.</p> <p>Product lines are also changing, with innovations in lighter alloys for the aviation industry that can increase fuel efficiency by 12% and a silver Cradle to Cradle certificate rating for its beverage sheets.</p> <p>\"If the product side wasn't there, maybe we wouldn't have the right to operate,\" said Anton. \"But we do make products that make the world better and help build our social licence to operate.\"</p> <p>By switching power sources to 66% hydropower, Alcoa has reduced carbon dioxide intensity by 23% between 2005 and 2011 and reduced its total emissions from 57.6m tonnes of CO2 in 2007 to 47.3m tonnes of C02 in 2011.</p> <p>Alcoa was so successful at GHG reductions that it exceeded its targets and had to reset them this spring; 30% reduction by 2020 and 35% by 2030, but those goals will become harder as the global economy recovers.</p> <p>The company also still produces more GHG emissions than the whole of Slovakia, for example, according to the latest data from the European Environment Agency.</p> <p>In addition, the emissions impact of aluminium does not end with carbon. Aluminium manufacturing produces perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which have global warming potentials up to 9,200 times greater than CO2, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p> <p>Unregulated toxic byproducts such as chromium, cobalt, nickel and arsenic also put Alcoa high up the list of <a href=\"http://www.peri.umass.edu/toxic100/\" title=\"\">Toxic 100 US</a> companies in an annual survey conducted by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.</p> <p>This year's Toxic 100 released in August shows Alcoa was ranked 20th, largely because of chemicals such as cobalt \u2013 a known carcinogen \u2013 coming from its alloy processing facilities. The EPA requires facilities to report these toxic emissions, not reduce them.</p> <p>Alcoa claims it has voluntarily and dramatically reduced emissions of unregulated toxins. At least one US facility has introduced technology that has reduced cobalt emissions from 252lbs in 2007 to less than 4lbs in 2011.</p> <p>Overseas, Anton also claims that Alcoa's extractive activities are also \"beyond compliance.\" Although nearly 75% of all aluminium produced since 1888 is still in use today, demand continues for new sources of bauxite, the raw material for aluminium.</p> <p>Many deposits are in pristine environments in developing countries and in addition to the dilemma that arises from the environmental degradation caused by extracting natural resources, there is also economic tension in those developing countries.</p> <p>Conrad Savy, director of responsible mining and energy at <a href=\"http://www.conservation.org/about/pages/about_us.aspx\" title=\"\">Conservation International</a>, said: \"We demand these minerals every day for all kinds of things. But three out of every four mineral-dependent countries are developing countries that want to emerge from poverty.</p> <p>\"It's a lot more complex than simply finding alternatives to aluminium, it's a huge economic driver.\"</p> <p>In 2000, Alcoa purchased one of the world's largest deposits of high-grade bauxite in Juruti. The company plans to extract 700m tonnes over the next 30 years and ship it for export via a 50km railway built by the company.</p> <p>Alcoa claims that it is attempting to set a new benchmark in conservation, habitat rehabilitation and social responsibility. After local protests, Alcoa entered into a royalty sharing agreement with the Juruti community.</p> <p>Patricia Bai\u00e3o, institutional relations director at Conservation International in Brazil, said: \"Alcoa's mining operation in Juruti has held up to expectations and we have good experience with it on the ground. It is very different from other mining projects which have historically been very bad for environmental and social issues.\"</p> <p>There is a bottom line advantage to adopting best practice to mitigate risk that would hurt profits. Savy said that banks often have conditions on environmental and social standards attached to loans. National legislation has also reached a high standard in countries like Brazil and industry associations such as the International Council on Mining and Metals sets a code of practice \u2013 however this is still voluntary.</p> <p>\"Even big companies borrow from global financial institutions and want to manage their financial and reputational risks,\" said Savy.</p> <p>Extractive industries earned such a bad reputation in developing countries that exploitation of natural resources continues to be a divisive issue. Recent scandals such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/trafigura-lessons-toxic-waste-dumping\" title=\"\">Trafigura toxic waste dumping scandal</a> serve as a reminder that grubby practices still continue behind the scenes.</p> <p>Kirsty Jenkinson, director of the markets and enterprise programme at the World Resources Institute in Washington, said: \"There are two camps. One that says pristine areas must stay that way. But there is another community that says, it's modern life, until as consumers we stop demanding this level of development and products, we need to encourage responsible mining.</p> <p>She added: \"If there's a new find in mineral reserves, you can bet those companies are going to be rewarded by the markets and shareholders for delivering that.</p> <p>\"It's very challenging to imagine a world where we cap growth and companies extracting new deposits. The whole economic model would have to change before we could put those kinds of limits in place.\"</p> <p>Alcoa says it is attempting to recalibrate the balance between environmental impact, local stakeholders and long-term shareholder value that distances it from rivals.</p> <p>\"Sustainability is maturing in our industry, but Alcoa is the most mature,\" says Anton. \"Others are catching up but we will run fast, so they can't catch up. Are we fully there? You're never fully there. But have we made a lot of progress in the last two years?\"</p> <p>It remains to be seen how much of an impact Anton will have from within. But if the company's claims ring true and as long as demand still drives extractive industries, it's a step in the right direction.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Brazilians will return to the polls next week less than a month after voters elected a record number of women as mayors, but gender equality is still a distant goal in a political culture long dominated by men.</p> <p>Only one female candidate will participate in the 50-city mayor run-offs on 28&#xa0;October, which means Brazil will continue to lag behind most other Latin American states in terms of the gender balance among elected officials.</p> <p>The popularity of Brazil's first female president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dilma-rousseff\" title=\"\">Dilma Rousseff</a>, and the planned widening of a quota system for women candidates have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/02/dilma-rousseff-pledge-empower-women-brazil\" title=\"\">raised expectations of rapid change</a>. But gains have proved steady rather than spectacular.</p> <p>In the first round of voting this month, <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/report-brazil-elects-record-number-women\" title=\"\">621 women were elected as mayors</a>, up from 504 in 2008 and 187 in 1996.</p> <p>The results prompted a commentator from the Hoje media group to declare \"women were the major victors in this election\", a conclusion echoed by several domestic newspapers. Candidates, however, remained more cautious.</p> <p>\"We are living a very important moment in Brazilian democracy, with the growth of female participation in politics and other types of power, which is a fundamental move forward to equal rights,\" said Teresa Surita, whose win in Boa Vista has made her the first Brazilian women to win a fourth term as mayor.</p> <p>But she emphasised that there was still a long way to go. Although women make up 52% of the electorate in Brazil, they account for only 12% of mayors (less than half the proportion in the UK and 5 percentage points lower than the US). \"The disproportion of legislative power between the genders is still huge,\" says Surita.</p> <p>Only one female mayoral candidate \u2013 Vanessa Grazziotin in Manaus \u2013 will run-off in the second-round of voting. The proportion of new women councillors elected this year rose only fractionally to 13.3% from 12.5% in 2008.</p> <p>In a recent UN study, Brazil ranked 116th out of 143 countries in terms of the number of women in the national legislature.</p> <p>It has been hoped that the gap would close more dramatically, partly as a result of affirmative action and largely because of the positive examples set by successful women politicians such as Rousseff, who enjoys approval ratings of more than 60%, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/22/forests.conservation\" title=\"\">Marina Silva, the environmental campaigner</a>.</p> <p>In 1995, Brazil imposed quotas on political parties, requiring that 20% of candidates should be women. That has since been raised to 30%. Next year, the ruling Workers party has pledged to allot 50% of council positions to women to help balance political entry-level positions.</p> <p>However, the largely voluntary quotas have been less effective than more stringent targets set in other Latin American nations.</p> <p>In Argentina \u2013 the first country in the world to introduce quotas \u2013 40% of national legislators are women. The president is Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. In Bolivia, which introduced quotas 15 years ago, the proportion is even higher at 47%.</p> <p>Change in Brazil has come more slowly, but commentators believe it is still profound.</p> <p>Oswaldo Munteal, a history lecturer at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro said the 2010 victory of Dilma was a turning point.</p> <p>\"Women have been less corrupt in politics. What is happening now is a consequence of that fact,\" he said. \"I think we're living a very important political moment for women.\"</p> <p>In many other areas of Brazilian society, women still lag behind men in terms of promotions and income, but the disparities appear to be shrinking. In 2007, women earned 67% of male salaries for comparable jobs. In 2011, the difference was 70.4%. Unemployment among women has fallen from 11% to 9.1%. For men there has been a similar fall, from 6.2% to 4.9%.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Carolina Massote</em></p>",
  "<p>The debate about climate change is dogged \u2013 possibly even defined \u2013 by its interminable, intractable tug of war over the \"facts\". A hand grenade is lobbed into no-man's land triggering a volley of return fire. But, when the dust settles, can anyone truly claim to have advanced their position?</p> <p>Of course, the art of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufactured_controversy\">manufacturing doubt</a>\" has long been in the playbook of those hoping or needing to divert attention away from evidence. We saw it a generation ago with smoking, just as we see it today with climate change. But knowing how this blatant tactic is deployed doesn't make it any easier to nullify or deter. Compounding the problem is the speed at which \"facts\" can now spread unchallenged across the internet. Rebutting or contextualising inaccuracies takes expertise and, above all, time and energy.</p> <p>This week has witnessed two text-book examples of this phenomenon in action. First, we had an article in the Mail of Sunday with the arresting headline that \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\">Global warming stopped 16 years ago</a>\". Predictably, it was <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/15/fox-falls-for-tabloid-science/190630\">picked up</a> and <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/352113/Global-warming-stopped-in-1997-\">repeated</a> across the world by news outlets keen to push that line. A day or so later the <a href=\"http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/met-office-in-the-media-29-january-2012/\">rebuttals</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/RickyRood/comment.html?entrynum=239\">clarifications</a> from scientists started to land, but the meme had already gained purchase with those seeking such confirmation.</p> <p>And then we heard the extraordinary news that Alan Jones, the Australian climate sceptic shock jock, had been ordered by the country's media regulator (<a href=\"http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD..PC/pc=PC_600069\">full ruling here</a>) to <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/shock-jock-jones-told-to-get-factual-accuracy-training-20121018-27srs.html\">undertake \"factual accuracy\" training</a>, and to employ fact-checkers, following one of his infamous near-daily rants about the climate \"hoax\".</p> <p>Each tale hints at a different outcome: the one that got away, versus the one that got caught. People can debate that, but I think taken together these two stories ask a deeper, more pertinent question about how \u2013 particularly in light of the fact that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/leveson-inquiry\">Leveson inquiry</a> is soon to publish its findings - the media can be persuaded, cajoled, forced \u2013 you chose the word \u2013 into taking a much more responsible position when it comes to relaying facts about climate change to its audience.</p> <p>What, for example, can realistically be done about David Rose and his periodic articles in the Mail on Sunday purporting to cast doubt on climate science? The <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/\">Press Complaints Commission</a> has confirmed to me that it has received complaints about the latest article's accuracy. But it adds that it takes, on average, 35 working days for it to investigate and adjudicate on such cases. How could that ever correct the fact that the story was picked up and repeated all around the world with hours? Will all those outlets publish any adjudication if, indeed, it rules against the Mail on Sunday? I think we already know the answer.</p> <p>Perhaps the scientists interviewed for the article should have smelt a rat, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/dec/08/david-rose-climate-science\">given Rose's form</a>? After all, <a href=\"http://judithcurry.com/2012/10/14/pause-discussion-thread/\">Professor Judith Curry complained</a> that she had been misattributed not just for this week's article (she claims she never said climate models were \"deeply flawed\" despite the article attributing this comment to her), but for the <a href=\"http://judithcurry.com/2011/10/30/mail-on-best/#comment-130079\">Mail on Sunday article last year</a> where he also quoted her. Why would she trust him second time round? Warning bells must have been sounding inside her head, surely? The result was that she spent the rest of the week <a href=\"http://judithcurry.com/2012/10/16/pause-discussion-thread-part-ii/\">posting</a> <a href=\"http://judithcurry.com/2012/10/17/pause-waving-the-italian-flag/\">ever-longer</a> articles on her blog trying to clarify and better explaining the \"facts\" within the original article.</p> <p>But, ignoring for a moment that she had already been stung by Rose once before, what measures could she realistically have taken to ensure the article printed was an accurate portrayal of the basic facts, as well as her own views? This is a dilemma that faces all climate scientists when they are approached by journalists. The last thing we want is for scientists to retreat back up into their ivory towers.</p> <p>One of the best forms of rapid rebuttal we now have to counter misinformation is the fact that an increasing number of scientists are taking to Twitter meaning they can react instantly if they spot mistakes in the media. And they can also directly and publicly field questions via Twitter, not just from journalists but from the wider interested public. Sure, a very small section of society actually use Twitter, but it is closely followed by most journalists so you would hope comments posted by scientists crying foul would be picked up, absorbed and disseminated.</p> <p>What about \"punishing\" the journalists who persistently mislead on climate change? Is exposing their mistakes and wilful misinformation enough? Or do they need to face some kind of tougher sanction? If so, who would act as the judge, jury and prosecutor? Are ombudsmen a powerful enough deterrent? (The Guardian, for example, has a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/page/readerseditor\">reader's editor</a>, who acts independently of the editorial staff. But many media outlets still do not have one.)</p> <p>I certainly have mixed views about the training course that Alan Jones has been ordered to undergo. On the one hand, it has the benefit of shaming him \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.galileomovement.com.au/who_we_are.php\">and his associates</a> - very publicly. But, equally, is it really likely to make much of a difference to his \"journalism\"? As a professional controversialist, he knows the prejudices of his audience intimately and he plays up to them relentlessly. His \"martyrdom\" might even improve his standing with his supporters, such is their logic.</p> <p>Personally, I think this is all very much an open question. I certainly don't envy Lord Leveson in his deliberations on how best to improve the standards and veracity of journalism. I certainly hate the idea of anyone being denied a voice or a platform - if that's even possible any more with the option of self-publishing online. Publish and be damned, etc. But can we really continue to allow some journalists to manipulate and distort the \"facts\" for their own purpose unchecked, particularly with subjects such as climate change? As the famous saying goes: \"You're entitled to your own views, but not to your own facts.\"</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220722/Global-warming-The-Mail-Sunday-answers-world-warming-not.html\">David Rose</a> and <a href=\"http://judithcurry.com/2012/10/21/sunday-mail-again/\">Judith Curry</a> have each posted a new article, in part as a response to this blog. Rose has also sent me a direct response, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/19021663\">which I have posted in full below</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Turkey has called on the US, Britain and other leading countries to take immediate action to intervene in Syria to prevent a looming humanitarian \"disaster\" that it says threatens the lives of millions of internally displaced people and refugees as winter approaches and could soon ignite a region-wide conflagration.</p> <p>Appealing to the major powers to set aside their differences over how to end the 20-month-old civil war in which an estimated 32,000 people have died, Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said the crisis had gone on for long enough. The Syrian people were crying out for help and their pleas could no longer be ignored.</p> <p>\"How long can this situation continue? I mean in Bosnia, now we have Ban Ki-moon [the UN secretary general] apologising 20 years after. Who will apologise for Syria in 20 years' time? How can we stay idle?\" Davutoglu told the Guardian in an exclusive interview in Istanbul.</p> <p>\"We [Turkey] are doing all we can to help these people, using all diplomatic capacity to stop this bloodshed. But there should be a much more concerted effort by the international community. The best way we can see now is direct humanitarian intervention.\"</p> <p>The call came as the UN's peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, travelled to Damascus for crucial talks with the regime due to be held on Saturday \u2013 the latest bid, after several failed international initiatives, to bring a halt to the killing. Brahimi is expected to propose a temporary truce, beginning on 26 October, the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday, in the hope that it may lead to a permanent ceasefire.</p> <p>Predominantly Muslim Turkey, a leading Middle East power that is also a Nato member and long-time US ally, has been caught in the storm as the Syrian crisis has unfolded south of its shared 560-mile (900km) border. Opinion polls show most Turks are fearful of their country being sucked into the Syrian quagmire.</p> <p>More than 145,000 refugees have taken shelter in improvised camps or Turkish cities, fighters of the Free Syrian Army and their Gulf backers use Turkey as a base and covert weapons supply route, and fighting has spilled on to Turkish soil.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Syrian shelling killed five Turkish civilians in the town of Ak\u00e7akale, triggering a week of cross-border artillery and mortar exchanges and fears of all-out war. Turkey also recently forced down an aircraft flying from Russia to Syria that it said was carrying military equipment.</p> <p>Turkey's earlier proposal to the UN to set up a border buffer zone, backed by a possible no-fly zone, was ignored by the US, Britain and other Nato members wary of involvement in another Middle East war. Russia and China oppose direct intervention.</p> <p>Now, clearly frustrated by the impasse and deeply concerned at the prospect of a spreading conflict, Turkey's leaders appear to be adopting a tougher line while appealing to the world's conscience.</p> <p>The Syrian regime's continuing use of air bombardment and heavy weapons against Syria's civilian population was propelling the country and the region towards a human catastrophe, Davutoglu said. A much more robust response was required from London, Washington and Paris.</p> <p>\"If nothing is done, maybe in the next two months it [the number of refugees] will double to 200,000, even 400,000 \u2026 When the technology the regime was using was snipers, the refugees were coming in a few thousands. Now they are using artillery shells and tanks, the number increased rapidly,\" Davutoglu said.</p> <p>\"We want the international community to find a solution to resolve this issue inside Syria. All means can be discussed. But there must be proper humanitarian access. We have 145,000 refugees in Turkey but there are millions of people, two million people inside Syria who are IDPs [internally displaced people]. Those that are lucky can come to Turkey. They are the lucky ones.</p> <p>\"So there has to be humanitarian access, a humanitarian mission inside Syria, and the international community must be ready to protect it. This is the question, whether it is a buffer zone or humanitarian access \u2013 how these people are to be protected inside Syria. We are calling for an international humanitarian mission to go into Syria and be protected to stop the refugee flow.</p> <p>\"The international community must make a decision. Humanitarian access must be guaranteed by any means that is acceptable. These people are human beings. The winter is approaching. How will they survive the winter?\"</p> <p>Davutoglu stressed any new initiative must be backed by the UN security council. If it established a mechanism to guarantee international humanitarian assistance inside Syria, Turkey would support it and would allow its soil to be used as a base. But Turkey would not act alone or without UN authorisation, he said.</p> <p>Alluding to the Obama administration, which has been criticised by Republicans for a weak response, as well as to Britain and other countries, Davutoglu said: \"We expect the leading powers of the international community to be more firm, more decisive and clear in their policy regarding oppression in Syria.\"</p> <p>Davutoglu said Turkey was not seeking military confrontation with the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. But the international community must send a \"stark warning\", via the UN security council, that some of Damascus's actions constituted a \"war crime\", he said. Turkey wanted the immediate creation of a transitional government, leading to democratic elections. If Assad wanted to avoid facing war crimes charges in The Hague, he should stop killing his own people.</p> <p>While Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister, has called for Assad to step down, Davutoglu said it was ultimately a matter for the Syrian people.</p> <p>\"It is not our business, it is for them to decide. But after such a criminal act, such oppression and aggression, more than 30,000 people have been killed, we don't know how many are lost, millions are IDPs, and maybe more than 500,000 are refugees, how can such a person [Assad] who is responsible for these statistics continue to run a country?\"</p> <p>With Brahimi due in Damascus, Davutoglu said Turkey would support a meaningful peace process in Syria but its end objective must be a transfer of power.</p> <p>The biggest problem for any talks process was that Assad could not be trusted to keep his word, Davutoglu said. Turkey has suggested that Faruk al-Shara, Syria's vice-president, might lead any transition negotiations. This idea was predictably rejected by Damascus, and by its main regional ally, Iran.</p> <p>\"We don't see a serious counterpart in Damascus for such talks who is powerful or strong enough to fulfil commitments \u2026 Last year myself personally and other senior state officials went to Damascus to convince the regime to halt the violence against civilians. But unfortunately they did not fulfil their promises.</p> <p>\"What is the purpose of any dialogue if it legitimises the Syrian regime? If they are sincere, there are channels to have a dialogue, UN special envoy Brahimi and many other channels. If they come to us with a proposal to end the bloodshed and allow the people to decide their own future, then there will always be a channel.\"</p> <p>Davutoglu said he was hopeful that Russia, wary of another Libyan-style, regime-changing Nato operation, might be persuaded to soften its anti-interventionist stance, once the scale of the impending humanitarian crisis became clear.</p> <p>\"I have contact with [Sergei] Lavrov [Russia's foreign minister]. They have their own approach especially after the Libyan experience, but even if there was a mistake or something wrong in Libya and I don't think that there was, why should Syrian people pay the price?\"</p> <p>Asked about US concerns that hardline jihadi groups were hijacking Syria's uprising, Davutoglu said that possibility made a swift solution all the more urgent.</p> <p>\"The presence of some groups on the ground should not be used as an excuse for not being active. Prolonging the crisis will create a much more critical environment concerning these groups. We must have a solution and act as soon as possible to avoid a power vacuum in Syria.</p> <p>\"We must immediately establish a transitional government and let the Syrian people see a light at the end of the tunnel. At present they do not see light at the end of the tunnel. In the surrounding darkness, anyone can do anything.\"</p>",
  "<p>The death of any institution is never easy, but in the case of Newsweek, the magazine that helped to define post-war America to itself and to the rest of the world, the timing of its demise seems particularly cruel. On 31 December it will hit the newsstands in physical form for the last time \u2013 less than three weeks before it would have been celebrating its 80th birthday.</p> <p>It was on 17 February 1933 that a new magazine by the name of News-Week grabbed the attention of US readers with an inaugural cover bearing a chilling image of Hitler's Nazi flags. Over the next \u2013 almost \u2013 eight decades it earned, despite its great and enduring rivalry with Time magazine, a place at the high table of American public and cultural life, setting news agendas and framing debates that the rest of the US media was often quick to follow.</p> <p>But such top-down sculpting of current affairs, such single-lens definition of the Way It Is, sits uneasily with the splintered multifariousness of the internet and in recent years the magazine has struggled to find its place amid the cacophony. From about 2007, harsh economic realities set in too, with plummeting advertising revenues leading to spiraling losses.</p> <p>On Thursday morning Tina Brown, the current editor-in-chief of Newsweek and of The Daily Beast website, with which it merged in 2010, announced what some commentators took to be the inevitable. The magazine, she said, would transition to an all-digital format early next year and the printing presses would be switched off.</p> <p>Brown put a positive spin on the decision, stressing that the magazine, under a new title of Newsweek Global, would continue to thrive online. </p> <p>\"We are transitioning Newsweek, not saying goodbye to it. We remain committed to Newsweek and to the journalism that it represents.\"</p> <p>But there is no doubting the significance of the moment, both as one of the biggest digital switchovers that has been undertaken by any media institution, and also to the American media and cultural landscape. </p> <p>\"This is a sad day,\" said Evan Thomas, a former Newsweek editor-at-large who worked for the magazine for 24 years. \"It had a great run that was bound to end eventually, but this is still a sad day.\"</p> <p>From the beginning, Newsweek was defined by what it was not. It was launched by a former Time editor, as a competitor to the original weekly news magazine that is exactly 10 years its elder.</p> <p>\"Newsweek found a good niche as number two to Time. It was a little edgier, a little rougher, and it always wanted to scramble ahead of its great rival,\" said Thomas, who now teaches journalism at Princeton.</p> <p>That edginess, coupled with greater speed and arguably less of the complacency that came with the front-runner status of the cautious and conservative Time, came into its own in the 1960s and 70s under the management of the Washington Post company and such journalistic titans as Ben Bradlee. Newsweek captured the spirit of the sexual revolution, the rise of feminism and civil rights and the protests against Vietnam in a way Time never managed.</p> <p>\"Newsweek's coverage of the sixties helped it achieve parity and in many ways surpass Time in the way it handled the news \u2013 and then it became a true competitor,\" said Mark Miller, director of editorial operations for the merged Newsweek-The Daily Beast.</p> <p>Existential questions have hung over the magazine for many years. Miller recalls that when he joined Newsweek in 1985 it was already embroiled in an energetic debate about whether news weeklies had a place in the media firmament, prompted by the rise of cable TV news.</p> <p>There were the occasional cock-ups too, as there always are in news organisations. The magazine bought into the 1983 hoax over the Hitler diaries; 15 years later, Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff picked up the first details of the Monica Lewinsky scandal but his editors balked at running the story.</p> <p>But it continued to enjoy a special role in American current affairs and until the advent of the internet undermined its economic model it prospered. Just five years ago it still had a paying subscription list of more than 3 million \u2013 a robust base that began to slide in 2008 and now stands at about half that number.</p> <p>In 2010, with annual losses reaching more than $40m, it was sold for a dollar to the hi-fi tycoon Sidney Harman, who promised to back its journalism with his substantial personal fortune. Under Harman, Newsweek went into its merger with The Daily Beast, a venerable 20th-century title fusing with a fledgling 21st-century digital invention.</p> <p>But Harman's death last year left the magazine exposed, and his heirs decided to pull the plug. Barry Diller, the media billionaire who bankrolls The Daily Beast, has clearly decided that his largesse only goes so far.</p> <p>Much focus is likely to be put in coming weeks on the role of Tina Brown. The vivacious British former Vanity Fair and New Yorker editor has had controversy follow her in her many ventures.</p> <p>Samir Husni, a magazine analyst and blogger, blames Brown for 90% of Newsweek's current financial woes. He points to the many controversial cover stories run under her tutelage \u2013 notably the cover in which Newsweek imagined Princess Diana aged 50 and the one with a photo of Barack Obama above the headline \"The First Gay President\".</p> <p>\"Tina Brown will go into the media history books as someone who took an iconic magazine and gave it a very painful death. Instead of giving Newsweek's many readers the in-depth analysis they craved, she turned it into a laughing stock,\" Husni said.</p> <p>That's ridiculous, said Thomas: \"I think Tina Brown gave it a good shot. She tried to breathe new life into the magazine but economic reality confounded her.\"</p> <p>The silver lining, in Miller's view, is that Newsweek has shown since the merger with The Daily Beast that its content can fly on the internet. He points to the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/08/19/niall-ferguson-on-why-barack-obama-needs-to-go.html\">highly contested article by the historian Niall Ferguson</a> calling for a new incumbent of the White House under the headline \"Hit The Road, Barack\".</p> <p>\"That article began as a Newsweek cover, but the real debate around it began when it went viral online through posting on The Daily Beast,\" Miller said.</p> <p>Most of Newsweek's content will now be disaggregated from The Daily Beast and put onto its own website, behind a pay wall that will charge subscribers for access in much the same way as the print magazine has operated for nearly 80 years. Miller at least professes confidence.</p> <p>\"People want more intelligent comment and information, and are reading Newsweek now more than ever before. Is there still a role for a weekly magazine online? \u2013 for me the answer is self-evident.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you've got time and the right sort of controls on your television, it's worth a look \u2013 or a second look for that matter \u2013 at the highlights of Danny Cipriani's 31 minutes on the pitch at Sale last Sunday.</p> <p>A try six minutes after leaving the substitutes bench and another made about eight minutes later. I draw no conclusions. It was against a Cardiff Blues side that is having a difficult time. The acid test will come with the second round of the Heineken in Montpellier on Sunday when Sale visit one of France's top six sides; a team well coached by Fabien Galthi\u00e9 and one which will be smarting from losing the local derby with Toulon last weekend.</p> <p>That said, in a few minutes Cipriani showed what he can do and what we have been missing since he upped sticks two seasons ago, leaving Wasps for Melbourne. He is still what he has always been \u2013 a remarkable talent, if one who can intrigue as much for the controversy that often accompanies him as for skills well beyond the scope of most players.</p> <p>From experience, I'm willing to bet he is both delighting and frustrating whoever is coaching him at Sale. However, it was a good to see that they are still giving Danny his head. Against Cardiff Blues it paid dividends. A give and go plus the hint of a dummy to go clear for the first try, then the pirouette out of Gavin Evans's tackle before the off-load a split second before contact, which made another for wing Mark Jennings.</p> <p>Both tries contained the elements which make Cipriani so dangerous to any defence, in particular the change of pace he uses to leave defenders rooted to the spot. He doesn't go flat out all the time, but leaves guys flat-footed much as Toby Flood sometimes does, Jonny Wilkinson did in the middle of his career and, famously, Rupeni Caucaunibuca did repeatedly at the 2003 World Cup to the delight of everyone bar Scotland.</p> <p>The masters are the Fiji sevens side, but Danny adds to the confusion of defenders by standing flat, giving little thinking time and by what he does with the ball. Perfectly correctly, he always holds the ball in two hands until he's through a tackle, but before then he might have raised it to the chest or slung it on his hip. The speed of hand movements also vary; slow inviting the tackle, only to leave defenders grasping at shadows.</p> <p>On Sunday he turned the game, no doubt to Alex Cuthbert's frustration. It's not often that a wing scores a 19-minute hat-trick and still finishes on the losing side and the defeat was poor reward for a player who works hard at his game and is probably one of the fittest, if not the fittest, in the Wales team.</p> <p>However, Cuthbert should be playing in the autumn internationals. For Danny they come a bit early, but this week's question is what lies ahead for the talent that is 18-year-old Ga\u00ebl Fickou and how will his promise be handled.</p> <p>It's not often wise to hark back to predictions made successfully because others might choose to remember those which behaved like a lead balloon. However, I remember writing about Fickou after the Under-18 World Cup in Madrid back in April, suggesting that it would not be long before the then Toulon centre made Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9's national squad.</p> <p>After a summer in which he moved from Toulon to Toulouse and a weekend in which Leicester suffered on his Heineken debut, the France coach has now called up Fickou and another seven uncapped players, saying it was time for France \"to change generations\". That squad, which features 15 players under 25, will be reduced before France play Australia on 10 November, but Fickou is at the very least getting his first taste of life in camp with France at Marcoussis. It's unlikely to be his last.</p> <p>According to Warren Gatland Test players have to tick two of three boxes. Well, Fickou is big and he's fast \u2013 ask Anthony Allen and he's no slouch himself. If Fickou also has the skills then he'll become a global star.</p> <p>Who he plays alongside is another matter. There are already those pairing Fickou with Clermont Ferrand's 24-year-old centre Wesley Fofana and they may well play many times together. But I suspect not just yet. My guess is that the pragmatist in Saint-Andr\u00e9 will recall the other Clermont centre, Aur\u00e9lien Rougerie, if only for his defence, and let Fickou learn for a while as his understudy.</p>",

I had to abandon my career in favour of a low paid highly skilled job at a local high school, where I remain to this day. The job paid enough to just about get by but left me in large amounts of debt, something I only recently paid off due to an inheritance from my late father paying out.<br>I can only offer the following advice to Mr Boden, persevere even in the face of rejection. My mother, who had a severe mental breakdown, was consistently refused any form of benefit and my local GP was partially to blame for this, refusing to diagnose her correctly. In the end when we went to medical health specialists they told me if she had been denied treatment anymore, she would not have been able to recover mentally, possibly full time care for the rest of her life. As it is she was treated, exceptionally well, and recovered sufficently to work. At the time she was refused ESA, then awarded ESA, then they demanded its return for reasons we could not fathom. We eventually gave up with them and luckily she was okay to work. At an ESA tribunal they requested a mentally ill woman present her case, and didnt tell her she needed a medical expert on hand with her. 2nd time she went to the tribunal, they told her that her case worker was not sufficient, despite being a medical professional, and she needed her actual psychiatric doctor on hand, who was not available for several months, hence why we gave up. She now claims for disability living allowance and was awarded a high component and a low component because of her learning difficulties, she has a particularly low IQ. It all depends on the person handling your case, a disgraceful set of affairs but nothing you can do about it other than persist and lobby.<br>Mr Boden you need to first of all find a GP who is sympathetic to your situation, who can come up with a fully detailed report about you and your injuries, and who is willing to support your application for ESA and DLA. Our family doctor for years was replaced by two new GP's, one a reckless idiot who refused to do anything, the 2nd was a Polish lady who did absolutely everything possible to help despite being new to the area.

Housing a family and paying ofr electriicty and water costs so much that parents keep children home from school if they do not have enough to send them with lunch or eat less themselves.

  "<p>Solid demand in the US and Asia helped General Electric post an 8.3% rise in quarterly profits, despite a weaker European market and falling demand for wind turbines.</p> <p>The US conglomerate, which makes electric turbines and trains, reported net income of $3.5bn (\u00a32.2bn), or 33 cents a share, for the third quarter. This is up from $3.2bn, or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. Stripping out one-off factors, the profit was 36 cents a share, which matched analysts' forecasts. Revenues climbed 2.8% to $36.4bn.</p> <p>\"The global economy is uncertain, and we are prepared for a variety of economic outcomes,\" said chief executive Jeff Immelt. He reiterated the company's target to increase earnings at a double-digit percentage rate in 2012.</p> <p>The company, which is based in Fairfield, Connecticut, has focused on its industrial operations such as manufacturing jet engines, refrigerators and providing equipment and services to energy companies after its banking arm GE Capital threatened to sink the whole group during the financial crisis of 2008-09.</p> <p>Revenue from its industrial divisions rose 8% in the third quarter and is up 10% so far this year. But orders for new equipment and services were down 5% compared with last year, mainly because wind turbine orders have fallen dramatically ahead of the scheduled ending of a US federal subsidy for wind power in December. Excluding the dip in wind turbine orders, the company's industrial orders were up 4%.</p> <p>The company's energy infrastructure and transportation divisions posted the strongest growth. Energy infrastructure profits rose 13% and transportation profits rose 35%.</p>",
  "<p>The government's finances look far less grim than feared in the first six months of the tax year, taking some of the pressure off George Osborne ahead of December's autumn statement.</p> <p>However, the improvement is probably not enough to allow the chancellor to meet his fiscal targets and some economists believe he may have to change his fiscal rules.</p> <p>In a double dose of good news for the chancellor, official figures showed that the government borrowed less than expected last month as a pickup in economic activity pushed tax receipts higher, while borrowing halfway through the financial year is billions lower than previously thought.</p> <p>Treasury minister David Gauke told the BBC the figures were \"reasonably encouraging\", but added: \"There is no room for complacency. Even with these numbers we are still borrowing historically a very large sum of money indeed and it is right that we continue to focus on getting the deficit down.\"</p> <p>The budget deficit was the lowest for a September since 2008, another pleasant surprise for the government in a week in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/17/uk-unemployment-falls-lowest-ons\" title=\"\">employment rose to a record high</a>.</p> <p>\"After a poor first four months of the year when borrowing was higher than a year earlier, this has now reversed and borrowing is falling relative to the same month a year earlier,\" noted Alan Clarke at Scotiabank. \"The public finances are not looking like the disaster that they previously did.\"</p> <p>Public sector net borrowing, excluding the 2008 banking bailouts, was \u00a312.8bn, compared with \u00a313.5bn in September 2011, the Office for National Statistics said. It was also below City expectations of a \u00a313.5bn deficit, as tax receipts kept up with spending increases.</p> <p>An improvement in economic activity drove a 3.7% rise in tax receipts to \u00a342bn, while government expenditure also rose by 3.7%, to \u00a352.5bn, including a 1.6% rise in spending on social benefits.</p> <p>Borrowing for the first five months of the financial year was revised downwards by \u00a36.7bn and, combined with September's outturn, the deficit to date is just \u00a35bn higher than a year earlier. The revisions reflect new data received from government departments, metholodogical changes, as well as a mistake made by the ONS last month.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast in March the budget deficit would fall to \u00a3120bn this tax year from last year's revised \u00a3121.6bn, excluding the effect of a transfer of Royal Mail pension assets.</p> <p>Responding to the latest figures, the OBR said: \"While it looks likely that corporation tax receipts will fall short of our March forecast, the other main receipts streams remain closer to forecast. Clearly much will depend on the performance of the real economy and inflation over the remainder of the fiscal year.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said \"the chancellor now has a slim \u2013 rather than seemingly no \u2013 chance of meeting his fiscal targets for 2012-13, but he will need the economy to achieve clear growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 after a highly probable return to growth in the third quarter. This won't be easy.\"</p> <p>He thinks it likely Osborne will miss his target by \u00a35-10bn.</p> <p>Allan Monks, UK economist at JP Morgan, said: \"With the OBR likely to revise growth down for next year, we estimate that the government's rule stipulating that the net debt ratio should be falling by 2015/16 will still be missed in the absence of additional measures. We still expect Osborne to respond to this by delaying the targeted date for debt reduction by one year.\"</p> <p>Public sector net debt rose to \u00a31.065 trillion last month, equivalent to 67.9% of gross domestic product (GDP). This compares with \u00a31.044tn in August and \u00a3972.5bn, or 63.6% of GDP, in September last year.</p> <p>Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"If the trend in the first six months of the fiscal year continues, it still looks like borrowing for 2012-13 will overshoot the OBR's forecast of \u00a3120bn by about \u00a37bn. Given this deterioration and increasing concerns over the true impact of deficit reduction on the economy, the chancellor may be compelled to alter his fiscal rules in December's autumn statement.\"</p>",

  "<p>On Friday afternoon, the Royal Society hosts a group <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_run_an_edit-a-thon\" title=\"\">edit-a-thon</a> aimed at <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/events/2012/wikipedia-workshop/\" title=\"\">improving Wikipedia articles about women in science</a>. It is timed to link with <a href=\"http://findingada.com/\" title=\"\">Ada Lovelace Day</a> earlier this week, an event that seeks to share stories about inspirational women in science.</p> <p>Admitting that Wikipedia is a first port of call for most people looking for basic, and sometimes not so basic, biographical information, the event is an attempt to improve the quality of entries and raise the profile of women in science and engineering, both past and present. Not simply relying on other online resources, participants will be able to make use of the Royal Society's unique collections, as well as its library staff and representatives of Wikipedia UK.</p> <p>The society's library is enjoying its 350th anniversary this year, although it is only for the past 67 years that women <a href=\"http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2010/06/30/rsnr.2010.0043?cited-by=yes&amp;legid=roynotesrec;rsnr.2010.0043v1\" title=\"\">have been admitted as fellows</a>. Despite increasing efforts to ensure a level playing field, female fellows are still a tiny minority, being only 5% of <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/\" title=\"\">the total</a>. Awareness of this disparity undoubtedly makes the Royal Society keen to focus on celebrating successful women in science and on inspiring the next generation.</p> <p>The event itself raises some interesting themes and ideas. The most obvious is the fact that the contribution of women to science, and elsewhere, can be made more visible. Our view of what counts in the history of science is very much influenced by older assumptions and past prejudices. Prizes, publications, professional positions and fellowships are key markers, and automatically lead to commemoration of achievements in obituaries, which are the first drafts of future biographies. Women were, of course, generally barred from such recognition until all too recently.</p> <p>Other markers, therefore, need to be sought and added into our accounts, and Wikipedia is the kind of cumulative and fluid environment in which this can be done.</p> <p>When looking for the women, and for those other markers of eminence, researchers find themselves beginning to think about what counts as an important contribution to science in a slightly different way. There is, necessarily, less emphasis on the traditional roll call of theoretical advances (of the Copernicus-Kepler-Newton-Einstein variety)</p> <p>and an appreciation of the essential contribution that collectors, experimentalists, technicians, writers, translators, teachers and calculators have made.</p> <p>This, by rights, should lead to the widening of the net of scientific biography to include a whole load of underappreciated men as well. Some, such as top instrument makers, were seen as being hugely skilful, knowledgeable and important in their day but are often poorly represented on Wikipedia. Others were not given the opportunities to be recognised or remembered, with lower class or non-European men being, like women, essentially disenfranchised.</p> <p>This may appear to work against the spirit of the day, but is equally important in terms of appreciating the way science has really operated in history and how it generates knowledge, meaning, agreement and conflict across diverse societies today. For British women, however, it is possible that the most important aspect of the event will not be the making available of a little extra information about women scientists, but the focus on women as Wikipedia editors.</p> <p>The dominance of men in the Wikipedia online community is well-documented and something that the company is attempting to address through its <a href=\"http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Gender_gap\" title=\"\">Gender Gap</a> project. While coming in somewhat ahead of the proportion of female fellows of the Royal Society, in 2009 female Wikipedians were only around <a href=\"http://grouplens.org/system/files/wp-gender-wikisym2011.pdf\" title=\"\">13% of the active community</a>.</p> <p>Research suggests that this matters for a number of reasons, principally that male and female editors tend to focus on different content areas, that the coverage of topics more likely to be of interest to female users of Wikipedia is seen as inferior, and that Wikipedia is missing out on the successful development of its social and community areas.</p> <p>There is also, particularly around more controversial topics, a tendency to macho behaviour among editors. Women, it turns out, are much less likely to edit articles in these areas and, if they do, their edits are more likely to be rejected. These rejections are often not to do with factual content, but differences in tone and approach.</p> <p>This experience means that these women are very likely to back away from the whole project. In other words, women's voices and views are seriously underrepresented, even when they might consider themselves experts in a particular area.</p> <p>The Royal Society's edit-a-thon will include a range of well-qualified and motivated women with an interest in making themselves, as well as women in the history of science, heard. Wikipedia will certainly benefit from developing an atmosphere that is more welcoming to women like these.</p>",

  "<p>Tripoli, 2011. The morning following the mortar attack \u2013 August 24 \u2013 it was safe enough to venture out into the streets. I headed to the office of Libya's government. A rebel showed me inside; it was as if the senior members of Gaddafi's government had just popped out for lunch. In the meeting room, someone had left a briefcase behind on the veneered oval table. A green sign in Arabic proclaimed: \"Dr Al-Baghdadi Ali Al-Mahmoudi, prime minister of Libya.\"</p> <p>Next to the now ghostly chair were places for the prime minister's colleagues: finance, education, the environment and fisheries. In an adjacent room the air conditioning softly hummed. Portraits of Libya's vanished dictator still hung on the walls. I discovered official papers that told their own story \u2013 petitions, a wedding invite, and a Libya investment report by Ernst &amp; Young (\"Quality In Everything We Do\"). It wasn't clear which minister had been perusing it. But the papers spoke of how rapidly Libya had reintegrated itself with the western commercial world, after the country's emergence from isolation and sanctions.</p> <p>In Al-Mahmoudi's private office I pilfered copies of secret US diplomatic cables concerning Libya, leaked in December 2010 by WikiLeaks, and seen by some as a catalyst for the Arab uprisings. The cables referenced the \"voluptuous blonde\" Ukrainian nurse who accompanied Gaddafi everywhere.</p> <p>At the time Gaddafi had dismissed the US state department reports as lies. But here they were, meticulously annotated into Arabic.</p> <p>The feelings of ordinary Libyans towards the Gaddafi regime and its missing representatives was best summed up by two pieces of graffiti written on the wall outside. One read: \"To hell with Gaddafi.\" The other: \"Down with frizzy head.\"</p> <p>The rebels may have dethroned Gaddafi. But the price had been high. I toured Tripoli's Italian-built central hospital, where doctors hadn't had time to tally up the dead. Corpses lay dumped next to the entrance in a stinking side-room. Several dozen fighters were killed in the ferocious battle for Bab al-Aziziya, Gaddafi's complex. Others with serious head and abdominal wounds slumbered in the intensive care unit; bandaged and gravely ill. The room was silent but for a rhythmic plink-plunking.</p> <p>Dr El-Mahdi, the hospital's orthopedic consultant, told me that Libyans supported Nato's decision to bomb government targets. They hadn't been duped by anti-western state propaganda: \"I think they [the allies] prevented Benghazi from eradication,\" he said. Libya's revolution was a continuation of earlier ones, said the doctor. \"This started from eastern Europe and then spread to the Balkans. Now it comes to our world. It will carry on through Africa and some other countries with dictators.\"</p> <p>At Tripoli's secret police headquarters nobody had turned up for work. Nor had anyone clocked in at the foreign ministry \u2013 a charming building on Tripoli's seafront, built in the 1960s by King Idris, the monarch whom Gaddafi deposed in September 1969 in a bloodless coup. I found the doors to the European Union section locked. A rebel tried unsuccessfully to prise a gold-framed portrait of Libya's former leader from the wall. Frustrated, he instead smashed the glass.</p> <p>A short walk from the foreign ministry was the residence of Britain's ambassador in Libya, a building trashed and looted in March 2011 while Gaddafi's soldiers looked on. The ornate metal gate was unlocked. I wandered inside. The art deco structure was now a spectacularly gutted ruin. Fire had completely razed the ground floor, debris covered the sweeping marble staircase. All that was left of Her Majesty's billiard table was a charred frame. Pieces of Minton bone china and the bottom of a Whittard teapot lay next to a ravaged dishwasher.</p> <p>Osama Mohamad, a marine scientist whose son had witnessed the destruction, showed me around. He said that Gaddafi's officials had encouraged locals to destroy and rob the property. Osama said he was disappointed by Britain's close relationship with Gaddafi, and by the invitation to Libya's ambassador \u2013 subsequently withdrawn \u2013 to attend Prince William's wedding. \"Gaddafi's been a dictator for 42 years. I don't accept it. I accept it from Italy but not from Britain,\" he said. He added: \"Tony Blair is an adviser to Gaddafi. It's strange.\"</p> <p>In the sunny courtyard were the remains of four burned-out cars. Round the back the ambassador's swimming pool was now an algae-infested pond. Vandals had smashed up the changing rooms \u2013 hurling a loo seat on the floor. A sign still read: \"Please shower before entering the pool.\" A second world war memorial to British troops who died fighting in the western desert against Rommel's Germans lay smashed in small chunks.</p> <p>Britain's ambassador Richard Northern and his family had clearly left in a hurry. The upstairs rooms were filled with papers he had been unable to take, as well as an unread copy of Martin Amis's novel The Information. The Tripoli Post was discarded on the floor, together with a Libya map (which I liberated) and \"Mastering Arabic\". A typed page left by one long-departed ambassador offered helpful hints on local customs. It lamented: \"The only real hardship is the total absence of a decent glass of wine in the entire British embassy, once the Christmas ration is finished.\"</p> <p>There was also a menu from a dinner given in honour of Charles Clarke \u2013 a sign of Britain's dubiously warm relations with Tripoli under the last British Labour government. Clarke, then home secretary, enjoyed spiced pumpkin soup with \"pan-friend Dentishi\" and \"North African lamb with couscous and mixed vegetables\". The wine situation had clearly improved in recent years: with the then Labour minister served a bottle of Chablis grand cru, as well as coffee and truffles. For most of Tripoli's residents, such opulence was unthinkable. Poverty was one of the key factors behind Libya's \"February 17\" revolution, in a country with enormous oil and gas reserves \u2013 in fact, the largest proven oil reserves on the African continent, with a whopping 43.6 billion barrels.</p> <p>At one rebel checkpoint I met a group of volunteers sitting on a superior black leather sofa. They had borrowed it from a nearby flat and parked it on the pavement. The rebels had also helped themselves to a coffee table.</p> <p>\"In our home we didn't have anything like this,\" Moaied al-Nadami, 30, explained, pointing to his new suite. \"Gaddafi has many expensive things. He spent our money on parties and buying guns.\" Al-Nadami said he worked as a dentist and lab technician. He showed off a 10mm revolver he had seized from Gaddafi's compound. \"I was there. We found many, many guns,\" he said.</p> <p>But while most rebels were friendly, some were not. In a warren of alleys near Gaddafi's compound one excited group demanded to see my ID and passport. The rebels were suspicious, hostile, and armed; they claimed they were looking for informers and traitors spying for Gaddafi's regime. \"How do we know you are not spies?\" one asked. In the days that followed \u2013 with Gaddafi toppled, but still alive and in hiding \u2013 his ruined complex became Libya's premier tourist attraction.</p> <p>The sprawling Bab al-Aziziya compound filled with cars as ordinary Libyans got their first opportunity to peer inside it. The main ceremonial building \u2013 stormed by the rebels and a bombed out wreck \u2013 echoed with crazy gunfire. Smiling locals took snaps on their mobile phones, or peered from the balcony at Tripoli's shimmering skyline. By the following summer, the compound would become an unofficial municipal rubbish dump, with a few intrepid squatters taking up residence in the former army mess.</p> <p>Just up a grassy knoll I joined other visitors to the discrete villa belonging to Saif al-Islam, who would later be captured in the desert by Zintani rebels. Dozens wandered in through the concealed entrance: two green doors led to a shady garden of figs and lime trees. Fires still burned. In one ravaged bedroom a man knocked on the wall. \"Are you there, Gaddafi?\" he joked.</p> <p>\"I'm taking photos to show to my brothers and family still in Tunisia,\" Salah Ermih explained, recording the ransacked interior on his mobile phone. Ermih, a surgeon, said he had dashed out from his overworked hospital to have a look. He added: \"A month ago I knew this would happen. Gaddafi was getting weaker and weaker.\" What would happen to Libya now? \"We should be a democracy. But in our own way.\"</p> <p>The villa spoke of a luxuriously European lifestyle \u2013 a state-of-the-art kitchen, a large store cupboard smelling pungently of looted spices, and a collection of videos. A DVD of the Hollywood film Open Season sat among the debris; on the floor of Saif's study was the cover from a January issue of The Economist. It read: \"The Eurocrisis, Time for Plan B\". Christmas cards addressed to Saif were scattered about.</p> <p>Some of those who turned up had brought their kids. Children leant through the back windows of saloon cars, waving V-signs. One of the most remarkable aspects of Gaddafi's compound was its sheer size: office and residential buildings dotted around an enormous four-kilometre grassy space, a city within a city. A thick forbidding wall sealed off the compound from ordinary citizens. It housed senior regime officials and the government's formidable security apparatus.</p> <p>Another newly popular attraction were the tunnels \u2013 a network of subterranean passages. Locals queued up to go inside via a small manhole and down a green ladder outside the building used by Gaddafi to show off American cruise missiles. The most accessible complex was something of a disappointment \u2013 though you could pop up pleasingly several hundred meters away, next to Saif al-Islam's grassy residence.</p> <p>There were few clues to where Gaddafi might be hiding. His regime had cynically built a children's fairground above the main tunnel entrance. The cups and saucers from one of the rides were intact, but the teapot had toppled over. The complex was strewn with the remnants of battle: bullets, crates used for mortars, expensive leather sofas stacked up in a lavish reception room as an improvised defensive wall, a dead kitten.</p> <p>\"Gaddafi is mafia! Gaddafi is Al Pacino!\" cried Omar Naaji as he and a group of rebels combed through a suite of trashed regime offices. A red-carpeted staircase led to an upper storey containing a barred interrogation area. \"This is where lots of people were arrested,\" Naaji said, showing off a security protocol detailing the names of those rounded up. \"My brother was held here two years ago. I've come to have a look,\" Walid Shara, 27, from Misrata, added.</p> <p>A large man burst into the office, incredulous he had penetrated into the heart of Gaddafi's fallen empire. \"Allahu Akbar!\" he shouted, dancing up and down. Minutes later he was frantically carrying box-files containing prisoner details to his car. \"I'm not a thief. I'm going to give these to Al-Jazeera,\" he insisted. \"I'm very happy. Gaddafi is finished.\"</p>",

  "<p>This year's Brand Licensing Europe event at Olympia is the 14th in its history. The world's biggest brands are here in force from the media, entertainment, sports and lifestyle sectors, with over 280 brand owners here showcasing over 2,200 brands, characters and images available for license.</p> <p>The premise of licensing is simple \u2013 I have a brand, you have a product that you believe can sell better through association with my brand, I agree and think fans of my brand will love it so we do a deal around some form of revenue-share and let's go. I can hear licensing professionals wincing as they read that but in principle that's it. Joining the brand owners and product creators are teams and teams of retail buyers from the powerhouses \u2013 Sainsburys, Tescos, Asda, Mothercare\u2026 the list goes on. They're here to discuss brand strategy with some of the worlds' biggest brands and to spot \"the next big thing\" that will drive retail sales over the coming 18 \u2013 24 months. Licensed products for Peter Jackson's The Hobbit, tick. The full range of products for FIFA 2014 World Cup, tick. Physical products for digital sensations like Angry Birds and Moshi Monsters, tick and tick.</p> <p>Here's five trends that I've identified from this year's show.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Licensing is increasing in importance as a revenue stream for all businesses, particularly those in the media and entertainment space. As established revenue streams, such as DVD sales, TV advertising and paid-media are challenged, licensing offers up an exciting new way to bring in revenue from fans. The world's biggest brands \u2013 World Cups, blockbuster films, hit TV shows, major sports teams and more \u2013 are investing in the development of powerful licensing campaigns to extend the reach and value of their brands</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> But its not just global businesses. Entrepreneurs are here too. One example is Hari's World: a cartoon character featuring in his own books to drive child safety awareness. Created by a father and son team, both of whom are experts in the risk business wanting to make a difference. One was a personal injury barrister and the other an ex-army major. They created the character to take children on adventures but to teach them to be safe along the way. It is now being distributed across Singapore and Malaysia, with further publishing licenses and distribution agreements being lined up for neighbouring regions. Meanwhile City of Friends is uniquely based on the adventures of real-life Norway state police officer Carl Christian Hamre. Hamre created bedtime stories for his young son based on his day job as a police officer and within four years, established CreaCon Group, one of Norway's largest independent children's entertainment production companies with businesses spanning television production, licensing, live events, music and digital operations.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Licensing is evident in how current / hyped brands of the moment are being extended. Examples include Caroline Mickler Ltd showcasing lingerie, sleepwear, apparel, bedding, home furnishings, stationery, jewellery and adult products for Fifty Shades of Grey. At the same time, CPLG is exploring opportunities for Downton Abbey and The Only Way Is Essex while FreeMantle Media is exploring opportunities with the X Factor &amp; Britain's got Talent.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> The return of classic brands: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are back as a highlight at this year's show, on the back of a new TV series and celebrating over 25 years since the characters' first appeared. They are joined by Roobarb &amp; Custard, Batfink, Garfield, Where's Wally (celebrating its 25th anniversary), Purple Ronnie (celebrating its 25th anniversary), My Little Pony, Transformers, Monopoly, Power Rangers (another 25th anniversary), R Whites lemonade and Rainbow which is 40 years old this year.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> There is an exciting future for licensing in mobile gaming which has emerged as an area of significant growth. People are interacting with gaming content in a different way on smartphones or tablets. With the forthcoming release of the Kindle Family Fire, this Christmas will see more tablets in UK households than ever before. Disney Mobile boasts award-winning studios that consistently develop chart-topping, critically-acclaimed apps. Disney is known for developing memorable characters and \"Where's My Water?\", which boasts Disney's first original game character, Swampy the alligator, is no exception. \"Where's My Water?\" has reached the Number 1 spot on the App Store in 90 different countries and also made App Store history as the 25 billionth app downloaded. In June 2012, Apple recognised the game with the Apple Design Award, awarded for innovation and design excellence in developer products.</p> <p>In this world where everyone is fighting for consumer attention, licensing is a way of extending the attention span. If a consumer loves your brand, they will want to spend more time with it. Licensing gives your brand the opportunity to increase the time a consumer spends with you. What's evident at Brand Licensing Europe is how you do this is limited only by your imagination, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit.</p> <p><em>Jessica Blue is event director at </em><a href=\"http://www.advanstar.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Advanstar Licensing</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up</strong></a><strong> for free membership to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Where do <a href=\"http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/butterfly/32/butterfly.html?butterflyid=38\" title=\"\">painted ladies</a> go when the summer ends? One of the great mysteries of the butterfly world has been solved by high-tech radar and 10,000 members of the public, who have tracked the butterfly on its epic autumn journey from the Arctic Circle to west Africa.</p> <p>For years, the arrival of painted ladies in Britain was thought to be an evolutionary dead-end. These colourful summer visitors would produce offspring that were believed to die in the autumn because our winters were too cold for the butterfly to survive. Unlike other migrants such as the <a href=\"http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/Butterfly/32/Butterfly.html?ButterflyId=43\" title=\"\">red admiral</a> which are regularly seen crossing the English Channel, there were almost no records of painted ladies making the reverse trip south to warmer climes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.07738.x/abstract\" title=\"\">A new study</a>, using a radar station in Hampshire and 60,000 sightings logged by volunteers in Britain and in 66 other countries and islands across Europe, has discovered the painted lady does successfully return to warmer climes, but flies at such high altitudes that it is not usually spotted.</p> <p>The radar, which can detect flying objects as small as an aphid at heights of up to 1.2km, found that painted ladies fly at an average altitude of more than 500m on their southbound odyssey and can reach 30mph \u2013 twice their normal flying speed \u2013 by choosing to migrate when the wind is favourable.</p> <p>The study, led by Spanish lepidopterist Constanti Stefanescu and a multinational team of experts from <a href=\"http://www.butterfly-conservation.org/\" title=\"\">Butterfly Conservation</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ceh.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology</a>, York University and <a href=\"http://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Rothamsted Research</a>, gathered data from 2009, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/27/painted-lady-butterflies-migration-britain\" title=\"\">the most recent boom year for painted ladies</a>. A wet winter in Morocco caused huge numbers of caterpillars to thrive on unusually lush vegetation and painted ladies swarmed north through Europe, breaching the Arctic Circle in northern Norway.</p> <p>The new study estimates that 11 million arrived in Britain and 29 million of their offspring departed southwards \u2013 to France and Spain \u2013 at the end of the summer.</p> <p>Rather than hibernate, adult painted ladies are constantly on the move to find optimum breeding conditions after which their offspring take up the migratory baton. Up to six generations make the 9,000-mile (14,480km) round trip from Africa to northern Europe and back again each year.</p> <p>\"This tiny creature weighing less than a gram with a brain the six of a pin head and no opportunity to learn from older, experienced individuals, undertakes an epic intercontinental migration in order to find plants for its caterpillars to eat,\" said <a href=\"http://twitter.com/RichardFoxBC\" title=\"\">Richard Fox</a> of Butterfly Conservation and a co-author of the study published in the international journal <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1600-0587\" title=\"\">Ecography</a>.</p> <p>\"Once thought to be blindly led, at the mercy of the wind, into an evolutionary dead end in the lethal British winter, this amazing combination of mass-participation citizen science and cutting edge technology has shown painted ladies to be sophisticated travellers.\"</p> <p>According to Fox, the study data showed painted ladies chose to fly at times and at altitudes when the winds would be in their favour. Previous studies have shown that new generations of painted ladies know to fly southwards in the autumn and north in the spring because of shortening or lengthening days.</p>",
  "<p>Traders have been looking for the next industrial group to warn on earnings after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/12/morgan-crucible-warning-engineering?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">downbeat statements from the likes of Cookson and Morgan Crucible</a>.</p> <p><strong>Spectris</strong>, the testing and controls equipment group, was expected to join the club, given the global economic downturn. Instead it has issued an upbeat statement and its shares have rebounded sharply.</p> <p>Its sales increased by 12% during the last quarter, including a contribution from recent acquisitions which was offset by a negative currency effect. At constant currency rates sales were up 2%, albeit this was a slowdown on the first half. It said: </p> <blockquote> Spectris remains well positioned to deliver on its expectations for the year as it realises both the benefits of its recent acquisitions, especially Omega, and the increase in the proportion of resilient revenues generated in the business. <br> </blockquote> <p>That was enough to soothe the nerves, and the company's shares have jumped by nearly 11%, adding 170p to \u00a317.64 and leading the FTSE 250 risers. (As it happens the shares had fallen 11% or so since the Cookson warning). Andy Douglas at Jefferies said: </p> <blockquote> This is a resilient performance and better than many will have feared, with slower growth versus the first half of 2012, reflecting the macro-economic environment - this has been anticipated by the market. The outlook statement is 'in-line' for the full year, and whilst the top-end of consensus may be trimmed, we firmly reiterate our Buy recommendation. </blockquote>",

  "<p>Ireland's one-time richest man Sean Quinn is in court where he will find out if a state-owned bank wants him jailed.</p> <p>The former billionaire's son, Sean Junior, will also hear how the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) wants the courts to deal with him.</p> <p>Earlier in the summer both father and son, along with Sean Quinn's nephew Peter Darragh Quinn, were found guilty of contempt of court for moving assets which the IBRC wanted to seize out of the state.</p> <p>Sean Quinn Junior was jailed for three months while his cousin fled to Northern Ireland where he remains and cannot be extradited back to Dublin.</p> <p>The judge in the case back in June adjourned the punishment for Sean Quinn Senior. The Quinn family has admitted it put millions worth of property and other assets beyond the reach of the former Anglo Irish Bank, which is now owned by the taxpayer.</p> <p>The bank says it has security over the assets and that the family owes it \u20ac2.8bn (\u00a32.3bn). The family is alleging the bulk of the loans are tainted with illegality as they are linked to a share support scheme for Anglo Irish Bank.</p> <p>The case centres on hundreds of millions of euros the Quinn family borrowed from Anglo Irish Bank to fund a global property portfolio.</p>",
  "<p>Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, has plans to become 100% powered by renewable and low-carbon forms of energy, according to an influential member of the royal family.</p> <p>But the process is likely to take decades, and some observers are sceptical as to whether it is any more than window-dressing.</p> <p>Prince <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turki_bin_Faisal_Al_Saud\" title=\"\">Turki Al Faisal Al Saud</a>, founder of the <a href=\"http://www.kff.com/\" title=\"\">King Faisal Foundation</a> and one of the state's top spokesmen, told the <a href=\"http://www.global-economic-symposium.org/\" title=\"\">Global Economic Symposium</a> in Brazil that he hoped the kingdom might be powered entirely by low-carbon energy within his lifetime \u2013 he is 67 \u2013 but that he thought it was likely to take longer.</p> <p>However, he insisted Saudi was moving ahead with investment in renewable energy, nuclear power and other alternatives to fossil fuels and that it could use its vast oil reserves for other goods, such as plastics and polymers.</p> <p>\"Oil is more precious for us underground than as a fuel source,\" he said. \"If we can get to the point where we can replace fossil fuels and use oil to produce other products that are useful, that would be very good for the world. I wish that may be in my lifetime, but I don't think it will be.\"</p> <p>Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"It speaks volumes that a Saudi prince can see the benefits of switching to clean energy sources when [UK chancellor] George Osborne seemingly cannot, but Saudi Arabia will only truly be a green economy when it leaves its fossil fuels in the ground.\"</p> <p>Saudi Arabia's energy use is almost entirely from fossil fuels at present, with about two-thirds coming from oil and the remainder from gas. The state produces close to 12m barrels of oil a day, representing more than 12% of world crude production, and has about one-fifth of the world's oil reserves, according to the US government's Energy Information Administration. Energy use per person within the kingdom is also high by world standards, because energy prices are kept so low.</p> <p>As Prince Turki noted, however, the kingdom has vast potential for using solar power. \"The cost of solar energy is now 15% of what it was 20 years ago,\" he noted. Saudi Arabia has also signed memoranda of understanding \u2013 though no final deal as yet \u2013 with Argentina over nuclear energy.</p> <p>But despite his commitment to advancing renewable energy in the Middle East, Prince Turki \u2013 who served as director of Saudi Arabia's intelligence services for more than 20 years and has also been an ambassador to the UK and the US \u2013 was also clear that the rest of the world was likely to continue to rely on fossil fuels for many years to come. \"No country can ban itself from any one form of energy,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the other potentially important technologies for Saudi Arabia is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/10/carbon-capture-storage\" title=\"\">carbon capture and storage</a>, as depleted oil fields could be used as storage for compressed carbon dioxide, but it has so far made little progress. The prince said the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology should be seen as an international effort rather than the responsibility of single countries.</p> <p>Nebjsa Nakicenovic, deputy chief of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, said CCS was likely to be a vital technology around the world. Though he acknowledged there could be problems, as the technology is still unproven, he warned: \"Do not discount CCS.\"</p> <p>On renewables, Nakicenovic said the world should aim to generate 30% of energy from sustainable renewable sources by 2030. That would represent more than a doubling of current renewable energy usage, because although on paper about 15% of energy now comes from renewable sources, this includes a large amount of biomass \u2013 mostly wood, dung and other waste \u2013 burned in developing countries. Much of this is unsustainable, and requires a significant use of resources in foraging for firewood. \"So [the target] is very ambitious, but doable,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Despite the ever-increasing importance of an online presence for businesses of all sizes and descriptions, many smaller businesses are not adjusting their strategy accordingly. In fact, according to a recent <a href=\"http://www.basekit.com/digital-dinosaurs\" title=\"\">research report</a>, a massive 60% of small businesses in the UK still have no online presence at all.</p> <p>But why is this significant? Does it even matter?</p> <p>Many small business owners view their business as a totally offline entity, pursuing traditional means to promote themselves and win new customers. However, regarding any business (from the largest enterprise to the sole trader, or anything in between) as purely offline is a risky strategy to take when your customers are spending more and more of their time online.</p> <p>Harnessing the web as a business tool is important, even for businesses that may consider themselves as primarily offline. Beauty businesses, fitness businesses, plumbers, driving instructors and any number of other service businesses ultimately all measure success by their ability to build offline relationships \u2013 and the web can play a huge part in that. So no matter how established your businesses is offline, it's crucial to get the basics of online in place.</p> <p>As a small business, it's unlikely you'll have big budgets, staff or free personnel hours to invest in a complex online strategy, but there are certainly some simple steps you can take to start reaping the rewards that the web can bring.</p> <h2><strong>1. Be accessible</strong><br></h2> <p>The key to making the most of the web is making your business as accessible as possible, letting people interact with you in a way that suits them, whenever they want to. Your customers are online 24/7, and as such they expect to be able to interact with businesses and organisations whenever and wherever they are online. Of course, that doesn't mean having to have a presence on every single online channel; it means being clever about selecting the ones that are most important to your audience.</p> <p>At the most fundamental level, this means a basic, professional looking website with easy to find, relevant information about your business. At a more advanced level, that could be a fully-blown booking tool that lets customers schedule their own appointment or booking with you, essentially giving your businesses a 24/7 receptionist.</p> <h2><strong>2) Think local before you think big</strong></h2> <p>Making the most of online tools doesn't necessarily mean trying to go global, quite the opposite in fact. It can be a very successful route to building relationships at a local level, which is crucial to the success of so many small businesses. Focusing on your online touchpoints means building relationships with customers and potential customers, and turning that online connection into offline custom: loyal, engaged customers who come back time and again. Think also about local listings sites, online networking groups and building partnerships with other local business.</p> <h2><strong>3) Think multi-channel \u2013 but focus on the ones that really matter</strong></h2> <p>One of the first things to consider is through which online channels to make your business visible. Yes, your website is your flagship, but you need to get your brand to where your potential customers are. As a small business, you likely don't have either the time or resources to do everything, and investing in a fruitless channel can end up being a costly mistake. Think hard about where your customers are spending their time online, and focus your efforts accordingly.</p> <h2><strong>4) Nurture your loyal customers \u2013 turn them into advocates</strong><br></h2> <p>Finally, think about how you can use your most loyal customers to do your online marketing for you. Social media has changed the way people make recommendations and share their experiences. Weary of the constant bombardment of marketing messages \u2013 and with a whole internet of opinions, rants (and even occasionally praise!) at our fingertips \u2013 we now just have to turn to Facebook or Twitter for advice. A business can be made or broken in minutes. The mass adoption of online social networks has changed the way we make purchasing decisions. Businesses of all sizes, no matter how small, can capitalise on that. Best of all, these social recommendations are super-targeted, personal and free.</p> <p>To sum up, big impact doesn't have to mean big budget when it comes to the web. It's all about being relevant, consistent and accessible online. Keep these three things in mind and you'll be well on the way to succeeding in using the web to create a slick, professional window display for your offline business.</p> <p><em>Glenn Shoosmith is founder and chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.bookingbug.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BookingBug</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<h2>Alan Clarke at Scotiabank</h2> <p>This is a welcome outcome following a poor start to the fiscal year. It doesn't undo the bad start, but it does nonetheless highlight that it would be wrong to extrapolate the deteriorating trend in the public finances from earlier in the year.</p> <p>After a poor first four months of the year when borrowing was higher than a year earlier, this has now reversed and borrowing is falling relative to the same month a year earlier.</p> <p>Given that GDP growth is likely to be around 1% point slower than the OBR projection, the usual rules of thumb would suggest that borrowing should be around \u00a37.5bn higher than projected. So realistically, we are probably not going to maintain this pace of improvement and a full-year borrowing figure of close to \u00a3100bn is looking more likely.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the public finances are not looking like the disaster that they previously did.</p> <h2>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The chancellor now has a slim \u2013 rather than seemingly no \u2013 chance of meeting his fiscal targets for 2012/13, but he will need the economy to achieve clear growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 after a highly probable return to growth in the third quarter. This won't be easy.</p> <p>More likely is that the chancellor will miss his PSNBR target for 2012/13 by some \u00a35-10bn. This would not be nearly as bad as looked likely even last month, but it is still an uncomfortable situation for Mr Osborne.</p> <p>With the chancellor still set to miss his 2012/13 fiscal targets and with the GDP growth forecasts for both the near and the medium-term looking optimistic, it is still probable that Mr Osborne in his autumn statement will either have to acknowledge that he is unlikely to be able to start bringing down debt as a percentage of GDP by 2015/16 or announce further fiscal tightening measures. Neither are an appetising prospect for the chancellor, but we suspect he will go for the former while stressing his commitment to reining in the public finances through the life of this parliament and beyond.</p> <h2>Philip Rush, UK economist, Nomura</h2> <p>In this one fell swoop, the ONS has fundamentally changed the scale of fiscal slippage this year. The ONS had been cautioning the quality of its data on central government expenditure because of a change to the reporting system for government departments. But only half of the revision was caused by central government, while local government caused all the surprise for September alone.</p> <h2>Martin Beck, UK economist, Capital Economics</h2> <p>September's UK public finances brought some better news for the chancellor after the run of poor borrowing numbers earlier in the year. Nevertheless, if the trend in the first six months of the fiscal year continues, it still looks like borrowing for 2012/13 will overshoot the OBR's forecast of \u00a3120bn (excluding Royal Mail effects) by about \u00a37bn. Given this deterioration and increasing concerns over the true impact of deficit reduction on the economy, the chancellor may be compelled to alter his fiscal rules at December's autumn statement.</p>",

  "<p>At some point this year, somewhere in the US, a teenage girl will decide she wants to have sex. She might not know when, or who with, but she has made that choice. Unfortunately for her, this is a turbulent and uncertain year to be making sexual and reproductive health choices in the US.</p> <p>If a student, she might have been relieved when Barack Obama's <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Affordable Care Act</a> passed in June, knowing she can access student health plans that provide free contraception. She may already be benefiting from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/teenpregnancy/PreventTeenPreg.htm\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Initiative</a> launched by Obama in 2010, which funds school sex education programmes that show evidence of success, those predominantly promoting contraception over abstinence.</p> <p>But this is an election year and early in 2012 voters got an idea of what to expect from the Republicans' presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, when he challenged contraceptive coverage included in the health reforms. Along with many Republicans, Romney supported an amendment that would exempt employers with moral objections from including contraception in employees' health plans. Though the amendment failed, Romney promised to not only \"undo\" the contraceptive mandate but to repeal the entire act on his first day in office.</p> <p>\"They could starve it financially, cripple it even if they can't repeal entirely,\" explains Adam Sonfield, of the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guttmacher Institute</a>, which specialises in sexual and reproductive health and rights. \"There are lots of opportunities to do damage.\"</p> <p>Whatever the route, his point is clear: as president, Romney will do all he can to ensure federal money isn't spent providing contraceptives.</p> <p>Voters could be forgiven for thinking Romney is less clear on abortion. When running for Senate in 1994 he said he believed \"abortions should be safe and legal in this country\". Now he wants <a href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roe v Wade</a>, the court decision that legalised abortion nationally, overturned and would make further substantial cuts to reproductive health services, despite a federal ban on funding abortion.</p> <p>\"Republican and independent-leaning women may believe Romney is the man he said he was in 1994, but he's not,\" says Emilie Ailts, director of campaign group <a href=\"http://www.prochoicecolorado.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado</a>. \"If he gets to the White House he will defund Planned Parenthood.\"</p> <p>Whereas pro-choice Obama refused to bow down to Republican <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/government-shutdown-sticking-point-planned-parenthood/story?id=13328560\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">threats in 2011 to shut down government</a> unless funding was cut to <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planned Parenthood</a>, Romney promises the opposite.

A fiscal conservative driven by pro-life ideology, Ryan co-sponsored a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/11/paul-ryan-personhood_n_1767760.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">federal measure to ban abortion in all cases</a> and is consistent with his position.</p> <p>\"Ryan practices what Romney preaches: Romney has pledged to 'get rid of Planned Parenthood'; Ryan voted repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood. Romney said he would end the Title X program that funds birth control and cancer screenings; Ryan voted to eliminate Title X,\" says Ailts.</p> <p>The Guttmacher Institute estimates the <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Title X family planning programme</a> is used by 25% of poor women wanting to obtain contraceptives and is vital to reduce unintended pregnancies. Obama wants more funding for this programme but Romney wants it axed and would also cut the widely used Medicaid programme through which low income women receive reproductive healthcare.</p> <p>Programmes promoting safe sex among young people could also be at risk under Romney, who supports sex education based on abstinence until marriage and funded such programmes when governor of Massachusetts. According to Douglas Kirby, senior research scientist at health and education research non-profit <a href=\"http://www.etr.org/home\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">ETR Associates</a>, Obama's pregnancy initiative is likely to reduce unprotected sex. The opposite could happen if the focus returns to abstinence.</p> <p>\"Because abstinence programs are generally less effective at reducing sexual risk, if they are promoted instead of comprehensive programs, more young people will probably engage in unprotected sex and teen pregnancy and STI rates will be a little higher than they otherwise would be,\" says Kirby.</p> <p>On some youth reproductive health policies, the candidates stand closer together. Last year, going against scientific advice, Obama restricted giving emergency contraception over-the-counter to under 17-year-olds unless they had a doctor's prescription. As a father of two daughters the decision to him was \"common sense\". Romney vetoed emergency contraceptive legislation in Massachusetts because it \"disregarded the importance of parental involvement\". Neither helps young girls wanting to discreetly access the morning-after pill.</p> <p>Overwhelmingly though, Romney would cause bigger problems for reproductive rights in the US and internationally. He promises to reinstate the \"<a href=\"http://www.genderhealth.org/the_issues/us_foreign_policy/global_gag_rule/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Global Gag rule</a>\", a policy that prohibits international organisations receiving US funds from providing any abortion-related care. The rule, rescinded by Obama on his second day, has been an early act of every new party president since introduced in 1984 and has big repercussions.</p> <p>Improving access to reproductive services is key to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/maternal.shtml\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">millennium development goal 5</a> \u2013 the target to improve maternal health. With this target lagging, there is a pressing urgency to ensure it is at the top of the agenda as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">discussions begin on future development goals</a>.</p> <p>As a member of the UN, the US will contribute to negotiations about the post-2015 development agenda, which will steer a course for future sustainable development. But in contrast to Obama, a Romney administration is unlikely to recognise that a lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services only worsens cycles of poverty \u2013 at home and abroad.</p>",
  "<p>UK foreign aid has been in the news recently, with international development secretary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/09/justine-greening-uk-aid-budget\" title=\"\">Justine Greening promising increased scrutiny</a> of the Department for International Development's (DfID) spending record, and debate about the growing aid budget.

How should DfID work with governments that have weak human rights records? Should it focus on the poorest countries or the poorest people (who predominantly live in middle-income countries)?</p> <p>This scrutiny of UK aid has revived old debates. In the 1990s, the <a href=\"http://www.wdm.org.uk/past-campaign/tied-aid-and-development-pergau-dam\" title=\"\">Pergau dam scandal</a> \u2013 UK aid for the hydroelectric project in Malaysia was linked to a major arms deal \u2013 raised questions about who was benefiting from UK funds. Ten years ago, the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/1/contents\" title=\"\">2002 International Development Act</a> legislated that UK aid focus explicitly on reducing poverty and be delinked from trade, commercial or other political goals. DfID, meanwhile, is only 15 years old: previously aid was managed by the Foreign Office.</p> <p>We'll be discussing these issues and more in October's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/series/global-development-podcast\" title=\"\">Global development podcast</a>, looking at the politics of UK aid, how it's changed over the past two decades and what will be the coalition government's legacy to the aid programme.</p> <p>As always, we want your comments to be part of the conversation, chaired this month by the Guardian's diary editor and Politics Weekly presenter <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/hughmuir\" title=\"\"><strong>Hugh Muir</strong></a>.

  "<p>If <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9602888/Ex-police-licensing-officer-helps-bid-for-first-24-hour-strip-club.html\" title=\"\">one strip club gets its way</a>, it'll be offering lap dances 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The effort by the London-based Spearmint Rhino has caused a high-profile controversy, with local residents complaining the club's non-stop stripping proposition will increase crime. Bob Dear, a retired member of the Metropolitan police, is leading the bid. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear. The global economy may be struggling, but it appears the demand for nude dancers is never-ending. For many of today's 20-something men, going to a strip club is as normal as going to the neighbourhood pub.</p> <p>For the past year, I've been running <a href=\"http://lettersfromstripclubs.blogspot.com\" title=\"\">Letters From Men Who Go To Strip Clubs</a>, a digital project that features 31 anonymous emails (so far) from men revealing the intimate reasons why they seek out strippers. What motivates men to go to strip clubs varies across generations, but in talking recently with young men, I've learned that, for them, watching nude women dance is a rite of passage as common as a first kiss.</p> <p>Once upon a time, strip clubs were patronised by businessmen looking for an after-work release and older men looking to get off ogling women who offered the promise of escape from reality. Nowadays, young men live in a culture saturated with sexuality, where porn is available at the click of a mouse, and hip-hop videos are raunchier than the racy movies playing on the soft-core cable channels. These young men came of age in a culture where sex is no longer taboo and porn is available 24/7. The mass dissemination of adult content across the globe has rendered strip clubs no big deal for these young men.</p> <p>\"It's unquestionably more 'normal' for guys than it was before,\" a 27-year-old New Yorker who works in advertising told me. A Washington DC policy analyst in his early 30s who went to strip clubs as often as two or three times a week during his 20s confirmed: \"Our society has become so hyper-sexualised that [going to strip clubs] almost seems tame.\" A 29-year-old \"strip club fan\" reported: \"I wouldn't say it's taboo at all.\"</p> <p>According to Bubbles, a self-described \"career stripper\" who co-founded the sex worker-run <a href=\"http://titsandsass.com\" title=\"\">Tits and Sass</a>, most men venture into strip clubs to fulfil the same basic needs. \"Stimulation, relaxation, escape, human touch \u2013 those aren't age dependent,\" she notes. Today's young men are better customers, she says, because \"they aren't as entitled as the older guys\" who \"think that strippers should let them do whatever they want, for cheap\" \u2013 a change she attributes in part to feminism and younger men \"being raised [in a] post-women's lib era\".</p> <p>Is it good or bad that for young men, going to a strip club is the new normal? I'd venture that it's a good thing. It's a place where they can step outside the anxiety-fraught dating scene and talk to a woman who, as long as he keeps tipping, will give him the time of day. It's a world where women parade around nude or nearly so in which doing so doesn't get anybody arrested or elicit gasps. It's a private room wherein a lap dance is on the table and a man expressing his sexuality isn't going to be met with a sexual harassment lawsuit.</p> <p>Rather than <a href=\"http:// www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-19910064\" title=\"\">criminalising male desire by banning strip clubs</a>, as a city council in Portsmouth is debating whether or not to do, we would be better served by admitting that male sexual fantasies are complex and not infrequently politically incorrect. That these young men are able to explore their sexuality safely and consensually is progress, not the downfall of the 21st century male.</p>",
  "<p>The call for reform started in Jordan well before the Arab spring. However, it has intensified since \u2013 not only because of the Arab revolutions, but also in response to widespread state corruption. Jordan's reformers are demanding constitutional changes; in particular, changes to our election law so that a truly representative parliament is possible, together with an elected prime minister who is accountable to parliament.</p> <p>The national demonstrations that took place earlier this month exposed the attitude of Jordanian officials toward reform. The demonstration was organised by the Muslim Brotherhood together with more than 70 independent initiatives. The announcement that the opposition was to hold a peaceful demonstration was met with a concerted campaign to disrupt it. The media even reported that radioactive pollution was present in the area of the demonstration. Various officials prepared a counter demonstration under the title \"Loyalty to the King\" in the same place, and at the same time.</p> <p>However, the demonstration went ahead \u2013 the largest in the country's history \u2013 putting Jordan on the path of true reform. What is most striking is that this large attendance was drawn from all parts of the country \u2013 cities, villages, Bedouin centres and refugee camps \u2013 and included many women. The official response had been designed to instil fear; it failed. Many in Jordan now speak of this demonstration as the beginning of the Jordanian spring.</p> <p>Just days after the demonstration, the newly appointed prime minister, Abdullah Al-Nsour, declared there were to be no changes to the election law, a key reform demand. This did little to relieve the tension. Just as 2011 witnessed the formation of four different governments in Jordan, so this year will end with at least three governments, with the dissolution of two parliaments before the end of their terms \u2013 a clear indication of political instability. The regime has no clear exit plan from this crisis.</p> <p>The need for reform is clear, but the regime does not want to accept it. This is obvious, not only in the way it dealt with the demonstration, but also in its dealings with its own representatives. The king had said he would be the guarantor of the findings of the Committee of National Dialogue which was formed and headed by Tahir al-Masri, the head of the appointed upper house of parliament. But instead the king insisted on the electoral law that was issued by the <a href=\"http://www.gid.gov.jo/en/home.html\" title=\"\">General Intelligence</a>, not that which was issued by the committee. Those who participated in this committee were betrayed, as was the prime minster at the time, Awn Al-Khasawneh, who resigned refusing to allow the passage of laws formulated by the intelligence services.</p> <p>The opposition is now faced with the choice of remaining in the street, or entering the elections. We have chosen to remain in the streets until genuine reform is achieved \u2013 the forthcoming elections have been manipulated even before they begin, and will be directed by a committee headed by Abdul Ilah al-Khateeb, a former minister in the government that forged the 2007 elections.</p> <p>Our regime is good at talking about reform. As for reform itself, it still has a long way to go. The Arab spring was used to spread fear among the people. The regime continues to scare the west, too, pointing to the rise of the Islamists after the rise of the Arab spring.</p> <p>The fact that Bashar al-Assad continues in office, despite his savagery, has also given a boost to Jordan's repressive regime. And having seen that the world does not call to account Assad, we in the Jordanian opposition have deep doubts about the true intentions of the American and British troops who were reported to be on Jordanian soil. They claim they are providing \"protection to Jordan from Syrian spillover\", but we oppose any foreign troops on our land, and consider this a clear violation of Jordanian sovereignty.</p> <p>In Jordan, the regime has not shed blood; it pursues a strategy of \"clean repression\". Regrettably, the victory of Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections was used as an excuse to forge the Jordanian elections in 2007. That was not a one-off: the Palestinian intifada was also used as an excuse to suspend parliamentary life for two years, during which time the government issued 200 temporary laws in the absence of a parliament. Today the Arab spring is used as an excuse to delay, rather than accelerate, reform.</p> <p>Even so, in the absence of bloodshed there is still hope. In our monarchical system, reform is possible, and we have a history of reform that we can build upon. In the 1950s, a constitution was enacted and a parliamentary government was formed. In 1989, the Islamic Movement participated as a partner in the government and led a programme of democratic transformation.</p> <p>The monarchical system is able to benefit from global experience \u2013 most notably, perhaps, that of King Juan Carlos and the transition to democracy in Spain. Ironically, the late King Hussein Bin Talal said in 1989 that he wanted to do as his friend, Juan Carlos, had done, but democratic transformation was aborted because of external factors, among them the Gulf war and the Wadi Araba Treaty with Israel. We hope that this time reform will be realised with transition to a genuine constitutional monarchy. The decision is still in the hands of the king, who today holds absolute power.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Describe your role in one sentence</strong><br>I manage a team that leads, supports, protects, represents and cares for more than 12,000 community pharmacies across the UK.</p> <p><strong>Why did you want to work in healthcare?</strong><br>From a young age, I wanted to do something that made a difference to the health and wellbeing of others. Community pharmacy is a fascinating sector to work in, sitting where heath and social care meet. Pharmacists and their staff generally see more patients more frequently than other healthcare professionals. During my 30 years as a practising pharmacist, I developed a rapport with patients and would often be the first port of call on health and wellbeing matters. This was particularly important in the deprived areas I worked in, where access to other healthcare professionals was difficult.</p> <p><strong>How do you want to see the sector change in the next five years?</strong><br>To become fully integrated into the health and public health network and to be recognised, commissioned and appropriately remunerated for providing services to the communities it serves. We also want the government and other public agencies to cut the red tape in our sector so that pharmacists can spend more time doing what they do best \u2013 delivering patient care.</p> <p><strong>Finish these sentences ...</strong></p> <p><strong>My proudest achievement at work was ...</strong> being appointed as the chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.npa.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Pharmacy Association</a> (NPA) and being recognised by my peers as a Fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.</p> <p><strong>The most difficult thing I've dealt with at work is ...</strong> speaking to NPA members who are struggling financially, especially in Northern Ireland. It is hard speaking to members who are on the brink of shut-down and knowing that patients will ultimately be the ones to suffer by not having access to pharmacies in their community.</p> <p><strong>I think the Health and Social Care Act is ...</strong> good in aspiration, but there is still more work to be done. The NHS Commissioning Board must recognise the government's publicly stated intention that pharmacists be involved in commissioning decisions. Clinical commissioning groups are developing their structures, staffing and culture and they should not wait until their go-live date in April 2013 to think about proper and full clinical engagement across all professions.</p> <p><strong>The people I work with ...</strong> are inspiring.</p> <p><strong>I do what I do because ... </strong>I care. As clich\u00e9d as this sounds, I have a real passion for community pharmacy and cannot imagine working in any other sector.</p> <p><strong>Sometimes people think that ...</strong> I expect too much of them, but I just want them to achieve their potential. This includes both staff at the NPA and pharmacists and their teams at the coal face.</p> <p><strong>Right now I want to ...</strong> do a lot more. I'm sure this is an ethos of many in the healthcare sector, where the newly reformed structures will be presenting challenges and opportunities.</p> <p><strong>At work I am always learning ...</strong> that everyone is different and deserves respect.</p> <p><strong>If I could go back ten years and meet my former self I'd tell them ...</strong> to just do what you believe is the right thing and do it now.</p> <p><strong>What is the best part of your job?</strong><br>Getting out into pharmacies and speaking with our members. I still locum occasionally at the weekends to help me keep in touch with the issues affecting pharmacists.</p> <p><strong>What is the worst part of your job?</strong><br>Being away from my family so much.</p> <p><strong>What makes you smile?</strong><br>Experiencing new places, sounds, images, tastes and things to do with my family and friends</p> <p><strong>What keeps you awake at night?</strong><br>Worrying about others, their health and their happiness.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/healthcare/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers. </strong></p>",
  "<p>Social enterprise is attracting meritocrats \u2013 people with achievements from different walks of life. Energy to do good and to do well at the same time is admirable. The influx of talent brings resources and challenges mediocrity, yet our 'merits' in one field may not help in others.</p> <p>Most social enterprises exist to help people left behind by our meritocratic world. Those who have lived the problem may have better solutions than meritocratic entrepreneurs. Good people doing smart things may have more impact than smart people doing good things.</p> <p>Those of us who have grown up in meritocracies can have blind spots in social enterprise. Consider three mistakes we make.</p> <p>First, we push small social enterprises to scale up when sometimes a spread of smaller organisations would have more impact. Some social enterprises need to grow to reap economies of scale: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" title=\"\">Wikipedia</a> has global reach, and the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operative</a> needs to be large to purchase efficiently. But many social enterprises are more effective if they are small and local.</p> <p>Crime reduction programmes flourish or fail neighbourhood by neighbourhood. Business discovered years ago that small can be beautiful: small firms create more jobs and growth than large companies. The <a href=\"http://www.the-icsf.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Social Franchising</a> is helping good ideas spread without big bureaucracies. An ecosystem of small community-based organisations, though, is messy and chaotic. Meritocrats tend to like things neat and tidy.</p> <p>Second, we spend more time on capital than on revenue. We are excited by the opportunities to create new instruments such as social investment bonds, or new legal forms such as community interest companies. The government has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/apr/04/david-cameron-big-society-fund\" title=\"\">invested \u00a3600m</a> into \"Big Society Capital\". Yet most social enterprises have little revenue, or any chance of it, and become charities addicted to gaining more donations.</p> <p>For a social enterprise to stand on its own feet, it needs revenue: fees, contracts or sales. Working to make a social enterprise pay can be harder and more boring than attracting capital. Procurement processes designed for large suppliers can wear down small organisations. Services for the disadvantaged often need government money, but civil servants prefer to purchase from 'one-stop shops': large companies such as <a href=\"http://www.serco.com/\" title=\"\">Serco</a> or <a href=\"http://www.g4s.com/\" title=\"\">G4S</a>.</p> <p>Third, we favour our own. We shine the light on meritocratic entrepreneurs with linear logic. Meritocrats in government and philanthropy give support, contracts and capital to those they trust. Trustees are usually well-spoken and well-heeled. Awards ceremonies can show a hierarchy, with the great and the good at the top, the entrepreneur in the middle, and the 'beneficiaries' at the bottom. Yet merit on one field may not play well on another.</p> <p>I have two dyslexic friends who struggled at school, but are now great social entrepreneurs: one shunned academic learning, but flourished in the more practical <a href=\"http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Clore Social Leadership Programme</a>. Non-profit chief executives on four continents have asked me: \"Why do the business people on my board check their brains at the door?\" With the best will in the world, we can disempower the very communities we try to help.</p> <p>It's ironic that a social entrepreneur coined the word 'meritocracy' in the 1950s to warn that a world led by merit could be as harsh as one ruled by class or money. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Young,_Baron_Young_of_Dartington\" title=\"\">Michael Young</a>, dubbed \"probably the world's greatest entrepreneur of social enterprises\", forecast a society with increasing differences in wealth and greater disdain for working-class people. He had written the 1945 Labour manifesto, but suspected that making 'equality of opportunity' an ideal could make the party more technocratic than democratic.</p> <p>I'm a product of the 1950s myself. I like how London has become cleaner, more prosperous and a melting pot for all kinds of people. I was proud to see the Olympic welcome. But I do not like the changes that Young prophesied: increasing income inequality, declining social mobility and a popular scorn for working-class people, who are labelled 'chavs'.</p> <p>Based in Bethnal Green, Young helped spawn dozens of organisations, such as Which?, The Open University and the School for Social Entrepreneurs. I am a fellow of The Young Foundation, which tries to keep up what he started.</p> <p>Young did not dislike meritocrats \u2013 he had risen on his own merits. He just believed that the best way to solve social problems was to give power to those with the problem, who are rarely meritocrats themselves. He questioned meritocracy. Let's all question our own merits.</p> <p><em>Jon Huggett is a visiting fellow at the </em><a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/centres/skoll/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship</em></a><em>, and founder of The Third Foundation, where he advises social enterprise leaders worldwide.
