  "<p><a href=\"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/chemistry/staff/profiles/anthony_ryan\" title=\"\">Tony Ryan</a> is professor of physical chemistry at Sheffield University. He is particularly interested in polymers and soft nanotechnology. Together with the <a href=\"http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/whatson/onthesoapbox\" title=\"\">fashion designer Helen Storey</a> he is developing a laundry additive called <a href=\"http://www.catalytic-clothing.org/\" title=\"\">Catclo</a> that sticks to the surface fibres of clothes and reacts with airborne nitrogen oxides to neutralise them. Air pollution in British cities causes thousands of deaths every year from asthma, lung disease and heart attacks. In London alone, nitrogen dioxide pollution is said to cause <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/30/london-air-quality-premature-deaths\" title=\"\">an extra 4,000 deaths a year</a>.</p> <p>Catclo is in the final stage of development and Ryan and Storey hope that it will be added to as many washing detergents as possible. They are in talks with a number of manufacturers and the cleaning products company Ecover is testing the additive.</p> <p><strong>How does Catclo work?</strong></p> <p>Catclo contains nanoparticles of titanium a thousand times thinner than a human hair. When clothes are washed with Catclo these particles are deposited on to the fibres of the fabric. When the catalysed clothes are worn, light shines on the titanium particles and it excites the electrons on the particle surface. The excited electrons try to react with something and the first thing that they see is oxygen because it's in the air just above the surface of the particle.</p> <p>So the excited electron splits the oxygen in half and \u2013 because oxygen molecules are two oxygen atoms \u2013 then you have an oxygen atom that's alone and oxygen atoms react with something immediately. That's generally water and that makes peroxide, aka bleach, which bleaches the nitrogen oxides that are polluting the atmosphere.</p> <p><strong>Bleach? Isn't that a skin irritant?</strong></p> <p>No. We've been wearing clothes treated with Catclo for two years with no ill-effects and tests back this up.</p> <p><strong>Why clothing? Why not some other external surface like house bricks?</strong></p> <p>It's a question of surface area. The surface area of a house is pretty small because the bricks are flat. Whereas the surface area of clothing is the surface area of the fibres and the fibres are very small. So if you unwrap all the surface of the fibres it's much bigger than the area of the fabric.</p> <p><strong>Does it only work on the outer layers? </strong></p> <p>Light gets all the way through most clothes because most clothing is quite see-through. If you had a pair of curtains the same thickness as your trousers they wouldn't be very good. Curtains are actually quite deep; there's a lot of material because you need a lot of material to absorb all the light.</p> <p><strong>How much nitrogen oxide can treated garments absorb?</strong></p> <p>At a typical London street concentration of nitric oxide, which is 40\u00b5g per m<sup>3</sup>, coated denim will take out 80% of the pollution at the kind of flow rate you get from someone walking.</p> <p><strong>But what if I'm indoors or sitting still?</strong></p> <p>If you are sitting still outside there will be air movements. If you are inside under fluorescent lights then there is still sufficient light to make the catalyst work. There is always a temperature difference between you and the room and that causes convection, because every person is like a little radiator. You are a walking 100 watt radiator and you yourself cause convection: you heat the air, that hot air rises and that air gets replenished with fresh air. So if you are catalytic \u2013 if your clothes have been catalysed \u2013 the air that comes off you is clean and it will get replenished with dirty air because of the temperature difference between you and the room.</p> <p><strong>Will it damage my clothes?</strong></p> <p>It does, but all of these reactions are below microscopic level.</p> <p><strong>How is the additive applied? Do you have to add it to every wash or can it be built into clothing from the start?</strong></p> <p>There are ways of binding the additive to fabric so it is there permanently or you can wash it in. If you wash it in, it could last 10 or 20 washes; if it is put in professionally by clothes manufacturers it could last for ever.</p> <p><strong>How soon will it be available?</strong></p> <p>We are talking to all sorts of people about how we might apply this. But the key thing is that for this to work everyone needs to do it. So that's why we'd prefer the laundry route because everyone washes their clothes. We are talking to all the big detergent manufacturers and it looks like Ecover will get to market first.</p> <p>Because we are so keen to get this out there is no patent. If this technology was owned by a single brand it would only hit a small proportion of the population and there would be no discernible difference.</p> <p>It would mean people buying new clothes and the environmental impact of that would be very bad. The thing about doing laundry is that you are retrofitting existing clothes. So I'm really sold on doing it by laundry.</p> <p>For example, to get Sheffield below the air-quality threshold we need about a quarter of a million people to be catalysed at any one time \u2013 about half the population. So if it was only people in Levis then you wouldn't have enough people. But because there are more pairs of jeans in the UK than there are people, if half the people had washed their jeans in this stuff then we'd be there. It works particularly well with denim.</p> <p><strong>Who's the most famous owner of a pair of jeans you have catalysed?</strong></p> <p>We had a request to catalyse universities minister David Willetts's jeans via the Manchester science festival. If David Cameron or the minister for environment want to courier me their jeans I'd be more than happy to catalyse them.</p> <p><em>Catalytic Clothing will be running a pop-up laundry at </em><a href=\"http://www.manchestersciencefestival.com/whatson/fieldofjeans\" title=\"\"><em>Manchester science festival, </em></a><em> 27 October to 4 November </em></p>",
  "<p>In the late 1980s, Marcia Herman-Giddens was working in a paediatric clinic at Duke University Medical Centre in North Carolina when she noticed a puzzling phenomenon. More and more girls aged eight or nine who visited the clinic had started to sprout pubic hair and breasts. At the time, medical orthodoxy held that the average age of puberty for girls in the west was over 11. The numbers of under-10s that Herman-Giddens was seeing did not fit with this scenario. She began collecting data that eventually produced a study with the American Academy of Pediatrics that studied 17,000 girls and found that the average age of breast-budding among white girls was 9.9 years while for black girls it was 8.8.</p> <p>The discovery was hugely controversial. Many doctors refused to accept the fact that more and more girls had begun to mature sexually before they had reached the age of 10. \"The Lolita syndrome [the prurient fascination with the sexuality of young girls] created a lot of emotional interest,\" recalls Herman-Giddens, now at the University of North Carolina. \"As a feminist, I wish it didn't.\"</p> <p>Today most doctors accept that the age of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/world/2012/oct/20/us-study-boys-puberty-earlier\" title=\"\">onset of puberty</a> is dropping steadily. Many studies have showed this to be the case for girls, and new research carried out by Herman-Giddens, and published by the American Academy of Pediatrics, has found the same for boys. The age of onset of biological adulthood continues to plunge. Consider the statistics provided by German researchers. They found that in 1860, the average age of the onset of puberty in girls was 16.6 years. In 1920, it was 14.6; in 1950, 13.1; 1980, 12.5; and in 2010, it had dropped to 10.5. Similar sets of figures have been reported for boys, albeit with a delay of around a year.</p> <p>What factors lie behind this trend? Why are our children reaching biological adulthood at earlier and earlier ages? And what are the medical implications of this? Answers to these questions are still debated, although most scientists and health experts believe that the initial decline in the age in puberty was linked to general improvements in health in the west that began in the late 19th century. The trouble is that this drop, which was expected to stop, has simply continued at the same rate: a decline in four to five months in age of onset for each passing decade.</p> <p>This relentless slide has begun to worry doctors who have proposed a host of causes to explain it. Increasing obesity is often quoted. In the young it is thought to increase blood levels of oestrogens that promote breast development and early studies seemed to confirm this by linking puberty to higher body mass index. However, a Danish study released last year in the journal <em>Paediatrics</em> found puberty occurring earlier in children regardless of body mass index at age seven.</p> <p>Other factors that may be involved include a diet that is increasingly high in sugar and fat and declining physical activity. The cause could also be environmental, say other researchers \u2013 in particular, exposure to endocrine disrupters, chemicals in the environment that act on hormones.</p> <p>Widespread industrial and pharmaceutical pollutants have already been shown to harm the normal sexual development of fish and animals. By extension, they may also contribute to earlier or disrupted puberty in children, these scientists contend.</p> <p>As to the likelihood that precocious puberty poses perils for young people, this is still debated \u2013 though many parents worry that early sexual development puts strain on children who are being robbed of years of innocent childhood.</p>",
  "<p>Nearly a million overseas visitors travelled to Britain last year to watch football matches, according to research confirming the popularity of the UK as a leading sports tourism destination. Despite the high price of tickets and the problems of violence and racism in the game, new figures from the national tourism agency reaffirm the global allure of British football, particularly the Premier League.</p> <p>Figures compiled by VisitBritain show that 900,000 football supporters visited Britain last year, a figure tourism bosses hope will be further supplemented by the sporting success of the Olympics.</p> <p>Hugh Robertson, the minister for sport and tourism, described the Premier League as \"one of this country's most successful exports\". He said: \"It is no surprise that it has become a big draw for tourists who want to experience the most exciting league in the world.\"</p> <p>Football tourists collectively spent \u00a3706m, or \u00a3785 per fan \u2013 \u00a3200 more than the average visitor to Britain \u2013 with many arriving during the traditionally quieter period for tourism between January and March.</p> <p>The allure of British football is most keenly pronounced in Norway, with one in 13 visitors from the country \u2013 80,000 \u2013 watching a match. Other countries generating high numbers of football spectator visits include Ireland (174,000), the US (61,000), Spain (54,000) and Germany (48,000).</p> <p>Four in ten of those who attended a match said watching sport was their principal reason for visiting the UK. Football was also found to encourage visitors to explore beyond London, with the stadiums attracting the largest number of overseas fans in the north-west.</p> <p>Almost one in five watched a game at Manchester United's Old Trafford ground, followed closely by Anfield, home of Liverpool.</p> <p>In terms of armchair support, the Premier League is already established as the biggest continuous annual global sporting event on television in the world, with matches viewed in 212 countries and coverage available in some 720m households.</p> <p>Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, said: \"It is now the most watched and supported football league in the world and there's a huge amount of effort being made to connect with our 900 million international fans. Our clubs have worked very hard to make Premier League grounds more welcoming and are striving to deliver a first-rate experience for all fans.</p> <p>\"Little, though, beats the thrill of a Premier League match day and it's very encouraging to hear that football can play an important role in increasing the numbers of international visitors to this country.\"</p> <p>The research also found that around 1.3 million tourists travelled to Britain for a live sporting event last year, four per cent of all visits, with the estimated total spend calculated as \u00a31.1bn.</p> <p>The greatest number of spectators for golf came from the US, rugby was popular with the Irish and French, while cricket attracted the most visitors from Australia.</p>",
  "<p>Why is Britain not better insulated against volatile energy prices? It's an issue much bigger than how we heat our homes. More than a decade ago, rising fuel prices triggered protests by truck drivers that revealed the fragile nature of the nation's infrastructure. The government and the protesters seemed equally stunned at the swiftness with which a blockade of a handful of fuel depots could interrupt so many vital supply lines and services.</p> <p>In an atmosphere of near panic, Whitehall met supermarket bosses who were warning that their shops had just three days' worth of food on the shelves. In 2008, there was a triple whammy of the banking crisis, rocketing oil costs and food prices driven both by the price of oil and crop failures due to extreme weather. It can't be exaggerated how much the fate of transport, farming, households and industry is sewn into the fabric of the energy system. It carries a kind of DNA for our livelihoods. Everything relies on energy and changes in the industry have impacts that work through the wider economy in complex and interwoven ways. Now the fabric of the system has worn thin and could be ripped apart by the economic and environmental pressures pulling on it.</p> <p>Faced with this picture, end-of-pipe policy reforms, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cameron-energy-department-explain-tariff\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a>'s voter-friendly but ill-prepared pledge to force the big utilities to offer customers their cheapest deal, are entirely inadequate. They are no substitute for grabbing the overdue economic opportunity of investing in a modern, resilient, low-carbon energy system.</p> <p>The big picture is important. Debate could easily get bogged down in technology versus technology point scoring. And it easy to pick off those who overclaim for certain technologies That would simply continue the locked-in mess we already have. But if we ask questions such as how many jobs can be created, how much carbon can you cut and how much energy do you get back for the amount of energy invested, a mix of renewable technologies will be first in queue</p> <p>Since 2008, two different governments have had the chance to create countless jobs, build a better energy system, ensure Britain has warmer homes in winter and tackle climate change by investing at scale in a \"green new deal\".</p> <p>It is still the case that a tiny fraction of the public resources used to underpin the banking system could revolutionise energy generation and radically reduce consumption and dependence through energy efficiency measures in the nation's building stock. Why not, for example, inject productive capital in a targeted way into the real economy through green bonds via the Green Investment Bank?</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\" title=\"\">IMF</a> noted that the negative, \"reverse leverage\" of spending cuts was worse than it thought. To no one's surprise, George Osborne's faith in the exotic economic notion of \"expansionary fiscal contraction\" didn't work. At the same time, in response to voices from business, the government acknowledges that some kind of industrial policy is now necessary to get the nation back to work and energy is key to this.</p> <p>Yet, in spite of high prices and climate change targets, there is still a sense in which energy policy is stuck in the mindset that characterised transport policy back in the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 one of predict and provide, rather than simply pushing the utilities to offer lower prices.</p> <p>It is oddly appropriate that the banking sector's former chief lobbyist, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/02/angela-knight-british-bankers-association\" title=\"\">Angela Knight</a>, who represented the British Bankers' Association, is now the voice of the big energy companies at Energy UK. For complacency on energy policy today ranks with the overconfident thinking in 2006 on banking and finance. While all energy issues matter, it is still the case that the greatest overall threat comes from our dependence on oil \u2013 high and volatile in price, environmentally destabilising in use and explosive in terms of geopolitics.</p> <p>George Osborne gives the oil companies tax breaks and self-serving reports from within the industry tell us that oil is entering a new golden age, exploiting its newer \"unconventional\" sources such as Alaskan shale oil. Such a case was made recently in a report funded by the oil company BP, written by a former oil company executive Leonardo Maugeri and published by the Harvard Kennedy School. Nothing could be more wrong and ranks in terms of complacency with Gordon Brown's 2006 Mansion House speech boast on the success of the UK's \"light touch\" financial regulation.</p> <p>A recent and methodologically more complete analysis than Maugeri's by the IMF on the future of oil notes that diminishing increases in production can only be bought at a likely doubling of the price of oil over the next decade. This is likely to usher in the phenomenon of what might be called economic peak oil \u2013 \"a pain barrier\" beyond which the level of oil prices has a dramatic effect. The IMF calls it a \"shock\" that will have \"large and persistent\" macro-economic effects.</p> <p>Then there is the climate question. The UK and the EU are committed to a course of action that will prevent temperatures rising by more than 2\u00b0C. And the latest science tells us that to meet that we can only afford to burn around one-fifth of the available, and economically recoverable, fossil fuel reserves between today and 2050.</p> <p>There must be a strong sense of deja-vu in households bewildered by how their energy costs float up against a backdrop of rising international fuel prices but don't seem to float down when they reduce. Several factors explain why. The market is over-concentrated, with too few, too large self-interested energy companies that regulators either cannot or won't regulate in the public interest. Second, it is precisely because Britain has failed aggressively to diversify its energy supply, so that it remains highly vulnerable to changes in the prices of fossil fuels. Equally, the economic opportunity to invest at scale in energy efficiency and the insulation of Britain's old, draughty building stock would more than pay for itself bringing jobs, lower fuel bills, warmer homes in winter and boost the overall economy.</p> <p>As it is, we suffer an uncompetitive market, with too little diversity of supply and a clean, renewables sector crying out for the investment conditions to expand, which is further hampered by a government too hidebound by economic doctrine to see the one policy \u2013 a green new deal \u2013 that could solve all these problems. So here is that rare political thing \u2013 a win-win situation. It's the sort of thing that great legacies are made of. With so many other problems around, wouldn't any politician want to grab it with both hands?</p>",
  "<p>A last-minute legal challenge has dealt a fresh blow to the government's increasingly troubled cull of badgers in England, the <em>Observer</em> has learned.</p> <p>The Badger Trust's lawyers have served <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2012/oct/22/badger-trust-letter-halt-cull\">a 16-page legal letter</a> on Natural England, the government agency licensing the culling, which could halt the cull. \"The costs of the cull are soaring out of control, with little benefit in sight for farmers and major risks posed for members of the public in the cull areas,\" said Gwendolen Morgan, the trust's solicitor at Bindmans LLP. \"It is time for the government to reconsider.\"</p> <p>The delayed cull now appears at serious risk of being abandoned, for this year at least. On Thursday it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that the number of badgers in the cull areas <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cost-badger-cull-u-turn\">was up to twice initial estimates</a>, presenting a much greater challenge to farmers already said to be deeply concerned by rising costs and complications.</p> <p>Environment secretary Owen Paterson and farming minister David Heath added to the confusion by cancelling a series of media interviews. Whitehall sources compared the chaotic situation to <em>The Thick of It</em>. One said: \"Paterson and No 10 have had to persuade the National Farmers' Union to continue with the cull to avoid another U-turn.\"</p> <p>Ministers argue that the badger cull is an essential part of efforts to curb rising tuberculosis infections in cattle, which saw 26,000 cattle slaughtered in 2011 at a cost to taxpayers of \u00a390m.</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the National Farmers' Union both insisted yesterday that the badger cull would proceed as soon as possible.</p> <p>On Friday, NFU president Peter Kendall <a href=\"http://www.farmersguardian.com/nfu-committed-to-badger-cull-despite-badger-number-concerns/50655.article\" title=\"\">acknowledged</a> the difficulties facing the cull: \"We are working bloody hard to make sure this is deliverable. The latest numbers are making this more challenging.\"</p> <p>The new legal letter is an \"urgent pre-action protocol letter\", which gives NE a final chance to address the trust's concerns before the latter seeks a judicial review \u2013 and an injunction, if needed \u2014 to halt the cull. The letter has effectively put a temporary stop on the cull.</p> <p>\"We have now had information which reveals a number of serious flaws in the licensing process,\" writes Morgan. \"We have advised our clients that the licences granted are unlawful.\"</p> <p>The Trust argues that the public's legal right to safety is put at risk by the fact that no barriers or warnings will be posted around the cull areas, meaning people using publicly accessible land could walk into the shooting area.</p> <p>A Natural England spokesman for said: \"We are considering the letter and will respond in due course.\"He confirmed the final licence conditions had yet to be met by the cullers but could be fulfilled at any time, meaning badgers could begin to be killed immediately.As winter approaches, time is fast running out for the cull to begin because badgers lie low in their setts in the cold weather. Farmers must kill at least 70% of all the badgers over six weeks because otherwise escaping badgers spread TB further and increase infections.</p> <p>Previous legal action by the Badger Trust halted a planned cull in Wales.</p> <p>The Trust also argues that the spiralling costs of the cull mean NE has a duty to carry out a new cost impact assessment.</p> <p>On Friday, it was <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121018/text/121018w0001.htm#12101855001267\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that the government had to spend \u00a3850,000 surveying badger numbers after the data supplied by landowners was found to be inadequate. The government's initial assessment already showed that the cull will cost more than it saves. The Trust is also concerned that the method of killing the badgers allowed in the policy is being changed.</p> <p>The cull was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">described</a> as \"mindless\" by one of the 32 eminent scientists who wrote to the Observer last week, demanding its cancellation. The issue has driven the largest animal rights protest since fox hunting was banned in 2004.</p> <p>More than 150,000 people signed a Downing Street website petition and won a six-hour parliamentary debate next Thursday, the first such in the Commons. The government will have to vote down a motion to halt the cull.</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne will receive a boost this week from official figures confirming that the Olympics effect helped to bounce Britain out of recession in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>City analysts believe the economy expanded between July and September, after shrinking for the previous three quarters in the longest double-dip recession since the second world war.</p> <p>That would mark the official end of the recession, and allow the chancellor to present a relatively upbeat picture of the economy in his autumn statement on 5 December, following news that unemployment has started to decline.</p> <p>The respected National Institute of Economic and Social Research has forecast a healthy third-quarter growth rate of 0.8%, and Osborne is likely to seize on the upturn as evidence that his policies are starting to bear fruit.</p> <p>However, economists are already warning that the comeback will be short-lived, with growth in the third quarter artificially inflated by temporary factors including Olympics spending and the recovery from the extra jubilee bank holiday in June. The Office for National Statistics has decided that all spending on Olympics tickets will be \"scored\" in third-quarter GDP, whenever the payments were actually made.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"This one-off boost from the Olympics is not a long-term strategy and it should not breed yet more complacency from ministers, however big it is. Even growth of 1% would simply mean the economy is the same size as a year ago. The big questions are what is the underlying level of growth in our economy, what growth can be generated in future quarters, and whether and how we can catch up all the ground we have lost over the last two years.\"</p> <p>Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said: \"We believe that the economy has exited recession and is now eking out very limited underlying growth helped by reduced inflation, rising employment and an edging up of earnings growth from early-2012 lows boosting consumers' capacity to spend.\"</p> <p>Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citi, warned that even once the recession was over, the economy could face several more years of weakness. \"We've got all of these headwinds. It's everything: austerity; the euro crisis; the health of the banks; household debt \u2013 all of them.\"</p> <p>He added that living standards \u2013 measured as real GDP per head \u2013 had still not recovered to pre-recession levels, reversing a long-term rising trend. \"We're below the peak, and I don't think we'll get back to where we were for at least five years.\"</p> <p>Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"This doesn't feel like a recovery to the millions of workers whose wages have now been falling in real terms for several years and who can't get enough hours to make ends meet. And it certainly doesn't feel like a recovery to the 2.5 million people out of work, a third of whom haven't had a job for over a year.\"</p> <p>Despite the expected upturn in the second half of 2012, the economy remains far weaker than most analysts anticipated at the start of the year.</p> <p>In its budget forecast in March, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted 0.8% growth for the whole of 2012 \u2013 already a sickly pace, but considerably stronger than the 0.4% contraction now expected by the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee is widely expected to expand its unprecedented \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme next month, unless the economy shows clear signs of a stronger recovery.</p>",

This aligns with the view expressed last year by a specially convened meeting of scientific experts to discuss the issue, including several of the scientists who signed the open letter criticising the government's policy.</p> <p>In these circumstances, the government has decided to introduce a policy of culling designed to maximise the reduction of TB in cattle.

The head-to-head oppositional nature of party politics is not how people live their lives; for most people, politicians' antics are alienating; achieving in life, success, is achieved by co-operation and compromise.</p> <p>What this society needs, and what it won't get from our dumbed-down politicians and media, is a broad reform of our political system that will take it out of the 19th century and into the 21st.</p> <p><strong>Paul J Burrows</strong></p> <p>Nottingham</p> <h2><strong>Pip, pip\u2026</strong></h2> <p>\"Orange, a word that has no rhyme\" you say (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/13/orange-prize-wfp-books\" title=\"\">How charm, luck and guile saved the prize that used to be Orange\"</a>, News) and this is a popular misconception, as one of my poems shows:</p> <p>Near Monmouth, while climbing the hill of Blorenge</p> <p>with no more than mintcake and a bottle of orange,</p> <p>I found a parsley fern.

  "<p>A quarter of a century ago, when briefing Paul Williams and Alan Stanton on the shop he wanted them to design in London, the fashion designer Issey Miyake gave them, by way of a brief, one of his jackets. According to Williams, \"he asked us to feel it, the material, the way it was made\". Miyake wanted the shop to have the same qualities: \"He was asking us to think about the senses.\"</p> <p>\"We learned a lot from him,\" Williams continues. \"Touch and sense are fundamental. They are the ways in which architecture engages with people.\" Stanton and Williams's projects have got bigger since the 1980s, but they say they're still pursuing the same qualities. Their design of the <a href=\"http://www.slcu.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Sainsbury Laboratory in Cambridge</a> \u2013 which last week won this year's Stirling prize \u2013 is, among other things, about the effects of the stone, timber&#xa0;and concrete of which it is made, and the way in which it responds to the \"path of the sun\" and the \"colour of the light\".</p> <p>Before they joined forces, Stanton and Williams were going in opposite directions. Stanton worked with Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano on the <a href=\"http://arts.theguardian.com/greatbuildings/pompidou/0,,2183688,00.html\" title=\"\">Pompidou Centre</a> in Paris, the greatest cultural construction of its time. Williams established himself as a designer of temporary exhibitions in museums and galleries all over the world. One worked with the large, permanent infrastructure of art, the other with the internal and temporary.</p> <p>Together, their first opportunities were with shop design, as was common in the 1980s \u2013 \"frock shops\", as David Chipperfield, who rose by a similar route, used to call them. Also with exhibition installations, another form of interior for looking at things. They won competitions for actual physical buildings, extensions to the RIBA's headquarters and the National Portrait Gallery, but neither was built. They started gaining a reputation and were asked to lecture and exhibit, but they felt a little uneasy \u2013 \"We felt we should have built something.\"</p> <p>The buildings came, starting with a studio for the artist Val Archer and an office block part-formed out of the terracotta shell of an old Harrods warehouse, for the developer Crispin Kelly. But Stanton and Williams say that their experience of working with interiors (and they still design such things as the installation of the Royal Academy's current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/sep/23/bronze-royal-academy-review\" title=\"\">Bronze exhibition</a>) shapes all their work. They design \"from the inside out\". They start with the qualities of space, with the senses, with light and \"the way people operate and move\".</p> <p>A wall, they say, is not an end in itself but \"only a way of capturing space\". If their buildings have a consistent look \u2013 usually rectangular, straight lined, with plain surfaces and simple rhythms \u2013 that's because these exterior means allow them to achieve their interior ends. Their \"calm and neutral\" style lets the qualities of space that interest them become more apparent.</p> <p>They are keen to show me designs for a residential development on the Thames that has curves, which is about \"embracing the space around the river\", but stress that it's achieved by the same \"rigour and discipline\" they bring to all their projects. It is not \"spurious form-making\". \"We have never dropped architecture from the sky,\" says Stanton. \"It always comes from the site, the context and the brief.\" These things \"give creative energy\".</p> <p>The Sainsbury Laboratory is a centre for high-level research into plant science in the botanic garden in Cambridge. As well as laboratories, it contains spaces for writing research, a lecture theatre and a herbarium for storing specimens, including some collected by Charles Darwin. The laboratory block is L-shaped, half enclosing a cloister-like court, which is closed on the other sides by impressive mature trees and by a cafe for the garden-going public.</p> <p>The laboratory is \"built around interaction\", with a broad stair, galleries, niches and other communal spaces designed to help scientists discuss and share their ideas. It is also based on the Darwin's fondness for <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesthetic_learning\" title=\"\">kinaesthetic thinking</a> \u2013 of developing ideas through moving and walking \u2013 and so has loops of circulation inside the building and routes into the surrounding gardens.</p> <p>Its materials are a yellowish limestone, timber and concrete, more than the steel or aluminium you might&#xa0;expect of a modern laboratory. This is because \"it is built for the long term, for a very a serious research endeavour\", because it seeks to impart&#xa0;\"dignity\" and because its aims include raising the profile of the <a href=\"http://www.botanic.cam.ac.uk/Botanic/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">botanic garden</a> as a whole. This does not mean,&#xa0;the architects are anxious to &#xa0;stress, that the building is inflexible&#xa0;\u2013 it's \"a framework in which things can happen\".</p> <p>All this looks expensive, and the budget of \u00a382m sounds expensive, which prompted <a href=\"http://simonpzwallis.com/2012/10/14/thoughts-on-riba-stirling-prize-2012-the-hepworth-wakefield/\" title=\"\">an outburst from Simon Wallis, the director</a> of the Hepworth Wakefield gallery, which was shortlisted for the Stirling prize. The winner, he said, had \"an enormous budget in an extremely privileged city\". Unsurprisingly, Stanton Williams want to stress that, once costs for such things as specialist equipment are taken out, the price of the building was \"within the benchmarks\" for research laboratories.</p> <p>They also direct my attention to their rusty steel <a href=\"http://www.stantonwilliams.com/projects/hackney-marshes-centre/\" title=\"\">Hackney sports centre</a>, a much cheaper building in the very different environment of Hackney Marshes. Here they were asked to design something vandal-proof, but they are proud that, after a year of use, \"it has suffered no abuse, internally or externally, not one bit of damage\". Good design, Stanton insists, does not require extravagant spending. What it does need \"is the time to do it. You do need time.\"</p> <p>Alan Stanton and Paul Williams exude calm and reasonableness. They talk quietly and slowly. They complement each other, without the rivalrous edge that longstanding architectural partnerships, like old married couples, sometimes develop. They give prominence to other members of their team, such as <a href=\"http://www.stantonwilliams.com/team/people/gavin-henderson/\" title=\"\">Gavin Henderson</a>, the director in charge of the Sainsbury Laboratory.</p> <p>They tell me that, after due consideration of the laboratory brief, they decided that \"we were not looking for a project that was shouting\". Do you ever decide that a building does need to shout? I ask. They reflect that no, apart from the <a href=\"http://www.stantonwilliams.com/projects/belgrade-theatre/\" title=\"\">Belgrade theatre in Coventry</a>, which has flashes of red in its grey cuboid exterior, they have never felt the need to make too much noise. \"There would have to be a bloody good reason. Hasn't the problem with recent architecture been too many buildings trying to shout?\"</p> <p>To call them serious, cautious, thoughtful, painstaking or craftsmanly could be a form of faint praise. It could imply insipid, pedestrian or unimaginative. Certainly, the <a href=\"http://www.lyrictheatre.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lyric theatre in Belfast</a>, also shortlisted for the Stirling, has more romantic oomph, and the Hepworth has a cussed, rock-like physicality. There is something, hard to define, that sometimes seems to be not quite there in Stanton Williams's work \u2013 a slight disengagement, perhaps; an abstraction, a preference for staying in the sphere where they can best work in their reflective way.</p> <p>But it requires an unreasonable level of critical fussiness to make too much of this possible lack, and touring the Sainsbury Laboratory it is hard to wish it different. Their priorities, of basing the building on the ways it is inhabited and its sensory and spatial properties, are absolutely right. There is also something deeply impressive \u2013 a kind of heroism \u2013 in the persistence with which Stanton and Williams pursue their way of designing and building and it shows in their work. Insipid or pedestrian it is not.</p>",
  "<p>The video clip on YouTube already has the feel of a history lesson. It has taken on the atmosphere of a fateful moment, a before and after, like the signing of the Yalta treaty, or a Moonie wedding. The moment of the launch of Facebook as a $100bn public company seemed to show the myth of the American Dream in real time, visual proof that something \u2013 potentially the world's most valuable entity \u2013 had been made out of nothing, a simple idea in the head of a Harvard undergraduate. Half a year on, it looks as much an ending as a beginning.</p> <p>You can see a lot of that story in the film clip, on faces gathered outside Facebook's headquarters at Hacker Square in Menlo Park, California, on 18 May 2012. Our digital age has acclimatised us to extreme numbers, the winner-takes-all lottery of wealth distribution, but rarely have we seen such a group of people instantaneously enriched beyond their imagination. The colleagues look like they have turned up on this bright spring morning to man the stalls at a high-school fete, or for a charity walk, in hoodies and T-shirts and fleeces and jeans. One second they can count their wealth in five or six zeroes, the next in eight or nine or 10. As the clip rolls and Mark Zuckerberg signs his name on a transparent Nasdaq screen, signalling that Facebook is open for trading, an&#xa0;excitement passes through the crowd. On the TechCrunch website there is a ticker running, a reckoning of instant plutocracy: \"Ted Ullyot, general counsel, $234,181,060. Mike Schroepfer, VP of engineering, $340,141,012. Mark Zuckerberg, $20,305,226,592\u2026\" How do the&#xa0;people attached to these numbers look? They look happy, fit to burst.</p> <p>That happiness, at that moment, extended far beyond Hacker Square. It extended to all the investors large and small who believed. Zuckerberg, 28, had long demanded faith in Facebook. And all his believers knew the story \u2013 they had all seen the movie, and most importantly they felt the insistent pulse the social network had generated in their own lives. On the clip after Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, presents Zuckerberg, \"your visionary, your leader\", with a commemorative hoodie, the world's favourite boy wonder, makes a little speech reaffirming that faith. \"Here's the thing,\" he says in his slightly disconnected way, \"our mission isn't to be a public company. Our mission is to make the world more open and connected\u2026 All of you out there have built the largest community in the world.\" Not surprisingly, as he speaks his colleagues have the moon-faced look of disciples at the Sermon on the Mount captured in medieval stained glass. They have been through a lot together; some, those crowded most closely around Zuckerberg, have been believers in his miracles from the start. Their rewards have come sooner than heaven.</p> <p>All of the night before, news networks have accessed all areas on the Facebook campus to capture the atmosphere before the big sell-off. The Facebook workers, or hackers, as they prefer, have duly performed like children on Christmas Eve. They have given up on sleep and engaged in the ultimate \"hackathon\", playing roller hockey in the square, watching movies, camping out on sofas and doing bits of programming for the site, ordering in Chinese and pizza, recreating once again the essential exportable spirit of their organisation: faces illuminated into the early hours by laptop screens, buzzing on energy drinks, silently instant messaging across the room, making the world ever more connected before our very eyes.</p> <p>They have not been thinking about performance cars and stupidly early retirement; they have been thinking, as ever, about enhanced user experiences and ever-cooler interfaces. Still, they are aware that for days and weeks the valuation of their company has been the subject of mass speculation. The wisdom of a Silicon Valley crowdsourced poll has produced an aggregate of the expected value of Facebook come the end of the first day of trading. The figure that has been collectively arrived at is $135.1bn\u2013 a single-day rise that represents more than a gain of one-third of the opening offer price of $38 per share. The investment bankers handling the offering, Morgan Stanley, have surely been conservative in their thinking, the crowdsourced feeling goes; they wouldn't want to risk their credibility on an inflated valuation.</p> <p>There is much talk of a \"pop\" on the news networks: \"Do you think we will see a pop?\" \"How big a pop do you think there will be?\" The pop in question refers to the explosive growth as the stock hits the market, like a kernel of corn reacting to a hot pan. For those few cynics among the faithful \u2013 who perhaps have a working knowledge of Charles Mackay's 1841 volume <em>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</em>, or who at least had, as they like to say, \"drilled down into the figures\" and placed their bets accordingly \u2013 that pop was also, you guess, the sound of bubbles bursting.</p> <p>Nearly six months on, those doubters with their sober analysis or contrarian instincts, who gambled against Facebook stock from the beginning, have been counting their winnings. Daniel Niles, who runs the AlphaOne Capital Partners, made millions of dollars for his investors by \"shorting\" Facebook the moment it opened for trading at $42 a share. Shorting involves borrowing quantities of shares and selling them at the high price, waiting for the price to fall, then buying other cheaper shares to return to the lender and pocketing the difference. Niles explained his analysis as follows: \"If you looked at Facebook, the good news was you had a very public comparable company with a lot of the same issues and good things going on, which is Google. To some extent, it was like two houses on the same block\u2026 But you look at Google, and investors were valuing it at roughly six times annual revenues; and you look at Facebook, and despite it growing [only] twice as fast as Google, they valued it at about 24 times revenue\u2026 To me, this looked like a recipe for disaster, and that's why we shorted at the open.\" Another such investor, representing a major fund, described his decision with slightly less mathematical nuance: \"My mother asked me to get Facebook shares and she has never been interested in IPOs [initial public offerings] before. A cab driver asked me about the IPO, too. That's when you want to short it.\"</p> <p>On the first day of trading, markets reported that the share price had been propped up by Morgan Stanley, the bank that had acted as the lead underwriter in the sale on Facebook's behalf. What had looked like a&#xa0;major coup for the bank's Silicon Valley investment chief Michael Grimes quickly became a headache. In an attempt to defend the $38 opening price some observers suggested the bank may have spent a billion dollars buying back stock, though Morgan Stanley will not comment on the issue.</p> <p>A few even among the closest circle of Facebook believers were perhaps not quite as faithful as they at first seemed. Peter Thiel, the canny founder of PayPal, who had invested $500,000 in Facebook in 2004, cashed in a&#xa0;thousand times that on the first day of trading. On the right side of things, as ever, Goldman Sachs, which had bought a $500m share in the company last November, sold about another billion dollars straightaway, as did Zuckerberg, in what turned out to be nice wedding gift to himself when he tied the knot with his long-term girlfriend Priscilla Chan in a surprise ceremony the day after flotation.</p> <p>Even by the time Zuckerberg and Chan were on honeymoon in Rome a postmortem on the IPO and share price, which had by then fallen almost $10, was underway. It was already being talked of as the most disastrous IPO in history; and the first lawsuits had been filed. Facebook spokespeople united with Morgan Stanley in suggesting that technical glitches on the Nasdaq system, which delayed the start of trading by 45 minutes and saw investors struggle to get confirmation of trades, had damaged confidence. Major fund managers laid the blame with the decision, in the week before the IPO, to increase the number of shares being sold by 25% and to raise the asking price from a range between $28 and $35 to one between $34 and $38. A $100bn valuation had a convenient headline ring to it.</p> <p>At the same time a hardening rumour persisted that those closest to the deal were party to more information than regular small-time investors. By 23 May, shareholders had filed five lawsuits against Facebook in New York and California. That number quickly swelled to around 40. On 1&#xa0;June, three small Facebook shareholders \u2013 David Goldberg, Kevin Hyms and Garrett Garrison, who had invested retirement funds and lifetime savings \u2013 filed a class action suit against Zuckerberg and his company. Court records detailing their case argue that Facebook had been less than forthcoming about the fact that in the weeks leading up to flotation there had been a downgraded forecast of revenue, which had caused some analysts, even those at Morgan Stanley, to revise down confidence in the company \u2013 information only allegedly shared with major investors. Facebook and its underwriters strongly refute these allegations. The case, which will be heard on behalf of perhaps thousands of IPO believers, mums and taxi drivers among them, will also draw on evidence from the Securities and Exchange Commission about Facebook's apparent reluctance to release some key data \u2013 notably the way it counted mobile users, and the revenue it generated from them \u2013 even when pressed to do so. Facebook will argue that it displayed no such equivocation and that such exchanges were a&#xa0;normal part of such a process.</p> <p>Andrew Goldenberg, one of the attorneys representing Goldberg, Hyms and Garrison, described how the three men came to his office \"confused and frustrated and angry\u2026 They are not sophisticated investors,\" he said. \"They thought they were buying into a company that had a promising future.\" Nearly 200 others followed that trio and are now part of the claim. \"They all tell the same story,\" Goldenberg said. \"They feel cheated. You are talking about an unprecedented loss after five months for this kind of high-profile IPO. Hype drove it, and that is fine. But you can't do that on the basis of incomplete information. They feel it is another example of the citizen being taken advantage of by these banks and big corporations.\"</p> <p>Where money has been lost on such a scale, conspiracies abound, but two key reasons for the freefall of the stock price, which quickly lost half of its value, seem to have existed in plain sight. The first was the timing of an announcement by General Motors, which the day before the IPO made the decision to pull all advertising from Facebook, suggesting that, having looked hard at its numbers, it had no clear evidence that advertising on the site was effective. The second, perhaps more fundamental, explanation for the market's pessimism lay in the rhetoric of Mark Zuckerberg.</p> <p>Zuckerberg had never been convinced he should take his company public, though regulatory changes made it inevitable. He worried about shareholders who wanted Facebook's first thought to be its bottom line rather than its product. And he feared a loss of control. To this end, he had created two classes of shares, which guaranteed that he would have 57% voting control of Facebook with only a 28% financial stake. His anxieties were realised almost immediately.</p> <p>Zuckerberg was used to updating users of his site, but not so practised at reassuring investors. Before the IPO he affirmed what he repeated at the moment of the sale: that he did not see himself primarily as a man in charge of a multibillion-dollar business but rather as a man on a mission to teach the world to poke in perfect harmony. Fundholders are not traditionally seduced by missionaries.</p> <p>Over the summer Zuckerberg was strangely silent, as if adjusting to his new realities: married life and problems at the office. He had perhaps the first premonitions of what all prodigies discover: that he, too, would have to grow up. In his first call with major investors at the end of July, he pursued a line about the Facebook model that \"the best type of advertising is a message from a friend\". This had sounded reasonable enough when he had uttered it to interviewers and journalists over the years, and it seemed to chime with popular psychology about tipping points \u2013 but was it really true? And if so, where did it leave companies like General Motors, which were spending a small fortune on creating consistent messages about their products that were measurable in terms of sales?</p> <p>Over the few years since its inception, Facebook had been somewhat cavalier about its revenue strategies, making the seductive argument that once it had a critical mass of users, money would surely follow. Google had solved the intractable problem of how to monetise its audience by having advertisers bid for keywords, selling sponsored links and charging for each time a user clicked on them. Facebook's advertising model was always more intangible, based largely on precisely targeted display adverts and the vaunted \"engagement\" of the user, who typically spends an hour a day on the site. In a widely quoted figure, Google made $88 from each of its users, Facebook only $15. Moreover, Google's model worked potentially equally well on mobile formats as on desktops. Facebook had been slow to see the shift to mobile, and that apparent anxiety over releasing user data which angered the likes of Hyms, Goldberg and Garrison suggested they were still troubled by the problem of how to make effective use of display advertising on a&#xa0;screen no bigger than a playing card.</p> <p>Zuckerberg's first public appearance was on a technology platform in September \u2013 he talked 10 to the dozen for 20 minutes about the new realities of his business. His message had changed somewhat in the months since the YouTube clip. There was a little less emphasis on the incontrovertible value of pursuing an open and connected world and a little more on the prospect of specific plans for generating increased advertising revenue from \"monetising eyeballs\". Zuckerberg admitted the company's previous strategy for mobile (he pronounced the word to rhyme with \"no bull\") had been wrong. But without too many specifics, he was confident Facebook could eventually make more money per user on mobile phones than on desktops. He was also in the bizarre position, having lately made a&#xa0;good many of his staff wealthy beyond reason, of having to face questions about office morale and employee retention. He talked soberly of incentive packages and share schemes, and hoped that his people would stay with him: \"It is not the first up and down we have had.\"</p> <p>One of the things Facebook has added to the culture in the few years of its existence has been a redefinition of some of the most common elements of our language. It has, according to the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, changed our understanding of the words \"like\" and \"friend\", not to mention \"poke\". It&#xa0;is, Zuckerberg hinted, about to tamper with the dictionary entry for \"want\" in the same way. Users will be able to have the product they want at the click of a mouse.</p> <p>The shifting of linguistic usage extends pointedly to the purpose of the company itself. As David Kirkpatrick, Facebook's authorised biographer, notes, one characteristic of the first eight years was a tendency for Zuckerberg and his inner circle to sit around late at night and try to establish exactly what business they were in. These reported conversations are remarkable, in a way, for their lack of clarity. Early on Zuckerberg liked to refer to his creation as \"a directory of people\" in these discussions (arguably not the most marketable of propositions); Sean Parker, the maverick first president of the company, used to suggest Facebook was \"a device you carried around and pointed at people and it would tell you all about them\". Later Zuckerberg resolved that it was a product \"to help people understand the world around them\".</p> <p>If that was its higher purpose, however, the business Facebook has been in from the start is&#xa0;disclosure. Its products are its users and their friends, who willingly supply personal data about themselves and their habits and tastes on a scale previously unimaginable. Its clients are corporations which can exploit that information to understand an individual's desires and to sell them things based on that knowledge. Facebook's data bank can in this way do empirically what Don Draper of <em>Mad Men</em> did instinctively \u2013 it will reveal its users' moment-by-moment wants, conscious and subconscious, and attempt to satisfy them.</p> <p>Zuckerberg's genius has been to find a way to not only track and store all of that data but also to make it accountable to an identifiable individual, all in the process of \"sharing\". Facebook rightly makes great capital of its uniquely \"granular\" privacy tools while whispering all the time about the liberating virtues of total transparency and openness. In this it shares a philosophy with its great rival, Google. As Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, once observed of the implicit contract of internet usage: \"If you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.\"</p> <p>Given that its product is its community, you would have thought that Facebook's announcement earlier this month that it had signed up its one-billionth user might have sparked a rally in its share price. In fact that announcement produced not a blip in the markets, which maintained stubbornly that Facebook was worth less than half what it had been on 18 May. To celebrate the remarkable statistic that one in six people on the planet was now a Facebook user, Zuckerberg noted on his home page another new definition of what his company had become. \"We belong to a rich tradition of people making things that bring us together,\" he wrote. \"We honour the humanity of the people we serve. We honour the everyday things people have always made to bring us together: chairs, doorbells, airplanes, bridges, games.\"</p> <p>This curious list, which sounded like it had been conceived after one too many hackathons, re-emerged a few days later as Facebook's first-ever piece of brand advertising. A&#xa0;commercial to be released in 13 key territories visualised Zuckerberg's extended simile: Facebook was like a chair, because people connect with each&#xa0;other when they sit together. That kind of thing.</p> <p>On message boards and blog posts the advert also appeared to suggest a&#xa0;quality that Facebook had never previously communicated and which is arguably the last thing an advert really needs: desperation. The ad was the work of Wieden + Kennedy, which is credited with the \"Just do it\" branding for Nike, but you can't help feeling its sentiment was Zuckerberg's own. The CEO likes to talk in mantras, and the one he has been repeating for a few years now is the apparently neat idea that \"Facebook is a utility\". This then was his somewhat clunky attempt to show that Facebook's \"place on earth\" was now a fixture; it is literally part of the furniture.</p> <p>Is that true? Certainly for millions of its avid and addicted updaters it may sometimes seem that Facebook has become as fundamental to their lives as electricity. Existence without Facebook may be social suicide in those quarters, but could it really be said to have become a&#xa0;necessity? Zuckerberg, seldom shy of ambition, is placing his faith in the idea that it is, or that one day soon it will be. The share price depends on it. He wants us to believe his company will be not one communication platform among many, but will pretty much make up a&#xa0;global network itself. Zuckerberg has, until very recently, an enviable track record of being right in such hunches. And undoubtedly there is an argument that given both its reach and its financial muscle Facebook is here for good and that things can only get better. It may still be that the YouTube clip will be played to future generations in history lessons as the moment when the means by which they most naturally engaged was first formally valued by the world \u2013 and that after a summer of discontent its growth never let up. Or it may just look like the best of times for the social network, and that nothing of&#xa0;the future was ever quite so sunny.</p>",

  "<p>Energy is vital for our everyday needs, it is one of the largest household costs, it is core to our economic recovery \u2013 but rarely has it been the focus of political and media attention.</p> <p>Straight after the 2010 election, David Cameron came to the department of energy and climate change to set our mission. We had to deliver new investment to keep the lights on, we had to respond to consumers' concerns about prices and, of course, we had to be the greenest government ever.</p> <p>It was a mission that showed the prime minister \"got\" energy. He knew that you can't have energy security without renewables, that you can't keep the lights on without a step change in investment, but that there are limits to what consumers would, or could, pay. For the first time in years, the UK would have an energy policy.</p> <p>That meant getting away from the sterile debate that you were only pro-consumer if you were against the energy companies and vice versa. The reality is different. As old plants close, we need twice as much investment in replacement plants this decade as Labour achieved in the last. Drive investors away and in a few years supply won't meet demand, forcing prices up and businesses into shutdown.</p> <p>The government rightly acted to reduce demand with better insulation and the green deal. But that cannot help most people struggling to pay their bills today, so the prime minister is right that more needs to be done to get consumers the best deal.</p> <p>However, we should also use this moment for an honest debate about how we pay for our future energy needs. In recent years, UK electricity and gas prices have been some of the cheapest in the EU because we had an abundant supply of our own gas and because, frankly, not enough was being spent to build new power stations. So we have to catch up now for that failure to invest over many years.</p> <p>It also goes to the heart of decisions about what sources of energy we use.As a minister, I recognised the continuing need for gas. Indeed, I approved more gas power stations and encouraged more licence applications for the North Sea than any previous minister.</p> <p>But our future can't depend on gas alone. Shale gas can make a contribution (although not without community backlashes, I suspect), but cannot bring the UK the same benefits as in America, where consents are much easier and prices are kept artificially low by the lack of export facilities. As the International Energy Agency says, we may face a golden age for gas, but don't assume it will be cheap. Last year's energy price rises owed more to rising global wholesale gas prices than anything else, so betting the farm on shale brings serious risks of future price rises.</p> <p>Energy security can only be delivered with a mix of technologies. New nuclear helps to give energy independence. Renewables harness the exceptional resources of these islands. Carbon capture and storage creates long-term opportunities for coal and gas. But no single source is fully secure.</p> <p>Harnessing our low-carbon potential isn't just right environmentally, but it is a central plank of energy security. If the world's major oil and gas economies, such as Saudi Arabia and Norway, want to use low-carbon sources themselves, it has to be right for us too.</p> <p>But there isn't much time left. Decisions on where to invest are being made now. Uncertainty and hostility would undermine the UK's ability to secure the jobs and economic benefits from the supply chain for those new power plants. And if those companies walk away from the UK, it is a permanent loss and we all pay the price.</p> <p>The prime minister set a clear energy strategy two years ago. Much has been done to deliver the right mechanisms. This is our chance for a win-win-win outcome, an outcome that is good for energy security, for the environment and for consumers. Now we need to get on with it.</p> <p><em>Charles Hendry was minister of state for energy and climate change 2010-2012.</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Yvonne Roberts</strong> It's been a very interesting week for feminism. Netmums has announced that feminism is dead and pronounced the last rites. But at the same time we've had the coverage of the Jimmy Savile revelations and a very strong feminist voice saying that this is an institutional problem, not just the behaviour of one individual. So feminism, is it alive or is it dead? Fiona?</p> <p><strong>Fiona Ranford</strong> The news from Netmums isn't surprising. We're all well aware that there's been stigma attached to feminism for many years, making it seem like it's something that is done and dusted, and actually what we're seeing across the UK is a huge rise in the number of women \u2013 and men \u2013 taking part in feminist activism. So we've seen a doubling in the number of local feminist activist groups in the past couple of years. We've seen a thousand people come to UK Feminista's national conference, which sold out. We've also got a huge lobby of parliament this week, where hundreds of women and men from across the UK will be coming together to demand that feminism is put at the heart of British politics and many of them will be doing feminist activism for the first time. So it's clear that the feminist movement is growing.</p> <p><strong>Rehana Azam</strong> I don't think feminism is dead. As a trade union officer active in the workplace, I've seen the gender pay gap growing significantly over the past decade. So I think there's a very real need for [feminism] in the workplaces, for us to fight for equality.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But if equal pay is such an issue, why are so many women saying \"We don't need feminism any more. Everything's OK\"?</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> I don't think feminism is dead. It depends what your interpretation of feminism is. My interpretation is all about having the freedom to choose. I don't think if you asked some of my members in the workplaces, are they the ones who are choosing the rates of pay they are on, which, compared to those of men, are less? I think the answer would be no, they aren't.</p> <p><strong>Melissa Kite</strong> I sincerely hope feminism is alive. If younger women are rejecting it or saying it's irrelevant, it's only because the women who've gone before them have won so many battles that they now can't see what the problem is. But I think the problem now is much more subtle than it used to be, and sexism \u2013 if you like, chauvinism \u2013 is not as obvious; it doesn't hit you over the head, maybe. It's very insidious, very subtle, the ways that women might still be kept down. There are still women in this country of different cultures who do not have the rights that I have, for example. And I think there is a very difficult problem nowadays of equality and women's rights coming up against other cultural so-called rights, religious rights. And these two agendas bash up against each other and women are stuck in the middle of things like forced marriage, female circumcision, women not being able to get a divorce because their husband has divorced them in a religious sense, in a Sharia sense.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Rehana, you actually had first-hand experience, didn't you, of a forced marriage?</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> Yes, at the age of 17, and unfortunately I didn't get the right to choose at that stage. But I'm pleased to say that I managed to challenge my family and I'm now on the other side because of some of the westernised environments that I've had the opportunity to be part of.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But is feminism too white, too posh, too middle-class, too obsessed with how many women are in the boardroom? Should it not argue much more strenuously, for example, about the impact of austerity hitting women much, much harder at the moment than it's hitting men?</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> Obviously we've seen slashing of services that women crucially rely on, and their benefits, and a very disproportionate loss of jobs for women. I think that shows that gender inequality is clearly quite overt.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> So where's the anger?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Well, indeed. Nowadays younger women are saying, \"Well, we don't want a sisterhood\" because they're all right, Jack. But if a sisterhood means anything, it's women standing together. So feminism shouldn't mean something strident, it should mean women standing together. It doesn't matter what culture you're from, I want to stand with you to give you the rights or freedoms and advantages that I'm enjoying.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Rehana, you've talked about choice but a lot of women would say \"it's my choice to go pole dancing\", \"it's my choice to have cosmetic surgery\", \"it's my choice to wear a pinny and cook cupcakes\". And then you have a lot of highly qualified women who are now saying they want to be at home full time. And that will obviously have an impact on their husbands. Because if you've got one person at home full time you're actually inhibiting the choices of the other person who has to go back to the traditional role of full-time breadwinner. So is choice a seductive word that can actually be quite toxic?</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> I think that we need to switch attention away from the individual choices that women are making and turn attention on to the institutions that are restricting those choices \u2013 for example, the media that is pumping out images of women that define how women think about their bodies and force them to shape their lives around beauty norms. We need to focus on what institutions are doing rather than just talking about individual women.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Just on this question of what women look like, in the Netmums survey women are saying that they no longer believe that being feminine or looking glamorous is a barrier to being taken seriously. Well, I would say that misses the point. I would say that now you have to be taken seriously and you have to be glamorous and feminine. It's almost like the notion of what a woman is, it's become bigger and bigger until you have to be absolutely everything. And this speaks to what a woman is in the home as well. So yes, we have choice. We can have children, we can work. But actually what's happened in practice is that we're having to do all of it. And that's no good for men, because they are becoming emasculated.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> Challenging stereotypes \u2013 that is still a very big issue, isn't it? The Women in Work Commission in 2006 did quite a lot of research into stereotype and gender segregation, occupation segregation and the big issue around that was careers advice. It was almost like girls were put in a particular direction because they...</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Air hostess, secretary, nurse.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> ...We've got to start developing aspirations. If you look at the current key workplace issues, the gender pay gap which is widening, the austerity measures which mean public sector workers are being made redundant \u2013 predominantly women, part-time women who can't get the flexibility so they have to go part time. So it goes back to the point that you were making, Fiona, about institutions having to take responsibility. In the 1990s, around the Macpherson report, there was institutionalised racism and a lot of discussion and debate around that. But institutionalised sexism is something that we have almost acknowledged, but the BBC, the Savile stuff that's coming out, it's institutionalised sexism, it's institutions that have to take responsibility.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Do women still in many instances feel like visitors in a male world?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Yes, I'm sure. I became a political journalist 10 years ago and when I joined the lobby you could count on one hand the number of female political journalists. It's very different today.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But joining the system isn't the same as changing it.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> You have a critical mass and it's transformed, I think, beyond recognition. It is not male-dominated any more and therefore the way women, the way political correspondents, report has changed because there are lots of women doing it and we do things slightly differently. There's more emphasis on how politicians feel about decisions, it's much more emotive. The feminisation of society.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> In a way, feelings and emotions is a very stereotypical view of what women's interests are. Inevitably women are the fluffy part of a newspaper, on the whole.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Yes, we need different types of women in the media, but the celebrity obsessed culture, it's all about Kim Kardashian and all the rest of it, and women are becoming caught up in this. There is no expectation on what men look like \u2013 still. It is all about what women look like.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Fiona, in some ways men are in a similar position that women were in the 1960s, they are beginning to realise that they have other choices apart from just being a breadwinner; men are much more involved in their children. They're being forced to face unemployment, which means they have to find another identity. Should that be a stronger part of the feminist agenda?</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> Feminism has always been about building a society that is better for everyone, and that includes men. And I think, yes, there's a lot of men who are getting involved in the feminist movement because they're realising A, that it's a huge task we have on our hands and we need all hands on deck; and B, it affects them deeply. Men are affected by pornography, for example from, I think, the average age for boys seeing pornography being 11. Pornography is often violent and degrading to women and that's how a lot of young boys are getting their ideas around who women are and what sex is like. It's really important that we tackle that, because that's really impoverishing for women and men.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> You have to look at it from a global perspective. I've been fortunate. I've been to Haiti and I've seen first-hand how women are oppressed in the 21st century in the workplaces. I met a group of fantastic women in Sierra Leone at the first ever women's labour conference that they managed to organise after a decade of absolutely awful stuff, and those women said: \"The only people who are going to be in charge of our destiny is us.\" The point that Melissa was making about the sisterhood is absolutely right. Because along the way we've moved in to different groups' internal discussion about right, left and centre and all the rest of it, rather than globally trying to eradicate injustice and have dignity.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> How wide is the political spectrum here?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Centre-right, I'd describe myself.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> I'm leftwing.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> So where do you differ?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> I differ more about lumping everything on the shoulders of government and organisations. I believe in more individual responsibility, what I can do personally, for example, to mentor or support any woman I come across. I got on because older women in media gave me moral support and encouragement. That meant the world to me. Men have been doing this for each other since time began \u2013 the clubbable aspect of the old boys' network.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Where change has really happened is when women have taken direct action, where they've actually defied the stereotypes.</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> I think that's definitely a key tactic; it has had huge successes in the past in winning women the vote and now it's still playing a key role. So we saw women lying down outside parliament to try to block the chancellor's budget. They wanted to demonstrate how crucial it was that this agenda doesn't happen because it's fundamentally taking women backwards.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Women have taxation without representation. That hasn't changed. There are very few women still in positions of power.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> But then it goes back to the whole institutional problem. If you look at the front benches in terms of how many women influence and make decisions, there are very few. So although we've made strides, we just haven't come far enough. I agree with Melissa: we've all got an individual responsibility but we also have a collective responsibility and it's this that's going to really mobilise that change. And if we take direct action, then so be it, because it's high time, isn't it? I have responsibility for the National Health Service, services are being fragmented every single day. The British public need to wake up and understand what's happening to their NHS and we've got to challenge that. Predominantly, women are going to be the ones looking after the children, the elderly parents, and we're going to need those services. And I think this is where collective action is going to be really important.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> It took a Labour government to do a lot on equality, and I will always give it credit for that. But this issue of marches and being radical and strident \u2013 I'm aware that women chained themselves to railings, and thank goodness they did and I'm grateful to them. But when you do that now you do get a lot of scorn from men. And so, in terms of turning people off, it's a very difficult balance.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> But isn't that inevitably the role of feminism, or any political activity, that it's not really working unless somebody's feeling appalled by it?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Or do you bring this change in by proving that women in the workplace are a massive asset?</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> That's not changing the system, that's keeping the system going.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> If I can just come in on equal pay audits: what it means is if, as a woman in a workplace, you feel that you are doing exactly the same work as a male counterpart, you should have the ability to challenge that.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> You've got to counter that by saying that if you burden employers with so much \u2013 very well-meaning \u2013 legislation designed to boost women, you are going to end up with some employers saying \"I'm not going to employ a woman\" because it's too much trouble. I'm sorry, but that is the reality.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> But with the greatest respect, Melissa, the whole point of equal pay audits is to get equality.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> But it's so hard to say what is exactly the same job, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> There's plenty of measures through an evaluation where you can identify whether there is that parity.</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> I'm not sure I would use legislation. I'm more cautious about what red tape you burden employers with in order to achieve very good ends or what you leave up to the individual woman to fight her corner herself. I wouldn't want legislation that impeded my ability to go into a company \u2026 an employer was thinking if I take on another woman you know there's going to be all sorts of problems.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> But unless you've got the tools available to challenge it yourself, you'd be in a situation where it doesn't change and we're never going to address the gender pay gap.</p> <p><strong>FR </strong>I don't think that we can just imagine that feminism's going to come, that gender equality is going to come about on its own through a few policy makers behind closed doors. I think real political change happens through mass movements, always has.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> In the 1960s there was a very simple four goals for feminism, including 24-hour childcare, abortion rights, equal pay. Are there goals that you would put at the top of the list now?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Equal rights for all women in our society, regardless of culture and religion.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> And a second?</p> <p><strong>MK</strong> Choice.</p> <p><strong>FR</strong> The feminism movement is hugely diverse: people are calling for different things, but ultimately what they are all calling for is gender equality.</p> <p><strong>RA</strong> I do strongly fundamentally believe in choice. If you've got choice, you can develop the equality.</p> <p><strong>YR</strong> Hooray. Thank you very much. That was great.</p>",
  "<p>For about 15 years, I have covered the ups and downs of literary London in these pages, a mixture of reviews, columns, interviews and commentary. It was, in hindsight, a snapshot of an extraordinary moment in the world of books. One of the questions that vexed us most in the years immediately before and after the millennium was the \"paradigm shift\" of the e-revolution. Lost in a fog of change, we asked: what does it mean? What is the future of the book?</p> <p>Today's answer is that ebooks are a wonderful new way of publishing quickly and cheaply, of responding to an opportunity, on behalf of readers, worldwide. Digitised reading has become a global liberation: long or short, ebooks can satisfy the hungry reader's palate at very low cost, and at the click of a mouse. Plus, their influence is benign. Ebooks, we now see, do not mean the death of the book.&#xa0;Actually, the reverse is true. Hardbacks have been invigorated by ebook publishing.</p> <p>I feel this all the more acutely because, for the first time in my literary career, I have just published not one, but three ebooks (priced \u00a32.99 each) Each is about 30,000 words long, or 100 pages of conventional text, and each is compiled from my <em>Observer</em> journalism. There's an ebook called <em>On Reading: Notes on the Literary Landscape, 1995-2012</em>. A companion volume, <em>On Writing</em>, and finally <em>On Authors</em>, a collection of interviews with some contemporary greats (including Seamus Heaney, Norman Mailer and VS Naipaul) completes the set. All three are published by <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/showSubCategories.do?category=1710\" title=\"\">Guardian Books</a>, and should be available via all good online bookstores.</p>",
  "<p>The bad (as in rotten, ridiculous) news last week claimed that the <em>Guardian </em>was on the point of abandoning print and turning into an online-only non-paper paper. The good (as in obviously correct) news claimed that it isn't \u2013 and heaven knows why the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> thought this secondhand sub-tweet of gossip worth publishing. But bad news and good news have a curious way of getting mixed up in the wild, woolly world of media futures.</p> <p>It isn't superficially stupid to think of great print brands operating in digital alone. That's precisely what will happen to <em>Newsweek</em> as 2012 ends. No more printing presses, only Newsweek Global on a laptop or iPad near you. But this isn't the seamless transition from past to glowing future that some apostles bathe in hope. <em>Newsweek</em>, in spite of gallant efforts to rescue its news magazine format, was sold for one dollar last time around and loses millions year after year. It can't be fixed. Any digital reincarnation (if recent experience of such tottery transitions is any guide) may have to try to operate on no more than a third of its current editorial cost base.</p> <p>Why? Because online advertising \u2013 see Google \u2013 isn't some continuing wonder of growth and prosperity. It remains mostly stuck around 12% to 15% of what you can charge in print. Just look at the headlines from the London <em>Evening Standard </em>to get the point. It used to lose \u00a318m or so when Associated ran it in a conventional way. Then, three years ago, the new Lebedev management (led by Andy Mullins) turned it free. And, in the financial 12 months just ended, big losses have turned to modest profit.</p> <p>Free newspapers only have one real source of income: print advertising. Last year the <em>Standard</em> raised over \u00a350m that way. This year \u2013 though the figures aren't all laid bare yet \u2013 the growth has been double-digit. In short, the most dramatic newspaper turnaround in Britain so far this millennium depends on giving copies away and charging advertisers a premium rate they'll pay. Back to a future that still seems to work.</p> <p>Which is why, of course, that <em>Telegraph</em> tale about <em>Guardian</em> plans was rubbish. <em>Guardian</em> revenue still depends hugely on print, as the group's chief executive made clear. You can't do without it: you have to sustain it. Good news and bad news arrive in the same open envelope.</p>",
  "<p>There have been a number of movies dealing with the gulf coast of Louisiana after the disaster of hurricane Katrina, the most notable being Spike Lee's four-hour documentary <em>When the Levees Broke</em> made in 2006, and the oddest being Werner Herzog's cop movie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131630/bad-lieutenant\" title=\"\"><em>The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans</em></a>, three years later. The setting apart, neither has much in common with the low-budget independent production <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em>, a fable set in a remote corner of the bayou where a mixed-race community of eccentrics live on floating huts or primitive houses raised on stilts. They get around on improvised boats and share their homes with the domestic animals they feed off. The central character is the six-year-old Hushpuppy who lives with her ailing father Wink, a hard-drinking fisherman. Everything is filtered through her wondering mind, and she acts as a precocious, puzzled commentator.</p> <p>An eloquent, apocalyptical schoolmistress, who teaches all the local kids in the one-room schoolhouse, has fed her ideas about the interdependence of everything in the world and the imminent possibility of radical change in the environment through global warming. In a tale where stark realism, surrealism and dream intermingle, she survives the Noah-like deluge, is forcibly taken in by well-meaning doctors and social workers, and escapes to recover her old life and take off on a journey in search of her mother.</p> <p>Ending much like Terrence Malick's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/139929/tree-of-life\" title=\"\"><em>The Tree of Life</em></a>, which also moves from the prehistoric to the apocalyptic, the film is variously poetic, mysterious and opaque, a bit like the work of the African director Souleymane Ciss\u00e9 but without the depth. The non-professional actors Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis and Dwight Henry are persuasive as Hushpuppy and Wink, and I'd assumed that they were from backgrounds similar to that of the characters they play. Henry is in fact a successful baker and deli proprietor in New Orleans, while Wallis is a nine-year old Miley Cyrus fan, whose passions include reading, video games, basketball and cheerleading.</p>",
  "<p>Government backing for new forms of gas extraction such as \"fracking\" are under acute scrutiny after a sacked energy minister warned against \"betting the farm\" on them and green groups expressed alarm at links between the fossil fuel lobby and the Tories.</p> <p>The Observer has established that two key executives of the energy trading giant Vitol, whose boss has given more than \u00a3500,000 to the Conservatives, were personal shareholders in a company bringing \"hydraulic fracturing\", commonly known as fracking, and a related technology, coal bed methane (CBM) extraction, to the UK.</p> <p>But doubts are growing over whether such technologies can deliver the cheap energy prices the gas lobby claims.</p> <p><a href=\"www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/21/energy-policy-david-cameron-shale-gas\">Writing for the Observer</a>, former energy minister Charles Hendry, who lost his job in the reshuffle, warns that shale gas \"cannot bring the UK the same benefits as in America, where consents are much easier and prices are kept artificially low by the lack of export facilities\".</p> <p>After a week in which David Cameron staked his credibility on reducing energy bills, Hendry writes: \"We may face a golden age for gas, but don't assume it will be cheap. Last year's energy price rises owed more to rising global wholesale gas prices than anything else, so betting the farm on shale brings serious risks of future price rises.\"</p> <p>The previously unpublicised interests of two Vitol executives, Bob Finch, its head of trading, and Christopher Bake, managing director of Vitol, Dubai, in \"unconventional gas extraction\" assets suggests they believe it could be a major source of energy. </p> <p>Alan Duncan, the international development minister, worked for Vitol in the 1990s and was a consultant for another company part-owned by Vitol.</p> <p>Ian Taylor, its chief executive, who has donated around \u00a3550,000 to the Conservatives, was a guest at an intimate dinner party with David Cameron in his Downing Street flat last November. Weeks after the private dinner - for people who had donated more than \u00a350,000 to the Tories - it emerged that Vitol had supplied oil to rebels in Libya. The revelation prompted suggestions the deal had been brokered by the Foreign Office, a claim comprehensively rejected by Vitol.</p> <p>Last month, Vitol admitted it had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil. The Swiss-based company said: \"A Bahraini subsidiary company purchased a spot cargo of fuel oil from a non-Iranian counterparty in July 2012. The fuel oil delivered ... was of Iranian origin. Vitol Group companies no longer purchase any product of Iranian origin.\"</p> <p>Joss Garman, a campaigner with Greenpeace, said: \"Call me cautious, but these don't sound like the kind of people we want to be entrusting with our land, countryside and climate.

He is also managing director of Riverstone Holdings, which has oil and gas investments in the North Sea. Ben Moxham, who worked for Browne at BP and Riverstone, is now Cameron's energy adviser.</p> <p>A Cuadrilla site in Lancashire was forced to suspend test fracking in 2011 after two small earth tremors. In April a panel of experts appointed by the government ruled that test fracking could continue under stringent conditions.</p> <p>Finch and Bake, along with two venture capital firms, acquired a 16% stake in a company called Dart Energy after selling it to a company called Greenpark that has a licence to conduct exploratory fracking at a site on the Anglo-Scottish border.

Next February, Dart plans to start drilling 22 CBM wells on the bank of the river Forth, the largest venture of its kind in the UK.</p> <p>Dart is a member of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, which employs Australian lobbyists Crosby Textor. A former Crosby Textor lobbyist, Guy Robinson, is special adviser to the environment secretary, Owen Paterson. Paterson, accused by green groups of being a climate-change sceptic, has voiced support for fracking, describing shale reserves as \"one unexpected and potentially huge windfall\".</p> <p>Both fracking and CBM extraction are fiercely opposed by environmental groups. Fracking involves injecting fluid under high pressure to crack rocks underground and release the natural shale gas. The technique is banned in several countries, including France.</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 2 November 2012 to remove incorrect references to the Vitol Group being a shareholder in Dart Energy and to include Vitol's denial that the Foreign Office brokered a deal to supply oil to Libyan rebels</p>",
  "<p>While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/13/michael-gove-maths-reforms-flawed-charity\">politicians are still touting models rooted in rote learning</a>, teachers and leaders on the frontline of education are taking a far more collaborative approach.</p> <p>Take head teacher Tom Sherrington. Earlier this month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2012/oct/08/coconstructing-classes-pupils-teaching-tips#start-of-comments\">Tom gave us a fascinating glimpse into his co-constructed classrooms</a>. Here, the whole class is involved in planning what courses will look like, delivering lessons and also setting and marking homework and assignments.</p> <p>\"The aim,\" Tom writes, \"is to engender a deeper understanding of the subject but also to develop independent learning skills. What co-construction shows them is that they can learn anything they want to.\"</p> <p>Similar benefits have been driving the student voice agenda for years. In 2000, Scotland formalised its commitment to student participation by making it essential for education authorities to consider pupil's views in decisions that significantly affect that pupil in relation to his or her school education.</p> <p>From 2007 to 2009 Children in Scotland and University of Edinburgh carried out a major piece of research to gather evidence about pupil councils and in 2010 released a report, <a href=\"http://www.havingasayatschool.org.uk/promoting.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Having a Say at School</a>, that explored the impact, potential and barriers for pupil councils across the country.</p> <p>Its findings reinforced all the positives - confident, contributing and engaged students and citizens - and found, on the whole, that student councils are perceived as effective. But the headline findings also reveal that not enough time and poor communication can be a problem; and, in some schools, students not directly involved in the council didn't understand its purpose or always know what it was doing or working on.</p> <p>(For some further reading, exploring similar themes across the UK, Schools Councils UK released its <a href=\"http://www.myschoolcouncil.info/scuk_content/training_and_resources/Resources/Research%20and%20reports/School%20Councils%20-%20School%20Improvement/scuk_tr\" rel=\"nofollow\">School Councils School Improvement report</a> in 2007. More about this in Thursday's discussion.)</p> <p>Collaboration is also one of the key principles of our competition, The School We'd Like, where we are inviting students and teachers to come together to devise an idea for something they would change or introduce in their school. We can't wait to see all the ideas schools develop together.</p> <p>And, as all this is just scratching the surface, we're hosting a live debate to explore student-teacher collaboration, student voice, governance and beyond.

  "<p>Two hours before Cardiff Blues face Toulon in the Heineken Cup at the Arms Park on Sunday afternoon, delegates will gather in Port Talbot for the Welsh Rugby Union's annual general meeting. There will be a bout of self-congratulation with the governing body reporting record turnover and profits in the last financial year, but while they count the money the regional game scrimps and suffers.</p> <p>With the advent of professionalism in 1995, Cardiff were acquisitive. They were branded cheque-book Charlies by Lyn Jones, the current London Welsh director of rugby, who was then the Neath coach, for using money to assemble a team. But times have changed and the Blues, as the professional arm of Cardiff became when regionalism started in 2003, are struggling to hold on to their leading players and the only big names they attract are ones from second-tier countries with numerous consonants and vowels.</p> <p>Their wage bill is half of Toulon's. When the two clubs last met in the final of the Amlin Challenge Cup in 2010, the Blues were spearheaded by the former All Blacks Xavier Rush, Casey Laulala and Ben Blair; they are now former players and other internationals who are not with the side include Gethin Jenkins, who was been warming Toulon's bench this season, and Martyn Williams.</p> <p>Toulon's turnover of players has been even greater, with only five of their 22 that day still with the club. But whereas the Blues have tended to replace experience with youth or cheaper players from emerging nations, the Top 14 club now boast the likes of Matt Giteau, Andrew Sheridan, Mathieu Bastareaud, Chris Masoe and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak.</p> <p>\"We are in a similar position to Cardiff in 2002, just before the start of regional rugby,\" says the Blues director of rugby, Phil Davies, \"when players like Rob Howley and Jonathan Humphreys moved on. Like Toulon, we are building a team; we are just in a different phase of development.\"</p> <p>Davies joined Cardiff from Worcester in the summer and has endured a challenging start after a number of players left in the summer. Two of his Wales grand slam-winning squad players, Jamie Roberts and Alex Cuthbert, are out of contract in the summer with French clubs poised with offers to double their salaries.</p> <p>\"The regional game needs to rise to the top of the WRU's priorities,\" says Mike Cuddy, a member of the Ospreys board who stood down as the region's joint managing director earlier this month. \"I have spent 25 years in the front line of Welsh rugby and it has never been more onerous. Where will we be in five years?</p> <p>\"It's all well and good the governing body making big profits but what will it profit them if there is no professional rugby in Wales worthy of the name outside the international tier? Who wants the Welsh football scenario to be replicated in rugby where having an international player ply his trade inside the country is the exception rather than the rule, and where the top tier of domestic competition is so far removed from Test level that it attracts only a few hundred diehard supporters?</p> <p>\"The time has come for the WRU to embark on some joined-up thinking and planning.\"</p> <p>The four regions this season agreed a salary cap of \u00a33.5m. The emphasis is on developing youth, but this time last year few outside Cardiff, and his native Gloucester, had heard of Cuthbert: a grand slam later and he is in demand. Are the regions going to turn into suppliers for the well-off?</p> <p>\"It is all about growing over the next couple of years,\" says Davies. \"Having worked for the WRU, I know they are working hard with the regions to make things work: a lot is going on behind the scenes. At the Blues we want to build and get stronger, not just keeping our top players but recruiting well and adding quality. Is the game here at a crossroads? I think it is an exciting time for all four regions.\"</p> <p>Ospreys face Leicester at Welford Road shortly after the final whistle at the Arms Park. Whatever the results, Cuddy fears the club game in England and France will engorge the regions. \"The BT Vision deal in England threatens to put the English clubs out of sight, while the position in France is even more stark, tie-ups with local authorities supplementing big bucks TV money.</p> <p>\"The WRU is Wales's fifth region, more competitor than friend, flooding the market with hundreds of thousands of tickets that allow fans to get their rugby fix at the Millennium Stadium rather than anywhere else. They spend hundreds of thousands of pounds promoting their games, selling against their own regions at key times of the year, yet they produce none of the players and bear little of their wage costs. We have to be in this together.\"</p> <p>Wales have won three grand slams in the past eight seasons, but no Welsh region has secured the Heineken Cup. \"That will happen sooner rather than later,\" says Davies, but the fear of Blues' supporters as they gather at the Arms Park to watch a French version, albeit in a more extravagant way, of what Cardiff used to be is that in future achievement will be seen as qualifying for the Heineken Cup, not bringing home the trophy and that the WRU will be a profit without honour in its own land.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron was battling to shore up his authority on two fronts as it emerged that a revolt by young Tory MPs forced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-police-pleb\" title=\"Andrew Mitchell resigns following allegations he called police 'plebs'\">the resignation of Andrew Mitchell</a>, and party grandees \u2013 led by Lord Tebbit \u2013 broke cover to question the government's competence.</p> <p>With Downing Street still reeling from the decision by Mitchell to quit on Friday, after Cameron spent four weeks defending him, sources said a lack of support from the 2010 intake of Tory MPs finally persuaded him he had insufficient authority left.</p> <p>News of the \"youth revolt\" is a serious threat to Cameron's authority, suggesting that dozens of MPs who were overlooked in the recent reshuffle are now prepared to rebel rather than be loyal in the hope of eventual preferment.</p> <p>Sources said that when Mitchell toured the Commons tea rooms on Wednesday and Thursday, he was taken aback by the opposition to him staying put, despite Cameron's support.</p> <p>The news comes as the former Tory chairman Norman Tebbit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/20/david-cameron-andrew-mitchell-crisis\">tears into Cameron and the coalition</a>, saying its problems stem not from too many \"toffs\" but a lack of basic competence.</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer,</em> Tebbit says: \"This dog of a coalition government has let itself be given a bad name and now anybody can beat it. It has let itself be called a government of unfeeling toffs. Past governments have had far more real Tory toffs: prime ministers Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Macmillan, or even in Thatcher's day, Whitelaw, Soames, Hailsham, Carrington, Gowrie, Joseph, Avon, Trenchard and plenty more, without incurring similar abuse.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"The abiding sin of the government is not that some ministers are rich, but that it seems unable to manage its affairs competently.\"</p> <p>Mitchell quit over claims that he called police officers \"plebs\" and \"morons\" \u2013 something he strongly denies. He has admitted that he swore at police when they barred him from taking his bike through the main Downing Street gate.</p> <p>The resignation, coupled with claims that the chancellor, George Osborne, sat in a first-class train seat with a standard-class ticket, followed a week of confusion over energy policy. The events earned the Tory party fiercely critical headlines on Saturday, even in normally supportive papers such as the <em>Daily Mail</em>.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> understands that Tebbit's concerns are shared by a growing number of senior Tory donors who believed Mitchell should have been sacked earlier. Sources said some of the largest contributors to the party are also questioning whether Cameron has the clarity of purpose to lead the coalition.</p> <p>In a scathing critique Tebbit says Cameron needs to find leadership skills and impose \"some managerial discipline not just on his colleagues but on himself. Had Mr Miliband concentrated his fire on a long list of muddles from the proposed sale of our national forests to the BAE and energy policy muddles of recent days it would have been far worse.\"</p> <p>A new Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll, conducted before the Mitchell resignation and Osborne rail fare furore, puts Labour on 40%, nine points ahead of the Tories on 31%. The Lib Dems are on 9%, just behind Ukip on 10%. Despite Labour's lead, the Tories still have a slight edge on the economy. When asked who they would trust most to run the economy, 30% said the Tories and 29% Labour.</p> <p>On Saturday Downing Street tried to hit back, insisting it was time to trumpet the government's achievements in cutting the deficit, unemployment and NHS waiting lists and increasing the number of people in work. On Monday Cameron will make a major speech on crime. His new \"tough but intelligent\" approach will signal the end of his infamous \"hug a hoodie\" image on law and order.</p> <p>Tory MPs and ministers said they were becoming exasperated about policy failings, particularly after the PM appeared to announce a new policy on energy prices of which the Department of Energy and Climate Change had been unaware.</p> <p>The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, was on Saturday among dozens of speakers at a TUC-organised march in London against austerity. Other rallies took place in Glasgow and Belfast.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"Andrew Mitchell may finally have resigned. But the culture of two nations runs right across this government. They cut taxes for millionaires. And they raise taxes for ordinary families. They leave young people out of work while the bonuses at the banks carry on. They even have a chancellor of the exchequer who tries to travel first-class on a standard-class ticket. It's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everybody else: everybody like you who plays their part and does the right thing. The trouble with this government is that while they are think they are born to rule, it turns out they are not very good at it.\"</p> <p>Grant Shapps, the Tory chairman, said Miliband was leading Labour back \"to the days of Michael Foot\".</p> <p>\"The world has changed. Britain is in a global race. That's why we're dealing with our debts, getting people back to work and keeping mortgage rates low.</p> <p>\"Ed Miliband and his union paymasters are turning a blind eye to all that. By marching with them, Ed Miliband proved he still stands for more spending, more borrowing and more debt.</p>",
  "<p>The scandal at the BBC has deepened as it emerged that presenters who have had complaints raised against them have been allowed to go on working without facing any formal investigation.</p> <p>It comes as BBC bosses face accusations from senior journalists that there was a smear campaign against the victims who had come forward with accounts of Jimmy Savile's predatory sexual behaviour. The corporation is bracing itself for Monday night's <em>Panorama</em>, looking into why the BBC shelved an expos\u00e9 of Savile's prolific sexual offending then within weeks aired a glowing tribute to the dead star.</p> <p>The programme's makers have asked for an extension to the usual 30-minute running time for the documentary and may yet go beyond a 60-minute slot.</p> <p>What is clear is the high levels of anger among BBC staff, not only those involved in the shelved <em>Newsnight</em> film, but also a wider disquiet at a culture that allows star presenters to take liberties with their position and in which allegations against them, particularly of sexual harassment or impropriety, are not adequately dealt with.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> has learned that several women producers who worked with the historian Adam Hart-Davis have accused him of making them uncomfortable with sexual comments and inappropriate touching. One alleges that in 2004 staff working with him were warned to keep their distance, even staying in a different hotel when on location. \"I thought it was unfair that we would be warned, but a presenter wouldn't be expected to change his behaviour,\" she said.</p> <p>Hart-Davis, 69, a second cousin of David Cameron and distantly related to the Queen, said that he had no knowledge of employees being warned to keep their distance from him.</p> <p>\"I have not worked for productions within the BBC for many years,\" he said. \"I was never warned, although I was once informed by a senior figure that I had offended a female employee. I had not meant to do so, and I greatly regret having annoyed her.\"</p> <p>Kate Kinninmont of Women in Film and TV (UK) said there were real risks if presenters were seen to be above reproach: \"It's not just sexual inappropriateness but also bullying and exploitation that happens when junior members of staff, women and men on short-term contracts and knowing there are 100 other people just waiting to step into their shoes, are not properly protected because the talent is seen as being held in such high regard that there is a power imbalance.\"</p> <p>On Monday, attention will switch to why <em>Newsnight</em> dropped its investigation. Liz MacKean, a <em>Newsnight</em> journalist, has given an interview to <em>Panorama</em> in which she is expected to describe the case they had assembled against Savile as \"undeniable\".</p> <p>Reporters involved in the expos\u00e9 are said to be hugely concerned at the BBC's handling of the fallout of the story. It was revealed that MacKean told BBC director general George Entwistle a fortnight ago that he was giving staff the wrong explanation of why the original story was dropped. She says the BBC has been issuing \"misleading statements\".</p> <p>One senior corporation source said : \"What the BBC has been saying over the last three weeks I think is pretty sexist. The tack seems to be to pour scorn on the witnesses, to suggest they are on social networks so how reliable are they etc. All of that I find obviously very troubling. They are grasping around, it seems, for any excuse to justify the decision not to run the story and that includes suggesting the witnesses were not believable.\"</p> <p>MacKean and her colleague Meirion Jones, both respected investigative reporters, were only last week invited to give their version of events by Peter Horrocks, the BBC's director of global news, who is overseeing the BBC's continuing coverage. Entwistle did not ask to see either MacKean or Jones.</p> <p>In her email to Entwistle, dated 8&#xa0;October, which has been leaked to newspapers, MacKean denied Entwistle's assertion that the story was \"about the Surrey police investigation\" and rejected an account by <em>Newsnight</em> editor Peter Rippon, who posted a blog on 2 October, the day before ITV's documentary on Savile, explaining his decision to drop the BBC's story.</p> <p>\"Ever since the report was dropped, just ahead of it being edited, there have been repeated misleading statements from the press office about the nature of our investigation,\" MacKean wrote. \"To see what began as a BBC story running large on ITV is a hard thing. For it not to be mentioned in any way on <em>Newsnight </em>is another, quite absurd, thing. But worst of all has been what seems like a concerted effort to make it appear that our story was about something else, something that could be dropped and forgotten ahead of fulsome tribute programmes. It is this which seems to be fuelling the damaging claims of a cover-up.\"</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.30am: It's the day of the leader's speech. I'm in the press room in the concert hall in Perth where Alex Salmond's, Scotland's first minister, will be addressing the SNP this afternoon. It should be the highlight of the four-day conference, but Salmond will be hard pressed to produce anything as dramatic as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/19/snp-conference-nato-debate-live-blog\">yesterday's debate on Nato membership, which culminated in a narrow but significant victory for Salmond and the SNP leadership, who have persuaded the party to drop its historic opposition to an independent Scotland belonging to Nato.</a></p> <p>I will round up more reaction to yesterday's vote shortly.</p> <p>This morning there are two developments worth noting.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20010209\">Salmond has said that independence would allow the Scots to create \"a more prosperous and a more just society\"</a>. </strong>Normally at party conferences extracts from the leader's speech are released in advance. The SNP have done this, but they've only given us two sentences.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our cause is not and never has been just about a constitutional objective. It is about using the powers of an independent Scotland to create a more prosperous economy and a more just society.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/mobile/politics/referendum-news/pro-uk-survey-finds-just-16-strongly-back-independence.19192344?_=15266f95a279361b1d98843a4b30d1d5aec98361\">Better Together, the pro union campaign, has released a poll suggesting that only 16% of Scots \"strongly\" favour independence</a>. </strong>Responding to the poll, the SNP said that it also showed that more than a quarter of Labour voters and nearly a third of Lib Dem voters support an independent Scotland and that support for a yes vote had risen by 3% in under two weeks.</p> <p>Here's the agenda for the day.<br><em><br>10am:</em> Conference opens. There are debates on welfare, including a call for people to receive \"full pension and benefit payments\" when Scotland becomes independent, on the NHS and on development trusts.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Speech by Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish culture secretary.</p> <p><em>11.25am:</em> The president's prize, presented by Ian Hudghton MEP</p> <p><em>11.35am: </em>Fraternal address from Plaid Cymru.</p> <p><em>11.45am:</em> Speech by Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland.</p> <p><em>2pm:</em> Further debates. Resolutions being discussed this afternoon include international development, inequality, pensions, workfare and housing.</p> <p><em>3pm:</em> Alex Salmond, Scotland's first minister, speaks.</p> <p>I'll post a summary at lunchtime and another after Salmond has fininshed.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>10.21am: Here's a round-up of some of the reaction to yesterday's Nato vote at the conference.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/herald-view/nation-will-judge-snp-nato-policy.19192295\">The Herald in its leader says that the Nato vote was a victory for the SNP leadership but that the nation must now judge how credible the SNP's defence policy is</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Then there is the question of how feasible the party's new position on Nato actually is. Many delegates yesterday voiced their worries over this point. Nato membership would make it harder for an independent Scotland to rid itself of nuclear weapons, warned MSP Jamie Hepburn.</p> <p>German newspaper reports last month suggested that Nato had forced Germany to drop its aspiration to bring about the withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from its soil. Would any negotiation on the point even be possible? The assumption that it would, some opponents believe, is simply \"policy by assertion\". The pro-Union Better Together campaign, which was surely disappointed by yesterday's vote, will seek to exploit such doubts.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/opinion/comment/leaders-salmond-wins-nato-battle-but-war-is-still-to-be-won-1-2589611http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/opinion/comment/leaders-salmond-wins-nato-battle-but-war-is-still-to-be-won-1-2589611\">The Scotsman in its leader says the vote represented a major shift in policy</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Opponents, doubtless, will point to the narrowness of the majority and claim nationalists are divided, or to the caveats in the wording eventually approved to contend that the party's new stance is riddled with hypocrisy. But there is little doubt that yesterday's vote represented a major shift in policy. Moreover, it was achieved in an old-fashioned political way. </p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/close-call-as-snp-scraps-historic-anti-nato-stance.19192352\"> Robbie Dinwoodie in the Herald says those opposed to the SNP changing its policy on Nato have indicated that they will accept the result of yesterday's vote</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Christina McKelvie MSP] later said the vote would be respected and that no further action was expected from opponents to Nato membership. She added: \"Democracy was the winner today. Now we can put this behind us and focus on winning Yes votes.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\" http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/9621906/Salmond-wants-to-join-a-club-but-only-if-he-can-play-by-his-own-rules.html\">Alan Cochrane in the Daily Telegraph says the SNP's defence policy is now marked by \"hopeless incongruity\"</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They've said that as Scotland is currently, through the United Kingdom, a member of Nato it should, as an independent country, continue to be a member. However, in seeking to be so, its negotiators \u2013 step forward the aforesaid Alex Salmond \u2013 would tell the alliance's bigwigs that they'd only continue as a member \"subject to an agreement that Scotland will not host nuclear weapons\".</p> <p>It's called \"conditionality\" but it's actually a virtual negation of what Nato is all about; it is a nuclear alliance and its members accept as part of joining that they enjoy the shelter of what's always been called the \"nuclear umbrella\".</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/news/4599493/Nats-back-Nato.html\">Andrew Nicoll in the Scottish Sun says yesterday's vote makes the SNP look \"a lot more credible\"</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After all, yesterday's conference was packed with diplomatic observers from embassies around the world, watching to see where Scotland is heading.</p> <p>They will be reporting back today having seen a mature party of government in action, a party prepared to lead Scotland to its place on the world stage.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://councillorterrykelly.blogspot.com/2012/10/perth-snp-and-fighters-who-have-now.html\">Terry Kelly, a Labour councillor, says on his blog that the Nato vote marks a defeat for SNP traditionalists</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The vote was very close, close enough in fact to stir talk of mutiny and schisms in most other parties but alas this is the SNP and the truth is that the true nationalists, the genuine independence fighters, have been dying the death of a thousand cuts for 10/15 years now. Today was their last hurrah, they will hang about for some time to come and we will hear the sporadic death rattle but nothing more.</p> <p>Many old timers in the hall and sprinkled around the country will have had tears in their eyes as they stood looking at the triumphant platform and they could not miss surely that the platform was smirking at them. </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.44am: <strong>Fiona Hyslop</strong>, the Scottish culture secretary, is addressing the conference now. The party have released some extracts from her speech. She is saying the SNP believe in subsidising the arts because \"self-expression of the nation needs self-expression of its people\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Scotland's culture is our soul - in its traditions, in its innovation, ideas, debates, disputes, its many truths and its many questions. In its democratic intellect it does not just define us, it is constantly challenging and shaping and reshaping our perspective and ideas.</p> <p>Our artists need freedom, respect and support to do so unconditionally because it is in that atmosphere we will see our culture flourish still further.</p> <p>Conference in Scotland, we are seeing world class art, writing and performance being produced. Time and time again I am told from abroad we really value culture for what it is.</p> <p>I have worked hard to protect our cultural institutions and front line grants despite cuts that are too deep and too quick from Westminster. Where the Arts Council in England has seen cuts of 30% Scotland we have sought to protect culture.</p> <p>We believe in public subsidy of art and artists because we believe that self-expression of the nation needs self-expression of its peoples. The experience of one of us can speak to all, and to an audience across the globe.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>11.08am: The conference has passed a motion on welfare describing the UK government's plan to cut housing benefit for the under-25s as \"a shameful attack on young people\" and welcoming the Scottish government's guarantee that \"people will continue to receive the full pension and benefit payments that they are entitled to\" under independence.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.15am: Here's another blog about the SNP Nato vote yesterday that's worth reading.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://bothsidesthetweed.wordpress.com/2012/10/19/i-am-a-member-of-the-scottish-national-party/\">Alistair Cassidy on his Both Sides the Tweed blog says that the Nato debate should make people proud to belong to the SNP</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Essentially today the SNP moved from being anti-NATO to being NATO-sceptic. Because of a recognition of the importance of continuity and of mutual co-operation between nations and, in particular the nations of northern Europe NATO has been given a chance, a chance to prove itself as an organisation that can work in the interests of Scotland and of all its members.</p> <p>Be under no illusion that today was a significant day in the life of this party. As Kenny MacAskill put it we have moved from being a party of protest to a party of Government and today's debate exemplified that. Whatever the result had been the real winner today was party democracy and I believe that can be a real example to other political parties, both in Scotland and elsewhere and a sign to the people of Scotland of the kind of government that they should expect post-Independence.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>11.22am: The conference has just passed a motion on the NHS saying the SNP \"rejects all attempts to privatise any services provided by the NHS and congratulates the Scottish government on its commitment to keeping the Scottish NHS in the public sector, in contrast to the NHS in England.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.33am: <strong>Alyn Smith</strong> MEP has just opened a debate on the \"alternative economic model for Scotland that development trusts provide\". He said that if people were unhappy about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/poll/2012/oct/16/taxavoidance-starbucks\">Starbucks not paying much tax in the UK,</a> they should buy coffee from a local shop instead. Business \"rooted in the community\" understood the importance of paying tax, he said.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>12.09pm:<strong> Jill Evans</strong> MEP, the president of Plaid Cymru, has just finished addressing the conference. She was giving \"fraternal greetings\" on behalf of the Welsh nationalists. An independent Scotland would have not truer friend than Wales, she said.</p> <p>She also pointed out that in Plaid the president, chair, chief executive and leader are all women. I don't think she was trying to have a go at the SNP, but yesterday there were complaints about how few women were speaking in the Nato debate. \"The membership of the SNP is overwhelmingly male\", James Mitchell, Lynn Bennie and Rob Johns concluded <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Scottish-National-Party-Transition-Power/dp/0199580006\">in their study of the SNP published earlier this year.</a></p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.41pm: The cross-party campaign for a yes vote in the independence referendum is called Yes Scotland and it is being run by <strong>Blair Jenkins</strong>, a former head of news at STV and BBC Scotland who is not a member of the SNP, or any other party. He has just addressed the conference. It was an interesting speech, which included a very powerful argument for independence, although one that also undermined his separate argument about the yes campaign being beyond party politics. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Jenkins said independence campaigners should invite people to consider whether they would vote for union with England if Scotland were already independent.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think if you stand back and look at it, a campaign being run now to persuade Scotland to join the union in my view would be an impossible campaign to run. Just imagine some of the leading propositions, the case that would be put to the Scottish people: your main parliament will move hundreds of miles away, and your MPs will be in a tiny minority; you will get a government you didn't vote for; all your oil and gas revenues will be handed over to the London Treasury. The biggest nuclear weapons arsenal in Western Europe will be build on the River Clyde, 30 miles from your largest city. You will be joining a country where the health and education services are rapidly being privatised.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that Yes Scotland represented \"a new kind of politics\" because it was non-partisan and non-ideological.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As far as Yes Scotland is concerned, all we ask of anyone is that you support the core principle, the core democratic principle, that the best people to make decisions about the future of Scotland and what is right for Scotland are the who of Scotland themselves \u2026 That is the only price of admission if you like \u2026 This is a cause that transcends political parties and, indeed, is a new kind of politics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Theoretically, then, Yes Scotland is open not just to the SNP, but to people who want an independent Scotland to be an nuclear-armed, low-tax, minimum-regulation state - ie, like Texas, with mountains. But Jenkins undermined this point with his argument about imagining people being asked to vote for union with England (see above) and his claim that independence would allow Scotland to become more equal (see below).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said independence would allow Scotland to create a more equal society.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>We know that under successive Labour and Conservatives government, the UK has become one of the most unfair and unequal societies in the western world. That didn't happen as an act of God, it was an act of policy \u2026</p> <p>I believe 2014 will be the year of yes and we will get the majority we are looking for. We are coming to a clear fork in the road, a choice of direction. Let's not be part of an increasingly unequal society, let's continue on the journey we have started.</p> <p>The vision of an independent Scotland that many of us have is of a country where all of us look out for one another, and where our sense of duty and responsibility to other people don't begin and end at our own front door.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that Scotland had a \"strong collective ethos\" and that \"we do look out for one another and we do value one another\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Yes Scotland was attracting support from people from most parties. </strong>The Green would play \"a substantial role\" in the campaign, he said. The new group, Labour for Independence, was \"a growing and significant group\" within the party. And some notable figures in the Liberal Democrat party, like Dame Judy Steel, were now in favour of independence.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said all parties in Scotland should set out their vision for the future of the country, whether or not they supported independence.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the no campaign had a \"profoundly pessimistic\" view of Scotland's future.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The underlying rationale - the no narrative if you like - seems to be that the rest of the world, other countries in the world, and international institutions would adopt immediately an irrational and hostile view to an independent Scotland \u2026 I do not believe such a view has any rational or substantial basis at all.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said the no campaign would have difficulty attracting the support of 16 and 17-year-olds because they were opposed to under-18s getting the vote.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>You can imagine who the conversation would go: \"Hello, we're the no campaign. Remember us, we are the people who tried to stop you having a say in the future of your country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Yes Scotland's advisory board would ensure that the campaign represented all elements of Scottish life.</strong> The board is chaired by Dennis Canavan, the former Labour MP.<br><strong><br>\u2022 He said it was too early in the campaign to worry about the opinion polls.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that if every person in Scotland in favour of independence persuaded just one new person to vote yes, Yes Scotland would win.</strong></p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.45pm: It's not all good tempered at the SNP conference. My colleague Severin Carrell has sent me this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Scottish ministers confronted an angry and at times abusive crowd of anti-wind farm campaigners outside Scottish National party conference in Perth, with little love lost by either side.</p> <p>The crowd of perhaps 150 to 200 anti-wind farm activists \u2013 many dressed in tweeds, Barbour-style coats and Wellington boots - booed and hissed the Scottish health secretary Alex Neil as he walked past, with some in the crowd throwing v-signs and shouting \"no more turbines\".</p> <p>Stewart Stephenson, the former Scottish environment minister, and a champion of renewable technology, was booed too as he walked alongside the demonstration. He responded by pursing his lips and blowing \u2013 in imitation of the wind.</p> <p>With a mocked-up coffin and protestors dressed as undertakers, one banner hung over the barrier featured Alex Salmond raising two fingers in a victory salute, with the slogan: \"Two fingers to Aberdeenshire's landscape from the great windbag\".</p> <p>Salmond's proposals for a significant expansion of onshore windfarms \u2013 he wants the equivalent of 100% of Scotland's domestic electricity needs to be met from renewable sources \u2013 have met intense, vociferous criticism in the Scottish shires, and from some land conservation groups. One placard said: \"Highland landscapes are unique: don't sacrifice them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/severincarrell/status/259620517714202625\">a picture from Twitter.</a></p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>1.20pm: Here's a lunchtime summary.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Blair Jenkins, the head of the cross-party Yes Scotland campaign, has told SNP delegates to ignore the polls and to have faith that they can win the independence referendum.</strong> \"It is far too early in the campaign to be looking at opinion polls,\" he said, in the wake of evidence showing that support for independence has fallen this year. \"I believe we have the evidence. I believe we have the arguments. I believe we have the vision and the momentum.\" Jenkins also said that, if you framed the argument in terms of a question about whether an independent Scotland would vote now for a union with England (ie, if you turned the question inside out), it was impossible to imagine Scots voting for the union. See 12.41pm for a full summary.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>1.59pm: I'm still rounding up blog reaction to the Nato vote, and I've just found this: <a href=\"http://burdzeyeview.wordpress.com/2012/10/20/snp12-snippets/\">Burdz Eye View on her blog explaining why Alyn Smith's speech in the debate was a bit of a disaster.<br></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As for zeroes? Step forward Alyn Smith MEP. Apparently, he was a last minute addition to the speaker platform in the great NATO debate. That will be decision he might well live to regret. He achieved the remarkable feat of being heckled and boo-ed during his contribution, something I've never heard before at an SNP conference. Why? Because the gist of what he had to say was that important decisions on weighty matters like defence needed to be taken by \"professionals\" like him and that effectively, we delegates were too wee and too stoopit to know what we were doing. He also managed to give the meeja their quote of the day: apparently, the policy we had on defence, which had served us very well as a party since 2002 was \"hopelessly naive and idealistic and showed that Scotland wasn't ready for the big league\" . Not a good move for someone seeking re-selection as one of the party's European candidates in the near future.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>2.05pm: And Burdz Eye View has also got <a href=\"http://burdzeyeview.wordpress.com/2012/10/20/exclusive-jill-evans-mep-president-of-plaid-cymru-fraternal-address-to-conference/\">the full text of the speech from Jill Evans, the Plaid Cymru president.</a></p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>2.27pm: This is not strictly relevant to today's conference proceedings, but <a href=\" http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/10/19/dont-kid-yourself-scotland-you-still-need-the-bbc/\">Grainne Maguire's article for the Independent on what Scotland would be like without the BBC</a> is a good read.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes Scotland, after centuries of neglect, cultural condescension, not to mention The Highland clearances, you could finally sail your ship alone, but it would also mean missing out on Dr Who, so are you sure about this? As a child growing up in Ireland in the 1980s, I advise caution.</p> <p>Self determination is lovely but having to rely on a small, poorly-funded national broadcaster for your entertainment needs is cultural suicide. I speak from experience; Radio Telifis Eireann, the Irish National Television is, like most modest sized national broadcasters, unrelentingly, grindingly, auntie getting drunk and singing at a family wedding-awful. In my opinion it is every tedious, pointless, vaguely racist local newspaper put in motion. Scotland, imagine turning on your TV and discovering it was stuck on \"and now news from your area\" for all eternity and ask yourself if you really liked Braveheart that much?</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>2.34pm: Delegates have passed a resolution on international aid suggesting that independence would help Scotland meet the UN target for 0.7% of national wealth to go on aid spending. \"This 42-year-old target has been met by other small European nations such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Luxembourg, but not by the UK,\" it says.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>2.37pm: And delegates have also passed a resolution condemning the UK for having the seventh greatest income inequality in the OECD and saying that independence would allow the government to create a more equal society.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>2.42pm: <strong>Mark McDonald</strong> MSP has just finished doing the financial appeal. At the heart of it was a joke about trying to explain to his young child where babies came from. From mummy's tummy. And who put it there? Daddy. How? By magic. But how? The punchline involved the mummy saying, after the daddy has put the baby there, \"that was magic\".</p> <p>It worked better as he told it in the hall ...</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>2.55pm: <strong>Alex Salmond</strong> should be starting his speech within the next 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>3.07pm: Salmond is about to start. They are playing the stirring music.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>3.08pm: <strong>Nicola Sturgeon </strong>is introducing Alex Salmond.</p> <p>Salmond has been looking confident this week, she says. \"Isn't it nice to finally see him come out of his shell,\" she jokes. (Salmond is not known for being self-effacing.)</p> <p>In a few weeks time Salmond will become the longest-serving first minister.</p> <p>He is also Scotland's best ever first minister, she says.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>3.11pm: <strong>Alex Salmond</strong> is speaking now.</p> <p>He begins with a joke about George Osborne. He was on a train yesterday, he says.

  "<p>As sustainability finally starts to make an appearance on chief executives' agendas, and reluctant chief financial officers \u2013 hoping that some savings might be on the horizon \u2013 set aside funds for sustainability strategies, businesses face the perpetual hurdle of how to transform an elaborate strategy into a carbon-reducing reality. This is where employees come in.</p> <p>Employees are on the frontline of any business. Getting them to do something as simple as putting paper in a recycling bin all adds up when carbon emissions, waste, water consumption or energy use are concerned. But as businesses move beyond the basics, employers need a greater level of commitment from employees: why stop at switching lights off when you could be improving processes, innovating products, and generally making the workplace sustainable?</p> <p>Unfortunately, getting employees motivated by sustainability can prove just as challenging as getting the boardroom to sign off on a sustainability strategy. Why? Because many don't care, or have no idea why anyone's bothered about climate change in the first place. Or maybe they say they care, but don't find the time to change their routine. So when a business looks to take its sustainability strategy to the next level, engaging employees is crucial if it is to succeed.</p> <p>There's no single roadmap for engaging employees \u2013 different solutions work in different environments, companies have different cultures, and the maturity of the corporate sustainability strategy is also a determining factor \u2013 but plenty is already being done by businesses to get employees on board. These solutions can broadly be divided into four categories.</p> <h2>Strategy</h2> <p>The classic marketing tool of segmentation helps gauge specific groups' interest in sustainability and helps employers put the right sustainability message together for the right group. It also forces businesses to consider employees at both ends of the spectrum, whether they are super enthusiasts or sustainability cynics. Mitsubishi Electric UK used this method, and surveyed its staff to find out exactly what they thought about sustainability.</p> <p>And how do you engage groups of staff whose behaviour is difficult to change? Continuous targeting approaches deploy multiple tools until the best solution is found for the company. Environmental behaviour change charity <a href=\"http://globalactionplan.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Global Action Plan</a> uses surveys, focus groups and spot checks to choose the right interventions. This is part of a business case-led approach to close the gap between existing attitudes and target behaviour. The charity claims that a programme on flexible working behaviour saved one business 100,000 miles of commuting after just one month.</p> <p>Another approach is less about change, but more about business as usual. If sustainability is included as an integral part of an employees' job description, then employees are more likely to take responsibility for it. Lorry drivers at Boots UK, for example, proposed cutting carbon by sharing deliveries with drivers for other retail outlets.</p> <h2>Communications </h2> <p>Green teams are a regular feature in businesses' sustainability strategies. Volunteers take the lead, keeping tabs on office recycling or energy use, for example. But some firms, such as <a href=\"http://www.sapsustainabilityreport.com/\" title=\"\">SAP</a>, take this one step further: here managers let green team leaders dedicate 10% of their time to sustainability practices, while at accountancy firm, <a href=\"http://www.bdo.co.uk/\" title=\"\">BDO</a>, the green team seeks to extend engagement to include staff and their families.</p> <p>Volunteering is another approach. <a href=\"http://www.att.com/gen/landing-pages?pid=22872#s9-in-our-stores-&amp;-do-one-thing\" title=\"\">AT&amp;T launched Do One Thing</a> in 2011, giving employees the chance to make a small, individual choice that has a positive impact on their community and/or the firm. Paperless billing has increased since is introduction.</p> <p>Framing the conversation on sustainability pushes employers to think of questions that employees would really respond to. CA Technologies used this technique in its India office; after two weeks of messages framed in the context of food poverty, food wastage dropped by 75%.</p> <h2>Facilitation</h2> <p>The easier it is the more likely employees are to engage in sustainability strategies. Carpooling works when businesses have a high number of office staff. It's a growing tool for commuters: <a href=\"https://www.liftshare.com/uk/\" title=\"\">Liftshare.com</a>, for example, claims more than 500,000 members.</p> <p>Facilitating employee-led initiatives is another strategy, where firms offer employees funding for environmental projects. <a href=\"http://csr.bclcmaps.com/#!/projects/growing-algae-on-the-roof\" title=\"\">Intel's sustainability in action</a> grant scheme donated $125,000 (\u00a378,000) to nine projects in 2011, including the recycling of plastic reels from Intel's production line to create pencil boxes for local schools.</p> <h2>Employee motivation </h2> <p>Tapping into what motivates employees can help push sustainability strategies forward \u2013 as long as you find the right approach. Social media and game culture are two ways of encouraging employees to share progress and communication on sustainability.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cloudapps.com/sustainability-software-products/employee-engagement-sumo-new/\" title=\"\">CloudApps' SuMo software</a> incentivises employees to engage on sustainability, letting them share ideas, set challenges, and track personal performance on sustainability goals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wsppact.com/sites/pact/home.php\" title=\"\">WSP Environment &amp; Energy's Pact</a> works on similar principles. This online tool lets users set their personal carbon allowances, monitor their carbon and energy usage at home and on their way to work, and offers tips for best practice. WSP believes that employees who are more sustainable at home are most likely to continue these practices in their workplace.</p> <p>Ultimately, the challenge for businesses is finding ways to continuously re-engage employees on sustainability. Even the best planned strategies tend to lose their shine over time, and as they do, any energy, carbon or water efficiencies wane. But one thing is clear: without employees' engagement, sustainability strategies in the workplace will never succeed.</p> <p><em>Rodolphe d'Arjuzon, is global head of research for </em><a href=\"http://www.verdantix.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Verdantix</em></a><em>.

  "<p>A wealthy Vietnamese woman sits at a roadside cafe and prepares a dish for her own consumption. She is grinding up rhino horn. After a few minutes, water is added and she drinks the mixture out of a shot glass as a cure for her kidney stones. The woman paid several thousand US dollars for the piece of horn. The rhino died.</p> <p>The image is one of a series taken by <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/whats-on/temporary-exhibitions/wpy/photo.do?photo=2898&amp;category=58&amp;group=3\" title=\"\">South African photographer Brent Stirton, who won an award at the 2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition</a>, which opened at the Natural History Museum London on Friday. Entitled \"Deadly Medicine: Rhinos\", the six photographs in his award-winning portfolio depict the impact of poaching on the world, from game rangers in action to end users of rhino horn who believe it to be a medicine.</p> <p>Poaching has become a major part of organised global crime and so well organised that it threatens to wipe out some of the world's five remaining species of rhinos. Two of them, the Javan and the Sumatran, have been reduced to populations of only a few dozen each. Populations of the other three \u2013 black, white and one-horned rhinos \u2013 are also threatened.</p> <p>\"The illegal trade in wildlife is now the third largest criminal industry in the world and rhino poaching plays a key role,\" Stirton told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>\"It is driven by the growing affluence in Asian countries, particularly Vietnam and China, where people have believed for centuries that rhino horn can cure many illnesses, including cancer. The belief is part of their culture and deep rooted, and therefore very difficult to dislodge.\"</p> <p>The Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition is now in its 48th year and has earned a reputation for its superb images that glorify nature. However, new categories have been introduced in recent years to allow photographers to feature more uncomfortable truths about humanity's impact on the planet. One winner last year captured the devastating effect of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on wildlife, for example. This year's exhibition includes a chilling account of the plight of rhinos. Driven by soaring prices for rhino horn, the number of animals slaughtered has soared.</p> <p>In 2007 only 13 rhinos were killed by poachers; last year that figure rose to 448 \u2013 more than in any previous year. This year a total of 455 have been slaughtered so far, it was revealed last week by the government of South Africa, where 90% of all rhinos live. Most of these animals \u2013 272 of the 455 \u2013 were killed in the country's Kruger National Park and were white rhinos, the least threatened species. It is believed there are around 20,000 left in the wild.</p> <p>Stirton visited parks across South Africa to take his images, which include one of a vet's assistant holding up the horn of a tranquillised white rhino from a game farm outside Klerksdorp. Its horns have been removed to save it from poachers. \"Cutting off a horn can be an effective way of making a rhino safe from hunters,\" said Richard Sabin, a wildlife expert at the Natural History Museum. \"The animal no longer has value. On the other hand, a horn has only to grow back a few centimetres before it becomes lucrative enough to make it worthwhile for a poacher to go back and kill a rhino. That is a reflection of the enormous prices that rhino horn can now command.\"</p> <p>However, it is the image of the Vietnamese woman drinking rhino horn liquor that provides the most striking image in Stirton's portfolio. Her enjoyment at her task contrasts vividly with the blood shed to obtain that piece of horn. Getting the picture took considerable ingenuity.</p> <p>\"I posed as a Canadian who was trying to set up his own illegal market in my home country,\" said Stirton. \"I persuaded the dealer, who is in the background, to let me see someone preparing it so that I would know what to do to set up my own market when I got back to Canada. She is grinding the horn in a dish specially made for the purpose. It has a rhino symbol on the side and has a rough base on which to grind the horn into powder. After a few minutes, water was added and she swallowed it. The woman told me she took it daily for her general health. The interesting thing is that rhino horn is an illegal substance in Vietnam. But both the woman and her dealer had no fear of the police and happily ground the rhino horn in full view of the street. The dealer told me he paid $1,500 a month to the right people so he could sell rhino horn with impunity.\"</p> <p>The rising slaughter of the world's endangered rhinos is particularly ironic given the makeup of their horns, added Sabin. \"Their horns are made of keratin. That is the stuff from which hair, fingernails and toenails are made. In other words, chewing your own fingernails would do you as much as good as taking powdered rhino horn, and at least that would avoid the slaughter of rhinos.\"</p> <p><em>The Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year is at the Natural History Museum until 3 March 2013, before embarking on a global tour. </em></p>",
  "<p>As Republican challenger Mitt Romney addressed a throng of supporters in the Virginian town of Leesburg last week, he started to rattle through a list of campaign promises. \"When I become president\" he began. Then he paused and regarded the crowd for a moment before repeating the first word with extra emphasis. \"<em>When</em> I become president, we are finally going to cut spending,\" he said, to shouts of approval.</p> <p>It would have fallen flat just a few weeks ago. The former Massachusetts governor's campaign was emerging from a disastrous summer. It was firmly behind in the polls, had been savaged by an efficient Democrat attack machine and been hit by the release of a secret videotape revealing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/obama-campaign-fresh-attack-romney\" title=\"\">Romney dismissing 47% of Americans </a>as dependent on government. Many observers, including some panicking Republicans, were writing him off as a rightwing version of Michael Dukakis, another former Massachusetts governor, who was soundly beaten by George Bush in 1988.</p> <p>But that was then. In Leesburg, Romney appeared relaxed and confident, cracking jokes and launching attacks against President Barack Obama's economic record. He turned on the charm, too. \"There is so much about this country I love,\" he gushed, before reciting a litany of inspiring anecdotes collected from his many months on the campaign trail. \"We are going to win Virginia, you know that? We are going to win,\" he said.</p> <p>He has grounds for optimism. After Obama's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate \u2013 and Romney's solid, warm showing \u2013 the 2012 election has upended itself. For two weeks a flood of polls has detailed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/08/romney-gains-lead-obama-poll\" title=\"\">a surge in Romney's support</a>. A Gallup tracking survey has him seven points in the lead nationally, beating Obama by 52% to 45%. In the key battlegrounds of Virginia and Florida, Romney is back in the game. He is closing the gap in Wisconsin, which many had seen as out of reach. Even in Pennsylvania, which no one had seen as up for grabs, one recent poll had him ahead. In North Carolina, which narrowly went for Obama in 2008, Romney's team is now so confident of victory that it has started moving out staff and redeploying them to Ohio.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398115699\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/21/1350780966864/US-key-election-battlegro-001.jpg\" alt=\"US key election battlegrounds\" width=\"460\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US key election battlegrounds.

It is hammering away at the issue of Obama's economic record, ignoring signs of a gradual recovery and instead repeatedly referring to high unemployment, millions of people on food stamps and growing poverty. It is a message that strikes a chord with many people still suffering from the impact of the recession.</p> <p>Certainly in the Leesburg crowd no one was talking about good times being ahead. \"He was a governor of a Democratic state and if he was able to get things done there, then he could get things done anywhere. He should be able to make things happen on a national scale,\" said Diane Senyitko, 52, whose construction business has been hit hard for more than five years of economic turmoil.</p> <p>\"Obama already had his chance. If he was going to bring about a recovery, it would have happened already,\" she said. Indeed, Senyitko is now campaigning for Romney, knocking on doors all over Leesburg and trying to win people over. \"I see a lot of enthusiasm that I did not see before. I don't even think it will be neck and neck at the end. It will be a big win,\" she said.</p> <p>That is probably unlikely. Obama is still \u2013 when all the polls are taken into consideration \u2013 likely to be narrowly ahead. But the race has certainly shifted and the prospect of a Romney win has gone from a poor joke to a perfectly realistic prospect. \"The chances that Romney will win have gotten a lot better,\" said Professor Kevin Leicht, a political expert at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Now stories of internal dissent within the Romney camp have been replaced with accounts of a \"happy warrior\" candidate, comfortable at the end of an almost six-year quest to get to the White House. Party bigwigs \u2013 once critical of his campaign \u2013 have lined up loyally behind him. So have evangelical leaders, who privately remain sceptical because he is a Mormon. Media critics have fallen silent. Even Karl Rove, President George W. Bush's old guru, has been speculating enthusiastically on Romney's chances of winning the White House back for a party that in 2008 was seen as headed for a lengthy period in the wilderness. Already some have begun to speculate on what that would mean for America and the rest of the world. \"He will run this country like the chief executive of a large corporation,\" said Steven Mitchell, a Republican pollster and founder of Mitchell Research.</p> <p>What you think of that prospect depends on your politics. Liberals would see such a thing as a return to the worst excesses from before the recession. Romney has pledged to deregulate Wall Street again and lower corporate taxes. He preaches the sort of \"trickle down\" economics of the 1980s that Ronald Reagan did, glorifying the wealthy and seeing tax breaks for them as having a broader economic benefit.</p> <p>He wants to scrap Obama's healthcare reforms and take an axe to every part of government, except the military. Liberals fear all this will make America even more unequal, risk another financial meltdown and hurt the lowest levels of society for whom federal help is vital.</p> <p>They also worry Romney will be beholden to the desires of the broader Republican party, especially in Congress, which, stuffed with Tea Party zealots and social conservatives, is far more rightwing than his presidential campaign. They worry the party will force Romney to extremes on everything from monetary policy to abortion, immigration and gay rights. \"They have already influenced Romney in unfavourable ways. The prospects of going back to a pre-2008 environment are very real,\" said Leicht, referring to the extreme stances Romney adopted in order to win his party's nomination.</p> <p>Republicans, obviously, see it differently. They see Romney as unshackling business, sparking broader economic growth and cutting out unnecessary spending that will reduce the deficit. They see Romney rescuing America from the fate of Greece and other heavily indebted European nations. \"There will be a sea change from the current administration. People will invest in things again,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>It might not be so easy, though. As Obama has found, America's system of government appears designed to end in deadlock. Republican intransigence stymied much of Obama's own domestic agenda. There is little reason to think Romney will fare any better if Democrats still control either part of Congress. Even with \"Obamacare\", Romney might not actually be able to fulfil his party's dreams by scrapping it altogether. \"You can't just repeal it and not replace it with anything,\" said Leicht. Indeed much of Obamacare was based on Romney's own health reforms in Massachusetts. Such \"flip flops\" have long marked his political career and that makes predicting a Romney first term especially difficult: it has never been clear what his core beliefs are. \"In the short term it is going to be hard for him to do very much at all. America's problems are actually too big for either candidate to solve easily,\" Leicht said.</p> <p>Of course there is still a long way to go. Though the Obama campaign has been rocked by the sudden upturn in Romney's fortunes, it remains on top of the race overall. Aside from Gallup, other polls have Obama narrowly ahead or statistically tied at a national level. More important are surveys coming out of the swing states which show Obama still ahead, especially in the midwestern heartland of Ohio.</p> <p>Among all the battlegrounds, it is Ohio that is most important. No Republican has ever won the White House without also winning Ohio and Obama is still solidly ahead there. Obama's operation in the state is huge and well-funded. Both Obama and the first lady have been regular visitors: his entire re-election campaign was launched in the state capital of Columbus. Bill Clinton has been touring the state. Even Bruce Springsteen has been deployed there. If Romney's advance can be stopped in Ohio, the main Democratic campaign argument runs, then it will be halted everywhere. But, essentially, the race for the Oval Office is now on a knife edge.</p> <p>Only a few milestones remain, chief of which is Monday night's third and final debate in Florida. Yet, with its topic of foreign policy, that is unlikely to prove too much of a game-changer given that the electorate's overriding concern is jobs and the economy. \"Honestly, put a gun to my head right now and ask me to pick a winner? I just don't know,\" said Mitchell.</p> <p>But in Leesburg they think they do. Around 8,000 people gathered to hear Romney speak in a park, enjoying the last warm days of autumn. After so much time campaigning and wooing the different camps of his party, Romney appeared to have finally stitched it all together behind him.</p> <p>Take local IT specialist Matthew Russell, 49. He had begun supporting pizza magnate Herman Cain during the party's bitter nomination race, then favoured former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"Romney was my last choice,\" he confessed. But he was OK with things now, because Romney was offering the one thing that really does unite the party: he might beat Obama. \"If the election was held tomorrow, then I think it would be Obama to win, but if the momentum keeps up this way then I think Romney will eke it out in November,\" he said.</p> <p>If Romney does win, it will not have been pretty. The 2012 election has seen Obama launch one of the most negative campaigns in recent memory claiming Romney is a heartless plutocrat who wants to take America back to the post civil war era satirised by Mark Twain as the Gilded Age. In response, Romney has painted Obama as a dangerous pseudo-socialist taking America on the path to ruin. But if, come 6 November, it is Romney who emerges victorious then neither he nor anyone else in his party will care. In Leesburg, Romney ended his speech with a rousing call to arms. \"We are taking back America,\" he told the crowd. \"America is coming back, we are going to have a real recovery.\"</p> <p>Watching the speech was estate agent Kim Levy, 38. She has been ignoring the polls in favour of a less scientific study of support. The local 7-11 convenience stores have been running a promotion whereby cups of soda feature a picture of Romney or Obama. \"All the Romney cups are gone and all the Obama ones are still there, except maybe one. It's like that at all the 7-11s in Leesburg. All of them,\" she said with undisguised glee.</p>",
  "<p>Scores of Travellers removed from the Dale Farm site near Basildon in Essex 12 months ago have suffered mental or physical illness after being forced to live in \"squalor\" following the controversial eviction, according to a report by MPs.</p> <p>The report into the living conditions of those forced from the Essex plot during the \u00a37.2m eviction operation found that many have reported health complaints due to unhygienic and unsuitable living conditions. It expressed concern that families who had moved to a nearby plot had no access to toilets. Some even had no electricity and sanitation was judged to be poor.</p> <p>As a result, the Dale Farm plot is now rat-infested and covered with human excrement, posing a further health hazard. Impetigo, chickenpox and diarrhoea have swept through the encampment, with children affected by vomiting bouts. Residents say many of the women at Dale Farm were prescribed antidepressants before the eviction and, more than a year later, are still on them.</p> <p>Following a site visit last month by the all-party parliamentary group for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers, MPs say that the health of former Dale Farm residents has deteriorated due to the conditions they have experienced since the eviction. It said: \"The delegation found that many of the residents are highly vulnerable and have serious conditions such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, osteoporosis, Crohn's disease, bowel cancer, Down's syndrome etc.</p> <p>\"Members of the Red Cross again stated their continued concerns regarding the physical and mental health of the Travellers, lack of sanitation and the possible health threats posed by the evicted site.\"</p> <p>The report said that mothers and young children were particularly vulnerable, with one baby born at the roadside encampment two weeks ago and consternation that midwife visits to women living on the temporary site were suspended for eight months.</p> <p>Another longer-term health concern follows growing fears that the Environment Agency may have found asbestos on the site. Documents seen by the <em>Observer</em> reveal that soil exhibits taken by Environment Agency officials from Dale Farm plots were recorded as having \"suspected asbestos\".</p> <p>The Environment Agency report on whether the eviction uncovered pollutants is expected at the end of the month. Many residents, according to the Gypsy Council, are on repeat courses of antibiotics for chest infections.</p> <p>Of the 86 families who lived on the Dale Farm site, a largely illegal settlement, around 20 have moved to the temporary camp on a private access road just 100 metres away. A further 20 live nearby on a legal site, while another 20 are travelling in two convoys around the Midlands, where they are frequently moved on by the authorities. The remainder have found accommodation at a caravan site at Fen, Leighton Buzzard, in Bedfordshire, where last year police rescued 24 modern-day slaves from bondage and \"filthy and cramped\" conditions.</p> <p>Many of the men have opted to work abroad, leaving women alone to cope with the unsuitable conditions for long periods.</p> <p>Those who remain at the temporary camp on the roadside near Dale Farm say they have endured psychological anguish since losing their homes. Patrick Egan, who has been unable to work since falling into a ditch on the Dale Farm camp and breaking his ankle, admits he is among those who has sought psychiatric help. He said: \"It has got to me.\"</p> <p>Despite complaints from nearby villagers that the eviction did little to improve the area, Tony Ball, leader of Basildon council, maintains that the site clearance was not a failure. He said: \"The objective of the site clearance was to remedy the illegal development in the area, and this objective was achieved. Clearly, we still have an issue with Travellers living on the Oak Lane roadside who should not be there.\"</p> <p>David McPherson-Davis, a parish councillor for the area, is pleased to see at least some of the Travellers go. \"Personally I feel the site clearance was good value for money. If it hadn't happened it would have created a precedent for Irish Travellers to occupy land and develop it without any concern for local inhabitants.\"</p> <p>Those Travellers living on the roadside have been served with enforcement notices to leave.</p>",

Rural communities might have greater challenges than cities with regard to transport and access to services but on the other hand there might be stronger social networks and support provided in the community that can help adapt to some of these local challenges.</p> <p><strong>Small solutions can make a big difference:</strong> Lack of public toilets is often mentioned as a key barrier to social participation in consultations with older people. New York City is running an <a href=\"http://www.nyam.org/agefriendlynyc/initiatives/current/age-friendly-business.html\" title=\"\">age-friendly business project</a> where participating local businesses give access to their toilets to older people, as well as providing chairs to rest.</p> <h2><strong>Rachel Lee is policy and research coordinator for </strong><a href=\"http://www.livingstreets.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Living Streets</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>What is an age-friendly city?</strong> One that enables older people to remain active and engaged within their communities. Our streets should be welcoming places that are accessible for everyone. For older people that means well maintained pavements to avoid trip hazards, cleanliness, seating, provision of public toilets, local access to a range of local services (health, shopping, banks) and more.</p> <p><strong>There is a clear urban-rural divide:</strong> Most of us depend on the convenience and accessibility afforded by the car. Then one day, we can't drive anymore. In fact, the more difficulty people have getting around on foot, the more likely it is that they rely on walking as their main means of transport. Transport and car dependent lifestyles are key here. Rural areas not only rely on private transport more, but many people also commute to work. The ideal situation where older people have family living around them to offer support is also fast changing as people move to where the work is.</p> <h2><strong>Janet Dean is co-author of </strong><a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/creating-dementia-friendly-york\" title=\"\"><strong>Creating a Dementia-Friendly York</strong></a><strong>, a </strong><a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Joseph Rowntree Foundation</strong></a><strong> report</strong></h2> <p><strong>It is about more than the physical environment:</strong> The four cornerstones we identified for a dementia-friendly community, which I think will apply to age generally, are: place, including environment, housing and transport); people, including the social attitudes of the community generally and how people close to you treat you; resource, not just health and social care services but shops, leisure, faith resources; and networks \u2013 how people work together to support older people both nationally and locally.</p> <p><strong>Age-friendly does not mean unfriendly to other ages:</strong> Our research identified place as one of four cornerstones which might enable dementia-friendly cities. However, we found that many of the aspects of place which are good for people with dementia \u2013 a legible environment, clear signage, green spaces, manageable housing, reliable public transport with patient drivers \u2013 are good for everybody, whatever our age and our abilities.</p> <p><strong>Partnership between local authorities and community groups: </strong>What was really clear during a recent walkabout in Sheffield was the lack of collaboration and co-ordination between planners, transport planners, highways engineers and the community. Attempts to deal with parking on verges and joyriding had left the area peppered with bollards and a patchwork of coloured parking bays and red zones on the roads which we didn't really understand. Kerbs were dropped but mostly on three sides of a cross road, meaning you had to go a very long way round to cross the main road.</p> <p><strong>Stops and signs:</strong> Tactile paving at bus stops and crossing points are inconsistent as fashions and standards seem to change. The clearest signs are the original black on white road names fixed high up on houses. Community engagement schemes have produced a plethora of different styles of signage from brightly coloured totem poles to wood and steel structures. While decorative and fun, none of these are readable from across the road.</p> <h2><strong>Paul McGarry has led Manchester council's </strong><a href=\"http://www.manchester.gov.uk/info/500099/valuing_older_people/3428/valuing_older_people_vop/1\" title=\"\"><strong>Valuing Older People</strong></a><strong> programme since 2003</strong></h2> <p><strong>'Dementia-friendly' is best seen as a dimension of age-friendly:</strong> I'm less convinced that dementia-friendly is any better defined than age-friendly though, and certainly an exclusive focus on dementia can lead to missing out wider community forces that can be harnessed, and there is a risk that older age becomes equated with dementia.</p> <h2><strong>Professor June Andrews is director of the </strong><a href=\"http://dementia.stir.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>dementia services development centre</strong></a><strong> at the University of Stirling</strong></h2> <p><strong>Better education for staff: </strong>Our research has shown in the past that even social and health care professionals do not get much education about how to care for people with dementia. So if we are thinking of having towns and cities where older people who are vulnerable are supported by the community, we need to be aware that the community cannot always rely on professional staff understanding their needs.</p> <p><strong>Diagnosing dementia:</strong> Research shows that many GPs tend to ignore dementia, rather than seeking a diagnosis, because they think that there is not much you can do, so in some parts of England only 30% of the people with dementia have been advised that this is their problem. In these areas many local services are working in the dark, unable to give the full range of support \u2013 and this includes police, libraries and leisure facilities, not just social workers.</p> <p><strong>Community involvement in design can be a help and a hinderance:</strong> I get frustrated when I ask architects why they have incorporated a not very dementia friendly idea and they say it was a result of a focus group or a public consultation. Involvement is all very well, but they don't have focus groups about plumbing or load bearing walls, so why do they do it with other important elements for which there is already research evidence and, in some cases, regulation?</p> <h2><strong>Greg Lewis is </strong><a href=\"http://www.ageuk.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Age UK's</strong></a><strong> programme manager for communities and society</strong></h2> <p><strong>People age quicker in rural areas:</strong> The needs of older people should be a priority in rural proofing policy and services. Decisions made by all levels of government to fund services in rural areas cannot be based simply on cost and the number of people using the service; rather, a broader impact assessment needs to be carried out taking into account social impact.</p> <h2><strong>Simon Peyton is </strong><a href=\"http://www.anchor.org.uk/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\"><strong>Anchor's</strong></a><strong> public affairs manager </strong></h2> <p><strong>Do we need a minister for older people?</strong> Wales has taken huge steps forward and I wonder if this is because they have a cabinet member with the responsibility for older people's issues.
