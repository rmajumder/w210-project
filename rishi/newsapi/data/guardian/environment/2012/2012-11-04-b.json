  "<p>According <a href=\"http://www.cellular-news.com/story/34051.php\" title=\"\">to AT&amp;T</a>, 40% of texters who are dating believe that text messaging plays a significant role in their relationship. This may be of scant consolation to David Cameron who has been trying unsuccessfully to bury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/nov/04/david-cameron-texts-rebekah-brooks\" title=\"\">a cache of texts</a> between Downing Street and the former News International chief Rebekah Brooks. But of all the boons of the internet age, SMS messages may well turn out to be the most far reaching. They are a more instant form of public service announcement than radio. Governments use SMS alerts in times of crisis to warn people of floods and earthquakes. Their social impact has been truly global. A text message campaign in Africa that exposed which countries ran out of essential medicines embarrassed national governments into action. Texts are both personal and non-intrusive. When handed to the likes of Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry, texts may, however, lose some of their initial intimacy.</p>",
  "<p>I seem to be finding it harder to get over the death of Sybil than everyone at <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/downtonabbey/\" title=\"\"><strong>Downton Abbey</strong></a> (ITV1, Sunday) is. Well, they've got other things to worry about \u2013 such as the snowballing momentum of social change. It was so much easier when upstairs meant upstairs and downstairs meant downstairs; but now there are all these landings and mezzanines, people barging their way upwards, others sliding down, or being pushed down, it's like a game of snakes and bloody ladders. Mrs O'Brien is chief snake obviously. Sssss.</p> <p>Then you've got women \u2013 the few who haven't died during childbirth \u2013 wanting to vote. And work. And \u2013 huh! \u2013 write newspaper columns. (I do like the way that went in those days though; when I've finished this, I'm going to take the train up to London, to discuss my copy with my editor, then maybe we'll go out for dinner ... well I would if I wasn't already in London, in the office, and my editor didn't have about 17 other columns to deal with.)</p> <p>Jazz has arrived, at The Blue Dragon club in Soho. \"It's like the outer circle from Dante's Inferno,\" says Matthew on entering. Not a jazz man then. Nor am I, to be honest, but in 1920 it must have felt as if a window had finally been opened and a blast of fresh air let in to the stifling stuffiness of it all. Matthew's just boring.</p> <p>And there's this other new plague, homosexuality, which Thomas probably caught during the war, off a Frenchman. It's obviously foul and unnatural and ungodly etc, but there's also a new kind of tolerance creeping in (probably from France as well). As Lord Grantham \u2013 or Robert, as he's increasingly known as \u2013 says, everyone at Eton is at it, so maybe it's not such a big deal after all.</p> <p>Mrs O'Brien, flicking her forked tongue in and out, isn't feeling any of this new tolerance though, and it's not looking good for Thomas, who could well end up in Reading jail. Until Bates comes to the rescue. Urrgh, Bates, I think I'm even less over his release from prison than I am over Sybil's death. They should have hanged him when they had the chance. I don't care if he was innocent. At least O'Brien is a&#xa0;snake. Bates is a snivelling, sanctimonious little worm of a man.</p> <p>To be fair, he does save the day, and Thomas, simply by whispering three words \u2013 \"her ladyship's soap\" \u2013 in O'Brien's ear. It's blackmail \u2013 he's referring to the time she made Lady Grantham slip getting out of the bath, slip and miscarry, remember? It's a double entendre though, he's also (unknowingly perhaps) referring to Downton Abbey itself, the programme in which he appears. Downton is her ladyship's soap, Emmerdale with a posh frock on. This series has reached new heights of melodrama, absurdity of storyline and cliched writing. And at times \u2013 say some people who know more about these things than I do \u2013 just plain wrongness. Would Lord Grantham really have called someone \"a big girl's blouse\" in 1920? (I'm not too fussed about that, actually, but it gets other people's goats). Downton is still undeniably fun, just so long as you&#xa0;realise that's all it is \u2013 fun \u2013 and nothing more.</p> <p>Right then, to the village green for the annual cricket match. \"S'up bro,\" Lord Grantham greets the opposing captain ... ha, only kidding. The cricket is splendid, Thomas plays brilliantly, hits boundary after boundary, in spite of his gayness. Tolerance wins the match, and the day. And the covers come over for the season.</p> <p>For the next series, I'd like to see a bigger leap forward in time, around 92 years, say, to the present. So this lot will just be portraits on the staircase, except most of them will have had to be sold, to pay off debts. Lord Grantham will be the son that Matthew and Mary haven't yet conceived, but by then will be an old man in a baseball cap rattling around in the crumbling remains of the house. There'll be film crews there, from Channel 4 probably, rescuing the house, searching for antiques to sell, making a fly-on-the wall documentary about an endangered species (the English aristocracy, who by then \u2013 now \u2013 will be nothing more than a source of entertainment for the rest of us). Yes, I think that works. And it will be like a whole new genre of TV \u2013 documentary, and docudrama, within drama (well, soap opera then).</p> <p>And television won't just have eaten itself, it too will have entered at least the first circle of Dante's Inferno.</p>",

I was in Atlanta, Georgia that day and I remember the line snaking right round the school where the polling station was set up; on and on it went. This year I truly didn't expect to see anything nearly as impressive, what with the mood of the country being so sour and the economy still so sluggish. But I've just seen one of the longest lines I've ever seen at the polling station in downtown Cleveland. It was so long it went round the block and around another block. I walked all the way along it and counted my steps \u2013 400 full paces of voters queuing up dutifully in the cold to cast their ballot. You'd have to be pretty cynical not to find that impressive.</p> <p>The line is 90% African American, I'd say, and every one of the people I spoke to were intending to vote for Barack Obama. This is Souls to the Polls day when black churches encourage their congregation from all over the city to come to the polling station and vote. I've come down here with a black church from the suburbs, God's Tabernacle of Faith. Pastor Thomas Eppinger finished his Sunday service, then piled his congregants into two vans and brought them to the polling station.</p> <p>It takes some determination on a cold day like this to join the very back of the queue. But that is what Barbara Dixon, 39, had just done when I spoke to her just now. She said she was happy to wait \"as long as it takes because I want to make sure this election is won by a president who has values that I care about\". She's got at least two hours to go before she gets to the voting booth, but really she didn't seem at all bothered.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dd51ea76-1ff1-4d58-8dfd-c591cc8ca906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352064233397/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"voters queue in Cleveland, Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Cleveland, Ohio, waited in long queues to cast early votes.

Saturday night was bitterly cold in Bristow, Virginia, but that didn\u2019t stop thousands coming to a rally addressed by the two best orators their party has produced since Robert Kennedy. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d Jennifer Rodriguez, a nurse who\u2019d made the journey from Richmond, told me.</p> <p>Of course Bill Clinton has to play the support act these days, but he does so with huge heart. He bounded on stage in brown leather bomber jacket, wrapped up far less warmly than his audience, and delivered what was largely a reprise of his Charlotte showstopper, when he wowed the Democratic convention with a masterclass in substantive rhetoric, patiently laying out the policy-based reasons why the American people should re-elect their president. His voice was so hoarse, you wondered if it would give out. But the crowd stayed with him, lapping up the unarguable simplicity of lines such as \u201c\u2019We\u2019re all in this together\u2019 is better than \u2018you\u2019re on your own.\u2019\u201d And he can still work a rally like the most seasoned Catskills comic. Of Mitt Romney\u2019s multiple positions on the auto-bailout, Clinton said: \"He\u2019s tied himself up in so many knots, he could be hired as the chief contortionist of Cirque du Soleil.\u201d</p> <p>There were two moments of almost imperceptible tension. One came early, when Clinton confessed himself \u201cmore excited\u201d about supporting Barack Obama \u201ceven than I was four years ago.\u201d It brought a fleeting reminder that in early 2008, Bill Clinton was devoting all his red-faced energy to dismissing the Obama candidacy as a \u201cfairytale.\u201d Later the former president spoke of the ailment known as Romnesia, the habit of forgetting the Republican\u2019s past record. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard him add, as an aside, that \u201cHis opponent may even have got a bit of it.\u201d That sounded like a reference to Obama himself, an apparent dig at the president\u2019s failure, especially in the first debate, to nail Romney\u2019s many contradictions.</p> <p>If that's what it was, few noticed it. Instead, the crowd cheered for Obama when he come on to high-five and hug his predecessor - and cheered louder as he delivered a strong, confident and, at times, stirring performance. He lavished praise on Clinton, saying his team \u201ccalls him the Secretary of Explaining Stuff\u201d. He added that \u201cthe only person working harder than he is is Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>When the speeches were over, the two men worked the ropeline together to the sound of Clinton\u2019s old anthem, Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow. Yesterday the Clintons were Obama\u2019s foes. Today they are two of his most useful friends.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4904d4d3-5714-4a5d-998e-7e76eee714bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352038483183/f647848e-9104-48a6-b46d-7885295c6730-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Virginia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at their joint appearance in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night.

  "<p>Poor sleep \u2013 as anyone who suffers from it knows \u2013 can make life a misery. And it is&#xa0;taking its toll on the nation's health. According to the recently published <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishsleepsurvey.com/2012report/\" title=\"\">Great British Sleep Survey</a>, more than 51% of us now struggle to get a good night's sleep, with women three times more likely to be affected than men.</p> <p>Evidence collected from 20,000-plus adults between March 2010 and this June shows that 93% of insomniacs report low energy levels and 83% complain of mood swings. Some 77% find it hard to concentrate, 64% say they are less productive at work, and 55% report relationship difficulties.</p> <p>Even worse, persistent poor sleep can increase the risk of developing conditions including diabetes, depression, high blood pressure and strokes. Research at the University of British Columbia suggests every hour of sleep lost at night <a href=\"http://liferesolutionsaustralia.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/how-sleep-loss-is-making-you-dumber/\" title=\"\">may cost us one IQ point the following day</a>. And it is often a long-term issue: a quarter of people with insomnia have suffered from it for more than 10 years.</p> <p>In Britain, overwhelmingly, we treat poor sleep with medication: the NHS spent a staggering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/20/sleeping-pills-britains-hidden-addiction\" title=\"\">\u00a350m on sleeping pills last year</a>, with 15.3m prescriptions dispensed across England, Scotland and Wales (up 17% in three years). But many pills have undesirable side-effects and the survey's findings suggest they do not solve long-term sleep problems: 42% of people who have taken them on and off have continued to have poor sleep for more than a decade.</p> <p>So how can we do something about poor sleep without pills? Most people focus first on what Colin Espie, professor of clinical psychology and director of the <a href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/glasgowsleepcentre/\" title=\"\">University of Glasgow Sleep Centre</a>, calls \"sleep hygiene\": our pre-bed routine, and the physical environment in which we try to sleep. Espie believes these factors account for a mere 10% of sleep problems: \"most people with insomnia have better sleep hygiene than easy sleepers\". But most sleep experts concur that the following do make a difference.</p> <p><strong>Light.</strong> A dark room is important to a good sleep. Also try to avoid \"blue light\" less than two hours before bed: research by the Lighting Research Centre at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York State suggests light from laptop, tablet and smartphone screens <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9533249/Using-iPads-before-bed-can-lead-to-a-poor-nights-sleep.html\" title=\"\">tricks us into thinking it is daytime and keeps us alert</a>, although this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/reality-check/2012/sep/11/can-tablet-screens-disrupt-sleep\" title=\"\">has been disputed</a>. Bedrooms should be a comfortable temperature (around 18C), quiet and well-ventilated, with comfortable beds and pillows</p> <p><strong>Food, drink, exercise.</strong> Anything that stimulates the system \u2013 such as caffeine (although some experimental studies show a cup of coffee may lengthen the time taken to drop off by just three minutes), alcohol, chocolate, tobacco, a heavy meal or strenuous exercise \u2013 will make it harder to get to sleep. Indigestible foods are obviously best avoided; carbohydrates can promote serotonin, which aids sleep. Aim for a regular, balanced diet and no late-night excess. Twenty minutes a day of exercise will make a big difference to your sleep, but avoid it just before bed.</p> <p><strong>Sleep debt.</strong> A weekend lie-in or afternoon snooze can do more harm than good. According to research at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre, \"sleep debt\" is best \"repaid\" by <a href=\"http://www.medicaldaily.com/articles/12040/20120911/sleeping-weekends-makes-sleepier-during-week.htm\" title=\"\">getting up and going to bed at your normal times</a> rather than disrupting your body clock. Save sleep for bedtime: naps are recommended only if you are too exhausted to function.</p> <p><strong>Age.</strong> Not strictly sleep hygiene, and not much you can do about it either, but it may help to know that it can get harder to sleep as you get older. Research by the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Centre and others has shown our \"sleep architecture\" changes as we age: older people spend less time in deeper, non-REM sleep, and their whole body clock or circadian rhythm moves forward.</p> <p>\"Sleep hygiene\" alone, however, will not determine whether or not we sleep well. Ninety per cent of the battle is in&#xa0;the mind, which is why talking therapies and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are coming to be seen as perhaps the most useful solution. Espie helped launch <a href=\"http://www.sleepio.com/about/\" title=\"\">Sleepio</a>, a pioneering online CBT programme that&#xa0;has won praise from the medical press, including the Lancet and the peer-reviewed journal Sleep. In a full clinical trial, it helped 75% of people with long-term poor sleep.</p> <p>So, get your head right, and you will&#xa0;usually sleep. But how? These are Espie's top tips:</p> <h2><strong>Pillow talk</strong></h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> Recognise that \"sleep is not a lifestyle choice, it is a biological inevitability. It is very, very powerful, and we need to get it working for us: a&#xa0;person not sleeping well has first and foremost to allow sleep to do its work. Sleep is a process of letting go.\"</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Sleep's achilles heel, however, \"is our world. Most sleep problems are psychological obstacles that we put in sleep's way. Like all things we should do automatically, when we deliberately try to do them we screw up. Adopt a relaxed, confident approach to sleep, not a neurotic, panic-stricken one. Recognise there's a right and a wrong kind of effort. Your role model is the 'careless sleeper'.\"</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Go to sleep only when you feel sleepy and, if anything, shorten the time you try to sleep: \"A lot of people put good sleep beyond the achievable simply because they are so worried about not sleeping. Their sleep becomes frayed, even more broken. If I try to read a book in bed, it's never very successful because I go to bed when I'm ready to sleep. It's counter-intuitive, but a shorter sleep often means a better quality of sleep.\"</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Put the day to bed long before putting yourself to bed. \"A racing mind \u2013 what happened today, what's on tomorrow, what will the future hold? \u2013 is a huge obstacle to sleep. So take time before bed: go through the day, think about tomorrow, put things in their boxes, make a list. Set your mind at rest.\"</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Learn to value relaxation, and if necessary learn specific relaxation techniques. Above all, \"Don't try too hard.\" But, of course, for some that is easier said than done.</p> <p><em>For more information about Sleepio, visit </em><a href=\"http://www.sleepio.com/\" title=\"\"><em>sleepio.com</em></a></p> <p><em>\u2022 Do you suffer from insomnia?

  "<p>The UK boasts several internationally significant populations of ash that require the highest levels of protection. These will be lost if we do not urgently target resources to these areas to try to at least slow progress of the ash dieback disease (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/ash-tree-disease-10-years\" title=\"\">Most UK ash trees will be diseased 'within 10 years'</a>, 3 November).</p> <p>Top of the list must be those in the Lake District, which includes significant numbers of ash in ancient semi-natural woodlands and many hundreds of ancient pollards. Pollarding (lopping branches off trees at a height of 3-4m above ground on a regular cycle) is integral to the silvopastoral system practiced for centuries in the region.</p> <p>In valleys such as Borrowdale there are specimens many hundreds of years old which provide vital habitat for rare lichens, birds, bats and invertebrates. They are as much part of the landscape as the lakes, Herdwick sheep and vernacular architecture.</p> <p>Our experience with dutch elm disease, foot and mouth and red squirrel conservation, tells us that core populations need to be identified for disease exclusion. We must apply the lessons of history and urgently direct resources to our most valuable ash populations. <br><strong>Edward R Wilson</strong> <br><em>Penrith, Cumbria</em></p> <p>\u2022 On Radio 4 it was reported that Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, has said there was no delay in implementing precautions to prevent the spread of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, the fungus that causes ash dieback. He said all precautions have been appropriate.</p> <p>The Guardian (1 November) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/uk-forests-unprecedented-threat-disease\" title=\"\">printed a timeline</a> which says the Horticultural Trades Association reported the disease had become widespread in Denmark in 2009 and that it called for a ban on imports. The government took no action.</p> <p>European countries have been asking for a ban on importation of sapling over the last two years. Nothing happened.</p> <p>In February 2012 the disease was reportedly present in a nursery in Buckinghamshire. No action was taken.</p> <p>In the summer of 2012 ash dieback was detected in plantations and nurseries across Scotland and in the UK. No action was taken. In October 2012 cases were identified in Norfolk and Suffolk. The government announced a period of public consultation which \"might lead to a ban on importation of saplings\".</p> <p>We are told \"100,000 ash trees have been felled\" to prevent disease spreading. I understand that 100,000 saplings have been destroyed.</p> <p>On 26 October Paterson announced there would be a ban on importing ash saplings. Does Paterson have a different concept of \"no delay\"?<br><strong>David Hurry</strong><br><em>Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex</em></p> <p>\u2022 I congratulate your correspondents, particularly Sara Maitland (We're all tree huggers now, 1 November) regarding the ash disaster. There is no defence against an airborne virus so it must be accepted the majority of ash in the UK will die. Then all efforts to minimise timber loss must be put in place. To do this, unaffected trees must be felled and stored for future use. We would then have ash timber available for 20 years. This would give tree owners a return from their losses. Diseased trees should be used for firewood. There is no point in restricting movement unless the Forestry Commission can prevent the airborne virus and prevent the wind from blowing affected leaves across the countryside.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Forestry Commission Scotland is to force owners of infected ash trees to destroy them or be fined \u00a35,000. Threatening owners with fines does not make for good relations, particularly as the commission may be blamed for allowing contaminated nursery stock from Europe into Britain. The Forestry Commission cannot continue saying \"it wisna' me\".&#xa0;</p> <p>Unfortunately, I can foresee multiple claims against the Forestry Commission going through the courts.</p> <p>In the meantime, I have asked the local Forestry Commission conservator for a meeting with other interested parties to clear the air and hopefully go forward together to make the best of a very bad job.</p> <p>Perhaps this time common sense will prevail over red tape.<br><strong>Donald Barker</strong><br><em>CEO, Broadleaf Trust, Auchtermuchty, Fife</em></p> <p>\u2022 We are not nature's custodians (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/biosecurity-nature-hurricane-sandy-ash\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 1 November).

The trade in plants, said Brasier at the time, \"is now highly globalised and yet most European nurseries and plant health organisations have little knowledge that they may be harbouring exotic Phytophthora pathogens \u2013 pathogens that should never have made their way to Europe at all.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>I concluded the article by saying: '\"Even as we digest the unpalatable truth that a broad variety of our native and non-native trees are under sustained attack from imported pathogens, it is being reported that yet another new fungus is now killing ash trees in parts of Europe.

This staggering degree of incompetence has been compounded by the earlier threat to sell off Britain's forests, and the subsequent heavy cuts to Forestry Commission budgets.</p> <p>Sadly the recent history of multi-agency failure, government cutbacks and new bureaucratic hoops to leap through has largely undone the vitally important work of dedicated individuals and the local authorities in the dutch elm disease control area between Brighton and Eastbourne. Here, some of Britain's finest remaining rural stands of mature elm are fast falling to the disease that devastated the countryside in 1970s. The dutch elm disease epidemic was, and remains, the most obvious reminder of what can happen if the globalised trade in timber and plants is not properly regulated \u2013 as it is in other island nations such as New Zealand.</p> <p>Fortunately the London-based Conservation Foundation, which has done so much to highlight the plight of the elm and repopulate the country with more disease resistant varieties (sadly the English elm has no resistance to the disease), is determined to try and save some of the remaining rural elms in East Sussex, possibly through annual anti-fungal injections.</p> <p>But whether the government has finally learned some lessons, and is able to counter the deadly ash disease and other threats to our native trees, we shall soon discover.<br><strong>Mark Seddon</strong><br><em>Singleborough, Buckinghamshire</em></p>",

Why not let the public decide? Over the last 20 years we have seen the rapid growth of over 5,000 local friends of parks groups committed to rescuing our urban green spaces from the scandalous decline they were plunged into by public spending cuts in the 1980s. Despite this rescue act still not having been completed for most of the 30,000 such spaces, our parks are facing a national funding crisis yet again.</p> <p>As everyone knows, urban parks, despite being a non-statutory service, are a priceless environmental and social resource for every community, and are the most well-used and popular of all our vital public services, on a par with the NHS. It is unacceptable that they should be starved of the staffing, maintenance and management they need. However, there are real differences between now and the 1980s. First, we now know the disastrous problems caused by underfunding and neglect, and the huge cost and effort it takes to turn it back round. Second, we now have a popular, grassroots movement which is going to speak out and demand effective action. Let's all ensure there's an active and vociferous group for every green space.

  "<p>The Bank of England will resist calls this week to pump extra funds into the economy despite concerns that a recent decline in manufacturing production and the weak construction sector could force the UK into a triple dip-recession. Policymakers at the central bank will debate how to generate growth after more than three years of falling living standards.</p> <p>With inflation consistently outstripping wages and a raft of cuts to benefits due in 2013, household incomes are likely to worsen, according to economists.</p> <p>The bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) is likely to keep its powder dry after the economy briefly sprang back to life in the third quarter when gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1%.</p> <p>A fall in unemployment in autumn and a modest rise in consumer spending have also offset worse-than-forecast manufacturing output, which has shrunk as the government's austerity policies and the euro crisis hit demand for UK goods.</p> <p>While some MPC members could vote to boost quantitative easing (QE) by \u00a350bn to \u00a3425bn, most economists expect a committee majority to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.5% and QE at \u00a3375bn.</p> <p>Both the BoE Governor and deputy governor, Sir Mervyn King and Paul Tucker, have suggested in recent speeches that the impact of QE is reaching its limit.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"While it still looks to be a close call, we believe the 1% quarter-on-quarter spike in GDP in the third quarter makes it more likely than not that the Bank of England will hold off from more QE.\"</p> <p>Members of the MPC have come under intense pressure to cut the cost of lending and boost credit in the economy as the Treasury maintains its determination to limit government to pay down debts.</p> <p>The MPC has waited to complete its last \u00a350bn of government bond purchases and a new direct-funding scheme for banks (funding for lending), before pushing ahead with another \u00a350bn of QE.</p> <p>Economic analysts, the CEBR, said the economy will remain weak in 2013 and 2014, though it will outstrip the eurozone as it copes with the double whammy of sharply declining incomes and rising debts in several key countries. The CEBR said the UK would grow by 0.8% next year and 1.4% in 2014 against a eurozone average of -0.4% in 2013 and 0.4% in 2014.</p> <p>\"Even assuming the problems of the euro do not cause an economic meltdown before the German elections next year, we are looking at a very weak economic outlook in Europe for the next two years\" said Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist at CEBR and main author of the report.</p> <p>However, the UK could fall back into an unprecedented third recession in four years if the 1% rise in the third quarter proves to be an Olympics-induced blip.</p> <p>The latest ICAEW/Grant Thornton UK business confidence monitor found smaller UK firms had scaled back plans for expansion in 2013.</p> <p>The report noted that a mood of caution suggests while some sectors and regions start to improve, \"economic recovery will be restrained in the next 12 months\".</p> <p>Michael Izza, chief executive of the accountancy body, the ICAEW, said: \"While the UK economy has come out of recession, business confidence is still very fragile. Against a backdrop of a softening global economy, the recovery is yet to take hold. More needs to be done to secure the UK's long-term economic outlook by encouraging businesses to invest and to stimulate growth.\"</p> <p>A survey of small businesses found that almost half were reluctant to invest in new jobs while confidence in the economy's ability to recover remained weak. The eurozone will slow the UK's recovery next year as the 17-member currency zone deals with a huge overhang of debts in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy.</p> <p>Greece is due to vote on \u20ac13.5bn of spending cuts and tax rises on Wednesday ahead of a budget vote next Sunday.</p> <p>Prime minister Antonis Samaras is confident he can win the vote to secure more than \u20ac37bn (\u00a330bn) of loans from the EU and International Monetary Fund.</p>",
  "<p>Authorities in the north-east United States are warning of a new crisis facing the region as cold weather heads towards tens of thousands of people who still have no power or heat and are living in homes damaged by superstorm Sandy.</p> <p>While much of New York City is approaching a semblance of normality, state governor Andrew Cuomo and the city's mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Sunday that plummeting temperatures were now one of the main threats facing residents in other stricken areas such as Staten Island and Long Island.</p> <p>Cuomo warned of a \"massive, massive housing problem\", with up to 40,000 people \u2013 mainly residents of public housing \u2013 needing relocating because of damage from the storm and the lack of electricity and heat.</p> <p>\"People are in homes that are uninhabitable,\" Cuomo told reporters at a press briefing. \"It's going to become increasingly clear that they're uninhabitable when the temperature drops and the heat doesn't come on.\"</p> <p>Fuel shortages are also having an impact on people with back-up generators. \"There are continuing issues with the fuel delivery and fuel distribution system,\" he said. </p> <p>But he added that \"there has been improvement, [and] there will be more improvement.\"</p> <p>The White House has sanctioned the release of an additional 12m gallons of unleaded fuel and 10m gallons of diesel. Much of that gas was being trucked to New Jersey and New York throughout the weekend.</p> <p>In the worst-hit areas of New York and New Jersey, which are still suffering six days after Sandy hit, there is growing anger among residents at the official response.</p> <p>In the Rockaways, an oceanfront section of Queens, Bloomberg was barracked by people as he toured the devastation over the weekend. Thousands there are still without power, and have been told they may remain so for days to come.</p> <p>\"When are we going to get some help?\" one woman shouted during an angry confrontation on Saturday.</p> <p>City officials have turned to opening warming shelters in preparation for a drop of temperatures overnight.</p> <p>Elderly people were being urged to move to these temporary homes. Meanwhile, about 25,000 blankets were being handed out to those who refused to move.</p> <p>But many believe the measures represent too little, too late, with some residents accusing the city of forgetting them in the rush to get the lights back on in the financial centre of lower Manhattan.</p> <p>\"Nothing right is going on here. There's old ladies in my building that have got nothing,\" one resident told Bloomberg during his walkabout in the Rockaways. In a one-to-one with the mayor, the man complained: \"This is the first drop-off site over the bridge, [and] we can't even get a bottle of water or a hot chocolate.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg promised that help was at hand, insisting that he understood their grievances.</p> <p>\"I spoke with many people who were worried and frustrated and cold,\" the mayor said at a press briefing Saturday. \"There is no power there and temperatures are dropping. Even those who have generators are having a hard time getting fuel.\"</p> <p>Gas shortages could continue for days, New Yorkers were told Sunday. Throughout the weekend, lines of cars queued up at pumps across New York. In neighbouring New Jersey, governor Chris Christie imposed rationing to cope with the scarcity of gas.</p> <p>At least 10 arrests have so far been made in relation to confrontations and line jumping at petrol stations.</p> <p>While parts of Staten Island and remote parts of Queens continue to struggle with blackouts, Manhattan is on its way to being restored to business as usual.</p> <p>Schools are due to reopen on Monday after a week out, and much of the subway will be running, though Cuomo warned commuters that the system may struggle to cope with the weight of traffic. \"There's been major progress but it's not going to be normal tomorrow,\" he said. </p> <p>\"South Ferry station, which had been a large fish tank, has now been pumped dry,\" he added. </p> <p>Cuomo also warned utilities firms that they would be held accountable for any delays that could have been prevented.</p> <p>\"I want them to provide the service that they get paid to perform,\" he said, adding: \"We will be reasonable, but we will hold them accountable.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg echoed governor Cuomo's call on utilities firms to up their game.</p> <p>\"We urge them to commit more resources to get power back to the Rockaways,\" the mayor said in an update on recovery efforts.</p> <p>Bloomberg also stressed the need to keep warm and check on vulnerable neighbours who made need help.</p> <p>\"It is cold outside and it will remain cold in the coming days. It is critical that people stay warm,\" he said in a Sunday afternoon press briefing.</p> <p>He spoke of an \"enormous outpouring\" of donations of clothes and food from members of the public but added that money sent to the Mayor's Fund would do more good at this stage as charity organisations were at capacity.</p> <p>Power had now been restored to all but 145,000 people across New York City. But 19,000 homes in the Rockaways \u2013 one of the worst hit areas \u2013 remained without electricity.</p>",
  "<p>As hurricane Sandy barrelled towards the&#xa0;east coast, <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121027/OPINION03/121026026/The-Des-Moines-Register-endorsement-Mitt-Romney-offers-fresh-economic-vision\" title=\"\">Iowa's Des Moines Register newspaper endorsed Mitt Romney</a> \u2013 the first Republican it had endorsed since Richard Nixon in&#xa0;1972 (look how that turned out). Arguing that \"the partisan divide had hardened\" under Barack Obama, the leader writers said: \"One of the biggest obstacles either candidate faces is partisan gridlock in Congress [which] has hampered not only the economy, but the entire country.\"</p> <p>A week earlier the Orlando Sentinel, which backed Obama in 2008 in the crucial state of Florida, made the same argument in its <a href=\"http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-10-19/opinion/os-ed-endorsement-president-mitt-romney-101912-20121018_1_trillion-deficit-reduction-plan-mitt-romney-obama-s-republican\" title=\"\">support for Romney</a>. \"With Obama in charge, the federal government came perilously close to a default last year,\" it said. \"It verges on magical thinking to expect Obama to get different results in the next four years.\"</p> <p>As Sandy inched closer, coverage of the campaign \u2013 like the campaigning itself \u2013 was suspended. All talk of gridlock was eclipsed by scenes of mayhem. One day reporters were standing in front of electoral maps analysing every poll, demographic and gaffe while speculating about the outcome. The next they were standing in sou'westers in wind and rain speculating about where it would make landfall. For a few days Ohio got a reprieve while New Jersey got a battering, and pollsters took a back seat while meteorologists drove the story.</p> <p>But when the winds subsided and the campaigns resumed, the dynamics of the race had changed and the validity of those arguments had been challenged. The hurricane and its aftermath helped illustrate the vacuity of this election campaign, what's at stake in its outcome, and who's responsible for the gridlock. With the frenetic polling and endless punditry, there may have been precious little calm before the storm but there was a greater degree of clarity after it.</p> <p>Beyond a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/us/politics/climate-change-nearly-absent-in-the-campaign.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">punchline for Romney at the Republican convention</a>, climate change simply has not come up during this election. Moderators didn't ask about it during the presidential debates, and both Obama and Romney were too busy posing as friends of oil and coal to mention it. While no single storm can be attributed to climate change, warming oceans make them more likely \u2013 and&#xa0;a clear pattern is emerging that would help to explain an occurrence such as Sandy. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/opinion/kristof-will-climate-get-some-respect-now.html\" title=\"\">As the New York Times's Nicolas Kristof pointed out</a>, three of the 10 biggest floods in lower Manhattan since 1900 have occurred in the past three years, while seven of the 10 warmest summers on record have taken place in the past 12.</p> <p>But to raise an issue like this during an election takes the kind of political courage that has long been in short supply. Given the hours of coverage and the billions of dollars devoted to the election, it's stunning how few of the nation's most glaring problems are being discussed. The US now has <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2012/01/30/120130crat_atlarge_gopnik?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">more people in its penal system</a> than the Soviet gulag at its height; its capital city has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/life-expectancy-varies-widely-in-the-washington-area/2012/04/19/gIQAjShVWT_story.html\" title=\"\">male life expectancy</a> lower than that of <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html\" title=\"\">the Gaza Strip</a>; and the country openly operates a system of torture and a policy of targeted assassination. The fact that nobody even expects these issues to come up tells you something about the low expectations Americans have of their politicians.</p> <p>But Sandy concentrated minds. Disasters have a way of doing that. Its arrival prised a much coveted <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-11-01/a-vote-for-a-president-to-lead-on-climate-change.html\" title=\"\">endorsement for Obama from the New York city mayor, Michael Bloomberg</a>, an independent who formerly ran as a Republican. \"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2026 brought the stakes of next Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" he said. True, Obama had not campaigned on it \u2013 but at the very least he acknowledges its existence, made some efforts to address it, and is not beholden to a party that refuses to accept the science.</p> <p>As Bloomberg was penning his endorsement, Obama was touring storm-hit areas with the Republican governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie. Christie, Romney's <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83254.html\" title=\"\">first pick for vice-president</a>, delivered a keynote speech at the Republican convention. The week before, he had <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/karen_heller/20121104_Karen_Heller__The_storms_before_the_calm.html\" title=\"\">described the president</a> as \"a man wandering around a dark room, hands up against the wall, clutching for the light switch of leadership, and he just can't find it\". Last week, when the lights went out, he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/the-morning-plum-chris-christie-drives-stake-into-romney-closing-argument/2012/11/01/2a435398-240d-11e2-ac85-e669876c6a24_blog.html\" title=\"\">praised Obama for his handling of the storm</a>, saying: \"The president has been all over this and he deserves great credit.\"</p> <p>While Sandy prompted both Bloomberg's and Christie's conversions, elsewhere in the country came evidence of a deeper split in Republican ranks. In the Nebraska Senate race, <a href=\"http://azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/gop-voices-for-kerrey-show-deep-split-in-party/article_891c6e6b-b0f6-5497-8bab-8c061bff62d4.html\" title=\"\">several Republicans came out against</a> the Tea Party-supported candidate and for the Democrat, Bob Kerrey.</p> <p>A week earlier, George Bush's former secretary of state Colin Powell \u2013 a Republican \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82860.html\" title=\"\">broke ranks again to back Obama</a>. \"I think I'm a Republican of more moderate mould and that's something of a dying breed, I'm sorry to say,\" he said. \"But, you know, the Republicans I worked for are President Reagan, President Bush, the Howard Bakers of the world, people who were conservative \u2026 but people who recognise that, at the end of the day, you got to find a basis for compromise. Compromise is how this country runs.\"</p> <p>Powell's breed may be further from extinction than has been apparent. For the past four years, Tea Party activists have been claiming they want to take their country back. Now a growing number of Republicans appear to want to take their party back.</p> <p>And so it was that by the end of last week you got a sense of what an Obama presidency might have been, and might be again, were it not for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/17/us-default-debt-ceiling-obama-congress\" title=\"\">the wilful obstruction of an opposition</a> whose primary stated aim was to deny him a second term: too timid for what is necessary but nonetheless the best that is possible within the narrow confines of American electoralism. Of course, he still has to win on Tuesday, which is by no means certain. But the dying days of the campaign put to rest one of the cases against him that has gained most traction among waverers.</p> <p>The arguments of the Des Moines Register and the Orlando Sentinel are true as far as they go. But they don't go very far unless they locate the source of the gridlock and hold to account those responsible for it. In the absence of that, handing the presidency to Romney becomes little more than <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/30/mitch-mcconnell-and-john-boehners-strategy-worked/\" title=\"\">a reward for bad behaviour</a>.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p>",

It burnished a reputation as one of the more conservative financial institutions in the runup to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p> <p>But its US operations, primarily the lender Household, were caught cold by the sub-prime mortgage crash and plunged the UK listed firm into years of write-offs and regulatory probes.</p> <p>The revised estimate of the bill for fines and charges by US regulators will underline the growing seriousness of investigations into the activities of UK bank subsidiaries.</p> <p>Standard Chartered has also come under scrutiny for allowing terrorists and criminals access to its banking facilities, while Barclays admitted playing a part in the Libor rigging scandal. Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to be fined for its part in the Libor scandal. Barclays faces another potential fine, following claims it rigged the price of electricity in the US.</p> <p>Gulliver has already apologised for \"shameful\" system breakdowns, which failed to stop the bank from laundering money for terrorists and drug barons through operations in Mexico.</p> <p>In the summer the bank set aside $700m (\u00a3445m) for potential fines in the US and another \u00a3900m for mis-selling financial products in the UK.</p> <p>Gulliver conceded that the eventual fine from the US authorities could be \"higher, possibly significantly higher\", after a Senate report found that its US arm had allowed it to launder money for terrorists and drug barons because of its \"pervasively polluted\" culture.</p> <p>At the time he refused to say how much more money would have to be set aside. Many shareholders, however, were braced for regulators insisting on a much larger sum, given the strength of feeling in the US against lax controls at UK banks.</p> <p>Gulliver, who took the helm last year after 30 years at the bank, lastly as head of the investment banking division, said at half-year results that the bank was reforming its \"federation structure\" to try to avoid a re-run of the problems in the US.</p> <p>\"I very much regret HSBC's past failures and very much apologise for them,\" he said. \"What happened in Mexico and the US is shameful, it's embarrassing, it's very painful for all of us in the firm.\"</p> <p>Executives responsible for the Mexican business have since left the bank. It is understood staff at the London HQ, on the Isle of Dogs, London, are preparing to claw back millions of pounds in bonuses paid to senior officials, who allowed billions of illegal dollars to be funnelled through the financial system.</p> <p>The bank, which is expected to announce quarterly profits of \u00a35bn, has confidently informed shareholders that it is no longer run as an operation with a presence in 80 countries \"where the country head is king\" but as an integrated business with four global heads to centralise standards and controls through a beefed-up compliance operation.</p> <p>Insiders say it will take Gulliver longer to reform structures that have dominated the bank for decades and provided a power base for many valued senior executives.</p> <p>The bank is also caught up in the Libor rigging scandal, along with several US and Swiss banks. They are accused of artificially inflating interest rates ahead of the crash to increase profits, and massaging them down in the wake of the crisis. This made it appear that their reputation was unharmed and they could access cheap funds in the market.</p> <p>However, Gulliver, whose bonuses are tied to the bank's reputation, did not make provision for any fine or legal cases. Barclays has been fined \u00a3290m for Libor manipulation.</p> <p>Since the summer HSBC has hired Preeta Bansal as its global general counsel for litigation and regulatory affairs, adding a third Obama administration official to support damage limitation efforts.</p> <p>Bansal will help manage litigation and regulatory risk, and report to the chief legal officer, Stuart Levey, the former sanctions official in the Bush and Obama Treasury offices, who was appointed in January. In August, the bank hired Robert Werner, a former head of the Treasury department's trade and economic enforcement arm, as head of global standards assurance.</p>",
  "<p>A cabinet minister came close to resigning from the government last week to take charge of the growing EU revolt against David Cameron, the leader of the latest rebellion has claimed.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/04/britain-could-thrive-outside-eu\" title=\"\">Iain Duncan Smith indicated that Britain could eventually thrive outside the European Union</a>, the Tory MP Mark Reckless said the unnamed minister \"weighed up the pros and cons\" before backing off.</p> <p>Reckless, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/31/politics-live-blog-pmqs-and-eu-budget-vote\" title=\"\">who defeated the government in a Commons vote on the EU budget</a> with help from a Labour three-line whip, told the Mail on Sunday: \"They seriously considered it.

The work and pensions secretary offered strong support for the prime minister's attempt to secure an inflation freeze in the EU budget. Reckless is demanding a real-terms cut.</p> <p>Duncan Smith said he disagreed with the rebels. He told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 of the prime minister's tactics: \"He would love to come back with a real-terms cut. I would love him to be able to do it. But we don't give enough credit to him \u2013 the first man to veto a European treaty. He has told us he will veto something [on the EU budget] that he cannot bring back to the British parliament. These are strong words compared to the last government and even governments before.\"</p> <p>The claim by Reckless shows at the very least that cabinet ministers were keen during last week's debate to burnish their eurosceptic credentials to rebel leaders. Reckless claimed that George Osborne, an Oxford contemporary, had shown interest in his amendment.</p> <p>Duncan Smith showed there was little love for the EU when he indicated that Britain could stand tall outside it.</p> <p>Asked whether Britain was big enough to survive outside the EU, the work and pensions secretary said: \"I am an optimist about the UK. We have been involved in trade with our European partners, which we will always be doing whatever this relationship is \u2026 I hate this argument that says little Britain or something outside, or Britain is part of a wider Europe. We can both be within our trading relationships within Europe but we can also be a fantastic global trader.\"</p>",
  "<p>Europe has become the place where nothing quite happens. David Cameron goes to Brussels demanding a freeze in the EU budget, while the European commission and parliament want a hefty 5-6% increase. It should be a storming confrontation, vetos threatened, walkouts happening. But we all know that, somehow, life will go on. It always does.</p> <p>Yet Europe is also the issue in British politics that is changing more than any other. Icy hostility is hardening. Those who want to leave are growing ever more numerous and implacable. Never has the pro-European voice been weaker and less certain.</p> <p>It isn't simply the opportunism of the parliamentary Labour party trooping through the lobbies after MPs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/04/andrew-rawnsley-tory-eu-rebellion-cynical\" title=\"\">Reckless</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeanfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Cash</a>. It isn't just the radical shift among Tory MPs, with pro-Europeans cowed and isolated. (I'm not even sure the phrase \"Tory pro-Europeans\" is still plural; is it only Ken Clarke now?)</p> <p>It's the shift among voters. According to polling in Cameron's own Witney constituency, 68% of Tory supporters there want a referendum on Europe and 29% would consider switching parties to get one. There's no secret about where they would go. National opinion polls show a steady rise in the Ukip vote; the most recent, for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/03/labour-tories-observer-opinion-poll?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Observer, puts Ukip third</a> nationally, ahead of the Liberal Democrats. Cameron is promising a major speech on Europe soon. But what can he say?</p> <p>This momentous shift is partly the result of the slow-motion car crash inside the eurozone, itself caused by the glaring differences between northern and southern economies. As Iain Duncan Smith admitted on Sunday, British politicians are <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/4111202.pdf\" title=\"\">waiting to see how the eurozone deals with its deep problems</a> before deciding how to react themselves \u2013 nervous bystanders by the crash site, watching the emergency services argue.</p> <p>So it may seem unfair to say that the second reason for the strong anti-EU tide flowing through the UK is an absence of pro-European leadership in Britain. Until people know what it is we're going to be part of, how can they make the case?</p> <p>Yet I would argue that this failure of leadership is fundamental and affects both the major parties. Cameron and his senior team are frankly scared stiff of the rising Euro-rejectionist tendency, too frightened to confront them. For Labour, sitting back and watching Tory turmoil has been too enjoyable to resist. It may even be an effective electoral strategy. Depending on how the numbers fall, it is not impossible that Ukip may deliver a Labour majority in 2015. The trouble is that all this opportunistic, tactical game-playing allows the argument for a complete break to grow, perhaps to the point where it becomes irresistible.</p> <p>A Labour party that has declined to pick a fight on the European issue with its natural enemies may find that the game has changed. Almost nobody is speaking up. The Gordon Brown camp's legendary hostility to the euro is morphing into general appeasement of the anti-EU mood. What <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/02/labour-expels-denis-macshane-expenses\" title=\"\">Denis MacShane</a> did in his expenses fiddling was unforgivable, but his departure from politics removes one of the few outspoken Europhile voices in national politics. Certainly no other Labour MP comprehends the European project so well.</p> <p>I can understand Cameron's lack of leadership. Ideologically, Tory free-marketeers have a deep problem with a single economic union. There isn't a great deal of space left for him to occupy between Brussels federalism and Tory Atlanticist anti-Europeanism. If you really think the City of London is Britain's last economic card then, yes, you'd be scared stiff of new EU-wide banking rules.</p> <p>Labour's lack of leadership is odder. Yes, there are populist tricks to be won on immigration and even on the EU budget. But if you look at Labour's developing domestic vision for Britain, what do you see? A major drive on technical training, regional industrial policy, the living wage and a rebalancing of the economy away from financial services and towards engineering, combined with business banks structured to invest for the long term.</p> <p>And what does that sound like? Germany. If Labour's vision of a better-grounded, fairer and more sustainable economy isn't quite a copy of modern Germany, it is at least remarkably close to the social democratic capitalism that has evolved under parties of different stripes across much of northern Europe. Ed Miliband's one-time guru Maurice Glasman could tell him as much.</p> <p>The German dilemma just now is about the depth of sacrifice Germans, and northern Europeans generally, should make to save southern economies that they regard as unreformed (and which they fear are unreformable). That is a domestic crisis for the eurozone, which isn't much helped by off-stage heckles from outsiders.</p> <p>But as Labour tries to define its new identity, after the neoliberalism and bust financial capitalism of the Blair years, many European economies still provide the best examples of what to aim for. When Labour argues for real, knowledgeable, locally based banking and training, supporting high-end companies, plus a fair tax system designed for citizens, not global parasites, it's arguing for a European future.</p> <p>It's obvious. Voters aren't stupid and they would get it. But it's something that needs to argued for. Soon it may be too late. Europe often seems a policy area where nothing happens; it's quite possible that Britain will vote for a neoliberal exit. And Labour should remember this: you cannot win an argument you haven't made.</p>",

  "<p>In 2006 the publisher of the Daily Mail passed up the opportunity to sell its regional newspaper business for about \u00a31bn, after bidders declined to meet its lofty expectations of a \u00a31.5bn price tag.</p> <p>Daily Mail &amp; General Trust is now poised to hive off regional operation Northcliffe Media, home to titles including the Leicester Mercury and Nottingham Post, into a joint venture led by former Mirror Group Newspapers and Mecom chief executive David Montgomery that values it at about \u00a3100m.</p> <p>This plummeting valuation highlights the battering the regional press has taken in the intervening period, with the industry one of the media sectors hardest hit by the growth of the internet and the post-credit crunch recession.</p> <p>Sales have slumped \u2014 the Leicester Mercury sold almost 100,000 copies a day a decade ago, today it sells 45,000 \u2014 along with advertising revenues. When DMGT rejected a \u00a31bn offer for Northcliffe in 2006, total annual UK regional newspaper advertising was \u00a32.5bn; today it is \u00a31bn and continuing to decline rapidly, according to media buying agency Group M.</p> <p>Further consolidation has been widely expected, and last week the starting gun was effectively fired with Montgomery's move, the first stage of a plan that he believes will reinvigorate the ailing sector. \"The industry is on a one-way street \u2013 everyone has been waiting for something to happen and unless there is market consolidation there will be no regional newspaper business,\" said one senior newspaper industry executive.</p> <p>The first stage of Montgomery's plan is to merge Northcliffe, the UK's fourth biggest regional newspaper group by circulation, with Iliffe News &amp; Media (the 11th largest), owner of titles such as the Cambridge Evening News, into a venture called Local World. DMGT and Iliffe will control almost half of the venture, with Trinity Mirror also in talks about taking a stake.</p> <p>Montgomery has backers lined up including hedge fund manager Crispin Odey and is also talking to former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft about a stake.</p> <p>Montgomery will have the benefit of not having to deal with Northcliffe's pension deficit \u2014 DMGT is taking responsibility. The company deficit stood at \u00a3370m at 1 April, although how much of that relates to Northcliffe is unknown. Pension issues have hampered previous negotiations between major players about regional newspaper consolidation.</p> <p>Local World will also not own any printing plants, saving it from the considerable associated costs.</p> <p>However, there is scepticism about whether Montgomery, who was ousted in January last year from Mecom, the pan-European newspaper publisher he founded, is the shining knight with the masterplan that the industry has been waiting for.</p> <p>Journalists who remember Montgomery's time at the Mirror titles in the 1990s, when he had a reputation as a brutal cost cutter, may shudder at the thought of his return to UK newspapers.</p> <p>\"It is not a particularly compelling business; the combination will still leave them fourth in the pecking order of regional newspaper groups,\" said a former senior newspaper executive.</p> <p>\"Montgomery knows the regional business and it unequivocally needs to be done, but after Mirror Group and Mecom I'm surprised it is him and not an existing big player starting this.\"</p> <p>The big player most fancied to have done so is Trinity Mirror, the biggest UK publisher with regional titles including the Liverpool Echo and Newcastle Journal, which has spotted the potential of Local World. Trinity is negotiating to take a stake, thought to be less than 20%, but will not at this point be merging its titles into Local World.</p> <p>\"It is not possible to reverse the structural change in the industry but it is possible to start to develop a business much more appropriate with dealing with it,\" said one source. \"Local publishers tend not to recognise the value of what they have, who else has the infrastructure to collect local content and exploit it? They just don't seem to have got off first base in the digital world. Consolidation can give a new lease of life if savings are invested in modernisation.\"Putting Trinity Mirror's 100-plus titles into Local World would create a super-player much better able to cope with the digital challenge. One analyst compared such a super-merger to the regional newspaper equivalent of the joint venture between book publishers Penguin and Random House, a move designed to try to keep pace with digital upstarts such as Amazon.</p> <p>The critical question is whether the tough stance taken by competition regulators will finally soften in light of the parlous state of the regional market.</p> <p>One observer points out that Montgomery will be keenly watching the outcome of the Competition Commission's investigation into Global Radio's takeover of GMG Radio. That deal brings together the biggest and third biggest players in the UK radio market, and has been struck in the face of many of the same issues facing regional newspapers.</p> <p>\"How the regulator views local market competition will be make or break for whether Montgomery can really lead consolidation \u2013 the radio ruling will be the test for Local World's plans,\" said one source. \"The idea that local publishers restrict and control media content in the internet age is ridiculous. Montgomery has no plan if regulators don't acknowledge this.\"</p>",

Activists are following the candidate on the campaign trail, to shout out questions about climate change from the rope line.</p> <p>The two new anti-Romney ads mix the Republican candidate's off-hand remarks about sea-level rise and global warming with scenes from the devastation wrought by Sandy.</p> <p>\"I'm not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the planet,\" says a relaxed-looking Romney, as his wife Ann looks on, in the ad produced by the League of Conservation Voters.</p> <p>The group has spent more than $13m on ads in these elections, more than the 2006, 2008 and 2010 elections combined. Most of that has gone on ads attacking Republican House and Senate leaders who do not accept climate science.</p> <p>Another campaign ad produced by Forecast the Facts uses a clip from Romney's now notorious convention speech in which he mocked Obama's 2008 campaign pledge to act on climate change.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZENtH3psXl4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZENtH3psXl4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jX796xAbbk&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\">activists are turning up at Romney's rallies </a>demanding: \"Do you still believe global warming is funny?\"</p> <p>Sandy finally made climate change an issue in the presidential elections \u2013 after months with virtually no mention from Obama or Romney on the campaign trail.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\">Michael Bloomberg's decision to snub Romney and endorse Obama</a> \u2013 because of the president's work on climate change \u2013 has also focused attention on the issue.</p> <p>\"It's become more immediate. People are not thinking about climate change as far away and in the future any more,\" said Daniel Souweine of Forecast the Facts.</p> <p>\"It's shifting from a kind of scientific conversation to a moral one.\"</p> <p>The group, which focuses on pushing back against climate change denial, has been raising money off Romney's convention speech.</p> <p>It plans to run the climate ad in the Washington DC suburbs of northern Virginia, a strongly Democratic area in the battleground state, and around Columbus, Ohio, which typically is a swing district.</p> <p>Souweine said the group hoped to expand to New Hampshire, where Romney plans to hold his final rally on Monday, or to North Carolina.</p> <p>The prospect of going on the air in North Carolina has excited some activists. Last June, state officials voted to ban discussion of future sea-level rise, in what was seen as an attempt to stop debate on global warming.</p> <p>After Sandy, campaigners hope such a posture will become politically untenable.</p> <p>\"We cannot risk having leaders in Washington who turn a blind eye to the threat of climate change and the devastating impact it's having,\" Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters said.</p>",
  "<p>Now that Sandy has exacted a steep toll in lives and property, the question is unavoidable: why do so many people in America refuse to take climate science seriously?</p> <p>I am not assuming that Sandy was the direct consequence of human-caused climate change. But with this fresh evidence of the impact of climate issues on real people, how is it possible for anyone to think that thousands of scientists around the world are engaged in an elaborate hoax? </p> <p>The standard reply is that some powerful organizations \u2013 above all, in the fossil fuel industry \u2013 think that they can benefit from misleading the public, and have funded a successful disinformation campaign. There is a lot of truth to this answer, but it isn't the whole truth. </p> <p>For the average climate science denier in the street (and there are a lot of them on some streets), there is often little correlation between the vehemence of their denials and the so-called \"facts\" at their disposal. The average Chuck is like Chuck Norris, who has <a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/chucknorris/2009/12/08/chestnuts_roasting_on_a_copenhagen_fire/page/full/\">claimed that climate science is a \"trick\"</a>. Not an innocent mistake, not a systemic bias, but a premeditated fraud.</p> <p>Climate science denial needs disinformation to survive, but it has its feet firmly planted in a part of American culture. That culture draws on lots of different sources. But if you want to understand it, you need to understand something about America's religious landscape. </p> <p>Take a look at some of the most recent initiatives in the climate science denial wars. In Louisiana, Tennessee, New Hampshire and other states, legislatures have either passed or put forward bills intended to disinform secondary-school students about climate science. Sure, they paper over the assault on education with claims that they only want to teach \"both sides\" of the issue and encourage \"critical thinking\". But, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/feb/15/leaked-heartland-institute-documents-climate-scepticism\">leaked documents made clear in at least one instance</a>, the ultimate purpose is to produce a young generation of \"skeptics\" whose views on climate science will happily coincide with those of the fossil fuel industry.</p> <p>Who is behind these programs of de-education?</p> <p>The group writing much of the legislation is the <a href=\"http://www.alec.org\">American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec)</a>, a \"nonpartisan\" consortium of state legislators and business interests that gets plenty of money from the usual suspects. But the legislation has also received vital support from groups associated with the religious right. For example, the perversely named Louisiana Science Education Act, which opens the door to climate science denial in the classroom, was co-authored by the Discovery Institute, a Seattle-based creationist thinktank. That act also received <a href=\"http://lasciencecoalition.org/2012/01/05/gutting-bese-policy-untold-story/\">crucial support from the Alliance Defending Freedom</a>, the well-funded Christian legal advocacy group that has described itself as \"a servant organization that provides the resources that will keep the door open for the spread of the Gospel\", and which promotes a radical religious agenda in public schools. </p> <p>What does religion have to do with climate science? Radical religious activists promote the anti-science bills, in part, because they also seek to undermine the teaching of evolution \u2013 another issue that supposedly has \"two sides\", so schools should \"teach the controversy\". Now, you don't have to believe that Earth was created in six hectic days in order to be skeptical about climate science, but a large number of climate science deniers also happen to be evolution deniers. </p> <p>What exactly is the theology of climate science denial? The <a href=\"http://www.cornwallalliance.org\">Cornwall Alliance</a> \u2013 a coalition whose list of signatories could double as a directory of major players in the religious right \u2013 has a produced a <a href=\"http://www.cornwallalliance.org/articles/read/an-evangelical-declaration-on-global-warming/\">declaration asserting</a>, as a matter of <em>theology</em>, that \"there is no convincing scientific evidence that human contribution to greenhouse gases is causing dangerous global warming.\"</p> <p>It also tells us \u2013 on the firm foundation of Holy Scriptures \u2013 that policies intended to slow the pace of climate change represent a \"dangerous expansion of government control over private life\". It also alerts us that the environmental movement is \"un-Biblical\" \u2013 indeed, a new and false religion. If the Cornwall Declaration seems like a tough read, you can get what you need from the organization's DVD series: \"Resisting the Green Dragon: A Biblical Response to one of the Greatest Deceptions of our Day.\"</p> <p>Now, this isn't the theology of every religion in America, or of every strain of Christianity; not by a long stretch. Most Christians accept climate science and believe in protecting the environment, and many of them do so for religious as well as scientific reasons. But theirs is not the theology that holds sway in the upper reaches of the Republican party, or moves your average climate science denier Chuck. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/07/rick-santorum-global-warming-hoax_n_1260168.html\">Rick Santorum explained at an energy summit in Colorado</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We were put on this Earth as creatures of God to have dominion over the Earth \u2026 for our benefit not for the Earth's benefit.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Why does this theology of science denial have such power? For one thing, it gives its adherents something to throw back in the face of all those obnoxious \"elites\", which they think are telling them what to do with their lives. There's no need to master the facts if all you need is to learn a few words of scripture. </p> <p>But, perhaps, more to the point is that this kind of religion works for Chuck because it allows him to disguise the extraordinary selfishness of his position in a cloak of sanctimony. Translated into the kind of language that you can take to the shopping mall, it says that God wants you to squeeze whatever you can out of the earth \u2013 and to hell with the grandkids.</p> <p>I hear plenty of cynicism about the choice facing people this Tuesday, 6 November. Some say that it really doesn't matter who gets elected. It is true that Obama has largely kept climate change out of the campaign. But it is delusional to imagine that Obama is just the same as Romney and the Republican party on this issue. Paul Ryan is <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/11/677051/meet-paul-ryan-climate-denier-conspiracy-theorist-koch-acolyte/\">on record as a world-class climate science denier</a>. <a href=\"http://www.desmogblog.com/2012/10/31/romney-aide-andrea-saul-denies-climate-connection-hurricane-katrina-sandy-next\">Mitt Romney's press secretary</a> has been a shill for oil companies.</p> <p>Romney's proposals on energy policy and climate issues, so far as they can be discerned, are indistinguishable from those of the fossil fuel industry. And anyone who thinks that Republican party policies won't be informed by some of that old-time religion simply hasn't been listening to what its candidates have to say about women, reproductive rights, and what they speciously call \"religious liberty\".</p> <p>There is a choice. And even if <em>you</em> don't think it matters, your grandkids will.</p>",
  "<p>It has become fashionable to suggest there is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/opinion/two-candidates-one-foreign-policy.html\" title=\"\">little difference between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney</a> on the main international challenges facing the US and its allies, and that few real changes in American foreign policy will result should the Republican win. Such assessments are dangerously shortsighted.</p> <p>Romney's whole approach is underpinned by delusional nostalgia for the 1980s, a harking back to the cold war era, when the US believed it led the world in facing down the \"evil empire\" (the Soviet Union), when whole continents were divided into tame client nations or rogue states, and when western (meaning American) values were promoted as a nonpareil paradigm for all to follow.</p> <p>Like most conservative Republicans, Romney's No 1 hero is Ronald Reagan, president from 1981 to 1989. Romney's philosophy and vocabulary draw heavily on the Gipper. Hence his headline theme of \"A New American Century\", his insistence on America's unique international leadership role, and his Reaganesque belief in the US as a moral beacon offering a superior guiding light to the world \u2013 the \"shining city on a hill\" of Reagan's 1976 convention speech that launched the so-called Reagan revolution.</p> <p>\"This is what makes America exceptional: It is not just the character of our country \u2013 it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership \u2013 a history that has been written by patriots of both parties. That is America at its best,\" Romney <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/blog/foreign-policy-address-virginia-military-institute\" title=\"\">told the Virginia Military Institute</a> last month.</p> <p>\"It is the responsibility of our president to use America's great power to shape history \u2013 not to lead from behind,\" he added with a sneer aimed at Obama. Evidently relishing the role of Reagan retread, Romney has been busily colouring in the world map to the simplistic, neo-imperial design favoured by his late mentor. Hence <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/russia\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin's Russia is resurrected as a prime foe</a>. \"Russia is a destabilising force on the world stage. It needs to be tempered,\" Romney says.</p> <p>Despite recent attempts at moderation, the Romney doctrine also posits confrontation over co-operation with China, a communist rival whose economy will outgrow the US by the end of the decade. It is thus a fitting heir to the \"evil empire\". Tariff wars over Chinese imports may be just the start. Romney appears to see the western Pacific as a <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/china-east-asia\" title=\"\">whole new cold war-style conflict zone</a>.</p> <p>\"China must be discouraged from attempting to intimidate or dominate neighbouring states... [I] will implement a strategy that makes the path of regional hegemony for China far more costly than the alternative path of becoming a responsible partner in the international system,\" he writes on his website.</p> <p>Reprising the rogue state theme, Romney promises a tougher line on Iran's nuclear activities (which he insists must halt completely); says he will arm Syria's rebels; threatens a virtual blockade of nuclear-armed North Korea; vows to avenge war crimes allegedly committed by Sudan's leadership; and warns the Palestinians that any attempt to assert their statehood without Israel's prior agreement will bring heavy penalties.</p> <p>According to Romney's manifesto, this will be underwritten by a massive expansion of defence spending, again echoing Reagan's 1980s. \"It was American resolve and power that helped to liberate the captive nations of eastern Europe and precipitate the collapse of the USSR. It is America today that patrols the global commons and keeps them safe for trade and commerce,\" <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/national-defense\" title=\"\">Romney proclaims</a>.</p> <p>To achieve this end and ignoring record federal debt, Romney plans to add $2tn (\u00a31.24tn) over the next decade to the Pentagon's already enormous $711bn annual budget. At the same time, he proposes a supra-national, worldwide \"Reagan Economic Zone\" (sic) to extend the benefits of free enterprise and open markets to every corner of the globe. Rarely have guns and butter been so blatantly linked in a policy platform.</p> <p>Obama, in contrast, is more prosaic. He promises a prolongation of the cautious, pragmatic-aspirational foreign policy that characterised his first term and disappointed many supporters. Specifically, this includes tight focus on the Afghanistan-Pakistan withdrawal, ongoing global operations against al-Qaida and linked jihadi groups, careful management of the Arab spring and Iran dossiers, new emphasis on Asia and denuclearisation, and global alliance-building.</p> <p>But an Obama second term would also mean reinforcement of a refreshing intellectual recalibration that is the antithesis of Romney's old world imperialism and more closely matched to evolving global power relations.</p> <p>\"Obama is neither an out-of-his-depth naif nor a reactive realist. He has been trying to shape a new liberal global order with the US still in the lead but sharing more responsibilities and burdens with others where possible or necessary,\" <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137516/martin-indyk-kenneth-lieberthal-and-michael-e-ohanlon/scoring-obamas-foreign-policy\" title=\"\">wrote Martin Indyk and others in Foreign Affairs</a>.</p> <p>\"The Obama approach has been relatively non-ideological in practice but informed by a realistic overarching sense of the US role in the world in the 21st century. The tone has been neither that of American triumphalism and exceptionalism nor one of American decline. On balance, this approach has been effective.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Great Recession has been hard on world leaders. Gordon Brown, Nicolas Sarkozy and Silvio Berlusconi are all history. Angela Merkel has her date with destiny next autumn, and Barack Obama has hison Tuesday.</p> <p>US political history would point to Obama joining the list of recent political casualties. He was billed as the heir to Roosevelt when elected during the worst slump since the 1930s, but he has been no FDR. Recovery has been weak, unemployment slow to come down, inequality has got worse and vested interests left untouched. If the Republicans had been able to put up a candidate with even a hint of Ronald Reagan's charisma, Obama would be going the way of Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>To be sure, Obama has not had it easy. He has been faced with venomous opposition from Republicans in Congress determined to obstruct the White House every inch of the way. What's more, the poor state of the economy over the past four years largely reflects stuff that happened before Obama became president.</p> <p>It was George W Bush who took the budget surpluses Bill Clinton bequeathed to him and turned them into whopping deficits; Bush who was in the White House when the biggest property bubble in US history was allowed to inflate; and Bush who was president when Lehman Brothers went bust, sending the global economy into a tailspin. By the time of Obama's inauguration in early 2009, the profile for global industrial production and trade was similar to that in the early stages of the Great Depression.</p> <p>The recession arrived at a time when the US was structurally weak. Stephen King, the chief economist at HSBC, has noted that in the past decade growth in the world's biggest economy has consistently failed to live up to expectations, while inflation has been higher.</p> <p>Growth in the 2000s was lower than in the 1990s, which in turn saw slower expansion than the 1980s. The great boost to growth that was supposed to come from the IT revolution did not materialise, mainly because the spoils of growth were so unevenly divided.</p> <p>Real median incomes have been virtually flat for decades, with top-ups from tax credits less generous than in Europe. That left Americans reliant on the drug of debt to finance their consumption habit.</p> <p>Recoveries from recessions that are rooted in financial crises always take time, and this one has been made still more sluggish by high oil prices, which have taken spending power away from consumers and raised business costs.</p> <p>Central banks respond to downturns by cutting interest rates in the hope that cheaper borrowing will encourage spending and investment, but when the banks are licking their wounds and reluctant to lend, credit flows dry up even when interest rates drop close to zero. Hence the willingness of the Federal Reserve to try unconventional measures such as quantitative easing \u2013 creating electronic money \u2013 in the hope that it can get spending going again. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, says QE has prevented an even deeper downturn, but one side-effect may have been speculation in commodity markets that has driven up the cost of food and fuel.</p> <p>The case for Obama is that he has done as good a job as could be expected in the circumstances. There has been no return to the 1930s. The US economy is bigger than it was before the recession started, something that cannot be said of the UK. Unemployment is lower \u2013 just about \u2013 than it was when he arrived in the White House and there has been a pick-up in jobs growth in recent months. The car industry has been rescued, which it would not have been had Mitt Romney been president. Fewer people are being thrown out of their homes now that the real estate market has started to recover.</p> <p>Seen from the eurozone, where things are going from bad to worse, this looks like a reasonable record. It is not, though, the stuff of a new FDR.</p> <p>There are two main criticisms of Obama \u2013 one from the right and one from the left. Romney's case is that the president has hampered recovery by tying the economy up in knots and by allowing national debt to explode to 100% of national output. Businesses have been reluctant to hire and invest in new plant as a result of the uncertainty caused, hence the sluggish growth. The Republican challenger for the White House would cut taxes, cut spending, eliminate tax loopholes and take the axe to bureaucracy. US enterprise would be unleashed and job creation would accelerate.</p> <p>The Keynesian left, however, says Obama erred by being too cautious. He was too optimistic about the economy's ability to bounce back from deep recession. He used up all his political capital getting his healthcare bill through and paid too little attention to getting the economy back on its feet. He delivered a stimulus package just shy of $800bn (\u00a3500bn) but it was not big enough to counter the lingering effects on growth of the financial crisis. Paying far too much heed to Bill Clinton's economic advisers such as Larry Summers, he backed away from root-and-branch reform of Wall Street. Timidity has resulted in an underperforming economy leaving those who voted for Obama with gusto in 2008 feeling sorely let down. The fact that the president doesn't seem to have much of a clue about what he would do in a second term has compounded the problem.</p> <p>If Obama wins, it will be because he saved General Motors \u2013 the one moment he did come close to being a second FDR \u2013 and because of the fear that Romney would be even worse, with tax cuts favouring the rich and spending cuts that would hurt the poor. It is hard to know what Romney would do because his economic plan is full of holes. He might be a hardline fiscal conservative who would plunge the US into a double-dip recession by imposing austerity too soon. On the other hand, he might prove to be a closet Keynesian, following Reagan's approach with unfunded tax cuts that stimulate growth at the expense of a ballooning deficit.</p> <p>Whoever wins will have to confront the looming fiscal cliff, the package of tax increases and spending cuts due to be enacted in January 2013. As things stand, it will be Obama who has to come to terms with Congress following an unenthusiastic endorsement on Tuesday. After that, he might like to get down to the unfinished business of his first term: jobs, tackling poverty and inequality; repairing America's decaying infrastructure; and getting serious about the issue that in the past week has saved his bacon: climate change.</p>",
  "<p>Hot on the heels of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/28/barclays-libor-guardian-care-homes?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Libor scandal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/30/hsbc-700m-money-laundering-apology\" title=\"\">money-laundering at HSBC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/standard-chartered-fine-iran-sanctions\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered Bank</a> comes the allegation that Barclays Bank attempted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/barclays-regulatory-scrutiny-third-quarter-loss?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">manipulate the US energy markets to make profits</a>. Of course, Barclays has no direct interest in buying or selling oil, gas or electricity. Its aim is to make profits by betting on the price changes, a process that often drives up the price of the underlying commodity and forces ordinary people to pay sky-high prices.</p> <p>This speculative activity is facilitated by complex financial instruments known as derivatives, described by investment guru Warren Buffett as \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". Behind the technical jargon lies a giant gambling machine, which bets on anything that can be priced. The hard cash needed to settle the outcome of the bets is always highly uncertain until the contracts mature, which could be 10 to 15 years in the future. And, like other bets, derivatives don't always pay off \u2013 as the cases of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/375259.stm\" title=\"\">Nick Leeson at Barings</a> and more recently <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20067510\" title=\"\">J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</a> exemplify.</p> <p>The UK government claims that speculation <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2012/speech616.pdf\" title=\"\">will be curbed by a separation of investment banking from the retail side</a>. This, it is claimed, will protect savers and taxpayers from the toxic effects of risky positions adopted by bankers. This policy will not work. Even after separation, investment banks will continue to use funds from retail banks, pension funds and insurance companies for their speculative activities. The speculators will continue to shelter behind limited liability and dump losses on to innocent bystanders. Unless the benefit of limited liability is removed from investment banks, their losses and reckless risks will inevitably be transferred to other sectors. The separation between retail and speculative operations needs to be accompanied by unlimited liability for investment banking, ensuring that those who take excessive risks are 100% liable for their mistakes.</p> <p>Derivatives are central to the current economic crisis. In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.marketturmoil\" title=\"\">Lehman Brothers collapsed</a> with 1.2 million derivatives contracts, which had a face value of nearly $39 trillion, though the economic exposure was considerably less. For nearly six years before its demise, almost all of the pre-tax profits at Bear Stearns came from speculative activities. It could not continue to pick winners indefinitely, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/15/creditcrunch.useconomy4?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">collapsed in 2008</a>. It had shareholder funds of $11.8bn, debts of $384bn and a derivatives portfolio with a face value of $13.4 trillion. The derivatives gambles also brought down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/feb/12/insurance.useconomy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">American International Group (AIG)</a> \u2013 the world's largest insurer \u2013 and Washington Mutual. Then in October 2011, MF Global, a US brokerage firm that specialised in delivering trading and hedging solutions, filed for bankruptcy. It had nearly 3 million derivatives contracts with a notional value of more than $100bn.</p> <p>Despite these high-profile casualties, risk-hungry investment bankers remain undeterred. The <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/\" title=\"\">face value of the global derivatives</a> trade is about $1,200 trillion (\u00a3749 trillion). With a global GDP of $65-70 trillion, the world economy is not in a position to absorb even 0.1% ($1.2 trillion) of losses.</p> <p>The UK's GDP is about \u00a31.5 trillion. Just three UK banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) \u2013 alone have a derivatives portfolio, with a face value totalling nearly \u00a3100 trillion. Barclays leads the way with \u00a343 trillion. It has recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/barclays-regulatory-scrutiny-third-quarter-loss\" title=\"\">reported a third-quarter loss</a> of \u00a347 million, but <a href=\"http://group.barclays.com/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadername2=MDT-Type&amp;blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3D2011-Barclays-PLC-Annual-Report-%28PDF%29.pdf&amp;blobheadervalue2=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1330686323829&amp;ssbinary=true\" title=\"\">its balance sheet</a> points to a more serious position. Barclays' last full-year accounts show assets of \u00a31.56 trillion and capital of only \u00a365bn, meaning that its gross <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/leverage\" title=\"\">leverage</a> is nearly 24 times its capital base. A decline of just 4% in asset values would wipe out its entire capital. Barclays' balance sheet shows gross exposure to derivatives of \u00a3539bn, though the bank could argue that this is offset by hedges of \u00a3528bn, leaving a net exposure of \u00a311bn. The difficulty is that the hedges, as Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Northern Rock have learnt, do not necessarily work in the desired way and always depend on the position of the counter parties in a highly unpredictable environment.</p> <p>Merely separating retail and investment banking will neither choke off nor contain the effects of toxic gambles, because speculative activities will affect other sectors of the economy. For any possibility of containing the crisis, speculative banking needs to have unlimited liability. Thus, if the bets go bad, bankers will personally need to bear the negative consequences. One of the tasks of the banking regulator should be to ensure that the size of the bets bears a reasonable relationship to the assets of the gamblers, so that cavalier bankers are not able to gamble more than they can lose. No retail bank, pension fund, insurance company or pension fund should be able to provide money to any investment bank without specific approval from its stakeholders.</p> <p>The above reforms will help to reduce speculative activity and quarantine the negative effects of reckless gambling. They will also remind neoliberals that the freedom to speculate needs to be accompanied by responsibilities.</p>",
  "<p>Iain Duncan Smith has come close to suggesting that Britain could eventually thrive outside the European Union, declaring that such a strong country can stand tall on its own.</p> <p>Amid reports that a cabinet minister considered resigning to join Eurosceptic rebels in last week's Commons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/cameron-commons-defeat-eu-budget?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">vote on the EU budget</a>, the former Tory leader told The Andrew Marr Show that Britain's long trading history predates its accession to the EEC.</p> <p>But Duncan Smith, who first made his name as a Maastricht rebel in the early 1990s, stopped short of calling for British withdrawal.</p> <p>The work and pensions secretary also offered strong support for David Cameron's negotiating stance in the EU budget negotiations, in which Britain will press for a freeze in line with inflation.</p> <p>The Mail on Sunday reported that a member of the cabinet considered resigning to join Tory rebels who combined with Labour last week to defeat the government over a demand for a real terms cut in the budget.</p> <p>Duncan Smith said he disagreed with the rebels. He told the BBC1 programme of the prime minister's tactics: \"He would love to come back with a real terms cut. I would love him to be able to do it.</p> <p>\"But we don't give enough credit to him \u2013 the first man to veto a European treaty. He has told us he will veto something [on the EU budget] that he cannot bring back to the British parliament. These are strong words compared to the last government and even governments before.\"</p> <p>Duncan Smith made clear that Britain would not be part of new governance arrangements for the eurozone that are due to be negotiated over the next few years. The coalition is agreed that moves to greater fiscal union in the eurozone are a matter for the 17 members of the single currency.</p> <p>Asked whether Britain is big enough to survive outside the EU, the work and pensions secretary said: \"I am an optimist about the UK. We have been involved in trade with our European partners, which we will always be doing whatever this relationship is.</p> <p>\"We are a member of the EU. That gives us benefits. But we have to figure out where that is going. In the world, we are a global trader already. We are more of a global trader than any country in Europe.</p> <p>\"I hate this argument that says little Britain or something outside, or Britain is part of a wider Europe. We can both be within our trading relationships within Europe but we can also be a fantastic global trader.</p> <p>\"We invest more in the US than any other country in the world \u2026 We have been a global trader all our lives. Your [Andrew Marr's History of the World] programmes show what a fantastic history Britain has, as a remarkable country for good and trade around the world. That is what we are today as much as we were 100 years ago.</p> <p>\"My view isn't that we could do necessarily outside the EU better then we are inside. It is that we can do it all. I don't see why we shouldn't have it all.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Sandy caused chaos across the Caribbean and America, bringing disruption to the presidential campaign (due to take place on Tuesday) and devastation to the lives of those affected in the towns and cities it has passed through.</p> <p>I was caught in the path of a hurricane once. In 2004, I was on holiday in the Dominican Republic when Hurricane Ivan struck. <a href=\"http://www.hurricanehistory.org/resources/Hurricane-Ivan.html\">Ivan</a> began as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_storm#Tropical_storm\">tropical storm</a> off the coast of Africa on 31 August, but by the 9 September, it had been upgraded to a category 5 hurricane.

But looking back I see that my own unstable upbringing was fundamental to becoming one. As I kid I went to 15 different schools. But I think what most influenced me was going to South Africa for my final year of high school. I won a rotary club scholarship to go there. I come from a very white, rural area of Australia and my family were pretty horrified that I decided to go.</p> <p>I'm not exactly sure why, but I've always been driven by social justice issues. I went to South Africa in 1992, it was the first year that black students were allowed into white South African schools. I was a kid of 16 or 17 and I saw things as very black and white \u2013 I didn't understand there were also many shades of grey and South Africa opened me up to the complexities of a country's and a community's problems.</p> <p>This was my first introduction to the concept of global citizenship. The family I stayed with were white. They were really loving people and who we would call their \"servants\" were seen as part of their family. They looked after their servants' family members and educated their children. It made me realise that people aren't necessarily bad even if they do hold views I don't agree with. It was also one of the first years that white students were taught about apartheid. I found it unbelievable that a girl from rural Australia would know more about black history and the policies of apartheid than my contemporaries who actually lived in the country. This really opened my eyes to ideas of how you shouldn't necessarily believe everything you read in the papers. I realised everything was more complex than I'd thought.</p> <p>I did a degree in youth work. I was very idealistic and I really wanted to help young people make something of themselves. I was really helped by the principal from my high school, <a href=\"http://www.emeraldsc.vic.edu.au/\">Emerald Secondary College</a> in the town of Emerald, Treva McGregor. He is still my mentor now. He was such a great down to earth bloke who always believed in spending time with you personally. I had a really bad stutter at school. I could barely say my name at high school. I did consider jobs that didn't involve speaking but none of them would have been right for me at all. But Treva really believed in me and that made such a difference to my life.</p> <p>Towards the end of my degree I realised I wanted to work in schools with young people. I didn't actually want to be a teacher at that time but you needed a teaching background to be a welfare officer, so I did my teaching qualification. I tried to persuade my university that I didn't need to do my teaching practice because I'd done so much youth work, but really it was because I was terrified of being in front of a class with my stutter. Of course they (quite rightly) made me do it.</p> <p>One of my teaching practices was at Lakeside Secondary School, an inner city school in Melbourne with a high ethnic makeup. It was such a tough school I swore I'd never go back but this was a time when teaching jobs were scarce in Australia and I ended up being offered a job teaching history there.</p> <p>Australia was quite behind the times in those days, especially in how you support kids with English as a second language. In some ways, I just put in the hours. It wasn't until I came to teach in England that I became more accountable in my practice. I think I really learned my teaching skills in England.</p> <p>But before I came to England to teach I spent an eye-opening year in Papua New Guinea on an Australian Volunteers International programme, which is a bit like VSO. People from the UK think of Papua New Guinea as a paradise but Australians don't think that at all and only go there for mining. It's got terrible problems with violence against women. I wanted to understand more about the issues there. Being in Papua New Guinea really made me realise how different people can perceive the world and events. I love the quote \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\" and discovered the truth of that in Papua New Guinea. I was astonished to find highly educated students who believed in curses and voodoo. It made me really reflect on how people can see the world in a completely different way, it was a powerful lesson.</p> <p>Then I came to England and got a job teaching citizenship in Manchester at <a href=\"http://www.reddish.stockport.sch.uk/\">Reddish Vale secondary school</a> and later in <a href=\"http://www.salfordcity-academy.org/\">Salford City Academy</a>. This was in the very early days of citizenship education, so it was a really exciting time.</p> <p>I realised citizenship was a subject I was absolutely passionate about. Not just teaching the facts, but teaching the skills and critical thinking behind global issues. One lesson I got a class year 10 kids to believe there was a tribe of Aboriginal mermaids in Tasmania. The kids were enthralled and went off with the homework of creating a timeline of the tribe, I told them to research it using Google.</p> <p>The next day they came back and said: \"They don't exist miss!\" We talked about how we don't typically question authority. They believed me because I'm from Australia and I seemed a valid source of information. It was a very powerful lesson. I want my students to challenge the things they hear on the news, or hear their families say - and even challenge what I say as their teacher.</p> <p>Citizenship is about helping students get to the bottom of the difficult questions. I was teaching at the time of the London bombs and there were lots of controversial questions that needed to be asked and difficult discussions to have. What better place to discuss these uncomfortable issues than in a citizenship classroom?</p> <p>I honestly believe you need to show your human side as a teacher. You earn respect as a teacher, you don't just get it. I would stutter in class but because I had a relationship with the students I found that if one of them teased me, before I knew it the other kids would be telling that kid off. The students saw me as a person, they got to see me fail, they got to see me grow. When I left England my students said they were proud of me. They said \"Miss, when you came here you couldn't speak \u2013 look at you now \u2013 you can't stop talking!\"</p> <p>If students are going to develop as global citizens they have to be able to question global issues. They have to find out about power balances and be actively involved in asking questions. It's so important not to just be taught about tragedies overseas and then to disconnect from that as it seems nothing to do with your life. I don't like citizenship to be purely about fundraising, I find that a very submissive way of dealing with an issue. When you humanise the stories then you start to make inroads. I think having these experiences overseas can help and I would certainly encourage my students to spend time in other countries. Teachers can also bring people into their classrooms who can tell their story. For me the questions started flowing when I went to South Africa and they've never stopped.</p> <p>I've been back in Australia since last January. I'm working with people who have been marginalised by their community and don't want to vote or or think they can't \u2013 and voting is actually compulsory in Australia. It's a combination of my citizenship teaching skills and community work. I actually think it's a great idea to have compulsory voting, it requires you to think about what you want for your community.</p> <p>I would like to get more involved in citizenship education here but I'm not quite sure whether to go back into classroom teaching, at the moment anyway. Citizenship has just become part of the new national curriculum which is being developed in Australia at the moment.</p> <p>But the thing is teaching takes over your life; it's not a job, it's a bloody way of life. As all teachers know, it doesn't stop. I'm really enjoying combining teaching with community work at the moment.</p> <p><em>Billy Crombie trained and worked as a teacher in Australia.

  "<p>When the Conservative MP Oliver Letwin toured his West Dorset constituency last June, he was moved to describe the landscape for his website. \"As I make my way on this gloriously sunny morning, dictating this article, I am reminded of the enormous responsibility placed upon us to be good stewards of this treasure and to hand it on undefiled to succeeding generations.\"</p> <p>Dictating, mind you, not writing. Nothing wrong in that: after all, he's a busy politician. But when you're writing, you have more time to reflect and if the thoughtful Letwin had been at his desk, he would surely have paused to ask himself whether the coalition could lay claim to such stewardship.</p> <p>The answer is that it can't. Like the Labour administration, the coalition has shown little regard for \"this treasure\" and no understanding that Britain's landscape is a finite resource that is slowly being depleted with each new government's plans for growth, jobs, housing, infrastructure and saving humanity from climate change. The truth is that ministers and civil servants do not give a damn about the countryside or its shrinking wonders.</p> <p>That's the only explanation for the failure of two governments to act on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/02/ash-tree-disease-10-years\" title=\"\">ash dieback</a>, the fungus that has caused Denmark to lose 90% of its ash trees and has now got more than a foothold in England. Naturally, they're now all jumping up and down in Whitehall, with a faintly ridiculous Cobra meeting last week and an announcement of accelerated tests of a treatment, which may stop the spread of Chalara fungus, but this crisis has been a long time coming. Labour did nothing to stop the import of timber and infected trees in 2009, while the coalition's response has been late, complacent and dilatory. We stop rabies at the border and the importation from outside the EU of seeds, bulbs, dairy products, cooked meats and a host of items that may bring disease into the country, because these things can directly affect people and their pets. But when it came to bringing in five million ash saplings, we simply dropped our guard. Until last week, an American college professor coming to Britain to give a lecture had a tougher time getting into the country than a diseased ash tree.</p> <p>The spin from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is that wind-borne spores are the cause. We will never know, but the response when the disease was identified nine months ago was amazingly sloppy and the resultant cull of dead wood could be usefully extended to Defra, which obviously has no idea what to do, apart from suggesting we wash ourselves, children and dogs after a walk. One wonders what Defra plans to do about birds, which fly from tree to tree without a thought for fungal hygiene.</p> <p>Others have written about the discreet beauty of ash, its useful properties and the punctuation and shape it gives to the landscape, so I am not going to dwell too much on what we stand to lose.</p> <p>Better to focus on the negligence and hostility that characterise the attitude of all governments to the British landscape, which ultimately, I believe, is responsible for the failure to act on Chalara and informs so many other areas of policy. Politicians pretend to draw strength from nature, but their actions tell another story, one that is littered with phone masts, wind farms and expensive and often unnecessary road schemes.</p> <p>Lest you misunderstand me, this is not simply about aesthetics but, rather, treating the landscape as an equal, not a slave.</p> <p>The self-delusion of our rulers is almost comic. At this moment, the government is considering a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9634667/Relax-laws-on-erecting-masts-in-conservation-areas-say-phone-firms.html\" title=\"\">relaxation of planning laws</a> to allow phone companies to put phone masts in conservation areas more easily by cutting the period for public consultation. The big four companies say the expansion of the 4G network will not be achieved unless they get their way, so it's likely they will. But this is obviously nothing new \u2013 energy companies are allowed to overrun local opposition to wind farms and politicians sweep aside objections to new road schemes.</p> <p>The problem is that there's no one in government speaking up for, or acting on behalf of, the thing we still, in a reflexive way, think of as an eternal benefit of being born here.</p> <p>Outside Westminster, the Campaign to Protect Rural England does its best to warn us of new depredations. Last week, it published a <a href=\"http://www.cpre.org.uk/media-centre/latest-news-releases/item/3116-unnecessary-road-schemes-costing-%C2%A330-billion-will-ruin-precious-countryside?tmpl=component&amp;print=1\" title=\"\">troubling survey</a> of 191 road schemes planned in England and Wales at a cost of \u00a330bn. This will be partly funded by local transport boards, packed full of business people whose aim is to develop more and more of the countryside.</p> <p>Plans include the northern and western Durham bypasses across green belt valleys (\u00a3160m); the Hereford bypass through the Wye Valley area of outstanding natural beauty (\u00a3157m); expansion of A303 in the Blackdown Hills AONB (\u00a3567m); and countless bypasses and roads driven into the country to open up greenfield sites for development. They will have an impact on 39 sites of special scientific interest, three natural reserves, 54 ancient woodland sites and 234 wildlife sites.</p> <p>Roads cause more traffic, not less, and they bring with them the promise of further destruction and grim, peripheral sprawl. Is this the right way to go, if you are not thinking entirely in terms of growth and profit? I doubt it. The problem is that intelligent reasoning and concern for the irreplaceable are absent from almost all these planning issues.</p> <p>The outburst last week of the energy minister <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225531/Minister-signals-end-wind-farm-We-pepper-turbines-country--declares-energy-minister.html\" title=\"\">John Hayes</a> focused attention on the actual benefits of wind farms. To most, wind turbines are proof that we are doing something about climate change yet, as a new book by Dieter Helm, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/scienceandnature/9780300186598/the-carbon-crunch-how-were-getting-climate-change-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it\" title=\"\"><em>The</em> <em>Carbon Crunch</em></a>, suggests, they have little impact on global temperatures because of China and India's increasing use of coal to drive their industrial growth, which we support with the purchase of cheap goods.</p> <p>Helm's argument is that while we have lowered our emissions, we have increased our carbon consumption, the key measure, by buying all these products.</p> <p>I don't mind Oliver Letwin bumbling around his constituency like a giddy country midwife, but as we watch the ash reduced to ashes, let's not forget that we, not politicians, are the only effective stewards of this land and if we want it to survive we make sacrifices. We don't buy all this crap from China; we don't allow our cities to haemorrhage light and heat; we don't allow ourselves to believe that wind turbines are going to save the planet; and we don't import trees that can and should be grown here.</p>",
  "<p>Jiang Xingsan's day job is helping to run a vast agricultural group, the All-China Federation of Supply and Manufacturing Co-operatives, which serves millions of farmers across China, and has increased its payroll by 200,000 in the past year alone. But he was in Manchester last week, paying tribute to the Rochdale Pioneers.</p> <p>\"I'm especially proud to come to Manchester, because this city was the birthplace for co-operatives,\" he says. When the so-called Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society set up shop in 1844, promising good quality food at fair prices, and a share of the profits for their customers, they couldn't have known that their big idea would spread around the world.</p> <p>More than 7,000 people, from 90 countries, gathered at the vast Manchester Central venue for \"Co-operatives 2012\" \u2013 part trade-show, part conference, part jamboree and the culmination of a UN-backed \"Year of Co-operatives\".</p> <p>Namibian weavers, Canadian bankers and Malaysian tour guides gathered with just one thing in common \u2013 their business model. Instead of being owned by shareholders, who extract a slice of the profits, all these co-operatives hand over any gains they make to their customers and staff.</p> <p>Before the credit crunch, co-ops were easily dismissed as worthy but irrelevant. But the crisis, and the failure of many developed economies to generate a sustainable recovery, have raised public interest in alternative ways of doing business. In total, co-operatives worldwide now have a billion members.</p> <p>\"There's more of a spring in our step now,\" says Ed Mayo, general secretary of trade body Co-operatives UK. \"We have emerged from the crisis still holding trust.\" Dame Pauline Green, who leads the International Co-operative Alliance, told the delegates last week: \"We know that co-operative banks, and credit unions, have not collapsed; they are not in receipt of taxpayer bailouts. Our arguments have begun to find traction with global decision-makers on the back of the sustainability and resilience of our financial model over the past five years.\"</p> <p>Mayo has been appointed by David Cameron as a mutuals ambassador, to spread the word: and he says the argument is a much broader one than whether co-operatives are more ethical than their rapacious corporate rivals.</p> <p>\"There's a big story here: not just about responding to the credit crunch, but how the UK economy could be more productive and inclusive if it moves significantly towards a co-operative model,\" he says.</p> <p>Much of the movement's energy in the past year has been directed at persuading the government to commit to bringing together all the legislation affecting co-operatives in one so-called Consolidation Act, as previous governments did for charities and company law.</p> <p>Cameron has promised a Co-operatives Act by 2015, and the Law Commission has been given the job of doing the technical groundwork. \"Our vision is it should be as easy and natural to set up a co-operative as it is to set up a shareholder-owned business,\" says Mayo.</p> <p>Peter Kimotho, who works on promoting co-operatives for the Kenyan government, also extols the wider benefits \u2013 beyond ethics \u2013 of a co-operative.</p> <p>\"We have a co-operative development policy in Kenya,\" he says, explaining that a network of co-operatives offers credit to farmers, and helps them to bring their products to market. \"That way, even small-scale producers are able to benefit from economies of scale.\" In total, Kenyan co-operatives have 10 million members \u2013 one in four of the population.</p> <p>\"The co-operative model is better because it empowers the small-scale producer; and in terms of decision-making, it's the policy of one man, one vote.\"</p> <p>Some of the co-operatives represented are on a mind-boggling scale: the giant Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative sells to 55 million farmers, who belong to 40,000 co-operatives. Its boss, GN Saxena, says they trust IFFCO not to hoodwink its clients. \"We do not play with the market. When there's a shortage of fertiliser, we make it available at the right price. We don't play with the quality or quantity.\" More importantly, though, every co-op member has been paid a dividend, every year since 1975.</p> <p>In the UK, Peter Marks, chief executive of the Co-operative Group, which co-sponsored last week's conference, and is trebling the size of its banking arm by buying more than 600 branches from Lloyds, as well as expanding rapidly into legal services, says the co-operative movement is enjoying a renaissance.</p> <p>\"I have been with the company for 45&#xa0;years, and for most of that time the Co-op was in steady decline. When I joined, we had 25% of the food market; a few years ago it was just 4%.\" When the idea of Co-op buying the Lloyds branches was first mooted, its governance was criticised, with commentators pointing out that it has, for example, a Methodist minister on its board, which is chosen by ordinary members. But Marks is unashamed of its democratic structure. \"My board is full of ordinary people \u2013 they're risk averse. Perhaps if Barclays and RBS had Methodist ministers on their board, they wouldn't be where they are now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Teachers most definitely are not \"the barrier to disadvantaged children breaking out of their situation\" (\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/28/will-hutton-education-aspiration-david-laws\" title=\"\">Yes, teachers ought to inspire, but they can't work in isolation</a>\", Comment).</p> <p>Neither David Laws nor Will Hutton presents one jot of evidence for this claim. It is more likely that teachers are among the greatest advocates for, and encouragers of, disadvantaged children. By all accounts, we have the highest standards and practice in the teaching force that we have ever had and this would not be the case without high aspirations for children.</p> <p>Poverty is the major barrier to disadvantaged children breaking out of their situation. Studies have shown that improvements to housing, health, environment and parenting skills of disadvantaged families result in improved educational achievements.</p> <p><strong>Dr Robin C Richmond </strong></p> <p>Bromyard, Herefordshire</p> <p>Will Hutton's stimulating article reminded me of the hindrance to social mobility created by our public school system: the present cabinet and \"top\" jobs are dominated by former public school boys. In these days of austerity, when the government talks continuously of \"fairness\" and is wide open to charges of privilege and hypocrisy, it's revealing that public schools are still given significant tax concessions. Public services are the poorer because the offspring of the wealthy enjoy life-defining, subsidised perks afforded by a private school education.</p> <p>A previous job took me to numerous private schools, most of which were extending their already well-appointed premises through the building of theatres, swimming pools, sports halls and lecture rooms. The public sector would benefit greatly if private schools paid full tax and wealthy parents made donations to their local comprehensive rather than to private schools. Social mobility would benefit, too.</p> <p><strong>David Curtis</strong></p> <p>Solihull, West Midlands</p> <p>Will Hutton is at it again. His insufficiently veiled attacks on state educators are beginning to appear positively Tory and Govean in nature, despite his surrounding them with coalition-baiting rhetoric.</p> <p>This time, we're failing to inspire working-class youngsters to escape their lot in the <em>X Factor</em>-style meritocracy we supposedly find ourselves operating in. In Hutton's world, encouraging an averagely intelligent child with practically zero home-academic support to see dignity and contentment in a career with Tesco or McDonald's is tantamount to a sin punishable by Will's own brand of paternalistic opprobrium.</p> <p>Hutton and his high-minded friends would be likely to see only failure in the many hundreds of intelligent, working-class students I have taught who have gone on to a university education, despite all the odds.</p> <p>Britain in 2012 is no meritocracy. Hutton is the first to assert this and one of the most important voices of the liberal left. It is all the more galling to be in continual receipt of his disdain. Not only are state educators frustrated almost beyond words by a rigged system that places so many barriers in front of our intelligent, working-class students, but we are still in the best position to effect change in this respect, should the political class ever stop changing everything we try to do in the cause of short-term electoral gain.</p> <p><strong>Terry Wood </strong></p> <p>London N1</p> <p>I fully endorse the comments made by Will Hutton with regard to David Laws. For years, I have been both a fully paid-up Lib Dem member and an economics teacher (now retired). From my perspective, Laws has a lot to answer for.</p> <p>At the same time, I take issue with Hutton's comments that in too many schools, \"... teaching is little more than getting through the day without incident, shepherding the barely controllable class to modest qualifications\". In my experience of three schools where I have governorship responsibilities, all the senior leadership teams are 100% committed to excellence and aspiration and this transfers to the majority of their staff.</p> <p>It is wide of the mark for David Laws to write of \"depressingly low expectations\" among teachers and careers advisers. I fear that he is about to do as much damage to teaching as he has already helped do to the UK economy.</p> <p><strong>John Cole</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong>Bradford</p>",
  "<p>There's something quaintly touching about the spectacle of two publishing conglomerates \u2013 Bertelsmann and Pearson \u2013 arranging for their book-publishing arms (Random House and Penguin respectively) to <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/29/us-pearson-idUKBRE89S0C120121029\" title=\"\">huddle together for warmth</a> against the icy blasts coming from California (Google and Apple) and Seattle (Amazon). When the deal (which still has to be approved by regulators) was announced, there was the usual corporate guff about \"synergies\" \u2013 aka job losses \u2013 and about how the new partnership will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/table/2012/oct/29/penguin-random-house-key-facts\" title=\"\">\"the world's leading publishing house\"</a>, which will give it \"the upper hand\" in its dealings with Apple and Amazon.</p> <p>Ho, ho. In the long view of history, the Bertelsmann-Pearson deal will be seen as just the latest instalment of a long-running story: a tale of formerly dominant industries trying to prevent their venerable business models being dismantled by the internet. The early victims were travel agents, record labels, newspapers, magazines and broadcast networks.</p> <p>In each case, the relevant executives could be heard loudly declaring that while it was indeed the case that the guys \"over there\" (gesturing in the direction of some other industry) were being disintermediated by the network, nevertheless the speaker's own industry was special and therefore immune from technological contagion. Universities and book publishers have been arguing like this for quite a while. The Bertelsmann-Pearson deal suggests that the publishers have finally heard the tocsin. Universities haven't got the message yet.</p> <p>The funny thing about the publishing industry is that long before it was really threatened by the internet it was busily rearranging itself so as to make it more vulnerable to it. The process was vividly described by sociologist John Thompson in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0745661068/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=0745661068&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=meme11-21\" title=\"\"><em>Merchants of Culture</em></a>, the best account we have of what happened to publishing. As Professor Thompson tells it, the transformation of the industry occurred in three phases. In the first, the retail environment changed as large chains (Barnes &amp; Noble, Waterstones, Borders et al) supplanted independent bookstores. This created a new phenomenon \u2013 the mass-market hardback. Second, a new breed of aggressive literary agent appeared, poaching authors and leaning on publishers for unsustainable advances for the aforementioned hardbacks. And finally, large public corporations (think Bertelsmann, Pearson, News Corp) started acquiring the smallish publishing houses that once constituted the bulk of the industry, in the process transforming something that was once based on private ownership, long-term thinking, the nurturing of authors and backlists into an industry driven predominately by the obsession of stock markets with short-term (ie quarterly) results.</p> <p>Thus publishing turned into an industry that was inordinately reliant on blockbuster products to deliver the results that Wall Street demanded. The result was a market characterised by what statisticians call a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail\" title=\"\">power-law distribution</a> \u2013 ie one in which a relatively small number of products sell in enormous volume while a \"long tail\" of other products sell in relatively modest quantities. The physical world of high street shops can't handle a long tail for the simple reason that shelf-space costs money. Every book has to earn its rent. But internet outfits such as Amazon don't have any problem handling the long tail; in fact, the company probably makes more from selling non-bestsellers than it does from blockbusters.</p> <p>Which is how we've arrived at the point where our conglomerate publishing giants are getting really scared. They can see themselves heading down the slippery slope that made the record labels prisoners of the Apple iTunes store, except, in this case, for Apple read Amazon.</p> <p>If you think that this might be good news for consumers, think again. Consider, for example, all those people who happily purchase books for their Amazon Kindles. (On the train the other day, five people in my immediate vicinity were reading on them.) The blogosphere was much exercised recently when a blogger, Martin Bekkelund, reported on the <a href=\"http://www.bekkelund.net/2012/10/22/outlawed-by-amazon-drm/\" title=\"\">plight of a Norwegian woman</a> \u2013 identified only as Linn \u2013 who found that she had lost all the books she had purchased for her Kindle. The device had been remotely erased by Amazon because of some mysterious \"problem\" with her account. Mr Bekkelund published the set of increasingly Kafkaesque emails Linn received from Amazon as she tried to find out why she had been victimised in this way. In the end, after the blog post received wide circulation, Linn's Kindle was \u2013 just as mysteriously \u2013 reloaded with the books she had bought.</p> <p>Except that she hadn't really bought them. All she had done was to buy a <em>licence</em> to read them on \"her\" Kindle <a href=\"http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/simon-says/2012/10/rights-you-have-no-right-to-your-ebooks/index.htm\" title=\"\">at Amazon's pleasure</a>. Which makes one wonder how the Trade Descriptions Act might view the company's invitation to \"Buy now with 1-Click\" on a Kindle book.</p>",
  "<p>One of the less convincing critiques of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">US presidential election </a>campaign, which winds up on Tuesday, is that there has not been much to choose between the incumbent, President Obama, and his challenger, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>The reality is very different. Instead, a stark choice exists. One can only judge a candidate on his past record and on what he has pledged to do in the future. Romney has said and done a lot of things, many contradictory, some deliberately so. It has been very hard to know during the campaign which Romney is real: the man who backed the precursor of Obamacare when he was governor or the candidate who suggested to donors that almost half of Americans were welfare beneficiaries beyond his political reach? Is he the centrist Republican of the first presidential debate or the man who insisted during the primaries he was \"severely conservative\"?</p> <p>Doubts about Romney have accrued not only from his ever shifting politics but also from a wider sense of flakiness. His economic policies have a touch of the fantastic. Romney would enact large tax cuts, reducing revenue, while increasing defence spending sharply, but also arguing he would eat into the deficit by spending cuts alone.</p> <p>On foreign policy too, Romney represents a return to the disastrous years of George W Bush \u2013 threatening confrontation with China by saying he would list it as a currency manipulator, while making bellicose noises about conflict with Iran.</p> <p>On the other side of the balance sheet, what is there to say about Obama? Few would disagree that America's first black president, who was once able to inspire with his oratory, has lost some of his lustre. The messages of hope and change ran aground in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, exacerbated both by the parlous state of the economy he inherited from his predecessor and by the two huge costly wars he was obliged to fight.</p> <p>If he has not transformed America in the way that many might have hoped, he has at least mitigated some of the pain while moving to bring to an end one of the US's greatest iniquities, its shocking inequality in affordable healthcare provision. Through the car manufacturers' bailout, his insistence on stress testing of banks and through carefully targeted stimuli, he ensured that the US now appears to be emerging from financial crisis with modest growth and a rise in employment figures even as those European governments that pursued a strategy of austerity are at very best bumping along the bottom. Obama steered a course between the left of his own party, who were advocating for populist but risky measures, and Republican obstructionism.</p> <p>On foreign policy, the Obama doctrine has been a mixed bag. He strictly limited US involvement in the most significant military adventure launched under his watch, in Libya, and has resisted Israeli pressure for military strikes against Iran. On the Arab Spring, he has preferred by and large to keep a watching brief and avoided an overt entanglement in Syria. After the war in Iraq, launched on a false pretence, and the mishandling of Afghanistan by Bush, this caution should be seen as positive.</p> <p>But while Obama may have brought an end to some of the human rights abuses of the Bush era, he has failed either to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay, as he promised, or moved to end the immunity of Bush-era officials implicated in abuses.</p> <p>On climate change too, Obama has been disappointing, not least on the campaign trail. In 2008, speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/\" title=\"\">Clinton Global Initiative, </a>he insisted: \"No single issue sits at the crossroads of as many currents as energy. This is a security threat, an economic albatross and a moral challenge of our time.\"</p> <p>Whoever is elected will face a new presidential term marked by considerable challenges. While the US is recovering from recession it remains weak and would be vulnerable to a number of factors, including a war in the Gulf over Iran disrupting oil supplies, China falling into recession itself or a further worsening of the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>He will also have to engage quickly with the \"fiscal cliff\", due at the year's end, when temporary payroll tax cuts are due to come to an end, which promises a tough choice between sharp tax increases for ordinary Americans that would threaten the recovery (but cut the deficit) or an extension of the tax cuts and a consequent increase in the deficit, an issue fraught with political strife.</p> <p>On the wider stage, the war in Syria is sucking in its neighbours, producing growing instability and, for all Obama's alleged commitment to negotiated solutions, he appears unable to engage Assad's main backer, Russia. The proposed draw down of the majority of US troops in Afghanistan by 2014 and the continuing tensions in Pakistan threaten another crisis.</p> <p>Despite all of these caveats, the candidate best equipped for the challenging period ahead is Barack Obama. While his campaign has hardly been inspiring, he remains a thoughtful figure who has taken his responsibilities with a seriousness absent from the Bush years. He has brought a new dignity to the White House and while there remain many who are still opposed to him simply for the colour of his skin, for many others he has achieved the remarkable by making it seem unremarkable that the president of the United States is a black man.</p> <p>His response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">hurricane Sandy,</a> praised by both the independent mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, and the Republican New Jersey governor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/oct/31/chris-christie-republican-pass-notes\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, was a belated reminder that there is a wider middle ground in US politics than the recent period of partisan disputes has often led us to believe.</p> <p>In the coming months, it will not be solely the new president's responsibility to confront the challenges facing the US and the world but all of those involved in the US political process. Any chance for healing and consensus after the elections should be grasped by all sides. This election offers an opportunity for a fresh start for US politics itself. It should not be squandered.</p>",
  "<p>With its subtitle heralding \"The New Industrial Revolution\", this is a book that never knowingly undersells itself. Every page and every paragraph rams home the same basic message: this is what the future looks like. The good news is that manufacturing is coming back. The bad news \u2013 at least for arty-farty types like your reviewer \u2013 is that we're going to be doing the manufacturing ourselves. Not in factories, of course, because that's so 20th century, but in our own homes.</p> <p>According to Chris Anderson, editor-in-chief of culture and technology magazine <em>Wired</em>, we will all learn to design our own products using universal software, and then either construct them with \"3D printers\" that inject plastic mouldings or email our designs to a fabrication unit that will make them for us. \"We are all designers now,\" he writes. \"It's time to get good at it.\"</p> <p>Thus a new cottage industry will grow that will rebalance a global economy distorted by cheap labour costs. In this revolution, claims Anderson, the workers will finally own the means of production. Innovation will thrive, excellence will prevail, inward-looking companies will be replaced by outward-looking communities, and all will be for the best in the best of all possible worlds.</p> <p>Anderson is no stranger to this Panglossian brand of futurology. He is himself a mini-cottage industry, turning trend-spotting into popular economic manifestos. In his first book, <em>The Long Tail</em>, Anderson argued that the internet had created a new business landscape, in which success meant selling less of more. It became the marketing mantra for every company that dreamed of high revenue from low sales.</p> <p>His second book, <em>Free</em>, took counterintuition one step further by asserting that giving products and services away for nothing would lead to long-term profit. Although the book was offered as a free download, its thesis didn't find many buyers. As with comedy, the secret of futurology is timing, and 2009 was not the year to preach a cavalier attitude to debt.</p> <p>The economic meltdown raised profound suspicions about the internet's intangibility, the ethereal limitlessness that seemed to encourage folly and excess. After all, Alan Greenspan thought \"advances in technology\" could secure endless credit.</p> <p>In <em>Makers</em>, Anderson plugs into a widespread desire to return to the material world of \"atoms\". The book is based on a 2010 article Anderson wrote for <em>Wired</em> entitled <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/01/ff_newrevolution/\" title=\"\">\"In the next industrial revolution atoms are the new bits\"</a>. The idea is that bits are software and atoms hardware. Up until recently, goes the theory, computer technology had enabled hardware controlled by corporations \u2013 books, newspapers, CDs etc \u2013 to be replaced by software that can be used by everyone.</p> <p>The next stage of this process, Anderson contends, is to use software to manufacture our own hardware. He cites the \"maker movement\" as the vanguard of industrial DIY. These designers and hobbyists are already using open-resource software and state-of-the-art technology (such as 3D printers) to create products that were once the preserve of corporate factories. Anderson compares the movement to Silicon Valley's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club\" title=\"\">Homebrew Computer Club</a>, from which people such as Steve Jobs emerged.</p> <p>\"The internet democratised publishing, broadcasting and communications,\" he writes, \"and the consequence was a massive increase in the range of both participation and participants in everything digital. Now the same is happening to manufacturing \u2013 the Long Tail of things.\"</p> <p>Perhaps. But is that necessarily a cause for celebration? You could replace the word \"democratised\" with \"devastated\" and that first sentence wouldn't suffer much of a drop in factuality. Just ask bookshops and the newspaper industry. For who has really been empowered? The masses, or Apple, Google and Amazon?</p> <p>Nor is it the case that democratisation has effected a dramatic change in the patterns of consumption \u2013 the bestsellers remain bestsellers, and the non-sellers disappear into depths. For every <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, there are a million shades of obscurity. By the same token, might not a possible scenario be that DIY manufacturing leads to a few individual successes and a mass of unwanted vanity projects?</p> <p>Still, it seems churlish to raise such quibbles in the face of Anderson's relentlessly upbeat prose. His book is filled with stories of unlikely characters taking a risk, showing what they can do, and coming out on top of new billion-dollar companies. And it's written in that jaunty, easy-to-understand style that American magazine writers do so well.</p> <p>But not so well that I really grasp what a \"CAD program\" is or, indeed, how a 3D printer actually works. For those of us still struggling to master inkjet printers, the future does not look very bright at all.</p>",
  "<p>I am not prone to gasp and nor would I describe myself as naive. But the scale of torture in the British security services, as revealed by Ian Cobain in this admirably researched book, took me aback.</p> <p>Cobain, an investigative reporter at the <em>Guardian</em>, invites the reader to look at the post-9/11 era in a different way. The so-called war on terror may, through the rendition of suspects to secret locations and the use of Guant\u00e0namo Bay, have brought into the public consciousness the brutal activities employed by authorities in the US, UK and elsewhere. But Cobain makes it clear, with devastating effect, that these were nothing new.</p> <p>The Brits have been torturing for generations. The author could have begun with the Boer war and the concentration camps that have UK copyright. Instead he starts his journey with the interrogation of German prisoners, not just during the second world war but long after it was over. \"Unbeknown to the Red Cross, the British were operating interrogation centres at three internment camps, while in Berlin there was a fourth within a former Gestapo detention centre,\" he writes.</p> <p>The retreat from empire did not take place without the odd electrode or kick where it hurts. From Yemen to Kenya to Cyprus, the British did whatever it took to hold their ground and to fend off insurgents. Torture, British-style, receives a brief dishonourable mention in Barack Obama's memoir, <em>Dreams from My Father</em>. His grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obama, having served in the British army in Burma during the second world war, was accused of being an insurgent. His third wife recounted how \"white soldiers\" \"would sometimes squeeze his testicles with parallel metallic rods. They also pierced his nails and buttocks with a sharp pin, with his hands and legs tied together with his head facing down.\"</p> <p>The further you delve into Cobain's book, the more depressed you become.</p> <p>Even as their economic and strategic power waned, the British were seen as global leaders in torture techniques. \"Our very simple system is admired,\" declared Brigadier Richard Mansfield Bremner, commandant of the British army's intelligence corps. The \"five techniques\" combined isolation, sensory deprivation, seemingly self-inflicted pain, exhaustion and humiliation. \"It was guaranteed to leave no marks that would result in either official embarrassment or the risk of war crimes prosecutions. It would, however, cause intense pain and terror, plus lasting psychological damage.\"</p> <p>Perhaps in those days it was easier to get away with it: deference was stronger and information was harder to come by. Even Amnesty, according to the author, was briefly happy to connive. Journalists were usually persuaded to turn a blind eye. The author valiantly sticks to the facts. But his absorbingly grim tale would have been enhanced by at least recognition of the competing arguments. That is not a call for moral relativism, but for an acknowledgement that the \"do whatever it takes\" argument resonates with much of the public.</p> <p>Labour administrations in the UK and Democrats in the US have been as keen on extra-legal coercive methods as Conservative and Republicans. Rendition was active in the 1990s under Bill Clinton. The author points the finger at ministers and officials in the Blair and Brown governments, who knew torture was illegal, and did everything they could to keep it out of the public eye. \"It was to be a dirty little secret,\" Cobain asserts, \"known only to a select group of men and women. And if necessary, Britain's use of torture would be concealed through statements by senior political figures that were the direct opposite of the truth.\"</p> <p>The result? Nothing much. The lack of outcry to the issues raised in Cobain's book speaks volumes.</p>",
  "<p>The research council chief who controversially tried to close down the British Antarctic Survey has been ordered to explain apparently inaccurate remarks to the Commons science select committee last week. MPs are concerned about the account given by Duncan Wingham, head of the Natural Environment Research Council, of personnel changes made at the BAS after preparations to close it were instigated this year.</p> <p>The closure plan \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/antarctic-base-ozone-government-cuts\" title=\"\"> first revealed by the Observer </a>\u2013 generated widespread hostility and was eventually abandoned last week. Wingham had tried to justify his council's plan to merge the survey with the National Oceanographic Centre in Southampton before MPs on Wednesday but was attacked for failing to justify the move on cost or scientific grounds; for failing to consult properly, and not taking into account the survey's geopolitical role in the South Atlantic. The next day, the NERC dropped the merger plan.</p> <p>The 60-year-old British Antarctic Survey, which has its HQ in Cambridge, operates five research stations, two ships and five aircraft in Antarctica. Breakthroughs made by its scientists have included the 1985 discovery of the hole in the ozone layer. However, its paymasters at NERC \u2013 which funds UK research on a wide range of environmental subjects \u2013 were told last year by the government to cut expenditure by 10% and capital spending by 45% by 2015. Polar research, which is costly, was chosen to take a major hit. The plan was greeted with outrage by scientists. Jonathan Shanklin, one of the researchers who discovered the ozone hole in 1985, said: \"The BAS is almost synonymous with the ozone hole. Losing it would create a comparable hole in British science.\"</p> <p>In the wake of this opposition, the select committee called senior NERC officials, including Wingham, to appear before it. The committee also noted that Wingham had claimed the current interim head of the survey, Professor Ed Hill, was not appointed until the previous director, his deputy and the head of corporate services had left. In fact, Hill was appointed before then. Andrew Miller, chair of the select committee, has demanded Wingham explain this inconsistency. \"The committee would like to better understand the events by which Professor Hill was appointed, particularly why he was a better choice than the deputy director,\" states Miller in a letter sent to Wingham on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>L\u00f6rrach, on the edge of the Black Forest, may be 700 miles away from Cadbury's historic home of Bournville, but it too can lay claim to a chocolate-making tradition dating back more than 100 years.</p> <p>The picture-postcard town is home to Milka, Germany's favourite chocolate bar; the factory gates are close enough to the Alps to receive milk from the herds grazing in the mountain meadows. Here too, a purple corporate livery is much in evidence \u2013 although Milka's art-nouveau lilac is of a distinctly lighter shade than Cadbury's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/oct/03/cadbury-trademark-colour-purple-open-thread\" title=\"\">now trademarked Pantone 2685C</a>. And both are now outposts of the sprawling Kraft global empire.</p> <p>Plant manager Peter Jungbeck says: \"L\u00f6rrach is like Bournville. They have been making chocolate for 170 years and we have been doing it for 130. The people are very proud that a brand like Milka is in their city.\" With 3m bars rolling off its production lines each day, Milka is the biggest local employer.</p> <p>Like Cadbury, it was once part of a family-run business, started by Swiss chocolatier Philippe Suchard, but it became part of Kraft following the 1990 takeover of Jacobs Suchard and is now one of its biggest brands, with annual sales of more than $1bn and spinoffs such as biscuits, cheese spread and hot chocolate. The Suchard name, in its classic gold embossed lettering, disappeared from the packets long ago.</p> <p>Cadbury was swallowed up by Kraft in 2010 after one of the hardest-fought takeovers in recent memory \u2013 but with the ink barely dry on the new stationery, it was all change again last month as the US group went ahead with a surprise demerger that saw more than 100 of its snack brands, including Cadbury, Milka, Toblerone and Oreo, spun off under the newly created banner of Mondelez International.</p> <p>The shakeup, unions fear, could spell change for 6,500 staff in the UK and Ireland, not least because factory workers are no longer protected by a pledge of no compulsory redundancies. The promise, which expired in March, was extracted from Kraft after it was called to account by parliament for reneging on the closure of the Cadbury plant at Somerdale near Bristol.</p> <p>Jennie Formby, national officer for food and drink industries at the union Unite, is concerned after 200 positions were cut at the end of last year: \"We never thought sites would close straight away, but there are certainly vulnerabilities \u2013 not just in the UK and Ireland but in the whole of&#xa0;Europe.\"</p> <p>At the Light Cube, a glass office block in Zurich, Mondelez's European head, Tim Cofer, met the press for the first time last week and waxed enthusiastic about the outlook for the month-old company \u2013 which, despite the split, is still the world's biggest chocolate and biscuit manufacturer with annual sales of $36bn.</p> <p>What was previously Kraft's European base is emblazoned with the company's garish new logo \u2013 also purple \u2013 and Cofer, a high-flier with the ear of group chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, insists the logic for the split was \"compelling\", creating two companies with different specialities and geographical footprints.</p> <p>But with 59 factories in Europe, the business is a jigsaw of assets amassed on an acquisition trail that has included Jacobs Suchard, Danone's biscuit arm Lef\u00e8vre-Utile (LU) \u2013 maker of classic French biscuits such as Petit Beurre \u2013 and most recently Cadbury. Cofer admits: \"There will be change over the coming years as we look for the most efficient network in the industry to support this snacking company. Our portfolio is too complicated, we have too many product lines and can unlock benefits from simplifying our portfolio.\"</p> <p>With nearly half its sales rung up in emerging markets, Cofer says Mondelez offers investors \"exposure to a higher growth profile\", and with eyes firmly on the demerger, he is eager to drive the corporate message home: \"This is not the old Kraft Foods \u2013 this is Mondelez International and we are a global company.\"</p> <p>The European business is also a big piece of the Mondelez pie, accounting for nearly 40% of sales, whereas North America, where it retains its listing, contributes less than a fifth of turnover.</p> <p>The opposite is true of the other half of the demerger, which will retain its original name. Kraft, famously described by one Cadbury descendant as that \"plastic cheese company\", will now account for turnover of around $19bn, having been left with a larder full of US grocery brands such as Miracle Whip, Jell-O and Kool-Aid.</p> <p>From Kraft's standpoint the \u00a311bn Cadbury deal was a good one, says Cofer, who led the integration: \"We are on track if not ahead of plan on everything we had hoped for. We created a business that grew faster than its separate parts.\" Costs as a percentage of sales decreased from 17.7% in 2009 to 14.2% in 2011 as savings made from bashing the two companies together were realised.</p> <p>Despite reports of mass defections, Cofer insists the group \"retained key talent\": former Cadbury executives Ruslan Kinebas and Andrew Gibson sit on the European leadership team while former UK managing director Trevor Bond is Cofer's counterpart in central and eastern Europe.</p> <p>\"We have legacy Cadbury folks leading categories, geographies and functions,\" he says, before stressing that it's not all about Cadbury. \"The same would apply for LU. On the sixth floor we have a fantastic collection of legacy LU folks. We are investing to bring together three legacy companies: Kraft, Cadbury and LU.\"</p> <p>But with the tax affairs of multinationals coming under increasing scrutiny, Kraft faced criticism when it shifted ownership of some of the UK companies to a Swiss holding company.</p> <p>There are \"many reasons\" to choose a Swiss base other than tax, insists Cofer, who says the company complies with \"all applicable tax legislation\" in the UK. \"Mondelez International pays corporation tax based on the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates,\" he says, adding that Kraft has had a Swiss base for more than 50 years. \"It's not a new 'hey let's go to Switzerland'. From a talent attraction standpoint, it's a great place to live. It's no hardship to live in Zurich.\"</p> <p>If British consumers are perturbed about the fate of Cadbury under its latest new ownership, they are not showing it. The latest Nielsen data put the brand's UK market share at 29%, up 0.2% on the previous year.</p> <p>\"Our market share in the UK with Cadbury Dairy Milk has hit a record high,\" says Cofer. \"In the end the British customer is voting with her pounds and voting quite favourably.\"</p>",
  "<p>How much has the extraordinary wave of hope that swept the world four years ago, when President Obama was inaugurated, been borne out by his first term in office?</p> <p>Why do I think it is so vital that he wins again this week, for America and for the world?</p> <p>Let's remember President Obama inherited a very deep hole, a hole most Americans did not imagine existed. When he came in, we had lost four million jobs in four years \u2013 800,000 jobs evaporated in January 2009 alone. Since that time, we have created five and a half million new jobs. That's more than 30 straight months of job growth in tough economic times. In addition, he had to confront banks that, through their greed, had forced record-breaking home foreclosures. The global economy \u2013 from the US to Europe and around the world \u2013 was at the point of total collapse. The banks were bailed out.</p> <p>The automotive industry had collapsed. Now, because of the Obama administration's policies to rescue the auto industry, we're the number one auto-producing nation again. Autoworkers are once more working three shifts and producing high yields. The auto industry is back, though Romney said: \"Let them go bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Furthermore, when President Obama came into office, we were caught in a war of choice \u2013 an immoral, bad choice \u2013 in Iraq. President Bush and Tony Blair dealt us a severe blow. The whole world was telling them not to wage war \u2013 I was speaking in London at Hyde Park on the day of the big <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/2765041.stm\" title=\"\">protest</a>. We told them there was no basis for going into Iraq. Since then, we have lost British and American lives, resources and honour, and they have not been humble enough to apologise. That war cost us trillions of dollars, which took us from a budget surplus to a budget deficit.</p> <p>Now we have left Iraq and the administration has implemented a plan to wind down the war in Afghanistan, which is coming to a close in terms of American involvement. Billions of dollars spent on war can now be redirected to jobs, investment and economic development at home.</p> <p>There's a lot more we must do to be seen as leading the world by right. We have become addicted to leading by might and it takes some time to restore confidence and credibility. We're not there yet but we're moving in the right direction.</p> <p>So yes, when President Obama took office, the US and the world were in a deep, dark economic (and political) hole. But now we are moving through fields towards the mountaintop. Though we've yet to reach that point, the arrows are pointing in the right direction \u2013 jobs, industry, healthcare cover all on the rise, wars on the decline.</p> <p>Romney and the conservatives have derided the comprehensive health care plan as \"Obamacare.\" But the truth is that Obama does care. People would be dead without health insurance. And young people benefit as they can stay on their parents' health plans into their 20s. The insurance companies were charging higher and higher fees for ever lower cover and they claimed the right not to insure people. Obama broke up that kind of exploitative behaviour and today 30 million more Americans are covered. Obama's historic healthcare legislation will stand the test of time.</p> <p>And all of this achieved despite the attempt by the Republicans&#xa0;to demean the president.&#xa0;They called him a liar. They said that he's not an American, he's not a Christian, he's illegitimate.</p> <p>Romney offers no positive alternative for America. We are currently in the throes of a weather crisis, hurricane Sandy, which has wreaked havoc on the east coast. Railroads, subways, roads, bridges, houses, banks, whole communities have been devastated. Romney once said we don't need Fema, the federal government agency now co-ordinating the rescue and recovery programme related to these disasters. He says \"state authorities\" (not the federal government) should handle that devastation \u2013 and private investors.</p> <p>The fact is a state alone cannot handle such problems. And&#xa0;private investors should not be profiting out of such misery. It's the role of&#xa0;central government to be a part of the emergency repair and to be a part of the clean-up and reconstruction. Because of an act of nature, there must now be a massive investment in infrastructure. It will create jobs and contracts, new technology as well as other scientific advances.</p> <p>President Obama had made the case for that before the disaster \u2013 for the need to invest in infrastructure, in roads, buildings and bridges, to reinvest in America to put Americans back to work. Now that he's leading us in this crisis, even his adversaries are saying he's doing a good job. &#xa0;The president's leadership during hurricane Sandy is steady and confident.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/18/obama-inauguration-obama-white-house\" title=\"\">I said in an article in the <em>Observer</em> four years ago that Barack Obama's inauguration</a> was a magnificent moment in a five-decades-long race for civil rights in America and in the world as a whole. Has his first term&#xa0;stood up to the extraordinary hope he inspired? For black Americans, a ceiling has been removed. An African American, a woman or a Latino can&#xa0;now believe that their path through life will carry them as far as their dreams can imagine. If Obama can do it, it inspires women to think they can do it and Latinos to think they can do it. So the barrier to our dreams has been removed.</p> <p>But you cannot have racial reconciliation unless you have racial justice. Our <a href=\"http://www.rainbowpush.org/\" title=\"\">Rainbow</a> friends in the UK call it Equanomics \u2013 racial equality and economic justice. Black people are still facing tremendous racial injustice; we're number one in home foreclosure; the banks target us. We're number one in infant mortality. Number one in short life expectancy. Number one in unemployment. We're still very much on the margins.</p> <p>A few have done well enough to become symbolic examples. You look at Colin Powell, you look at Oprah and you look at some great athletes. But you can't measure the progress of the masses of black Americans by the symbolic value of extraordinary achievers. It's like swimming the English Channel. It's not the distance that makes it difficult to swim \u2013 it's the undercurrent. That's what we're struggling against \u2013 an undercurrent based on centuries of enslavement, institutional race inequalities and unfounded fears.</p> <p>I look at America embracing&#xa0;Olympic&#xa0;medallists, black and white; embracing the impact of black music upon the culture. You'd think those achievements would have brought more reconciliation. But we seem to be cherry-picking \u2013 selectively recognising black success while still disregarding racial injustice.</p> <p>The scar on America's soul is racial injustice. It is the key to equality, workers' rights, children's rights, environmental security and ending war. So how this issue is handled is the key to the salvation of our nation. Martin Luther King would say that the pursuit of racial justice is the way to redeem the soul of America. President Obama's achievement can only be seen as part of&#xa0;a long battle for civil rights. What one must appreciate is that his ascendancy is a long journey that can be traced in modern history He did not come to us unilaterally. He came out of a 64-year process. In 1948, President Truman ended military racial segregation. The Supreme Court knocked down decades of legal segregation in the Brown v Board of Education decision. We won a big victory in 1955 with the Montgomery bus boycott, after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white person, leading to the end of segregation by 1964. We won the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/1964_civil_rights_act.htm\" title=\"\">1964 Civil Rights Act</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/vot/intro/intro_b.php\" title=\"\">1965 Voting Rights Act, e</a>nding discrimination at elections. We staged the anti-Vietnam war protests. From 1948 to 2008, there were 60 years of victories: overcoming obstacles, removing walls, pulling down barriers. Obama comes out of that process. &#xa0;He's a result of the &#xa0;years of struggle. He is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. He ran a fast, able leg of the race we're in. He is a member of a team.</p> <p>So has the issue of race in American politics been transformed for all time? &#xa0;Absolutely not. The forces of hostility have in a strange way been reinvigorated, their fears have been revived, their anger has been rekindled, the mean spirits have resurged. America has a deep-seated commitment to unfounded racial fears and, win or lose, those fears will not go away.</p> <p>There are attempts to take the civil rights victories back. Our opponents are fighting the civil war of 1865. They're trying to pit states' rights against a more perfect union, the federal government. If Obama loses, they'll be empowered to undermine years of work. &#xa0;If Romney wins and puts right-wingers on the Supreme Court, the courts could rule to undermine the entire movement made by Dr King. Who appoints the next Supreme Court justices will determine the next 50 years of America. &#xa0;</p> <p>The scale of the president's achievement is not just a matter of his complexion, but the direction in which he has tried to take the country. He has done a huge amount, but a unified America could have achieved twice as much. Instead, the Republicans have been planning how to make him a one-term president since the time of his inauguration in January 2009. Their mission was not about job creation, bank reconstruction or to revive manufacturing. Their mission was not to rebuild. Their mission was at all costs to undermine his authority. &#xa0;</p> <p>If the president wins, conservative right-wingers will not stop fighting ideologically. &#xa0;We must maintain our struggle to prevail. We need to keep taking the nation forward by hope and never backward by fear. We need to keep hope alive.</p>",
  "<p>Devastating tropical storms of the kind that<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/nov/02/superstorm-sandy-nasa-timelapse-video\" title=\"\"> battered the US last week</a> could be weakened and rendered less deadly using a simple and cheap technology based on a surprising component \u2013 old car tyres.</p> <p>One of Britain's leading marine engineers, Stephen Salter, emeritus professor of engineering design at Edinburgh university and a global pioneer of wave power research, has patented with Microsoft billionaires Bill Gates and Nathan Myhrvold the idea of using thousands of tyres lashed together to support giant plastic tubes which extend 100m deep into the ocean.</p> <p>Wave action on the ocean surface would force warm surface water down into the deeper ocean. If non-return valves were used, he says, the result would be to mix the waters and cool the surface temperature of the ocean to under 26.5C, the critical temperature at which hurricanes form.</p> <p>According to Salter, who has written to the government's chief scientific officer setting out his scheme, harnessing energy from the waves to cool the surface temperature of the ocean makes ecological sense. The naturally working pumps would be located in \"hurricane alley\", the warm corridor in the Atlantic through which the most damaging storms typically develop and pass.</p> <p>Salter claims that the hydrological problems have been solved but that research funding is urgently needed. \"If you can cool the sea surface, you would calm the hurricanes. I estimate you would need about 150-450 of these structures. They would drift around and send out radar signals so that no one would collide with them,\" he said.</p> <p>The idea of what is now known as the \"Salter Sink\" was first presented to the US government in 2007 at a post-Katrina US Homeland Security meeting on hurricane suppression. It was picked up and developed by Intellectual Ventures, a Seattle-based new tech company run by Myhrvold and backed by Gates which buys and licenses patents and inventions.</p> <p>\"The Salter Sink concept is delightfully simple and singularly gargantuan,\" the company said in a statement posted on its website . \"It has captured our imagination here in the lab. We have done some experiments and computational modelling work to validate this idea, but a lot more research needs to be done by experts in related fields such as climate science and oceanography, and we need partners to pursue the project further.\"</p> <p>Research into hurricane suppression is considered urgent by the US government because seven of the 10 costliest hurricanes to hit the United States have struck since 2004. Hurricane Sandy has caused approximately $30bn of damage, taking the economic costs of hurricanes in the US and Caribbean since 2002 to more than $200bn.</p> <p>Salter's research is unlikely to be funded by the British government, which is traditionally shy of paying for \"blue sky\" marine technologies, and Salter's own wave devices in particular.</p> <p>In 1982 Salter invented the idea of a mechanical \"duck\" which bobbed on the ocean and generated electricity. But the government shut down the UK Wave Energy programme, arguing that his invention would be too expensive to develop further.</p> <p>It emerged later that civil servants in the nuclear power division of the energy department had \"miscalculated\" by a factor of 10 the estimated cost of energy production, possibly setting back British wave energy research by 20 years.</p> <p>Salter, with John Lathan of the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research, has also developed the idea of using hundreds of ships spraying very fine seawater droplets high into the sky to reflect sunlight and thus counter global warming and suppress hurricanes. The UK government was asked to assess the technology research, but declined to back it financially.</p> <p>Hurricane suppression ideas go back more than 100 years but attempts have mostly proved tragicomic, said Jim Fleming, author of a new history of geo-engineering. Ideas have included setting up rows of cannon on the Florida coast to shoot them down; using laser beams from space; and \"seeding\" them with silver iodide.</p> <p>The results have proved at best uncertain. One hurricane \"manipulated\" by the US government in the 1940s veered off course and struck Georgia, causing $20m of damage and killing two people. In 1962, just after the Cuban missile crisis, Fidel Castro complained that the US had \"modified\" a hurricane which, remarkably, lingered over the island for four days after exercising a U-turn.</p> <p>Many countries, including the US and Russia, have tried to militarise weather research, trying to divert hurricanes and storms into the path of their enemies.</p> <p>Salter was inspired to invent his device after seeing the damage wrought by Katrina.</p>",
  "<p>It's 9am on a lovely autumn morning at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, just outside Geneva. The sun shines on to an open vista of fields and mountains, glistens off nearby lakes. It's an ideal day for cycling, walking, picnicking; almost anything other than messing around with computers in the dark.</p> <p>I am standing in the dark, watching people mess around with computers. Scruffy young men take cables out of plastic carrier bags and plug them into the back of television screens. They connect up keyboards, slot in SD cards, bung long leads into USB jacks. Parcel tape is slathered over stray cords to stick them in place. Somehow, I thought that Cern, the closest thing to a Bond lab on the planet, would be more sophisticated than this.</p> <p>Still, it's not Cern that we're checking out. We're here for something far more basic, and even more exciting. Take a closer look.</p> <p>You will notice that near every terminal sits a small green circuit board. Slightly bigger than a credit card, with cables sprouting out of it like twisted limbs, it resembles a rectangular spider. In fact, it's a computer, busily driving and connecting all the disparate elements around it to create\u2026 well, whatever the geeks want it to. Say hello, ladies and gentle-nerds, to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/raspberry-pi\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi is a robust, cheap (about \u00a325), low-powered programmable computer. It is a British invention that went on sale for the first time in February this year and has been a science sensation, the computing equivalent of tickets to Glastonbury or the Rolling Stones: everyone wants one, not just hardcore fans. Before it even launched, demand for the Pi outran supply, and the day the first 10,000 became available, the distributing websites all crashed. The first ever BBC online video of the RPi \u2013 a preview of it, before it went on sale \u2013 got more than 800,000 views in a matter of days. Since then, the RPi has shifted almost 500,000 units and is on target to top 1m by Christmas \u2013 topped up by purchasers from South America and China who haven't been put off by the import costs which turn the RPi from bargain to just cheapish. It's been used to take photographs of the Earth from near space and snaps of birds in back gardens. And it has united the science community, from primary school teachers to particle physicists, in joyous enthusiasm; mostly because they hope its price, size, software and sturdiness (you can shove it in your pocket without damaging it, supposedly) will make it appeal to kids, and thus lead children into computer programming.</p> <p>So let's see, shall we? From 9am until 5pm, an unremitting stream of young kids wander into the dim room at Cern, look around for a free monitor, and sit down in front of it. They spot a small cat in the right hand top corner of the screen. Someone \u2013 an adult, another child \u2013 tells them they can make the cat move if they program it to do so. And then the kids do so.</p> <p>Mickal, who's six, is as charming an advert for the RPi as you will ever meet. \"Watch the cat,\" he says. \"He can dance.\" He drags and drops commands across the screen. The cat walks and turns around in circles. Later, he shows me that he can switch some tiny lights on and off using the RPi. \"Press N and enter,\" he says. \"Now N, space and enter.\"</p> <p>Nancy, seven, is also enjoying herself. She's given the cat a friend, a horse who makes odd noises, gallops into walls and bounces back. \"We don't have a computer at school, except sometimes for maths. I don't play computer at home either. I like drawing. And I like this.\"</p> <p>Nearby, Thomas, seven, is having a go too. Is he enjoying himself? \"I like it a little bit,\" he says. \"It's fun, but sometimes when you get a bit stuck, it gets annoying, and you want to do something else.\" He looks a little wistfully at the door, and at the bright sunshine beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398873310\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/11/2/1351876984854/Raspberry-Pi-001.jpg\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi\" width=\"220\" height=\"127\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Six-year-old Mickal and his father show Miranda Sawyer a few of the Raspberry Pi\u2019s tricks at the Cern programming event.

Its developers are six highly qualified Cambridge-based scientists, and its principles are pure of heart. The <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> is a charity whose sole aim is to promote the study of computer science in schools; the Raspberry Pi was born from that aim. If the foundation had been a business rather than a charity, the original six could have retired by now.</p> <p>The geek buzz around the RPi \u2013 let's not forget it's been around less than a year \u2013 has been phenomenal. Now there are events like the one at Cern held all over the place: Manchester, Machynlleth, Silicon Valley, Singapore. Called Raspberry jams (do you see?), and not officially endorsed by the foundation, they're essentially just local people getting together and sharing knowledge about the RPi. Here at Cern, on the Swiss-French border, organiser Dr William Bell is concerned with the lack of computer science in local schools (his kids attend a French primary which, at the moment, doesn't have a working computer for the children to use). Thus his jam involves teachers, kids and parents. Others have been more grown up, with lectures and demonstrations, people standing in front of large screens, making jokes in computer code.</p> <p>The jams are just one of the RPi-inspired offshoots that have sprung up since the launch. The point of the RPi is that, contrary to most of today's computers, it doesn't come bundled with everything you require. To make it work, you need a keyboard, a screen, an SD memory card, a vast array of cables\u2026 So RPi packages have become available, enabling you to buy all those accessories in one go. And if you don't want to program the operating system on to the memory card, there are pre-programmed ones available. If you don't like the idea of it knocking about without a case, several people have designed those.</p> <p>More interestingly, there are now add-on boards that expand the Pi's capabilities, to make it easier to use for physical computing and give it functions like driving motors, making lights flash, turning your Lego man into an actual moving robot. These include the Gertboard, designed by a member of the Raspberry Pi Foundation team (called Gert). And <a href=\"http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm\" title=\"\">Pi-Face</a>, which is similar, though slightly easier to use (no soldering required), and is the baby of Dr Andrew Robinson of Manchester University.</p> <p>Robinson, a friendly, funny man, tells me about the bird box some of his students have designed using an RPi and Pi-Face; the box has an infrared light beam, so the RPi knows when a bird is coming in and out and can activate a camera or send you a message. Robinson also uses his RPi outside work; at the moment he has one at the centre of a theatre show. The RPi syncs interactive projections with lighting and sound, which all respond to the movements of the dancers.</p> <p>What else? Manchester University is running the Great British Raspberry Pi Bake Off, a competition for kids to design an exciting use for the RPi; it's sending out RPis and Pi-Faces to the developing world, places like Bangalore and Kenya, where the RPi has caused a sensation but has been hard to come by. \"I don't think the Pi is going to change the world,\" says Robinson. \"But it has opened stuff up, and created an excitement around programming that I've never seen before.\"</p> <p>The creators of the RPi are of a generation that played <em>with</em>, rather than o<em>n</em>, computers. Their first consoles were BBC Micros, Commodore 64s, Spectrum ZXs: beige boxes with limited power that offered limited built-in entertainment. In order to really enjoy yourself, you had to tinker about with what your computer could do: change some of the coding and see what happened. If you could do that, you could bring that programming skill to any other computer. But once computers improved, became more powerful and better to play games on, they became harder to program. The tinkering aspect was lost, and this affected swaths of schoolchildren: they just didn't come into contact with programming, even though they had more access to computers, better games consoles, lessons in ICT.</p> <p>Eben Upton, a friendly, upbeat man (everyone involved with the RPi is friendly) is a designer of microchips for <a href=\"http://www.broadcom.com/\" title=\"\">Broadcom</a> and the main designer of the RPi. In the early- to mid-2000s, he was in charge of undergraduate admissions to computer science at Cambridge. He noticed a massive drop-off in the numbers and, especially, quality of undergraduates between 1996, when he graduated, and 2005.</p> <p>\"The students just couldn't program, and that's because they hadn't been in the presence of programmable hardware,\" he says. \"It's not so much an education as an environment thing. I was self-taught, so were all of my friends. But in the consumer device world we're in today, where the majority of devices are tablets and phones and set-top boxes and games consoles\u2026 these are all machines that you can use to consume, but most of them won't let you produce.\"</p> <p>Everyone I speak to about the RPi is insistent that anyone can code, whether or not you're good at maths. Bell, at Cern, says it's like messing around with a motorbike. \"You spend your time taking it apart, putting it back together. Only by doing that will you understand how the engine works.\"</p> <p>Upton defines programming as \"breaking problems down into manageable pieces\", and the RPi, when you boot it up, has a couple of programming languages already in place: Scratch, which is the basic one with the cat, and the more sophisticated Python, which, once you've mastered it, leads you to pretty much any programming language you want. \"The Pi isn't just a magic box that does stuff,\" says Eben. \"You can start Python, enter six letters and straight away, you're in a programming environment.\"</p> <p>All of which sounds terrific, and terrifically exciting. Modern kids love computers, so why wouldn't they love programming? Well\u2026 The most identifiable characteristic of the computing genius is that he (it's usually a he) is Other. In the new Bond film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall</em></a>, Ben Wishaw's Q is as cute as can be, with his specs and wayward fringe, but he is, essentially, the lofty opposite of hero Bond. Q sits in a dark room looking at a screen; Bond runs around hitting people and snogging.</p> <p>This divide isn't new; it's in every school you go to. The nerds hang in the computer room during break time and make obscure jokes; the jocks run around hitting things and trying to chat up girls. There are other cliques \u2013 those who cluster in the art room, the alternative music crew \u2013 but it seems to me that, admirable though the foundation's intentions are, they'll find it hard to convince many teenagers that programming is for anyone other than geeks. Even if they do get RPis in there early.</p> <p>Eben admits that this is something he and his compadres think about a lot. He (and the rest of the foundation) is aware that, so far, about 80% of RPis have been sold \"to geeks like me\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398873311\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/11/2/1351876106322/Raspberry-Pi-011.jpg\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi\" width=\"220\" height=\"327\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Raspberry Pi was designed to be cheap enough that all youngsters might have a chance to learn programming. Photograph: Phil Fisk for the Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"We don't want to end up entrenching all the advantages that are already there,\" he says. \"There is a fixed-size pie \u2013 sorry, but it's the best word \u2013 which consists of white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. Let's say that pie is divided up into particle physicists, investment bankers and computer scientists, which are all careers that are dominated by white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. If you're not careful, then all you're doing is moving the dividers around that pie of people. What we need to do is expand the pie itself.\"</p> <p>In his day job, designing computer chips at Broadcom, Upton insists that he doesn't use a tremendous amount of maths: \"My job is more of a craft.\" And he thinks that emphasising the craft element of programming might help with that stubbornly non-expanding pie \u2013 particularly with girls. What the Raspberry Pi Foundation doesn't want to do is what he calls \"painting it pink\" \u2013 meaning trying to appeal to girls in a trivial way.</p> <p>There's another pie-growing aspect, he thinks, within the vast sector of teenage boys who love computer games. \"There are loads of boys between 12 and 16 who would love to step up to the next level and actually create their own games. But there's no obvious route, and I say that as someone who set up a computer games company straight out of university.\" Now, he would just tell such lads to go and get an RPi, play around with it for a couple of years and then take their portfolio to a games company.</p> <p>Another tricky thing about the Raspberry Pi is teaching. It has been pretty convincingly proven that the ICT classes of the 1990s did nothing much more than produce students who would make good secretaries; today's emphasis on online isn't useful either. (As Eben puts is: \"The not particularly helpful skill that students have has changed from being able to use PowerPoint to being able to build a website.\") But how can teachers teach students computer programming if they don't know how to do it themselves?</p> <p>\"It's ridiculous to ask teachers to teach stuff they don't feel confident about,\" agrees Eben. \"We need to make teachers feel comfortable.\" Yet, he admits, if teachers are trained to be great programmers, then they'll just leave teaching and go and earn loads more money. \"So we have to find a way to make this stuff deliverable by non-specialists.\" To this end, the foundation \u2013 along with many other associations, such as <a href=\"http://www.codeclub.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Code Club</a> \u2013 has been encouraging computer engineers to help enthusiastic teachers set up after-school&#xa0;clubs.</p> <p>And what about parents? I'm white, female, middle class and studied maths and further maths (not very well) at A-level: I wouldn't have a clue what to do if my kid came to me with a programming problem. Upton admits that here, too, the RPi isn't perfect, yet.</p> <p>\"At the moment, we can deliver a really satisfying educational experience in a supervised environment, say where an adult or older child who really knows about computing is looking over a young child who doesn't. The real challenge is delivering to people like you, people who aren't natural-born computer programmers who can answer every question a kid has without even thinking about it. The Pi has to work in a computer-phobic environment. I think it's doable. And it's absolutely key.\"</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi isn't perfect, but that's a decision made by its creators. As much as it can be, the RPi is open: its software is open, and so is its attitude \u2013 unlike, say the closed, smooth perfection of Apple. The RPi's creators welcome suggestions, and understand that this is a work in progress that can only be moved along by the contributions of other enthusiasts.\"</p> <p>Upton tells me to wait a few months before buying an RPi, because in that time, the foundation will overhaul the software that comes bundled with it, especially Scratch, so that it is faster and more stable. (They've already put more RAM into the RPi, increasing it to 512MB; and recently announced that every piece of RPi software is now open source, meaning unhidden and accessible.) Also \u2013 and this seems key to me \u2013 RPi will be bringing out teaching materials.</p> <p>In the end, though, you can lead kids to the RPi, but you can't make them all code. And that's fine. Because some will become obsessed. One of the many, many online videos on RPi was made by George, nine, who has a blog called <a href=\"http://talkietoaster.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">My Journey With Java</a>. He made it in August and it shows him putting leads into his RPi and talking through what each one does. As he puts in the power cable, he breaks off a shiny silver part of the Pi. If George were my child, I'd hand him some Blu-Tak. George just tweets the video to the Pi Foundation and they get back to him and tell him what to do.</p>",
  "<p>An independent British film company has won funding for six productions with a combined budget of $155m (\u00a396m), the <em>Observer</em> can reveal.</p> <p>The company's financial model is unusual in that investors are offered all six movies, spreading the risk significantly beyond the usual single film, and with a \"transparency\" that seeks to reassure investors stung by notorious abuses of tax schemes involving film investment.</p> <p>The producer, Miriam Segal, has a track record that includes the award-winning <em>Love is the Devil</em>, with Derek Jacobi as artist Francis Bacon, and <em>Good</em>, CP Taylor's Nazi drama with Oscar-nominated Viggo Mortensen.</p> <p>One of the films, a \u00a321m production entitled <em>The Infiltrator</em>, features a story of greed and deception surrounding the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International amid fraud allegations. \"It's 23 years old now, but has great contemporary resonance,\" she said. Others include a murder story, a drama about economic migrants, and an urban thriller with budgets of \u00a315m, \u00a38m and \u00a311m. \"Anything over \u00a39m outside a studio is a big thing in Britain,\" Segal said. Although a company such as Working Title, whose films include <em>Notting Hill</em>, also has a slate, they are backed by Universal, the US film giant.</p> <p>She plans to make \"intelligent but commercial feature films\", emulating the US independent model and shying away from more traditional \"British fare\" with \"too many films that three men and their dog will go and see\".</p> <p>Her announcement follows reports that HM Revenue &amp; Customs is investigating film schemes that exploit loopholes, which has rocked the confidence of investors who have also lost huge amounts of money.</p> <p>Her \"blueprint model\" involves the same sales agent, bank and equity source for all six films. Six UK-based businessmen have already ploughed \u00a32.5m just into developing the films.</p> <p>She said the Revenue has indicated preliminary approval for her tax model for its proper use of the Enterprise Investment Scheme, designed to help higher-risk business to raise funds. Investors will enjoy tax relief, but she said the model eliminates brokers, who in other film schemes were \"really\" selling just tax benefits.</p> <p>Segal said that investors are the lifeblood of independent filmmaking, but too many have been encouraged to invest unwisely. She said many potential investors say \"'Why the hell should I believe you, I've been so screwed in the past.\"</p> <p>\"But there are people trying to make films for the right reasons,\" she said. \"We're not all a bunch of shysters,\" she added. \"We're creating employment and economic investment. Our primary job is to protect their investment, not rip them off.\"</p> <p>Martin Rushton-Turner, founding investor and tax expert, said it means that these productions have been properly developed, unlike most independent films which are \"done on a hope and a prayer\".</p> <p>Scripts are already written, budgets worked out and they already have commitments from banks and the sales agent who will sell distribution rights, he said, noting that investors' money will only get drawn down when the banks give the green light for funding. They expect to raise 10% \u2013 up to \u00a310m \u2013 from investors, averaging \u00a3250,000 each, and the rest from the bank and distribution sales. He added: \"I have a tax background, so I'm pretty familiar with the uses and abuses of structured finance for tax. This is as good as you can get.\"News of the films was welcomed by Adrian Wootton, chief executive of Film London and the British Film Commission. Although he has yet to see details, he said: \"If they've managed to put together a slate like that with independent financing\u2026 it sounds very exciting.\"</p>",
  "<p>When those madcap Scandinavian satirists awarded the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19921072\" title=\"\">Nobel peace prize to the European Union</a>, they let everyone in on the joke by praising its commitment to \"reconciliation, democracy and human rights\". If the committee's 2012 citation were anything other than a spoof, you would have read denunciations of the rise of oppressive state power and neo-Nazism in Greece from concerned Euro commissioners long before now.</p> <p>The EU denounces threats to freedom of speech in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16390574\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a>'s Hungary with vigour. European politicians worry with good reason about the fate of independent institutions that stand in the way of the rabble-rousing regime. They notice the fascistic element in the new Hungarian right's flirtations with antisemitic and anti-Roma hatreds and its willingness to indulge the revanchist fantasy that Hungary can regain the lands it lost after the First World War. On the fate of Greek democracy there is silence, however, although there is much that Europe's leaders might talk about.</p> <p>You spot the pressure points of a failing state by looking at what it censors. In the case of Greece, the authorities' prosecution last week of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/greek-editor-kostas-vaevanis-acquitted\" title=\"\">Kostas Vaxevanis</a> showed that he had hit a pressure point with the accuracy of a doctor sticking a needle into a nerve. While Greeks live with austerity without end, while Greek GDP has shrunk by 4.5% in 2010 and 6.9% in 2011, and will shrink by a predicted 6.5% this year and 4.5% in 2013, the list of the names of 2,000 Greeks with bank accounts in Switzerland Vaxevanis published, suggested that the well-connected were escaping the burdens that fall on the masses.</p> <p>\"Instead of arresting the tax evaders and the ministers who had the list in their hands,\" thundered Vaxevanis in a call to arms that stirred the blood, \"they're trying to arrest the truth and freedom of the press.\"</p> <p>His acquittal on privacy law charges, though welcome, was less important than it appeared. It did not mean that freedom of the press was secure in Greece. Even in good times, independent journalism has rarely been a force in the land. Most Greek TV stations and newspapers are owned by either the state or plutocratic corporations, neither of which likes seeing corruption exposed. The leftwing daily, <em>Eleftherotypia</em>, which for all its faults and flirtations with terrorism at least challenged the oligarchs, filed for bankruptcy last year.</p> <p>Few of the employees of the remaining Greek news organisations reject the notion that they should keep quiet in the interests of holding on to their pay cheques. The state is hounding too many of those who do. \"We still have freedom of expression recognised by the law at a theoretical level,\" said Asteris Masouras, one of the free speech monitors at <a href=\"http://globalvoicesonline.org/\" title=\"\">Global Voices</a>. \"On a practical level, well...\" And he proceeded to give me a list of instances of menacing forces intimidating reporters that would go on into the New Review section if I ran it in full.</p> <p>Where to begin? How about the self-defeating austerity policies the troika of the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund have forced on Greece? The authorities used an old warrant to arrest <a href=\"http://www.indexoncensorship.org/tag/spiros-karatzaferis/\" title=\"\">Spiros Karatzaferis</a>, after the journalist threatened to reveal confidential emails, that might have explained how the troika's alleged \"rescue package\" had pushed the country into depression.</p> <p>Police brutality is another pressure point, undoubtedly. The Greek left makes persistent allegations of collaboration between the supposed forces of law and order and the thugs in the neo-Nazi <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/golden-dawn-infiltrated-greek-police-claims\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn </a>movement. The <em>Guardian</em> ran reports that the police had beaten up anti-fascist demonstrators after they had confronted Golden Dawn. Yes, I know leftists call everyone \"fascists\" from headteachers to their mums and dads, but as Golden Dawn is building a mass movement while marching under a swastika, the term is correct on this occasion. The following day, Greek state TV replaced <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/336001\" title=\"\">Kostas Arvanitis and Marilena Katsimi</a>, the presenters of its morning news show, after they told managers they planned to follow up the <em>Guardian</em>'s claims. Another state TV reporter, Christos Dantis, has joined the ranks of the vanishing journalists. His editors assigned him to cover the celebrations of the centenary of the liberation of Thessaloniki from Ottoman rule. He was about to report on popular protests against the presence of the Greek prime minister and president in Greece's second city when his masters turned off the camera and cut to a more amenable hack.</p> <p>All the Greek journalists I spoke to emphasised that Athens was not Beijing or Tehran, but they described how the liberal certainties they once held now appeared flimsy. Helena Smith, our superb Athens correspondent, says that she feels as if she is standing on shifting sands. If the centrist coalition fails, and the troika's punitive demands have condemned it to failure, then the left opposition in Syrzia will probably take over. After that, Golden Dawn, maybe? No one knows. Nothing is unthinkable in a climate of fear and hopelessness.</p> <p>One can say with certainty that old alliances between extreme political and extreme religious movements are reviving. Hence, last month Christian fanatics and neo-Nazis (and the difference between the two is fine) protested against a \"blasphemous\" play with a homosexual theme in Athens. The theatre's management duly pulled it. Greek television cut a scene from <em>Downton Abbey</em> that featured a gay kiss. No one can explain why but a country that censors <em>Downton Abbey</em> on any grounds other than literary taste is in grave trouble.</p> <p>British Eurosceptics do not understand that the European Union once offered an escape to a liberal future for the peoples of Europe. When I visited Athens in the early 1980s, the old could remember fighting the Nazi occupation and the young had grown up in and on occasion fought the military dictatorship the colonels imposed. Joining the European Union meant saying goodbye to all of that. Now poverty, fear, suppression and state intimidation are back.</p> <p>You can blame the corruption Greek society tolerated. You can blame the bankers for the crash. But you must also apportion blame to Europe's politicians and bureaucrats who accepted Greece (and the rest of southern Europe) into a single currency area that has put them at a permanent competitive disadvantage and refused to write off debts Greece can never repay.</p> <p>No wonder they stay silent about the abuse of the human rights the Nobel prize committee insisted European integration guaranteed. Greece is the Eurocrats' very own Weimar on the Aegean. They helped build it.</p>",
  "<p><strong>In a world of polished computers, the Raspberry Pi has arrived to remind us that, with nothing more than time, patience and an exposed circuit board, you can create almost anything. Here are a few of the projects RPi pioneers have devised over the past year.</strong></p> <h2><strong>1. NIXIE CLOCK</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711759\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769832804/pi-projects---nixie-clock-002.jpg\" alt=\"pi projects - nixie clock\" width=\"460\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">nixieclock.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: nixieclock.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a self-assembly <a href=\"http://www.nixieclock.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nixie Clock kit</a> (or digital clock capable of accepting GPS or microcontroller data), a Wi-Fi dongle or ethernet cable.</p> <p>Nixie tube clocks, with their neon digits, are popular with nostalgic electronics fans. One such enthusiast, Martin Oldfield, has built a clock that receives Network Time Protocol data from the internet via the RPi, and is accurate to ten-thousandths of a second. <a href=\"http://mjo.tc/atelier/2012/08/ntp-nixie.html\" title=\"\">Online instructions:</a> mjo.tc/atelier/2012/08/ntp-nixie. html</p> <p><strong>Difficulty: 4</strong></p> <h2><strong>2. ROBOT SLAVE</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, and (for a voice-recognition robot) a USB robotic arm, a USB microphone, a USB hub and voice-recognition software such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_(software)\" title=\"\">Julius</a>.</p> <p>Robots are a talking point across the RPi forums. One precocious aerospace engineer has used an RPi to run a voice-recognition program and now has a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U_v9tRD68k\" title=\"\">robotic arm</a> literally at his command, while another developer has built <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PiC0Mp8u4A\" title=\"\">\"Roberta\"</a>, a highly sophisticated two-wheeled RPi robot who perpetually responds to gyroscopes to balance herself.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>8-10</strong></p> <h2><strong>3. WEATHER STATION</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a home weather-station, a monitor and a USB cable.</p> <p>Britain's amateur meteorologists are already using the RPi to process weather data, highlighting once again the immediate, perhaps unsurprising proclivity felt by the hobbyist community for the tiny computer. With the RPi, having a single computer dedicated to a weather station is neither extravagant nor physically awkward, and several <a href=\"http://www.weather.dragontail.co.uk/index.php?page=station_setup\" title=\"\">tutorials</a> already exist to explain the necessary coding to prepare a web-accessible, personalised weather forecast.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>3</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>4. ROCKET LAUNCHER</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711760\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769573283/pi-projects---rocket-laun-001.jpg\" alt=\"pi projects - rocket launcher\" width=\"150\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">dreamcheeky.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dreamcheeky.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a powered USB hub, a USB rocket launcher.</p> <p>This invention is designed to intimidate and humiliate co-workers who make mistakes while writing code. When set up in an office environment, the RPi detects errors in software development and automatically fires a foam missile at the offending employee. The program, nicknamed Retaliation, is described by its creator as working on \"a deep psychological level to offer productivity improvements\". Its <a href=\"http://itr8r.tumblr.com/post/31840231144/raspberry-pi-retaliation\" title=\"\">credentials</a> are listed online, with a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EGk2rvZe8A\" title=\"\">video</a> showing it in action.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>4</strong></p> <h2><strong>5. PORTABLE/IN-CAR PC</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, an adapted power supply to run off a dashboard cigarette lighter or a battery pack and a small monitor.</p> <p>It is said that Julian Assange used to travel with a desktop PC in his rucksack. He could have done with the RPi, which weighs 45g (1.6oz) and can be adapted to function as a portable or in-car computer. One motorist has already linked up his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSTCdjA82fg\" title=\"\">RPi to a nifty sliding screen</a>, and several others are working on ways of accessorising their dashboards to incorporate RPi-run GPS and media systems.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>2-7</strong></p> <h2><strong>6. JUKEBOX</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a mini-speaker, a powered USB hub, a USB battery, various free media software.</p> <p>The giddy hope of building an iPod replacement from an RPi has yet to be completely realised, but a French computer science lecturer named Tarek Ziad\u00e9 has designed a portable, self-contained jukebox which can be controlled remotely from other computers. His <a href=\"http://blog.ziade.org/2012/07/01/a-raspberry-pi-juke-box-how-to/\" title=\"\">website</a> dispenses coding tips so the end product can run smoothly, and he has built a Lego case to contain the components.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>7</strong></p> <h2><strong>7. RADIO</strong></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a USB Wi-Fi adapter, various free media software, a battery-powered speaker and an Adafruit \"Cobbler\" (see glossary, right below).</p> <p>The proliferation of internet radio stations allows those with even the most outlandish music tastes to find their fellows out there in cyberspace. One exhaustive blogger named contractorwolf has built a successful RPi radio which shuffles between his favourite stations at the touch of a button. Hearteningly, he had no experience of programming in Linux before he built his radio so there is hope for the rest of us.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>6</strong></p> <h2><strong>8. ARCADE GAME</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a monitor, a cabinet to contain them, gaming software.</p> <p>Shea Silverman of Florida has demonstrated his love of vintage video games by building an RPi into a miniature replica of an arcade game circa 1991, complete with a fully functioning version of <em>Street Fighter II</em>. Thousands of old arcade games have been preserved through an application called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAME\" title=\"\">MAME</a>, and <a href=\"http://blog.sheasilverman.com/raspberry-pi-emulation/\" title=\"\">Silverman's blog</a> outlines how to install MAME on the RPi as well as some more recent games including <em>Cave Story</em> and <em>Quake III</em>.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty 3</strong></p> <h2><strong>9. BABY MONITOR</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711761\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769639619/pi-projects---baby-monito-001.jpg\" alt=\"pi projects - baby monitor\" width=\"150\" height=\"210\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a webcam with microphone, an ethernet cable or Wi-Fi dongle.</p> <p>The keenest parents on the internet are scrambling to <a href=\"http://jeremyblythe.blogspot.it/2012/05/raspberry-pi-webcam.html\" title=\"\">design the first RPi-powered baby monitor</a> with a live audio and video stream so they can check on their offspring from the office. The most enterprising have suggested plugging the RPi into the TV, so if you hear a cry through the speaker, you can simply flip over to the \"baby channel\" rather than go all the way upstairs.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>7</strong></p> <h2><strong>10. HOME-BREWED BEER</strong></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, an Arduino, temperature sensors, a fridge, yeast, hops.</p> <p>Making beer is a delicate process requiring vigilance and tenacity. During fermentation, if your beer slips one degree above or below the correct temperature, the whole batch will be spoiled and it's back to square one. Which is why a Dutchman named Elco Jacobs has designed an intricate program, run off the RPi, to detect the temperature of his nascent brews and automatically correct the temperature of his fridge accordingly. BrewPi is an open-source project so there is a <a href=\"http://brewpi.com/brewpi-released-all-source-code-online-a-wiki-a-forum-a-bug-tracker-lets-go/\" title=\"\">website</a> with in-depth instructions explaining how to adapt the RPi and build the program, which includes a function by which you can track the progress of your beer and even adapt the temperature over the internet. Jacobs himself has already set about creating his first computer-moderated beer, which he plans to name Raspbian Wheaty.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty 7</strong></p> <h2><strong>11. BIRDBOX</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398711762\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351769430303/Pi-projects---a-birdhouse-001.jpg\" alt=\"Pi projects - a birdhouse\" width=\"150\" height=\"156\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Birdhouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a Pi-Face (see glossary), 2 infrared LEDs and two light detectors, a small webcam and a wooden box with a compartment to contain the RPi.</p> <p>The students and staff of the University of Manchester's Computer Science department, the Raspberry Pi's most innovative trailblazers, have designed a DIY nesting box which can photograph birds and amalgamate data relating to their behaviour. They have even written a function which can send you a tweet whenever a bird enters or leaves the box. Their online video shows the finished birdbox and explains how to power the RPi and the Pi-Face as well as providing them with internet access using only one ethernet cable.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>5</strong></p> <h2><strong>12. NEAR-SPACE CRAFT</strong></h2> <p><strong>You will need</strong> an RPi and SD card, a hydrogen balloon, a USB webcam, a GPS, a heatsink, a battery pack, permission from the Civil Aviation Authority.</p> <p>As keen on puns as it is on programming, the RPi community has produced nothing so spectacular as the Pi in the Sky, a huge hydrogen balloon carrying an RPi to an altitude of 40,000 metres \u2013 a full kilometre higher than the top of Felix Baumgartner's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/felix-baumgartner-lands-safely-record\" title=\"\">Red Bull Stratos descent</a>. Thanks to a webcam, it boasts the highest live images \u2013 picked up by receivers run by zealous enthusiasts all over the country \u2013 ever recorded during an unmanned amateur flight. Designed by Dave Akerman and friends, it was launched in Berkshire, and after its balloon burst at the edge of space, the RPi \"safely landed in long grass\" somewhere near Didcot. If the wiring and programming, itemised on <a href=\"http://www.daveakerman.com/?p=592\" title=\"\">Akerman's website</a>, seem too dauntingly complex, the flight should at least illustrate the possibilities available to any RPi fanatics whimsical enough to pursue them.</p> <p><strong>Difficulty</strong> <strong>9 </strong></p> <h2><strong>GLOSSARY</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>Adafruit \"Cobbler\" </strong>A special printed circuit board with a ribbon cable, custom-designed to simplify the Raspberry Pi's otherwise fiddly and confusing hardware pins.</p> <p><strong>Arduino </strong>A microcontroller computer which, combined with the Raspberry Pi, allows you to control a wider range of hardware.</p> <p><strong>Heatsink </strong>A hardware component which helps cool the computer and keep it stable.</p> <p><strong>Linux </strong>A secure open-source operating system which runs on the RPi in a distribution package called Debian. A version of Debian called <a href=\"http://www.raspbian.org/\" title=\"\">Raspbian</a> has already been developed with modifications specific to the RPi.</p> <p><strong>Open-source </strong>Open-source software is software which is distributed with accessible and visible source code so that you can see how it works and even adapt it yourself.</p> <p><strong>Pi-Face:</strong>An interface chip designed by the University of Manchester to improve the RPi's auxiliary capabilities.</p> <p><strong>SD card </strong>The hard-drive of an RPi is provided by an SD card, which must be bought separately.</p> <p><strong>USB hub </strong>A splitter to turn the RPi's single USB port into as many as you need.</p>"
