  "<p>In a week when official statistics showed Britain had ran up a record current account deficit in the spring, the FTSE 100 fell 1.26% on the week, losing 79 points to close on Friday night at 5742.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the \u00a320.8bn deficit \u2013 which includes the UK's trade balance, as well as the shortfall on overseas investments by UK plc \u2013 was the biggest ever for a quarter. And after the market closed, ratings agency Fitch warned Britain had moved a step closer to losing its cherished AAA credit rating.</p> <p>The agency, which already had the UK on \"negative watch\" maintained the AAA rating but warned rising debts and slowing growth jeopardised its status as a safe haven for investors.</p> <p>But on the corporate front the prospect of mergers and acquisitions made a welcome return to the stock market this week. Admittedly, little activity went beyond the talking stage, but investors will take heart at any chance of movement.</p> <p>The news over the past week can be split into two categories \u2013 confirmed talks that may or may not lead to anything substantial, and the most meagre of rumours that are getting punters excited.</p> <p>In the first category is the continuing saga of global commodity trader <strong>Glencore</strong> and mining group <strong>Xstrata</strong>. The miner has until 7am on Monday to decide if it wants to accept an improved $32bn (\u00a319.8bn) offer from Glencore. Early indications suggest that the deadline will be extended again.</p> <p>The other mega-merger between British arms manufacturer <strong>BAE Systems</strong> and Airbus parent <strong>EADS</strong> was the subject of intense political wrangling as both companies attempt to convince German, French, US and British politicians that the deal is in their interests. Again, a deadline extension is the most likely outcome.</p> <p>The makers of Scotland's favourite fizzy drink, Irn-Bru, <strong>AG Barr</strong>, continues its talks with rival <strong>Britvic</strong> for a \u00a31.6bn merger. It has until Tuesday morning to make a decision. Sticking with drinks, the spirits group <strong>Diageo</strong> confirmed it was in discussions with India's <strong>United Spirits</strong>. The deal could see the Guinness maker become one of the biggest drinks operators in India. However, both firms are cautious after a similar takeover attempt failed in 2009.</p> <p>The unsubstantiated rumour also had its place, with supermarket <strong>J Sainsbury plc</strong> said to be in the sights of 26% shareholder and failed bidder the <strong>Qatar Investment Authority</strong> (also Xstrata's second biggest shareholder).</p> <p>Construction supply group <strong>Weir </strong>could attract the attentions of <strong>GE</strong>, following the US group's move to set up a mining subsidiary, while <strong>National Grid</strong> is supposedly being eyed up by Chinese and American predators.</p> <p>Even <strong>Bumi</strong> \u2013 Nat Rothschild's mining baby, which announced an investigation into \"financial irregularities\" on Monday \u2013 could be vulnerable, with a handful of hedge funds said to be looking over the&#xa0;numbers.</p> <p>Finally, Standard Chartered may face a takeover challenge if rumours that Singapore's Temasek sells its 18% stake in the Asia-focused bank.</p> <p>Simon Willis at Daniel Stewart speculated: \"Who are the most likely buyers? A Chinese bank or the sovereign wealth fund; or a middle eastern sovereign wealth fund. We believe the former is the more likely, which may reignite bid speculation, though Standard Chartered clearly has no need to sell out, and certainly not on the cheap.\"</p> <p>The hope must be that all the talk can turn to deals or the City's M&amp;A bankers will be forced to twiddle their thumbs a little longer.</p>",
  "<p>When Queen performed at the closing ceremony of&#xa0;the Olympics \u2013 Freddie Mercury, towering over the crowd in canary-yellow jacket, leading a call-and-response from beyond the grave, Brian May, crowned in his wonky halo of grey curls, squalling his way through the guitar solo from Brighton Rock, and drummer Roger Taylor, with guest Jessie J, thundering into a rendition of We Will Rock You \u2013 they did what they always managed to do so spectacularly live: unite a stadium in belting out an&#xa0;anthem.</p> <p>They \u2013 well May \u2013 also&#xa0;managed to do something new: infuriate a significant percentage of the populace. The trouble was his outfit: a characteristic combination of dark trousers, trainers and long frock coat, except from one sleeve peered the head of a fox; from the other, the black and white snout of a badger.</p> <p>\"He's politicising the Olympics!\" came the cry, from those who made the connection between his attire and his campaign against the government's then imminent approval of <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2012/170912.aspx\" title=\"\">pilot badger culls in Gloucester</a> and Somerset. \"To the farmers struggling against bovine TB and&#xa0;fox predation,\" harrumphed the Countryside Alliance, \"a millionaire rock star using a global sporting celebration to undermine their way of life really stuck in the craw.\" A spokesperson for May said his jacket was in keeping with Danny Boyle's Isles of Wonder theme, including, as it did, a hedgehog, a buzzard, two herons and an adder, \"most of which are protected or in decline\" \u2013 which was plausible, up to a point.</p> <p>For it is true that May is on a mission. \"All the available scientific evidence points to the fact that the cull probably will not work,\" he says now, sitting in a hotel bar in Kensington. \"It will not save a single cow. It might do, but it's a huge unknown \u2013 a huge extrapolation, and extrapolation of scientific evidence is a very dangerous game.\" His voice is soft, languid in the way of someone accustomed to being listened to. \"If you talk to any expert on cows and bovine TB in Britain, bar a couple who work for Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs], you will get the same answer, including from Lord Krebs.\" Krebs led the only major scientific trial of culling, a \u00a350m study known as the randomised badger culling or Krebs trial, which culled 11,000 badgers over five years and found that if certain conditions were met, culling could reduce disease incidence by an average of just 16% over nine years. \"Krebs said culling is a crazy idea, we shouldn't be doing it, we should be vaccinating,\" adds May. \"So I'm not a lone voice. I'm not a&#xa0;renegade hippy.\"</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">a petition he has launched with Team Badger</a>, a coalition of various animal rights groups, had more than 134,000 signatures, well in excess of the 100,000 required to get a debate considered in parliament. (The coalition includes May's own anti-animal cruelty organisation, established when he realised, in 2010, that David Cameron would try to repeal the anti-hunting act. It is called, with the unapologetic sentimentality that imbues the songs he wrote for Queen, Save Me, and marked the end of his life-long support for the Tory party.)</p> <p>May is working on the campaign around the clock, talking to scientists, emailing activists, doing interviews, updating his website. \"It's threatening my life, it's utterly consuming my life. It makes it difficult to continue a proper family life, it makes it difficult to continue music, to continue astronomy, to continue my stereoscopic adventures.\" May is, famously, unusual in the rock firmament in that he possesses a PhD in&#xa0;astronomy, and has written books about it (the most recent, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781847326195\" title=\"\">The Cosmic Tourist</a>, written with Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott, will be published next month) and another obsession, stereoscopy. \"So I suppose I&#xa0;solve the problem by not sleeping very much.\" He says his friends, largely, support his campaign, but that his wife, Anita Dobson \u2013 though helping with the petition, \"has at times made me question whether I should be spending this much time on it\".</p> <p>As we talk, his eye is suddenly caught by a scene behind us, and his voice hardens. \"Sorry, excuse me, are you having trouble, Anne?\" Anne is Anne Brummer, of Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue Centre in Surrey, who has rescued thousands of animals over the past 25 years and has released many of them on to his land. A waiter has been trying to explain to Anne that the bar is not yet open. \"Who says? Can we talk to your manager please?\" The gentle tone is suddenly gone; in its place is the full force of rock star high-handedness.</p> <p>He turns back to me. \"Sorry, I hate people who say things can't be done.\" His tone is avuncular again, expansive. \"It must be in my upbringing.\" In what way? \"Well, my parents thought we were middle class\" \u2013 his father, who when May was a teenager helped him build the guitar he still uses out of motorbike valve springs, a mahogany fireplace, a bike saddle, and mother-of-pearl buttons from his mother's button box, was an electronics draughtsman in the civil service \u2013 \"but we were very poor. They had a pride in doing things well. Life is too short for people who don't want to do their job well.\"</p> <p>Speaking of jobs, it's understandable, isn't it, if farmers feel that it is all very well for someone in a comfortable position \u2026 \"I'm not in a comfortable position,\" interjects May. \"This is killing me!\" I look for a trace of irony, but it doesn't appear to be there. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rock stars shouldn't have anything to say about farming. Well, sorry, it's time to wake up. Farming, like every other industry, including mine, has to be open to change or it dies. \u2026 [And] if the price of my glass of milk on the table, or my cheese is the death of possibly hundreds of thousands of badgers, I don't want it. I like me milk, I&#xa0;like me cheese, but the day the first shot is fired by the government against the badgers, I will never drink another drop of milk unless I know it's come from a humane farm.\"</p> <p>But that, as even some anti-cull activists admit, is just punishing farmers further. \"No, it's not. It's giving people the right to choose who to support.\"</p> <p>What is it about him and animals, exactly? Where does this passion come from? \"It's a childhood thing, but it's been reinforced by the life I've led. I'm an astronomer.\" Even when he was touring the world with Queen, May kept up with the academic journals. He has an asteroid named after him, has spent months chasing eclipses from Mexico to Outer Mongolia, and periodically appears on the Sky at Night with his friend Patrick Moore. \"For a thousand years the Ptolemaic system was believed all round the world. The system says that the Earth is at the centre of the universe. It turns out not to be true. But this idea that we are the centre of creation lingers on \u2013 where is the justification to say we are the central piece of evolution? There is nothing to tell us that whatsoever. So why would we use that to justify our exceedingly bad behaviour?\"</p> <p>In fact, he said, a couple of years ago, that he would rather be remembered for his animal rights work than for music or astronomy. Really? \"Yep. I won't be remembered in 1,000 years anyway, but I would like to leave this planet knowing that I did what I could to make it a better place, a more decent place, a more compassionate place.\"</p> <p>Having said which, he doesn't seem to find this campaigning lark that fulfilling. \"People say: 'Are&#xa0;you enjoying it?' No. I love my music, I love my art. And I'm quite good at it.\" Rolling Stone last year ranked him as 26th of the 100 best guitarists of all time. \"So really I should be making music \u2013 I <em>have</em> to have time \u2013 because if I lose music from my life, I lose my self.\"</p> <p>He is about to embark on a short tour with Kelly Ellis, accompanying her on&#xa0;acoustic guitar and performing by candlelight. \"It's almost like a reaction to the music that made Queen famous, though if you look at it some of it's very simple. We Will Rock You is very simple. Millionaire Waltz is highly complex.\"</p> <p>It is perhaps instructive \u2013 or maybe not \u2013 that May wrote We Will Rock You, while Freddie Mercury wrote The Millionaire Waltz: for all his obvious intelligence, there is something of the emotional bludgeon about May and his&#xa0;lyrics: they are obviously wildly effective \u2013 in 2006, Queen's Greatest Hits became the best-selling album ever \u2013 but relatively uncomplicated (unlike his guitar solos): We Will Rock You. The Show Must Go On. I Want It All.</p> <p>Musically, he and Mercury dovetailed brilliantly, but did he ever feel overshadowed and resentful of his flamboyantly gifted frontman? \"No, we actually pushed him forward. It was me who designed that first cover and put him on [it]. That was my vision of what Queen's image would be. Because Freddie was born to it. Though he was very democratic. People often said, in interviews, 'This is your band' \u2013 and he'd say, 'Don't be stupid, darling.'\" May's voice alters subtly, suddenly there's another person in the room. \"This is a&#xa0;<em>band</em>.\"</p> <p>What was it like, performing with Mercury again, albeit in the form of a&#xa0;hologram? \"It was nice. I mean, Freddie's with us the whole time, really. Freddie's spirit is very strong and we spent so much of our lives together, I&#xa0;can't imagine a day where I wouldn't refer to him in some way. I'm very comfortable with that now. I wasn't in the beginning.\" In fact, he was so grief-stricken by the loss of his friend and colleague, which came at about the same time as the breakup of his first marriage and the death of his father, that he slipped into a severe depression. \"It was quite a long grieving process, but I'm comfortable with it now. He lived life to the full, he created magnificently, from his soul. He was fearless.\"</p> <p>During another period of depression, a suicidal episode, May went to a clinic in Arizona. \"They said, 'What is your religion, what is your spirituality?' I said: 'I'm not sure.' And they said: 'Well, we need your spirituality to be a centre for your recovery. And I kind of floundered around for a while and in the end it was looking at the stars that gave that feeling back to me.</p> <p>\"There's a great thing called The Serenity Prayer,\" he says. \"It's taught in all kinds of clinics \u2013 it starts off with the word God, but you can say Higher Power \u2013 'God, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.'\"</p> <p>He delivers the homily as if it is not cross-stitched and stuck up on wall after wall throughout the world. \"To me that's incredibly empowering and very often if I get to a sort of trough, that's what I look at. It focuses you on the things which you can change.\" And he stands up to his full 6ft 2in, plus a good five inches or so of hair, and wanders off to be photographed. From the lapel of his frock coat, a badger winks.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012.

  "<p>Standing at the 1st tee of the Ryder Cup, the chanting had already begun. \"USA! USA!\" went first, quickly drowned out by Europe supporters in the galleries with a riposte of \"Oool\u00e9, ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, ol\u00e9, oool\u00e9.\"</p> <p>On a chilly Illinois morning, with warming coffee the drink of choice, the chants soon died down. The beer and the boisterousness would have to wait until later. Nonetheless, the home crowd's mood on the first hole of the tournament was also dampened by the waywardness of the USA driving.</p> <p>Not that Europe located the fairway much better but when Jim Furyk, Jason Dufner and Tiger Woods all fluffed their drives \u2013 from the mundanely bunkered to the ridiculously wild \u2013 the crowd were given little to get excited about.</p> <p>Given the fervour with which Woods in his pomp was once greeted by American crowds, the support was relatively muted on the opening morning. As, for that matter, was the play of the former world No1.</p> <p>The gathering clouds, the cool air and Europe's progress on the scoreboard did nothing to get the 40,000 crowd going. The big cheers (for USA successes) around the course were sporadic at best and replaced by ironic applause when an American pairing managed to level up their ties.</p> <p>Early in the morning, early in the tournament, the fans were all politeness and respect. The pre-tournament rhetoric had all been about dialling down the aggro and ramping up the respect. Well, mostly.</p> <p>The USA captain, Davis Love, had stressed at the opening ceremony that: \"We should remember that these matches are not life and death. Golf should be played in a spirit of graciousness, or it is not golf at all. Nobody should confuse these matches with any sort of battle except an athletic one.\" Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, his Europe counterpart, echoed the sentiment.</p> <p>\"It's all very mellow and polite this morning,\" said Brian from New York. \"Give it time \u2013 and six beers at lunchtime \u2013 and then we'll see.\"</p> <p>As the sun poked its head out and the early morning chill disappeared, the first beers started appearing around the course. More importantly, perhaps, the Americans got back into the game and the noise levels went up.</p> <p>From down in all four matches to all-square, a cry from the crowd came: \"Oh yeah, the tide is turning, baby!\"</p> <p>The men on the manually operated scoreboards dotted around the course encouraged the cheering and chanting as they revealed improving American scores.</p> <p>As the end of the opening foursomes approached, Andy from Seattle had a theory: \"It's getting to lunchtime, that's 6pm in the UK. Your boys are getting tired.\"</p> <p>As the afternoon heat combined with the Bud Lights any anticipated surge in US boisterousness and triumphalism was tempered by the domination of the American players. There were so few cheers from the Europeans that the American supporters could just relax and enjoy a dominant position.</p> <p>With the wind gone, the sun beating down and the beer having a calming rather than rousing effect the home crowd had plenty to applaud and little to be anxious about. The biggest question was whether to head towards the closing holes to bag a spot \u2013 given that several of the matches might not reach that far. The large quantity of beer consumed also meant that the toilet queues were huge \u2013 and the biggest deterrent to drinking more beer.</p> <p>Another calming factor was the quietness of the European contingent. With little to shout about, the European supporters quietly drank the afternoon away, the only thing declaring their presence being the occasional loud outfit.</p>",
  "<p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas may be gradually stepping up the pace of change at Tottenham Hotspur but he is quick to emphasise the importance of one particular face from the past.</p> <p>Before the manager's summer arrival at White Hart Lane, Jermain Defoe had become increasingly accustomed to warming the substitutes' bench but Villas-Boas appears to have breathed so much new life into the England striker's career that he seems a player transformed.</p> <p>\"Jermain is looking extremely happy,\" said Villas-Boas, whose side travel to Manchester United on Saturday. \"For a striker, goals are absolutely decisive and Jermain has four in the Premier League so he is not far off being the league's top scorer. But he has been creating so much [as well] that I think he has been immense for the team.\"</p> <p>Villas-Boas's decision to offer the 29-year-old a new three-year contract rather than, as had been expected, sell him at the first opportunity, is paying dividends. \"He is getting continuous opportunities that maybe he didn't have in the past,\" said Harry Redknapp's successor.</p> <p>\"We have to be very grateful for what he has been doing for the team. We have to respect the fact hat he keeps motivating himself for this club. Now he is gaining confidence from playing from the start. He is performing well. His movement and his motivation are fantastic.</p> <p>\"In the summer we really wanted to keep him here and that is why we spoke to his agent and to the chairman [Daniel Levy] regarding his contract renewal. At the moment we are extremely happy with what he is doing. I am sure there is an impact on how he feels about himself.\"</p>",
  "<p>If you are fed-up with living in a cold house or paying huge heating bills, and can't afford expensive home improvements, could the government's long-awaited green deal help? Unveiled in 2010, and promoted with the promise that \"every British home will be able to install energy-saving technologies such as insulation at no upfront cost\", this much talked-about scheme finally kicks off on Monday.</p> <p>Big and small firms will be able to borrow from a central fund and use the money to install energy efficiency measures in homes. The householder gradually pays for the work done via the savings they will see in lower gas and electricity bills. Inevitably, it is more complicated than that \u2013 much more \u2013 but if you are keen to make your home more energy efficient and don't have the money available upfront, you will want to take a look at this scheme.</p> <p>Consumers will be able to arrange for a green deal assessor to visit their home to calculate how best the property can be improved. Wall insulation or a new boiler are likely to be the most recommended work, but a host of other measures are also possible under the scheme's terms.</p> <p>Once you have a home improvement plan in place, you will have to wait until January before you can sign up for work to start. The scheme will particularly appeal to those living in rural areas off the gas grid who currently heat their home using oil or LPG. When combined with the government's Renewable Heat Incentive, due next year, householders will be able to replace their heating with a renewable system and spread payments over many years.</p> <p>Energy-efficiency firms across the UK (though not in Northern Ireland) have been gearing up for the green deal, which they hope will rejuvenate the sector and help bring Britain's traditionally poor housing stock into the 21st century. And with ministers keen to get the scheme up and running with a good take-up, and backing it with \u00a3200m, it looks as though those signing up at the start will see some financial benefits for being an early adopter.</p> <p>So how does it work in detail? At the heart of the green deal legislation is the \"golden rule,\" which states that estimated savings on bills must always equal or exceed the cost of the work.</p> <p>If you agree to have work done, the firm that installs the measures informs your electricity supplier about your green deal \"plan\" so that your payments for the work can start to be collected through your electricity bills. Your energy supplier then writes to you confirming the details.</p> <p>The Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) says it particularly wants to encourage the take-up of solid wall insulation and \"hard-to-treat\" cavity wall insulation, which is often expensive \u2013 typically \u00a35,000-\u00a310,000 per home for solid wall insulation. It can take many years to recoup the cost in lower energy bills, but once this type of insulation is installed, it can transform a home's energy efficiency, delivering benefits for decades.</p> <p>How much you can \"borrow\" will depend on the identified savings based on the size of your home, the number of occupants and the current size of your bills. Some work, such as double glazing, may require an upfront part-payment. The same may apply to those looking to install an A-rated gas boiler, typically costing \u00a32,500. Householders will be able to use the scheme to pay to install electricity generating solar panels, but won't be able to include the feed-in-tariff payments when calculating the savings, meaning some upfront payments will again be required.</p> <p>Consumers will initially have an Energy Performance Certificate survey carried out which will be used to create your green deal plan. Some companies will charge householders for the survey and plan, while other firms are expected to offer them free as long as you take their package of measures.</p> <p>Decc says it has put in place a scheme that will let \"the market\" decide how the deal is offered to consumers. It expects some firms to be able to offer deals on an interest-free basis, while others will charge interest. Currently, it looks as though 7.5% will be a typical rate, but this could change.</p> <p>Decc says it has set up the scheme in a way that householders will be able to use their local plumber, provided they have been through the accreditation process. It adds that consumers signing up should see a seamless process.</p> <p>What looks certain is that those signing up will have to do a lot of shopping around. Different companies will offer different terms, and it will be a case of working out which is best. Those \"borrowing\" more than \u00a310,000 will be required to get several quotes. Buyers will also want to compare what they are told with the cost of borrowing on the high street. Expect a rash of websites comparing the cost of these offerings.</p> <p>Green deal borrowers will be able to pay off their \"loans\" early, but there might be redemption fees, which could be significant if the loan was taken over more than 15 years. Tenants will be able to sign up to the deal, and social housing providers are expected to be big users.</p> <p>Although much of this area looks set to be dominated by the \"big six\" energy firms, the government wants the scheme to be available through small plumbing and other energy firms as well. Meanwhile, Ecology building society and the Energy Saving Co-operative have launched what they describe as a \"co-operative, community-based alternative\" to the green deal that will be available initially in Oxfordshire and the Midlands. They say it is about putting power in the hands of homeowners and small businesses to help them capture the benefits \"rather than handing these over to the financial markets and the 'big six'\".</p> <p>Decc says anyone selling green deal products will have to be accredited, and needs to have been through the training process. It hopes this will cut out much of the mis-selling that has blighted the energy and solar markets in particular. Strict standards will be put in place to prevent consumers being ripped off by cowboys, it says. Customers in dispute with providers will have access to an ombudsman service.</p> <p>Some people will wonder what happens if they move house after signing up. One of the clever bits of the green deal is that the debt remains on the home's electricity account until it is paid off. If you move house, the next owner is expected to take on the repayments, which is fair given that they will be enjoying the benefits. Equally, renters moving into a property will have to pay for any measurers carried out by previous tenant/landlord.</p> <p>The government says anyone who has had work done will still be able to switch gas and electricity supplier \u2013 although very small/new suppliers may not accept green deal debts.</p> <p><em>For more information call the </em><a href=\"http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Organisations/Government/Energy-Saving-Advice-Service\" title=\"Energy Saving Advice Service\"><em>Energy Saving Advice Service</em></a><em>: 0300 123 1234 (for Scotland call 0800 512 012).</em></p>",
  "<p>While we clearly all have a responsibility to control our energy usage, there are a number of potential problems with the government's green deal.</p> <p>The initiative is designed to help businesses and encourage homeowners to employ more green technologies in their homes. The idea is simple; install them into your property with no upfront outlay. You pay back the costs through your energy bill over a period.</p> <p>This is unlike a conventional loan, because if you move the bill stays with the property where the savings are occurring, not with the bill payer.</p> <p>The main \"hook\" that will be used by sales reps to get consumers interested is the fact that it won't cost them anything extra \u2013 the monthly repayments will be covered by the savings made on your energy bill after the relevant measures have been installed.</p> <p>This sounds great. But no two households are the same, and no two households have the same pattern of consumption. There are complicated formulas to predict what savings can be made, but there are so many variables \u2013 plus continual energy price changes \u2013 that it's almost impossible to work out.</p> <p>Bear in mind that doorstep selling, where sales reps are paid a commission for signing up consumers, will be one of the main routes to market for green deal providers. This method only operates in the economic interests of businesses, not consumers, and sales reps on commission are often economical with the truth and don't provide best value for money. Just look at the evidence from the debacle of doorstep energy sales by the \"big six\".</p> <p>Trading standards officers advise consumers to <em>never</em> buy under pressure on the doorstep, and recommend taking time to shop around.</p> <p>After much lobbying by the <a href=\"http://www.tradingstandards.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Trading Standards Institute</a>, the green deal code of practice contains a requirement for all providers to respect \"No cold callers\" stickers displayed in homes. If you haven't got a sticker yet, get one.</p> <p>In some cases there will also be other work that needs to be done in conjunction with green deal measures, such as repointing of chimney stacks, repairs to the damp-proof course or some electrical rewiring.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department of Energy and Climate Change</a> is wasting the golden opportunity it has to signpost consumers to approved trader schemes such as the local authority-run \"<a href=\"http://www.buywithconfidence.gov.uk/sitepages/bwchome.aspx\" title=\"\">Buy With Confidence</a>\" , which mainly operates in southern England, or the government-endorsed <a href=\"http://www.trustmark.org.uk/\" title=\"\">TrustMark</a> scheme. If ancillary work is carried out by the cowboys, the green deal will be irrevocably tarnished.</p> <p>There is a great reliance on self-regulation within the new regime. However, I want to see some independent inspection of work that has been carried out to ensure it has been done properly and that the expected energy savings have a greater chance of being realised; rogue operators need to be pinpointed and eliminated very quickly.</p> <p>Meanwhile, great care is needed to avoid turning homes into hermetically-sealed greenhouses, which might lead to condensation problems and thereby contribute to health issues for householders.</p> <p>Finally, the notion that green deal plans will be passed on to future buyers of your home is flawed.</p> <p>The reality is that when you sell your home, a prospective purchaser will probably ask you to pay off the plan in full before they buy from you. I would.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Steve Playle is investigations and enforcement manager at Surrey Trading Standards</em></p>",
  "<p>Poor old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/rupert-everett\" title=\"\">Rupert Everett</a> thought he'd taken every care to say nothing in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/oct/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">his first memoir</a> that could upset his friend Madonna. Then the book came out, she threw a strop and stopped talking to him.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/20/vanished-years-rupert-everett-review?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">His new memoir</a> is less scandalously gossipy,&nbsp;so further fallings-out had looked unlikely \u2013 but before its release this week, he was already in hot water again. Everett can't understand it. \"What's happened to humour? We're becoming American. Everyone gets so angry over everything.\"</p> <p>But I'm not sure how much he really cares, and to my mind you'd have to be even more humourless than Madonna to hold anything against him. After reading Vanished Years, I didn't just want to buy the book but kidnap its author and gallivant about town with him for ever.</p> <p>Not so much a kiss-and-tell as a love letter from Everett to a lost past, the book is nostalgic for a&nbsp;world in which big stars were big characters. He's a dreadful snob, really, but of the most adventurous kind, drawn to life's underbelly and in thrall to extremes, but bored to death by mediocrity. Now 53, still handsome but no longer the shocking beauty of his youth, Everett writes with a rare blend of wistful lament, comic observation and opinionated mischief \u2013 and in person turns out to be exactly the same.</p> <p>Vanished Years opens with Everett's account of&nbsp;his ill-fated appearance on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9JOIR24ssg\" title=\"\">Comic Relief Does The Apprentice</a>, to which he'd agreed having never actually seen the show. Appalled to find himself on a testosterone-crazed team led by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/piersmorgan\" title=\"\">Piers Morgan</a>, and overseen by a man he mistakes&nbsp;for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_James\" title=\"\">Sid James</a> but who turns out to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/alan-sugar\" title=\"\">Sir&nbsp;Alan Sugar</a>, Everett has a panic attack, bolts out of an emergency exit and legs it to the Ritz. Pursued by&nbsp;the production crew, he ends up cycling to King's Cross and escaping on a train to Norfolk. I'm not sure he's fully recovered yet.</p> <p>\"Seeing Morgan and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/alastaircampbell\" title=\"\">Alastair [Campbell]</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Kemp\" title=\"\">Ross Kemp</a> was like a flashback to me of exactly why I peeled off from the mainstream in life so very early. Just feeling outside from groups of rugger-buggers at school; they just set off a kind of alarm bell in me. To me, Piers Morgan was a person who just reminded me, exactly, of all the people I was terrified of at school. I don't like how he is; I've seen him on a few other Apprentice-like things and he takes it too seriously. He's a killer. He's pathological.</p> <p>\"But, at the same time,\" Everett reflects, suddenly looking quite impressed, \"I think how he's moulded himself into a new career \u2013 well, I&nbsp;love people managing to achieve things. I&nbsp;think it's quite clever. Also, he reminds me of Oscar Wilde, in a way. He could play Oscar Wilde if you&nbsp;put him in a long wig \u2013 he's so kind of slobby and elephantine. But I can't imagine him with poor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celia_Walden\" title=\"\">Celia Walden</a> [Morgan's wife]. She's gorgeous and very funny. I mean, she deserves to be fucked by a god.\"</p> <p>Maybe she feels that's what she's getting? Everett considers this possibility doubtfully. \"Maybe he is. I've always imagined him to be hung like a budgie underneath it all.\" He ponders the matter further. \"Or maybe the penetrative act is not what turns her on. Anyway,\" he brightens, \"it only makes it more <em>riveting</em> to me. I mean, the Celia factor does make it fascinating. I love his wife. So now that I love his wife, I'm rather confused about him. Because <a href=\"http://www.exposay.com/celebrity-photos/piers-morgan-and-celia-walden-london-fashion-1cBnaD.jpg\" title=\"\">she's so chic-looking</a> and he dresses like a school slob.\"</p> <p>I tell him Morgan now has a personal trainer on&nbsp;each coast of the US, and that last time we met&nbsp;he made me touch his tricep so I could feel the results. Everett's face lights up and he leans in, enthralled. \"<em>Ree-aa-lly?</em>\"</p> <p>It's this ambivalence about whether he's one of them or one of us that makes Everett such a&nbsp;divine chronicler of celebrity. \"It's good to write things down, because I think everyone kind of colludes in misrepresenting show business quite often \u2013 from your side and our side. We both ask each other and answer each other the wrong questions, always. And the bullshit gets wiped back and forth. It's so boring. So we all collude in misrepresenting the nuts and bolts of a rather interesting world.\"</p> <p>Or at least, a world that used to be rather interesting. \"I'm very romantic about the past, really. So I think it's also a middle-aged book. I&nbsp;guess middle age is, well, probably every generation feels the world is ending, slightly, at that age \u2013 and it is. I guess every generation is kind of ending. But New York has really changed. I mean it really has changed, so it isn't just a&nbsp;middle-age whine \u2013 the old New York of the 70s really doesn't exist. Everywhere is the same place now; everything's been made into a&nbsp;Disney Street. If you look at books of Hollywood homes in the 70s, it's just amazing how humble they are; they're like little beach shanty houses with bric-a-brac furniture. Now, the smallest fucking brainless Hollywood producer lives in an <a href=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090820042724/lyricwiki/images/d/d4/Earth,_Wind_%26_Fire_-_All_'N_All.jpg\" title=\"\">Earth Wind &amp; Fire Egyptian palace</a>. It's just\u2026 It's&nbsp;become so tasteless, I suppose.\"</p> <p>Everett is comically glum about the sanitisation of show business \u2013 the military schedules of early nights and abstinence enforced by po-faced publicists, and all the \"hollow, vulnerable\" parties that make him long for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_54\" title=\"\">Studio 54</a>'s carnival of freaks. But then again, he's become uncharacteristically abstinent himself; a few years ago he noticed his libido had vanished, and&nbsp;he stopped taking drugs once the thought had occurred, \"Oh God, I'd hate to have a stroke doing a line of coke.\" So it's not always clear if he's mourning a world that has passed, or the passing of his own gilded youth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396778314\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348743390500/Rupert-Everett-and-Sabrin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Everett and Sabrina Guiness, 1982\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Everett and heiress Sabrina Guinness in 1982.

He'd more or less run away from his Catholic boarding school in his teens, to train at drama school in London, making ends meet by working on the side as a&nbsp;rent boy until general insubordination got him kicked out. Another Country propelled him to Hollywood, and the auspices of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/orsonwelles\" title=\"\">Orson Welles</a>, but after success with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088987/\" title=\"\">Dance With A Stranger</a>, his early promise began to unravel. Following some forgettable films and a bizarre stab at pop stardom, Everett ended up making TV in Russia, lolled around Europe, wrote a couple of novels, did some modelling and gradually inched his way back into Hollywood's gaze with comic turns in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/55729/madness-of-king-george\" title=\"\">The Madness Of King George</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110907/\" title=\"\">Pret-A-Porter</a>. In&nbsp;1997, he starred alongside Julia Roberts in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119738/\" title=\"\">My&nbsp;Best Friend's Wedding</a> and was suddenly red hot again, charming everyone with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138097/\" title=\"\">Shakespeare In Love</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0122541/\" title=\"\">An Ideal Husband</a> \u2013 until an over-hyped 1999 comedy co-starring Madonna, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2000/jun/23/madonna\" title=\"\">The Next Best Thing, bombed so badly</a> that both their&nbsp;Hollywood careers were over for good.</p> <p>Since then, Everett has rebuilt a reputation as&nbsp;an unpredictable but inspired elder statesman of&nbsp;the theatre, and in 2006 surprised everyone again with his recklessly indiscreet memoir, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/oct/07/featuresreviews.guardianreview7\" title=\"\">Red&nbsp;Carpets And Other Banana Skins</a>. No one writes about failure more delightfully than Everett. The only downside to it all has been having to experience it.</p> <p>\"Oh, it's horrible,\" he says. \"You've been lulled into being somebody very important in a business \u2013 and our business is all about status \u2013 so every idea you have when it's going well, everyone says, 'That is a great idea, Rupert, we've got to go and have a meeting about that.' You think it's because it's the most fantastic idea, but you have the same idea the next year and no one listens. So it's a character destruction. You have to die \u2013 it's dying. The disaster is holding on. You keep acting in the way that you were to those people to whom you are no longer who you were, and they go, \"You're not that person any more.' And&nbsp;that's when you become really vile. That's what normally happens.\"</p> <p>Everett has always blamed all his false starts and failures on Hollywood's prejudice against an openly gay leading man. Any suggestion that self-sabotage might have played a part, too, has made him terribly indignant in the past, but today, when I observe that at the very height of his My Best Friend's Wedding renaissance, he scandalised America by telling a tabloid about his days as a rent boy, he just lets out a guilty little laugh. \"Did I? Oh.\"</p> <p>By his own admission, he behaved appallingly towards the director of Dance With A Stranger when he was still far too young to have seriously expected to get away with it. And how could he have thought Madonna wouldn't mind being called a \"whiny old barmaid\" who played with her boyfriend's penis in public? For all the white heat of Everett's ambition, I'm not convinced he ever truly wanted the success he thought he craved.</p> <p>\"That's weird, because I'm playing Oscar Wilde at the moment [in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/sep/12/the-judas-kiss-review\" title=\"\">The Judas Kiss</a>], and people say about him that he sabotaged himself. And I&nbsp;don't know that you realise, yourself. I mean, obviously it's true, but whether it's just from being a silly fairy or from really, inside, wanting to sabotage things, I don't know.\" Which does he think it is in his case? \"Both, probably.\"</p> <p>He thinks Aids had a lot to do with some of his early diva-ish misbehaviour. \"Having been such a&nbsp;slag and a slut in the 1970s, then Aids came along and I spent six years in sheer terror.\" A mosquito bite on set one day was enough to plunge him into meltdown, when he mistook the red mark for a lesion. \"That was part of my landscape then, this terror that was always there. Nearly everyone I slept with was dying, you couldn't test until about 1986, and that was really the big period of my life. That's what all queens went through who'd been in those days beforehand, when everyone fucked everyone just as a matter of course, so I think that's what started everything off for me in a kind of weird, skewed way. Because terror makes you behave very strangely. People have forgotten about that. It was absolute terror. So living like that, if something niggled you, you&nbsp;could explode and be really difficult.\"</p> <p>I ask if he's ever had therapy and he looks appalled. \"No!\" He has been to a hypnotherapist, though \u2013 \"To get me to go to work with a more cheerful attitude\" \u2013 and to his amazement it worked. He thinks he'll probably need to see her again, though. \"Mmm. Old habits die hard.\"</p> <p>These days, he's a brilliantly funny observer of celebrity tantrums \u2013 \"screaming and throwing things and torturing assistants and complaining about the schedule of their next movie to various vassals in offices still open on the coast\" \u2013 so I&nbsp;tell him I can't understand how he can write like that and still be capable of behaving like that. \"Oh, because you behave like a diva when you get tired. For example, last week I was really nasty to the lady in the wardrobe of my new play about putting on my new wig \u2013 I was horrible to her. Well, I just was horrible, because I was incredibly nervous and this lovely lady who doesn't normally put on wigs was very nervous, and I&nbsp;was unsure. I loathed the wig, and result: sheer&nbsp;tsunami of divadom.\"</p> <p>And in that moment it feels entirely justified? \"Oh, absolutely, yeah. Female circumcision was about to happen.\" And afterwards, how does he feel? \"Awful. Terrible.\" Yet never so bad that it won't happen again? He offers a carelessly elegant little mea culpa shrug. \"But things happen, don't they?\" He chuckles, then sighs. \"Things happen.\"</p> <p>His problem, he thinks, might be that he grew up in the 1970s with a misleading impression of&nbsp;what stardom would entail and demand. \"That&nbsp;was when stars like Elizabeth Taylor said exactly what they thought, and my notion of being a star was that there&nbsp;was only one way it was valuable, and that's if you are yourself. Not these mirages \u2013 these ghost figures, untouchable, who don't allow themselves to be anything.\" I wonder if he thinks he might also have been just a bit too clever. \"For acting? Oh, yeah. I'm much too intelligent. The best thing to be is bovine in acting \u2013 it looks best on screen. Yes, I think being bovine is definitely a&nbsp;plus. Because then, if you just go, 'Moo', everyone goes, 'Oh my God, that guy has got so much hidden depth' because they&nbsp;can put anything they want into the moo.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396778315\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348744018892/Rupert-Everett-and-Freddi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Everett and Freddie Fox in The Judas Kiss\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Everett as Oscar Wilde and Freddie Fox as Bosie in The Judas Kiss, London, 2012. Photograph: Rex</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In many ways Everett must be the&nbsp;closest approximation we're ever likely to see of a&nbsp;21st-century Oscar Wilde. He is capable of sincere appreciation of almost any activity, if skilfully executed; tabloid trickery is \"genius\", advertising is \"genius\", and when I point out that the Third Reich could also be described as genius, he looks pleasantly surprised. \"That's the kind of thing I&nbsp;would say.\" But he's equally sincere about the charitable causes he's supported and gets worked up about everything from global poverty to the law that requires Jamaicans to get visas before they can visit Britain. \"Just because, what, maybe some dealers are going to come over? We need dealers, to be quite honest. It's the English who&nbsp;want the drugs. It's so unfair.\" He adores the traditional high Tory old-fashioned values of stoicism and honour, while extolling a languid sort of affectless libertarianism \u2013 \"People can do whatever they like, as far as I'm concerned\" \u2013 and finds everything either wildly funny or deeply serious, sometimes simultaneously. Around his neck hangs a gigantic, diamond-encrusted crucifix, but his last words before we part are a&nbsp;baroque rant against churches.</p> <p>\"Why do queens want to go and get married in churches? Obviously this crusty old pathetic, Anglican church \u2013 the most joke-ish church of&nbsp;all jokey churches \u2013 of course they don't want to have queens getting married. It's kind of understandable that they don't; they're crusty old calcified freaks. But why do we want to get married in churches? I don't understand that, myself, personally. I <em>loathe</em> heterosexual weddings; I&nbsp;would never go to a wedding in my life. I loathe the flowers, I loathe the fucking wedding dress, the little bridal tiara. It's grotesque. It's just hideous. The wedding cake, the party, the champagne, the inevitable divorce two years later. It's just a waste of time in the heterosexual world, and in the homosexual world I find it personally beyond tragic that we want to ape this institution that is so clearly a disaster.\"</p> <p>So I wasn't entirely surprised when, just a few days later, he landed himself in trouble. It was a&nbsp;throwaway remark to a Sunday supplement \u2013 \"I&nbsp;can't think of anything worse than being brought up by two gay dads\" \u2013 and within hours the world's media was buzzing with letters from&nbsp;angry gay dads calling Everett a dinosaur. Like every other ding-dong to have ever come his way, it seems to have taken him by surprise, because he calls and invites me to lunch to explain what he meant.</p> <p>\"For me, being gay was about wanting to do the&nbsp;opposite of the straight world, so I think that's&nbsp;where my problems in this particular area come from. For me, personally, the last thing I would like in the entire world would be to go through cocktailing my sperm with my boyfriend and finding some grim couple in Ohio who are gluten-free and who you pay $75,000 to have your baby. To me it feels absolutely hideous. But that's me, just me. I'm not having a go at gay couples who do. I think if Elton and David want to&nbsp;have babies, that's wonderful. I think we should all do what we want.</p> <p>\"Isn't there a middle way, where you can just say, 'Not for me, but it doesn't matter'? But no, everything's sort of turned into al-Qaida. I'm sure I'm going to be nail-bombed. David Furnish is probably going to send Patrick Cox with a bomb and blow up the theatre.\" Beneath the expression of&nbsp;pained innocence, he looks rather&nbsp;thrilled.</p> <p>\u2022 Vanished Years, by Rupert Everett, is published by Little, Brown at \u00a320.

  "<p>As I walk up a street of grand wedding-cake villas not far from Primrose Hill in north London, it is not hard to spot where Matthew Williamson lives. Aside from a few houses painted in peeling pastels that are a throwback to the area's more bohemian past, the style is uniformly bankers-who-brunch. Lots of immaculate black ironwork and bay trees standing in sentry pairs. It is late morning, a precious day of September sunshine, but all is glossy and frozen, as if liberally sprayed with Elnett. And then I hear music drifting from one of the huge open bay windows. A string of Indian silk&#xa0;stuffed birds, trinket of a million 1990s gap years, spins gently in the breeze, and beyond I can see a white marble <a href=\"http://www.dwr.com/category/designers/r-t/eero-saarinen.do\" title=\"\">Eero Saarinen</a> table crammed with peace lilies and an enormous <a href=\"http://www.muranonet.com/\" title=\"\">Murano</a> glass ashtray. On the white walls are a&#xa0;Cameroonian juju headdress in Tango orange and a Jimi Hendrix poster in vintage psychedelic font. The mantelpiece is crammed with bell jars, Mexican votive candles and vintage frames of pinned butterflies.</p> <p>The man who invented boho-glamour, who convinced perfectly sane British women to spend their salaries on dressing like Sienna Miller on her way to a post-yoga beach party, lives in an apartment that is, satisfyingly, exactly&#xa0;how I'd&#xa0;imagined it. This is the Matthew&#xa0;Williamson aesthetic come to life: bright colours, dressed-up, an unjaded appreciation of pretty stuff and a hazy, cheerfully glamorised version of laid-back hippy chic. I&#xa0;buzz, and the door opens. \"Hiya,\" Williamson says, his accent and choice of greeting still unmistakably Mancunian, 24 years after he left his home town for Central Saint Martins. \"Come in,&#xa0;sit down, would you like a&#xa0;cup of tea?\"</p> <p>It is 15 years since Williamson burst on to the scene with Electric Angels, a catwalk debut that took him as close to overnight success as the relatively small-fry world of British fashion gets. It was 1997, and out of the dying embers of grunge and minimalism came Williamson's visual explosion of Indian pinks and Ibizan attitude. Fifteen years later \u2013 and in triumphant defiance of&#xa0;the odds on longevity for 25-year-olds who find&#xa0;instant fame and start hanging out with supermodels \u2013 Williamson is still a bold-faced name on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/london-fashion-week?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">London fashion week</a> schedule, with&#xa0;a team of 47 and flagship stores in London, New York and Dubai.</p> <p>He is celebrating his anniversary with a short film starring Sienna Miller, eight Royal Ballet ballerinas and a corps de ballet of models and It&#xa0;girls. The film, made in a 19-hour day of filming at the grand Cotswold house of <a href=\"http://www.aynhoepark.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Aynhoe Park</a>, tells the story of the past 15 years from the point of view of a 15-year-old Matthew, dreaming his career. It ends with his mum, played by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2057859/\" title=\"\">Andrea Riseborough</a>, standing at the bottom of a staircase and \"shouting me down for my dinner, and a boy who looks like a 15-year-old me who's fallen asleep on the bed, reading Vogue\".</p> <p>As a child, Williamson was confused when his sister said she wasn't sure if she wanted to be a&#xa0;nurse or a teacher. \"How could you not know? It was always so obvious to me. There was never any question. As soon as I knew what a fashion designer was, I knew that's what I&#xa0;was going to do.\" He says that this \"came from my relationship with my mother, who I just absolutely adore \u2013 always have. In what was quite a grey, industrial, middle-class environment, I watched how she used fashion to make herself feel better, to brighten things. And I&#xa0;suppose seeing how fashion did that for her, in some subliminal way I&#xa0;wanted to make beautiful clothes as a way of enriching her life.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396732434\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348672343016/Matthew-Williamsons-sprin-008.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Williamson's spring/summer 2013 show\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Williamson's spring/summer 2013 show.

That was partly why I was so determined to get down to Saint Martins.\" During Williamson's student years, his&#xa0;dad accepted \"that my being different wasn't something that had to be suppressed, or shunned. He's brilliant, my dad.\"</p> <p>Around his neck, Williamson wears a gold pendant he was given on his 40th birthday last year, which is engraved \"MW, love forever, Mum &amp; Dad\". Neither of his parents has missed a single catwalk show during his 15-year career. \"Nor an after-party,\" he adds, raising an eyebrow. He is very funny, in the Mancunian way: more dry asides than punchlines. Listening to the tape after the interview, he keeps making me laugh, but there are no actual jokes to transcribe. That was why his friends urged him to make a film with humour: \"I didn't want it to just be whimsical footage of girls wafting around in gorgeous dresses, because that's been done to death.\"</p> <p>Saint Martins didn't quite turn out to be the haven the teenage Williamson was expecting. \"I&#xa0;was 17, the youngest on a course of 60, and I was a bit too young for it. It was very unstructured, and I was a&#xa0;fish out of water, with everyone else doing conceptual fashion and me looking at photos of Rio carnival.\"</p> <p>In fashion folklore, Williamson leapt straight from Saint Martins to the Electric Angels catwalk show of September 1997, when the industry packed into a tiny studio to watch models including Kate Moss, Jade Jagger and Helena Christensen parade the 11 outfits that would make Williamson's name. But the real sliding-doors moment of his career came before, the night he met Joseph Velosa, his one-time lover and lifelong best friend and business partner. Home for the weekend from college, Williamson was in a Manchester bar: \"And this is the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays days, so everyone's in cagoules, and this guy walked in \u2013 very handsome, crisp shirt, white teeth...\" They fell in love and Velosa, who was studying for a philosophy degree, transferred from Manchester to King's College London to be with him. After Saint Martins, Williamson took a job at Monsoon, where the trips to India crystallised his aesthetic and his determination to have his own label. He handed in his notice, and he and Velosa headed to India. After buying standby tickets, they had \u00a390 in their backpacks. In India, they had some sample garments made, and \"when we got back to London it was Joseph who was pushing me, saying, 'You need to show those to Vogue.' Like any couple in love, we were proud of what the other did.\"</p> <p>So Williamson picked up Vogue, and looked down the masthead. \"I&#xa0;had no idea how I should do this. I&#xa0;saw the name [fashion editor] Plum Sykes and I&#xa0;thought that was such a nice name, so I sent her a postcard.\" Sykes called him up, he took in his clothes and they made their way into the pages of&#xa0;Vogue, and on to a shoot for Tatler, the day after which Jade Jagger called up asking if she could keep the skirt. Velosa, who answered the phone, told her no, but said she could buy it. (\"I&#xa0;was like, 'Give me the bloody phone \u2013 she can have the skirt!'\") Williamson and Jagger met up, hit it off, and when he mentioned doing a show, she offered to ask her friend Kate Moss to model with her. \"Kate came round and we sat on my bedsit floor and ate a McDonald's, and she pointed to the pink and turquoise dress and said, 'I'll do the show if I&#xa0;can wear that.' She saw something in the clothes. She's always had her eye on the next thing.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396732435\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348671874442/Matthew-Williamsons-debut-008.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Williamson's debut collection\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Moss (second right) and Jade Jagger (right) model Matthew Williamson's debut collection in 1997. Photograph: PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The model cast elevated industry reaction to&#xa0;the show, turning buzz into hype, but a&#xa0;misconception that annoys him is that having supermodel chums was how he got famous. \"Those girls weren't my mates at that point, at all. They just did the show because they liked the clothes.\" The importance of Jagger and, later, of his model-muse Sienna Miller is nothing by comparison with that of Velosa, he says. The&#xa0;pair split as a couple after 12 years, but&#xa0;\"we&#xa0;still have a&#xa0;brilliant relationship. I&#xa0;definitely wouldn't be where I am without him. He's probably more important in our success than me. And&#xa0;anyway, he's my best friend. I&#xa0;want to know him for ever.\" If he could save one possession from a&#xa0;fire, he says, it would be the watch he wears, a present from Velosa.</p> <p>The same quality that has brought Williamson success \u2013 a crystal-clear identity that centres around Ibiza, India, colour, jetset and glamour \u2013 has also brought him angst. \"At times it is suffocating and frustrating. People have such preconceptions of what we're about that even when there's nothing Indian or ethnic in the collection, they still put the same things in the reviews. I'm not putting out on the runway things that are changing the shape of fashion. I know that, and I'm cool with that. But there's still an enormous amount of skill involved. I like to look on the brighter side of things, but that doesn't mean there's no thought process. It's like a&#xa0;butterfly wing: the beauty may look flighty and natural, but it's incredibly precise and ordered.\"</p> <p>There is solace to be found in the fact that, although there will be long periods when sexy party dresses are cold-shouldered by the grandes dames of fashion, the customer still wants them. For his collection at this month's London fashion week, \"I thought, sod it, people bang on about India whatever I do, so instead of fighting it, I'm going to do India.\" Critics liked it almost as much as the buyers, who have never wavered.</p> <p>The dream to become a famous fashion designer having come true, Williamson is in uncharted territory \u2013 \"This is as far as my plan went. So, now what?\" He describes his life as \"at a&#xa0;nice level of fame. Fashion's quite niche, so it's all on a very manageable level. If I'm queueing in Starbucks, someone might come and say hello and ask for a picture. I love it when that happens. How brilliant, that someone wants a picture of me?\"</p> <p>Together with Velosa, he owns 52% of his business. In the next two months, the pair will visit Lagos, Shanghai, Qatar, Hong Kong, Dubai and Rome on business. Williamson is \"on a break\" from his latest beau, the model <a href=\"http://stormmodels.com/StephenBaccari.html?boardId=1006\" title=\"\">Stephen Baccari</a>, \"so I'm a one man and his dog, at the moment,\" he says.</p> <p>We both turn to admire his glossy American cocker spaniel, who has been lounging on an Aztec throw in a corner of the sofa. I ask her name. \"Coco,\" he says. As in Chanel? \"Yes, which is tragic, I know. I'm such a clich\u00e9.\" He laughs, sounding perfectly content.</p>",
  "<p>It was the world's worst offshore oil spill: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">5m barrels spewing from the BP-run Deepwater Horizon rig into the Gulf of Mexico</a>, killing 11 people, marine life and devastating hundreds of miles of coastline. From a Cessna floatplane 3,000ft above the Louisiana coastline, photographer Daniel Beltr\u00e1 captured the carnage. It was only from this height, he said, that the magnitude of the spill \u2013 and the futility of the clean-up operation \u2013 became apparent. \"It was like trying to clean an Olympic pool full of oil while sitting on the side using Q-tips.\"</p> <p>An environmental specialist who often works for Greenpeace, Beltr\u00e1 prefers aerial photography, because it offers a humbling perspective, shrinking the scale of the planet to more human proportions and thereby revealing its fragility. This lofty viewpoint often shows the beauty of the natural world: in the case of a&nbsp;disaster, though, that can be unsettling. Here, the surface of the ocean is marbled with spectacular, iridescent blue and flashes of orange that resemble molten rock, and the rig, at first glance, might be a Hindu temple.</p> <p>In the two years since the wellhead was sealed, the fallout has continued. BP has embarked on a selling spree of oilfields and refineries in an attempt to raise funds for the clean-up bill \u2013&nbsp;estimated at $38bn. The company is working towards a settlement with the US government, with both sides trying to establish how much damage was done, and how much BP should pay.</p> <p>The environment is counting the cost, too. Most recently, waves caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/aug/29/hurricane-isaac-new-orleans-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Hurricane Isaac in August </a>dumped oil from the spill on two Louisiana beaches. Beltr\u00e1, meanwhile, is documenting low levels of sea ice in the Arctic. He is one photographer unlikely to be out of work any time soon.<em> </em></p> <p>\u2022 Spill is on show at the Prix Pictet/Power exhibition at the <a href=\"http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Saatchi Gallery</a>, London SW3, from 10-28 October.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>My employer is so nice I feel guilty about handing in my notice</strong></h2> <p><strong>I recently started at a company which I am enjoying compared with the last two, which were nightmares. </strong></p> <p><strong>My current company is totally different, and I feel bad but am looking to move away as I am still living at home. I have only been with the firm for two months. I am doing well, but have to leave the area to further my career and life in general.</strong></p> <p><strong>I feel I am being unfair to employers who have been so nice, and I will feel guilty handing in my notice. Should I be offered the job for which I am soon to be interviewed, what would your advice be? Would you recommend I ask my new employers to contact my current employer for a reference?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>The first and most obvious point to make is one you already know: don't count your chickens. Unless, and until, you have a firm offer from this company you're soon to be interviewed by, don't let a hint of your intentions slip out. The worst thing of all would be for your current excellent employers to catch a whiff of what you were up to, and then for you not to get the job.</p> <p>I'm glad you feel a bit guilty about handing in your notice; I think you should have been able to foresee your need to move away. Having said that, you must not allow guilt to dissuade you from taking up a better job if and when offered. But do be quite exceptionally open with, and grateful to, your current employer. If your new job permits, offer to help find your replacement and stay on long enough to effect a smooth transition.</p> <p>The question of references may be out of your hands. If at all typical, your new boss will almost certainly want a reference, and probably before your contract's finally signed. So don't let anything that your current boss might say come as a surprise. You already risk being thought a bit unreliable. Don't give them any reason to believe you're devious or deceitful as well.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Presumably this job has a probationary period? If you leave after two months (or three) for something better, or more suited to you, I don't think it would look bad. <strong>lporter</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Never quit a job unless you've got a new one lined up in this economic climate. Never. <strong>StueLDUK</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Is it a good idea to uproot on two fronts at the same time? New job and new living environment at once may be a challenge too far. Continue living at home for a while, save some money, get some valuable experience in a job you appear to like. Then apply for another job next year? <strong>farawayfromleeds</strong></p> <h2><strong>I went into teaching but it's not for me. What can I do now?</strong></h2> <p><strong>I have a 2.1 degree in economics, and after graduating went into teaching. I chose to train as a maths teacher, but since my degree was not in mathematics I did a six-month maths enhancement course, and subsequently got a place on a local graduate teaching programme (GTP).</strong></p> <p><strong>However, my school placement did not turn out to be great. I ended up with a very unsupportive maths faculty and a mentor with whom I could not agree on anything. To make matters worse, the school was given a \"notice to improve\". The local teaching authority in charge of the GTP could not find me another school and I was advised to withdraw from the course, so decided to quit.</strong></p> <p><strong>I had hoped to get more experience and apply for a PGCE some time in the future. I moved to London and ended up getting a job as a cover supervisor in a secondary school. I've been here for two years and come to realise that, after seeing what teachers go through in a modern inner-city comprehensive, teaching is not what I want to do.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am quite passionate about working in business, the private sector, government policymaking (civil service) etc. With my economics/maths background I think I can offer so much, but feel I'm stuck. I am generally confused as to what I should apply for, or where I take my career from here. I don't think I can commit two years to teaching (PGCE &amp; NQT) just for the sake of having a qualification.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>Can you remember why, all those years ago, you chose economics as your degree subject? There must have been some enthusiasm there \u2013 yet oddly you never seem to have pursued it. The moment you got your degree, you elected to go into teaching, which meant getting a maths qualification. Now, some years on, you've come to the conclusion that teaching's not for you \u2013 but feel \"quite passionate about working in business, private sector, government policymaking (civil-service) etc\". I have to say, these alternatives don't immediately seem to have a great deal in common.</p> <p>The mistake I believe you're making is a familiar one. You're confusing a degree in a given subject with an aptitude; while the first may certainly contribute to the second, they're not at all the same thing. Employers don't want people just because they've got a degree. They see a degree as objective evidence that an individual has certain basic levels of intelligence and diligence, but beyond that they want people who can do things; have skills and abilities; who make things happen.</p> <p>When you say that with your economics/maths background you feel you've much to offer, your confusion on this point is clear, and I think it also goes some way to explaining your general confusion about a career path.</p> <p>So forget about your qualifications for a moment and concentrate on your aptitudes. Teaching doesn't just demand an aptitude for teaching; or, put it another way, an aptitude for teaching is made up of many subsidiary aptitudes. What were your strong points? What gave you the greatest personal satisfaction? What do you do in your own time? Confronted with a task, what would spark your keenest interest?</p> <p>When you've answered these sorts of questions, honestly and imaginatively, you'll be in a much better position to know what kinds of employers would benefit most from having you. Once you know that, applying becomes quite a lot less difficult.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It sounds like you don't have a clue what you want to do, and you've flown with the wind with regards to your job roles. Either dump it all and do something that really motivates you or just find a relatively well-paid, stable, comfortable job, and get on with life outside of work.<strong> fracturedpelvis</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It is difficult to give advice to someone who has more to say about what they don't want to do than what they want to do. Use the research skills you developed in your degree and trawl through the job ads so you can develop a clearer picture. Once you have a better idea of employment opportunities you find attractive, don't necessarily wait for companies to advertise, be more proactive. <strong>justamug</strong></p> <p><strong>For Jeremy's and readers' advice on a work issue, send a brief email to </strong><a href=\"mailto:dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\" title=\"dear.jeremy@theguardian.com\"><strong>dear.jeremy@theguardian.com</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Some staples of our common culture are so established, so embedded in the collective consciousness, we think we know them even if we don't. Everyone knows Shakespeare, Dickens or the Beatles, even if they haven't seen one of the plays, read the books or played the music in years, if ever. They somehow linger in the air, ready to be imbibed as if by osmosis.</p> <p>So it is with James Bond, perhaps the single best-known literary character of the 20th century. Everyone thinks they know James Bond. The terms \u2013 M, 007, licence to kill \u2013 have not just entered the English language, they are part of a global common currency, readily understood across the planet. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony-danny-boyle-father\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle sought to project Britain to the global television audience watching the Olympic opening ceremony this summer</a>, he needed only to cast two individuals, each as mythic as the other, in a single scene: Queen Elizabeth II and James Bond.</p> <p>More substantially, <a href=\"http://www.ianfleming.com/\" title=\"\">Ian Fleming</a>'s novels have become a template handily available to those who seek to explain aspects of our world. Any news story that touches, however obliquely, on intelligence will sooner or later feature the phrase \"real-life James Bond\", even if only to explain that this or that spy was, in fact, nothing like James Bond. Beyond espionage, any public figure who combines grandiose ambition, perceived malign purpose and memorable idiosyncrasy will eventually be likened to a \"Bond villain\".</p> <p>Such an allusion requires no explanation. One need only to have come into contact with one of Bond's countless imitators \u2013 or parodies \u2013 to get the idea. There might well be a cohort of younger readers who think that, because they have seen the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/\" title=\"\">Austin Powers</a> movies or <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317705/\" title=\"\"><em>The Incredibles</em></a> (the 2004 animated feature that paid repeated homage to 007), they have no need to acquaint themselves with the real thing. In an equivalent impulse, there will be many more who think they have seen the films and so need not pick up the books.</p> <p>Both groups would be making a mistake, on a par with thinking that because you once saw a Beatles tribute band you can skip <em>Sgt Pepper</em>. Readers of every stripe have good reason to return to the source from which this extraordinary cultural phenomenon sprang: the books of Ian Fleming.</p> <p>For one thing, they yield an unexpectedly rich insight into an era now long gone. One drawback of the timelessness of Bond \u2013 maintained by a movie franchise that keeps 007 in a permanent present \u2013 is how easy it is to forget that Fleming was writing in, and therefore about, a very specific period. Postwar Britain, to be sure, but also a Britain caught between the dusk of empire and the dawn of decline. Bond sits intriguingly on that cusp.</p> <p>So, yes, he is an imperial archetype: adventurer, explorer and, as he puts it, \"a sort of policeman\", ready to meddle in faraway places to lethal effect. But Fleming also knows that the muscles of empire are atrophying by the time Bond gets to work. The tell comes early, in the debut novel <a href=\"http://www.vintage-books.co.uk/books/0099576856/ian-fleming/casino-royale/\" title=\"\"><em>Casino Royale</em></a>, published in 1953. Our hero duels the wicked communist Le Chiffre across the baccarat table. But, for all his skill, the former commander in the Royal Navy loses and is bankrupted \u2013 saved only by an emergency bailout from the CIA, in the form of a cash-filled envelope \"as thick as a dictionary\", handed to 007 at the critical moment and bearing the unambiguous message: \"Marshall Aid. Thirty two million francs. With the compliments of the USA.\" No doubt who's top dog now.</p> <p>Fleming tacitly concedes the new international hierarchy in the plotting of the sixth novel, <a href=\"http://www.vintage-books.co.uk/books/0099576929/ian-fleming/dr-no/\" title=\"\"><em>Dr No</em></a>: what gives the villain's evil scheme punch is that its target is the missile programme of the mighty United States. The author knows that in 1958, two years after Suez had confirmed London's diminished global standing, a conspiracy against Britain alone would not be enough: the plot has to involve the US, ideally drawing in the Soviet Union and the cold war.</p> <p>This geopolitical landscape should draw in the historically minded reader, for it is a world that has passed now, just as the empire of <a href=\"http://www.johnbuchansociety.co.uk/\" title=\"\">John Buchan</a>'s novels was crumbling when Fleming took to his typewriter. Students of the changing relationship between men and women, and the advances won by a half-century of feminism, will also find much to seize on in the books' parade of gorgeous, eager women, usually positioned to catch Bond's eye. Naivete is a common trait, a crucial one in the case of Tatiana Romanova, deployed as bait in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Russia-Love-Vintage-Classics/dp/0099576899\" title=\"\"><em>From Russia with Love</em></a>. Honeychile Rider is even more unworldly, depicted in <em>Dr No</em> as part intuitive animal, part innocent child. She is, as we would expect from a Bond girl, a fantasy figure \u2013 curvaceous, unspoiled and, as her name promises, sexually eager. \"You've got to wash me,\" she implores Bond once they are alone in the \"mink-lined prison\" No has set aside for them. \"I don't know what to do. You've got to show me.\" (She is also the object of that recurring Fleming interest in what might be nudgingly referred to as discipline. \"Honey, get into that bath before I spank you,\" Bond warns.)</p> <p>There is guilty pleasure in all this, the same guilty thrill so profitably exploited by the creators of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\" title=\"\">TV series <em>Mad Men</em></a>. For Bond offers the opportunity to glimpse, even to revel in, how things used to be before progress and equality spoiled all the fun. Few contemporary thriller writers would risk a hero who treats women the way Bond does, but that was then: different rules apply.</p> <p>Similarly, 21st-century audiences are often told they want their stories dark and brooding, their heroes filled with angst. But Bond appeals partly because he, and therefore we, dwell so rarely on his inner life (though the seventh novel, <a href=\"http://www.vintage-books.co.uk/books/0099576937/ian-fleming/goldfinger/\" title=\"\"><em>Goldfinger</em></a>, introduces a more introspective 007). He is no cipher: we know there are \"phantoms\" that haunt him. But mention of them is usually fleeting, just enough to keep us intrigued. He is instead a man of action, capable of doing extraordinary things very well. And people will always long to see that.</p> <p>In this age of confession, where almost every public figure feels the need to make himself more real by admitting to vulnerability, weakness and self-doubt, Bond's certainty is compelling. \"His cause was just,\" the author tells us, when describing 007's sense of elation as he embarks on a mission. Fleming feels no great obligation to explain that confidence, just as Bond rarely feels the need to question the rights and wrongs of the task M has handed him. It is enough that he is serving his country and his Queen.</p> <p>Few of us can imagine such iron certainty now. Fleming was writing before Vietnam and Watergate, before scepticism towards our governmental masters congealed into outright cynicism, before thrillers became laced with paranoia and deep, dark ambivalence. The Bond novels return us to a world of courage, ingenuity and moral clarity \u2013 and do it with consummate \u00e9lan.</p> <p>Fleming never forgets that a thriller has to thrill; that, whatever else it does, it must entertain. Central to such fiction's magic is the promise of escape. When <em>Casino Royale</em> appeared, rationing still had a year to run in Britain. To a readership still trudging through a drab, grey country exhausted by war and austerity, Fleming offered the prospect of azure skies, powder-white beaches, stunning women and handsome men. When jet travel was still a novelty and foreign tourism still off limits to all but the wealthiest, how exotically enticing must have sounded Jamaica's north coast, Miami or Istanbul. To the Brits back home, heads down against the rain, \"their legs whipped by the wet hems of their macintoshes\", a Bond novel was a ticket to distant joys.</p> <p>And here we are again, in the early 21st century, in our very own age of austerity. That successive generations keep trying to follow where Bond led, imitating and copying him, only proves that our need for 007 endures. As every villain should know by now, James Bond is a man who can appear to die a thousand deaths \u2013 but cannot be killed.</p> <p>\u2022 The entire series of James Bond books is being reissued as Vintage Classics. Jonathan Freedland's novel <em>Pantheon, </em>under the pseudonym Sam Bourne, is published by Harper.</p>",

The stench and heart-wrenching piles of small, familiar possessions, all ruined, are the dominant impression; but with them comes the spirit of communities determined to get something done and impressively knowledgeable about the local causes of flooding: moorland run-off at Hebden Bridge or new housing in the floodplain south of Preston, even a specific, badly maintained pinch in a watercourse at Flimby on the Cumbrian coast north of Workington.</p> <p>This community spirit, multiplied 150 times, powers the groups which make up the <a href=\"http://www.floodforum.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Flood Forum</a>. Yet only in July, its chair, Charles Tucker, surveyed the bleak landscape of 294 defence schemes abandoned or delayed by public spending cuts \u2013 including one due at Morpeth, which was flooded in 2008 and again this week \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\" title=\"\">accused the government</a> of \"wringing its hands while the waters rise\".</p> <p>Wringing out the soaking landscape would make so much more sense: meeting the threat of further flooding with the resource of much-trumpeted localism, and a heaven-sent chance to trial some Keynesian public spending which is tempting politicians as the recession grinds on. Flood defences have an exceptional record in this regard: they are unsuited to private sector involvement, as the Green Investment Bank acknowledges by ruling them out because of the<a href=\"http://www.myfloodrisk.info/2011/06/green-investment-bank-will-not-arrange.html\" title=\"\"> lack of revenue streams</a> \u2013 something that helped Roosevelt ward off inevitable cries of \"socialism\".</p> <p>We don't have to look back to Keynes or Tennessee to get the point. Hop on London's Docklands Light Railway down to Woolwich Arsenal and spend a day at the <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/38353.aspx\" title=\"\">Thames Barrier</a>.

  "<p>Throughout the 1980s and 90s, when many developing countries were in crisis and borrowing money from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\" title=\"\">International Monetary Fund</a>, waves of protests in those countries became known as the \"IMF riots\". They were so called because they were sparked by the fund's structural adjustment programmes, which imposed austerity, privatisation and deregulation.</p> <p>The IMF complained that calling these riots thus was unfair, as it had not caused the crises and was only prescribing a medicine, but this was largely self-serving. Many of the crises had actually been caused by the asset bubbles built up following IMF-recommended financial deregulation. Moreover, those rioters were not just expressing general discontent but reacting against the austerity measures that directly threatened their livelihoods, such as cuts in subsidies to basic commodities such as food and water, and cuts in already meagre welfare payments.</p> <p>The IMF programme, in other words, met such resistance because its designers had forgotten that behind the numbers they were crunching were real people. These criticisms, as well as the ineffectiveness of its economic programme, became so damaging that the IMF has made a lot of changes in the past decade or so. It has become more cautious in pushing for financial deregulation and austerity programmes, renamed its structural adjustment programmes as poverty reduction programmes, and has even (marginally) increased the voting shares of the developing countries in its decision-making.</p> <p>Given these recent changes in the IMF, it is ironic to see the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/sep/28/blame-austerity-mania-breaks-euro\" title=\"\">European governments inflicting an old-IMF-style programme</a> on their own populations. It is one thing to tell the citizens of some faraway country to go to hell but it is another to do the same to your own citizens, who are supposedly your ultimate sovereigns. Indeed, the European governments are out-IMF-ing the IMF in its austerity drive so much that now the fund itself frequently issues the warning that Europe is going too far, too fast.</p> <p>The threat to livelihoods has reached such a dimension that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/europe-austerity-protests-mad-hell\" title=\"\">renewed bouts of rioting</a> are now rocking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/26/greece-general-strike-austerity-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Greece</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/spain-europe-news\" title=\"\">Spain</a> and even the usually quieter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/portugal-austerity-mannered-populace?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Portugal</a>. In the case of Spain, its national integrity is threatened by the separatist demand made by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/spain-heads-towards-confrontation-catalan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Catalan</a> nationalists, who think the austerity policy is unfairly reducing the region's autonomy.</p> <p>Even if these and other European countries (for other countries have not been free of protests against austerity programmes, such as Britain's university fees riot and the protests by Italy's \"recession widows\") survive this social unrest through a mixture of heavy-handed policing and political delaying tactics, recent events raise a very serious question about the nature of European politics.</p> <p>What has been happening in Europe \u2013 and indeed the US in a more muted and dispersed form \u2013 is nothing short of a complete rewriting of the implicit social contracts that have existed since the end of the second world war. In these contracts, renewed legitimacy was bestowed on the capitalist system, once totally discredited following the great depression. In return it provided a welfare state that guarantees minimum provision for all those burdens that most citizens have to contend with throughout their lives \u2013 childcare, education, health, unemployment, disability and old age.</p> <p>Of course there is nothing sacrosanct about any of the details of these social contracts. Indeed, the contracts have been modified on the margins all the time. However, the rewriting in many European countries is an unprecedented one. It is not simply that the scope and the speed of the cuts are unusually large. It is more that the rewriting is being done through the back door.</p> <p>Instead of it being explicitly cast as a rewriting of the social contract, changing people's entitlements and changing the way the society establishes its legitimacy, the dismembering of the welfare state is presented as a technocratic exercise of \"balancing the books\". Democracy is neutered in the process and the protests against the cuts are dismissed. The description of the externally imposed Greek and Italian governments as \"technocratic\" is the ultimate proof of the attempt to make the radical rewriting of the social contract more acceptable by pretending that it isn't really a political change.</p> <p>The danger is not only that these austerity measures are killing the European economies but also that they threaten the very legitimacy of European democracies \u2013 not just directly by threatening the livelihoods of so many people and pushing the economy into a downward spiral, but also indirectly by undermining the legitimacy of the political system through this backdoor rewriting of the social contract. Especially if they are going to have to go through long tunnels of economic difficulties in coming years, and in the context of global shifts in economic power balance and of severe environmental challenges, European countries can ill afford to have the legitimacy of their political systems damaged in this way.</p>",

But if they persist in their willful indifference to a crisis that is close to engulfing not only society, but a political system which legitimises the commercialisation of public services, the closure of refuges and children's services and the slashing of benefits, while financial corruption goes unchecked, they can hardly say that they were not warned.<br><strong>Mike Cowley</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>\u2022 The problem with Polly Toynbee's thesis (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/labour-may-be-better-in-coalition?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 28 September) that the last Labour government would have been better in coalition with the Lib Dems, is based on a false premise, ie that they would pursue policies in government with Labour that they voted for in opposition. All the evidence from the last two years shows this to be false. On the core economic issue, in opposition, they always wanted higher levels of expenditure; yet in government they have supported ineffective Thatcherite monetarist polices. There can be, therefore, little confidence that on key issues such as Iraq and Trident, the Lib Dems would not have performed similar political acrobatics. Listening carefully to the Lib Dem leadership at their conference justifying their current participation in coalition it is absolutely clear that power is more important to them than principle.

The big lie behind austerity is that without it we would be in the same boat as the Greeks. But we had a choice and the Tories chose austerity instead of progressive taxation to give themselves the pretext for privatising the NHS &#xa0;and removing the welfare safety net. Clegg's excuse of reforming the House of Lords in return for putting them in power has been blown out of the water, and he has no right to trade his party for the post of deputy Prime Minister.

  "<p>The UK has come a step nearer losing its AAA credit rating after one of the big three ratings agencies warned that rising debts and slowing growth jeopardised its status as a safe haven for investors.</p> <p>Fitch said the likelihood of a downgrade had increased after the economy's poor performance over the last year during which it has slipped back into recession.</p> <p>The ratings agency pointed out that the UK had a debt mountain second only to the US among those countries with a AAA rating and was nearing the upper limit the agency set for the most creditworthy countries.</p> <p>Fitch praised the UK for maintaining \"a high-income, diversified and flexible economy as well as robust institutions and a high degree of political and social stability\".</p> <p>But it said a deterioration in the global economy and the government's struggle to balance the budget by 2015 had increased the likelihood of a downgrade. It warned against any plans to ease up on the government's austerity measures that could increase the current deficit.</p> <p>\"Global economic headwinds, including those blowing from the on-going eurozone crisis, have compounded the drag on UK growth from private sector deleveraging and fiscal consolidation as well as from depressed business and consumer confidence, weak investment, and constrained credit growth,\" it said.</p> <p>\"Fitch now expects the economy to contract by 0.3% in 2012 compared to an expectation of growth of 0.8% when the UK sovereign rating was last formally reviewed in March 2012.

  "<p>Steve Kean resigned as the manager of Blackburn Rovers on Friday night after deciding his position had become \"untenable\" and he was in effect being \"forced out\". It is understood Venky's, the club's Indian owners, attempted to influence team selection ahead of Saturday's trip to Charlton.</p> <p>Kean had been in charge at Ewood Park for almost two troubled years and his tenure was notable principally for regular protests by disgruntled fans, disappointing results and relegation from the Premier League in May. While Tim Sherwood, a former Blackburn midfielder, now coaching at Spurs, has been installed as the favourite to succeed him, it would be a major surprise were Alan Shearer, another former Rover, to swap the BBC sofa for his old haunt. Kean's assistant, Eric Black, will be in charge at Charlton.</p> <p>It did not help that Kean was regarded as a puppet of Venky's, which promoted him from a coaching role at the expense of the sacked Sam Allardyce in December 2010 shortly after buying Blackburn.</p> <p>With the team third in the Championship it appears an unusual moment to quit but Kean, who was allowed to spend \u00a38m on signing the striker Jordan Rhodes from Huddersfield last month, felt he had no alternative.</p> <p>\"For reasons I cannot discuss on legal advice, it is with deep regret, given my hard work and service for the club for a number of years that I have been forced to resign as manager with immediate effect due to my position as team manager becoming untenable,\" said Kean in a statement issued through his lawyers. \"I wish to thank all the players and coaching staff for their great support and the majority of the fans, who now see their club heading towards an automatic promotion position back to the Premiership. I wish the club all the very best for the future.\"</p> <p>If Kean's agent Jerome Anderson, head of the SEM group which advised Venky's on player recruitment, helped him secure the job, a friendship established between Anuradha Desai, the club's co-owner, and Kean's wife, Margaret, arguably helped keep him in it in the face of frequent supporter outrage.</p> <p>Even so Blackburn's manager was forced to make monthly trips to Venky's base in the hills above Pune in India to discuss progress and events took a humiliating turn when Rovers appointed Shebby Singh as their global adviser. In August Singh apologised to the manager after saying Kean would be sacked if he lost three successive games.</p> <p>Singh also said that Kean required 16 points from Blackburn's first seven games to survive. He secured 14 and earlier this week the global adviser said Kean's situation was deteriorating \"by the day\".</p> <p>The club's managing director, Derek Shaw, said Venky's were \"very disappointed\" by Kean's resignation.</p> <p>\"It was completely unexpected. He travelled down with the team ahead of our game at Charlton but he must have been giving it an awful lot of thought owing to the pressure he's been under,\" Shaw said. \"I have spoken with Anuradha Desai and she is very disappointed as she was close with Steve.\"</p> <p>Claiming \"liberation\", the Blackburn Rovers Action Group were quick to respond to the news. Their secretary, Mark Fish, said: \"I am delighted. It's been a long 12 months for all involved and I never thought I'd see the day when he went. The supporters are liberated and free of Steve Kean. I am just enjoying the fact that he has gone.</p> <p>\"He has treated the supporters with contempt. We've got 8,000 to 9,000 boycotting and empty seats are one thing he can't mask. I have longed for this.\"</p>",
  "<p>Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party is increasingly assuming the role of law enforcement officers on the streets of the bankrupt country, with mounting evidence that Athenians are being openly directed by police to seek help from the neo-Nazi group, analysts, activists and lawyers say.</p> <p>In return, a growing number of Greek crime victims have come to see the party, whose symbol bears an uncanny resemblance to the swastika, as a \"protector\".</p> <p>One victim of crime, an eloquent US-trained civil servant, told the Guardian of her family's shock at being referred to the party when her mother recently called the police following an incident involving Albanian immigrants in their downtown apartment block.</p> <p>\"They immediately said if it's an issue with immigrants go to Golden Dawn,\" said the 38-year-old, who fearing for her job and safety, spoke only on condition of anonymity. \"We don't condone Golden Dawn but there is an acute social problem that has come with the breakdown of feeling of security among lower and middle class people in the urban centre,\" she said. \"If the police and official mechanism can't deliver and there is no recourse to justice, then you have to turn to other maverick solutions.\"</p> <p>Other Greeks with similar experiences said the far-rightists, catapulted into parliament on a ticket of tackling \"immigrant scum\" were simply doing the job of a defunct state that had left a growing number feeling overwhelmed by a \"sense of powerlessness\". \"Nature hates vacuums and Golden Dawn is just filling a vacuum that no other party is addressing,\" one woman lamented. \"It gives 'little people' a sense that they can survive, that they are safe in their own homes.\"</p> <p>Far from being tamed, parliamentary legitimacy appears only to have emboldened the extremists. In recent weeks racially-motivated attacks have proliferated. Immigrants have spoken of their fear of roaming the streets at night following a spate of attacks by black-clad men on motorbikes. Street vendors from Africa and Asia have also been targeted.</p> <p>\"For a lot of people in poorer neighbourhoods we are liberators,\" crowed Yiannis Lagos, one of 18 MPs from the stridently patriot \"popular nationalist movement\" to enter the 300-seat house in June. \"The state does nothing,\" he told a TV chat show, adding that Golden Dawn was the only party that was helping Greeks, hit by record levels of poverty and unemployment, on the ground. Through an expansive social outreach programme, which also includes providing services to the elderly in crime-ridden areas, the group regularly distributes food and clothes parcels to the needy.</p> <p>But the hand-outs come at a price: allegiance to Golden Dawn. \"A friend who was being seriously harassed by her husband and was referred to the party by the police very soon found herself giving it clothes and food in return,\" said a Greek teacher, who, citing the worsening environment enveloping the country, again spoke only on condition of anonymity. \"She's a liberal and certainly no racist and is disgusted by what she has had to do.\"</p> <p>The strategy, however, appears to be paying off. On the back of widespread anger over biting austerity measures that have also hit the poorest hardest, the popularity of the far-rightists has grown dramatically with polls indicating a surge in support for the party.</p> <p>One survey last week showed a near doubling in the number of people voicing \"positive opinions\" about Golden Dawn, up from 12% in May to 22%. The popularity of Nikos Michaloliakos, the party's rabble-rousing leader had shot up by 8 points, much more than any other party leader.</p> <p>Paschos Mandravelis, a prominent political analyst, attributed the rise in part to the symbiotic relationship between the police and Golden Dawn. \"Greeks haven't turned extremist overnight. A lot of the party's backing comes from the police, young recruits who are a-political and know nothing about the Nazis or Hitler,\" he said. \"For them, Golden Dawn supporters are their only allies on the frontline when there are clashes between riot police and leftists.\"</p> <p>Riding the wave, the party has taken steps to set up branches among diaspora Greek communities abroad, opening an office in New York last week. Others are expected to open in Australia and Canada. Cadres say they are seeing particular momentum in support from women.</p> <p>With Greeks becoming ever more radicalised, the conservative-led government has also clamped down on illegal immigration, detaining thousands in camps and increasing patrols along the country's land and sea frontier with Turkey.</p> <p>But in an environment of ever increasing hate speech and mounting tensions, the party's heavy-handedness is also causing divisions. A threat by Golden Dawn to conduct raids against vendors attending an annual fair in the town of Arta this weekend has caused uproar.</p> <p>\"They say they have received complaints about immigrant vendors from shop owners here but that is simply untrue,\" said socialist mayor Yiannis Papalexis. \"Extra police have been sent down from Athens and if they come they will be met by leftists who have said they will beat them up with clubs. I worry for the stability of my country.\"</p> <p>Seated in her office beneath the Acropolis, Anna Diamantopoulou, a former EU commissioner, shakes her head in disbelief. Despair, she says, has brought Greece to a dangerous place.</p> <p>\"I never imagined that something like Golden Dawn would happen here, that Greeks could vote for such people,\" she sighed. \"This policy they have of giving food only to the Greeks and blood only to the Greeks. The whole package is terrifying. This is a party based on hate of 'the other'. Now 'the other' is immigrants, but who will 'the other' be tomorrow?\"</p>",

Does it draw a line under the whole affair? I don't think it does,\" said Kevin Lapwood, an analyst at Seymour Pierce.</p> <p>Keith Vaz, chair of the home affairs select committee, which has twice hauled Buckles over the coals, said Taylor-Smith and Horseman Sewell had paid the \"ultimate price\" by resigning but said it was \"not the end of the matter\". \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keith_VazMP/status/251592288457859072\" title=\"\">It's not closure. They must waive their fee and pay compensation,\"</a> he said via Twitter.</p> <p>The home affairs select committee is calling for G4S, which is expecting to lose \u00a350m on the \u00a3284m Olympic contract, to waive its \u00a357m management fee for the contract. Connolly said G4S is negotiating with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog).</p> <p>\"It's clear G4S let the country down in all the preparations for Olympic security. It turned into a fiasco. This was an 11th hour move and if it had not been for the government, Locog and the ministry of defence we would not have had this splendid Olympic Games,\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19756570#?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">Vaz told the BBC</a>.</p> <p>He added he was concerned that Buckles knew that G4S would not be able to provide enough staff for the Olympics but \"didn't bother\" to tell Theresa May, the home secretary.</p> <p>\"He knew something was wrong the day before they basically told everyone that they didn't have enough people but he had a meeting with the home secretary [and] didn't bother to tell her,\" he said.</p> <p>Vaz said he was \"very interested to know what [payoff] package\" Taylor-Smith and Horseman Sewell would be collecting. \"I can't believe they have resigned and not been given some kind of compensation. I just hope if they have been given compensation G4S remembers there is unfinished business here: we need to make sure others are compensated.\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Keith_VazMP/status/251645622329937920\" title=\"\">On Twitter, Vaz added: \"The only senior officials at G4S who have resigned are those with double barrel names. Need to know what the resignation package.\" </a></p> <p>G4S refused to state exactly how much payoff the resigning executives will collect and their pay is not disclosed in the company's annual report.</p> <p>Connolly reiterated that Buckles, who has worked for G4S for 27 years, had promised to forfeit his annual bonus for the second year running.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/21/american-dream-peoples-panel\">we asked you if it's still possible</a> to believe that hard work equates to economic success in this post-Madoff, post-Occupy, post-Libor, post-growth-of-an-ever-widening-income-gap-between-the-richest-and-the-poorest America? Is the promise of one of the nation's most treasured narratives nothing but a fantasy?</p> <p>Here are what a few of you had to say:</p> <h2>'An entire generation is waking up' \u2013 doctordrewl, San Diego</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870402\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/13/1305275171639/red-avatar-001.jpg\" alt=\"red avatar\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">red avatar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian/Guaridan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American dream is alive and well thanks to the internet. An entire generation of young people are waking up to the truths of the world \u2013&#xa0;many of which their parents, and the older generations, refuse to see or accept, despite overwhelming evidence. Based on this new information, we see that most of the world's problems are solveable. Most of the suffering is simply a byproduct of the greed and nepotism built into virtually all models of human control. Just like in 1776, this generation is prepared to cast of the ties that bind us to a sinking ship of necrotic culture that refuses to change. </p> <h2>'We are masters of our own fate' \u2013 Bonnie Wiley, Columbus, Ohio</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870403\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/17/1305645879944/blueavatar-001.jpg\" alt=\"blueavatar\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">blueavatar Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The one thing consistent about America over many other places is options. Nobody tells us where to live, what occupation to seek, what religion to believe (or not believe). Regardless of what the naysayers are now saying, we are still for the most part masters of our own fate. As you can see by the state of the economy, sometimes things don't work out. The Rolling Stones figured it out years ago: you can't always get what you want. With a little ingenuity and a willingness to improvise, adapt, and overcome, we can get what we need.</p> <h2>'A new system can replace the old' \u2013 @Eric_Bowen, North Carolina</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870404\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/30/1262172414554/avatar-purple-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar purple\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">avatar comment blue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A new economy is helping build the American dream from scratch. Patient-provider co-ops, food co-ops, locally-oriented (sometimes innovative and web-based) businesses are all part of a new system that can replace the old. Fixes to government and its intimacy with big business will remain difficult, but another crisis (like the eurozone crash) could force change.</p> <p>As more and more people join and start local co-ops, they are building a new world in the shell of the old. But two things could dramatically speed up this process: first, ending red-tape governance that strangles innovative new business structures and traditional small businesses; and second, striking down laws that help fuel speculation on Wall Street and increasingly cozy relationships between government and big business.</p> <h2>'It's still a land of great opportunity' \u2013 Subodh Jain Davis, California</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870405\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/12/30/1262172344336/avatar-environment-green-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar environment green\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">avatar environment green</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We need leaders, media moguls and local politicians who can boldly and honestly tell us about the limits on natural resources, be realistic on economic growth, and admit the failures in education and workplace organizations. We cannot simply promise the old American dream or world-winning strategies of the past. The United States is still a land of great opportunity with large majority of people believing in good citizenship and family obligations. With better political order we can still build meaningful and rewarding lives, and indeed find happiness.</p> <h2>'America needs a better vision' \u2013 Susan Olney, Maryland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396870406\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/10/1257875887351/Avatar-brown-001.jpg\" alt=\"Avatar brown\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar brown Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American dream should die.

  "<p>The way in which humans engage with, and respond to, the environment has undergone some significant developments in the last century. Major transformations in rapid industrialisation and urbanisation have continued to reinforce a sense of separation between society and nature, human and non-human worlds. It is arguably this sense of separation that has enabled society to capitalise on the fruits of science, industry and global economics. Conversely, it is also what underwrites the parallel dysfunction and destruction of our social and ecological systems.</p> <p>The world's ecological, social and economic crises are as much a crisis of spirit as a crisis of resources. Part of the crisis of spirit is because modern society and industry tends to perceive the Earth as a set of resources, and then values it as such. What scope is there for this paradigm to change in order to perceive the Earth as an animate, living system in which humans play a constructive, not destructive, part?</p> <p>In 2010 <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/\" title=\"\">The Royal Society of Arts</a> coined its new strapline: a 21st century enlightenment. Matthew Taylor, the society's director, proposes that the core ideals, values and norms that the initial Enlightenment enabled may no longer be adequate or fit for purpose for the challenges society faces. In order to live differently, he argues, we must think differently, and this relates to the way that we see ourselves in the world.</p> <p>Just as our need to transform business is now becoming apparent, so is our need to transform our engagement with, and response to, nature. Understanding our relationship with nature can help business to transform, and the patterns and principles of nature can provide insight into how best to future-proof companies for an unpredictable future.</p> <p>All organisations operate within a community \u2013 an environment of interconnections \u2013 as do the people within organisations. The age-old adage \"No man is an island\" is the same for an organisation. In fact, just like an ecosystem in nature, the more diverse the relationships and resources an organisation makes use of, the more resilient it becomes.</p> <p>In building a bridge between nature and business, we start to re-ignite our vital bond with nature.</p> <p><strong>What do organisations of the future look like?</strong></p> <p>Collaborative, innovative, networking, emergent, dynamic organisations more akin to living organisms. There are a plethora of nature's insights that can be applied to business \u2013 all that is lacking is the ability to convert these insights into a business frame. For example:</p> <p>\u2022 Mycelium networks provide insight for a responsive and adaptive organisation.</p> <p>\u2022 Nature (and business) is emergent and interconnected, not predictable and linear.</p> <p>\u2022 Nature does not do waste; waste of one is food for another.</p> <p>\u2022 Natural ecosystems develop niches where every aspect of the material throughput is used.</p> <p>A business inspired by nature is one that is resilient, optimising, adaptive, systems-based, values-led, and life supporting \u2013 these are \"nature's business principles\".</p> <p>These principles do not seek to reduce organisational behaviour to biology; rather, they suggest a set of behaviours and qualities that simply echo the law of the system \u2013 Earth \u2013 upon which our lives and our businesses depend. They recognise the complexity of human nature and nurture, and are neither a model nor a theory, but rather a philosophy that reminds us that, while humans are a special species on Earth, we are still part of nature and subject to its law. If we do not conduct our business within the constraints of the system, we will inevitably go out of business. The circular economy, industrial ecology, cradle-to-cradle, the learning organisation and bio-mimicry all share a common foundation: they take inspiration from nature.</p> <p>What is desperately lacking in today's framing of sustainable business, and for that matter wider business transformation, is a language and engagement approach for business people to unlock nature's wisdom and, in so doing, re-enchant ourselves with nature \u2013 re-establishing our vital bond with our environment.</p> <p>By framing experiences people have with nature and giving examples of business inspired by nature, we can reconnect business and nature. To do this, skills and expertise from multi-disciplines are needed: biology, eco-psychology and business change, for instance. This fusion of skillsets, with the right vision and mission, can help equip local, national and global business people with the wherewithal they need to adapt, innovate, embrace change and engage in meaningful business transformation towards a sustainable future.</p> <p><em>Giles Hutchin's new book 'The Nature of Business' can be purchased </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Nature-Business-Redesigning-Resilience/dp/0857840487\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em> <em>He has more than 15 years of business transformation experience and is embarking on a BBC/Open University documentary of the same title and subject as the book.

  "<p>Earlier this week, journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/24/yemen-foreign-aid-good-debate\" title=\"\">Abubakr al-Shamahi asked if aid was good for Yemen</a>. The answer to that question is an unequivocal yes \u2013 and that more, not less, is needed.</p> <p>For aid to make a difference though, we need to be smart about how it's used. That's why our focus at the <a href=\"http://www.sabanews.net/en/news282524.htm\" title=\"\">Friends of Yemen meeting in New York</a> on Thursday was on how to ensure a successful transition led by the government of Yemen, and on how the international community can best support that process.</p> <p>It's a big challenge and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/22/tackle-malnutrition-yemen-unicef\" title=\"\">human cost of Yemen's under-development is huge</a>. More than one in 10 children under five suffers from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/14/yemen-crisis-emergency-food-aid\" title=\"\">acute malnutrition</a>, and conflicts around the country have forced more than half a million civilians to leave their homes.</p> <p>In turn, this has led to political insecurity and further conflict as young men have seen no alternative but to take up arms. The weak economy means the only potential source of financing is aid, not only to tackle the humanitarian crisis in the short-term but \u2013 as Abubakr al-Shamahi noted \u2013 to tackle longer-term development needs.</p> <p>In Riyadh this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/06/money-yemen-humanitarian-crisis\" title=\"\">donors pledged $6.4bn for a combination of short and long-term assistance</a>. The process was driven in no small part by the UK, and I set out our commitment to spend \u00a3196m in Yemen from April 2012 to April 2015. That will deliver a package of support to urgently address Yemenis' basic needs such as healthcare, education and access to sanitation, as well as underpin the economy and direct funds into infrastructure, a longer-term investment which we agree is critical.</p> <p>We will continue to provide humanitarian relief that saves lives \u2013 in 2011, we provided 300,000 people with emergency food assistance, and between 2012 and 2015 we will improve the nutrition of 1.65 million women and children.</p> <p>However, there is also a clear need to strengthen and improve existing systems. Britain's support will enable at least 6.6 million people to vote in the constitutional referendum in 2013 and in the presidential election in 2014. We're also helping to provide Yemenis with jobs and access to finance and basic services. That is exactly the sort of investment in the future of Yemen that researcher and blogger Atiaf al-Wazir calls for in Abubakr al-Shamahi's report.</p> <p>We will do everything we can to strengthen government systems by working alongside them, but the primary aim of every pound we spend is to make tangible improvements to the lives of poor Yemenis. That doesn't mean, however, that we're not aware of the challenges of ensuring that aid reaches those who need it most.</p> <p>No British money is channelled through the government; it is all managed by trusted partners, whether UN agencies, international NGOs or Yemeni civil society organisations. We are clear that it would be wrong to punish people for having a weak government by withholding aid \u2013 and foolhardy not to address the lack of development that can foster a sense of injustice which can exacerbate conflict.</p> <p>Of course, aid alone cannot provide a secure and prosperous future for Yemen. The government's actions are critical. Its priority is to provide security for the people of Yemen and to achieve a peaceful democratic transition. However, other actions are also important to lay the foundation for future development and to ensure the country doesn't slip back into conflict.</p> <p>For the first time ever for Yemen, at the meeting in Riyadh at the start of the month, donors came together to say in detail how they are going to help and when they will deliver their aid. The government of Yemen is committed to a range of actions, including improving public financial management and the business climate, as well as to concerted action to tackle corruption. Progress on these areas will ensure that aid yields the best possible results.</p> <p>Yemen's future is too important \u2013 to the region, the world, and its own citizens \u2013 for any of us to ignore. Action is needed by the whole international community, from UN agencies; aid donors; international NGOs; and smaller organisations such as the Yemen Relief and Development Forum, which performs a vital role in building solidarity and drawing attention to the country's needs.</p> <p>That's why it was so encouraging to hear pledges of nearly $1.5bn in additional funding at the Friends of Yemen meeting from those who had not previously come forward at Riyadh.</p> <p>As I made clear at the meeting, however, the pledges are the easy part. Those promises must be turned into action, and both international donors and the government have a role to play.</p> <p>&#xa0;&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>Another week, another 20 new and notable iPhone and iPad apps appearing on Apple's App Store, with books and children's apps figuring prominently in this latest weekly selection.</p> <p>As ever, games aren't included, because there's a separate weekly roundup for them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/27/best-mobile-games-bad-piggies-fifa-13\">This week's post</a> includes iOS games like Bad Piggies, FIFA 13, God of Blades and Boomtime Baseball.</p> <p>Wondering where all the Android apps are? There's a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/28/best-android-apps-fieldtrip-zeebox\">separate post for them</a>, while Windows Phone gets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/sep/04/best-windows-phone-apps-crackle-times\">its own monthly roundup</a>. Read on for this week's iOS selection.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/a-clockwork-orange/id562227691?mt=8\">A Clockwork Orange</a></h2> <p>Publisher Random House has given Anthony Burgess' famous novel the full works for its iPad edition, with the original text, a full reading, audio clips of Burgess himself, essays and notes, the 1961 typescript, and experts analysing what it all means in videos. Plus a nifty cog-like interface to find your way around it all.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/camera+-for-ipad/id550902799?mt=8\">Camera+ for iPad</a></h2> <p>Camera+ remains a hugely popular photography app on iPhone, offering features above and beyond the native camera app's. 9m sales later, it has spawned an iPad version. Who takes photos with their iPad? Well, some people, but the real appeal here is the use of iCloud to access photos shot using the iPhone version, with a range of editing features exclusive to the iPad version. In other words, it's looking to eat iPhoto's lunch too.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/nigellissima/id556890983?mt=8\">Nigellissima</a></h2> <p>Nigella Lawson is back with another TV show and spin-off book. But this being 2012, there's also an app. Described as a \"taster\", it includes nine of the book's Italian-inspired recipes, as well as behind-the-scenes video and information on key ingredients. Oh, and Lawson's Twitter, Facebook and \"Kitchen Witter\" in the social feeds section.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fancy-nancy-ballet-school/id553383738?mt=8\">Fancy Nancy Ballet School</a></h2> <p>Fancy Nancy is the star of a popular series of HarperCollins children's books, and has already appeared in a couple of apps. This new one is less a story, and more an educational ballet app. Children can watch Nancy perform 11 moves and steps, string them together into whatever sequence they like, and then practise themselves. A video feature also allows them (or a parent) to shoot footage of their dancing, then have Nancy digitally inserted into the video.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.zeebox.com\">Zeebox</a></h2> <p>Zeebox isn't new for Brits, but it's just launched in the US, with the second-screen startup partnering with broadcasting big-hitters NBCUniversal and HBO, as well as cable provider Comcast. As in the UK, the app provides a souped-up TV guide, pulls in tweets about individual shows, and provides contextual links and information while you're watching them.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/espncricinfo-cricket-scores/id562352871?mt=8\">ESPNcricinfo</a></h2> <p>There was already an iPhone app for ESPN's cricket website, but now it's been upsized for iPad too. Expect global coverage of cricket leagues and tournaments, with news, fixtures, results, audio and video content, and ball-by-ball commentary for key matches. US cricket fans (yes, there are some) can also get video highlights of the ICC World Twenty20 tournament.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/insight-guides-world-cities/id547625883?mt=8\">Insight Guides World Cities</a></h2> <p>iOS travel-guide apps? It's a crowded market, but the new Insight Guides World Cities app is hoping to punch its weight against the guide-book giants. It's a free download, with 10 city guides available to buy in-app at \u00a33.99 a pop. They include listings of businesses, hotels and tourist hotspots, as well as a talking phrasebook and offline maps.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/kapu-tickle-toy-camera/id556527511?mt=8\">Kapu Tickle Toy Camera</a></h2> <p>If you're a parent, would you let your child loose with your iPhone or iPad's camera? What if it had dangly virtual monsters? That's the idea behind Kapu Tickle Toy Camera, a really inventive children's app that gets them playing with virtual characters, while taking snaps of them in the real world. As a child-friendly introduction to photography, it takes some beating.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/madefire/id533379666?mt=8\">Madefire</a></h2> <p>Madefire has been available on iPad for a while, but its new version is now on iPhone and iPod touch too. The idea: rather than offer digital replicas of old print comics, it commissions new ones from a host of famous artists, adding music, sound effects, motion and panoramic views to capitalise on their \"digital-first\" nature. Whizzy comics, basically, but in a good way.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nmhmc-harvey/id555722456?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">NMHMC Harvey</a></h2> <p>Albert Einstein's brain, sliced up and splashed all over your iPad screen. Now that's a marketing slogan. This, of course, is a serious app, based on the autopsy of Einstein's brain in 1955, when it was segmented into 170 parts for study by neuroscientists. That's now been digitised, so experts (and, okay, some curious amateurs) can continue to peer at Albert's spongey matter.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/disney-second-screen-personalized/id561183538?mt=8\">Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You</a></h2> <p>Or, to give it its full name: Disney Second Screen Personalized Digital Storybook: Bibbidi-Bobbidi-You. This is another second-screen app for TV viewers, but unlike Zeebox it's laser-focused on one thing: Disney's Blu-ray re-release of its classic film Cinderella. Expect \"a whole new way to experience the classic story\" (which means resisting the urge to check your tweets every five minutes). US-only for now.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/streamweaver/id550620975?mt=8\">Streamweaver</a></h2> <p>Frustratingly, this is also US-only, at least for now. It's a \"multi-angle mobile video app that's social from the moment you tap record\" according to the developers, who have also coined their own \"split-screen synchronicity\" phrase for it. The basic idea being shoot video in the same place with some friends, then see the different angles played back together. Us Brits will have to content ourselves with <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/vyclone/id521680614?mt=8\">Vyclone</a>, which is similar in ambition, but also edits the clips into a single video.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/crayola-digitools-3-d/id562292766?mt=8\">Crayola DigiTools 3-D</a></h2> <p>Crayola may be best known for its crayons, but it makes apps too \u2013&#xa0;a succession over the last year exploring digital colouring and drawing. This latest is one of a set of three (Airbrush and Effects are the other two). It's designed to be used with a physical pack of drawing accessories by children to create 3D images using backgrounds and animated stickers. The pack will be out by Christmas, but the app is available now.<br><strong>iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/history-pleasure-seeker-volume/id562529412?mt=8\">History of a Pleasure Seeker, Volume 1</a></h2> <p>This is another interesting spin on what interactive novels might look like on touchscreen devices. Based on Richard Mason's book, it blends text, an audio reading, music recordings of the pieces mentioned in the text, street scenes, note-taking facilities, and the ability to ask Mason himself questions about the contents.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dr.-frankensteins-body-lab/id558808839?mt=8\">Dr. Frankenstein's Body Lab</a></h2> <p>Book publisher DK is getting monstrous on the App Store with its new educational app, aimed at a younger audience. It teaches them about the human body's skeleton, brain and senses, heart and lungs, digestive system and muscles through drag'n'drop-based mini-game, before a final section to put those ideas into practice by, er, making a monster.

  "<p>Those of us hoping that the National Football League's lockout of its regular referees would end in a victory for the regular refs got our wish. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/27/nfl-fans-relieved-referee-lockout?intcmp=239\">The lockout, which began in June, ended with the refs in good financial shape</a>, and along the way such anti-union, Republican stalwarts as Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan came close to siding with the refs. \"It is time to get the real refs,\" Ryan told a Cincinnati town-hall audience. </p> <p>The regular refs now have an eight-year contract that will raise their average salary from $149,000 a year to $205,000 by 2019. The refs' defined pension plan (the key issue in the lockout) will remain in place for current officials through the 2016 season (or until an official earns 20 years of service), and when the NFL's defined contribution plan kicks in the annual league payment will begin at $18,000 and increase to more than $23,000 in 2019.</p> <p>The biggest downside of the agreement is that new refs will not get the defined benefit plan the veteran refs will have until 2016. A two-tier benefit system has been locked in place.</p> <p>However, if you were pulling for the regular refs, as I was, what is most worrying is why the lockout ended. The settlement did not come because fans or players threatened to boycott NFL games; nor did the settlement arise from a brilliant organizing strategy by the regular refs. The settlement came about because the replacement refs \u2013 whom nobody seemed to want to call scabs \u2013 proved to be such clowns.</p> <p>The replacement refs made Ray Anderson, the league's executive vice president for football operations, look silly when he declared: \"You've never paid for an NFL ticket to watch somebody officiate a game.\" </p> <p>The turning point in the lockout came on a nationally televised, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/25/seattle-seahawks-green-bay-packers-replacement-officials\">Monday-night game between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks</a>. On the final play of the game, a crew of replacements refs ruled a pass that Green Bay defensive back MD Jennings intercepted was a Seattle touchdown when Seattle receiver Golden Tate grabbed part of the ball after Jennings hit the ground with it.</p> <p>Fans watching the game were outraged, and soon the blown call was being shown over and over on television newscasts and sports programs around the country. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/63966/aaron-rodgers-game-is-being-tarnished\">In a Tuesday ESPN radio interview</a>, Green Bay's star quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, complained: \"The game is being tarnished by an NFL who obviously cares more about saving some money than having the integrity of the game diminished.\"</p> <p>In the normally anti-labor Wall Street Journal, Minnesota's Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton joined Rodgers in complaining about the officiating. \"We hit a new low in this week's Monday Night Football,\" Tarkenton wrote in an op-ed punningly titled <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444180004578018460285661282.html\">\"Pro Football Keeps Fumbling\"</a>.</p> <p>The larger political problem for those of us who supported regular refs is the unreliability of such turning points. Mitt Romney, with his dismissive remarks about the 47% of Americans who won't vote for him because they are government dependents, is living proof that the right in America is having trouble keeping its arrogance in check.</p> <p>Romney at least appears to be trying to back off his 47% remarks. The same cannot be said for those who run the NFL. The league's owners show no sign of believing they made a mistake in asking the refs to give up a pension plan that barely made a dent in the annual $9.3bn industry that is NFL football.</p> <p>The same clique who for years denied that repeated concussions were causing many of their players lifetime brain damage (the Alzheimer's rate among NFL players with five or more seasons is four times the national average) persist in thinking of pro football and its personnel as little more than a \"product\". </p> <p><em>Nicolaus Mills is professor of American studies at Sarah Lawrence College.

  "<h2>Homes hit by flooding</h2> <p>We received some <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/north-england-floods-homes?commentpage=\" all#start-of-comments\"\">first person accounts of the floods in northern England</a> after an unprecedented period of rain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18483208           \"><strong>55DegreesNorth</strong></a> writes: <br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nearly 1m deep in my basement this morning.

There is a feeling of being cut loose from the seats of power, wealth and concern. There has been major flooding here throughout the summer, many livelihoods are at risk in agriculture, households are facing up to considerable problems in regard to insurance and insurability and flood defences that are badly needed are not happening. But where is the analysis, who is asking the questions and who is representing the concerns of people who have to live with this insecurity?<br>The ground in North &amp; West Yorks, Humberside, Northumberland and Cumbria is saturated as we go into October and November, typically very wet months, so we can expect to see more localised flooding, more disruption and long-term damage to transport infrastructure. People in Hebden Bridge, Morpeth, North York Moors and dozens of other towns and villages live in fear of the next patch of bad weather and face the prospect of ruined homes without being able to claim for repairs.<br>The rain has now stopped, but it needs far less to tip the balance the next time. Please some decent analyses and investigation into the long-term impact and trends.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18492381\"><strong>UKJohn</strong></a> adds:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interesting how nothing is being said about the farms and how food production has been affected! We already had mayor affects on UK food production due to Summer rains, then we have the multi-year drought in the food growing areas of the U.S.A, Russia and India.<br>Over the next 6 months we can expect major food price increases, with the associated pressure on people struggling in the worldwide recession, that, by the way, the Lib-Dems at their Conference today said could last until the end of the decade. 7 years!<br>If we continue to see food production losses due to climate change, it will have a profound impact on the major industrialized countries.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18492622     \"><strong>grahama</strong></a> writes:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Living in the South East we have luckily escaped this deluge but I've heard a number of affected people on the news saying the after the last floods four years ago the government or local councils, not sure which, had made a commitment to upgrade local flood defenses and had that happened, which it hasn't, much of the damage suffered this time would not have occurred. If that is the case it would seem reasonable to me that those affected should helped by government with the additional cost of their insurance which is bound to ensue over the next few months.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Queen and Abu Hamza</h2> <p>The BBC apologised to the Queen after one of its correspondents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/25/bbc-apologises-queen-abu-hamza\">revealed a private conversation about Abu Hamza.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18474031      \"><strong>illocon</strong></a> writes:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'd classify myself as a republican, and would go so far as to say that I'm anti-monarchy ratehr than pro-republic (because god knows what eejit we'd vote in - if we even had the chance to vote directly for that person).<br>But, good on her for talking frankly about it and perhaps urging that more could be done.<br>Now, if only she could get on with getting rid of the extremists from other religions (the Church of England extremists offer too much cake) then I'd be happy</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18474055       \"><strong>Serf2ndClass</strong></a> says:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yeah, when I first heard the \"corker\" I did wonder whether Her Madge had given permission for it to go on record, I assumed she had as Frank Gardner couldn't possibly be that stupid.

I was sadly unsurprised when the sanctimonious Today programme juggernaut got into motion, and within 10 minutes had a totally embellished the story to be the lead of the hourly news bulletin.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18474263   \"><strong>SurlyRed</strong></a> suggests:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was listening to that interview, it did sound a little odd for the journalist to have raised the issue without prompting. He must have been waiting a very long time to capitalise on that bit of intelligence. But my immediate reaction was, great, now the head of the church of england is seen to have been calling for the arrest of a prominent muslim. In a crazy world where people die in protests over a poxy video, this is probably not good for the family business. I hope I'm wrong.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18474507\"><strong>OneManIsAnIsland</strong></a> isn't impressed:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh get a grip. She just wanted to know, like most of the rest of the country, why it was possible for someone to spout this hatred legally. She genuinely thought, like most other people, that some sort of crime must have been committed.<br>If the Queen asked why bankers were allowed to rake off millions while crippling the economy, would that be 'expressing concern about policy matters'? It would just be a question.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><strong><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18474546\">OneEyedSnake:</a></strong><br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm a republican, but come on - she wasn't meddling in any affairs, nor lobbying from what I've read of the conversation with Gardner.<br>Surely the question should be, why did it get to the point where the Queen felt the need to talk about a specific individual?

If the queen expressed the opinion ascribed to her, her thinking was representative of people throughout the country and beyond it.<br>Why the BBC needs to apologize is, I suppose, because one of its employees has breached a convention. It's hard to believe that this has done the slightest damage to the monarchy in the eyes of most people, however: and the idea that the head of state \"lobbies\" government is in itself an absurdity. Republicans can make their case without descending to this level of fatuity.<br>And incidentally, Frank Gardner is a fine journalist.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18474761                   \"><strong>CeilingCat</strong></a>adds:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Odd that Frank Gardner leaked this. I wouldn't have picked him as the leaking type considering his security focus and the people that he must know and talk to in doing that job. Get a rep as a leaker not good for him in helping maintain relationships with the secretive types.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18475323\"><strong>samuelbudu</strong></a> says:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Gardner should be ashamed of himself for making public what was obviously a private conversation. He has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that he cannot be trusted. How could he be a security correspondence? In any case, the Queen is also human and must have her own views on all national issues even if she is restricted by protocol to keep quiet</p> </blockquote> <h2>Future of the EU</h2> <p>Larry Elliot wrote: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/sep/28/blame-austerity-mania-breaks-euro?commentpage=2#start-of-comments\">Insistence on pain, pain and more pain means permanent recession, toppled governments and growing hostility to the EU.</a>\" Our commenters discussed the likely future of the EU, and what financial strategy should be adopted:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18534775\"><strong>John Palmer</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is obvious that a sado-masochist austerity strategy - as opposed to a genuine economic reform policy - is completely counter productive. But is is also the case that only action at a collective EU - or at least Euro-area - level to boost sustainable growth, investment and employment can really be effective in confronting this debt deleveraging crisis of finance capitalism. There are signs that the German opposition parties are starting to recognise this as does the French SP (in spite of the measures announced by the Hollande government). So do most European parties on the centre left and left. The political battle is now to convert this growing awareness of the need to change course at the European level into concrete action by the EU institutions. The Commission has begun to make some timid proposals to stimulate growth. Demands for more radical action within the European Parliament are growing. The last thing we need in Britain or elsewhere now is a relapse into deeper, utterly barren, utterly passive and utterly reactionary Euro-scepticism.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18537192\"><strong>Tache</strong></a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While many people make a convincing case that austerity won't work, it's not at all clear that its opposite (call it anti-austerity) would work either.</p> <p>Consider the analogy of a company. If it's in financial difficulties, it could adopt an austerity policy of cutting back on salaries, laying people off and stopping investment in new products. A likely outcome would be a drop in revenue due to the company becoming less competitive in the marketplace, thereby increasing the financial difficulties.</p> <p>But an anti-austerity policy would also be risky. The company could invest in new products, but that by definition would worsen the financial difficulties in the short term, because of the cash outlay. Even if the new products were to prove a success, the payback period might be too long for comfort. And of course there's no guarantee that the new products would be a success.</p> <p>Companies have gone bust both because of austerity and anti-austerity ... just something to bear in mind.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18538062\">globalvillagebard </a></strong>says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fine as far as it goes but what Elliot fails to recognise is that there just aren't any good options right now. The EU can no longer continue to act as if its primary purpose were to consume goods and service elsewhere in the world because the essential relationship between 'the west' and the rest of the world has been fundamentally altered, to the detriment of 'the west'. This has occurred at the same time as a rapidly looming resource crunch (especially in terms of fossil fuel) that cannot be separated from the environmental effects of continuing overconsumption.</p> <p>There are thus no good options and all this piece does is to point out what everybody already knows and not offer a way out of the morass.</p> <p>The basic problem is that democratic turkeys will in all likelihood continue to vote for a consumerist Christmas.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18541043\"><strong>InSpain</strong></a> adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a businessman I can confirm that there are more than sufficient young people in Spain willing to work for 7\u20ac/hr.....as they dont recieve anything from Government....just from their parents if they are lucky. So we dont need more labour reforms, we need investment in new jobs</p> <p>But if you only see that spending will fall and that tomorrow will be worse than today you are not going to invest (talking here of domestic demand) Even if you are an exporter the outlook is poor now with everyone cutting back, so exporting ourselves out of the hole looks increasingly unlikely too, But in any case Spain is not Germany as we dont have a huge manufacturing sector - Tourism and agriculture are OK and growing.....but they are not high value products (like cars) so there is not going to be a huge increase in exports....all that happens is that the service sector that provides so many jobs in Spain is disproportionately squeezed and unemployment rockets</p> <p>Lets see what happens to Germany now as they enter recession...I fear that their problems may be may times greater than they believe.....investment in production in China is falling rapidly - so less sales of German machines, and their cars look hugely expensive now - do the middle class buy luxury in depression?......certainly it seems not in clothes and food</p> </blockquote> <h2>Ed Miliband backs gay marriage equality</h2> <p>Ed Miliband has suggested Labour <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/3aymv/tw\">will back legislation for gay marriage equality. </a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18517360\"><strong>jaybwalker</strong></a> writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is precisely the right attitude that is needed on this issue- anyone, whether they want to enter into a male-female or same-sex marriage, should be able to, and religious institutions should be able to accomodate a same-sesx marriage in their place of worship if they are willing to.</p> <p>The key word is willing though- religious institutions and individual vicars, priests, rabbis, imans, etc, should not be made to conduct same-sex marriage ceremonies, as all it would do is foster resentment between the religious institution and the state.</p> <p>Frankly, I don't see why any couple, whether they be a same-sex or different-sex couple, would want to be married by someone who isn't willing to perform the ceremony, but is instead being made to- it would ruin what is supposed to be a special day for all involved, and I know I certainly wouldn't want someone performing my marriage ceremony if they didn't want to do it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thanks for all your contributions this week.</strong></p>",

  "<p><strong>\"A good decision is based on knowledge and not on numbers.\" Plato</strong></p> <p>The economic quantification of natural systems presents a significant challenge for sustainable development. Many initiatives have sought to explore and align sustainable and financial performance. Studies on the success of more sustainable companies and, latterly, investigations into the economic value of ecosystems and ecosystem services through <a href=\"http://www.wavespartnership.org/waves/natural-capital-accounting\" title=\"\">natural capital accounting</a> have been the focus of much effort and seek to place ecosystem value alongside financial value. The logic is this: once we know a thing's price, we can value it properly. The logic is sound, up to a point.</p> <p><strong>My dog is 33.2541% overweight \u2026 </strong></p> <p>Putting a price on ecosystems is like trying to find out exactly how overweight your dog is before you decide what to do about it. If the canine is too fat, it is obvious that a diet is required. Knowing precisely how overweight Rover is won't tell you anything you don't already know; it just puts a figure on it.</p> <p>Equally, we don't need to know in dollars, pounds or renminbi how valuable natural capital and natural productivity is in order to tell us that we should behave more sustainably. We should already know that because of the manifest global impacts produced by our current industrial and economic models.</p> <p>As attractive and possibly useful as highlighting the economic value on ecosystems might be, challenges remain. The most significant of which is the problem of price and how it is derived. Price mechanisms used by financial markets simply don't have to recognise the sustainability or otherwise of an asset. Ecosystem valuation will not change that; it is the price mechanism itself which needs to change.</p> <p>We know the natural environment is the source of all financial value. Put crassly, the value of natural capital in financial terms is the sum of any financial activity in the world that there has ever been and ever will be.</p> <p>There is no money without human beings capable of inventing and using it. There are no human beings without food, air and water.</p> <p><strong>Price versus value</strong></p> <p>So the real challenge is not the price of natural capital but its value, now and in the future. Financial markets need tools suitable for the job of valuing natural production and ecosystem health as assets capable of long-term value generation. They should evolve methods of compounding rather than discounting future value and develop the ability to value the private worth of common assets and goods. Without such financial innovation, natural value will fail to meet the challenge of economic price.</p> <p>As Warren Buffett said; \"Price is what you pay; value is what you get.\"</p> <p><em>Joss Tantram is partner responsible for corporate sustainability at </em><a href=\"http://www.terrafiniti.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Terrafiniti LLP</em></a><em>.

Gridlock at this scale is only set to increase as the number of cars on the road is set quadruple to four billion by 2050. So what are the solutions? How do urban infrastructure, the energy grid and technology need to connect to deliver more sustainable transport solutions? How will patterns of behaviour around mobility shift in the context of urbanisation? </p> <p>On Wednesday <strong>14 November</strong> Guardian Sustainable Business and Ford will convene a panel of experts to discuss the future of mobility. The discussion will be streamed live on this page and we'd like you to get involved. </p> <p>The discussion will be chaired by Jo Confino, an executive editor of the Guardian. He will be joined by:</p> <h2>Sylvain Haon, secretary general, <a href=\"http://www.polis-online.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polis Network</a></h2> <p>Sylvain joined Polis in 2003 after several years of experience in transport and European affairs. He was appointed executive director in 2006, and has the overall responsibility of managing the Polis secretariat and implementing the Polis strategy. Before becoming executive director, Sylvain coordinated the PILOT project on sustainable urban transport plans. Sylvain is co-leader of the urban mobility working group of the European Road Transport Research Advisory Council (ERTRAC).</p> <h2>Susan Claris, associate director, <a href=\"http://www.arup.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arup</a></h2> <p>While Susan's career in Arup has focused on transport planning, she has also worked on urban research activities for the firm. Susan was project manager for \"UrbanLife\" workshops held in six cities over two years. She was the researcher on Urban Mobility for the World Economic Forum's SlimCity initiative which resulted in a set of knowledge cards to share good practice, targeted at city mayors and CEOs. Susan was also the researcher on urbanisation for Arup's Drivers of Change programme with the work undertaken as the world's population became 50% urban for the first time. </p> <h2>Barb Samardzich, vice president, product development, Ford of Europe</h2> <p>Barb has held several key leadership roles at Ford. She served as vice president, Powertrain Engineering, responsible for engine and transmission engineering worldwide.&#xa0; Before that, she was vice president, Powertrain Operations.&#xa0; During her time as executive director, Small FWD and RWD Vehicles, she was responsible for the design, engineering and development of nine key Ford, Mercury and Lincoln vehicles, including the 2005 MY Mustang.</p> <h2>Fabio Orecchini, professor of energy systems, University of Rome</h2> <p>Fabio is coordinator of the energy and mobility systems section of CIRPS - the Interuniversity Research Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Rome. He is also scientific coordinator for national and international research projects and director of the Department of Energy and Mechanics at the Guglielmo Marconi University.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The interviewer said he was shocked that a French diplomat would criticise his homeland so publicly, but the French consul in London Edouard Braine stuck his ground. Britain was between 35 and 50 years ahead of France in its attitude and acceptance of people with a disability, he told the French radio station.</p> <p>Braine has been tetraplegic since horse-riding accident in 2002. He uses a wheelchair and can only move the thumb and index finger on his left hand.</p> <p>Braine leaves his post in London this weekend to return to Paris, where, he lamented, he will find it much more difficult, if not impossible, to get around by public transport.</p> <p>But the diplomat will return to a country where disability is high on the political and cultural agenda.</p> <p>This year three landmark films have been released: the record-breaking and highly acclaimed Intouchables (Untouchables) \u2013 the story of a wheelchair-using aristocrat and his ex-convict carer from the grim city suburbs; De Rouille et D'Os, in which Marion Cotillard plays a killer whale trainer who has her legs amputated after an accident; and Hasta La Vista, a \"comedy\" about three young men \u2013 one blind, one a wheelchair user and a third who is completely paralysed \u2013 on a trip to Spain to lose their virginity.</p> <p>So far, so fiction, but back in the real-world, the French government issued a directive to all ministries earlier this month insisting that any new laws must take into account their impact on those with disabilities.</p> <p>It was a beefing up the 2005 equality law introduced during the Chirac administration and described by those in organisations working with people with disabilities as the \"turned corner\".</p> <p>Emmanuelle Dal'Secco of the organisation Handicap.fr admitted the situation was improving for France's five million people with disabilities but only slowly.</p> <p>\"We cannot deny that things are going forward, and the Paralympic Games in London were a great boost, even if we had to fight tooth and nail for a few minutes live coverage on TV,\" she said. \"The problem is that moving forward costs money.\"</p> <p>Dal'Secco pointed out that the 2005 law gave a 2015 deadline for all public buildings to be made accessible to anyone with any disability, a costly measure at a time of economic austerity.</p> <p>\"We're just two years from that date and at the last count only around 15% of buildings are accessible, so it's hard to see that happening. Now, with the current economic problems, people are saying it's not feasible and are making excuses.\"</p> <p>Nicolas Bissardon, 30, a campaigner who was born with no arms and with his hands at shoulder level, said there had been \"enormous progress\" in France since 2005.</p> <p>\"In a global sense France has taken big steps forward in the last seven years. The country is better, more open and more mature in its approach to disability. Before it was a badly known, badly addressed issue, but today there is in general more acceptance, more integration and more opportunities,\" he said.</p> <p>Bissardon, also of Handicap.fr, based in Lyon, is the driving force behind a film festival called Dans La Bo\u00eete, aimed at employers. He said: \"I started work before 2005 and I have worked since and I can see the difference. After the 2005 law, which was a corner turned for the handicapped, I suddenly saw what was possible.</p> <p>\"Today companies make more effort to recruit handicapped people, schools are more competent to welcome disabled children and their approach is much more modern, and handicapped people feel more protected. Attitudes have also changed.\"</p> <p>Dal'Secco said films such as the Intouchables raise awareness, but she was sceptical of their ability to provoke long-term change in attitudes.</p> <p>\"It's complicated; 20 million people went to see the film in France and without doubt it will have had an impact on the way they see disability, but I'm not sure if it will have really changed their view.</p> <p>\"If it has an impact it will be minor, and once people leave the cinema.\"</p> <p>But Bissardon said: \"Intouchables was more a film about an unemployed guy from the <em>banlieue</em> [outskirts] than about someone who has a disability.</p> <p>\"What it does show is that attitudes have changed because before people didn't want to know about [those with a disability], they didn't want to see it, it was hidden.\"</p>",
  "<p>In America, the biggest documentary of the year \u2013 and, according to Box Office Mojo, the second-biggest political documentary of all time \u2013 is a film called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149070/2016\" title=\"\">2016: Obama's America</a>. Based on conservative scholar <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/dinesh-dsouza\" title=\"\">Dinesh D'Souza</a>'s 2010 book The Roots of Obama's Rage, the film tries to put forward the notion that Barack Obama is actively attempting to diminish America's global influence.</p> <p>In little over a month, 2016: Obama's America has gone on to gross $32m (\u00a319.8m). Even Rupert Murdoch has urged that his Twitter followers should watch it. Whether or not the film will have any pull in November's presidential election is another matter \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/100742\" title=\"\">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> famously didn't in 2004, and that made more than $200m worldwide \u2013 but its success has been enough to get the Washington Post thinking. This week the Post published <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/26/will-anti-obama-2016-spawn-more-of-the-right-stuff/\" title=\"\">an article predicting that 2016: Obama's America will inspire a surge of similarly-minded conservative movies</a>.</p> <p>The article points to films such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146337/act-of-valour\" title=\"\">Act of Valour</a> \u2013 the weird little action film starring real-life soldiers from earlier this year \u2013 for proof, alongside the anti-Occupy message of The Dark Knight Rises, the anti-teachers' union message of forthcoming drama Won't Back Down and the remake of Red Dawn which is, well, a remake of Red Dawn. And it may be right. Obama's America really might kickstart a resurgence of rightwing films. All those people who like to grumble about the liberal media could be inundated by a deluge of movies catering specifically to them. However, the trouble is that none of these films are likely to be very good.</p> <p>For whatever reason, the further right a film leans, the worse it objectively gets. It's almost as if, by ramming their message home as fiercely as possible, conservative film-makers forget how to tell stories properly. Act of Valour was as much let down by its one-dimensional \"Join the army!\" message as its numerous stilted performances, and that was ostensibly politically neutral. Another example would be 2008's notorious <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnHllNDcv4A\" title=\"\">An American Carol</a> \u2013 a conservative retelling of A Christmas Carol where a hapless Michael Moore analogue learns that unless he renounces his silly liberal ways, America will end up being destroyed by al-Qaida. It's a comedy \u2013 and even directed by Airplane's David Zucker \u2013 and yet its cold, pro-war message kills all trace of humour dead on sight.</p> <p>And then there's the Atlas Shrugged series, the second instalment of which <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF9QT43uDQU\" title=\"\">is due for American release next month</a>. If the first part was any indication, audiences look set to be in for another bone-crushingly tedious romp through Ayn Rand's ingrained hatred of kindness, presented with all the flair of a regional corporate video: or any movie from the faith-based Provident films, like last year's hamfisted sub-Nicholas Sparks anti-abortion drama <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_9l7lEe-AA\" title=\"\">October Baby</a>, which unilaterally sacrificed narrative and quality in favour of heavy-handed moralising.</p> <p>None of these films are really worth watching, and the thought that 2016: Obama's America will inspire more of them to be made is enough to make your heart sink. Of course, there's a chance that not every conservative film ever made will stink \u2013 The Incredibles didn't, and at least most of the Rambo sequels were full of enough flatly amoral violence to render them hilarious \u2013 but the idea that we're about to be clonked over the head with hundreds of lay-it-on-thick, preach-to-the-converted An American Carol variations is almost too much to bear. If the Washington Post is right, and we really are in for a new wave of rightwing film-making, we'd all better brace ourselves for some pretty crappy movies.</p>",
  "<p>The Vatican's daily newspaper has denounced as a \"clumsy fake\" an alleged 4th-century Coptic papyrus that suggests Jesus was a married man.</p> <p>Karen King, a professor at Harvard divinity school, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/papyrus-jesus-wife-academic-debate?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">presented the ancient text</a> at a conference in Rome last week, claiming it contained the words \"Jesus said to them, 'my wife'\", a possible reference to Mary Magdalene.</p> <p>Christian tradition maintains that Jesus did not marry, a theory that underpins the Catholic church's insistence that priests remain single and celibate. The idea that Jesus did have children was most recently aired in Dan Brown's bestseller The Da Vinci Code.</p> <p>The Vatican made no comment in the days following King's announcement, but L'Osservatore Romano published a strongly worded editorial on Thursday claiming that the papyrus was a \"clumsy fake, like many others from the near east\", which had probably been concocted for sale.</p> <p>The paper's editor, Giovanni Maria Vian, added that the story neatly catered \"to a contemporary ideology which has nothing to do with ancient Christian history, or with the figure of Jesus. Either way, in any case, it's fake.\"</p> <p>The fragment of text belongs to a private collector who asked King to help translate it. King said the document, which was reportedly translated from an earlier Greek text, originated in Egypt but gave no further details. Experts are split over its authenticity, with some doubting the grammar used in the text.</p> <p>In an article alongside the Osservatore Romano editorial, leading Coptic scholar Alberto Camplani, who helped organise the conference, warned that the papyrus could be a modern fake and criticised King's decision to take her findings to the media before more studies were carried out.</p> <p>Vian was also critical of King's PR acumen. The announcement was \"prepared without leaving anything to chance\", he wrote. \"American papers were alerted in advance, a prearranged press conference held by Karen L King to prepare a global scoop, which was however immediately put in doubt by specialists.\"</p> <p>Harvard has said it is awaiting testing of the text's ink before publishing King's findings in the Harvard Theological Review.</p>",
  "<p>I had heard whispers of the existence of international projects in primary schools during various CPD courses and also of the numerous benefits to the pupils, staff and school that they provide. Not wanting to miss out on an opportunity for the pupils and myself to learn from others in different cultures I set about exploring the labyrinths of possibility to make it happen.</p> <p>An international project is an excellent way to educate both pupils and staff in a holistic manner. I can't recommend it highly enough. I have participated in the <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/comenius.htm\">Comenius</a> project which involves seven partner countries from all over Europe: Wales, Sweden, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Lithuania and Denmark. For our project, an environmental science and <a href=\"http://www.ngfl-cymru.org.uk/esdgc.htm\">ESDGC</a> (Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship) theme was agreed which would allow each of the partner countries to share their own specific experiences and understandings. Staff and pupil mobilities would be integral as well as a central shared curriculum for the pupils.</p> <p>The first challenge I faced when setting up the project was finding suitable schools with students of as similar age in variety of European countries whose aims, objective and time scales matched ours. This is no easy task as you must be sure that the schools that you are working with are committed, reliable and suitable. In order to make these links I created a school profile using the <a href=\"http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\">eTwinning website</a> - a web-based platform that allows you to search, browse and connect with other international schools. When building your international schools group be prepared for ups and downs. Sometimes you'll think you're onto a winner, then they'll disappear off the radar. Conversely, you may occasionally be blessed by lady luck, and have one of your contacts introduce you to partners that they have found that fits your search profile providing you with a quick win.</p> <p>Once your group is complete, the next stage is to officially apply to the British Council's Comenius project. There are loads of different connotations and permutations available so make sure you go with the one that suits your school's needs and expectations. We went for a multilateral schools partnership allowing staff and pupil mobilities, which provided the school with \u20ac20,000 for the two year project.</p> <p>The completion and verification of the form itself is a mighty challenge as it is a dynamic PDF document that needs to be circulated and updated within the group and activated then verified. This is the most technical and frustrating part of the process and it is always wise to start this as early as possible before the cut-off dates, as there are sure to be hiccups along the way. If you have an advisory body or someone who has done this before available to guide you then seek them out \u2013 I didn't have this option, so had to graft it out a little, but I feel more informed as a result. During this application process you will also, as a group, have to agree upon the dates and details of your course content, such as the shared activities and the mobilities of staff and pupils.</p> <p>When your group and project has been ratified you will need to be ready to set up the transfer of funds. I would advise you to start this preparatory process swiftly to avoid any delay in funding. Contact your LEA finance section and ask for advice first, there may be systems in place to assist you. You may need to set up a separate school bank account that accepts European transfers in Euros. Also, due to auditing requirements, most purchases such as flights, accommodation, expenses on trips and currency exchange will have to be carried out by teachers with good will in advance and receipts handed in and money returned later. A big tip of mine is that you get people with financial expertise to deal with the issues and conundrums as they arise, our systems do not appear to be easily adaptable to embrace such projects just yet so patience is required. I would also advise caution when managing the budget, the cost of mobilities and supply cover soon adds up so supplementary or charitable funding may be required at some point.</p> <p>The benefits of the project were vast. There are many academic but even more social and experiential positives. Students and staff gained insights and an understanding of new cultures, learned how to communicate and learn from and with others who didn't have English as their first language. It makes people reflect on their own approach and practices and removes the lid that can confine enthusiastic educators. A collaborative work ethic is inherent in projects of this nature and the pupils and staff involved develop a greater confidence and freedom of spirit that breaks down the insular barriers that the systemic hubris of our system has progressively erected. You'll need to be resilient, enthusiastic and dedicated to get your project going, but take it from me, it is worth every second of endeavour.</p> <p>Activities that were undertaken by the pupils as part of their shared curriculum included creating and sending recycled material Christmas decoration and Christmas cards. International project Christmas trees were then decorated and were displayed for all to see. The biodiversity for the various countries was studied and posters were made from information and photos sent by the different partner countries. Letters and emails were exchanged as well as presentations about the various countries and school settings. An international herb garden was developed when each country exchanged a packet of seeds from a native herb.</p> <p>The teacher mobilities were fantastic. Being able to see how other countries approach teaching is absolutely fascinating. It allowed me to step outside of the box and see that there are many perfectly valid approaches to educating, not just one linear, prescriptive method. By going abroad and observing other teachers in their own environment you develop not just professionally but also as a person. Setting up an international project and experiencing all that they have to offer will also make you a more attractive candidate for further teaching and management roles. By successfully applying, organising and running the course you demonstrate a great number of skills. Additionally, the knowledge and understanding that you glean from your trips will have shaped your practice in a way that nothing else can.</p> <p><em>Adam Lopez teaches at <a href=\"https://www.pgfl.org.uk/schools/tf/Tavernspite/default.aspx\">Tavernspite CP Primary School</a> in Pembrokeshire<br>and, until this summer, taught at <a href=\"http://www.steplearn.net/langstone/\">Langstone Primary School</a>, Newport, South Wales.

  "<p>Three decades of European Commission-funded best practice projects and billions of euros later, Britain has a problem. We know that there are many excellent examples of urban and rural public transport, cycling, car sharing, air quality strategies, freight and logistic strategies and other successes that improve quality of life for local residents in Denmark, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. But we do not imitate, adapt and develop the best practice examples at home.</p> <p>There is no learning process underway for local authorities that interrogates this best practice and adopts the best ideas. On a recent trip to Germany, I checked into my hotel in Wuppertal and was given a free public transport pass. If you visit a tourist destination in the Black Forest in southern Germany and stay in a hotel or holiday let, you will be given the same kind of card. This encourages tourists to leave their cars at home, helping cut congestion and pollution. This does not happen even in the busiest UK tourist destinations, such as the Lake District. After several decades of worry, reports and debates about sustainable transport in the Lake District, a helpful policy modelled on the Black Forest case has still yet to be put into practice. Many parts of the region are blighted by the volume of cars, carparks, noise and pollution.</p> <p>This is not just a transport matter. A report from ITDP in New York, published last year, presents an <a href=\"http://www.itdp.org/library/publications/europes-vibrant-new-low-carbon-communities-desktop-printer-version/\" title=\"\">analysis of eight communities</a> that have adopted \"smart urban growth\" policies that encourage walking, cycling and public transport, high-quality housing, bringing derelict sites back into use and creating high-quality living space with less pollution, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a positive impact on public health.</p> <p>Given the emphasis in British political, economic and planning debates on the need for new homes, the need to defend the green belt and the very large amount of brownfield land available for development, it is surprising that Greenwich is the only British community in this study.</p> <p>There is nothing on the scale of Freiburg, with its 15,500 residents in high quality car-free areas, Hammarby Sjostad and its 17,000 population and Vastra Hammen and with a community of 4,300. There is ample scope in the UK for dozens of areas like this \u2013 but it is not happening.</p> <p>Why does the UK have such a large implementation deficit? There are a number of possible explanations. The UK has moved in the direction of the US and expects markets to sort things out, at the same time as we experience repeated examples of market failure.</p> <p>Markets have not sorted out banking and finance and markets do not work well in organising and delivering high-quality, totally integrated public transport systems. Similarly, markets don't seem ready and willing to sort out smart urban growth, re-use of brownfield sites and housing that can match <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/feb/09/passivhaus-technology-housing-associations-climate-change?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">German Passivhaus standards</a> of energy use.</p> <p>Relying on markets is partnered by a reduction in the power and funding for local government to take action that would improve quality of life. A close look at Malmo (population 302,000) or Gothenburg (population 522,000) show how local authorities in Sweden have more powers and budgets to make change happen at local level without going cap in hand to the centre.</p> <p>The small Swedish city of Lund (population 82,000) has implemented a world-class transport, land use, housing and economic development strategy that can only be dreamed about in similar UK cities. When local authorities get more power and more money to make things happen, they attract politicians with a stronger determination to produce real change.</p> <p><em>John Whitelegg is a member of the </em><a href=\"http://www.sei-international.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Stockholm Environment Institute</em></a><em>, visiting professor of sustainable transport at Liverpool John Moores University.

Their size and shape point to a river somewhere between ankle and waist deep that flowed through the landscape at a speedy metre a second.</p> <p>The $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) trundling science lab began its mission on Mars after a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/aug/06/curiosity-rover-mars-landing-live-blog\" title=\"\">dramatic arrival last month</a> in which the rover was winched to the surface from a spacecraft hovering overhead on rocket thrusters.</p> <p>Powered by radioactive plutonium and lithium-ion batteries, the rover will spend one Martian year, or 687 Earth days, exploring the Gale crater and its central mountain. For much of the mission, the rover will sample rocks on the gentle flanks of Mount Sharp, following a path worked out from pictures snapped by orbiters overhead.</p> <p>Curiosity is searching not for signs of life past or present, but for evidence that Mars was once habitable. Scores of earlier missions have found evidence for water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have beamed back images of ancient lakes and gullies, though none that still flows today. The north and south poles are largely frozen water.</p> <p>The latest pictures are the first to show stones and gravel that have been dragged along the Martian surface by a river in the planet's distance past. Nasa geologists said the rounder shape of some of the pebbles suggested they had travelled long distances from above the crater rim.</p> <p>The rover took the images with a telephoto camera on its central mast, downhill from a pattern of sediments called an alluvial fan created by several water streams perhaps billions of years ago. The stones vary from angular to smooth and range from golf ball-sized to grains of sand.</p> <p>\"The shapes tell you they were transported and the sizes tell you they couldn't be transported by wind. They were transported by water flow,\" said Rebecca Williams, who works on the Curiosity mission at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona.</p> <p>The rover's prime destination is the slope of Mount Sharp where regions rich in clays and sulphates have been mapped from orbit. These minerals can preserve organic material that is thought to be crucial for life to thrive.</p> <p>\"We have gravels of different sizes cemented into rock and at some points we can see they are weathered out and&#xa0;rounded, and that tells us this was a stream bed with violently flowing water,\" said Susanne&#xa0;Schwenzer, a postdoctoral researcher at Open University. \"It's the first time we've really had this from Mars. This is basically the same as we would see in a terrestrial flow, with violently flowing and transporting these gravels,\" &#xa0;There is not enough information yet to date the ancient riverbed, she added.</p> <p>Some of the earliest evidence for water on Mars was beamed back to Earth from Nasa's Mariner 9 orbiter in the 1970s. The probe arrived amid a spectacular month-long storm that obscured the whole planet. But as the dust settled, the spacecraft's cameras looked down on a landscape carved by ancient river systems.</p> <p>More recent evidence for water on Mars came from Nasa's Phoenix lander which explored the geology and chemistry of the planet's Arctic region. Instruments onboard the lander scanned clouds that formed several kilometres high in the Martian sky and even noticed a gentle fall of snow.</p> <p>As Curiosity climbs Mount Sharp the layers of rock it encounters will become younger and younger, from perhaps 3.5bn years old at the base, to modern times at the summit. Through analysing rocks along the way, the rover can build up a picture of the planet's geological history, and when water that may have sustained life was there.</p> <p>\"A long-flowing stream can be a habitable environment. It is not our top choice as an environment for preservation of organics, though,\" said John Grotzinger, a project scientist and geologist on the mission at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"We're still going to Mount Sharp, but this is insurance that we have already found our first potentially habitable environment.\"</p>",
  "<p>Whether he knows it or not, Lewis Hamilton has taken a step into history. His move to Mercedes-Benz will disappoint those who enjoyed the sight of a British driver in a British team, but he is following in some big wheeltracks.</p> <p>Some will question his motives, accusing him deserting the team that nurtured him from the age of 13 in order to benefit from a deal offering him greater control of his image rights but no guarantee of a race-winning car. From another point of view, however, his decision is potentially a stimulating one for the sport and its fans.</p> <p>Next to Ferrari, Mercedes is the most potent name in motor sport \u2013 and it goes back a lot further in the story of motor racing. A car bearing the three-pointed star won the last grand prix to be held before the first world war in 1914. British drivers have a special connection with the team and Hamilton's arrival will link him to a thread begun before the second world war by Richard Seaman and continued in the 1950s by Stirling Moss.</p> <p>In 1937, at the height of the Silver Arrows' dominance of European racing, Mercedes's management recruited Seaman, then the young star of British motor racing. The 24-year-old's decision was criticised in some quarters, not least by his mother, who did not want him to join a team then subsidised by the National Socialist government, but his victory at the N\u00fcrburgring the following year, when he beat the team's German drivers in their home race, was as significant a step for British motor racing as Bradley Wiggins's Tour de France victory this year was for British cycling.</p> <p>Educated at Rugby, Cambridge and the Brooklands track, Seaman was the very model of the debonair pre-war racing driver. In 1939, however, he was killed when his car hit a tree and caught fire during the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa. He had been leading the race when the accident occurred.</p> <p>Sixteen years later the team recruited Moss to race alongside Juan Manuel Fangio, the reigning world champion, in a team whose dominance was reflected in their ability to fill all the places on the podium. Vastly impressed by the team's unmatched attention to detail, Moss followed in the great Argentinian's tracks for much of the 1955 season but on a memorable afternoon at Aintree he became the first home driver to win the British Grand Prix, with Fangio a short head behind. In one of the legendary drives of motor racing history, Moss also won the classic Mille Miglia in a Mercedes sports car.</p> <p>The tragedy at Le Mans that year, when 82 people were killed after one of the team's cars ploughed into the crowd, prompted Mercedes to withdraw at the end of the season. Their gradual return to Formula One began in the early 1990s, when they began to supply engines to various teams \u2013 including McLaren.</p> <p>Two years ago they bought the Brawn team and renamed it, giving Michael Schumacher the opportunity to make his comeback. Although their performances to date have yet to live up to their past achievements, a top\u2011quality technical team based at Brackley in Northamptonshire and led by Ross Brawn should be capable of providing Hamilton with the equipment he needs.</p> <p>It should not be forgotten that Hamilton is not exactly stepping into unknown territory. Every one of his 20 grand prix victories has been achieved with a Mercedes engine in his car. He knows the company and is well aware of the quality of their engineering. He and his manager, Simon Fuller, will also have been influenced by the power of their marketing department to enhance his image around the world.</p> <p>Like every major manufacturer venturing into motor sport, Mercedes is subject to the fluctuations of the marketplace. A bad couple of years for worldwide sales of its saloons and 4x4s could prompt a reassessment of its involvement. But Hamilton must has been given reassurance, at the very highest level, of its commitment over the foreseeable future.</p> <p>As far as the sport's box-office appeal is concerned, a shake-up is seldom a bad thing. Hamilton gets the chance to step out of a comfortable environment and test himself in a different setting. Mercedes have a driver who will pressure them to deliver the goods.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McLaren are recruiting the bright young talent of Sergio P\u00e9rez to set alongside the experience of Jenson Button. Bernie Ecclestone will not be alone in rubbing his hands with glee at the thought of the interest that will be generated by the reshuffle at the first race of 2013.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's double dip recession is over, according to economists who say official figures on Friday from the services sector show the economy rebounded during the second half of the summer.</p> <p>But they warn that the economy is likely to continue its stumbling path in the runup to Christmas and into the new year following a string of surveys that showing the UK's major trading partners struggling against strong economic headwinds.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said its monthly index of services revealed output from the sector growing by 1.1% in July. The jump in activity is expected to offset a further decline in construction output and a manufacturing industry hit by lower levels of exports when figures for third quarter GDP are published on 25 October.</p> <p>A positive GDP figure for the third quarter will put an end to nine months of recession that have undermined confidence in the government's handling of the economy.</p> <p>George Osborne has come under intense pressure to drop austerity measures in favour of a stimulus package to revive growth.</p> <p>The chancellor has argued that the economy will pick up when confidence returns, which can only happen when the government has shown it can successfully implement policies to cut the public sector deficit.</p> <p>The ONS figures show the Treasury has adopted a looser fiscal policy in 2012, which could lead his critics to accuse him of switching to a Plan B by stealth. Government and other services provided one of the biggest boosts to the expansion of services output in July alongside the banking and hospitality sectors.</p> <p>However, just as it was difficult to judge the health of the economy in June after activity levels were hit by a public holiday moving from May into June, it is equally difficult through the summer months taking into account the impact of the Olympics.</p> <p>The Bank of England and most major economic forecasting organisations have said the economy's ups and downs should be discounted in favour of analysis that says the UK has spent the last two years treading water.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data provider Markit, said strong output from the services sector and industrial production put the UK back on course for growth, albeit at a low level.</p> <p>He said: \"Looking at the available data so far, GDP therefore looks likely to have risen in the third quarter, bringing an end to the UK's double-dip recession. However, it remains too early to tell whether the upturn will prove temporary or not. Certainly given the ongoing cuts to public spending, the dark cloud of uncertainty that hangs over business investment due to the eurozone crisis and the fragility of global economic growth, it seems likely that the underlying pace of growth will be modest at best.\"</p> <p>The services sector, which accounts for 77% of the economy, has come under severe pressure over the last year as the full impact of high inflation and low wage rises have taken their toll on spending by businesses and consumers. The decline in inflation from more than 5% to 2.4% is expected to encourage a rise in consumption, though economists think low wage rises will keep spending subdued.</p>",
  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">melting sea ice</a>, extreme weather and continued warnings from leading scientists on the need to tackle climate change, it beggars belief that the coalition government persists in pushing though policies that will increase the nation's reliance on dirty and increasingly expensive fossil fuels.</p> <p>But with the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/annual_conference_2012\" title=\"\">Labour party conference</a> starting on Sunday, it's also time to ask; why isn't the opposition doing more to champion the environment?</p> <p>Last week Ed Miliband \u2013 a man who really understands the issues - <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5j8Z5M4Jl4E7CHFB-N-SodVgaXnrw?docId=N0312291348225380480A\" title=\"\">made a timely and extremely welcome intervention on the debate</a>. He gave his backing to the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">government's official climate adviser</a> and said that the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">energy bill</a> must contain a clear commitment to decarbonise the UK power system by 2030.</p> <p>This is a crucial contribution that challenges government policy - championed by the chancellor, George Osborne - for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/28/gas-fired-power-stations-uk\" title=\"\">a new dash for gas</a> that would leave the UK hooked on this costly fossil fuel for decades. It will also increase pressure on the Liberal Democrats, and help solidify <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-green-promises\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg's resolve to hold the Conservatives to their promises on the environment</a>.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">David Cameron's pledge to lead the greenest government ever</a>, the past two-and-a-half years have seen environmental policies shunted into the margins of policy-making.</p> <p>The coalition would find it harder to disregard the environment and the need to build a strong low-carbon economy if Labour put the issue high on the political agenda. During the last parliament, Cameron's support for the Climate Change Act was pivotal in persuading the then Labour government to put their weight behind it. If we really are going to build the low-carbon future that we so urgently need, it's time for Labour to step up to the plate.</p> <p>For Labour, championing the environment is a real opportunity to drive an electoral juggernaut into the political space left by a right-lurching Conservative party and a Liberal Democrat party so far failing to hold the line on environmental action.</p> <p>Yet Labour's Treasury team has woefully failed to challenge Osborne's flawed economic strategy. As the chancellor has steadily undermined the green economy and shown increasing support for gas and oil, the silence from Ed Balls has frequently been deafening.</p> <p>Where has the shadow chancellor been when Osborne has pushed for policies that prop up the discredited broken carbon-dependent economy of the last century and undermine investment in a cleaner future?</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2012/07/green-or-growth-is-a-false-choice-%E2%80%93-cbi-chief/\" title=\"\">the CBI calculated</a> that the green economy provided one-third of all growth in 2010, and estimated that it could add 0.5% to growth in 2012 if only the government \"put the right policies in place\". With the Bank of England forecasting zero growth this year, 0.5% is not to be sniffed at.</p> <p>But that potential 0.5% is also a better type of growth \u2013 one that provides firm foundations for future prosperity. Investing in wind, waves and sun, and energy saving would create tens of thousands of new jobs and business opportunities right across the country, not just in a few favoured locations. And weaning the nation off expensive gas and reducing energy demand will help cash-strapped households struggling with rocketing fuel bills - unlike just making it easier for them to build conservatories.</p> <p>Balls would find an easy win if he used his despatch box attacks to really get Osborne on the ropes over the misleading economy versus environment narrative \u2013 and his failure to support a green economy that's currently growing in its own right at over four per cent each year. Surely, the green economy is an extraordinary political opportunity for Labour?</p> <p>But, rather astonishingly the CBI appears to be more outspoken on the need for green growth than the shadow chancellor.</p> <p>Earlier this year CBI boss <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">John Cridland attacked the lack of government support for the growing green economy</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"The UK has made a great start tapping into green economic opportunities but mixed signals from the government are setting the UK back. If we can't be sure that the policies of today will still be the policies of tomorrow, we simply won't build business and consumer confidence or secure the investment we need.\" </blockquote> <p>We will never capitalise on the promise of our burgeoning green economy or avert the worst excesses on climate change, unless politicians are prepared to stand up and be counted both in opposition and in government.</p> <p>Tackling climate change isn't a luxury, it's a necessity \u2013 and with the key levers of government power in the hands of a proudly anti-green chancellor we desperately need Labour to be the greenest opposition ever.</p>",
  "<p>For four decades the economist Sir Andrew Crockett, who has died aged 69 after suffering from pancreatic cancer, sought to improve the interaction between the real economy and the financial system. A public servant working through international institutions, he made major contributions to policy analysis, to understanding global economic challenges and to harnessing co-operation in the cause of stability.</p> <p>In 1972, Andrew went to the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/index.htm\" title=\"International Monetary Fund\">International Monetary Fund</a> in Washington as PA to its managing director, Johannes Witteveen (as Andrew's successor, I got to know him well). The following year, the oil-exporting countries of Opec increased their prices to such an extent that while they were amassing surpluses, the economies of Europe and North America \u2013 their principal customers \u2013 were severely threatened. Andrew helped devise the innovative recycling of petrodollars back to the countries in deficit to help maintain global activity. When, later in his 17-year stay, he became involved in research, he transformed the IMF's World Economic Outlook report into a compelling expression of the organisation's policy message.</p> <p>After four years as an executive director of the Bank of England, he went to Basel as general manager of the Bank for International Settlements (1994-2003) \u2013 the central bankers' bank. At a time when its role and influence were in question, he extended its reach from its European roots to embrace the emerging economies, consolidated its hosting of key international regulatory committees and encouraged its development of macroprudential analysis, evaluating the vulnerability to risk of the whole financial system, long before it became fashionable.</p> <p>His most lasting contribution came through the creation in 1999 of the Financial Stability Forum, enlarged in 2009 into the <a href=\"http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/\" title=\"Financial Stability Board\">Financial Stability Board</a>. This was born out of his awareness that finance ministers, supervisors and central banks held their own policy discussions in separate silos, largely ignorant of the thinking going on in other parts of the system. This resulted not only in incomplete and potentially flawed analysis, but also in the absence of follow-up and implementation, whether by the international standard-setters or by national governments, of the policy measures shown to be necessary by analysis. As its first chair (1999-2003), Andrew embedded collaborative ways of working that proved indispensable in the financial crisis later in the decade, and are now at the core of international decision-making.</p> <p>Born in Glasgow, and possessed of typically Scottish qualities of modesty, integrity and a capacity for prudent stewardship, Andrew gained degrees at Queens' College, Cambridge and Yale. In his first post, at the Bank of England (1966-72), he was a junior but key member of the team that brought about fundamental changes in the conduct of monetary policy, notably through the competition and credit control reforms of 1971. As the Bank's international director, following his return from the US, he was heavily engaged in helping craft the European exchange-rate infrastructure that culminated in the Maastricht treaty (1992). Irrespective of the political climate, and as for much of the rest of his career, he aimed to provide impartial, pragmatic advice on what would work and what would not.</p> <p>His name was mentioned both in relation to the managing directorship of the IMF and the governorship of the Bank of England, but both roles eluded him. His appointment to either job might have made a difference in the last decade, given his knowledge of the links between financial imbalances, the real economy and financial crises. From 2003, the year he was knighted, he was president of JP Morgan International, acting as an ambassador for the bank and interpreting the official and commercial worlds to each other. This ability grew more valuable as the financial crisis started to take hold.</p> <p>Highly articulate and adept at conveying complex ideas, Andrew was also a great raconteur when among friends. He was consistent in the candour, warmth, humour and personal concern he displayed to others, whether junior colleagues or heads of state.</p> <p>In 1966 he married Marjorie Hlavacek. She survives him, as do their children, Sandy, Keith and Inja.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Andrew Duncan Crockett, economist and public servant, born 23 March 1943; died 3 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>Residents of a block of flats near Newcastle have been told their homes will have to be demolished after their foundations were washed away by heavy floodwaters earlier this week.</p> <p>Dramatic pictures of the damage to the flats in Spencer Court, Newburn, showed the building looking perilous after the torrent left it in danger of collapsing. The pilings holding up the four-storey development were exposed by the flood, which was reportedly caused by a collapsed culvert.</p> <p>Residents moved out after concerns about their safety and on Thursday people in neighbouring developments were also asked to leave. At a public meeting on Thursday evening residents were told that some properties would be demolished, although it was not clear which homes were affected.</p> <p>Northumberland Estates, which represents the Duke of Northumberland's business interests, owns part of the flooded land.</p> <p>The Spencer Court development was built by Dunelm Homes.

  "<p>Light bulbs shimmer like stars across the ceiling of the Drum theatre for Rona Munro's play about American women in the early days of the space race.

It doesn't shirk from examining how personal rivalries are exacerbated when women have to compete for a single chair at a table where every other seat is occupied by&nbsp;men.</p> <p>Renee, the protagonist, is a self-made aviator who has risen from a poor childhood to fly high and fearlessly. When a man calls her \"a witch\", she replies, \"No, honey, they fly broomsticks. I use a Northrop jet.\" During the second world war, Renee helps with the war effort in the skies, and now, as America enters the space race in the 1950s, she is determined to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/jul/24/sally-ride\" title=\"\">the first female astronaut</a>. But Renee isn't getting any younger, and a high-flier called Jo is smashing Renee's air records to smithereens. Which one of them will make it into orbit? And will Russia's success in launching the first man into space, not to mention increasing cold war rivalries and the Cuban missile crisis, put paid to Renee and Jo's ambitions?</p> <p>The drama is a mite schematic in construction, and Simon Stokes's production is too slow and sane, never quite giving a dense and wordy play the surreal edge it needs as Renee's mind begins to disintegrate like a spent rocket falling back to earth. But it is performed with panache, particularly by Ingrid Lacey as the stylish, scheming Renee, and reminds us that in a world run by men, women are likely to find themselves grounded, however high they aspire.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Austerity mania is sweeping Europe. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's socialist government in France will become the latest to tighten its belt when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/28/eurozone-crisis-france-budget-spain-banks\" title=\"\">it announces \u20ac30bn (\u00a325bn) of spending cuts and tax increases</a> on Friday. This follows Spain's decision to take around <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/sep/27/eurozone-crisis-live-spain-greece-economy\" title=\"\">\u20ac40bn out of its budget</a> with the aim of hitting deficit reduction targets agreed with Brussels.</p> <p>Meanwhile, negotiations continue in Athens between Greece and the so-called troika (the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union) over a fresh package of spending cuts and tax increases now estimated at \u20ac13.5bn.</p> <p>All this is happening at a time when the eurozone economy is already going backwards. France announced zero growth in the second quarter \u2013 extending its period of stagnation to nine months. Spain's central bank warned earlier this week that the economy was currently contracting sharply, while Greece is already in the midst of a 1930s-style depression.</p> <p>The austerity programmes come with pledges of economic reforms. Put simply, the idea is that too many eurozone countries have been feather-bedded for too long and now need a chill blast of reality to wake them up. Budget retrenchment will ensure that countries live within their means while deregulation, privatisation and more flexible labour markets will make them leaner and fitter. Before too long a revitalised Europe will be punching above its weight in the global economy.</p> <p>All of which is total moonshine.</p> <p>Not one of the objectives set by Hollande, Mariano Rajoy in Spain or Antonis Samaras in Greece is likely to be met. The first goal is that budget deficits will come down rapidly as a result of austerity. All the evidence so far is that targets will be missed because demand will be sucked out of already pitifully weak economies, with the effects magnified because so many countries are acting in the same way simultaneously.</p> <p>A second fallacy is that the financial markets will be impressed by this self-flagellation. In the short-term that may be the case, but once the rotten economic data \u2013 for growth, unemployment and the public finances \u2013 starts to roll in, investors will take fright at the combination of bombed-out economies and rising debt-to-GDP ratios.</p> <p>Finally, there is the misguided notion that voters will stoically accept all this pain, seeing it as a price worth paying for the restoration of national solvency and to ensure the future of the eurozone. In the fantasy world inhabited by European policymakers, the future is brighter, richer, more harmonious.</p> <p>The general strike in Greece, the demonstrations in Madrid, the pressure for autonomy in Catalonia and the likely negative reaction in France to Hollande's budget, paint a rather different picture.</p> <p>In the real world, the insistence on pain, pain and yet more pain means permanent recession, toppled governments and growing hostility to the European Union. If it eventually leads to the breakup of the single currency because voters decide they have had enough, those running the show (sic) will have only themselves to blame.</p>",
  "<p>If few things are more irritating than a politician avoiding a question, what are we to make of an entire panel doing the same?</p> <p>Last night BBC Question Time took one of the more interesting questions we've heard for a while. With a mischievous glint, the questioner asked:</p> <p>\"Would the country be better served if we had more plebs and fewer poshos stalking the corridors of power.\"</p> <p>Dimbleby turned first, inevitably, to old Etonian caricature Jacob Rees-Mogg. His immediate (and only) reply was a kneejerk defence of public schools, suggesting that the important thing was that state schools produce pupils of the right calibre for the job. It's fortunate I didn't have any solid objects in my hand at that moment or it would have gone straight through the screen.</p> <p>How dare he? How dare that tubular balloon of hereditary privilege, who has sailed through life from prep school to Eton to Oxford to parliament, declare that people with a state school background are simply not up to the job of politics? Does he honestly believe that from 93% of the population we could not find a fair few with the intellect, wit, nous and talent to make the Bullingdon bullies, not to mention his good self, look like a troop of chattering gibbons?</p> <p>Private education was defended further by the honourable daughter of the 6th Baron Hindlip, Kirstie Allsopp, while Harriet Harman (St Paul's school) and Danny Alexander (rural comprehensive then PPE at Oxford) squeezed the last dregs from the Andrew Mitchell farce then indulged in some ginger rodent-related banter.</p> <p>In the midst of this carnival of rank smuggery sat one panellist who attended neither public school nor Oxbridge \u2013 Steve Coogan. In response to Rees-Mogg he said simply: \"Well, I went to a comprehensive school and it never did me any harm.\" That should have been the end to it, but up piped David Dimbleby (Charterhouse and PPE Oxford) with one of his witty interjections:</p> <p>\"Ah, but did it do you any good?\"</p> <p>Coogan gave him a momentary glance that could have boiled a canal and snapped: \"Well, I'm here aren't I?\"</p> <p>That brief exchanged captured the whole essence of the question and the problem. Yes, we need more plebs in the corridors of power, to make it less likely that a working class kid who graduated from Manchester University, and went on to become a global superstar as a writer and actor, could be asked on live TV whether his comprehensive schooling had done him any good. We need more plebs in politics so that when the Question Time panel is asked about austerity measures, one or two of them might really understand what it means to lose even a few quid a week in a benefit cut; or, when asked about dipping into the bank of Mum and Dad to buy a first home, might be able to talk about finding enough rent to stave off eviction by a landlord; or perhaps, when talking about the Rochdale grooming case, can explain from their own experience why some teenagers might be hanging out in a chip shop every evening? Those perspectives were missing from Question Time last night as they are missing from most editions, because those people are very largely excluded from the political establishment.</p> <p>Ed Miliband may not exactly be the typical comprehensive school kid, but I like to think he is absolutely right when he <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/news/913529-ed-miliband-as-a-state-school-boy-i-feel-your-pain\" title=\"\">told an interviewer</a>: \"I don't think I would be leader of the Labour party if it was not for my comprehensive school education.\" But this is not a party political issue. If I had to pick a couple of Tories to be on my team in an arse-to-elbow orienteering contest, I'd turn to David Davies and William Hague every time.</p> <p>If the question had been about political representation of ethnic minorities or women, the politicians would have known the script. They would have nodded seriously and agreed it is important that parliament reflects the country we have become. They would have traded boasts and excuses about their own party's performance and sworn to improve further. Not even Rees-Mogg would have implied that there just aren't enough women or black people out there with the ability to run the country. And yet when it comes to class, to education and to social background, they are oblivious, blinded by their own privilege and the myth of merit. Harman has devoted much of her career to the issue of women's representation, and yet on this she is struck mute.</p> <p>Yes, there are still some MPs from less privileged backgrounds, but few reach the front benches. Most are from older generations and will gradually be replaced by another apparatchik straight from PPE and central office. About 35% of MPs were privately educated \u2013 a minority, but vastly disproportionate to the population. The social background of Cameron's cabinet scarcely needs mentioning.</p> <p>Yes, we desperately need more plebs stalking the corridors of power. Unfortunately, we plebs look at the corridors of power and we do not see opportunity. Too often we see a parade of patronising, pompous, privileged, pricks.

Over the past few years, movements namechecked include mod (Marc Jacobs), rockers (Balmain) and rave (Raf Simons). Prepare for more next spring \u2013 collections explore punk (Maarten van der Horst, Sibling) and skaters. Young designer Thomas Tait even staged his London fashion week show in a skate park.</p> <p>While these scenes have become familiar style fodder, a documentary produced by Fred Perry and directed by Don Letts provides one yet to be completely plundered by the fashion world. See the British soul scene from the late 60s to the early 80s \u2013 a time when northern soul and the southern soul-boy scene developed in tandem.</p> <p>As Ross Winstanley, the founder of northern soul's famous Wigan Casino explains: \"Down south, it was all about the style and the looking good. We went: 'You know what? We're working so hard all week, we're gonna dance hard.'\" That meant a uniform designed for comfort when dancing to rare soul B-sides \u2013 wide-legged trousers for ventilation, vests on top for men, swirly skirts for girls. The soul-boy scene, says Robert Elms, was about contemporary soul and funk, and had an added element: fashion. \"It was about going out, dressing up and dancing,\" he remembers.</p> <p>Judging by envy-inducing footage of parties in Canvey Island, he's right. Clothes were essential to the scene; Hawaiian shirts, mohair jumpers, jelly sandals and brightly coloured jeans were popular. It was an environment, says Norman Jay, where \"black kids found the courage to express themselves in the clothes that they wore\".</p> <p>While the soul-boy scene, compared to its northern soul counterpart, remains relatively obscure 30 years later, elements of the era have started to make their way into fashion. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/gallery/2012/jul/31/stylish-holiday-in-pictures\">Azealia Banks has been spotted in jellies</a>, mohair was at Christopher Kane and Mulberry, Hawaiian prints have been reworked by Stella McCartney. The style potential of this untapped subculture \u2013 perhaps one of the last? \u2013 is ripe for the picking. </p> <p>Sorry purists, but it's only a matter of time until we see soul boys on the catwalk.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.fredperrysubculture.com/sub-sonic-live\" title=\"\">Watch the six-part 60 years of Subculture documentaries in full</a></p>",

  "<p><em>Clive Drinkwater is the regional director for </em><a href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/home.html\" title=\"\"><em>UK Trade &amp; Investment </em></a><em>in the north-west region</em></p> <p><strong>Adapt your products to different markets:</strong> Understanding your customer needs is a vital part of being a successful business anywhere, but is particularly important in exporting. You need to consider language and culture as well as taste and fashions.</p> <p>There are many benefits of getting started in exporting, but growing your ability to adapt and change to different market conditions is one of the most important. For example, if you're selling electrical products to the USA, you would need to make sure that they are 110-volt rather than 240-volt. Get it right with exporting and the evidence shows you will also grow your business in the UK.</p> <p><strong>Find a way to communicate locally: </strong>A famous Victorian travel guide said you only need to know how to say two things in any foreign language: \"do you speak English?\" and if the unfortunate answer is no \"then fetch me someone who does\". That sort of shout-loudly-and-slowly approach to foreign languages just won't cut it any more. Could you imagine how you would feel if a German company sent a German sales representative to you and wanted to conduct all his business in German? I predict he would be going home with no orders in his bag.</p> <p>Being able to communicate in the customer's language is therefore extremely important \u2013 but the good news is that this does not mean you have to go out and learn dozens of languages. If you have a good partner, agent or distributor in the market, they should look after this for you. For those markets where you are on your own, the services of an interpreter are worth their weight in gold. In China, for example, I've had good success with sourcing interpreters from students studying English at university. The most important thing is to have a plan for dealing with foreign languages. You could take advantage of a UKTI service, called an export communications review, where an expert will assess all your communications and help you to arrive at the best approach.</p> <p><em>Mike Cherry is national policy chairman for the </em><a href=\"http://www.fsb.org.uk/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>Federation of Small Businesses (FSB)</em></a></p> <p><strong>Do your research:</strong> You shouldn't rush into a new market without doing the research and thinking about the risks that you could face. While you may have success at home, can that be translated to another market?</p> <p>We have such a diverse membership that the issues they experience are wide-ranging. For example, there are issues with legislation in some countries where the customer can return goods even if they aren't damaged or faulty, at the expense of the business. Because our members are so small, the cost and logistics of producing, exporting and then potentially returning puts them off exporting.</p> <p><em>Tara Panjwani is the next generation and business services manager at the</em><a href=\"http://www.ukibc.com/\" title=\"\"><em> UK India Business Council (UKIBC) </em></a></p> <p><strong>Consider the Indian market:</strong> We strongly recommend that British exporters seriously consider selling to India which, despite the global economic downturn, has reported growth of 6.5% this fiscal year. This economic growth has been buoyed by increasing consumption expenditure, which has enabled India to remain resilient against the global recession. The Indian consumer has emerged as a powerful new phenomenon with greater aspirations for western products, higher disposable incomes, and a real affinity for British brands. India's middle class will reach 500 million by 2025 \u2013 a real force to be reckoned with. </p> <p><em>Mark Dodd is the head of International, </em><a href=\"http://www.lloydstsb.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Commercial Banking, Lloyds Banking Group</em></a></p> <p><strong>Bear these four things in mind: </strong></p> <p><strong>Securing payment:</strong> Talking to the bank early when negotiating the order can help identify the most appropriate way of doing this. There are a range of ways this can be done, from letters of credit (which need not be complex or scary to use), through to insurance cover and export factoring and so on.</p> <p><strong>Funding the cashflow needed:</strong> If the payment terms are secured in the right way, then banks have a range of ways \u2013 typically referred to as trade finance \u2013 in which they can provide the finance needed. In addition, through the export support schemes provided by UK Export Finance (also known as ECGD), the banks and company can obtain additional support, typically a 50% guarantee of the amount needed, for financing the order. UK Export Finance also provides insurance cover for contracts, which can also be useful in both securing and financing orders.</p> <p><strong>Risk \u2013 especially foreign exchange:</strong> Sadly, there is no easy answer to this one. Most would start by setting a budget rate at which they set their sales price and then look to fix the actual rate in relation to that budget rate, to avoid further exchange rate risk. There are lots of ways in which this can be done, and again an early discussion with your bank on what is most appropriate for your business is the best starting point.</p> <p><strong>Payment terms can be a question of risk:</strong> In the early stages of your business relationship with your export customers, and perhaps when the sales values are lower, asking for upfront payment is not a bad place to start. As your confidence in your customers grows then you can look at alternatives \u2013 there are a number of different ways of ensuring that you get paid, which don't involve you having to given unsecured payment terms to your customers as the only alternative to upfront payment. The international specialist at your bank should be able to discuss options with you, so that you can make an informed decision about what works best for you as you build your export business. An early conversation with them could be very helpful.</p> <p><em>Anna Richey and Alla Ouvarova are co-founders and co-directors of </em><a href=\"http://www.twochicks.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Two Chicks</em></a></p> <p><strong>Plan your marketing:</strong> Definitely don't export to a country unless you or your chosen distribution company has some marketing planned. Without this, not only could sales be poor but you could spoil your reputation in that country before you have even begun. Without wanting to state the obvious \u2013 do your research. Very few things will sell everywhere; no point trying to sell umbrellas to a country where it never rains.</p> <p><em>Ruma Deb is an international business executive at </em><a href=\"http://londonchamber.co.uk/lcc_public/home.asp\" title=\"\"><em>London Chamber of Commerce</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>Trade missions can be valuable:</strong> Our clients have identified distributors via our trade missions. While this is an additional cost, the return on your investment can be rewarding. Trade missions are not as costly as you might think, and we usually have travel grants available, delivered by UKTI.</p> <p><strong>Start exporting close to home:</strong> Europe an ideal testing ground due to favourable export conditions, for example removal of barriers to trade including administrative procedures, customs duties, and so on. With eurozone countries, exchange rate risks or unfavourable rates are minimised and there is more transparency in comparing prices and competitiveness of goods and services.</p> <p><em>David Williams is the chief executive of the manufacturing company </em><a href=\"http://www.taylorbins.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Egbert H Taylor</em></a></p> <p><strong>Don't jump into trade missions: </strong>I would counsel real caution before going on a trade mission and ask \"is it a market that fits your criteria?\" If it does, then it's certainly worth a closer look; if not, it could be an enjoyable but expensive distraction for a small SME.

  "<p>Australian officials, under pressure to protect beachgoers after a string of deadly shark attacks, have approved a plan to kill sharks that venture too close to people in the water.</p> <p>The plan, <a href=\"http://www.mediastatements.wa.gov.au/Pages/Results.aspx?ItemId=151064\" title=\"\">which was announced by Western Australia state premier, Colin Barnett, on Thursday</a>, has infuriated conservationists and marks a sharp reversal of the current policy that permits the killing of sharks only after they have attacked.</p> <p>\"We will always put the lives and safety of beachgoers ahead of the shark,\" Barnett told ABC radio. \"This is, after all, a fish \u2013 let's keep it in perspective.\"</p> <p>Barnett, along with the state fisheries minister, Norman Moore, announced the policy change as part of a AU$6.85m (\u00a34.41m)) package of \"shark mitigation strategies\" aimed at reducing the risk of attacks on beachgoers.</p> <p>There have been five fatal shark attacks in Western Australia in the past year, prompting some residents to demand a more aggressive shark management plan. The new funding will pay for a fisheries department service to track, catch and kill sharks that get too close to swimmers, a study of shark enclosures at beaches, more jet skis for lifeguards and a GPS tracking program.</p> <p>Great white sharks are a protected species in Australian waters, but the new policy would allow fisheries department officials to kill any great whites that present an \"imminent threat to people\", Moore said.</p> <p>After an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15414385\" title=\"\">American diver was killed by a great white in Western Australia last year</a>, the government set tuna-baited hooks to try and snare the predator. It was the first time authorities used an emergency legal exemption from the state protection of great whites to hunt the animal in the interest of protecting the public. The shark was never caught.</p> <p>The Conservation Council of Western Australia praised the additional funds for research and increased patrols but slammed the new pre-emptive kill policy as ineffective.</p> <p>\"We are concerned that plans to kill sharks that approach beaches applies a 'guilty until proven innocent' approach to sharks and is a knee-jerk reaction to public concern that will harm the environment without protecting swimmers,\" the council's marine coordinator Tim Nicol <a href=\"http://ccwa.org.au/media/%E2%80%98guilty-until-proven-innocent%E2%80%99-not-right-approach-large-sharks\" title=\"\">said in a statement</a>.</p> <p>Sharks are common in Australian waters, though the nation has averaged just over one fatal attack a year over the past 50 years.</p>",

Having conquered Korea and Japan (where they were named \"Korean group Japanese fans want to see most\") the band went on to win best worldwide act in the Asia-Pacific category at the 2011 MTV Europe music awards, and their YouTube channel has received more than 400m views.

They were the \"juggernaut leading the Korean Wave across Asia, the embodiment of the ultra-slick choreography and catchy pop songs that earned K-pop its reputation\", says Robert Poole, chief executive of SomethingDrastic, a Tokyo-based Asian music promoter. In less than five years, the nine-member group have amassed sales of more than 30m digital singles and 4.4m albums. Girls' Generation exemplify the global ambition of K-pop's wily promoters: their 2011 single The Boys was released in Korean, Japanese and, for the first time, English. This year they became the first Korean act to perform on The Late Show With David Letterman, and the first on syndicated TV in the US. In 2011 they earned more than US$88m for their label, SM Entertainment, and are expected to earn double that this year.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XboGRNb1Fd8&amp;feature=player_embedded\">U-Kiss</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XboGRNb1Fd8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XboGRNb1Fd8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The clue to U-Kiss's ambition is in their name: Ubiquitous Korean International Idol SuperStar. They are considered the underdogs of the Korean boyband scene, but their following overseas is \"something else\", according to Scobie. Their fans, known as KissMe's, have turned to social media to spread the group's name, resulting in concerts in France, Thailand, the US, Colombia and Cambodia. Like many of their K-pop contemporaries, U-Kiss have a loyal following in Japan. If, as some expect, they make it in the US, chatshow appearances shouldn't be a problem: several members of the band speak English, including AJ, who recently took time off to study at Columbia University. Their new single, Stop Girl, released this month, was recorded in Korean and English, and is being promoted in 10 countries, including the US, China and Japan.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ZHXVp_wUE&amp;feature=player_embedded\">Sistar</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E0ZHXVp_wUE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E0ZHXVp_wUE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>These relative newcomers to the K-pop scene have already made one comeback since their debut in 2010. \"In a sea of bubblegum-cute popsters, Sistar stand out for their cool and sexy image,\" says Scobie. The band's eagerly awaited summer single, Loving U, immediately topped major online music charts in South Korea, although they have yet to make much of an impact internationally. That could all change soon, though: the group's lead singer, Hyorin, has been likened to Beyonc\u00e9 for her husky voice, incredible range and soulful contributions to songs that, unusually perhaps for this genre, deal as much with falling out of love as falling in love. The group were the centre of controversy when their saucy \"butt dance\" for How Dare You was banned on South Korean TV.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckIGhwQtd-c&amp;feature=player_embeddedhttp://\">Beast</a></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ckIGhwQtd-c?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ckIGhwQtd-c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The six-member boyband came in for some unkind press coverage when they debuted in 2009.

  "<p>Having recently started working in the co-operative movement, I have noticed that co-operatives are good at promoting themselves among themselves, but often forget the wider public. Before I started working at Co-operative News, I only associated the movement with the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group</a>, and had no idea that there were more than 5,000 co-ops of various sizes in the UK.</p> <p>However the more I learned about them, the more I wanted everyone else to as well. To me, co-ops, mutuals, credit unions and social enterprises are the solution to the current economic and political crisis. I believe that businesses need to be responsible, to think about consequences and put people over profit. Co-operatives and credit unions have been resilient throughout the financial and economic crisis, which shows that <a href=\"http://www.thenews.coop/article/co-operatives-grow-twice-rate-uk-economy\" title=\"\">it is possible to be successful and ethical in business</a>.</p> <p>Here are my tips to help better promote your business, as well as the co-operative and ethical business model.</p> <h2><strong>Tell your story</strong></h2> <p>Make sure you have a well maintained, easy to navigate website. It is a crucial customer-facing marketing tool; this is how the majority of your new customers will find you \u2013 and first impressions count. Use your website to tell your story, what your company's achievements have been and what you are aiming to do in the future.</p> <h2><strong>Form a social connection</strong></h2> <p>Set up a Facebook page or Twitter account, or both, and form social connections with your customers and other people connected to your sector. Social enterprises, co-operatives, mutuals and credit unions all have many things in common. There are also thousands of people interested in ethical and social issues, so find your organisation's champions. Keep everything light and conversational.</p> <h2><strong>Connect with emotions</strong></h2> <p>You should also be aiming your communications at the increasingly <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304141204577507031967692116.html\" title=\"\">disillusioned public</a> and letting them know that there is an alternative. Start by telling your local papers, radio and television about the positive impact your work has been having on the community. It's all very well hearing from your managing director or chief executive about profits and quarterly figures, but the real stories are about the people whose lives have been changed by your actions. Whether this is creating new employment opportunities for the disadvantaged or providing a service to your community, these are the stories that will resonate and help reinforce a positive image for the movement.</p> <h2><strong>Position yourself as an alternative</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.sixtowns.co.uk/\" title=\"\">6Towns Credit Union</a> is a prime example of how successful positioning yourself as an alternative can be. 6Towns operates in one of the most socially deprived areas of the country. Its founders had become worried by the increasing number of pay-day loan companies and high-interest providers in their community. So they decided to launch their own pay-day loan at a capped 26.8% APR.</p> <p>The local radio covered the loans on their breakfast radio show, with a recorded interview with someone who had used the credit union and a live piece with one of the directors. BBC West Midlands featured them on the midday news and their Inside Out programme, and on several occasions for live interviews since.</p> <p>Following this publicity, 6Towns had a surge of new members, glad of an alternative to the traditional banks and the high-interest pay-day loans.</p> <p><em>Annie Warren is Co-operative relations manager for the </em><a href=\"http://www.thenews.coop/\" title=\"\"><em>Co-operative News</em></a><em>, the Global News Hub for co-operatives.

  "<p>Twenty new gas-fired power stations are likely to be built in the UK, amounting to a massive increase in consumption of the fossil fuel, the climate and energy secretary, Ed Davey, has told the Guardian.</p> <p>But Davey insisted the expansion \u2013 the biggest construction effort in the power sector for decades \u2013 would not harm the prospects for investment in renewable energy or in the government's carbon reduction targets.</p> <p>He said: \"I strongly support more gas, just as I strongly support more renewable energy. We need a big expansion of renewable energy and of gas if we are to tackle our climate change challenges.\"</p> <p>Davey is expected to announce a new gas strategy this autumn, which will require the investment of hundreds of billions of pounds in new electricity generation capacity and dictate the shape and construction of the UK's energy infrastructure for decades to come. But environmental groups and renewable energy investors are concerned that a new \"dash for gas\" would put carbon targets beyond reach and deter investment in renewables.</p> <p>Joss Garman, political director of Greenpeace, said: \"Green-lighting a whole fleet of new fossil fuel power stations would cause a huge jump in emissions and blow this autumn's once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace dirty power stations with clean ones.\"</p> <p>Davey said the government was planning to add 20GW of electricity generation capacity from gas, between now and 2030. That is about ten times the current capacity for generating renewable energy from offshore windfarms. As of Thursday, when a new offshore windfarm was opened off the north Norfolk coast, the UK had 2GW offshore wind-generating capacity \u2013 more than any other country.</p> <p>Davey said: \"People who see the UK's energy future as a competition between renewable and gas are misreading the next phase.\"</p> <p>However, this is in contrast to the arguments put forward by aides to George Osborne, the chancellor, who do see the two in competition \u2013 they have insisted that investment in renewable energy was in danger of crowding out investment in gas.</p> <p>Each new gas-fired power plant is likely to have a useful life of about 25 years. Davey also supports a target of decarbonising the electricity sector by 2030, so this would imply fitting new gas-fired power stations with technology to capture and store carbon dioxide, either on construction or subsequently. There are no full-scale power stations currently running with CCS technology, which has suffered serious delays.</p> <p>Greenpeace's Garman said investment in renewable energy was the way to cut emissions: \"Only days ago Ed Davey and Danny Alexander said they were fully committed to achieving completely carbon-free power in the UK by 2030. Nick Clegg can't afford to make this another 'sorry'.\"</p> <p>Davey attended the opening of the UK's latest offshore windfarm off the north Norfolk coast on Thursday, a \u00a31.2bn projected called <a href=\"http://www.scira.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sheringham Shoal</a>. The major investors in the project are from Norway, emphasising the strong trend for investment in the UK's energy infrastructure to come mainly from overseas companies.</p> <p>Christian Rynning-T\u00f8nnesen, chief executive of Statkraft, the Norwegian power utility that has invested in Sheringham Shoal, said the UK's wind resources and regulatory regime made it the most attractive location in Europe for offshore wind investors.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1yyMbuQBByE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1yyMbuQBByE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The Norwegian company is looking at a huge expansion of offshore wind in the North Sea, along with the German utility RWE and Scottish and Southern Energy. The Dogger Bank could support up to 9GW of offshore windfarms, but this investment is likely to take more than a decade.</p> <p>Rynning-T\u00f8nnesen said he was seeking new offshore windfarm projects to invest in. But he warned that if there were no suitable opportunities in the UK, the company would take its investment elsewhere. He added that the government's plans for reforming the electricity market could work, but were still unclear.</p>",
  "<p>In the middle of the night of 19 February 2005, 20-year-old Sonia T\u00e1bora went into premature labour at seven months, alone, in a coffee plantation near her home in rural El Salvador. Her family found her collapsed, haemorrhaging and in a state of shock, and took her to a health centre in search of help. T\u00e1bora explained what happened, but the doctor accused her of provoking an abortion and reported her to the police. She was shackled to her bed, presumed guilty and transferred to a hospital to remand as though she were a dangerous criminal. She was then sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder.</p> <p>Her trial fell far short of international standards: no autopsy was carried out and the prosecution presented no evidence, relying solely on the opinion of the doctor and the conjecture of the judge. T\u00e1bora suffered a mental breakdown and spent more than seven years in prison <a href=\"http://europeanprochoicenetwork.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/el-salvador-woman-jailed-for-30-years-for-miscarriage-has-been-freed/\" title=\"\">before being released on 14 August 2012</a>, following a review of her sentence. The tribunal judges did not admit there had been a judicial error, and she has not been awarded compensation or exonerated of the crime.</p> <p>T\u00e1bora's case is emblematic of women's experience under El Salvador's abortion law \u2013 one of the most restrictive in the world. Previous legal access to abortion in cases of rape, incest, a threat to the woman's life or health or severe foetal abnormality was repealed in 1998, and abortion was criminalised in all circumstances: even to save a woman's life. Abortion is punishable with up to eight years in prison, but if the foetus is deemed to have been viable, the charge is habitually converted to murder, which carries a sentence of 30 to 50 years.</p> <p>The effects of this criminalisation are causing widespread human rights violations and reflect systemic discrimination against women in the region. Full details of the scope and impact of abortion laws in El Salvador are documented by the Central America Women's Network (Cawn) in a <a href=\"http://cawn.org/assets/Maternal%20Health%20paper_final.pdf\" title=\"\">paper</a> on reproductive rights and abortion in Central America, published on 28 September to coincide with the <a href=\"http://www.september28.org/\" title=\"\">Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion</a>. As well as imposing criminal sanctions for accessing an essential component of reproductive healthcare, this has led to the arbitrary imprisonment of women who have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth. There are at least <a href=\"http://www.contrapunto.com.sv/genero/entrevista-aborto-tortura-y-violencia-a-mujeres\" title=\"\">24 women with circumstances similar</a> to those of T\u00e1bora serving sentences of 30 years or more in El Salvador, and hundreds more who have been imprisoned for having an abortion. Young women from poor backgrounds who lose their babies come under immediate suspicion.</p> <p>The manner and speed with which reports are made \u2013 prior to any investigation or gathering of evidence \u2013 violates the right to the presumption of innocence and there is a systematic failure to uphold guarantees of judicial process, the rights to a fair trial and equal protection of the law. Women can be left to die from an ectopic pregnancy or obstetric emergency, can be denied life-saving treatment while pregnant if it could provoke a miscarriage and are reluctant to seek medical help after a miscarriage in case they are accused of procuring an abortion. Together, these issues constitute systemic discrimination against women \u2013 in particular those with a low income, rural women and adolescent girls.</p> <p>Lack of access to reproductive healthcare also affects women's ability to participate on an equal basis with men in public life. It has a particularly detrimental impact on access to work and education, perpetuating socio-economic and educational disadvantage, increasing gender inequalities and <a href=\"http://reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/persecuted1.pdf\" title=\"\">feminising poverty</a>: it shapes a society which is inherently unfair and unequal.</p> <p>It is accepted that the criminalisation of abortion <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/Sedgh-Lancet-2012-01.pdf\" title=\"\">does not stop abortions taking place</a>; it leads to unsafe, illegal abortions, which may take place in unsanitary conditions, often result in complications and death, and are <a href=\"http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/unsafe_abortion/en/index.html\" title=\"\">one of the main causes of maternal mortality</a> in countries where abortion is banned. The criminalisation of abortion translates as this: some lives are more equal than others.</p> <p>Nancy Northup, president of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, has <a href=\"http://reproductiverights.org/en/press-room/center-for-reproductive-rights-files-case-revealing-the-horrifying-reality-of-el-salvador\" title=\"\">said</a> that \"liberalising restrictive abortion laws, like El Salvador's, is essential to saving the lives and protecting the health of millions of women across the globe every year. Study after study has shown there are no positive outcomes to banning abortion outright.\"</p> <p>I'll take this further: there are only negative outcomes \u2013 not only for the individual women who are penalised or who die as a result of clandestine abortion, but also for any prospect of a fair and equal society.</p>",

Spider's best friend is a fly and it is obvious that fly's parents are not entirely comfortable with this.  Luke liked the silly teacher who didn't realise they were talking to spiders moulted skin! He also liked the bit where spider goes to give Daddy Long Legs a piece of his mind, and then when he sees how big he is decides to give him a piece of his lunch instead!  The pictures are really good with lots of detail for you to pick out. I would suggest this book is probably better for a slightly older child who could appreciate the humour, and could read the captions on some of the illustrations.<br>Photograph: Public Domain</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Action images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395428918\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346340410582/The-Pirate-House-by-Rebec-001.jpg\" alt=\"Family favourites: The Pirate House by Rebecca Patterson\" width=\"482\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/childrens-books-site/2012/aug/29/family-reviews-pirate-house-rebecca-patterson?INTCMP=SRCH\">The Pirate House by Rebecca Patterson</a> <br/><strong>Jennifer and Minnie, aged 1.</strong><br/>  Minnie loves this book, and I mean really loves it - she requests it morning, noon and night!

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/wheatley_review.htm\" title=\"\">Martin Wheatley's 10-point plan</a> to overhaul the way the Libor market operates could eventually give him key responsibility for the ultimate oversight of a rate that affects $300 trillion (\u00a3185tn) of financial products around the world.</p> <p>In calling for the government to give the Financial Services Authority <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/28/libor-riggers-jailed-fsa-regulator\" title=\"\">powers to regulate the submission and administration of Libor</a>, Wheatley is essentially putting himself in charge; when the FSA is disbanded next year he will head the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to which the responsibility will be transferred.</p> <p>In the foreword to his 92-page final report, commissioned by the Treasury in the aftermath of the \u00a3290m fine on Barclays, the FSA managing director and chief executive-designate of the FCA promises \"swift and decisive\" action to restore confidence in the crucial benchmark rate.</p> <p>The Treasury appears ready to back the proposals drawn up after a short consultation. Greg Clark, financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Libor is a hugely important international benchmark and this report makes a series of comprehensive and practical recommendations designed to restore its credibility.\"</p> <p>Giving the FSA regulatory powers over the submission of the rates is the first of the suggestions Wheatley makes to the government for restoring a system he describes as \"broken\".</p> <p>Among the key other recommendations are:</p> <p>\u2022 Managers who oversee the individuals who make submissions to Libor should be approved by the FSA to make it easier to discipline them.</p> <p>\u2022 The British Bankers' Association should be stripped of its role in setting Libor and a tender will be put out on Friday for a successor body to replace the trade organisation that gave banks \"unfettered latitude\" in submitting rates. The BBA accepted its removal from a role it has held for 25 years. \"The absolute priority now for everyone is to ensure the provision of a reliable benchmark which has the confidence and support of all users, contributors and global regulators,\" the BBA said.</p> <p>\u2022 Criminal sanctions should be introduced for anyone who attempts to manipulate Libor by amending the Financial Services and Market Act to allow the FSA to prosecute manipulation of the rate</p> <p>\u2022 The new body that oversees the administration of Libor, replacing the BBA, should introduce a \"code of conduct\" that requires submissions to be corroborated by trade data</p> <p>\u2022 Libor is set by a panel of banks asked the price at which they expect to borrow over 15 periods, from overnight to 12 months, in 10 currencies. But the proposal is to reduce the 150 benchmark rates to just 20 \u2013 in five currencies and four maturities. The report found that 52.8% of financial instruments are priced off three-month dollar Libor</p> <p>\u2022 The rates the banks submit are published shortly afterwards. But Wheatley recommends more banks get involved and that the individual rates submitted should not be published for three months to avoid a rerun of 2008 when, at the height of the banking crisis, banks might have deliberately lowered rates to mask any idea they were in financial difficulty.</p> <p>Wheatley himself, though, acknowledged that while his report is \"final\" it will not be the last word on a subject that has dominated the financial markets for three months.</p>",
  "<p>Two senior executives at G4S have resigned over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/11/g4s-failed-olympic-security-lord-coe\" title=\"\">the company's failure to deliver its contract for the London 2012 Olympics</a>, but chief executive Nick Buckles has kept his job.</p> <p>David Taylor-Smith, chief operating officer, and Ian Horseman-Sewell, managing director for G4S Global Events, are stepping down following the firm's failure to meet its Olympics commitments. The G4S board, though, has concluded Buckles should stay on \"in the best interest of the company and all of its stakeholders\".</p> <p>Taylor-Smith and Horseman-Sewell are leaving following an inquiry into the Olympics debacle by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It found G4S had failed to strengthen its management and its \"structures and processes\" to handle the \"unique and complex\" task of delivering more than 10,000 trained guards to protect Olympic venues.</p> <p>G4S summarised PwC's conclusions in a statement to the stock market on Friday morning. It said: \"The company has management and other structures and processes that have proved highly effective in delivering the company's regular business over many years but it did not recognise these structures and processes needed augmenting for the Olympic contract.</p> <p>\"The monitoring and tracking of the security workforce, management information and the project management framework and practices were ineffective to address the scale, complexities and dependencies of the Olympic contract. Together this caused the failure of the company to deliver the contract requirements in full and resulted in the identification of the key problems at a very late stage.\"</p> <p>G4S's failure meant the British army was called in to provide security during the Olympics fortnight.</p> <p>The G4S chairman, John Connolly, said the company admitted it had not delivered. He said: \"G4S has accepted responsibility for its failure to deliver fully on the Olympic contract. We apologise for this and we thank the military and the police for the vital roles they played in ensuring the delivery of a safe and secure Games.\"</p> <p>Buckles faced heavy criticism when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/17/nick-buckles-g4s-olympic-chaos\" title=\"\">he appeared before the home affairs committee in July</a>, where David Winnick MP told him the company's reputation was in tatters.</p> <p>The G4S board, though, has concluded that Buckles should not lose his job.</p> <p>\"Whilst the chief executive has ultimate responsibility for the company's performance, the review did not identify significant shortcomings in his performance or serious failings attributable to him in connection with the Olympic contract,\" it said.</p> <p>Keith Vaz MP, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, welcomed the departures of Taylor-Smith and Horseman-Sewell.</p> <p>\"This is the right decision by senior officials at G4S to take responsibility for the fiasco of G4S's involvement in Olympic security preparations. This however does not represent closure. As the Home Affairs committee recommended, G4S must address outstanding issues concerning the waiving of the management fee and the ex gratia payments it should make to the employees it treated in such a cavalier fashion.</p> <p>\"A strong and clear message to companies that receive taxpayers money has been sent. Those who fail to deliver on contracts must pay the ultimate price. It is now imperative that the government set up the procurement risk register that the committee recommends,\" Vaz said.</p>",
  "<p>With the UK government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/17/gas-fracking-gets-green-light\">expected to give the go-ahead for shale gas</a> exploitation \"soon\", it's a good time to re-enter the smoke and mirrors world of fracking.</p> <p>There are plenty of people bubbling with excitement at the prospect of the drilling beginning. They argue that shale gas has been the biggest cause of carbon dioxide emission cuts in the US recently, thanks to the replacement of coal. It's cheap too, they say, again pointing again to the US, and there's a vast amount under our feet here in the UK, just waiting to be freed. Lastly, shale gas is popular with the free market enthusiasts who lambast the subsidies given to renewable energy. Yet not one of these arguments stand up.</p> <p>Let's take the emissions cuts first. In May, the International Energy Agency claimed that annual US emissions fell by 1.7% in 2011 \"<a href=\"http://www.iea.org/newsroomandevents/news/2012/may/name,27216,en.html\">primarily due to on-going switching from coal to natural gas</a> in power generation and an exceptionally mild winter.\" The coal-to-gas switch has been driven by gas prices that are falling due to large volumes of shale gas. But a <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/us-emissions-report\">new analysis of US government energy data by Greenpeaces's upcoming energy news site, <em>Energydesk</em></a> shows renewable energy in fact played a bigger role than gas in cutting climate-warming gases.</p> <p>The analysis shows that electricity generation from coal did indeed fall significantly from 2010-2011, by 113TWh. But gas generation rose only by 29TWh. Generation from wind, hydro-electricity and other renewables rose by three times that amount: 92TWh. Looking at a longer period, 2008-11, coal's share of the US power mix fell by over 6%, while gas rose by 3.3%, Greenpeace found. But renewable generation rose by 3.6% and, given that renewable energy emits far less carbon than gas, again we see that renewable energy is contributing the lion's share of the emissions cuts. (It's worth noting at this point that the UK's renewable energy generation grew by 6.5% in the last year.)</p> <h2>Cheap trick</h2> <p>Fracking's boosters might well say, forget carbon, shale gas is going to be cheap. Not so, again. \"Shale will not be a 'cheap' source of gas and there is unlikely to be a repeat of the US experience,\" says a <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/287378ee-0708-11e2-92ef-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz27fODtLJt\">new report from the Energy Contract Company</a> (ECC), reported in the FT. In fact, they reach the same conclusion as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/03/shale-gas-game-changer-fracking\">Deutsche bank had already</a>, and for very similar reasons: tougher regulation, different mineral rights.</p> <p>The CBI, which represents over 250,000 UK businesses, is also deeply unconvinced about the prospect of cheap shale gas. Its director general, <a href=\"http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2208266/cbi-rejects-calls-for-allout-dash-for-gas\">John Cridland, said this week</a>: \"Look at European gas price projections. They all disagree on the number, but they all agree on the direction \u2013 up. European shale will help, but not on a US scale.\"</p> <p>These arguments appear immaterial to ex-BP boss <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e29af70e-00a2-11e2-9dfc-00144feabdc0.html\">Lord John Browne, who again used the US example to argue in the FT</a> that \"the prize is substantial\" if \"good practice and the UK's tough safety regulations mean [fracking] can be performed safely and without endangering water supplies.\" What the FT failed to tell its readers in Browne's article was that he is a director of <a href=\"http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/\">Cuadrilla Resources Holdings Ltd</a>, the main fracking company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/10/cuadrilla-breach-fracking-lancashire\">drilling in the UK</a>. Perhaps he meant the prize for his company would be substantial?</p> <p>Ed Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/westminster/2012/09/lord-browne-versus-ed-davey-fracking-row-hots-up/#ixzz27fOeFMRS\">derided Browne's \"regrettably partial\" analysis</a> and addressed the myth that shale gas is all set to flow and transform the UK's energy future: \"Until we have more certainty about the potential scale and costs of shale gas production in the UK it is unwise to assume it will be some kind of silver bullet.\"</p> <p>New energy minister John Hayes, who is no green having (wrongly) labelled wind power as a \"failure\" on both environmental and economic grounds, recently said the same in parliament: \"Shale gas in the UK is still in its earliest days; just one well in the UK has been drilled and fracked, and the production prospects are unknown at this stage.\" Several geologists have told me that you need hundreds, or even a thousand wells, before you really know how much gas you're going to get out. </p> <p>The ECC report projected that shale gas production might hit about a quarter of UK demand by 2030 - the same year by which the UK has to decarbonise its electricity supply, according to the Libdems, Labour and the government's official advisors, the Committee on climate change. </p> <h2>Hostage to fortune</h2> <p>That, as the <a href=\"http://www.imeche.org/news/press-release/12-09-18/Shale_gas_exploitation_will_help_rebalance_economy_say_engineers.aspx\">Institution of Mechanical Engineers point out in their recent report</a>, means \"the development of shale gas must be coupled with the development of carbon capture and storage technology for use with gas-fired power plants.\" CCS isn't going to be cheap and the IME's Tim Fox added: \"UK shale gas could make a helpful contribution to the UK's energy security, but it is not the silver bullet many claim it is. It is unlikely to have a major impact on energy prices. A general over-reliance on gas will render the UK a hostage to volatile global energy markets, with or without UK shale gas.\"</p> <p>Lastly, let's tackle the idea that shale gas conquered the US without the huge subsidies critics say are need to prop up renewable energy. \"The <a href=\"http://www.bseec.org/content/us-carbon-emissions-are-declining-thanks-natural-gas-and-free-market\">free market has worked its magic</a>,\" the Barnett Shale Energy Education Council, an industry group, claimed in July, reported AP. But again, this isn't true, as <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/decades-federal-dollars-helped-fuel-gas-boom\">AP's article goes on to reveal</a>: \"Over three decades, from the shale fields of Texas and Wyoming to the Marcellus in the Northeast, the federal government contributed more than $100 million in research to develop fracking, and billions more in tax breaks.\"</p> <p>So there we have it. Shale gas from UK fracking might, with state help and many years from now, produce a relatively small amount of gas, which won't reduce gas prices and would bust our carbon budgets unless emissions are expensively buried. I am not opposed to shale gas in principle, if all the environmental concerns are addressed, especially methane leakage. But as I think the analysis above shows clearly it's not so much a silver bullet as a lead balloon.</p>",

  "<p>The Niger government took the brave decision last year <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/niger-warns-of-looming-food-crisis\" title=\"\">to sound the alarm early on hunger</a> \u2013 the rainy season, from July to September, had been well below average and a drop in food production looked likely.</p> <p>One year later, the picture is very different. This time the alarm is being raised by NGOs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/gallery/2012/aug/24/niger-floods-in-pictures\" title=\"\">to help an estimated 500,000 affected by flooding in Niger</a>. \"[It's] the last thing Niger needed,\" said Samuel Braimah, Oxfam's country director.</p> <p>Despite the flooding, the rains are welcome news for approximately 15 million people in six countries in the Sahel threatened by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/graphic/2012/mar/09/sahel-food-crisis-map\" title=\"\">a food crisis</a> sparked by drought last year. Across the region, above average rainfall has been recorded in 2012. Predictions for southern Mali by Fewsnet, the US early warning system, suggest at least 93% of the millet crop will be successful. Although there have been pockets of drought, and the rains may be in danger of petering out before October in some regions, anecdotal evidence suggests prices in local markets are starting to ease.</p> <p>But good news on the rains risks signalling that everything is back to normal. Oxfam is trying to stop donor and media attention turning elsewhere, saying: \"The food crisis is far from over and an increase in aid is still needed to help farmers and herders overcome the triple challenges of recurrent droughts, persistent poverty and political instability.\"</p> <p>The Sahel crisis is about much more than rain, or lack of it. Yes, in the years when the rains fail more people are pushed into hunger, but the NGO message is that this is something that will take years to fix. \"Deep-rooted change is what is needed, not just a good harvest,\" says Denise Brown, head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in Niger.</p> <p>Three droughts since 2005 have left millions of families locked out of the food-production cycle. Almost everyone in the region has lost animals, and many have been unable to buy seed for replanting. When crops fail, some families are unable to find the cash to buy supplementary food on the market as prices have been pushed so high. It is thought that the long-term development of millions of children is being affected by \"stunting\", caused by a poor diet over many years.</p> <p>These chronic problems need sustained solutions. Efforts to change farming practices to promote irrigation and protection of water sources must go hand in hand with education, the promotion of women's rights, teaching people about child nutrition, and long-term efforts to promote drought-resistant crop varieties and the creation of grain stores. Initiatives such as Niger's <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/niger/national-strategy-against-famine\" title=\"\">Trois N</a>'s are homegrown attempts to tackle chronic food security in all its aspects.</p> <p>\"One good harvest doesn't lead automatically to self-sufficiency in food production,\" says Mamadou Diop from Action Against Hunger, ACF International in Bamako. \"It's hard to explain to donors that there are people who have basically been living with malnourishment for many years, even when the harvest has been 'normal'.\"</p> <p>And while things may be looking fairly positive in Niger \u2013 where the government of President Mahamadou Issoufou, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/22/niger-election-tandja-issoufou-chatelot\" title=\"\">in place since April 2011</a>, has tried to show itself to be committed to tackling food insecurity \u2013 the picture is not so rosy elsewhere. The political crisis in neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/13/international-response-mali-inadequate\" title=\"\">Mali has only compounded the hunger problem</a>. More than 300,000 people have been displaced in the Islamist takeover of the north, leaving behind animals and untended fields and fleeing to refugee camps, where they depend on handouts.</p> <p>\"Displaced people cannot plant their seeds, and have no access to money to buy food,\" says Mbacke Niang, Oxfam's country director in Bamako. \"Security and logistics for us in the north have become so much more complicated since the collapse of government authority there.\"</p> <p>Overall, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/mar/09/urgent-action-sahel-humanitarian-emergecny\" title=\"\">the donor response to the 2011-12 Sahel appeal</a> has been quite good. Nearly 60% of the funds required have been provided so far. Although there has been an obvious peak in the number of malnourished under-fives being treated in hospitals across the whole region, anecdotal evidence suggests the numbers have been below the 1 million severely acutely malnourished babies predicted by NGOs earlier in the year. The worst of the lean season is now over, and the first harvest is about to be collected.</p> <p>This seeming success may be attributable to aid agencies sounding the alarm early at the end of 2011 \u2013 in part because many had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/feb/16/east-africa-crisis-response-effective-not-fast\" title=\"\">stung by criticisms of a late response to last year's famine in Somalia</a>. And, according to Brown, the aid effort was co-ordinated. \"Everybody played their role \u2013 there was no squabbling between NGOs, and the parameters of intervention were clear. High-level visits are still going on, and donors can see a glimmer of hope here.\"</p>"
