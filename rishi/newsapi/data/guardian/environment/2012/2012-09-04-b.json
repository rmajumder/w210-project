  "<p>David Cameron shifted the political gravity of his government firmly to the right in a substantial government reshuffle that left Nick Clegg weakened and raised the prospect of a series of fresh coalition disputes over crime, the environment and business-friendly policies.</p> <p>In the only serious setback for Cameron and his closest ally George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith insisted on staying at work and pensions secretary, so raising the prospect of a battle as the Treasury demands a second round of big welfare cuts next year to bring the deficit-reduction programme back under control.</p> <p>Heavy-handed Treasury briefing on Monday night prompted Duncan Smith to reject the offer of succeeding Kenneth Clarke as justice secretary.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the tough employment minister, has instead been handed the role and will use the portfolio to challenge European judicial interference in British government decisions.</p> <p>A senior Tory minister said: \"Overall this is a serious lurch to the right.\"</p> <p>Downing Street itself billed the reshuffle, the only major recasting of government planned ahead of the 2015 election, as an attempt to promote ministers capable of delivering on policies already announced. In a symbol of the commitment to delivery, Cameron has appointed Locog chief executive, Paul Deighton, as Treasury minister based in the Lords to deliver infrastructure.</p> <p>Although No 10 said the reshuffle did not mean any change in coalition policy, a string of appointments signalled otherwise. Cameron demoted Andrew Lansley, the health secretary, after the debacle over health reforms in the past year, but surprised many by asking Jeremy Hunt to take up the portfolio.</p> <p>Hunt has been under relentless Labour attack over his role in News Corporation's attempted takeover of BSkyB, but is rated by Cameron for his ability to focus on a clear political message. His first task will be to resell and amend Lansley's legacy, aided by Grant Shapps, the smooth-talking new Conservative chairman.</p> <p>The removal of Justine Greening as transport secretary, a fierce opponent of a third runway at Heathrow, and her replacement by the former chief whip Patrick McLoughlin also paves the way for a government shift on aviation expansion, probably though a cross-party commission on aviation policy.</p> <p>In a blunt assessment even by Boris Johnson's standards, the London mayor denounced Greening's transfer to international development as madness. He issued a blistering statement praising Greening as \"a first-rate transport secretary\".</p> <p>\"Now it is clear that the government wants to ditch promises and send yet more planes over central London,\" he said.</p> <p>Theresa Villiers, another London MP opposed to the third runway, has also been shipped out of the transport department to take charge of Northern Ireland, a promotion of a woman to cabinet in a reshuffle that overall did little to advance the cause of women in politics.</p> <p>Grayling's appointment also signals a determination by Cameron to take a tougher line on sentencing, the Human Rights Act, legal aid and community punishment, a nexus of policy issues that has left Conservative backbenchers frustrated by what they regarded as Clarke's willingness to pander to Lib Dem opinion.</p> <p>Axing Clarke from the post removes a running sore for the Sun, Telegraph and Mail, even if he remains as a minister without portfolio free to advise on economic policy. It is a move Osborne will view with mixed feelings. Clarke, who rejected an offer to become leader of the Commons, has ensured that he will sit on the key cabinet sub-committee on the economy and on the national security council.</p> <p>One former Labour cabinet minister said: \"This reshuffle represents both Plan A \u2013 Osborne remains as chancellor \u2013 and Plan B \u2013 Ken Clarke as deputy chancellor.\"</p> <p>In practice Clarke has been a deficit hawk, and Tory pro-growth policies will be promoted by Michael Fallon at business, Nicholas Boles at planning and Mark Prisk as housing. But Tory MPs said Osborne had failed to extend his grip over Whitehall in every area. The biggest setback was the refusal of Duncan Smith to relinquish the post of work and pensions secretary, where he has been involved in a series of battles over his welfare reforms.</p> <p>The chancellor was keen to move Duncan Smith because he is fighting a public battle to resist Osborne's plans for a further \u00a310bn in welfare cuts by 2016. Duncan Smith's success raises the prospect of a renewal of his alliance with Nick Clegg, who provided vital support over the funding of his welfare reforms. The deputy prime minister told the Guardian last week that he would only accept some of the extra welfare cuts in return for a wealth tax.</p> <p>But Osborne will see some of his allies in key posts. Michael Fallon, a member of his circle, and Matt Hancock, his former chief of staff, move to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.</p> <p>Downing Street avoided a major setback when Lady Warsi reluctantly accepted a demotion from Tory co-chair to be \"senior minister of state\" at the foreign office.</p> <p>Warsi had planned to refuse the new job after being informed by the prime minister on Monday that she was being demoted. This would have raised questions about Cameron's focus on promoting members of Britain's minority ethnic communities. But in the end Warsi decided to remain on board, after Cameron told her she would remain a key member of the government.</p> <p>Only three cabinet ministers were fired altogether from the government\u2013 Caroline Spelman, Cheryl Gillan, and Sir George Young. Cameron appointed four women from the class of 2010. Liz Truss, one of the most influential thinkers of the new intake, becomes an education minister. Helen Grant, who played a key role in negotiating changes to the legal aid bill to answer concerns among women's groups about domestic violence, becomes a justice minister. Anna Soubry and Esther McVey come in to the health and work and pensions departments respectively.</p> <p>In a move designed to focus Liberal Democrat resources on election-winning domestic issues, Clegg appointed allies David Laws to education, Jeremy Browne to the Home Office and Norman Lamb to health. The Lib Dems vacated both the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence, a move that shocked Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat armed forces minister who had used his base to shape a distinctive policy on Trident.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister enjoys precious few formal powers under a constitution which vests most executive authority in individual secretaries of state. The great exception, and the source of Downing Street's vast effective power, is the prerogative to hire and fire these various secretaries and their underlings. A reshuffle, therefore, is the nearest thing we get to an unalloyed moment of prime ministerial power. And, in the words of Lyndon Johnson biographer Robert Caro, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/10/lyndon-b-johnson-robert-caro-biography\" title=\"\">power always reveals</a>.</p> <p>David Cameron's reshuffle ought to have been doubly revealing because he rose to the top more by shedding old Tory baggage than by spelling out what he believed. And all the more so because he has shrewdly refused to be panicked into premature overhauls before now. After the spin of opposition, the novelty of coalition, and the apprentice premiership, here at last was a chance for the real Mr Cameron to stand up \u2013 whether as a child of Thatcher, or instead as man of the Tory reform tradition, which stretches from Macmillan right back to Disraeli and Peel.</p> <p>But power, like a mirage, appears somewhere else when you get close to it. The prime minister planned to force Iain Duncan Smith to move on from welfare but <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9520271/Iain-Duncan-Smith-rejected-offer-of-Justice-secretary-to-finish-welfare-reform.html\" title=\"\">could not find the voice</a> to give the quiet man his marching orders. He could have moved George Osborne and rewritten a broken economic policy but did not feel he could oust a close friend, with whom he shares a hopelessly pessimistic view of the constraints imposed by government debt. Risky as a move at the Treasury would have been, it was the one reshuffle which our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/27/george-osborne-liability-tories-poll-reveals?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">recent Guardian/ICM poll</a> suggests would have truly interested the voters.</p> <p><strong>An illiberal moment</strong></p> <p>The fact that it was not done guarantees that there will be little chat about the event in bars or barbers' shops; the government's reputation will not immediately alter much in the country. But the changes will \u2013 in time \u2013 bear on the reputation of the prime minister and his government, and not for the better. In opposition and into his early days in power, the novel promise of Mr Cameron was to marry traditional Conservative economics with a liberal, progressive agenda on everything else \u2013 respect for civil liberties, regard for underrepresented groups, rehabilitation over vindictive punishment, a reshaped political system, environmental concern and an ethos of public service. Every one of these noble aims was, to some extent, retardedon Tuesday.</p> <p>One of the first announcements was the replacement of Ken Clarke, a pro-European Tory who has greatly enhanced the liberal case for this government, by Chris Grayling. Where Mr Clarke bravely spelled out measures to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/kenneth-clarke-pledges-cut-prison-population\" title=\"\">arrest the generational tide towards mass incarceration</a>, as shadow home secretary Mr Grayling said he would like to l<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/oct/04/conservative-prison-population-plans\" title=\"\">ock more people up for longer</a>. And where Mr Clarke had been clear that any human rights reform would have to build on the European convention, Mr Grayling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/06/conservatives.humanrights\" title=\"\">once resolved to tear up</a> the Human Rights Act that codifies that very convention. Without the cash for a new jail-building programme, or any conception of how rights could really be ripped up without violating treaty obligations, the grimmest past Grayling rhetoric may remain nasty talk, but the change in direction is chilling.</p> <p>The second stark signal for policy was sent out when the able Justine Greening was shunted out of transport after a matter of months, in a move which \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19475249\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson rudely explained</a> \u2013 was purely to reopen the option of expanding Heathrow. Ms Greening was \u2013 like the old modernising incarnation of Mr Cameron \u2013 bitterly opposed. Many other changes have a less direct read-across to particular policies, but will greatly affect what the Cameroons used to call the aroma. The new environment secretary, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9520174/Owen-Paterson-becomes-new-Environment-Secretary.html\" title=\"\">Owen Paterson</a>, is fiercely pro-shale-gas, anti-fox and reportedly flaky on climate. The promotions for Messrs <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8602371.stm\" title=\"\">Grayling</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/22/tory-minister-opposes-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">Paterson</a> come even though both men have, at different times, been dismissive about the gay rights agenda. There is a net reduction in female representation around the top table, which is also left whiter than before by the ousting of party co-chair Sayeeda Warsi.</p> <p><strong>Unhealthy change</strong></p> <p>The redeployment of Jeremy Hunt to health is the most breathtaking of all, since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/31/editorial-jeremy-hunt-ministerial-irresponsibility\" title=\"\">disgraceful closeness</a> of his office to the Murdochs through the BSkyB saga means he starts out dogged with suspicion when the pressing need in the NHS is to rebuild broken trust. He is known for hugging corporate power close, when the government's mighty challenge is to explain to the professions and the country why its dubious reforms are concerned with the patient, and not commercialisation for its own sake. It is a move which betrays contempt for the electorate, just after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/sep/04/george-osborne-booed-paralympics-video\" title=\"\">the booing of the chancellor</a> from the benign crowd of Paralympic spectators signalled that goodwill is vanishing fast. Tuesday's political drama will soon be forgotten. Its consequences, however, will stir searching questions for the dwindling band of progressives (inside and outside the Liberal Democrats) who have until now given this government the benefit of the doubt.</p>",
  "<p>The Obama campaign's use of sophisticated digital tools designed to oil its ground operation and increase engagement with voters on the doorstep could give the president a one or two point advantage over Mitt Romney in the key battleground states upon which the outcome of the election depends, his campaign manager has predicted.</p> <p>Jim Messina, who heads an army of several hundred staffers that has been working for 18 months to secure Obama's re-election, said that the digital campaign that has been assembled this year to interact with voters is \"light years ahead of where we were in 2008. We're going to make 2008 on the ground look like Jurassic Park\".</p> <p>He also claimed that Democrat's investment in innovations <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/14/obama-digital-campaigning-dashboard\">such as the canvassing tool set Dashboard</a> and a massive database of voters' details <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/17/obama-digital-data-machine-facebook-election \">that interfaces with Facebook</a> had left the Republicans standing.</p> <p>\"The Romney campaign are doing more than the McCain campaign did [in 2008], I want to give them credit for that. But they are nowhere near where we are on the ground,\" Messina told an event at the Democratic National Convention sponsored by ABC News and Yahoo News.</p> <p>He gave examples from two important swing states \u2013 North Carolina where the convention is being held and where the Obama campaign has 50 field offices up and running while the Romney campaign has yet to open its 20th; and Ohio where the disparity on the ground is even greater at 100 Obama offices to Romney's 30.</p> <p>Messina said that a two-point bounce in key swing states such as Florida, Ohio, Iowa and Colorado could be decisive in determining the outcome of the 6 November election. \"This election is going to be very close. We have been building a ground operation that will give us the one or two points that we need to win these states and we are on track to do that.\"</p> <p>Messina's comments on the 2012 election's ground war were unusually direct for the Obama campaign. The Chicago headquarters that is spearheading the effort to re-elect the president normally avoids discussion of its technical operations for fear of giving away trade secrets to the opposition.</p> <p>The Chicago team prides itself with having developed over the past five years, since Obama launched his first bid for the White House in 2007, the most sophisticated digital campaign in global political history. It is centred around a gargantuan unified database of millions of voter files which, through Dashboard, volunteers can access anywhere at any time. That, combined with Facebook and online micro-targetting of specific groups of undecided voters, has allowed the campaign to amplify and extend the traditional door-to-door efforts of volunteers digitally.</p> <p>While Obama has put a large portion of his war chest behind the largest and best oiled ground operation ever seen, Romney and his Super PAC supporters have taken a more conventional approach of blitzing battleground states with largely negative television advertising. The outcome of the presidential race could in part hinge on this fundamental difference \u2013 a modern digital campaign versus a conventional TV one.</p> <p>Ben LaBolt, the Obama campaign's chief spokesman, said that the president had an important advantage over his Republican challenger. Obama took the unprecedented decision at the end of the 2008 race to leave his digital campaign largely intact, redirecting it to help fight battles faced by his administration such as the passage of healthcare reform.</p> <p>That means that he was able to start campaigning for re-election historically early. \"We have been organising in this campaign for 500 days; while the Republicans were out there pummelling each other during the primaries, our supporters were talking to their friends and neighbours about the president's record and vision,\" LaBolt said.</p> <p>While the 2012 digital campaign launched by the Obama team undoubtedly looks slick, many of the claims made for it have so far been unsubstantiated by any solid data. Messina claimed that the campaign has registered 150% more voters and knocked on 147% more doors this year than at this stage in 2008, though whether or not that translates into actual votes cast remains one of the big questions of this presidential election cycle.</p>",
  "<p>Squash 'em! That was the advice I was given on finding a little colony of cabbage white butterfly caterpillars. Many gardeners struggling against weather and weeds to maintain an aesthetic or productivity will be moved to violence when faced with the indolence of \"pests\" freeloading off their lovingly tended plants. There is a kind of moral indignation about wild Nature wriggling out of control and nibbling the precious produce as if it's a premeditated crime.</p> <p>Even now those attitudes jump the garden fence and inflict themselves on the environment. In this case the caterpillars were feeding on garlic mustard, a cabbage relative and therefore the prerogative of cabbage whites. The caterpillars had recently hatched from a cluster of eggs. Bristly, green and yellow like little commuter trains, their shear-like jaws chomped succulent leaf, leaving only a skeleton of veins as if the plant had been zapped by some alien death ray. The caterpillars worked together quickly, efficiently. They seemed so vulnerable \u2013 and slightly frantic, as if they had to get as much food&#xa0;into the wrinkly sleeping bags of their skins before being eaten themselves, or squashed.</p> <p>All this, just to grow, then pupate, then fly away as a butterfly to lay its own eggs. There's a lot about the idea of metamorphosis that we accept on faith. The difference between those gobbling grubs and the paper-white flutterers they will become is astonishing. Perhaps caterpillars and butterflies look so different because they are? That was the fascinating view of biologist Donald Williamson, whose evolutionary theory of hybridogenesis considered butterfly metamorphosis to be a result of larval transfer between velvet worms \u2013 the caterpillars and insects \u2013 and butterflies. Like many good ideas and things that don't fit in, that was squashed too.</p>",
  "<h2>Health <br></h2> <p>Doctors' leaders want new health secretary Jeremy Hunt's arrival to improve relations between the profession and ministers, which became very strained as the coalition pushed through its NHS reforms.</p> <p>\"The appointment of a new health secretary provides a fresh opportunity for doctors and government to work together to improve patient care and deal with the many challenges facing the NHS,\" said Dr Mark Porter, the British Medical Association's chair of council.</p> <p>But Labour questioned Hunt's suitability to be responsible for the NHS, pointing to a row over Hunt allegedly questioning whether the NHS should have taken pride of place in the Olympics opening ceremony. \"Right now the NHS needs somebody who believes in its values and is ready to stand up for it. Instead the prime minister has given it to the man who reportedly tried to remove the NHS tribute from the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games,\" said Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary.</p> <p>They also pointed to Hunt having been one of the Conservative politicians, including serving and future MPs, who were listed as \"co-authors\" of a 2005 book published by the right-of-centre campaign group Direct Democracy which backed \"denationalising\" the NHS. One chapter of the book said that: \"Our ambition should be to break down the barriers between private and public provision, in effect denationalising the provision of healthcare in Britain, so extending to all the choices currently available only to the minority who opt for private care.\"</p> <p>Hunt's exact role in the book, Direct Democracy: An Agenda for a New Model Party, which covered many policy areas, is unclear. \"Co-authors\" also included the education secretary, Michael Gove.</p> <p>But along with the reorganisation of the NHS, efficiency savings and repairing tattered relations between government and the NHS workforce, there was an appeal for Hunt to ask the bigger questions about the future of the health system. \"Top of Mr Hunt's in-tray will be making sure the NHS is financially sustainable for the future and fit to respond to the needs of our changing population\", said Mike Farrar, the organisation's chief executive of the NHS Confederation. <strong>DC</strong></p> <h2>Justice<br></h2> <p>Chris Grayling's appointment as the new justice secretary heralds a new hardline approach. David Cameron had grown exasperated with Kenneth Clarke and his ministerial team for what was regarded as an overly soft approach on law and order. \"We have a rightwinger at the ministry of justice,\" one government source said of Grayling, who will lead a completely new team.</p> <p>Clarke focused on managing the cuts to the prison service and the legal aid budget. Having largely taken the sting out of those two issues, he had recently been focusing on reforming community sentencing, introducing full work for prisoners and reforming the court system.</p> <p>Grayling will regard these as his main priorities too, but he will be more hardline on sentencing than Clarke. But on prisons Grayling will be more liberal than some had assumed. He is a strong supporter of the \"rehabilitation revolution\" and was consulted as shadow home secretary when it was outlined by the Tories in opposition.</p> <p>This is designed to reduce reoffending rates by providing incentives for the voluntary and private sector to find work for ex-offenders. Crispin Blunt, the outgoing prisons minister, was in the process of taking further steps to prepare prisoners for such work outside by increasing the amount of work in prison.</p> <p>Downing Street will be hoping that Grayling will change the government's tone over the European court of human rights. Clarke famously had a public bust-up with Theresa May, the home secretary, at the Tory conference last year when she claimed that a man had avoided deportation by invoking his right to a family life on the grounds that he needed to care for a cat. As a staunch Eurosceptic, Grayling will have no problem agreeing with May.</p> <p>Grayling will have to work with Clarke. The outgoing justice secretary will continue to pilot the justice and security bill through the Commons. <strong>NW</strong></p> <h2>Transport <br></h2> <p>The biggest question facing the new minister is about airport expansion, and especially Heathrow. Patrick McLoughlin \u2013 the ninth transport secretary in six years, but familiar with the territory, as an aviation minister back in the Major government \u2013 is inheriting a row over what to do next: government policy rules out a third runway in this parliament, but the Treasury has indicated it is open to the idea long term. The issue splits the government and backbenches alike. Many take his predecessor Justine Greening's move out of the transport department as a sign the plan is back on the cards \u2013 Greening had been a vocal opponent.</p> <p>There is another unresolved battle over rail, with Virgin currently seeking a judicial review of the West Coast mainline franchise award. If Virgin's legal action is dismissed, McLoughlin will just have to deal with an angry Richard Branson. If not, the consequences could be more far-reaching \u2013 possibly a review of the franchising process, delaying a host of contracts up for renewal in the next two years. He may also push the Treasury to again soften the blow on commuters of planned rail fares, set to rise between 6 and 11% in January.</p> <p>He will have to choose this autumn between the route options for the \u00a333bn high speed rail network north of Birmingham \u2014 a decision with the potential to create new areas of local opposition, particularly in London and the south.</p> <p>Roadbuilding woes lie further off. And for those Jeremy Clarksonites who believe there has been, in last-but-one incumbent Philip Hammond's words, a \"war on the motorist\", there is the promised, totemic raising of the motorway speed limit. But with road deaths climbing, McLoughlin may choose to let this one slip quietly away. <strong>GT</strong></p> <h2>Culture<br></h2> <p>Maria Miller arrives at what was once called the ministry of fun with plenty of work to do. The little-known 48-year-old has only a few weeks before she will be handed a copy of Lord Justice Leveson's conclusions of his inquiry into press standards and ethics \u2013 and will have to contend with public and industry fall out \u2013 even though the decision as to how to respond to Leveson will be taken well above her pay grade.</p> <p>She may also be in the uncomfortable position of being one of the first in government to learn whether Leveson is criticising her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, and front up what is expected to be a governmental decision to respond to calls for press reform by ducking calls for legislation.</p> <p>Her arrival also allows the department to return to normal business after Leveson's examination of Hunt's intensely scrutinised handling of the Murdoch bid for BSkyB \u2013 before the Olympics decision making at DCMS had simply seized up. A communications green paper was abandoned \u2013 a white paper is due at the turn of the year. But Hunt's thought to be quixotic local TV stations project has actually progressed so far now that it is likely to go ahead. There are 51 bidders for licences in 21 towns and cities.</p> <p>Culture is a disparate, complex department with no shortage of potentially emotive issues. Miller has to safeguard the legacy \u2013 or sustainability \u2013 of the Olympics at a time when there is public pressure to see greater participation in sport.The arts sector is contending with the impact of a near 30% funding cuts and she will also have to decide matters more technical too \u2013 whether more public money is needed to ensure broadband speeds maintain pace with other developed countries, and take a decision Hunt was keen to duck: when \u2013 if ever \u2013 it would be necessary to turn off FM radio in favour of digital. <strong>DS</strong></p> <h2>Environment<br></h2> <p>The new environment secretary, Owen Paterson, will be blooded into his new job in dramatic fashion: the start of the highly controversial badger cull in England. Animals will be shot within weeks, barring last-minute legal challenges. The cull aims to curb the scourge of tuberculosis in cattle and Paterson, when shadow environment secretary, wholeheartedly backed the farmers who support the cull.</p> <p>That is the most pressing issue in his in-tray, but the alternating threat of floods and droughts require urgent attention too. That will be tricky given the huge budget cut his predecessor accepted, the biggest of any major department. As a consequence, hundreds of flood defences that were in line for funding have not been built. With climate change increasing flood risk, the environment secretary sits one downpour from disaster.</p> <p>Rising food prices will be a challenge too, but the most important issue Paterson faces is far broader and at the heart of a fierce battle in cabinet: the fate of David Cameron's pledge to make his government the \"greenest ever\".</p> <p>As the economy has tanked, the Tory right has looked to bury that pledge in the name of growth at any cost. The environment secretary has been important \u2013 if not all that effectual in the guise of the sacked Caroline Spelman \u2013 in fighting that idea, for example by producing landmark studies on the value of the natural environment to the UK economy.</p> <p>With strong green voices in decline around the cabinet table, Paterson's key role will be how he uses his new power to argue against \u2013 or for \u2013 anti-environmental policies across government. <strong>DC</strong></p>",
  "<p>This was a reshuffle by the Conservative party for the Conservative party, designed to make the party more at ease with itself, and allow it to be seen as a distinctive right of centre ideological force at the next election.</p> <p>It is not a reshuffle for the coalition, or more cohesive government. In his choices Cameron has shown little deference to Nick Clegg, and instead paid attention to the demands of his parliamentary party. The Rose Garden is now closed until further notice.</p> <p>All five Liberal Democrat cabinet ministers may have been retained in their current posts, but when the quintet look round the table at the first meeting of the cabinet, they will see a constellation of forces ranged against them has strengthened significantly.</p> <p>Indeed some Liberal Democrat MPs privately questioned whether Nick Clegg had bargained as hard as he could in this reshuffle, and whether he allowed too much to pass so long as his chief political prize \u2013 the return of David Laws to government \u2013 was secured.</p> <p>The famous five now confront Owen Paterson at the department of environment, opposed to renewable subsidies and supportive of shale gas. He will face battles ahead with the energy secretary Ed Davey, as well as with Clegg on EU issues such as fisheries.</p> <p>At the Ministry of Justice, instead of the liberal Kenneth Clarke they face Chris Grayling \u2013 \"a man who does not have a liberal bone in his body\" according to one Lib Dem MP .</p> <p>At the Department for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, the former chief whip, may be an agnostic on aviation \u2014 he has a fear of flying \u2013 but he will do Downing Street's broad bidding. In the words of the London Mayor Boris Johnson, Justine Greening can only have been shifted from transport after just 10 months to make way for a new policy on the third runway at Heathrow built round a new all-party commission on the future of aviation.</p> <p>Equalities, a brief previously held in the home office by the Home Secretary Theresa May and the Lib Dem Lynn Featherstone, has been sent to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, one of the few departments in which no Lib Dem minister serves.</p> <p>At the same time it emerged that Vince Cable, the business secretary, was not consulted over the appointment of Matthew Hancock and Michael Fallon in his department. Conservative sources were openly briefing that the two men had in part been appointed to keep a hawkish eye on Cable as the battle hots up over deregulation as the primary route to growth. Fallon was being presented by Downing Street as \"a voice for business\" in the department of business, implying there has not been one there hitherto.</p> <p>The extent to which Vince's wagons are in reality being circled by hostile Tories can be exaggerated. Hancock is an intellectual who can have a serious debate with Cable, and David Willetts the moderate higher education minister remains in place. He has a serious relationship with Cable. But the net effect will be that Cable, and his Lib Dem colleague Jo Swinson in the department, will have to argue their corner that much harder at business to get an agreed policy.</p> <p>It is also strange that Nick Harvey \u2013 the respected Lib Dem armed forces minister \u2013 has been sacked by Clegg, meaning they have vacated the defence department entirely. Harvey's dismissal came out of the blue and has hit him hard since he was intimately involved in drawing up a policy on the replacement for trident nuclear submarine programme due to be published next year.</p> <p>Harvey had good relations with the defence secretary Philip Hammond, but was told by Clegg that he wanted to focus his finite ministerial resources on those departments from which they could get most media traction, and argued it was more important for a green party such as the Liberal Democrats for the first time to have a minister at the department of environment.</p> <p>The stronger counter argument is that with Davey as energy secretary, the Lib Dems' green agenda was well covered, and Harvey was using his base to propose a serious alternative to Trident renewal.</p> <p>Harvey expressed some of his unease, telling the Guardian: \" I hope very much that the absence of a Lib Dem voice in the Ministry of Defence does not make it more difficult to ensure that the review comes up with the options we would like\".</p> <p>Clegg has told Harvey that he will personally oversee the review through the cabinet office where David Laws will also be present. Harvey regarded Trident, and the knowledge base of the ministry of defence, as critical to the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Even the appointment of Jeremy Hunt to the Department of Health is not an unalloyed plus for the Lib Dems. Nick Clegg in an effective vote of no confidence in Hunt's handling of the Rupert Murdoch's bid for BskyB ordered his MPs not to vote against a censure motion tabled by Labour in the Commons. Yet in a sign that Cameron totally disagrees with Clegg's judgement, the prime minister has promoted Hunt to the most politically sensitive public service post in the cabinet.</p> <p>At least Andrew Lansley's departure allows Norman Lamb to return to health, a brief he held with distinction for the Lib Dems in opposition. Lansley barred him from health over a bitter pre-election row the two men had on the future of social care. Lamb's arrival will also allow the Lib Dems to distance themselves from the Lansley reforms, and focus on social care, another hot election issue.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/04/cnn-international-documentary-bahrain-arab-spring-repression\">Today I reported on the refusal of CNN International (CNNi) to broadcast an award-winning documentary, \"iRevolution\"</a>, that was produced in early 2011 as the Arab Spring engulfed the region and which was highly critical of the regime in Bahrain. The documentary, featuring CNN's on-air correspondent Amber Lyon, viscerally documented the brutality and violence the regime was using against its own citizens who were peacefully protesting for democracy. Commenting on why the documentary did not air on CNNi, CNN's spokesman cited \"purely editorial reasons\". </p> <p>Even so, the network's relationships with governments must bear closer examination. CNNi has aggressively pursued a business strategy of extensive, multifaceted financial arrangements between the network and several of the most repressive regimes around the world which the network purports to cover. Its financial dealings with Bahrain are deep and longstanding.</p> <h2>CNNi's pursuit of sponsorship revenue from the world's regimes</h2> <p>CNNi's pursuit of and reliance on revenue from Middle East regimes increased significantly after the 2008 financial crisis, which caused the network to suffer significant losses in corporate sponsorships. It thus pursued all-new, journalistically dubious ways to earn revenue from governments around the world. Bahrain has been one of the most aggressive government exploiters of the opportunities presented by CNNi.</p> <p>These arrangements extend far beyond standard sponsorship agreements for advertising of the type most major media outlets feature. CNNi produces those programs in an arrangement <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/09/world/sponsorships-policy/index.html\">it describes</a> as \"in association with\" the government of a country, and offers regimes the ability to pay for specific programs about their country. These programs are then featured as part of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/eye.on/index.html\">CNNi's so-called \"Eye on\" series</a> (\"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/11/world/europe/eye-on-georgia-wine-embargo/index.html\">Eye on Georgia</a>\", \"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/09/world/asia/ireport-eye-on-philippines/index.html\">Eye on the Phillipines</a>\", \"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/20/world/europe/eye-on-poland-food-chef/index.html\">Eye on Poland</a>\"), or \"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/mme/index.html\">Marketplace Middle East</a>\", all of which is designed to tout the positive economic, social and political features of that country.</p> <p>The disclosure for such arrangements is often barely visible. This year, for instance, CNNi produced an \"Eye on Lebanon\" series, which that <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Business/Lebanon/2012/May-09/172765-cnn-network-to-feature-eye-on-lebanon-for-tourism-promo.ashx#axzz25V2471Ia\">nation's tourist minister boasted</a> was intended \"to market Lebanon as a tourism destination\". He said \"his ministry was planning a large promotional campaign dubbed 'Eye on Lebanon' to feature on CNN network.\" </p> <p>Yet one strains to find the faded, small disclosure print on <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/world/meast/eye-on-lebanon-quiz/index.html\">this \"Eye on Lebanon\" page</a>, even if one is specifically searching for it. To the average viewer unaware of these government sponsorships, it appears to be standard \"reporting\" from the network.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395657057\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346758581463/eyeonlebanon.png\" alt=\"cnn eye on lebanon\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That tiny disclosure provides that \"CNN's Eye On series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile.\" In other instances, such as its <a href=\"http://ireport.cnn.com/topics/800694\">online promotion for \"Eye on Georgia\"</a>, no such disclaimer is provided.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/cnns-effusive-coverage-of-kazakhstan-is-quietly-sponsored-by-its-subject/260149/\">recent critique</a> from the Atlantic's website of the network's \"Eye on Kazakhstan\" series noted that \"there are some unusual things going on with CNN International's Kazakhstan series\" but \"you'd have to know the country pretty well to spot them.\"</p> <p>Specifically, as Myles Smith, a Central Asia-based consultant, <a href=\"http://www.eurasianet.org/node/65688\">reported</a> in a piece entitled \"Kazakhstan: CNN Blurs Line Between News and Advertising\", the program ends with an \"in association\" disclosure that merely shows two unnamed corporate logos: as it turns out, those logos are of agencies of the Kazakh government, though the average viewer would have no way of knowing this. The program also features an expert guest who, undisclosed to the viewer, is an employee of the Kazakh government. As Smith commented:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[T]elevision and internet viewers are left with little indication that the programing isn't news, but rather a flashy infomercial exploiting CNN's waning credibility.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>CNN's \"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/09/world/sponsorships-policy/index.html\">sponsorship policy</a>\", which bears a date after this controversy arose over its rosy-eyed \"Eye On\" program about Kazakhstan, states that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'[P]arts of CNN's coverage beyond the daily news are produced as Special Reports, which attract sponsors who pay to associate their products or services with the editorial content,' but claims that 'at no stage do the sponsors have a say in which stories CNN covers.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Even so, CNNi's editorial conduct toward Bahrain, combined with its aggressive pursuit of money from the regime, raises serious questions about its ability, or desire, to maintain journalistic independence.</p> <h2>CNNi's financial dealings with the regime in Bahrain</h2> <p>At the same time as CNN was covering the regime, Bahrain was an aggressive participant in CNN's various \"sponsorship\" opportunities, with official agencies of the regime often boasting of how their extensive involvement with CNN was improving the nation's image around the world. Beyond that, there are multiple examples of CNN International producing plainly propagandistic coverage of the regime, often without any minimal disclosure of the vested interests of its sources.</p> <p>The primary regime agency exploiting these opportunities at CNNi is the Bahrain Economic Development Board (BEDB). It <a href=\"http://www.bahrainedb.com/m_AboutEDBIntro.aspx\">describes itself</a> as \"responsible for marketing the Kingdom of Bahrain abroad\". The agency is chaired by \"His Royal Highness Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince\".</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/guardian.co.uk/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:YCvGjgQkKvQJ:www.bahrainedb.com/uploadedFiles/Bahraincom/BahrainForBusiness/EDB%2520Annual%2520Report%25202010%2520English.pdf+%22cnn+eye+on+bahrain%22&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi0tvfv9jqCq1zCJtBkzTXV_Y-4MlrawLePgoEGAKi5eoLbw35mDGpo_LXSXHhG5ey41Rdnxenr3Tzh5o-X0OQrsuEyyFIOmC6cUvmW5S4hRCmbvtoShAF9JwxuxLSlbjraV9Ye&amp;sig=AHIEtbSQ8SdVnJEqRaIR0N9FmsSeZoibfA&amp;pli=1\">2010 annual report</a>, the BEDB \u2013 in the section entitled \"Spreading the Word \u2013 at Home and Abroad\" \u2013 proudly touted its extensive involvement with CNN:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395657058\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346758650329/bedb2.png\" alt=\"bahrain cnn\" width=\"374\" height=\"514\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The BEDB also featured an extensive, image-improving advertising campaign on CNN:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395657059\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346758697469/bedb3.png\" alt=\"bahrain cnn\" width=\"344\" height=\"145\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This extensive relationship had been building for many years. A <a href=\"http://mediame.com/news/events/bahrain_economic_development_board_sponsors_cnns_2008_davos_coverage\">2008 article</a> in a journal devoted to media advertisement in the Middle East trumpeted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"CNN International announced that its coverage of the 2008 World Economic Forum in Davos is being exclusively sponsored by the Bahrain Economic Development Board (BEDB) for the second year running.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It quoted Rani R Raad, CNNi's advertising head:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Bahrain is one of the fastest growing economies in the Middle East and World Economic Forum is a natural fit for the BEDB to reach our audience of global opinion formers and influencers.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.ameinfo.com/222277.html\">2010 announcement</a> heralding more BEDB sponsorship of CNN's Davos coverage, including \"exclusive BEDB branding\" on CNN.com's World Economic Forum microsite, Rand stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We're delighted that our partnership with the BEDB remains an enduring and successful one.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As negative news stories of its brutal repression grew in the wake of the Arab Spring, the regime undertook a massive, very well-funded PR campaign to improve its image. Central to that campaign was CNN International.</p> <p>One large contract was <a href=\"http://bahrainwatch.org/pr/mc-saatchi.html\">with the advertising giant M&amp;C Saatchi</a>. As Bahrain Watch documents, \"around the same time that the Arab Spring protests began in Bahrain in February 2011, M&amp;C Saatchi was awarded a contract by the Bahrain International Circuit to advertise the 2011 Formula 1 race,\" and was then \"awarded a five-year contract worth BD 5.5m (US$14,575,000) by the Economic Development Board\" to \"develop and implement a comprehensive media and promotional plan\" for Bahrain. As Bahrain Watch notes, a new contract with Bahrain's ministry of culture resulted in this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395657060\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346758863380/satchi.png\" alt=\"satchi Bahrain cnn\" width=\"460\" height=\"37\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>And as noted in the accompanying article on Lyon and CNNi's refusal to broadcast the \"iRevolution\" documentary, at least one of the largest PR firms working for the regime, Qorvis Communications, voiced complaints to CNNi about its negative coverage of the regime.</p> <h2>CNNi's merger of advertisement and news for Bahrain</h2> <p>The regime in Bahrain often openly trumpets the hagiographical treatment it receives from CNNi. In 2010, BEDB's <a href=\"http://www.bahrainedb.com/CNN-Bahrain-videos.aspx\">website gushed</a> about CNNi's \"Eye on Bahrain\" series, which had been re-branded as CNN i-List Bahrain. \"Between the 8th and the 12th of March 2010, CNN's Richard Quest with John Defterios \u2013 Quest Means Business show was broadcast live from Bahrain,\" the BEDB wrote. The regime agency described the CNNi show as thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[A] comprehensive review of Bahrain's economy and future direction was presented through a series of interviews with various ministers, sector specialists and more.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The BEDB page touting the show features several incredibly supine interviews by CNNi of various Bahraini officials,<a href=\"http://www.bahrainedb.com/overlay-video.aspx?id=3351\"> including its crown prince</a>. It features a CNNi segment on the <a href=\"http://www.bahrainedb.com/overlay-video.aspx?id=3352\">status of Bahrain as a close and loyal US ally</a>. Still <a href=\"http://www.bahrainedb.com/overlay-video.aspx?id=3353\">another segment</a> hailed the kindgom's \"established legal framework\" as the key to avoiding the worst damage of the financial crisis. </p> <p>To describe the entire program as a massive, blatant propaganda show for the regime is to understate the case. Indeed, as noted above, the BEDB itself described the program as \"a joint cooperation between CNN and\" itself. CNNi's promotion of the program, which contains no disclosure whatsoever of the involvement of the regime in its funding and sponsorship, conveys exactly the tone and substance of this \"reporting\":</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2yVm8p95gww?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2yVm8p95gww\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>This type of fawning coverage of the regime has been standard course for CNN for years. In 2008, CNN's John Defterios, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/mme/blog/labels/Crown%20Prince%20Sheikh%20Salman%20bin%20Hamad%20al-Khalifa.html\">on his \"Marketplace Middle East\" blog</a>, heaped praise on the crown prince. Of his first time in the prince's presence, he wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A big smile and warm greeting clearly mask the undertaking within the court of the crown prince to complete an economic and political reform process.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Defterios hailed the Bahraini prince as a reformer who believes \"there was too much resistance to change.\" His Marketplace show has featured <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2009/BUSINESS/12/10/show.december11/index.html\">wholly sycophantic interviews</a> with the CEO of the BEDB.</p> <p>CNN's efforts on behalf of the regime often violate the most basic precepts of journalistic disclosure obligations, sometimes in ways that are shocking even to the cynical eye. Just two weeks ago, on the website for Fareed Zakaria's program, CNN <a href=\"http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/15/can-u-s-exploit-middle-east-green-energy-potential/?iref=allsearch\">featured an article</a> by Rob Sobhani touting all of the \"innovative\" green energy policies Bahrain is pursuing. This is all designed, Sobhani wrote, \"to make Bahrain a global leader in combating climate change and global warming\". Indeed, he said, \"both issues are personally important to King Hamad.\"</p> <p>Who is Sobhani? The most recent CNN article heralding Bahrain's energy policies identifies him only as \"president of Caspian Group Holdings, which has interests in green energy and infrastructure projects, and author of 'King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia: A Leader of Consequence'\". (His book on the House of Saud is every bit as sycophantic as the title suggests. Sobhani's own company <a href=\"http://www.caspiangroup.com/index.php/caspian-press/\">itself says</a> the book \"should be of value to those seeking to learn more about Saudi Arabia and its visionary king\"; unsurprisingly, in his CNN article on Bahrain, he managed to work in praise for Saudi energy policies as well).</p> <p>But there is much more to Sobhani than that. In <a href=\"http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/19/what-the-kings-of-saudi-arabia-and-bahrain-are-thinking/\">a 2011 article</a> also published by CNN on Zakaria's site, Sobhani purported to describe \"what the Kings of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are thinking\".</p> <p>Roughly two weeks after Lyon and her crew returned from Bahrain having witnessed pervasive brutality from the regime, Sobhani assured CNN readers in that article:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I've met with the King of Bahrain on numerous occasions. This is a man who wants reform \u2026 When he talks about reform, he really means it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As usual, he also had very kind words for the Saudi rulers:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The King is an environmentalist. If I was President Obama, I would say, 'King Abdullah, let's partner together on the environment.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The disclosure line about Sobhani on that 2011 article is telling. After noting that his company is \"a group with interests in energy and infrastructure projects\", it added that \"he engages extensively with the Kings of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia for work.\" In other words, CNN's 2011 expert on what the Saudi and Bahraini regimes are thinking is someone who has extensive business interests with those two regimes.</p> <p>But at least, in 2011, it disclosed this glaring conflict of interest. By contrast, in 2012, when it gave Sobhani a platform to hype the deep and profound concern for global warming on the part of the Bahraini King, there was no such disclosure. One would have thought that Sobhani was simply an objective expert in the region who happened to be deeply impressed with the sensitive energy policies of these Gulf regimes.</p> <p>At times, CNN International does not even bother with any pretense. In 2010, it <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/international/2010/03/15/wv.bahrain.defence.bk.c.cnn\">directly broadcast a report</a> straight from Bahraini state television glorifying a military parade held in the Kingdom. Although a quick disclaimer at the start of the segment indicated that the report was \"not prepared by CNN journalists\", it bore the CNN logo the entire time it was shown, and had no critical commentary or challenge from anyone. It simply heralded the greatness and nobility of the Bahrain military and the regime that operates it.</p> <p>For programs CNNi produces in \"association with\" these regimes, even the minimal disclosure it provides often ends up omitted. As one former CNN producer explained, budget pressures mean that segments from the \"paid for\" programs about these countries sometimes end up being spliced into news reports with no disclosure that the regimes sponsored their production. The line at CNNi between news and advertising is severely blurred by these arrangements, but the line only gets blurrier as its executives expand the scope of these income-generating opportunities in partnership with the world's most repressive regimes.</p> <h2>CNNi's corporate template of 'beige safety'</h2> <p>When it comes to CNNi's reporting on the region, it seems that there are more than just financial arrangements creating serious conflicts of interest. That Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are very close allies of the US government seems to ensure that their regime's complaints about news coverage are \u2013 as noted in the accompanying article \u2013 given far more deference than, say, complaints from US enemies in the region such as Iran or Syria.</p> <p>Then, there's CNN's corporate disposition to avoid reporting that would be deemed controversial, especially among the world's key power centers. In an interview this week about CNNi, NYU journalism Professor Jay Rosen said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"When people think about CNN as a news operation, they naturally start with the CNN that they see. But if you want to understand CNN as a force in news and the global flow of the news, you have to start with what CNN is \u2013 not on your television set, but on all the sets on the world where it plays, because that's the economic logic of the network \u2026</p> <p>\"What CNN as a company, or as a media empire is, is this international network that somehow gets accepted as this sort of professional, neutral, standard, baseline news service in a wide variety of markets from ruling family transactions to signing up cable partners and airports and hotel chains.</p> <p>\"So the real business is in that: making CNN this kind of colorless brand of news, that every hotel chain, cable provider, and government around the world can see as safe \u2026 The logic of the company is to be a consensus news product in the broadest sense of the term, so that I always compare it to the use of beige in offices and airport terminals. It's that kind of logic. So Beige News is its own genre. 'Safety First' is their key test.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But \"beige safety\", though masquerading as a neutrality, is anything but. \"Stability is its own perspective on international events,\" said Professor Rosen. \"If your primary goal is stability, that's like an ideology. It's the same thing.\" In the case of CNNi, that ideology, grounded in business imperatives, can manifest in support even for the most repressive regimes, simply by shying away from truly cutting-edge and significant reporting.</p> <p>Moreover, CNN's business template, says Professor Rosen, creates multiple serious conflicts for an ostensible news outlet in its coverage:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The value of what CNN is trying to do to be this consensus news product around the world \u2013 not just in the western economic club but around the world \u2013 has many serious consequences. One of the consequences is that it puts you into business with ruling regimes in order to get on the air. Of course, there's a relationship between what you broadcast, what you put out as news, and the likelihood of getting accepted by regimes.</p> <p>\"The nature of this business leads directly to harmlessness in news. That's the way to understand CNN.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>CNN rejects the charge that its journalism is being corrupted. As its spokesman stated to me:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"CNN International has a proud record of courageous, independent and honest reporting from around the world. Any suggestion that the network's relationship with any country has influenced our reporting is wholly and demonstrably wrong.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>For her part, Amber Lyon insists that CNN journalists and producers complained relentlessly about the type of business-driven censorship she now vocally claims was prevalent at CNN. Back in 2004, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/apr/01/bbc.israel\">Guardian's Chris McGreal reported</a> on the network's Middle East bureau:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"CNN sources say the network has bowed to considerable pressure on its editors. Israeli officials boast that they now have only to call a number at the network's headquarters in Atlanta to pull any story they do not like.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Lyon insists that few are willing to speak out due to fear that they will immediately be viewed as a troublemaker and made radioactive to future news employers. Several former CNN employees echoed Lyon's experiences and complaints, but nobody other than her would speak on the record.</p> <p>Highlighting this dynamic of self-censorship among journalists was <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2008/05/29/yellin/\">one incident several years ago</a> involving a CNN reporter, Jessica Yellin. In a clearly unscripted moment, Yellin told CNN's Anderson Cooper on-air that when she had worked at MSNBC executives there had forced her to change her war reporting to reflect more positively on the US and the Bush administration. When her comments led to controversy, Yellin \u2013 by then CNN's congressional correspondent \u2013 immediately <a href=\"http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2008/05/29/tv-news-under-the-microscope/\">walked them back</a>.</p> <p>As to why Lyon has decided to disregard careerist fears, despite still being only in her 20s, she said that she hopes her act of speaking out about what she witnessed inside CNNi will lead to other journalists to do the same:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I want to encourage mainstream journalists to speak up when they discover their companies are misleading the people, doing PR for corporations and governments and disguising it as journalism. Many journalists get into this business, for low pay and grueling hours, because they genuinely want to make a difference, expose injustice. But what's the point if the elephant in the room is the conduct of own company, and you ignore it?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Revealingly, Lyon's purest and perhaps bravest act of journalism became possible only once she had left CNN.</p>",
  "<p>Dallas sneaked into our house, almost literally by&#xa0;the back door. Our babysitter Petra, the oldest daughter of our neighbours, would hop over the garden wall to look after us when Mum went out to work \u2013 and she was addicted to the oil-soaked, Stetson-studded saga of the Ewing family. Before her first month's employment was out, so were my sister and I. If it was a guilty pleasure for us, well, so it was with the rest of the nation.</p> <p>Britain had its own soap operas, of course, but they were either as down-to-earth as we could make them (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/coronation-street\" title=\"\">Coronation Street</a> set the trend, beginning in 1960 as a portrait of a working-class street in an age of transition and still staying fairly true to its gritty roots in the late 1970s when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/feb/04/nancy-banks-smith-classic-reviews\" title=\"\">Dallas</a> turned up), or they were unutterable rubbish done on the cheap by a pool of typing monkeys, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/nov/27/crossroads-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Crossroads</a>, the saga of a&#xa0;Birmingham motel.</p> <p>But Dallas was different. Dallas had buckets of money, on and off screen, and buckets of melodrama. It had glitz, glamour and it revelled in excess. Instead of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgSQcY3Fb8\" title=\"\">Ena Sharples</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAsaAWnscog\" title=\"\">Martha Longhurst</a> eking out port and lemons in&#xa0;the Rover's snug, it had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7tvVGBs1fU\" title=\"\">Sue Ellen</a> knocking back whiskey in the face of her husband JR's endless evil. Instead of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3p8FjbdKTU\" title=\"\">Elsie Tanner</a> in a too-tight skirt, it had everybody in satin-sheeted beds with everybody else (by 1985, there must have been more chlamydia than oil in them thar fields). Instead of Albert Tatlock acting mardy with over-educated nephew-in-law Ken Barlow, it had blood feuds, blackmail and backstabbings galore between the Ewings and Barnes families and their billions and billions of oil dollars.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/clive-james\" title=\"\">Clive James</a>, the Observer's TV critic at the time, called it: \"Every American soap opera you have ever seen rolled into one and given an unlimited charge account at Neiman Marcus.\" The average Brit had never seen any other US soap opera, didn't know what a charge account was, and drew a total blank on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/oct/19/neiman-marcus-plane-christmas-catalogue\" title=\"\">Neiman Marcus</a>, too, but that was all part of the fun.</p> <p>Above all, of course, Dallas had the 1980s. Has there ever been a show that so perfectly encapsulated and encouraged an era? Oil and money were king, and the good guys \u2013 like Bobby \"Baaahbeee!\" Ewing and his saintly wife Pam \u2013 were left for dust by the bad. No antihero has ever been more adored than JR, as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GlWejfJhgo\" title=\"\">\"Who shot JR?\"</a> global furore proved. The arrival of the \"reveal\" episodes under escort at Heathrow made the BBC news. It turned out to be his ex-lover/wife's sister (no one ever had just one role in Dallas). Her name was Kristin which, by some curious collective mental quirk, no one ever remembers without effort.</p> <p>And now it's back. The new series of the show can be thought of as Dallas: The Next Generation, as it ostensibly centres around the still-feuding offspring of the original Ewings: John Ross Junior, who is drilling for oil on the hallowed turf of Southfork itself; Bobby and Pam's adopted son, Christopher, a fan of renewable energy and of not drilling for any oil anywhere; and of course their wives. But \u2013 BUT! \u2013 the real story is that the holy trinity of JR, Sue Ellen and Bobby is back. Twenty years on, Bobby is now the paterfamilias sitting at the head of what is still the billionaire ranch-owners' only dinner table, married not to Pam (who was left terminally ill when the show ended in 1991 and, unless of course the whole thing turns out to be a dream, is now alas no longer with us), but to Ann (played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/mar/18/desperate-housewives-voiceover-narration\" title=\"\">Brenda Strong</a>, AKA the dead one from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/10/euan-ferguson-farewell-desperate-housewives\" title=\"\">Desperate Housewives</a>).</p> <p>Bobby is determined to honour Miss Ellie's dying wish not to allow drilling on Southfork; he is also harbouring A Deadly Secret.

  "<p>MegaFon, Russia's second-largest mobile phone operator, is seeking permission for a \u00a32.5bn float in London, the world's biggest since Facebook listed in New York in May.</p> <p>Russia's richest man, Alisher Usmanov, who took control of the company in April, is reported to have asked the local regulator for permission for the flotation, which could be launched within three or four weeks.</p> <p>That would give investors the chance to buy into a firm that has positioned itself aggressively for the rollout of high-speed mobile data services loved by smartphone-toting urban Russians, and which is backed by the impeccable Kremlin connections of Usmanov, the Arsenal FC shareholder whose fortune is estimated by Forbes magazine at $18.1bn (\u00a311.4bn).</p> <p>Russia is one of the world's busiest mobile phone markets, with the third-highest penetration in the world behind the United Arab Emirates and Panama. The country's 227m mobile subscriptions cover over 150% of the population because almost all of the 144 million inhabitants have a mobile phone, with many owning more than one working SIM card. Megafon has 63m subcriptions.</p> <p>MegaFon has requested permission from Russia's financial markets regulator to list up to 123m shares abroad, equivalent to 19.9% of the company, according to Reuters. \"We are considering the possibility of holding an IPO,\" MegaFon said in response to questions from the news agency. \"The timing of the public offering will depend on market conditions.\"</p> <p>The float will see Teliasonera, the Swedish carrier, reduce its stake in Megafon to 25.1%.</p> <p>Competition is fierce in Russia among the three main networks - MTS, Megafon and Vimpelcom - with MTS having about 70m subscriptions and Vimpelcom 56m. Five other networks have around 38m subscriptions between them.</p> <p>Investors will be keen to buy a slice of the fast-growing company, analysts said, which comes as the mobile operators jostle for position in the race to sell 4G (fourth-generation) mobile services to the public.</p> <p>In July, Usmanov increased his influence in Russia's telecoms sector by combining his MegaFon stake into a holding company he controls that will own state-backed next-generation operator Scartel.</p> <p>The same month MegaFon was one of four companies to win a 4G licence, allowing it to provide superfast wireless internet using the LTE service, which is expected to become the global industry standard. In May it had used Scartel's network to launch LTE services in Moscow.</p> <p>\"MegaFon looks attractive because it is the leader on the Russian mobile internet market,\" Sergei Libin, Moscow-based analyst at Raiffeisen.</p> <p>\"MegaFon's IPO is likely to be one of the few positive Russian stories due to the combination of healthy business growth and good corporate governance,\" said Tibor Bokor, a London-based analyst at ING.</p> <p>It would be the largest IPO by a Russian company since state bank VTB raised $8bn in 2007. Notable Russian IPOs since include aluminium group Rusal's $2.2bn listing in Hong Kong in 2010 and internet search engine Yandex's $1.4bn float on the US Nasdaq exchange in May 2011.</p> <p>Waiting in the wings is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, after forecast-beating quarterly results last week raised the likelihood that the often-delayed sale of a 7.6% state holding worth $5bn would go ahead.</p> <p>Mid-sized lender Promsvyazbank has also sought clearance from the regulator to float up to 25% in London in a deal managers have said could raise $1bn.</p> <p>A MegaFon IPO would be a defining deal for Usmanov, an Uzbek-born metals and mining magnate who has shown a deft touch as a tech investor and made 10 times his money investing in Facebook stock three years before it listed.</p> <p>But the enthusiasm for new technology offerings may have been dimmed by the dismal performance of Facebook shares after its $16bn offering: the shares floated at $38 but are now trading below $18, even while global stock markets have drifted higher through the summer.</p> <p>One source close to the deal said a launch of the IPO is probably three to four weeks away. MegaFon CEO Ivan Tavrin signalled in June that an IPO was some way off due to difficult market conditions.</p> <p>Sources have previously said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley had been appointed to lead the IPO. Other banks including Sberbank, Citi, Credit Suisse and VTB are also involved, sources and Reuters publication IFR have said.</p> <p>Megafon is also in negotiations to buy a stake in Russian mobile phone retailer Euroset, Reuters said. Euroset co-owner Alexander Mamut has been looking to sell his 50.1% stake since last December.</p> <p>MegaFon is majority owned by Usmanov's AF Telecom, which holds 50% plus one share of the company, while 35.6% is owned by Teliasonera, and 14.4% is held by the company as treasury stock.</p> <p>Teliasonera spokesman Thomas Jonsson confirmed that preparations for the MegaFon float were continuing but declined to elaborate.</p> <p>Analysts said valuation was more important than timing to TeliaSonera.</p> <p>\"Telia has been saying that it is dependent on market conditions and they are not particularly happy with the peer-group multiples of Russian assets as things stand,\" said James Britton, an analyst at Nomura Securities in London.</p> <p>\"Our view is that we certainly expect there to be some delay,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Around a third of young children in southern Afghanistan are acutely malnourished, with a level of deprivation similar to that found in famine zones, a government survey has found, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid that has been poured into the region.</p> <p>Around a million Afghans under five are acutely malnourished, according to the UN-backed survey. By far the worst affected area is the southern region \u2013 centred around Kandahar and Helmand \u2013 that was the Taliban's birthplace and has seen some of the heaviest fighting of the decade-long war.</p> <p>\"What's shocking is that this is really very high by global standards,\" said Michael Keating, deputy head of the UN mission in Afghanistan. \"This is the kind of malnutrition you associate with Africa and some of the most deprived parts of the world, not with an area that has received so much international attention and assistance.\"</p> <p>The Afghanistan Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) found 29.5% of children are suffering from acute malnutrition there. A level of more than 30% among young children is considered one sign of a famine.</p> <p>The data does not mean there is a famine in the south. Under UN guidelines, child malnutrition is just one of several criteria used to decide if an area is suffering a famine; others include death rates and families' access to food.</p> <p>Southern Afghanistan has adequate food supplies, experts say, but a serious problem with nutrition. Some families are too poor to buy supplies while others have little education about how to nourish their children; common illnesses like diarrhoea also sap children's strength.</p> <p>A major problem is attitudes to breast feeding, according to UN nutrition specialist Elham Monsef. Women are often told breast milk is not good enough or find it hard to nurse, so infants are given everything from tea and water, which have no nutritional value, to formula milk that is over-diluted or made with dirty water.</p> <p>Basic health measures now common in most developing countries, such as enriching flour and putting iodine in salt to ensure healthy brain development, are not universal in Afghanistan.</p> <p>On a paediatric ward at Mirwais hospital in Kandahar city children admitted for therapeutic feeding were visibly wasted, with saggy skin, protruding bones and no energy; at least one had the disease kwashiorkor, caused by lack of protein.</p> <p>On a recent visit the hospital was packed with desperate mothers such as Fatima, who had travelled from the violent Helmand district of Sangin to seek help for her 18-month-old son, Saddam. At 4.4kg, he weighed the same as some newborns in the UK, and lay listlessly on a greying bedsheet he shared with another patient, his older sister and three women.</p> <p>Poverty has left Fatima helpless in the face of her son's suffering. \"I cannot produce mother's milk, but we are not able to buy food or powdered milk,\" she said. \"My youngest child died from this.\"</p> <p>Aid workers admit that although Afghanistan is well known to have chronic malnutrition problems, evidence of an extreme nutrition crisis caught them by surprise. \"The numbers are just too serious to ignore,\" said Aidan O'Leary, head of the UN office that co-ordinates the humanitarian response to crises in Afghanistan. \"It's very clear that the nutrition response as a whole has to be ramped up.\" He added: \"This is not a one-off survey, this is a global survey conducted in conjunction with the central statistics office.\"</p> <p>The last such survey was conducted in 2004 and although there has been a rapid escalation of the conflict since then, there has also been a huge increase in aid spending. USAID has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into southern Afghanistan, while the UK earmarked tens of millions more for development work in Helmand.</p> <p>The UN and aid groups are now racing to gather more details on the scale of the problem, and worst-hit locations.</p> <p>In a sign of how severe the problem is, experts warn that the crowded wards tackling malnutrition in provincial centres help only a tiny portion of families affected. \"Our focus is on the acute cases, but we need to do more community outreach to prevent it,\" said Vidhya Ganesh, deputy head of Unicef in Afghanistan. \"The major challenge for us is that therapeutic feeding (in hopsital) presents only the tip of the problem.\"</p> <p>Maraz Gul was in the Mirwais hospital with her five-month-old baby Assadullah, who has the loose skin of an old man and wailed listlessly but non-stop as his mother talked. \"I was feeding him breast milk but I couldn't provide enough, and could not afford the formula,\" she said.</p> <p>They had endured a jolting four-hour journey from their village of Rorabad, along roads sometimes seeded with Taliban bombs, but still Maraz Gul considers herself relatively lucky compared with neighbours whose children are also wasting away.</p> <p>\"People in the village with this problem do not come to the hospital, they are poor women and they can't afford to pay for the vehicle,\" she said. \"We sold a sheep to cover the cost.\"</p>",
  "<p>Stoke City are anxiously waiting to learn whether the Premier League will approve Michael Owen's signing and his inclusion in their 25-man squad list after a frantic day of negotiations at the Britannia Stadium. Owen agreed a one-year deal late on Tuesday afternoon but Stoke still have two hurdles to overcome before they can formally announce that he has signed that deal and is free to play for the club this month.</p> <p>The Premier League board has to run through a series of checks when any player is signed outside the transfer window, primarily to establish that his contract had expired with his previous club. Although there is no reason to believe that this will be a problem \u2013 Owen was released by Manchester United in the summer \u2013 the Premier League has not had time to look at Owen's paperwork because of how late the deal was completed.</p> <p>The additional and far more serious complication is that Premier League squad lists had to be submitted by 4pm on Tuesday and it is unclear whether Stoke met that deadline in time to include Owen's name. Although free agents can be signed outside the deadline, as was the case when Aston Villa brought in Robert Pires two seasons ago, clubs looking to do so need to have spaces in their squad and are prohibited from leaving out senior players to achieve that. Stoke, unlike Villa at that time, have a large number of senior players on their books.</p> <p>The Owen situation meant that the Premier League on Tuesday night released squad lists for every club with the exception of Stoke. \"The Premier League Board is currently considering an application from Stoke City to register a player and, subsequently, their squad list will be confirmed at a later date,\" the league said.</p> <p>Stoke remain hopeful that they will get the green light from the Premier League to enable them to announce a signing that will represent quite a coup for them in terms of Owen's profile. He has agreed to move to the Britannia Stadium after accepting a financial package that is essentially a pay-as-you-play deal, whereby he receives a basic wage and significant bonuses, depending on appearances and goals, on top.</p> <p>Owen tweeted last night: \"Delighted to have signed for Stoke subject to Premier League approval. We have been in talks for a while and it was a club I was always keen on.\" Later he added: \"I'm particularly excited at prospect of working under Tony Pulis. He has assembled a great squad that I look forward to joining.\"</p> <p>It looked as though the deal had collapsed at one stage because of a failure to reach an agreement over the financial terms. Stoke were adamant that they would not improve their offer, which is similar to the one that they made two years ago to Jonathan Woodgate, who joined them on a heavily incentivised deal because of his poor injury record.</p> <p>Owen, however, came back to the negotiating table later in the day in a move that will be viewed by some as evidence of the limited options available to a player who was once the most sought-after striker in English football. Though a return to Liverpool had been mooted, Brendan Rodgers had no intention of signing Owen to bolster his threadbare attack and there was little other Premier League interest.</p> <p>Backed into a corner, Owen appears to have accepted that the Stoke deal was as good as it was going to get for him at this stage of his career.</p> <p>He has started only 54 league games since the beginning of the 2006-07 campaign and, although that statistic is partly explained by the difficulties he had getting into the Manchester United team during his three years at Old Trafford, injuries have also taken their toll. He has not started a Premier League game since October 2010 and the last time he played in a competitive match was in the Champions League against Otelul Galati last November. It was 12 months ago, against Stoke, when he last made a Premier League appearance.</p> <p>Stoke, however, are excited about the prospect of Owen joining. Peter Coates, the club's chairman, said: \"We sent the forms off and the deadline was a bit of a rush. We are very pleased. Michael is a good guy and a natural goalscorer. He is also a very proud guy. He might feel he's been written off. I think he might have a point to prove.</p>",
  "<p>I recently took a trip through the Moors, en route to Whitby. The train from Middlesbrough meandered through miles of lavish Yorkshire countryside, stopping at tiny hamlets like <a href=\"http://www.eskvalleyrailway.co.uk/stations/castletonmoor.html\" title=\"\">Castleton Moor</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.eskvalleyrailway.co.uk/stations/ruswarp.html\" title=\"\">Ruswarp</a>.</p> <p>It was positively barbaric. Yes, the cottages are beautiful, but try getting a signal on your mobile. And if you do get a signal, try ordering a delivery from Ocado. This isn't entirely metropolitan snobbery. Whitby, a grand seaside town, is also the only town I've visited where \"golliwogs\" can still be won in arcade games.</p> <p>Now they want to dig up this achingly lush landscape for some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash\" title=\"\">potash</a>, a fertiliser ingredient. Imagine my sorrow. Sarcasm aside, the 11 local organisations now <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-16635060\" title=\"\">opposing</a> this development have a real grievance. This will be one of the biggest mines of its kind in the world, and will despoil 4.5 hectares of the 100 hectares of forestry already owned by York Potash, a subsidiary of the mineral mining company Sirius. The landscape is not only of aesthetic value, but also provides carbon storage, biodiversity and forms a natural flood defence, all of which are difficult to put a cash value on.</p> <p>Sirius promises that any negative effects will be outweighed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/03/potash-mine-north-york-moors?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">by the creation of 1,000 new jobs</a>. This is always the fastest route to the moral high ground for mining and development capital. Thus, some of the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/9517285/Siriuss-UK-potash-mine-plan-that-will-create-1000-jobs-blasted-by-environmental-campaigners.html\" title=\"\">opposition</a> from environmental campaigners hinges on the prospective damage to the economy, particularly tourism. But this merely highlights the false nature of the dilemma \u2013 growth versus sustainability\u2013 posed by mining interests.</p> <p>The real underlying issue in this, as in most controversies related to the exploitation of natural resources, is democracy. As George Monbiot has <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2012/08/02/dance-with-the-one-who-brung-you/\" title=\"\">argued</a>: \"The first prerequisite for protecting the environment is a functioning democracy.\" Whether it is in Brazil, India, Canada, or Britain, the struggles that take place are invariably over who gets the final say in what is done with the planet's wealth.</p> <p>Take, for example, the Rio Tinto potash mine in Mendoza, Argentina, which was <a href=\"http://www.europamines.net/195-argentina-mining-mendozas-turn.html\" title=\"\">approved</a> last month. Opposition centred on potential environmental damage and the creation of salt waste deposits that would pollute the drinking water. Rio Tinto was not trusted by locals to keep the area safe and clean. In addition, the opposition felt that they should have a say in how the country's resources were exploited. This <a href=\"http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/d2a23ad2d50cb2a280256eb300385855/5eb03ffbdd19ea90c1257664004831bd/$FILE/MartinezAlier.pdf\" title=\"\">environmentalism of the poor</a> is sometimes erroneously called \"resource nationalism\": it is just a matter of democracy.</p> <p>On the face of it, mining in the Moors is a different proposition. The major objection is that it's taking place in a national park, conserved for the benefit of the public: a blot on a beautiful landscape. Surely the opposition is conservative and romantic? But taken as part of the government's wider strategy for development we can see that similar issues are at stake.</p> <p>This government is engaged in a hasty retreat from environmental commitments regarding regional development. The potash development follows the abolition of the Regional Spatial Strategies inherited from the last government that, while foregrounding industrial development, included targets for the reduction of greenhouse gases and the development of sustainable industry.</p> <p>Furthermore, the government is intent on handing more leverage to business in how development takes place. Regional development agencies funded by central government were disbanded in this government's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/afua-hirsch-law-blog/2010/nov/09/lords-quangos\" title=\"\">Public Bodies Bill</a> as part of a wider offensive against the public sector. The bill also included a plan to sell off the national forests to private developers, a controversial proposal abandoned at the last minute. These agencies have been replaced by local enterprise partnerships, which are not funded by central government but involve voluntary relationships between local governments and businesses.</p> <p>As a result, local authorities wishing to generate income and encourage development must subordinate everything to creating a convivial environment for investors. The York and North Yorkshire Local Enterprise Partnership naturally makes the potash extraction industry a central component of its growth strategy. You can hardly blame them \u2013 there aren't many other opportunities coming in areas, particularly Scarborough and Whitby, hit hard by spending cuts.</p> <p>So, here is the problem. Two major developments of neoliberalism obstruct environmental justice. First, neoliberal reform has been hollowing out what little democracy parliament affords us, the shift from quangos to voluntary coalitions between government and capital merely confirming popular exclusion from decision-making. Second, when the economy provides few investment opportunities, neoliberalism offers \"accumulation by dispossession\"; turning over previously public goods, whether hospitals or park land, to private profit. This can always be presented as \"creating jobs\".</p> <p>The only answer to this is to assert popular sovereignty over the environment. On that account alone, it would be a step forward if Yorkshire residents stopped the potash mine.</p>",
  "<p>Social and personal psychologists typically list a handful of key actions that can help improve personal wellbeing but would they really stand up to being tested for planet friendliness too?</p> <p>One of the most respected of such lists is the government's <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/five-ways-well-being-evidence\" title=\"\">Five ways to wellbeing</a> which came out of research co-ordinated by the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/\" title=\"\">New Economics foundation</a>, as part of the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight\" title=\"\">Foresight report</a>. The five actions are: </p> <p>1. connect (with people, not technology)<br>2. be active<br>3. take notice <br>4. keep learning<br>5. give</p> <h2>Connect</h2> <p>When we have good relationships with people, we frequently end up sharing resources such as houses, meals or lifts. A house that keeps four people warm rather than one, or an oven that cooks a meal for a group, uses significantly less energy per person. What is more, the connected person is likely to be healthier and use up fewer resources from the health service, the emergency services and social security.</p> <p>\"The evidence is absolutely clear,\" says Felicia Huppert, director of the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridgewellbeing.org%2F&amp;ei=st5FUNXyGOr80QWslYCICw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLFnukYBxVuWb734O1xcAKo1B33g\" title=\"\">Wellbeing Institute</a> at Cambridge University, and a contributor to the Foresight report, \"that social isolation increases ill health and death rates.\"</p> <h2>Be active</h2> <p>Of the five actions, this is the one most obviously linked to greener behaviour: being active and exercising will mean you are more likely to walk or cycle than drive. So while your footprints on the pavement and health will increase, the footprint that matters for the environment - your carbon footprint - will reduce.</p> <p>\"Research has now shown it's not that exercise is an anti-depressant, but more that not being active makes us depressed because we are evolved to be active,\" says Huppert.</p> <p>Being active also helps you connect: those who live in more walkable neighbourhoods in, say, Galway, Ireland, are much more likely than those in car-dependent suburbs to know their neighbours and to trust others. (And, astonishingly, having a sense of community provides more sense of wellbeing than the effect of trebling household income.)</p> <h2>Take notice</h2> <p>We all benefit from stopping for a moment to take notice \u2013 both of the external world and our inner world. We probably do not need to \"stop and stare as long as sheep, or cows\", as William Henry Davies would have us do in his poem, Leisure, but a moment to take stock can help us live in the now, rather than in the past or the future. Linked to the concept of mindfulness (with roots in Buddhism, Christianity and many other religions), the idea is that if we stop to notice the bird song or a passing cloud, we get in touch with ourselves and our physical world \u2013 what environmental psychologists define as \"nature relatedness\". The more you relate to nature, the more positive your emotions and the greater your life satisfaction.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/ S0169204610001465\" title=\"\">a Canadian study</a>, people who walked from A to B on a tree-lined path by a river were systematically happier than those walking the same trip via an underground tunnel system. And students and hospital patients who can see green out of their windows do better than those who do not.</p> <p>How this all benefits the planet is obvious: the more humans care about nature, the more they are likely to take actions to protect it.</p> <h2>Keep learning</h2> <p>Those with more open minds are happier, not only because they stay mentally vigorous but also because they gain a renewed sense of mastery.</p> <p>They are also more ready to adopt and adapt to our changing world. So they will be the people who accept, rather than ignore or resist, ideas such as warnings that the polar ice is disappearing and that we need to act.</p> <h2>Give</h2> <p>It is now well established by psychologists that the act of doing things for others actually makes us happier than receiving \u2013 although experts say this is, somewhat surprisingly, not readily accepted by most people. Giving can be something more abstract than volunteering or supporting a charity: \"It can be about thinking ahead and how to give a healthy planet to future generations, as yet unborn,\" says Huppert.</p> <p>The other key point listed on most happiness lists is that, beyond a certain level of material security, more money does not increase wellbeing. In the West, GDP has doubled in the last 35 years while wellbeing has barely budged.</p> <p>Of course, not every aspect of being happy has environmental benefits: getting a good exam grade makes you happy but does not help the planet, while buying a fast car can make you happy but is detrimental to the environment. But, overall, I feel pretty convinced by the evidence: that sorting out our mental state can help the environment, and that working to combat environmental damage can help make us happier.</p> <p>From Gandhi to Schumacher, and the former leader of the Green party, Caroline Lucas, to academics such as <a href=\"http://scorai2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ helliwell-final.pdf\" title=\"\">John Halliwell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ogilvie.fastmail.co.uk/healthyfuture/convergent.html\" title=\"\">Sandra Carlisle</a>, environmental thinkers have stressed the need to find routes other than material consumption to personal wellbeing. If we are to find ways of closing the north/south income gap without putting further pressure on the environment, we need as many tools in our toolkit as possible.</p> <p>So how about, as we look to promote a change in our consumerist lifestyles, selling it as a route to true happiness?</p> <p><em>Charlotte Sankey runs Creative Warehouse, a publishing and communications consultancy specialising in the environment, arts and education.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Periods of the earth's warming are associated with an increase in biodiversity, according to <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/08/27/1200844109.abstract\">a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>. While this may sound like good news, the timescales involved cancel out any benefits they might experience from the rising temperatures.</p> <p>The team behind the study, led by Dr Peter Mayhew at York University, examined the earth's geological history and fossil records using improved data sets that looked at patterns of marine invertebrate biodiversity over the last 540m years.</p> <p>They found that biodiversity increases over periods of warming in the earth's climate with many new species emerging, although these are simultaneously accompanied by extinctions of existing species.</p> <p>Mayhew said: \"What seems to be happening is that when we get a warming, this coincides with an upward shift in biodiversity in groups of organisms. So it looks like warm periods are boosting the generation of new species and that's improving biodiversity. However a bit later, and when I say 'a bit', I mean several millions of years later, you get extinctions occurring.\"</p> <p>\"It's a kind of a mixed picture,\" he added.\" We get an improvement in diversity but we also get extinction in new groups. It's just that overall the origination tends to out-do the extinction so biodiversity improves, generally.\"</p> <p>But Mayhew doesn't think this changes what we currently understand concerning the loss of species as a result of today's man-made global warming.</p> <p>\"I don't think that there is any good news here\", says Mayhew. \"If what we need for diversity to improve in these warm climates is time for those organisms to evolve, then that time is going to be much longer than the lifetime of the human race. The lifetime of a species tends to be 1-10m years in the record. So that's how long we can expect humans maybe to survive ... if we get a fair chance at life.</p> <p>\"But I'm afraid it's not good news in terms of what we might experience from global warming in the next few decades. Because obviously extinction can happen rapidly, but speciation [the generation of new species] can't happen rapidly. So unfortunately we're quite likely, simply because of the rate of climate change today, to see extinctions occurring. And we're unlikely to see the benefits that might go along with that, which is the generation of new species.\"</p> <p>Therefore despite of the possibility that climate change sceptics might takes these latest findings to suggest that the current warming of the planet is a good thing, Mayhew is very clear about what should be taken away from this study.</p> <p>\"Probably warming is good for speciation. In fact there are a lot of ecological studies that have suggested that there is the potential for earth to support biodiversity may in fact be greater under a global warming scenario. The difficulty is that potential doesn't necessarily translate into reality and species have to exist in order to fulfil that potential.</p> <p>\"I follow the scientific consensus here. The scientific consensus is definitely that current global warming is going to lead to a loss of biodiversity and potentially quite a significant loss. I don't think there is any good data to say otherwise at the moment and most of the data we have is strongly in that direction.\" He pointed out, for example, that there are big concerns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/09/acid-threat-coral-reef\" title=\"\">about what is happening in the coral reefs</a>.</p> <p>So while the study does give us an insight into what happened to species when the planet warmed millions of years ago, it doesn't contradict predictions of greater species extinctions due to current rates of climate change.</p> <p>Their findings contradict a previous study his team did in 2008 which found the opposite result: that biodiversity decreases when temperatures rise.</p> <p>Mayhew explained: \"Since 2008 new and better data and better techniques have come along which have enabled us to get a better picture of what's going on. And essentially the new data are different in that they take an ecological approach to sampling. They sample the fossil record like an ecologist today would sample a rainforest. In the past we haven't been able to do that properly.\"</p>",
  "<p>As Jeremy Hunt leaves the DCMS today, he will do so with the distinction of being the least mourned secretary of state in the culture department's history \u2013 as least as far as the arts world goes. As one senior British cultural figure put it, a line echoed repeatedly on Twitter this afternoon: \"Jim Naughtie spoke the thoughts of the entire culture sector when he<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/06/james-naughtie-today-jeremy-hunt\"> Freudian-slipped him</a>.\"</p> <p>Why has Hunt been so loathed?</p> <p>To answer that, one needs to go back several years, to 2008. </p> <p>When he was appointed shadow culture secretary, he set about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/feb/22/jeremy-hunt-arts-funding\">charming the arts world</a> \u2013 charm is a weapon that Hunt wields effortlessly \u2013 and did it very well. As the Brown government began to look increasingly moribund, its ministers thinner on ideas as they grappled with their own internal woes, up popped Hunt: keen as mustard, pitching up to lots of events, gamely giving speeches, attending conferences, showing willing. The message was that the Conservatives were eagerly awaiting the opportunity to become the party of the arts. As he said to me in 2010, the arts are \"fundamentally important\" to the Tories:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"People have had certain \u00adassumptions in the past about \u00adConservative governments, partly because of some of the things that happened in the 1980s, and partly because of the tone of some of the debate in the 1980s that appeared to say public spending on the arts was something you might want to progressively \u00adreduce. That isn't where the modern Conservative party stands.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Leaving aside how hollow those remarks might or might not now sound, in rhetorical terms, this was of course quite different from the punitive language employed against the arts by the previous Tory administration. Hunt's enthusiasm was welcomed. At last, people thought, here is a man who will make the case for the arts in the highest reaches of government. In his first speech as shadow culture secretary, Hunt <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/24/conservatives.politicsandthearts1\">promised </a>to \"support, nurture, and encourage\" the arts. </p> <p>But when it came to the crunch, there seemed to be very little nurture in the air: quite the opposite. While few in the arts would have argued that the culture budget should have been immune from necessary public spending cuts, there was a particular unpleasantness in the manner in which the 30% <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/arts-cuts-spending-review-council\">cuts to the arts</a> were handed down in 2010: presented as a 15% cut to \"front line\" services \u2013 a false division (front line/back office) if ever there was one. Then there was the sudden, immediate, brutal culling of the UK Film Council and Museums, Libraries, Archives Council: while few would have argued that either were model organisations, the ruthlessness with which they were despatched reeked of ideological fervour rather than considered action. In short, people began to suspect that Hunt's priority had been to wield the axe with an efficiency that would endear him to his superiors rather than to \"support, nurture and encourage the arts\". The early rhetoric looked, in retrospect, like a conscious decision to attempt to \"decontaminate\" brand Tory, rather than borne of any real conviction. The sense of betrayal \u2013 the rhetoric set next to the reality \u2013 has been enormous.</p> <p>Hunt's single big idea was to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/dec/08/jeremy-hunt-arts-funding-match\">encourage philanthropy</a>. All along, he claimed that so doing would pay off not in a year, or five years, but 100 years. There is something impressive in a minister so boldly attaching himself to a policy that could not pay dividends in the short term. But will it ever make any palpable difference? Hunt declared 2011 \"the year of corporate philanthropy\". This gesture seemed to result in precisely nothing. He announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jul/04/jeremy-hunt-arts-private-money\">match-funding schemes</a> for organisations keen to build up their endowments, eager to emulate a US philanthropic model. And yet he has never really recognised, to my mind, the deep problems caused in the US by endowments that, as the global economic crisis has deepened, are yielding less and less or yielding nothing at all; increasingly the US looks to our mixed economy as a model. Equally, the bungling of the tax breaks for charitable giving in the budget did nothing to inspire confidence in George Osborne's attachment to Hunt's ideas on philanthropy, or indeed the Government's competence. The kindly will say that time will be the judge of Hunt on this policy area: the sceptics will say that the early signs are not propitious.</p> <p>But still, better the devil you know, some might say. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/maria-miller-culture-secretary-cabinet-reshuffle?intcmp=239\">incoming culture secretary, Maria Miller</a>, has a reputation as a stonewaller, with little feeling for culture. Fervent is the hope that this reputation is unfounded, especially with another spending review perhaps on the way, and possible in-year cuts. </p> <p>Amelia Gentleman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/feb/16/maria-miller-disability-minister-benefits-reform\">interviewed</a> Miller last year. She tells me that one observation about the then disabilities minister ended up being cut from the published piece. It was this: that over a year into her tenure paintings by disabled people lay on the floor, still unhung. You might hope that that is not symbolic of things to come.</p>",
  "<p>Lunch with Helen Browning, chief executive of the Soil Association, is in many ways a vindication of the organic movement she leads. We meet at Canteen, on Bristol's Gloucester Road, a very socially mixed neighbourhood where people didn't just sign petitions against the opening of a Tesco Express, some planned to firebomb it, a plot that led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/apr/22/bristol-riot-police-injured\" title=\"\">riots when police raided the squat where they believed it was being hatched</a>. It is a sign that organic ideals are not a middle-class preserve that the food here is not only delicious but seasonal, from small local farms with high animal welfare and environmental standards. What's more, Browning's pea risotto and my sustainable mackerel cost less than many takeaways. But one word is conspicuous by its absence on Canteen's daily changing chalkboard menu: organic.</p> <p>It's a trend that can be seen at many farmers' markets, farm shops, restaurant and cafes that trade on their sustainable, ethical ethos. As many of the broad principles that organics advocates have become more mainstream, the prestige of actually being certified organic has diminished. Last year, the value of sales of organic foods in the UK <a href=\"http://www.sacert.org/news/newsandfeatures/articleid/3139/global-sales-of-organic-products-continue-to-defy-economic-downturn-as-uk-sales-lag-behind\" title=\"\">went down by 3.7%</a> and the number of producers and processors fell by 4% to 7,287.</p> <p>Sales of organic products have been falling since the credit crunch first bit in late 2008. But thrift alone does not seem to be enough to explain what is now a medium-term trend, since Fairtrade, another ethical certification with a price premium, has not suffered the same reverse, with sales rising by an estimated 12% last year. What seems to be the case is that customers who used to use the organic label as a kind of proxy for good, sustainable produce now look to the specific virtues that most concern them: seasonality, locality, fair trade or animal welfare. Indeed, sometimes their other ethical concerns trump the desire for organics, such as when they choose home-grown peas over air-freighted organic alternatives, or value the Fairtrade label more than Soil Association accreditation. For many, organic is no longer the top priority for good, ethical food.</p> <p>Indeed, even the Soil Association's own president, Monty Don, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/30/food.gardens\" title=\"\">acknowledged as much</a> when he took on the role in 2008: \"I would much rather someone bought food that was local and sustainable but not organic than bought organic food that had to be shipped across the world.\"</p> <p>So the question I wanted to chew over with Browning as we enter the associations's Organic September is whether \"organic\" as we have known it has had its day. For all the good the movement has done in challenging the most egregious practices of modern industrial farming, take any key issue on food and farming today and you will find that it's never simply a case of conventional bad, organics good, or even better.</p> <p>Take, for example, the issue of animal welfare. One reason for buying organic is that the standards required for welfare are pretty high. That, at least, is the intention, and as Dr Becky Whay, senior lecturer in animal welfare and behaviour at the University of Bristol, says: \"intention is worth quite a lot within the industry\". But the research that has been done on whether organic standards are all really better for animals \"is not very clear cut\" and she tells me several times that&#xa0;\"there are no easy answers\".</p> <p>Indeed, there may be some cases where organic animals are worse off. \"I would never raise livestock organically,\" wrote Susan, a US sheep and goat producer and college-educated scientist on her <a href=\"http://baalands.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">baalands</a> blog. She believes \"organic standards do not allow you to treat a sick animal with anything that is scientifically proven to be effective. You can't use antibiotics, anthelmintics, anti-inflammatories, coccidiostats, steroids, hormones, feed additives, or many other conventional therapies.\"</p> <p>It's actually more complicated than this, which is another reason why \"organic\" has become an inadequate guarantor of quality: people think \"organic\" has a clear, single meaning but standards vary between and sometimes within countries. There is a UK certification for Scottish Salmon, for example, but no EU standard for this or any other farmed fish. The EU sets the minimum standard for other organic produce, but it can be certified by one of 10 different bodies, all of which have their own set of rules. Most of the differences are quite small, but some are not: in America antibiotics are completely banned, in the UK their limited use is allowed. Because of the restrictions, however, Whay says that \"there are certainly areas where we know that the organic sector is struggling to deal with, such as digital dermatitis, which is an infectious foot disease of cattle, where we know mass antibiotic treatment is very effective\".</p> <p>The rules do state that the animal's welfare must come first, even if that means it loses its organic status by being treated. But this creates potentially bad incentives. As Roger Longman of the non-organic White Lake Cheeses puts it: \"A lot of farmers go: 'Well, she's not really, really sick, I won't treat her, I'll just hope she gets better,' and that's wrong, to my mind.\"</p> <p>Soil Association Standards also state that farmers \"must use complementary therapies and trace elements\" with the proviso \"provided that their healing effect works for the species and the condition you are treating\". This is not very reassuring to those who believe in evidence-based medicine when read in the light of standard 10.10.21, which says you should \"use effective homeopathy\".</p> <p>The Soil Association's recent strategy document, <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/news/newsstory/articleid/2647/the-road-to-2020-soil-association-launches-new-group-strategy\" title=\"\">The Road to 2020</a>, stated that organics must be \"rooted in robust science and supported by an extensive evidence base\". But unless you cherry-pick \u2013 which both defenders and detractors often do \u2013 the&#xa0;evidence appears to be very mixed. Washington State University professor John P Reganold is no apologist for big farming, having led the US's first and still only undergraduate major in organic agricultural systems. But <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/485176a.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20120510\" title=\"\">writing in Nature earlier this year</a>, he noted that the most recent meta-analysis showed \"organic farming systems in developed countries produce yields that are 20% lower than their conventional counterparts\". Even Browning doesn't deny that the evidence doesn't all stack up on the side of organics: \"On biodiversity, organic clearly has a lot to offer. On climate change, on the greenhouse gas&#xa0;side of things, it does in some areas&#xa0;and not others.\"</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest battle organics faces is that it has been robbed of one of its biggest selling points. Research by the Soil Association and Sustain suggests that the belief that organic food is \"healthier for me and my family\" is one of the main reasons why people buy organics, with 52% of customers citing it as a motivation \u2013 more than high animal welfare standards (34%) or it being more ethical (33%).</p> <p>But bit by bit the case for the health benefits of organic food has been undermined. Just this week <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19465692\" title=\"\">another review of the evidence</a> has been published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, which concluded that \"there isn't much difference between organic and conventional foods, if you are an adult and making a decision solely on your health\". This came as no surprise to Professor Alan Dangour of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, whose own 2010 review found no significant differences in the nutrient content or health benefits of&#xa0;organic food.</p> <p>All this simply reinforces the most comprehensive study to date, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jul/29/organic-food-nutrition-fsa\" title=\"\">an independent 2009 report commissioned by the Food Standards Agency</a> that surveyed over 50 years of evidence and concluded that \"organically and conventionally produced crops and livestock products are broadly comparable in their nutrient content.\" Nor was there any evidence of improved health from the more limited exposure to pesticide residues. Some farming practices can result in lower nutritional content and potential health risks, but it is never a simple case of all non-organic methods being worse than organic ones. For example, grass-fed cattle have been shown to produce more nutritionally rich milk, but these herds may be organic or conventional. This is probably why the only significant difference this week's study found was a higher level of omega-3 fatty acid in organic milk.</p> <p>The case for the health benefits of organics is so flimsy that the Soil Association has effectively been banned from making any claims for them. \"Anything we say, we ASA-proof it now, absolutely,\" says Browning, referring to the need to avoid sanction by the Advertising Standards Authority.</p> <p>So where does that leave us? I put it to Browning that the organic movement will probably continue to have an important role to play in the debate about the future of farming but right now it would be a distraction to make organics the centre of our discussion.</p> <p>\"It would be a distraction if we spent all our time debating whether certified organic or non-organic is the way forward,\" she replies. But she maintains it is \"absolutely critical\" that the organic movement \"both continues to make progress and continues to really inform the whole of agriculture. Organic principles need to be at the heart of where we farm everywhere.\"</p> <p>But what are those principles? The Soil Association identifies four: health, ecology, fairness and care. The trouble is that many farmers and consumers would affirm these principles without also agreeing that you have to farm organically to follow them. As Dominic Coyte of Borough Cheese Company tells me, although organics is \"a totally laudable reaction to the obsessive use of chemicals, it's not in itself a green light for quality and best practice\". The organic movement owns a very particular set of rules, not the fundamental principles that define good farming.</p> <p>Browning argues that the Association needs to \"let go of some of this in order that the rest of the world can take some ownership of it\". This is the direction the association started to indicate in <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/news/newsstory/articleid/2647/the-road-to-2020-soil-association-launches-new-group-strategy\" title=\"\">The Road To 2020</a>, which advocated \"increasing the number of non-organic farmers we work with\", maintaining that its \"future will be built on partnerships with other organisations and individuals who share our vision for the future of food, farming and land use\".</p> <p>Browning seems to accept that this will mean placing less emphasis on the importance of being organic per se. \"Whether it's 5%, 2% or 50% in terms of certified organic product is not the issue. The issue is that you've got a bunch of people striving to do more with less and that is what organic is really about.\"</p> <p>The organic movement has arguably achieved a great deal. On the biggest issues, it has really won the debate. Most people now accept that you can't just spray and inject your way to sustainable food production, that there is much to be gained from more integrated farming practices that deploy resources from the earth rather than from chemical factories. But as conventional farming adapts, the best way ahead becomes much less clear. If we want food that is good for humans, animals and the environment, the priority now is not to praise organics or&#xa0;to bury it, but to accept we must look beyond it.</p>",
  "<p>After a few relatively quiet days on the market, leading shares took a turn for the worse after disappointing US manufacturing data.</p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong> was among the biggest fallers after a hefty downgrade by analysts at Bernstein, which moved its recommendation from outperform to market perform. It forecast continuing revenue declines in Europe - no surprise, given the economic crisis in the eurozone - and said Vodafone's shares were likely to slide in similar fashion, despite the \"tantalising prospect\" of a bid from US partner Verizon at some point.</p> <p>Vodafone fell 4.75p to 178.45p.</p> <p>Overall, the day had seemed to be drifting lower - with investors nervous ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday - when an unexpected decline in US manufacturing pulled the rug from under the complacent attitude. The US ISM index dipped from 49.8 in July to 49.6, compared to expectations of a slight increase to around 50. An \"inadvertently\" leaked set of UK PMI services numbers - which seemed better than expected - did little to soothe market nerves. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 86.40 points lower at 5672.01, its biggest one day fall since 23 July.</p> <p>Chip maker <strong>Arm</strong> continued its decline after this week's downgrade from Deutsche Bank, falling another 31.5p to 528p.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> fell 5.8p to 220.7p after a leading analyst effectively gave up on the business. Ian Gordon at Investec downgraded from buy to hold, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Labour Party adopted D:Ream's hit, \"Things can only get better\" as its campaign tune for the 1997 general election, but it heralded a false dawn. Investors in RBS have had too many false dawns \u2013 \"underlying\" operating profits performing broadly \"in line with expectations\" but continuing to be dwarfed by material negative one-off items, of which there are still more coming down the pipe. Reducing non-core drag softens the blow, but after another modest rally, we throw in the towel. Downgrade to hold.</p> <p>In absolute terms, it remains speculative, and while it still appears moderately cheap as a long-term recovery play, we expect to see better entry levels emerge. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>British Land</strong>, which announced a \u00a3300m convertible bond issue, dropped 14.5p to 527p after UBS moved from buy to neutral following the shares' recent performance.</p> <p>But oil field services provider <strong>Petrofac</strong> was one of just three FTSE 100 companies to buck the downward trend, adding 2p to \u00a315.18 after a positive note from Credit Suisse. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After a period of weakness we upgrade Petrofac to outperform from neutral, with our target raised to \u00a318 from \u00a317,50. We believe the stock has performed poorly on a lack of project awards over the summer period and elevated expectations for the integrated energy services business. We believe the next few months will be better: awards should step up, thanks to less instability in the Middle East, and the payoff of extensive marketing efforts in southeast Asia and amongst oil majors. There remain a number of risks. However, the stock is now the cheapest on enterprise value/earnings in the European sector, which we regard as extraordinary given the long term track record, and see limited downside. </p> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Ashtead</strong>, which rents out small tools to construction and power generation equipment, added 33.4p to 315.9p after it said first quarter profits jumped 82% to a record \u00a361.4m. A gradual improvement in the US, where it conducts some 80% of its business through its Sunbelt subsidiary, helped offset the difficult conditions in the UK.</p> <p>Drycleaning to facilities management company <strong>Johnson Service Group</strong> closed 2p higher at 30p after an upbeat statement despite a \u00a3500,00 drop in half year profits to \u00a36m as it closed 103 shops after a strategic review. House broker Investec was positive:</p> <blockquote> <p>Johnson Service has delivered a satisfactory overall performance against a difficult trading background. The two main divisions have performed well and whilst dry cleaning has been impacted by a very difficult trading environment, a substantial restructuring of that business will reduce its costs significantly. Helped by recent acquisitions that have integrated well, we are raising our forecasts [with profits up from \u00a314.65m to \u00a315.8m] and maintain our buy recommendation on a business that is lowly rated and has good medium term growth prospects.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, investors in <strong>Chariot Oil and Gas</strong> suffered a rocky ride. The company's shares fell sharply on worries about its Nimrod exploration project offshore Namibia. It had announced the start of drilling on the latest well, Kabeljou, at the end of July, and the market seemed to be unnerved by a lack of news. Analysts at Daniel Stewart said at the time of the July announcement that it would take 60 days to drill, and Chariot reacted to the day's share price fall by saying the results of the well were not yet known. Daniel Stewart, which put a buy recommendation on Chariot in its July note, did warn of the risks:</p> <blockquote> <p>We see the [Kabeljour] results as being the number one upcoming catalytic event for Chariot's share price; in the event of a success we anticipate a dramatic upturn. However, in the event of the well coming up dry, a collapse is more than likely. Chariot ended 21p lower at 100.25p.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Andrew Mitchell can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/04/andrew-mitchell-justine-greening-uk-development?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">leave the UK's Department for International Development</a> (DfID) with his head held high. He has been a passionate defender of the need for the UK to help people living in poverty around the world, at an economically difficult time when many in his own party \u2013 and beyond \u2013 have demanded the country behave more selfishly.</p> <p>The first task for his successor, former transport secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/justine-greening\" title=\"\">Justine Greening</a>, must be to build on Mitchell's work. She should ensure the UK government maintains its commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid by 2013. Next year's budget will reveal whether the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/feb/02/government-backs-away-pledge-aid-law\" title=\"\">government has kept its promise</a> not to balance the UK's books on the backs of the poorest.</p> <p>Aid transforms the lives of millions of people, but alone it will never end poverty. There will never be enough of it. UK development policy must be driven by the principle that our aid should not be needed any more.</p> <p>So next on Greening's list should be a credible DfID exit strategy from aid, a plan that not only delivers value for money for UK taxpayers by attacking the global forces that keep people poor, but also helps developing countries tackle poverty and hunger themselves.</p> <p>Greening should pursue this even as she explains why, in the short-to-medium term, the UK must continue supporting people living in poverty by providing aid.</p> <p>The starting point for an exit strategy has three letters: T, A, X. Developing countries will stop needing aid when they get better at collecting revenue themselves. Today, these countries lose approximately $160bn annually as a result of tax dodging by multinational companies alone, <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/actnow/trace-the-tax/background.aspx\" title=\"\">according to my employer Christian Aid</a>. This is more than the global annual aid budget.</p> <p>Last month, MPs on the House of Commons international development committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/tax-in-developing-countries-report/\" title=\"\">published a superb report addressing exactly this challenge</a>. As the cross-party committee stated, if developing countries are to emerge from poverty and aid dependency, it is imperative they get better at collecting tax. At present, such countries collect vastly less tax than rich countries as a proportion of their GDP, with obvious \u2013 and appalling \u2013 consequences for public services.</p> <p>One solution, which DfID is already promoting and should do more on, is to support poor countries' tax authorities, which currently face a painfully unequal struggle against the highly-paid accountants and lawyers working for the wealthy and powerful.</p> <p>But that's far from the end of the story. As the MPs also recognised, the UK itself can help fight the damage done by tax dodging in poor countries. Part of the answer is to require multinationals to reveal more about their finances in each country where they operate; another part is to push for international co-operation to end the tax-haven secrecy that currently does so much for tax dodgers, money launderers, and bribe-takers.</p> <p>These reforms are so important for people living in poverty that Greening should champion them as passionately as Mitchell has with aid. But she will need to work with her Treasury and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) colleagues to get them implemented.</p> <p>This will be difficult. There are some powerful interests backing the secretive status quo, and the Treasury and BIS know it. These are the companies that hide money away in tax havens, capitalising on the absence of global rules and the weak governance in poor countries to take money from those who most need it.</p> <p>But without joined-up government, what DfID gives in aid will be outweighed by the money siphoned off by tax-dodgers. This is something that Greening should repeat publicly and often.</p> <p>Of course, we also expect the government to deliver on its 0.7% commitment. This is the right thing to do. It's a promise we made to the world's poorest people, and it needs to be delivered.</p> <p>But aid will only ease hunger and pay for basics such as education and vaccines while rich countries continue to give it. So what we most want from Greening is an intelligent exit strategy from aid, one that allows developing countries to become independent. That strategy should start with tax.</p>",

  "<h2>The winners</h2> <p>The last weekend of the school summer holiday has never exactly been a premium release date in the UK: over the past couple of years we've seen such venerated classics as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/sep/01/fright-night-film-review\" title=\"\">Fright Night</a>, Apollo 18 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/sep/02/dinner-for-schmucks-film-review\" title=\"\">Dinner for Schmucks</a> dumped on to the market. So this year's batch of end-of-summer releases, while hardly eliciting critical hosannas or audience stampedes, is certainly no worse than usual. Between them, new releases <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148835/total-recall\" title=\"\">Total Recall</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a> kicked in \u00a34.7m in box-office, pushing aside Brave to grab the top two spots in the weekend chart.</p> <p>It's worth noting, however, that both saw their figures inflated by significant previews: two days' worth in the case of Total Recall (\u00a3959,000 of the \u00a32.49m total) and four days for The Watch (\u00a31.43m of the \u00a32.24m). Total Recall's sum compares with \u00a31.90m for the first weekend of wide play for the Paul Verhoeven original \u2013 and that was back in 1990, when tickets were significantly cheaper than today. As for The Watch, Ben Stiller's last film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144194/tower-heist\" title=\"\">Tower Heist</a> debuted with \u00a31.45m including \u00a3311,000 in previews last November.</p> <p>Excluding previews from the tallies, The Watch in fact landed in lowly fifth place, with \u00a3803,000. That's behind fellow new entrant The Possession, which debuted just shy of \u00a31m, as well as holdover titles Brave and Ted. With \u00a317.9m so far, Brave has already overtaken Pixar's worst-performing titles Cars (\u00a316.5m) and Cars 2 (\u00a315.6m), and now has Disney's Tangled (\u00a320.5m) in its sights. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>, with \u00a328.1m, is closing in on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/jul/13/ice-age-4-continental-drift-video-review\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> (\u00a329.1m) to become the third-biggest box-office hit of 2012 so far.</p> <h2>The losers</h2> <p>Biggest faller in the chart, with a drop of 69%, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148902/keith-lemon\" title=\"\">Keith Lemon: The Film</a>. Critical ratings were predictably horrendous (<a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/keith_lemon_the_film/\" title=\"\">0% fresh at Rotten Tomatoes</a>). More challenging for distributor Lionsgate are user ratings of 2.5 out of 10 at IMDb, and 1.7 out of 5 at Rotten Tomatoes. Assuming these ratings are by people who actually saw the film, the TV spinoff is not set for a sustained healthy life at cinemas. The DVD should be in stores for Christmas.</p> <p>Lionsgate may take comfort that Keith Lemon in week two still managed to gross more than rival comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149067/few-best-men\" title=\"\">A Few Best Men</a> in its debut. The Australia-set film, which could be pitched as The Hangover meets Meet the Parents, kicked off with a weak \u00a3264,000 from 291 screens, and an average of \u00a3906. It surely can't help that there are currently five comedies in the market \u2013 the others are Ted, The Watch and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147184/three-stooges\" title=\"\">The Three Stooges</a> \u2013 playing on a combined 1,900 screens.</p> <h2>The arthouse battle</h2> <p>Given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a>'s impressive debut the previous weekend, and its expansion to 77 screens, a solid hold was always likely. But it faced potentially tough competition from the newly arrived <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148212/berberian-sound-studio\" title=\"\">Berberian Sound Studio</a>, which benefited from similar critical acclaim, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/30/berberian-sound-studio-review\" title=\"\">five stars from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw</a>. In the event, The Imposter won the spoils, not just with a bigger weekend gross (\u00a3212,000 v \u00a343,000), but also a higher screen average (\u00a32,755 v \u00a31,871). Partly thanks to the expansion, The Imposter posted the most robust hold of any film in the top 20, down just 5%. Although not benefiting from the same critical buzz as Berberian, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143130/samsara\" title=\"\">Samsara</a> achieved a virtually identical sum at the box office. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143110/take-this-waltz\" title=\"\">Take This Waltz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147796/searching-for-sugar-man\" title=\"\">Searching for Sugar Man</a> are also both hanging on in the top 30, and have now reached \u00a3284,000 and \u00a3331,000 respectively. The success of these five films, catering to the tastes of most arthouse film fans, created a tough environment for competitor titles. After several weeks of play, both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/09/360-review\" title=\"\">360</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/09/jackpot-review\" title=\"\">Jackpot</a> have yet to pass \u00a3100,000, for example, and see the Other openers chart below for the very modest sum earned at the weekend by US indie <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/139141/myth-of-the-american-sleepover\" title=\"\">The Myth of the American Sleepover</a>.</p> <p>Berberian Sound Studio's opening compares with \u00a329,000 from 17 screens for the debut of Peter Strickland's previous feature <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130512/katalin-varga\" title=\"\">Katalin Varga</a>, back in October 2009. The Imposter's tally of \u00a3694,000 after two weekends compares with \u00a3493,000 for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146456/marley\" title=\"\">Marley</a> at the same stage. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141505/senna\" title=\"\">Senna</a> had taken a highly impressive \u00a31.1m at this point in its run, by which time it was already playing at 122 cinemas.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Overall, the market proved to be the very definition of middling: 2% up from the previous weekend; 1% up on the equivalent frame from 2011; and 3% down on average weekend takings for the past year. With most kids returning to school this week, the autumn movie season now kicks off with the arrival on Friday of prestige fare including Joe Wright's Tolstoy adaptation <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149093/anna-karenina\" title=\"\">Anna Karenina</a> and John Hillcoat's prohibition-era crime saga <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146652/lawless\" title=\"\">Lawless</a>. Not so prestigiously, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149147/dredd\" title=\"\">Dredd</a> offers violent genre pleasures, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146343/that-s-my-boy\" title=\"\">That's My Boy</a> is the latest comedy from Adam Sandler. Acclaimed documentary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149068/queen-of-versailles\" title=\"\">The Queen of Versailles</a> and Berlin film festival discovery Tabu enter the cluttered arthouse space. All titles face a potentially dangerous adversary in the weather \u2013 at the end of a disappointing summer, hours of sunshine tend to be especially cherished, and not to be frittered away by visits to darkened cineplexes.</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/80204/total-recall\" title=\"\">Total Recall</a>, \u00a32,493,230 from 464 sites (<strong>New</strong>)</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a>, \u00a32,235,933 from 419 sites (<strong>New</strong>)</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a>, \u00a31,604,163 from 548 sites.

  "<p>Freiburg in southern Germany is a remarkable place. It has a population of 240,000 and keeps winning prizes and accolades for its high quality of life. This achievement manifests itself in low levels of congestion and pollution, high levels of cycling, highly integrated and high quality bus, rail and tram services, high levels of renewable energy from sun and wind, internationally acclaimed car-free residential areas and huge success in job creation related to research and development and renewable energy. The problems that most similar UK cities face simply do not exist in Freiburg.</p> <p>Arriving at the main railway station provides direct access to the main bus station, a major tram stop and a cycling hub where bikes can be hired, parked and repaired. Public transport tickets cover the whole network and moving from tram to bus to local train is so easy that it makes car use unattractive by comparison.</p> <p>There is no rural transport problem. Buses and trains serve rural areas from very early until late at night and cover a dense network. If you are a visitor staying in the wider region in a hotel or a holiday home you pick up a \"konus card\", which grants free public transport throughout the region. Freiburg has a thriving retail sector in the city centre with no significant development of out-of-town shopping malls.</p> <p>So how does Freiburg achieve all this when UK cities in the main have relatively poor quality public transport and low levels of cycling? Those who live in Freiburg make 28% of all trips every day by bike, while in Manchester the figure is 1%; the car in Freiburg accounts for 30% of all trips every day, when a UK city will see 60% of all trips taken by car.</p> <p>In a recent <a href=\"http://scorecard.inrix.com/scorecard/summary.asp\" title=\"\">international survey of congestion</a>, Britain came out fourth worst out of 25 (only Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands fared worse). Germany was much lower down the list, with lower levels of congestion linked to the significantly higher quality of alternatives to the car.</p> <p>Britain is generally a poor performer on quality of life compared to Germany, Denmark, Switzerland and Austria. If this causes patriotic alarm, the antidote is to visit Freiburg, Copenhagen, Lund, Delft or Groningen where the many delights of moving around and enjoying high quality spaces can soak in and stimulate a desire to improve.</p> <p>Poor performance in Britain goes wider and deeper than just transport and public realm; it embraces child and elderly poverty, inequality, obesity and very poor levels of renewable energy.</p> <p>Britain was not always an international laggard; major improvements in sanitation and drinking water improved our largest cities in the closing decades of the 19th century, and after the great smog that killed thousands of Londoners in 1952 we produced clean air legislation.</p> <p>But now we are like rabbits caught in headlights and incapable of sorting out the approximately 20,000 deaths that are attributable to air pollution in the UK every year. Low emission zones can help to tackle this problem, but Britain has only three \u2013 and only one of these impacts on all vehicles \u2013 compared to 47 in German cities. This should be a matter of serious public policy concern.</p> <p>The how and why of Britain's underperformance is the central theme of my new book, <a href=\"http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415509558/\" title=\"\">Quality of Life and Public Management</a>. There is no simple explanation but it can still be found in the underfunding of local government, the over-centralisation of authority in Whitehall, the lack of fit between councillors and the people they represent and the British fetish around economic growth and regeneration that misses so many opportunities to provide by a broader vision.</p> <p>The good news is that we can make a change, and Britain can be in the top rankings of performers.

  "<p>Last week gave us the first chance to see what the OEMs had in mind when it comes to Windows 8 tablets. I'm left regarding the whole affair with the same affection that I might feel for a cat that's sicked up a hairball made of plastic and silicon on my front-room carpet. </p> <h2>Innovation</h2> <p>We're two-and-a-half years into the \"iPad market\", and I don't think anyone would say that product has been a failure. Now that Windows 8 is done with its magical reimagined touchable-ness the OEMs can now all get together and start creating fantastic kit that spanks the boys and girls of Cupertino. But no - instead of kit worthy of Windows 8, we get a bunch of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack+netbooks\">revamped netbooks</a>, a technology the market rejected around the same time its love affair with the iPad started.</p> <p>I've created a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmTd8H-R__8wdEdMWlY1cFU3RkUtak9BZGxVSDRyWGc\">little spreadsheet of what was announced</a>. Three Windows RT devices, and eight Windows 8 devices.</p> <p>Of the eleven devices, ten of them are irrevocably meshed together with the idea of the keyboard. All ten are presented with keyboard in tow and, to my mind, that positions them as netbooks. (I'm indebted to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drpizza\">Peter Bright</a> for pointing out that the Samsung ATIV Windows RT device doesn't currently have a keybaord option.) The only thing the manufacturers have done is taken old designs, refreshed them, and made it possible to take the keyboard off. None of them has worked as hard as Microsoft and produced something innovative that moves the story forward like the upcoming Surface devices do.</p> <p>But that whole idea of keyboards on post-PC devices? I won't rest until they're expunged from the post-PC proposition. I'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this.</p> <h2>\"But you need a keyboard for real work!\"</h2> <p>Yes, I totally agree that if you want to input information into a computer you need a keyboard. The only problem with that premise is that the iPad isn't a computer.</p> <p>I'm a believer in that generally as a community we technicians are able to provide the market with what it needs. The market demands, we provide a solution. Oh - half of the time we forget to do that and try and foist onto the market things that it doesn't need - i.e. the classic \"solution seeking problem\" that so often seems to define the work we do. </p> <p>Because we know that most people don't use a keyboard with the iPad, and even those who own a keyboard don't use it all the time, we know that the iPad doesn't need one. People get along just fine with their iPad entirely unnumbered by plasticy panels of microswitches. Yet in bizarro-OEM-land it's like they can't conceive of a world where people don't use their iPads with keyboards. Yet I wonder how many engineers or managers over at the OEMs actually use keyboards with their iPads.</p> <p>Real computers need keyboards, which is why desktops and laptops have them. What's not clear to me is why people think that Windows 8 running on something that looks like an iPad should suddenly become a clamshell laptop. That conflation is dangerous. You don't need to choose between a real computer or an iPad, you likely need both.</p> <p>Think about the last meeting you were in where one of your cohorts brought their iPad. Yes, yes, poser, bla, bla. The important part though is how they turned their attention from the meeting to the data on the screen and back again in a fluid way that, hopefully, didn't piss off all the other participants. </p> <p>The iPad is very sympathetic to that environment because it's not the primary activity in the room. Each attendee almost certainly has a proper computer back at their desk, but sitting in a meeting clattering away at a keyboard doesn't work; which is why people actually switch modes and go into a meeting room to conflab in the first place. They're looking to get away from their computers and concentrate on each other. The interesting part about the iPad is that it's the first computing device that gets to go with their owners into that environment.</p> <p>What the OEMs have shown this week is that they understand that proposition not one jot. Hence the keyboards. </p> <h2>Surface</h2> <p>Wedding a keyboard to a tablet doesn't make it a better tablet. It just makes an ugly mess. The Surface isn't ugly, because Microsoft has used what's currently the dirtiest of dirty words: \"innovation\", and made a keyboard that's sympathetic to the device.</p> <p>I know in my heart I'm never going to win my battle to banish the keyboard from the post-PC debate. But what I think will happen is that as far as the mobility story goes, the laptop form factor will continue to improve. There will always be some form of terminal optimised for data input, at least until we all have a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYsbD5hewig\">little AI as our constant companion</a>. </p> <p>More to the point, that story is going to get more intense. It looks like <a href=\"http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-surface-street-ads-reveal-its-slogan-click-in\">Microsoft will use the strapline \"Click in\"</a> to sell Surface. I don't think that \"click\" refers to a mouse - I think it's an allegory to the sound made by \"clicking in\" the keyboard. That's an easy wedge to drive into the iPad space, because people think keyboards are needed and the iPad doesn't have one.</p> <p>Windows 8 is fantastic, and there are some great pieces of kit coming out in the Ultrabook name that get the mobility/functionality balance right and let you do \"real world\". But these need to be augmented with low-cost, non-computers. If you want, call them \"tablets\".</p> <p>The crazy thing is that it doesn't have to be this way. Something which didn't get much play was that <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/31/3282360/samsung-wqhd-2560-1440-dual-display-laptop-prototypes\">Samsung had an innovation gallery</a> on show. One of the laptops had a display on both sides of the lid. Virtually all of the tablets still had a keyboard option, but all put some distance between them and the \"Right, so we just slap a clip-on hinge here and we're done, right?\" paradigm. They're more Surface than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC\">Asus Eee</a>.</p> <p>What we now know, though, is that on the consumer side, Surface is probably the only game in town. It's the only model that is properly post-PC and can go toe-to-toe with the iPad's proposition. Then it's just a matter of getting the apps story and the marketing right.</p> <p>On the business side, the story is less clear. It's going to take the channel creating compelling Metro-style* solutions that runs on \"good enough\" hardware to make business think twice about enterprise-supply of iPads. But will Surface sell in business? Surely not. What CTO is going to buy a thousand units of a tablet from an OEM with zero experience in the market? That CTO will go out and buy HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc - they will buy from a vendor they already have experience of. So if you're hoping your company will buy you a Surface, you may be out of luck. You might just end up with a revamped netbook.</p> <p><em>* Metro-style, of course, refers to the Windows 8 app model based on the WinRT APIs, with the (unnamed) user interface design, and with fully trusted deployment. Or am I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/aug/14/windows-8-metro-microsoft-newspeak\">now allowed to call it that</a> \u2026</em></p> <p><em>Matthew Baxter-Reynolds is an independent software development consultant, trainer and author based in the UK.

  "<p>Last July three men left their village to hunt. They returned to witness, at a distance, the alleged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/amazon-tribe-massacre-alleged-venezuela?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">murder of their entire community</a>. Men, women and children were killed in an attack that involved crude explosives, executions and a helicopter strafing the village with machine-gun fire. The main building, which served among other things as meeting hall and religious centre, was burnt to the ground. The bodies were cremated, presumably to hide the crime.</p> <p>The village concerned was the <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8626\" title=\"\">remote settlement of Irotatheri</a>, an \"uncontacted\" group of Yanomami native Americans living in the southern Venezuelan state of Amazonas near the border with Brazil. Although it is horrific enough that around 80 people may have died in this brutal assault, the tragedy grows even worse when you realise that this village's entire sub-culture may have been destroyed. Illegal goldminers from Brazil (<em>garimpeiros</em>) who are presumed to have carried out the killings will take advantage of this atrocity to exploit the land in the most destructive fashion.</p> <p>The assault was brought to light by Horonami, a Yanomami umbrella organisation that campaigns to protect indigenous rights. The extreme remoteness of the settlement meant that news of the massacre had taken weeks to reach the outside world. Activists had, however, been able to talk directly to survivors and eyewitnesses, and, although details were still sketchy, the basic events were clear. <a href=\"http://assets.survivalinternational.org/documents/793/declaration-from-indigenous-organizations-of-the-amazon-regarding-the-yanomami-massacre.pdf\" title=\"\">Horonami, along with 15 other indigenous organisations</a>, called for an immediate public investigation.</p> <p>Over the weekend, however, Nicia Maldonado, the Venezuelan minister for indigenous peoples, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/world/americas/no-sign-of-massacre-in-amazon-venezuelan-officials-say.html?_r=2\" title=\"\">gave a statement to the press</a> denying that any such attack had taken place. She says that a committee has surveyed the known Yanomami communities in the area and found no evidence of any such assault \u2013 no eyewitnesses, no burnt longhouse, no bodies. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/03/world/americas/no-sign-of-massacre-in-amazon-venezuelan-officials-say.html?_r=2\" title=\"\">Additional sources blame initial reports</a> on \"some media outlets and destabilising sectors seeking to generate uncertainty in the population\" \u2013 a sample of <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/news/regions/americas/venezuela/venezuela-chavismo-chavez-capriles\" title=\"\">Chavista</a> rhetoric that suggests the government might have had its own motives not to find evidence of these killings <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-venezuela-amazon-tribebre88300i-20120903,0,2172993.story\" title=\"\">during a survey of millions of acres of thickly forested land that took less than a week</a>.</p> <p>Whether massacre or miscommunication, the context in which this story has emerged reveals why indigenous groups would so readily believe such a killing might take place, and why some communities might choose to remain uncontacted.</p> <p>That term <a href=\"http://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3109-questions-and-answers-uncontacted-tribes\" title=\"\">\"uncontacted\"</a> is often <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/feb/04/amazon-uncontacted-tribe-media-coverage?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">taken somewhat literally</a> and used to present such groups as cut off from the world \u2013 <a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Noble_savage\" title=\"\">noble savages</a> living in primitive and timeless ways. This ignores the fact that these groups are in contact with other indigenous communities \u2013 as can be seen in this case \u2013 and through them <a href=\"http://voices.yahoo.com/how-globalization-has-impacted-yanomami-people-6589416.html\" title=\"\">engage in trade and information exchange</a> with the outside world. Moreover, the rhetoric of \"primitive man\" serves a colonial narrative that portrays an uncontacted community using guns or wearing T-shirts as somehow fallen or impure, and as no longer having the inherent rights of the original inhabitants of colonised lands.</p> <p>Naturally, the Yanomami and other indigenous groups have been changed by colonial encounters. There have now been centuries of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_history_of_indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas\" title=\"\">new diseases wiping out entire peoples</a>, <a href=\"http://ufam.academia.edu/PatriciaSampaio/Papers/1101410/Native_Americans_I_-_Amazon\" title=\"\">unequal armed conflicts</a>, enslavement and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/world/americas/24pope.html\" title=\"\">forced conversion</a>. The Trans-Amazonian highway, pushed through in the 1970s by the military government, has opened up huge areas for exploitation. Despite the best efforts of people such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A2ndido_Rondon\" title=\"\">C\u00e2ndido Rondon</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villas-B%C3%B4as_brothers\" title=\"\">Villas-B\u00f4as brothers</a>, the relationship between the state and its indigenous inhabitants has been one of exploitation and destruction. As with deep settler states as different as <a href=\"http://www3.nfb.ca/enclasse/doclens/visau/index.php?mode=theme&amp;language=english&amp;theme=30662&amp;film=16933&amp;excerpt=612109&amp;submode=about&amp;expmode=2\" title=\"\">Canada</a> and <a href=\"http://www2.brandonu.ca/library/cjns/14.2/hele.pdf\" title=\"\">Russia</a>, indigenous peoples were treated as an obstacle to be bought off or threatened.</p> <p>A gold rush in the late 1980s and 1990s is the most immediate cause to fear outsiders. <a href=\"http://books.google.com.cy/books?id=deb1ixo2MBQC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=yanomami+-tierney+miners&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1qopmDcJLV&amp;sig=cyJTMZ3NHGXZ8yDltbvqRokYFjM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wr5DUMSZJvT34QSe24HoCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=el%20dorado&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">As many as 40,000 miners</a>, encouraged by the Brazilian government, entered the territory occupied by 20,000 Yanomami. They poisoned drinking water, raped women, and spread STIs and other diseases. Less than 20 years ago, a group of <em>garimpeiros</em> committed another massacre, killing at least 16 in the village of Haximu. Although some were later imprisoned for genocidal crimes, others escaped scot free. Both Brazil and Venezuela have since taken great strides to incorporate protection of indigenous groups into their constitutions, but in practice they have not prevented such miners continuing to enter and exploit Yanomami territory.</p> <p>A question that is often asked in discussions about indigenous peoples, especially uncontacted groups, is why they don't simply give up and try to prosper in modern technological culture. Aren't they just clinging to traditions out of fear, or to get special treatment? Obviously the most important point is that people should be allowed the right of self-determination; but the history of violence and degradation shown to the Yanomami shows why, for some groups, avoiding contact remains a logical choice.</p> <p>It must be hoped that Nicia Maldonado does not prove them right: either by covering up a terrible crime, or failing to take action against the <em>garimpeiros</em>.</p>",
  "<p>School examination results will always be associated with groups of laughing young girls, the image that inevitably dominates our newspapers and screens on results days. Girls now outstrip boys in the proportion of top grades achieved in all but a handful of subjects at key stage three. Not only are they much more likely to get good grades than boys, they are more likely to take key stage 3 qualifications in the first place.</p> <p>Last year there were 40,000 more female A-level applicants than male. This disparity is especially shocking when you consider that <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/files/39DemandforHEto2029summary.doc\" title=\"\">according to research by the Higher Education Policy Institute</a> there are around 65,000 more boys aged 18 to 20 than girls.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising, then, that female applicants far outnumber male applicants to higher education. <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Documents/PatternsAndTrendsinUKHigherEducation.pdf\" title=\"\">Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency</a> (HESA) show that female school leavers are 30% more likely to apply to university than male. The Universities UK publication, <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Publications/Pages/Publication-294.aspx\" title=\"\">Patterns in UK HE</a>, illustrates the trend very well: the proportion of women undergraduates is around 57%, a gap that has widened every year in recent times.</p> <p>Statistics from the HESA report, <a href=\"http://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2411&amp;Itemid=278\" title=\"\">Students in Higher Education Institutions 2010/11</a>, show how wide the gap between men and women students has become in some subject areas. The starkest divide is in veterinary science where women accounted for more than 75% of students. They also made up more than 66% of those studying law and more than 67% taking languages.</p> <p>Figures from the same report also reveal a gender imbalance at individual institutions. Women students outnumber men by three to two in many universities, and in some institutions where there are large teaching or nursing courses by as many as two to one. The gap is less pronounced at many Russell group institutions \u2013 women are still in the minority (just) at Oxford and Cambridge. It will be interesting to see if the unrestricted recruitment of AAB students has affected those numbers in 2012. Girls are far more likely to be in this group than boys. Last year they made up almost 60% of the AAB cohort.</p> <p>This growing gender gap matters and we should take action now to address it, perhaps by finding a way to include boys, particularly those that attend non-selective state schools, in the widening participation agenda. It is clear that the problem is starting at school and I would urge universities to consider tailoring some outreach activities to encourage boys to see higher education as an option and take the A-level or equivalent qualifications needed to apply.</p> <p>Bahram Bekradnia, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI), whose 2009 report is still <a href=\"http://www.hepi.ac.uk/466-1409/Male-and-female-participation-and-progression-in-Higher-Education.html\" title=\"\">the best commentary on the gender divide, </a> believes addressing gender in widening participation programmes is \"spot on\".</p> <p>\"I made the suggestion myself some time ago but there was strong resistance in HEFCE to doing anything along those lines,\" he says. \"They were very wedded to the assumption that the problem was mainly social class (which it may well be) and were concerned that a focus on gender issues would detract from the bigger problem\"</p> <p>Bekradnia is unconvinced that it is an either/or issue, nor that class issues are more important than gender issues: \"They may be but I don't know the evidence is there. We need to focus our widening participation activity on those matters where we have the biggest problem\".</p> <p>Professor Geoff Whitty, director emeritus at the <a href=\"http://www.ioe.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Education,</a> also sees merit in the idea: \"Reviewing the literature on the achievement and participation gap recently, I noticed how gender was not seen as the big issue it was when I was first looking at access 30 years ago. But looking at recent statistics, boys \u2013 and not just white working class boys \u2013 may need to become the focus of widening participation activities in the future.\"</p> <p>If access to higher education has become an equality issue for men then access to positions of equal power and pay remain the overwhelming equality issue for women in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-gender-gap/\" title=\"\">According to the World Economic Forum</a>, the UK ranks first in the world for equality in education \u2013 but 33rd for economic equality.</p> <p>It is also a pertinent subject for higher education professionals \u2013 the most read article on the Higher Education Network to date addresses <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/may/24/why-women-leave-academia\" title=\"\">women's reluctance to become research academics and follow a career in academia</a>.

They claim the initiative to engage with protesters will \"enable greater communication, understanding and facilitation of peaceful protests\".</p> <p>But one campaigner has complained that police harassed her by making an unexpected visit to her home, grilling her about who was organising a planned protest and whether she was a member of a political group.</p> <p>The campaigner, who does not want to be identified, filmed the unannounced visit by two plainclothes police officers to her home in Brighton, Sussex.</p> <p>The two officers, who said they were protest liaison officers from Sussex police, raised the subject of a demonstration that was due to be held by UK Uncut, the campaign against tax avoidance, in Brighton the following week.</p> <p>In testy exchanges, one officer asks her repeatedly whether she is a member of UK Uncut. She replied that she did not think it necessary for her to say whether she was or not. She asked the officers why they thought she was a member of the campaign.</p> <p>The officer replied: \"Because I have seen you on many demonstrations, and you have been leading the demonstrations. I am not saying that you were the organiser, but you have been a leader on these sorts of things.\"</p> <p>He then asked her who is the organiser of the planned demonstration. She declined to answer his questions.</p> <p>After passing her film to the Guardian, she said: \"It was not building communication or dialogue at all \u2013 it was them coming to my house to intimidate me and attempt to gather information.\"</p> <p>One of the officers had previously worked for a surveillance unit, known as a forward intelligence team, that regularly monitored demonstrations and meetings. Sussex police said the officer was working purely as a protest liaison officer on that day, although the force \"recognised that this could be seen by some as a conflict in roles\".</p> <p>At the demonstration in June, the campaigner claims she saw the same officer in uniform policing the protesters, wielding his baton while the far-right English Defence League were marching nearby.</p> <p>She challenged the officer about why he had his baton out when he had been acting as a protest liaison officer, asking him if he realised what image he was presenting at that moment.</p> <p>Sussex police said that although the intended role of protest liaison officers was \"not to deal with situations of conflict, they are fully trained police officers who are responsible for their own risk assessment and safety\".</p> <p>The introduction of the liaison officers followed a report in which an official watchdog said police were struggling to cope with often dynamic demonstrations they had not been formally notified of in advance and that had no identifiable organisers. Some protest groups have so little trust in the police that they do not want to talk to them before demonstrations.</p> <p>Val Swain, of the police monitoring group, Netpol, said police were using the tactic of engaging with protesters to \"develop their intelligence-gathering capacity\".</p> <p>Sussex police rejected the allegation, saying the role of the protest liaison officers was not to gather intelligence about campaigners.</p> <p>Ch Insp Paul Betts said: \"Their primary role will be to increase engagement with protest groups by supporting an open and honest two-way dialogue with them, before, during and after events.</p> <p>\"By doing this, we hope to better facilitate peaceful protest and provide a safe environment for the protesters and others in [Brighton].</p> <p>\"With a better picture of protesters' intentions, we can police proportionally and reduce the number of officers assigned to a protest, allowing them to focus on the other issues which we know are important to our communities.\"</p> <p>The force added that protesters could ask not to be visited at their homes or did not have to answer questions from the liaison officers.</p>",

A fifth of the planet's plant species are in danger of extinction within the next century, said <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/about-kew/who-we-are/director-stephen-hopper/index.htm\" title=\"\">Prof Stephen Hopper</a> in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, and governments around the world needed to make firm plans to reverse the decline.</p> <p>\"We're at a crossroads in many ways, we now have half the remaining wild vegetation on the planet left that was around 200-300 years ago,\" said Hopper, who will leave his position as chief executive and chief scientist at Kew Gardens in a few weeks, after six years at the top. \"It's really important for us to decide, as a global community, do we want to care for what remains and get into the business of repairing and restoring diversity? Or continue on the path of ever more incursions into wild places in the hope that human beings will be able to exploit resources and continue with a reasonable quality of life?\"</p> <p>Hopper said there were reasons to be optimistic, because people and institutions around the world had already demonstrated that conservation and restoration programmes could work in turning the tide against ecological degredation. All that was needed was to ramp up the speed and scale of the efforts, he said.</p> <p>\"All the indicators suggest that a new deal of some sort needs to occur with biodiversity and plant life in particular,\" said Hopper.</p> <p>Plants form the bulk of our everyday experience and they are the things we most often manipulate for human benefit, said Hopper. \"We can grow them, use them for food, medicine, shelter, culture, clothing \u2013 you name it. [Conservation] is something that has to grasp the hearts and minds of a significant majority of people in most nations. It's not a nice-to-do, it's a must-do.\"</p> <p>There are an estimated 400,000 species of plants on the Earth, compared to around 10,000 species of birds and around about 7,000 species of mammals. To get a handle on the conservation status of the world's flora, scientists at Kew worked with colleagues at the IUCN and the Natural History Museum in London to <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/search-rescue/mapping-plants/plants-at-risk/iucn-srli-explained/index.htm\" title=\"\">assemble information on a sample of known species</a>. Assessing all of the world's plant species would have been impossible but, by selecting key groups and several thousand species, the scientists got a robust handle on the state of plant diversity.</p> <p>\"One-third of the plant species we looked at, we didn't have enough data,\" said Hopper. \"Of the two-thirds for which we did have data, one-fifth of them were threatened in some way. We finally have reasonable statistics at a global level to understand the scale of the problem and it's formidable. Some 80,000 species on the planet at some risk of going extinct over the next 50-100 years.\"</p> <p>The pressures on plants come from a combination of human incursion into wild habitats, through agriculture and urbanisation, and also the direct effects of man-made climate change. The latter not only affects water availability but also plant life cycles. \"If you're a plant that produces annually, the timing of when you germinate can vary \u2013 you might not germinate at the right time and grow fast enough to be around when your pollinator's emerging if it's an insect, and you get into a reproductive spiral downwards,\" said Hopper.</p> <p>The physical changes brought by climate change were already showing how the environment was being pushed hard, he said.</p> <p>Agricultural plants themselves have also become worryingly limited. Hopper cited a 2000 study by scientists in the department of nutrition at the University of California, which <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19087432\" title=\"\">found that</a>, in recent centuries, humans have focused efforts on relatively few plant species with the result that 80% of total dietary energy intake, globally, is obtained from twelve domesticated species: eight cereals (barley, maize, millet, rice, rye, sorghum, sugar cane and wheat) and four tubers (cassava, potato, sweet potato and yam).</p> <p>There are ways to head off some of the problems. Projects such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2003/aug/21/plants.science\" title=\"\">Kew's Millenium Seed Bank</a> collect seeds from tens of thousands of species of plants and store them in cold, low humidity conditions. As such, these banks can serve as an ecological backup in case things go wrong in nature.</p> <p>There are also more direct moves afoot to restore damaged environments. In May, Kew Gardens partnered with botanic gardens in Chicago, Kings Park, New York and Missouri to <a href=\"http://www.kew.org/ucm/groups/public/documents/document/kppcont_054879.pdf\" title=\"\">restore degraded habitats</a>. Over the next 20 years, the alliance will work with 100 places that have been damaged or destroyed across six continents.</p> <p>Bruce Pavlik, head of restoration ecology at Kew Gardens said that healing the wounds that humans have inflicted on the planet will require a global, scientific effort. \"Botanic gardens have already begun the healing process, building native forests and rich grasslands on degraded earth, but their efforts are small in scale and woefully underfunded,\" he said. \"Forming a worldwide alliance [...] will spread the effort across six continents, training a new generation of practitioners, improving knowledge and techniques and producing restored ecosystems with high value to biodiversity and to human economies.\"</p> <p>In 2009, South Korea announced re-afforestation and river care plans, with the idea of creating a million jobs within five years. \"Some governments are starting to bite the bullet and starting, at scale, to make a difference,\" said Hopper.</p> <p>Maintaining plant diversity would also be important for future ecological health. \"People might say we don't need 400,000 species, we can just have a few plants and they'll provide the oxygen. There might some sense in that if the world was unchanging but the power of diversity - like cultural or intellectual diversity in humans - is all about a risk strategy in changing circumstances,\" said Hopper. \"You simply reduce your options if you say you'll deplete the diversity down to the lowest possible level.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Listen to the interview with Hopper in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/audio/2012/sep/03/science-weekly-podcast-wild-hopes-conservation\" title=\"\">this week's Science podcast</a></p>",
  "<p>Your 24 August issue neatly combines two interconnected issues. Agroforestry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/21/agroforestry-france-farming-revival\" title=\"\">(Planting the trees of life)</a> has long been a strategy practised by smallholder farmers in developing countries. One of the most interesting species being promoted is the so-called fertiliser tree (<em>Faidherbia albida</em>) which, as a legume, not only fixes atmospheric nitrogen, but also draws up essential nutrients. These are returned to the soil as organic matter when the tree that has provided shade throughout the dry season sheds its leaves. It not only fertilises the next crop but also offers no competition for light or water as other tree species do.</p> <p>For long-term sustainability, agroforestry must incorporate conservation practices and so when George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/poor-hungry-rich-drive-mo-farah-biofuels\" title=\"\">(Must the poor starve so the rich can drive?)</a> berates the practices of crop residue removal and ploughing grassland, he is on the right track as these are precisely the causes of our dependence on inorganic fertilisers, the destruction of soil biota, and soil erosion. This sort of conservation agriculture is desperately needed throughout the world.</p> <p>In his 17 August <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/05/ruralaffairs-birds\" title=\"\">Nature watch</a>, Mark Cocker lamented the calamitous fall in birds, mammals and insects in our contracting countryside and links it to our ostrich-like obsession with economic growth. All these strands were brought together for me when I recalled a farmer with whom I had worked in Central America. Together we had established tree species along the contours of his steeply sloping fields and these live barriers had checked soil erosion and had built up terraces where rainwater could accumulate. This was all well and permitted two crops a year instead of the usual one.</p> <p>But one of his comments is still with me several decades later. He said that the family had more food and could eat better but, for him, one of the joys was to sit in the shade of the trees that we had planted to watch and listen to the birds that enjoyed the insects, seeds and nesting sites provided. That is the sort of conservationist epiphany that could start us on the road of greater food production coupled with environmental protection. And that it is precisely what we are failing&#xa0;to do.<br><strong>Brian Sims</strong><br>Bedford, UK</p> <p>\u2022 Both George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/poor-hungry-rich-drive-mo-farah-biofuels\" title=\"\">(Must the poor drive so the rich can drive?)</a> and Jenna Woginrich <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/american-corn-feed-people-not-cars?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Feed people, not cars, 3 August)</a> see the issue of biofuels vs food in oversimplistic black-and-white terms.

Suppose for argument's sake that Washington does indeed intend to seek Assange's extradition from Sweden to face treason charges. What would it then be most rational for the US to be doing right now? Answer: giving the world \"no serious evidence\" of its intentions, since such evidence could serve only to strengthen international opposition to his being sent to Sweden. Since what they are doing now is exactly what they would be doing if they really did want to extradite him, it is absurd to cite what they are now doing as good reason to believe they have no intention to extradite him. Moreover, if Washington really has no such intention it could clear the air immediately by saying so \u2013 and thereby defuse an embarrassing situation for its ally Britain by removing Assange's only defensible reason for remaining in the Ecuadorean embassy.</p> <p>Overall, the more plausible reading of Washington's silence is that the US will be after him as soon as it can.</p> <p>The Swedish allegations against Assange are another matter. They are serious and warrant investigation. But that is not a good reason for misrepresenting the likelihood of US extradition proceedings, nor a good reason for sending Assange to Sweden regardless of that likelihood. Another way of investigating those allegations will need to be found. <br><strong>Christopher Cordner</strong><br>Melbourne, Australia</p> <p><strong>An issue of human rights</strong></p> <p>While the so-called massacre of South African miners was terrible and extremely regrettable, the police may have acted from fear for their own lives rather than brutal intentions, as seems to be suspected <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/17/miners-wives-rage-south-africa-killings?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Wives rage at brutality of Zuma's police after 'massacre' of miners, 24&#xa0;August)</a>.</p> <p>An unfair comparison your article seems to be making is that the protesters had only sticks while the police had guns.

I wonder what other options might be seen to have been open to the police other than to defend themselves with the weapons issued to riot police in South Africa.</p> <p>Police can hardly remain absent and leave aggressive mobs entirely to their own devices. That would be dereliction of duty. By the same token, it would be foolish in the extreme to attempt to defuse the anger of a large armed mob without adequate means of defence. Let's face it: it hardly seems necessary for workers to parade with lethal weapons to protest for better working conditions.<br><strong>Ian Cameron</strong><br>Auckland, New Zealand</p> <p>\u2022 Michael White's perceptive article regarding liberals looking away from the challenge of their preconceptions is not new in southern Africa <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/aug/20/south-africa-police-shootings\" title=\"\">(Blog: why do we choose to look away? 24 August)</a>. When, for example, the minority whites of Rhodesia controlled the country, they were internationally vilified by the liberals \u2013 in spite of having created one of Africa's most prosperous countries.</p> <p>The vilification was largely based on the oversimplistic concept of \"white bad, black good\" and ultimately resulted in Robert Mugabe taking power. One of his first actions in 1983 was to unleash the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade on the Ndebele tribes, resulting in the massacre of an estimated 20,000 people. At that time the liberals turned their faces away while muttering hollow platitudes about self-determination and periods of adjustment. Sadly an atrocity in which blacks had killed blacks did not conform to their racial preconceptions.</p> <p>The reprehensible shooting of the Marikana miners by their own police is not an issue of race \u2013 it is simply one of human rights, regardless of race, creed or skin colour.<br><strong>John Reynolds</strong><br>Auckland, New Zealand</p> <p><strong>Briefly</strong></p> <p>\u2022 As I read your piece enthusing about the imminent arrival of computer eyeglasses, I hoped it was a parody; but it seems that, alas, it was probably in earnest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/18/wearable-technology-vision-of-future?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(10 August)</a>.

  "<p>As part of UK prime minister David Cameron's cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday, Andrew Mitchell left the Department for International Development (DfID) \u2013 where he had been international development secretary for more than two years \u2013 to become chief whip.</p> <p>The former transport secretary, Justine Greening, will replace him.</p> <p>Mitchell, who held the post in the shadow cabinet prior to his 2010 appointment, said he was sad to be leaving the department, although, according to Guardian colleagues, chief whip is apparently a post he's always wanted.</p> <p>Mitchell has been widely praised for bringing greater transparency to the department's aid spending and upholding the UK government's commitment to keep its 0.7% aid pledge despite the tough economic climate and opposition from within his own party. DfID funding was ringfenced in the last comprehensive spending review.</p> <p>Mitchell has kept the UK's profile high among the donor community, and in June landed a job <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jun/29/andrew-mitchell-busan-aid-panel\" title=\"\">on a panel aimed at creating a new global partnership on development co-operation</a>. Moreover, it was on Mitchell's watch that Cameron was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/may/09/johnson-sirleaf-yudhoyono-cameron-development\" title=\"\">appointed co-chair of a UN high-level panel tasked with devising post-2015 development goals</a>.</p> <p>Cameron praised Mitchell's energy and commitment to the role. \"Andrew has done a superb job as Britain's development secretary,\" he said. \"He has made British development policy transparent, focused and highly effective. His energy and passionate commitment have placed Britain at the forefront of international efforts to improve the lives of millions of the world's poorest people. He has made a real difference.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, Mitchell has not been without his critics. Aid groups were unimpressed that, during his DfID tenure, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jun/16/aid-groups-broken-spending-pledge\" title=\"\">legislation to get the 0.7% pledge enshrined in statute was delayed until 2015</a>, two years later than outlined in the coalition agreement. Mitchell has also been criticised for focusing too strongly on targets and outcomes.</p> <p>On Twitter, reaction to the move has been one of general disappointment.</p> <p>Demented Bonxie tweeted: \"I'm not at all pleased that they've nicked Andrew Mitchell from DfID\", while Nigel Ellway wrote he was a \"damn good #DFID secretary\".</p> <p>Peter Guest was less gushing: \"Andrew Mitchell's gone from #DfID. Despite his habit of telling same story at every event, he was pretty knowledgeable.\"</p> <p>There was also some concern that Greening may choose to reverse the government's 0.7% aid pledge. NGOs will no doubt be stressing the importance of retaining the commitment.</p> <p>One person who clearly won't miss Mitchell, however, is Mehreen, who tweeted: \"Andrew Mitchell's insufferable, shrilly, monotone voice will be put to use as Chief Whip. Lots of cheers from the starving Africans #dfid\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://storify.com/gdndevelopment/reaction-to-cabinet-reshuffle-of-leadership-at-dfi.js\"> <script src=\"https://storify.com/gdndevelopment/reaction-to-cabinet-reshuffle-of-leadership-at-dfi.js\"></script><noscript>[<a href=\"http://storify.com/gdndevelopment/reaction-to-cabinet-reshuffle-of-leadership-at-dfi\" target=\"_blank\">View the story \"Reaction to cabinet reshuffle of leadership at DfID UK - in tweets \" on Storify</a>]</noscript> </figure>",
  "<p>David Cameron was finding, if he did not know already, how hard a cabinet reshuffle can be as he failed to persuade Iain Duncan Smith to leave work and pensions to run the justice department, and he battled for hours, eventually successfully, to prise Lady Warsi from the Conservative chairmanship to a new post in the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Cameron also found himself locked in a more gracious battle with Justine Greening after she was shifted from transport, a post she had held for 10 months. She was asked to take over international development.</p> <p>There were also suggestions that Jeremy Hunt, the surprise new health secretary, had been initially listed for the environment department.</p> <p>At least Ken Clarke, the veteran justice secretary, had the good grace to join the political departure lounge by agreeing to be the minister without portfolio with the right to advise on economics.</p> <p>Overall the reshuffle represents a clear shift if not quite a lurch to the right.</p> <p>The appointment of Chris Grayling, initially slated to take over work and pensions, as the new justice secretary could, alongside Hunt's promotion, turn out to be the most significant announcement of a less than seismic cabinet-level reshuffle. (More wide-scale changes will occur at more junior ministerial levels over the next 24 hours.)</p> <p>Despite his background at Channel 4 and as a former member of the SDP, Grayling knows how to please the party right, and he will take a tougher line on prisons, sentencing and the European convention. Clarke used to say: \"Theresa May locks them up and I let them out.\" That will no longer be quite the set-up.</p> <p>But Grayling, in the two and a half years left to him, will hardly have the money to start a big prison-building programme. He is more likely to take the payment-by-results model he had developed for the work programme at the Department for Work and Pensions and ensure it is used more widely in punishment in the community.</p> <p>He will also be more prepared to stage confrontations with the European court of human rights and the European Union. That will please Tory backbenchers eager to see some edge about national sovereignty.</p> <p>Grayling's departure also ensures that Duncan Smith will see his cherished universal credit model into implementation. But IDS has an iconic status in the Conservative party that will make it more difficult for George Osborne to secure a second round of big welfare cuts planned for next year. Expect to hear of threats of resignation.</p> <p>But the appointment of Hunt is the most outward-facing decision, designed to rebuild the government's credentials on the NHS after the disaster of the health bill. Cameron simply cannot afford to go into the 2015 election with the whole of the NHS opposed to or confused by his reforms. It marks a strong vote of confidence in Hunt, but his dismissal would have reflected on Cameron and his own relations with the Murdoch empire.</p> <p>Cameron will be relieved that Lansley, his former boss at Conservative central office, swallowed his pride to take up the post of leader of the House, a position that does not always signal the end of a political career, as Margaret Beckett found out when she was promoted to foreign secretary.</p> <p>Hunt's departure could also make the government response to the Leveson inquiry's conclusions more even-handed. Leveson's inquiry into media regulation is likely to result in radical proposals that the government will be minded to resist. A response from Hunt, rightly or wrongly, would be seen to be hopelessly tainted.</p> <p>Osborne, who retains his pre-eminent economic status as chancellor, will be pleased to see Owen Paterson as environment secretary, since he is likely to be open to a second round of relaxation of planning laws. Paterson leaves Northern Ireland with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/04/belfast-rioters-police-officers\" title=\"\">riots on the streets</a>. Osborne will be equally pleased to see Greening leave transport after 11 months, since she was likely to resist his support for a third runway at Heathrow, another key plank of his growth agenda.</p> <p>Grant Shapps, the new Conservative co-chairman, leaves the housing brief with plans laid for a big social housing programme, due to be announced this week. He will be a ubiquitous performer on TV, relieving some of the ridiculous load placed on Michael Fallon.</p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats there are no changes at cabinet level, but there are expected to be extensive lower-level changes, with David Laws joining forces with Michael Gove to claim clearer co-ownership of schools and social mobility policy.</p>",
  "<p>The new environment secretary, Owen Paterson, is set to be blooded in his new job by the start of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/badgers\">highly controversial badger cull</a> in England. Animals will be shot within weeks, unless ongoing legal challenges succeed in granting the creatures a stay of execution or the expected protests stall the marksmen. The cull aims to curb the scourge of tuberculosis in cattle and Paterson, when shadow environment secretary, wholeheartedly backed the farmers who support the cull, despite revealing that as a child he had kept an orphaned badger as a pet.</p> <p>That is the most pressing issue in his in-tray, though rising food prices and the alternating <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt?intcmp=239\">threat of floods</a> and droughts require urgent attention too - tricky given the huge budget cut his predecessor accepted for the department. </p> <p>But the most important issue is far broader: the fate of David Cameron's pledge to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\">make his government the \"greenest ever\"</a>. As the economy has tanked, the Tory right has looked to bury that pledge in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/21/environment-budget-2012-osborne-planning\">name of growth at any cost</a>.</p> <p>But environmental campaigners should prepare for deep disappointment: despite <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=132\">listing \"trees\" as an interest</a>, Paterson is no treehugger. In May, he reportedly told the Cabinet that it should <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/05/unemployment-is-down-exports-are-booming-but-paterson-hague-and-fox-all-urge-chancellor-to-do-more.html\">end all energy subsidies</a>, such as those for wind and solar power, and fast-track shale gas exploitation. He also urged more aviation capacity, which seems far more likely now Justine Greening - implacably opposed to a third runway at Heathrow has been removed. As MP for North Shropshire, Paterson has <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=132\">spoken against wind farms</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/newsshow.aspx?id=7&amp;ref=280\">new pylons needed to carry their power</a> to the national grid. </p> <p>His appointment marks a sharp lurch away from the green-minded policies which sheltered in the environment department and a significant weakening of the green voice at the Cabinet table. </p> <p>His predecessor, Caroline Spelman, presided over the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/17/forest-sell-off-abandoned-sorry-caroline-spelman\">disastrous attempt to sell-off England's publicly owned forests</a> and woodlands. But she spoke convincingly, if quietly, about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jun/02/uk-green-spaces-value\">value of the nation's natural environment</a> and the false economy of despoiling it in the desperate search for a quick fix to the recession. The responsibility for guarding the nation's natural capital now lies in Paterson's hands. </p> <p>Greens will not see those as safe. Paterson is seen as being on the right of the Conservative party - keen to deregulate and opposed to gay marriage, for example. And if you are tempted by omens, consider this: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Paterson\">Paterson's brother-in-law is apparently arch climate sceptic writer Matt Ridley</a>.</p> <p>Finally, a word on Spelman. Her dismissal to the backbenches is hardly a surprise after a difficult tenure which included the coalition government's first major U-turn - the reversal on the forestry sell-off - and the high profile troubles over the badger cull. Her trouble, in my opinion, began when she offered up a massive budget cut for her department in the comprehensive spending review, the biggest of any big ministry. Worst hit were the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt?intcmp=239\">nation's flood defences, whose funding plunged</a>. That may be a false economy that comes back to bite Paterson if one of the increasing number of floods hits a major city like Leeds or York. </p> <p>But Spelman clearly understood that a failure to tackle climate change and the loss of natural spaces and all the creatures that vanish with them will have a real cost for us all. Perhaps it was her conviction that sustainability is not optional - awkward for George Osborne and his growth-at-any-cost colleagues - that did for her, and not the forestry fuss.</p>",

  "<p>When Rim Ju-song was told earlier this year that he was going to be North Korea's first Paralympic athlete, competing as a swimmer, he was delighted. The fact that he barely knew how to swim did not trouble him unduly.</p> <p>\"I felt very proud and honoured to represent my country, so I did my best in the training,\" he said in an interview after the heats of the men's S6 50m freestyle race, in which he came 17th out of the 17 competitors, trailing 17.89sec behind the Cuban swimmer in first place.</p> <p>His appearance has been hailed as a landmark moment in North Korea, which has historically had a poor reputation among international disability organisations for its treatment of disabled people.</p> <p>North Korea's International Paralympic Committee (IPC) president, Kim Mun-chol, was among a large delegation from the country watching the race. Despite Rim's failure to get beyond the first heat, he congratulated him on his performance, acknowledging that the 16-year-old was new to the sport.</p> <p>\"Our swimmer had a short period to prepare for his participation in the Paralympic Games. His record shows that his spirit is very strong and it shows his devotion to the country. People with disabilities will be happy with his performance,\" he said.</p> <p>Media reports ahead of the race focused on North Korea's discriminatory treatment of disabled people, highlighting defectors' accounts of disabled people being housed in group homes or camps and kept out of the capital, Pyongyang, and other major cities. Both North Korea's IPC president and the team doctor firmly dismissed these accounts.</p> <p>Kim Mun-chol, speaking through a translator, said: \"That is not true. That is a story put out by people who do not understand our country. We have long paid attention to people with disabilities and with the participation in the Paralympic Games, activities for supporting disabled people will bloom in the future.</p> <p>\"The state has long been caring for the disabled, but since the creation of our protection of the disabled organisation in 1998, care of the disabled has improved so much.\"</p> <p>Kim Sung-chol, the team's doctor, added: \"I saw that report in the media. It is not true.\"</p> <p>He said sports opportunities for disabled people had begun to improve in the past few years, with disabled table tennis tournaments broadcast on television and new opportunities in boccia and powerlifting.</p> <p>\"When disabled people see him performing here, they get to know that there are events disabled people can participate in, so the environment will get better and better,\" he said.</p> <p>He also paid tribute to Rim's determination to learn competitive swimming in a very short period of time, pointing out that he had been obliged to start learning a second stroke only three weeks ago. Rim lost both his left arm and leg as a child. \"He was a naughty boy. He was playing in a construction site when he was six,\" the doctor said.</p> <p>Rim said he was surprised by the interest in his performance, and felt encouraged at the number of people cheering for him as he caught up with his fellow swimmers, most of whom had already finished as he passed the halfway mark.</p> <p>He said he was honoured to have been the country's first Paralympian and that he wanted to improve his performance so that he can take gold in Brazil in 2016.</p>",
  "<p>Mirroring the fact that games of every conceivable stripe exist, so do developers with every imaginable type of collective character. Guildford-based Media Molecule exists at the cuddliest, most approachable end of the developer spectrum, generally seeming to hover above what can be a hard-nosed, cynical scene.</p> <p>It made its reputation on the back of two iterations of the irresistibly endearing, yet wildly innovative, LittleBigPlanet, and at last at Gamescom it was ready to unveil a new intellectual property.</p> <p>Called Tearaway, and built exclusively for the PS Vita, it made a huge initial splash by appearing to combine the Arts &amp; Crafts-style cuteness of LittleBigPlanet with more conventionally structured action-platform gameplay. We managed to catch up with a group of Media Molecule's prime movers, and to snatch some precious hands-on time with Tearaway.</p> <p>Tearaway is clearly very much lead designer Rex Crowle's baby \u2013 so how would he describe it? \"It contains a lot of different concepts, but at its core it is an adventure game in which you guide this character called Iota, who is a messenger with a unique message for you in its head. And you are taking them through a paper world in order to get that message. But it's kind of a buddy-movie in that you, the player, are essentially a character in the game. You're a god-like being holding their whole world, and helping them on this adventure.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395628493\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346759546421/Tearaway2-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tearaway2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tearaway. By developer Media Molecule.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Stick your fingers in</h2> <p>When Media Molecule unveiled Tearaway at Sony's Gamescom press conference, two aspects stood out. First, as Crowle intimated, the entire game-world is made from paper, as is Iota, whose head is a slightly battered envelope. And second, it plays around with the concept of apparently real objects being able to enter the virtual world \u2013 for example, you will be able to apparently push your fingers, via the PS Vita's rear-touch panel, through the paper surface of the world, creating obstacles for Iota's Cyclops enemies.</p> <p>Dave Smith, Media Molecule technical director, gave an insight into the developer's mindset while describing Tearaway's initial starting point: \"It started off when we first got hands-on with the Vita and just wanted to see fingers pushing into a game-world, because it's something you can't do on any other device.</p> <p>\"I'm always frustrated with front-touch interaction \u2013 I feel like I'm pawing at this glass box and I can't actually get inside. And then we worked on how we could make an environment for that kind of interaction, and paper seemed the perfect medium because it's so tactile. And it can be very subtle or very dramatic, depending on what kind of influences you have. Then we went into more of a game-jam phase, which coalesced around the idea of you being this character outside of the world, and holding it.\"</p> <p>Crowle expands on the theme of sticking your fingers into Tearaway's world: \"When you try it, there really is an uncanny valley. Most people just play with it for 30 seconds, going: 'Hey, it's my finger'.\" He confirmed that there will be some kind of design-your-finger process before playing the game: \"There will be different shaders, different skin-tones, different types \u2013 female and male. One of the great things was when Dave angled the mesh, knowing where your hand would be. So if you configure it as right-handed or left-handed, the effect would be even better.\"</p> <h2>God-like powers</h2> <p>Media Molecule co-founder Alex Evans is keen to talk up the god-like-powers aspect of the game: \"The god-like powers have really developed through the game jam. Rather than coming up with a game that uses the PS Vita's capabilities just for the sake of it, it's a game which, from its inception, has been for the PS Vita. So every feature we use shouldn't just be a one-off gimmick; it should be woven into the gameplay, then also milked more and more. You'll go: 'Well that back-touch feeling was cool for the drum-skins, but now, on this section, I can use it in a new way, and I can combine it with whatever.' That's the result of a year of cooking by Rex and Dave, in a room they've marked The Secret Treehouse.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395628494\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346759673747/Tearaway3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tearaway3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tearaway. By developer Media Molecule.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Origami character design</h2> <p>Another endlessly appealing aspect of the game is that you can print out and make the origami-style paper animals you encounter in Tearaway. Evans says: \"I think that's really powerful. Some people will be crazily into it, and will build hundreds of these things. There are different ratings for models in the game \u2013 for example, a one-star rating, which would just be a single fold of paper. To take something from that game-world and have it left outside: that's a reminder of the adventure they had.\"</p> <p>Creative director Mark Healey adds: \"That's basically how all the concept art is done for the game \u2013 it's made physically.\" Crowle chips in with: \"I think everyone on the team has made something. The office has become more and more of a fire-hazard as we've been creating more of the world.\"</p> <p>Healey squares the circle: \"You can, for example, use the camera to capture textures \u2013 you can, for example, print out a paper elk, colour it and recapture it with the PS Vita. Because in the game you meet characters that go: 'Do you mind giving me a new skin \u2013 I'm feeling a bit bare?' That's just one link in the chain that takes you back and forth between the two worlds.\"</p> <h2>Hands-on</h2> <p>Before grabbing a PS Vita running the game, we asked whether it will be a single-path or open-world game. Crowle characterised it thus: \"It's not a level-to-level structure \u2013 there is a relatively condensed, rich world in which you can find some things that not everyone else has seen. But also there are some channelled areas where you need to use some more hardcore skills to get through. So you get a good blend of playfulness and slightly more sandboxy exploration, but then also some action-based areas.\"</p> <p>The area we sampled made quite heavy use of the PS Vita's rear-touch pad, with mainly platform-style gameplay. For the most part it involved manoeuvring Iota to seemingly inaccessible areas by moving him (with the left stick) onto drum-skins, which vibrated with a tap on the requisite area of the rear-touch pad, sending Iota into the air.</p> <p>Cleverly, Media Molecule explained that the PS Vita's accelerometers were also in play, so it could tell how hard you had tapped the rear touch-pad. And we also saw how gameplay conventions could evolve throughout Tearaway: another level saw Iota beset by Cyclops enemies, and the plan was to move him around to entice Cyclops onto drum-skins, so they could be propelled vertically into cages hanging above them.</p> <p>Tearaway will also use the PS Vita's front touch-screen, and its ability to sense tilting, and the (admittedly very early \u2013 the game is due at an unspecified time in 2013) impression we got was that while it may feel most like a platform game, that most enduring and venerable of genres, it will nevertheless be shot through with freshness and ingenuity, in a similar manner to Miyamoto epics like Super Mario Galaxy and 64. And when you finish it, Media Molecule promises that you will see Iota ascend from the virtual to the real world, so he can deliver the message in his head which, somehow, will be customised individually for everyone who plays the game.</p> <p>Tearaway could have been Media Molecule's Difficult Third Album, but it seems to have found the requisite inspiration lurking within the PS Vita.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Steve Boxer was taken to Gamescom by Sony</strong></p>",
  "<p>With the challenges of climate change and food and water security, there's never been a greater need for innovative, sustainable farming in the UK. But the industry is facing a severe shortage of new recruits. With the average age of a farmer at 58, <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/ farmersapprentice/careers/\" title=\"\">the Royal Agricultural Society of England (RASE) report</a> estimates the UK will need 60,000 new entrants over the next decade.</p> <p>One of the biggest obstacles for aspiring farmers is the cost \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/31/07/2012/134214/Farmland-prices-rise-around-the- world.htm\" title=\"\">especially the increasing price of farmland</a> \u2013 and most opportunities arise through succession or inheritance. Startup costs are also high.</p> <p>But there are encouraging signs. Demand for agricultural courses is increasing, reports <a href=\"http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Harper Adams University College</a>, which has experienced an 11% increase over the last five years, while the <a href=\"http://rac.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Agricultural College</a> has seen demand increase by 8% this year. Russell Readman, agriculture course manager at Harper Adams, explains that the industry is in a more buoyant mood; the key driver being the need to increase sustainable food production.</p> <p>Graduates from agricultural courses enjoy exceptionally high employment rates, with Harper Adams in <a href=\"http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/news/201689/harper- adams-in-top-three-for-graduate-employment\" title=\"\">the top three in the country</a>. Readman attributes this success to the year in industry all students undertake during their course, giving them exposure to the workplace and helping them gain key skills \u2013 both technical and interpersonal. Employer feedback is that these students have a can-do attitude, while \"the applied nature of the courses demonstrates principles in practice\".</p> <p>The diversity of opportunities in farming also contributes to the high employment rates, according to Readman, with the sector offering roles in both food production and ancillary services. It's also a global industry and many students find their transferable skills are useful abroad.</p> <p>So how can the farming sector attract potential recruits?</p> <h2><strong>Improved careers education and awareness</strong><br></h2> <p>Greater understanding of the range of opportunities would help dispel the myths that farming is low-skilled and low-paid. The general feeling is that more could be done in schools to promote farming as an aspirational career choice, and to make better links between subjects such as geography or chemistry and their applications in farming.</p> <h2><strong>Campaigns and initiatives</strong><br></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/communitysupportedagriculture\" title=\"\">Community supported agriculture</a> (CSA) can help encourage more people into farming by offsetting some of the costs. Farmers receive working capital for investment, and receive a higher return for produce. CSA initiatives can include box schemes, farm shops and farmers' markets, as well as many urban food growing projects, city farms and community gardens. In addition, they help to raise the status of farmers, and promote better links and understanding between rural and urban communities.</p> <p>Other campaigns such as the <a href=\"http://www.makinglocalfoodwork.co.uk/index.cfm\" title=\"\">Making Local Food Work</a> campaign which provides support to community food enterprises and organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.plunkett.co.uk/ whatwedo/communityfoodenterprises.cfm\" title=\"\">Plunkett Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sustainweb.org/\" title=\"\">Sustain</a> help to promote sustainable farming, while events such as <a href=\"http:// www.farmsunday.org/ofs12b/home.eb\" title=\"\">Open Farm Sunday</a> can improve understanding of food production, farming and the countryside.</p> <p>The Royal Agricultural College also invests in school and community events, through its Summer Schools and Field to Plate days (helping school students learn about food production, plant science and nutrition).</p> <h2><strong>Improved training and career progression routes</strong><br></h2> <p>Lantra, the Sector Skills Council supporting skills and training for people and businesses in the land-based sector, <a href=\"http://www.lantra.co.uk/Downloads/Research/Skills-assessment/UK- Skills-Assessment-Summary-Report-%282010-11%29.aspx\" title=\"\">reports that more effective strategies</a> for lifelong learning and professional development are necessary.</p> <p>With 94% of businesses employing fewer than 10 people, Lantra aims to increase awareness of training and business development. Improving the links between academic research and businesses can promote the innovation and technological change that farming needs to contribute to sustainability challenges.</p> <p>Apprenticeships are one part of this strategy. The number of these has doubled in the past three years, <a href=\"http://www.fwi.co.uk/Articles/27/02/2012/131636/VIDEO- Agricultural-apprenticeships.htm\" title=\"\">reports Farmers Weekly</a>, which has also launched its <a href=\"http://www.farmersapprentice.co.uk\" title=\"\">own Farmers Apprentice initiative</a> which aims to encourage young people without a background in farming to become farmers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://producerexchange.marksandspencer.com/news/ms-launches- farming-future-education-programme\" title=\"\">Farming for the Future</a> initiative, launched by Marks &amp; Spencer includes an education programme and provides training and development through bursaries, graduate placements within M&amp;S, scholarships for sustainable (or innovation) projects and postgraduate programmes.</p> <p>Establishing career progression routes would also make farming a more attractive career, says Will Frazer, from Farmers Weekly. Currently, the system tends to be \"haphazard\", with little recording of training or skills. He suggests that farming should also be challenged on how it recruits, focusing less on investment in machinery and more on top-quality graduates. Talent and skill must be rewarded if the industry is to recruit people with ambition and entrepreneurial spirit, he adds.</p> <h2><strong>Better PR</strong><br></h2> <p>Farming needs to offer more inspiring tales focusing on personality traits such as dedication, problem-solving and desire to be your own boss, as well as the satisfaction and personal rewards that can be gained from working in the sector.</p> <p>Stories that communicate these aspects of farming can also attract those who are tired of corporate values and who have the talent to make a positive social and environmental impact.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

The prime minister would like McLoughlin, a former miner and one of the government's few genuine working-class members, to become one of the Tories' main faces on the television.</p> <p>\u2022 Greening moves from transport to international development.</p> <p>\u2022 Maria Miller is promoted from minister for disabled people to enter the cabinet as culture secretary.</p> <p>\u2022 Theresa Villiers, the transport minister, is promoted to replace Owen Paterson as Northern Ireland secretary.</p> <p>\u2022 Paterson has been appointed secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, replacing Caroline Spelman, who has failed to recover from the fiasco of plans to sell off parts of the national forest.</p> <p>\u2022 Grant Shapps, the housing minister, becomes Conservative party chairman and has been appointed minister without portfolio, attending the cabinet.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, was appointed as chief whip on Monday to allow him to advise the prime minister on the reshuffle. Mitchell, known as \"Thrasher\", is a close ally of George Osborne.</p> <p>\u2022 Cheryl Gillan, the Welsh secretary, will leave the cabinet, to be replaced by David Jones. In a sign of what was being dubbed the first Twitter reshuffle, Gillan removed the description of herself as secretary of state for Wales from her personal Twitter profile before the move was announced. Jones, the Wales Office minister and MP for Clwyd West, then tweeted: \"Well I'll be darned.\" When the ITN newsreader Alastair Stewart noticed, Jones tweeted: \"@alstewitn slip of the thumb. Was supposed to be a DM in reply to a friend.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, who hopes to announce his new cabinet by Tuesday afternoon, is saying that only those who can play a decisive role in the next \"delivery phase\" of the government can expect to keep their places in the cabinet.</p> <p>Clarke played down his demotion and said he had always agreed he would only do a \"couple of years\" running a major department. He said his new role would give him a focus on the economy and national security council.</p> <p>\"I never thought I would be back in the government in the first place,\" Clarke told the BBC. \"At my age you do occasionally have to step down from a heavy departmental role before you suddenly realise you can no longer handle it.\"</p> <p>The appointment of Mitchell, a whip under John Major, who had made no secret of his ambition to become chief whip, shows the influence of Osborne. \"George gets his chief whip,\" said one senior Tory. Mitchell formed an alliance with the future chancellor while they ran rival campaigns during the 2005 Tory leadership contest.</p> <p>Mitchell, who managed David Davis's campaign, invited Osborne to dinner at his country house during the contest.</p> <p>Osborne, who was identified as the most unpopular member of the government in a recent Guardian/ICM poll, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/03/george-osborne-booed-paralympics\" title=\"\">booed when he awarded medals at the Olympic Stadium</a> on Monday night. By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/04/cameron-reshuffle-government-politics-live#block-5045afa358f923c82113b862\" title=\"\">Gordon Brown was cheered</a> when he appeared at the Aquatics Centre.</p> <p>One government source said: \"The prime minister sees the second half of this parliament as the delivery phase. We want to have people who have a proven record in delivering in their departments.\"</p> <p>David Laws, the former Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, is set to return as an education minister. He may also have a roving policy brief across government. Jo Swinson, Nick Clegg's parliamentary private secretary, is also expected to be promoted.</p> <p>Cameron, who knows reshuffles can turn into Westminster soap operas that often go wrong, hopes to ensure the main message of the week will be about delivery and fresh policies to promote economic growth. The prime minister and Nick Clegg are due to make a joint appearance to give details of bills to provide a basis for \u00a340bn to guarantee infrastructure projects and \u00a310bn for house building.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"As chief whip, Andrew will ensure strong support for our radical legislative programme, by working hard to win the argument in the Commons as well as playing a big role in the No 10 team. He will be invaluable as the government embarks on the next, vital phase of its mission to restore our economy to growth and reform our public services.\"</p> <p>Mitchell said: \"It has been a huge privilege to serve as part of a coalition which has radically overhauled the way aid is spent and brought a new rigour to British development policy. I am incredibly proud to be part of a government which is improving the lives of the world's most vulnerable people and helping the poorest countries stand on their own two feet. I leave [the Department for International Development] with great sadness but I very much look forward to the task ahead.\"</p>",

For the Guardian, Shiv Malik reports:<br>At present, those claiming ESA who have also been deemed fit to eventually return to work after controversial health assessments run by the private firm and Paralympic sponsor Atos can only be docked a maximum of \u00a328.15 a week if they break their agreement with their job advisers without \"good cause\".<br>But the draft letter, expected to be sent to all those in the ESA work-related activity group (Wrag), says that from 3 December the penalty will jump to \u00a371 a week out of a maximum allowance award of \u00a399.15.<br>On the Where's the Benefit blog, David G writes that <a href=\"http://wheresthebenefit.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/disabled-people-told-to-do-workfare-or.html\" title=\"\">the reality for disabled people may be even scarier than the headlines</a>. He says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I've claimed both JSA and ESA in the past, and I'm currently claiming neither and living on my rapidly evaporating savings because of the damage both of those, but in particular the ATOS-run WCA test for ESA, have done to my health. Having entered the process with a physical disability I now face panic attacks any time I try to deal with official, or potentially official, mail. What that means in the context of these latest headlines is that I have actually been through the process of setting up a work plan, and that is what worries me.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Journalist Kate Belgrave is travelling the country to track the impact of spending cuts. She's posted the <a href=\"http://www.katebelgrave.com/2012/08/schizophrenia-little-support-and-fit-for-work-that-doesnt-exist/\" title=\"\">transcript of a recent interview</a> with a man in his 50s who was diagnosed with schizophrenia nearly 30 years ago and has recently been found fit for work. He told Belgrave:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The way I feel varies. Some days I just can't be bothered to get out of bed \u2013 I just feel so low. Sometimes, that goes and I physically can't get out of bed. Even the GP reckoned years ago that I couldn't handle stress very well, so he was very surprised when I went to university. I always got a bit of extra time, because they were very good \u2013 they acknowledged that I had difficulties and they worked around them. I just wish employers would, because I reckon that I'll be found fit for work again. It's got to be limited \u2013 it's got to be limited travel, no more than 20 hours a week and less than an hour a day travel, but beggars can't be choosers, I'm afraid. <br>... I would hate to think where I'd be in six months' time without support. I think I would be back in hospital at the very least, if not on my deathbed. It's been a constant struggle anyway, with what limited support I get and I'm trying to get more, but if I didn't have what I've got I think it'd be even worse and I think I'd be on far more medication.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Coincidentally, Atos Healthcare and work capability assessment are the subject of a parliamentary debate today, follow it on Twitter via the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/?q=%23WCADebate&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#WCAdebate</a></p> <p>\u2022 The <strong>cabinet reshuffle</strong>.

There are 25 miles of footpaths around the estate, which is National Trust-owned, and you can do as much or as little as you like.

  "<p>What if members of the United States Congress, now returning from their summer recess, were to receive a \"back to school\" letter from concerned citizens? Here is what a first draft might look like.</p> <h2>Dear Member of Congress:</h2> <p>Welcome back to the Capitol. We hope that you had a good summer break, and that you return to Washington not just rested, but also energised to take on our country's mounting economic challenges.</p> <p>The news has been mixed during your absence. We have seen some improvement in economic data, but not enough to suggest that we are any closer to overcoming decisively this painful period of low growth and high unemployment. And, with a self-inflicted fiscal cliff looming \u2013 one that could send our country back into recession, pulling the rest of the world with us \u2013 businesses are reluctant to hire and invest in new capital goods. Fortunately, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/31/markets-fed-chairman-ben-bernanke?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Federal Reserve has signalled its intention to remain active</a>, but its policy tools are poorly suited to the challenges that we face.</p> <p>Meanwhile, global difficulties remain substantial. We continue to face strong headwinds originating from the deepening European debt crisis, as well as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. China, once the world's unstoppable growth engine, is slowing. And, despite all the happy talk, multilateral policy co-ordination is essentially non-existent.</p> <p>All of this calls for courageous and visionary economic leadership; otherwise, our problems will fester and grow, and the solutions will become even more complex. Already, too many of our economy's difficulties, including worrisome trends in youth joblessness and long-term unemployment, risk becoming structurally embedded.</p> <p>No doubt you have also noticed that, with less than 10 weeks to go until the November presidential election, our country is in the grip of an increasingly ugly political campaign. So, with this combination of bad economics and bad politics, we look to you for direction and leadership. It is that simple, and that important.</p> <p>We need you to overcome a prolonged period of congressional paralysis and polarisation in order to address the country's malaise. We need you to pivot in your responses from the tactical to the strategic, from the cyclical to the secular, from the partial to the comprehensive, and from sequential to simultaneous reforms.</p> <p>If this call to national duty is not enough, we would remind you of your own self-interest. According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, your support among us, the electorate, stands at just 12%.</p> <p>We concede that there is no magic wand to overcome our country's problems. After all, for too many years leading up to the global financial crisis, America \"bought\" and \"borrowed\" its growth by leveraging balance sheets, rather than \"earning\" it through increased competitiveness. The result was massive misallocation of human resources, insufficient infrastructure investment, over-reliance on credit entitlements, and, of course, unsustainable debt. To make matters worse, this occurred at a time when systemically important emerging economies hit their \"developmental breakout phase,\" powered by trade and other aspects of globalisation.</p> <p>We do not expect you to solve America's problems overnight. Instead, we look to you to embark on an appropriate and sustainable policy path. So, as you unpack your bags and renew old friendships and rivalries, please keep the following in mind.</p> <p>Changing course requires that you, together with the president, have a much more open and consistent economic dialogue with us, the general public, about the challenges that we face. It also requires that you and the president converge on a multi-prong, multi-year policy initiative that, at a minimum, makes simultaneous advances in six critical areas:</p> <p>\u2022 Fiscal reform: We desperately need you to eliminate the looming fiscal cliff in the context of medium-term reforms of both the tax system and entitlements. This would also allow for greater fiscal stimulus at a time when other components of aggregate demand are slowing.</p> <p>\u2022 Labour-market reform: Persistently high unemployment and large-scale withdrawal from the labour force are a constant reminder of a malfunctioning labour market that needs support through better training and retooling. Reform must also address the related challenges of a lagging education system and an insufficient social safety net.</p> <p>\u2022 Housing and housing finance: At the root of the global financial crisis, the troubled US housing market continues to act as a millstone around the economy's neck. The longer the problems persist, the greater the pressure on consumer and business sentiment, and the harder it is for the unemployed to find and relocate to new job opportunities.</p> <p>\u2022 Clogged credit pipes: With banks' balance sheets contracting, too many small and medium-size companies are unable to mobilise credit for investment and growth. Recognising that it will take years until banks are properly stabilised, America needs to build new conduits for credit.</p> <p>\u2022 Infrastructure: Those of you who have travelled abroad know that our infrastructure is desperately lagging that of a growing number of countries. This makes it even harder for our companies to compete and prosper.</p> <p>\u2022 Global policy co-ordination: America's traditional leadership role has evaporated in recent years as our problems have made us more insular and inward-looking. This would not be a major problem if the resulting vacuum had been filled. But that has not happened. On the contrary, the G7 has lost relevance, the International Monetary Fund is hampered by its representation and legitimacy deficits, and the G20 is still finding its feet.</p> <p>Engineering such an agenda is not an overwhelming challenge. But that will provide little comfort if you, our elected representatives, do not collaborate effectively.</p> <p>The choice Congress faces this term is simple: either address head on America's challenges, or risk being remembered as the body whose dithering condemned future generations to being worse off than their parents.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Concerned citizens</p> <p>__________________________________________________________</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012</p>",
  "<p>Nestl\u00e9, the world's largest food company, has added its weight to calls by the UN and development groups for the US and EU to change their biofuel targets because of looming food shortages and price rises.</p> <p>\"We say no food for fuel,\" said Paul Bulcke, chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, at the end of the <a href=\"http://www.worldwaterweek.org/\" title=\"\">World Water Week conference in Sweden</a>. \"Agricultural food-based biofuel is an aberration. We say that the EU and US should put money behind the right biofuels.\"</p> <p>Under laws intended to reduce foreign oil imports, 40% of US maize (corn) harvest must be used to make biofuels, even though one of the deepest droughts in the past 100 years is expected to reduce crop yields significantly. In addition, EU countries are expected to move towards drawing 10-20% of their energy supply for transport from biofuels to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>But Nestl\u00e9, which has 470 food factories around the world and 25% of the world's bottled water market, says clean economy and US energy independence should not be pursued at the expense of food supplies or massive price increases.</p> <p>\"[Using biofuels] was well-intentioned at the time, but when you have better information then you have to be coherent,\" said Bulcke. \"You have to know when to say: 'Stop here'. Now we see, too, that the carbon [reduction] element of biofuels is not as clear as it was intended to be.\"</p> <p>Bulcke said Nestl\u00e9 had lobbied the US and EU governments to change their quotas. \"We have said [it] to [the] US government, but politically it's hard. We are an important food company and, yes, we do have a voice. We try to be vocal with our convictions.\"</p> <p>He argued water is the world's coming crisis because, without better use of it, food supplies \u2013 which the UN predicts must increase around 50% in the next 40 years \u2013 will be severely limited.</p> <p>\"The relationship between food and water is clear,\" said Bulcke. \"Water should have a value. There is so much much waste in the system. Upstream on farms, industry, food waste, food spoilage. Agriculture is responsible for 70% of all water being used globally, and 90% in some developing countries.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/26/food-shortages-world-vegetarianism\" title=\"\">Water is one cause of the food crisis</a>. Governments took their eyes off the ball. For years, research and development investments were very low, at 1.5% annually. We have a crisis in the making. We cannot continue to use water in the same wasteful way as before.</p> <p>\"What is environmentally unsustainable today will become socially unsustainable in a not so distant future,\" added Bulcke. \"We risk up to 30% shortfalls in global cereal production due to water shortage by 2025. It seems as if we will have to go through a massive global crisis before becoming aware that we cannot leave a paradox of this importance unresolved.</p> <p>\"The main challenge \u2013 water for farming \u2013 is also the main opportunity. Saving potentials in agriculture are still huge; physiological needs of plants amount to only 40-50% of actual withdrawals today. And there are more savings of water possible further down the value chain.\"</p> <p>According to Nestl\u00e9, which operates in 86 countries and is the world's most profitable corporation, it is moving strongly to conserve water, both by helping farmers save waste by growing crops that need less, and by improving factory efficiency. It has also lowered its milk wastage dramatically, effectively saving its per-dollar water use, which has been reduced from 4.5 litres in 2002 to 1.5 litres today.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/about/director-gen/en/\" title=\"\">UN FAO director general Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva</a> said suspension of the [biofuel] quota would allow more of the crop to be diverted for food production. \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/85a36b26-e22a-11e1-b3ff-00144feab49a.html#axzz25QshF363\" title=\"\">The worst drought for 50 years is inflicting huge damage on the US maize crop, with serious consequences for the overall international food supply</a>,\" he wrote in the Financial Times.</p>",
  "<p>Tasmanian devils must evolve to be less aggressive if they are to avoid becoming extinct, suggests new research.</p> <p><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02025.x/abstract\" title=\"\">The study</a> sheds new light on an infectious cancer threatening to wipe out the species' wild population, which only exists on the Australian island of Tasmania. The tumours caused by the devastating disease, known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), interfere with feeding and affected animals often starve to death.</p> <p>Rodrigo Hamede and his team at the University of Tasmania investigated the connection between the infection of DFTD, which is spread when one animal bites another, and the number of bites that an animal received.</p> <p>They found that devils with fewer bites \u2013 the more aggressive ones \u2013 were more likely to develop the disease. \"Our results, that devils with fewer bites are more likely to develop DFTD, were very surprising and counterintuitive,\" said Hamede. \"In most infectious diseases there are so-called super-spreaders, a few individuals responsible for most of the transmission. But we found the more aggressive devils, rather than being super-spreaders, are super-receivers.</p> <p>\"This means that more aggressive devils do not get bitten as often, but they bite the tumours of the less aggressive devils and become infected,\" said Hamede.</p> <p>They hypothesise that evolution should favour less aggressive types of devil, which could reduce the rate of transmission of the disease.</p> <p>\"We are hoping that there will be some sort of co-evolution towards coexistence between the devil and the disease,\" said Hamede, whose work was published in the Journal of Animal Ecology on Monday. \"There may be some indication that devils can somehow learn to behave in a way that makes them less susceptible to acquiring the disease.\"</p> <p>The team caught devils using traps over a period of three years and recorded any pattern of injuries and any tumours they could observe.</p> <p>Understanding the behavioural and ecological circumstances associated with the transmission of DFTD is the key to controlling its spread in devil populations. There is no treatment for, or vaccine against, DFTD.</p> <p>Since it was first identified in 1996, sightings of the Tasmanian devil have declined by more than 80%. As of 2009, the Tasmanian devil has been <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/40540/0\" title=\"\">listed as endangered on the IUCN red list</a>, the benchmark for the global conservation status of plant and animal species.</p> <p>DFTD is one of only two infectious cancers in the world, the other one is the canine transmissible venereal tumour in domestic dogs. DFTD, however, is the only one to be considered 100% fatal. It is a clonal disease which means that the same cancerous cell line developed in a single Tasmanian devil 15-20 years ago and has survived by direct transmission between the devils.</p>",

In Kenya most people would never even consider that we have any potential, aspirations or talents. </p> <p>The employer interviewing us for jobs, the teachers in schools, the bank manager considering whether to give us a loan for business, even the parents deciding whether to spend money sending their disabled child to school \u2013 few will see us as equals. Our former President Moi this month denounced the appointment of a highly educated, experienced blind public servant to an important government commission because he 'cannot see' the issues. Many agree with him.</p> <p>This prejudice denies many the tools we'd need to escape poverty; consider that 80% of the world's disabled live in poverty, and most estimates state over 90% of children with disabilities in the developing world <a href=\"http://portal.unesco.org/education/en/ev.php-URL_ID=32969&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html\">do not go to school</a>.

We had parents who believed in us and encouraged us to aim high. My Dad has told me of the many questions he was asked by friends and family on his decision to support my education. He could have invested all his time and money on my siblings, as they thought I was not a good enough investment venture due to my disability.</p> <p>We work with AbleChildAfrica to give other young people with disabilities the same encouragement, aspiration and opportunities we were lucky enough to receive.

They can then graduate to internships or receive support to develop a business plan and access start-up credit. Over 100 members have now gone through the programme. </p> <p>The stigma is reducing as the participants are recognised in their communities for more than their disabilities; as athletes, entrepreneurs, and professionals ranging from civil servants to IT specialists.</p> <p>We did not think that we would be selected to carry the torch.

  "<p>One quarter of Liberia's land has been sold to logging companies in just two years, threatening the country with widespread devastation, according to a report.</p> <p>A new spate of logging contracts in Liberia \u2013 the most heavily forested country in west Africa \u2013 means that 40% of its forests are under private ownership and risk being flattened by logging companies, says the report. Companies have used what campaigners describe as a legal loophole to buy unlimited swaths of private land with the intention of logging and clearing forests through the use of private use permits (PUPs).</p> <p>\"Private use permits are great news for logging companies. They are very bad news for pretty much everybody else in Liberia,\" said Robert Nyahn of Save My Future Foundation. \"Some communities will receive less than 1% of their timber's value, while very little revenue will reach state coffers.\"</p> <p>The report, by environmental watchdogs Global Witness, Save My Future Foundation and the Sustainable Development Institute, claimed PUPs had been given to private companies without consulting local groups and in some cases using forged documents.</p> <p>\"People being defrauded out of their forest rights at this speed and scale is worrying in itself. When you look at who the forests have been given to, it gets even more alarming,\" said Jonathan Gant, of Global Witness. \"Giving your forests to companies like that is not a sustainable investment.\"</p> <p>The contracts allow landowners to enter into agreements directly with logging companies, bypassing strict laws on sustainability and size limits. The groups behind the report also claim that land owned on behalf of communities has been given away with little or no consent, prompting suggestions that land deeds had been forged.</p> <p>Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, has announced she has suspended the head of the forestry development authority, Moses Wogbeh, and launched an investigation.</p> <p>\"President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf has commissioned an independent body to conduct a comprehensive review of the policies and procedures regarding the issuance of PUPs,\" said a statement from the office of the president last week.</p> <p>Johnson Sirleaf \u2013 a former World Bank economist and Nobel prize laureate \u2013 has faced mounting allegations of corruption among senior officials in recent months. Last month, she suspended her son Charles Sirleaf from his position as deputy central bank governor after he failed to declare his assets to the country's anti-corruption commission. Two of Johnson Sirleaf's other sons continue to hold positions in government.</p> <p>The new findings about the extent of PUPs will come as a further blow to Johnson Sirleaf's leadership, campaign groups say, and undermine the reform to Liberia's forestry sector since the end of the country's 14-year resource-fuelled civil war in 2003, which was characterised by the use of timber exports by the then Liberian president, Charles Taylor, to finance arms.</p> <p>Experts estimate that $30m (\u00a318m) has been spent by donors to ensure a legal process for granting logging concessions since the end of Liberia's war, and to help communities better manage their forest reserves.</p> <p>A UN ban on Liberian logging was lifted in 2006, and the country resumed exports of timber in 2010 under new forestry regulation that drew praise from the international community.</p> <p>However, land reform \u2013 one of the issues identified by Liberia's truth and reconciliation commission's final report as a cause of the war \u2013 has not yet happened, and is regarded as a threat to peace in the country.</p> <p>Liberians said that the reaction to news of the PUPs by Johnson Sirleaf and the Liberian Timber Association \u2013 a local trade association that has filed complaints with both the Liberian senate and supreme court \u2013 did not go far enough.</p> <p>\"Recent statements by President Johnson Sirleaf are promising, but the response of the Liberian Timber Association is a major concern,\" said Silas Siakor, of the Sustainable Development Institute. \"Too frequently, those who abuse Liberia's natural resources have not been held to account. If Liberia's forests and the people who depend upon them are not to be swallowed whole by Private Use Permits then the suspension of logging operations must stand this time and a comprehensive independent investigation must be undertaken.\"</p> <p>Global Witness said: \"Since the end of Liberia's war we have worked with the government and international partners like the United States, the EU and the World Bank to ensure the Liberian people get sustainable benefits from their forests. These Private Use Permits severely undermine these reform efforts.\"</p>",

As Offa has rightly signalled in the past, long term outreach which boosts aspiration and attainment is the most effective way of putting potential students in strong positions to apply to selective universities.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.1994group.ac.uk/documents/public/Publications/Widening%20Participation%20through%20targeted%20outreach%20programmes%20policy%20brief.pdf\" title=\"\">We believe in targeted outreach</a> at the 1994 Group and the approach is paying dividends: while on the whole <a href=\"http://www.offa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Sir-Martin-Harris-Fair-Access-report-web-version.pdf\" title=\"\">progress on widening participation has remained largely flat in selective institutions</a>,between the academic years 2005-6 and 2010-11, members of the 1994 Group on average improved their figures for the three main <a href=\"http://www.hesa.ac.uk/content/view/2072/141/\" title=\"\">HESA widening participation performance indicators</a> by several percentage points in each category.</p> <p>We've been looking into some of the reasons for this, collecting evidence and case studies from staff and students from across our institutions to identify best practice in outreach. Our findings supported Offa's belief that well-targeted outreach that begins early on in life works best. The broader message from our students: it would be na\u00efve to try and model the motivations of prospective students \u2013 many of those we spoke to faced very different barriers before attending university. Maintaining a portfolio of outreach activities was seen as crucial to responding to diverse needs and concerns, as was ensuring that these programmes are carefully targeted towards individuals who need the most support.</p> <p>The key task for Offa going forward is not to identify the best types and methods of outreach, but to ensure that the infrastructure which supports outreach activity across the sector is sound, as well as advocating for the policy environment which surrounds it. It won't be easy. The practitioners we spoke to identified three main barriers to making substantial progress on outreach.</p> <p>First, the lack of a joined-up monitoring and data framework is not helping. It is almost impossible for universities to assess the impact of particular outreach initiatives on any significant scale, as contact with participants is too easily lost if they change school or attend another university. Integrating the <a href=\"http://http://www.learningrecordsservice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">unique learner number</a> into this system would be one way to better track the outcomes of participants, as would tracking <a href=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/free_school_meals_fsm\" title=\"\">free school meal data</a> and enabling greater links between university data and the <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/researchandstatistics/national-pupil-database\" title=\"\">National Pupil Database.</a></p> <p>Second, there is no reliable geographical picture of outreach coverage across the country. This has lead to a dual problem of duplicated efforts and widening participation 'blind spots', mainly in rural areas with limited access to large, urban universities. Though it could have been more effective, the <a href=\"http://www.aimhigher.ac.uk/sites/practitioner/home/\" title=\"\">Aimhigher initiative</a> did at least bring about better geographical co-ordination of efforts and a vacuum has been left in its wake.</p> <p>Third, increasing competitive pressures on recruitment are making it extremely difficult for institutions to engage in collaborative activities at the 16+ level. The loss of Aimhigher has also created a need for a neutral centralised mechanism for collaboration, and OFFA would do well to consider what is needed to fill this gap.</p> <p>A fit-for-purpose outreach framework offers the best road to creating a more diverse student population without forfeiting academic standards. Taking steps to ensure that the conditions are in place for such a framework would enable you to have a truly 'nuclear' impact on the sector, allowing universities to open the doors to talented students from an ever widening range of backgrounds.

Warsi will speak to the prime minister on Tuesday morning after considering her position overnight. She tweeted: \"It's been a privilege and an honour to serve my party as co-chairman, signing off as @ToryChairman, signing on @sayeedawarsi.\"</p> <p>Warsi's cabinet seat as minister without portfolio is to be taken by Kenneth Clarke, who is also demoted. Clarke, who had fought to keep his post as justice secretary with the strong support of Nick Clegg, will have a roving brief on the economy.</p> <p>In other changes:</p> <p>\u2022 Sir George Young, 71, a close ally of Clarke's on the \"one nation\" wing of the Tory party, is to lose his post as leader of the House of Commons.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Lansley is expected to lose his post as health secretary. Lansley left the prime minister in despair when he struggled to explain the need for his plans to devolve most of the NHS's \u00a3100bn budget to new GP-led commissioning groups.</p> <p>\u2022 Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, is expected to leave. Spelman has failed to recover from the fiasco of plans to sell off parts of the national forest.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, was appointed as chief whip on Monday to allow him to advise the prime minister on the reshuffle. Mitchell, known as \"Thrasher\", is a close ally of George Osborne.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrick McLoughlin, the outgoing chief whip, is expected to be promoted to a full cabinet post as transport secretary. The prime minister would like McLoughlin, a former miner and one of the government's few genuine working-class members, to become one of the Tories' main faces on the television</p> <p>\u2022 Cheryl Gillan, the Welsh secretary, will leave the cabinet. In a sign of what was being dubbed the first Twitter reshuffle, Gillan removed the description of herself as secretary of state for Wales from her personal Twitter profile.</p> <p>David Jones, the Wales Office minister and MP for Clywd West who has been tipped as a possible replacement for Gillan, then tweeted: \"Well I'll be darned.\" When the ITN newsreader Alastair Stewart noticed, Jones tweeted: \"@alstewitn slip of the thumb. Was supposed to be a DM in reply to a friend.\"</p> <p>The prime minister, who hopes to announce his new cabinet by Tuesday afternoon, is saying that only those who can play a decisive role in the next \"delivery phase\" of the government can expect to keep their places in the cabinet.</p> <p>The ministers summoned to see the prime minister on Monday night were told by the prime minister they were to be sacked or demoted. \"If you are seen first you are down or out,\" one veteran said. \"The first meetings are about freeing up spaces in the cabinet.\"</p> <p>Friends of Clarke, who announced he was heading off for his traditional curry after his meeting with the prime minister, said it would be a mistake to move the veteran former chancellor. \"Ken is presiding over some of the biggest cuts in government \u2013 to prisons and to legal aid. But he has neutralised the Prison Officers' Association and you hardly hear a pip out of the barristers. The prime minister will regret it if Ken goes,\" they said.</p> <p>The appointment of Mitchell, a whip under John Major who has made no secret of his ambition to become chief whip, shows the influence of George Osborne. \"George gets his chief whip,\" said one senior Tory. Mitchell formed an alliance with the future chancellor while they ran rival campaigns during the 2005 Tory leadership contest.</p> <p>Mitchell, who managed David Davis's campaign, invited Osborne to dinner at his country house during the contest.</p> <p>Osborne, who was identified as the most unpopular member of the government in a recent Guardian/ICM poll, was booed when he awarded medals at the Olympic Stadium on Monday night. By contrast, Gordon Brown was cheered when he appeared at the Aquatics Centre.</p> <p>One government source said: \"The prime minister sees the second half of this parliament as the delivery phase. We want to have people who have a proven record in delivering in their departments.\"</p> <p>Cameron also wants to bring into the cabinet in junior roles what is being described as a \"new generation of MPs\". Maria Miller, the minister for disabled people, is likely to join the cabinet.</p> <p>Members of the 2010 intake of MPs will be promoted into government, though not into the cabinet. \"There will be fresh blood into the cabinet,\" one source said.</p> <p>David Laws, the former Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, is set to return as an education minister. He may also have a roving policy brief across government. Jo Swinson, Nick Clegg's parliamentary private secretary, is also expected to be promoted.</p> <p>Cameron, who knows reshuffles can turn into Westminster soap operas that often go wrong, hopes to ensure the main message of the week will be about delivery and fresh policies to promote economic growth. The prime minister and Nick Clegg are due to make a joint appearance to give details of bills to provide a basis for \u00a340bn to guarantee infrastructure projects and \u00a310bn for house building.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister told MPs the decision to abandon reform of the House of Lords had cleared a space in the calendar to rush through the bills. \"The prime minister and I will be making some announcements shortly on how we will use this opportunity of a gap, an unexpected gap in the legislative timetable, in order to push forward things which will help to create growth and jobs in our economy,\" Clegg said.</p> <p>Mitchell will have his dream job. \"This is the man who has always wanted to be chief whip,\" one Tory said. \"Andrew has modelled himself on Francis Urquhart.\" That reference is to the chief whip played by the late Ian Richardson in the television series House of Cards, whose catchphrase was: \"You might very well think that; I couldn't possible comment.\"</p> <p>Cameron said: \"As chief whip, Andrew will ensure strong support for our radical legislative programme, by working hard to win the argument in the Commons as well as playing a big role in the No 10 team. He will be invaluable as the government embarks on the next, vital phase of its mission to restore our economy to growth and reform our public services.\"</p> <p>Mitchell said: \"It has been a huge privilege to serve as part of a coalition which has radically overhauled the way aid is spent and brought a new rigour to British development policy. I am incredibly proud to be part of a government which is improving the lives of the world's most vulnerable people and helping the poorest countries stand on their own two feet. I leave [the Department for International Development] with great sadness but I very much look forward to the task ahead.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Norfolk and Suffolk police authorities took the decision to collaborate and build six new custody centres \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.norfolk.police.uk/newsevents/newsstories/2011/november/newinvestigationcentreopens.aspx\" title=\"\">Police Investigation Centres (PICs)</a> \u2013 last February, it presented a considerable challenge and a huge opportunity.</p> <p>With all old custody facilities to be decommissioned, many officers would have had to take their arrests further, to unfamiliar buildings and often across county borders. However, the new PIC buildings gets around the problem and have been excellently received, offering plenty of capacity with bright and airy conditions for both detainees and staff.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/press-releases/hmi-prisons/police-custody-in-norlfork-and-suffolk-joint-working-strikingly-successful\" title=\"\">So how did we make the best of this new environment?</a> Our approach could be summed up in three words: efficiency, consistency and familiarity.</p> <p>Our existing custody suites all had different processes. Often this was due to the limitations of the buildings they were in but also because of independent cultures that had developed over many years. In our case the situation was complicated further because we were dealing with two forces.</p> <p>Our first step was to review each task undertaken during the custody process to understand what demands there were, discounting unnecessary bureaucracy where we found it. We then divided the tasks into specific roles for each member of staff to undertake. This not only means that work will be shared out more evenly but it introduces a level of accountability which in turn leads to better service.</p> <p>A good example of this was incoming phone calls. A huge proportion of calls were not being answered, which not only lead to frustration for the caller but created an environment where the phone was constantly ringing as callers tried the line time and time again. By making this task the responsibility of an individual team member, we found that most calls were answered first time around and the working environment was much calmer.</p> <p>After defining the tasks and roles in the existing custody suites, we set out to achieve consistency across all the new PICs, not only in the processes, but in the layout of the buildings, the products used and paperwork completed. The concept was simple: if you are an arresting officer, solicitor or interpreter dealing with a detainee, you should receive the same service and go through the same process regardless of the location.</p> <p>In its simplest form this means being confident that if you need a certain document, it will be in the same drawer, in the same room at each PIC. Just like knowing where the sugar is in your local coffee shop.</p> <p>Once you have consistency, familiarity will follow, and not just for those visiting the PICs but for the staff who work there. Due to our standard working practices we are able to move staff between sites easily and efficiently. Even the detainees become accustomed to the standards we expect from them, allowing us to keep the PICs clean and operating smoothly and safely.</p> <p><em>Chief inspector Roger Wiltshire is the head of custody services for Norfolk and Suffolk police authorities</em></p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Bashful and skittish, the Kaiser's spotted newt is intriguing and beautiful. With only around 1,000 adults left in the wild in just four mountain streams in Iran, it is also critically endangered.</p> <p>But the black, white and orange salamanders are openly on sale for as little as \u00a365 on numerous websites. While these may have been bred in captivity, they are descended from rare individuals taken from the wild, and investigators have identified dealers who say their stocks come from Iran.</p> <p>Two years ago the Kaiser's spotted newt was listed as one of the first species to be put at risk of extinction by online dealers. Now conservationists are warning that the internet is fueling unprecedented levels of illegal wildlife trade and that for many species this is now the principal threat to their survival.</p> <p>A report due to be published later this year concludes that a growing proportion of wildlife crime is using \"deep web\" tools more commonly associated with serious financial criminals, drug traffickers and child pornographers.</p> <p>\"The internet has without a doubt facilitated the huge expansion of illegal international wildlife trading over the last decade,\" said Crawford Allan, of the wildlife trade monitoring network <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org/\" title=\"\">Traffic</a>. \"Rare jewels of the forest can now be caught, boxed and shipped almost overnight just like any other express commodity.\"</p> <p>It is a wide-ranging business. Elephant ivory is used for ornaments, and parts of tigers and rhinos are used in traditional medicine or ground down and added to wine. Pelts from leopards and polar bears fetch high sums, while rare reptiles, birds and fish are bought as pets.</p> <p>There are no precise figures on the scale of the problem. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington-based lobby group, <a href=\"http://www.gfintegrity.org/storage/gfip/documents/reports/transcrime/gfi_transnational_crime_web.pdf\" title=\"\">last year estimated</a> the global illegal wildlife trade to be worth at least \u00a35bn. Various reporting systems and investigations suggest commercial exploitation of many at risk species has reached \u2013 or is close to \u2013 all-time high.</p> <p>Protected live animals and body parts are still traded in shops and markets in cities such as Bangkok and Jakarta, however much of the business is now handled online by middlemen using varying degrees of secrecy.</p> <p>Previous investigations have found a lot of trade taking place relatively openly on auction sites, via classified ads and in enthusiast chat rooms. Products from rhino, tigers and elephants are often advertised as historical artefacts without documentary proof. Animals caught in the wild are described as captive bred. Acronyms, mis-spellings and code words are used to evade detection.</p> <p>\"Once you know the terminology and you know how to search, then a lot of it is pretty open,\" said <a href=\"http://www.vincentnijman.org/\" title=\"\">Vincent Nijman</a>, a researcher at Oxford Brookes University who has studied the trade.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/Report%202007%20Bidding%20for%20Extinction.pdf\" title=\"\">investigation by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW)</a> highlighted the sale of 2,275 elephant ivory items on eight different eBay websites in a single week in 2007. The site subsequently banned such sales, but conservationists say sellers simply avoid using the word \"ivory\" in item descriptions.</p> <p>In August, for example, a search on eBay's UK site for \"ox bone\" \u2013 widely used as a euphemism for elephant ivory \u2013 yielded more than 5,000 results. An eBay spokesman told the Guardian: \"eBay works closely with conservation groups such as the IFAW and goes beyond legal requirements to restrict the sale of ivory products on the marketplaces site. The eBay trust and safety team proactively enforces eBay's policy on ivory products and works quickly to take action to remove listings of items of concern.\"</p> <p>In 2008 <a href=\"http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/FINAL%20Killing%20with%20Keystrokes%202.0%20report%202011.pdf\" title=\"\">IFAW identified</a> more than 7,000 wildlife products from threatened species being offered for sale in dozens of online auctions, forums and classified ads. Last year it found ivory worth \u00a3500,000 for sale on 43 sites based in the UK, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>International trade in wildlife is regulated by the <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/\" title=\"\">Cites convention</a>. Exploitation of around 800 threatened species is largely banned, while both exporting and importing many others requires permits.</p> <p>A forthcoming report from Traffic, the wildlife trade monitoring network, will reveal how researchers in Canada received emails from dealers offering to export coral without required permits by pretending the specimens were glass.</p> <p>IFAW, which has been working with Interpol, says organised wildlife criminals are becoming increasingly secretive online. The \"deep web\" has long been used by criminals in other spheres to evade law enforcement. Sites that are not accessible via search engines and which require software to access are used. Communications are bounced through large numbers of computers to maintain anonymity.</p> <p>\"Online wildlife trade is seen as a high-profit, low-risk activity by some criminals,\" said Kelvin Alfie of IFAW. \"A lot is shifting from publicly accessible sites to dark corners of the web.\"</p> <p>A report on the ivory trade in the EU to be published later this year by IFAW will highlight the use of tools such as mailing list servers, password-protected sites and encryption.</p> <p>National and international laws to control the trade often pre-date the online trade, and the internet has made the jobs of those trying to enforce the law and protect wildlife even harder.</p> <p>However some say the net can also be used against wildlife criminals. While it helped Kaiser spotted newt dealers to find buyers, the online traces they left alerted investigators to the existence of the trade.</p> <p>\"It works both ways,\" said Ernie Cooper, also of Traffic. \"The internet has made it easier for traders, but it has also helped us research and monitor their activities.\"</p>",
  "<p>The elections taking place across Africa this year present an opportunity for a rising tide of women to take political office. An enouraging precedent was set a few weeks ago, when the proportion of women in Senegal's parliament swelled from 22% to 43%. But without action to tackle the barriers that keep women out of power, the great wave of equality may amount to no more than a trickle.</p> <p>Those barriers are many and varied: economic dependency; limited access to education and information; discriminatory cultural and social attitudes, and negative stereotypes; the burden of domestic responsibility; and intimidation, harassment and violence.</p> <p>Any step change in women's political representation in the past decade has usually been down to the use of candidate quotas. This made the difference in Senegal, and it has made a difference elsewhere. In 1995, just seven parliaments had reached the \"critical mass\" of 30% female representation, but in 2010 that figure stood at 44. Tellingly, 20 of the 26 most equal parliaments used electoral quotas or reserved seats. In 2009, almost 50 countries held elections; in those that implemented quotas, women took 27% of the seats on average, compared to <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/bookshop/ids-bulletin/ids-bulletin-41-2010\" title=\"\">14% in countries that didn't</a>.</p> <p>Quotas are an effective way of levelling the playing field. Compensatory rather than discriminatory, they help women overcome structural inequality. It's also about reaching a tipping point where women's voices are loud enough to influence decisions and set the agenda, something virtually impossible for a token woman in a male-dominated political system.</p> <p>\"Little drops of water make an ocean,\" says Hannah Koroma, national co-ordinator of Woman Against Violence and Exploitation in Society (Waves) in Sierra Leone. Koroma emphasises the practical benefits of critical mass: \"Women have been terrified by senior male authorities in some constituencies in past elections, and in the end those women have had to step down for fear of their lives. This new system, if actualised, will ensure women's security and safety to exercise their franchise.\"</p> <p>Waves and other women's organisations across Sierra Leone are campaigning to get the government to approve a law that would reserve 30% of seats for women candidates. They feel this is the only way to address the fact that only 13.2% of the seats in the national parliament are held by women. But as Koroma explains, there's a risk that the gender equality bill won't be passed in time for November's elections. In addition, the National Election Commission of Sierra Leone has <a href=\"http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200520807.shtml\" title=\"\">proposed raising candidate fees</a> from 250,000 leones (approximately \u00a336) in 2007 to 25m leones (about \u00a33,687). The Human Rights Commission has condemned the move, as widespread poverty means many men and women will be excluded from office if these changes go ahead. But women will be hit hardest, since they are less likely to have access to financial resources.</p> <p>Lowering nomination fees can have an enormous impact on female representation at local and national level. Thanks to advocacy by, among others, <a href=\"http://www.womankind.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Womankind Worldwide</a>'s partner, <a href=\"http://www.wildaf.org/\" title=\"\">Women in Law and Development in Africa (Wildaf)</a>, Ghana's five main political parties have this year reduced nomination fees for women by 50%; the number of women standing in political party elections and primaries has already increased.</p> <p>Female parliamentarians add vital perspectives to the democratic process, and can stimulate a step change for the advancement of women's rights, bringing attention to issues affecting women in their constituencies and proving that women are more than qualified to act as decisionmakers.</p> <p>In some west African cultures and traditions, women have exercised power and even become chiefs. But often their influence has been symbolic and restricted to the upholding of tradition. Traditional female leaders have often not had the same access to education as their male counterparts, making the transition to formal politics more difficult.</p> <p>And female chiefs are by no means widely accepted. In 2009, <a href=\"http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=1&amp;num=13951&amp;printer=1\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Torto stood in a chieftancy election</a> in the Kono district of Sierra Leone. The intimidation and harassment she received from the powerful all-male \"poro\" society in her village eventually meant she had to be flown to safety in a UN helicopter, which was pelted with stones.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/16/senegal-headway-gender-equality\" title=\"\">backlash against female MPs in Senegal shows</a>, it's not plain sailing once women have reached parliament. Women in public positions are frequently sidelined and undermined by their own parties and colleagues, subject to misogynist attacks in the press, verbal harassment, and even physical violence.</p> <p>It's not enough to push a wave of women into politics, they must be supported by cultural change, and women's organisations are using innovative approaches to make this happen. As an example, Wildaf in Ghana has found that educating the whole community about representation and accountability has improved openness to what female candidates have to say.</p> <p>Quotas are just the start. As Koroma says: \"A journey begins with a footstep \u2013 give women in Sierra Leone a chance to start this journey.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pity the gardeners of Sheffield if they wanted to take their household waste to one of the city's five recycling centres last weekend. Workers there spent Saturday and Sunday, 1 and 2 September, manning picket lines - a fresh round of stoppages in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-18644619\">long-running dispute </a>over pay and conditions.</p> <p>All the usual elements of an industrial dispute are in place: a grievance about low pay, poor working conditions and allegations of unresponsive management. But this is a very modern strike too.<br> It also involves a local authority struggling to make the scale of cuts required by the government's massive public spending reductions while being hemmed-in by a long-term private waste contract that it didn't negotiate, can't change and has another 25 years left to run.</p> <p>The recycling centre workers are among <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/environment/waste.html\">Sheffield City Council</a>'s lowest paid, with most operatives scraping the minimum wage. They complain they are the poor relation of the council's binmen who earn around \u00a39.40 an hour. </p> <p>If their site achieved a 65 per cent recycling rate they receive a bonus payments to top-up their wages. These payments are worth several hundred pounds a month to each worker. But their recycling targets have now been raised to 90 per cent, making it nearly impossible for them to achieve, they claim.&#xa0;</p> <p>Management of the council's waste service is contracted out to the large waste company<a href=\"http://www.veoliaenvironmentalservices.co.uk/Sheffield/\"> Veolia</a> which in turn sub-contracts the management of the recycling sites to <a href=\"http://sovarecycling.org.uk/\">Sova Recycling Ltd</a>. This took over the management of the five sites last December and has spent the year dealing with a series of stoppages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395615492\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/4/11/1302547663797/Nick-Clegg-in-his-Sheffie-002.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg in his Sheffield Hallam constituency\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Clegg in his Sheffield Hallam constituency. Photograph: Dan Chung for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Chung/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A previous round of industrial action saw the men win a concession to receive a time-and-a half payment for working on Bank Holidays, but they get no special allowance for routinely working weekends and say that their holiday pay is not even paid at a full-day rate.&#xa0;The dispute also centres on the threat of reduced hours, as the council scales back the opening hours of the recycling centres as part of shaving \u00a357 million from its budget this year to absorb government funding cuts. </p> <p>This, says the workers, would be the final straw, cutting their take-home pay to the point it is not worth bothering to go to work.&#xa0;Peter Davies from the <a href=\"http://www.gmb.org.uk/\">GMB union</a> which represents the men says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Low pay and reduced hours simply doesn't work. You need the hours to make up for the fact you are low paid.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Many of the men are also already reeling from an equal pay ruling that has affected councils across the country and has seen some of the men working at the sites already lose thousands of pounds a year from their pay packets. Davies says:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote> <p>What the council is not telling the public is that these cuts are on top of cuts. The guys here feel they have absolutely nothing to lose.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Labour council is frank about the Hobson's choice it has to make. <a href=\"http://www.jackscott.org.uk/\">Coun Jack Scott</a>, cabinet member responsible for waste services, says: </p> <blockquote> <p>We have made a number of improvements to the service over the last few months that we thought would help to resolve this problem. However, the basic problem is that Sheffield is facing massive government cuts. Of course, if there was an alternative to making this cut, we would take it, but the reality is that this is the consequence of the scale of the cuts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some town hall figures mutter darkly about Veolia and Sova but recognise they are powerless to do much about it. The <a href=\"http://www.sheffieldlibdems.org.uk/\">Liberal Democrats</a> who ran the city until two years ago agree, but are also calling for Scott to \"consider his position\" in light of the latest bout of strikes \u2013 which may see the recycling centres shut every weekend in September.</p> <p>He in turn accuses them of \"scoring political points\" saying the reason the council has to make tough decisions is because \"Nick Clegg sold Sheffield out to go into government with the Tories\".</p> <p>The men on the picket line aren't bothered where the buck stops.

  "<p>It is the new delicacy of choice among Vietnam's high-rollers. When the young, fashionable and rich gather to party, they increasingly spice up their drink with a special ingredient: rhino horn powder.</p> <p>These status-conscious hedonists include men who believe that rhino horn can enhance their sexual performance. They apparently know or care little that, thousands of miles away, their obsession could one day drive a glorious animal to extinction.</p> <p>Between 1990 and 2005, poachers in South Africa killed an average of 14 rhinos a year. Since then the number has soared. In 2010, 333 rhinos were poached. In 2011, it was 448. So far this year, <a href=\"http://www.sanparks.org/about/news/default.php?id=55267\" title=\"\">339 rhinos have been killed</a> for their horn, putting 2012 on course to be the deadliest since records began.</p> <p>\"Losing 500 a year, when it used to be 12 or 14 a year, is a crisis,\" said Tom Milliken, east and southern Africa director of the wildlife trade monitoring network <a href=\"http://www.traffic.org/east-and-southern-africa\" title=\"\">Traffic</a>. \"Rhino horn is fetching the highest prices I've ever seen in my career.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://awsassets.panda.org/downloads/trafficrhinoreportsummary.pdf\" title=\"\">Traffic report</a>, co-authored by Milliken and published last month, blames \"a deadly combination of institutional lapses, corrupt wildlife industry professionals and Asian crime syndicates\". It identifies four main consumer groups fuelling the demand.</p> <p>\"Belief in rhino horn's detoxification properties, especially following excessive intake of alcohol, rich food and 'the good life', has given rise to an affluent group of habitual users, who routinely mix rhino horn powder with water or alcohol as a general health and hangover-curing tonic,\" the report said. \"There is a strong, socially bonding element to such consumption which typically unfolds at group functions, including so-called 'rhino wine associations' in which other Asian expatriate business elites participate.\"</p> <p>The notion that Asian traditional medicine used rhino horn as an aphrodisiac was a myth of the western media, Milliken said, but now, \"rather incredibly\", he said, it had been embraced by Vietnamese men. \"The myth has come full circle: it has taken on a life of its own.\"</p> <p>A second group of consumers are people who believe another myth: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/20/rhinos-threatened-extinction-cancer-cure\" title=\"\">that rhino horn is a miracle cure for cancer</a>. It is promoted as such by unscrupulous dealers to desperate, often dying people. Milliken said: \"We've had stories of rhino horn touts who go into cancer wards in hospitals with the hard sell.\"</p> <p>By monitoring online chatrooms, Milliken and his team were able to identify a third group: middle-class and wealthy young mothers who keep rhino horn as a home preparation to treat high fever. \"If their child falls ill and other medicines fail, they have it on hand in case of emergency.\"</p> <p>Finally, there are those using it for expensive gifts to curry favour with elites \u2013 rhino horn can be seen as \"the gift of life\". It is sometimes used as an informal currency for luxury products, such as partial payment for a new car.</p> <p>There is little awareness of where the horns come from and by what brutal means. In South Africa, rhinos are usually shot dead by AK-47 assault rifles, the report found, although lately a growing number have died from a single shot from a high-calibre rifle normally associated with wildlife industry professionals. This, along with evidence of helicopters in some incidents, suggests the emergence of \"corrupt game industry insiders\".</p> <p>From the poacher there follows a series of middlemen buyers, exporters and couriers. A courier can travel from Vietnam to South Africa, pack rhino horns into his rucksack and return within 24 hours.</p> <p>South Africa has stepped up anti-poaching measures in Kruger national park and other game reserves, making 192 arrests this year. The Vietnamese government, however, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/vietnam-rhino-horn-poaching-south-africa\" title=\"\">is accused of not taking the crisis seriously,</a> despite pressure from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites).</p> <p>But Do Quang Tung, deputy director of Cites management authority in Vietnam, said Vietnam could not be the main market for South African rhino horn \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.vietnamplus.vn/Home/Rhino-horn-claim-unfounded/20128/28188.vnplus\" title=\"\">\"not even close\"</a>. Vietnamese authorities and conservationists have denied the allegations in the study, saying it is not objective or based on evidence.</p> <p>Milliken said: \"As far as we can tell, there has not been a single seizure since 2008. Vietnam is the only country in the world where rhino horn grinding bowls are mass produced; I went to a factory that's making 30,000 of them.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If they publicly signalled that the trade is unacceptable and gives Vietnam a bad image, that would set a whole direction of the country and lead to better law enforcement. So far we're not seeing that. Everyone at the highest level is ducking and diving.\"</p> <p>South Africa has an estimated 18,000 white rhinos and 1,195 black rhinos. The number of births still exceeds the number of deaths. But Milliken warns that if the country loses more than 500 a year, the population will start shrinking by about 2018.</p> <p>While the country's <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/south-african-province-plans-birth-control-campaign-to-curb-elephant-population/article4482017/\" title=\"\">elephant population has been on an upward curve</a>, a sharp increase in the legal export of lion bones \u2013 again for traditional medicine in the far east \u2013 has raised fears of illegal poaching of lions. A recent <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-07-12-officials-turn-a-blind-eye-to-the-smuggling-of-wild-lions\" title=\"\">report in South Africa's Mail &amp; Guardian newspaper</a> detailed smuggling routes used by criminal cartels and said a complete lion skeleton can sell for up to 80,000 rand (\u00a36,000). It quoted conservationists as saying big cats could be extinct in the wild within 10-12 years.</p> <p>Joseph Okori, African rhino manager at the WWF, said: \"Wildlife crime in Africa is on the increase. Asia's economies have been growing and people who would not be able to afford these products in the past can afford them now. The only way they obtain them is through illegal means. This has created a global market that is self-perpetuating.</p> <p>\"It's a complicated situation and it will not be solved overnight. It needs international co-operation at the highest level, not just at the African Union but at the UN.\"</p>",
  "<p>Women who become pregnant with previously frozen IVF embryos tend to have healthier babies and fewer complications than those who have fresh embryos implanted, research suggests.</p> <p>Fertility doctors found that mothers had a lower risk of bleeding in pregnancies with embryos that had been frozen and thawed, and went on to have fewer pre-term and low birthweight babies.</p> <p>Fertility clinics in Britain usually transfer fresh embryos into women several days after they have been given hormone injections that stimulate their ovaries to release eggs. These are extracted and fertilised before being implanted. Any embryos that are not used straight away can be frozen for use months or years later.</p> <p>The new results raise questions about the way fertility treatment is offered in the UK. If mothers and babies fare better with previously frozen IVF embryos, it may make sense to freeze more or most embryos for transfer into women later on.</p> <p>The findings appear in a review of 11 published studies that covered more than 37,000 pregnancies in women who had either fresh or previously frozen IVF embryos implanted in their wombs.</p> <p>The doctors who led the work suspect that IVF embryos that were frozen make for healthier babies because they are implanted long after the woman's ovaries were stimulated with drugs, so hormone levels in the womb have had time to return to normal. This means the embryos implant in a more natural environment.</p> <p>Another theory is that only high-quality embryos survive the freeze and thaw process, though survival rates for frozen embryos are now more than 90% in some clinics.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.abdn.ac.uk/obsgynae/staff/details/abha.maheshwari\" title=\"Abha Maheshwari\">Abha Maheshwari</a>, a senior lecturer at Aberdeen University and consultant in reproductive medicine with NHS Grampian, described the results at the British Science Festival in Aberdeen. The report appears in the journal<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.05.019\" title=\"Obstetric and perinatal outcomes  in singleton pregnancies resulting  from the transfer of frozen thawed  versus fresh embryos generated  through in vitro fertilization treatment:  a systematic review and meta-analysis\"> Fertility and Sterility</a>.</p> <p>\"If pregnancy rates are equal and outcomes in pregnancies are better, our results question whether one should consider freezing all embryos and transfer them at a later date, rather than transferring fresh embryos,\" Maheshwari said. The practice has already been adopted by some clinics in Japan.</p> <p>Maheshwari said the case to switch to frozen-only embryos was not yet strong enough, because the full consequences are unclear. Her study did not look at pregnancy rates, for example.</p> <p>According to Alison Murdoch, head of Newcastle University's fertility centre, a shift from fresh to frozen embryos would see birth rates from IVF fall because the latter still result in fewer pregnancies overall, despite improvements in freezing and thawing techniques in recent years.</p> <p>\"We have to explore further what is the cause of frozen embryos giving us better pregnancies or lesser complications in the pregnancy,\" Maheshwari added.</p> <p>According to the review, babies born from previously frozen IVF embryos had 16% less risk of being preterm, and half the chance of being small for their gestational age, compared with babies born from fresh embryos. The babies also had a lower risk of dying soon after birth and having a low birthweight.</p> <p>The use of frozen embryos seemed to benefit mothers too. Their risk of bleeding while pregnant was a third lower with frozen IVF embryos compared with fresh embryos.</p> <p>Suzanne Cawood, deputy head of embryology at the <a href=\"http://www.crgh.co.uk/\" title=\"Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health \">Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health in London</a>, said many theories had been proposed to explain why frozen embryos fare better, but the most plausible was the delay after hormone injections.</p> <p>\"My personal belief is that when you create fresh embryos you have to undergo a lot of stimulation, so it's quite an abnormal uterine environment you are putting the embryos back into. Certainly with the frozen ones it's a more natural environment,\" she said.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.londonfertilitysurgery.co.uk/about-london-fertility-surgery/stuart-lavery/\" title=\"Stuart Lavery\">Stuart Lavery</a>, director of IVF at Hammersmith Hospital, said the findings should reassure women about the safety of frozen embryos, but did not warrant a radical overhaul of how IVF was offered.</p>"
