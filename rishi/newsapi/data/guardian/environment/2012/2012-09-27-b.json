  "<p>Touring his legendary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/15/van-morrison-astral-weeks-live\" title=\"\">Astral Weeks</a> album appears to have rejuvenated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/van-morrison?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Van Morrison</a>. His 35th solo studio album is his jazziest: the warm brass and catchy, sweet melodies recall 1970's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lFxGBB4UGU\" title=\"\">Moondance</a>. But the music's velvet glove delivers some of his hardest-hitting lyrics. With the global economic meltdown providing inspiration, End of the Rainbow finds him rueing capitalism, materialism and social climbing. Educating Archie lines up targets like ducks: \"global elites\", \"slavery to capitalism\", control by media and \u2013 most wonderfully \u2013 \"entertainment on TV and all kinds o' shite!\" Morrison is famously curmudgeonly, and there's more black humour in the sublime <a href=\"http://www.jazzfm.com/2012/09/world-exclusive-van-morrison/\" title=\"\">Goin' Down to Monte Carlo</a>. Like a Belfast Mark E Smith, he flees Sartre's \"hell\" of other people only to find himself bombarded by \"some kind of phoney pseudo-jazz!\" Elsewhere, his moods swing like the rhythm section. Open the Door is warm and friendly, Pagan Heart a Doorsy blues. Of all the songs here, If in Money We Trust \u2013 a mantra-like rumination on the love of Mammon over God \u2013 most deserves to join his pantheon of classics.</p>",
  "<p>Quick: name the most memorable moment from the three presidential debates between Barack Obama and John McCain?</p> <p>Nothing coming to mind? (And no, Sarah Palin saying \"you betcha\" in the vice-presidential debate doesn't count.)</p> <p>How about the 2004 debates between John Kerry and George W Bush? Well, there was that line about a \"global test\" and then that great internet rumor that Bush had <a href=\"http://www.visualfuturist.com/bushiswired/\">a radio receiver on his back</a>. But anything else ring a bell?</p> <p>This isn't just a memory test for Guardian readers \u2013 it's a perhaps less-than-subtle reminder that even though presidential debates are often viewed as the most important part of a campaign (aside from the national conventions), they actually affect the final election results a lot less than you might think. If Mitt Romney is hoping that the debates turn the tide in what is an ever-widening polling gap between him and Barack Obama, he might want to think again.</p> <p>The idea of debates being a less consequential campaign event will likely seem counter-intuitive to many. For weeks, these TV setpieces have been hyped as the signal events of the fall campaign. And doesn't history provide many lessons of game-changing debate moments?</p> <p>Was it not Richard Nixon's five o'clock shadow that doomed him against the much smoother John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QazmVHAO0os&amp;feature=player_embedded\">in 1960</a>? Or what about Ronald Reagan's famous quip in 1984, when asked if he was too old to be president:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's (Walter Mondale) youth and inexperience.\"</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJhCjMfRndk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJhCjMfRndk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Or what about Michael Dukakis's robotic response to a query about whether he would still oppose the death penalty for a rapist-killer if his wife, Kitty, had been the victim?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aUXz4wFDAo0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aUXz4wFDAo0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>These are just the sort of game-changing moments that allow the Romney campaign a flicker of hope.</p> <p>But not so fast. While political pundits love to impart great meaning and importance to these events, political scientists aren't so convinced. As John Sides, a political scientist at George Washington University, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2012/ten_miles_square/do_presidential_debates_really039413.php?page=1\">wrote recently</a> in Washington Monthly:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Scholars who have looked most carefully at the data have found that, when it comes to shifting enough votes to decide the outcome of the election, presidential debates have rarely, if ever, mattered \u2026 in the average election year, you can accurately predict where the race will stand after the debates by knowing the state of the race before the debates.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Debate gaffes, like your garden-variety campaign gaffes, rarely, if ever, move public opinion polls or affect the final outcome of elections. Even if Dukakis had given a more emotional response to the death penalty question, or if George Bush hadn't been caught <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/01/17/a-damaging-impatience\">checking his watch</a> during the 1992 debate, both candidates were still likely to lose.</p> <p>Reagan's zinger against Mondale was highly effective, but incumbents who win 49 states don't need a great debate line to ride to victory.</p> <p>The first of two possible exceptions to the general rule of debate irrelevance is the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/debates/history/1980/index.shtml\">1980 debate between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter</a>, which came only days before the election. While Reagan held a small lead going into the debate, by the weekend before election day, polls showed him approaching a landslide-like advantage. The debate, rather than \"changing the game\", simply confirmed the direction the polls were already headed \u2013 albeit in a decisive manner.</p> <p>Reagan, who was regularly portrayed by Carter in the most negative terms imaginable and, in particular, as a war-monger, came across as cool, calm and collected \u2013 anything but a loose cannon. If Americans needed reassurance that they could trust Reagan in the White House, the debate clinched it.</p> <p>In 2000, Al Gore's <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-october-4-2000/indecision-2000---sigh-language\">constant sighing</a> during his first presidential debate with George W Bush turned him into an object of ridicule (even Saturday Night Live poked fun at Gore's tic). According to Sides, Gore's unfortunate show of contemptuous impatience may have shifted the polls by two to three points in sympathy with his opponent, Bush. Considering the narrowness of Gore's eventual \"defeat\", the debate could be considered one of several decisive factors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.nbc.com/assets/video/widget/widget.html?vid=1356981\"> <iframe id=\"nbc-video-widget\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.nbc.com/assets/video/widget/widget.html?vid=1356981\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But for those two examples, there is always the experience of John Kerry, who, in 2004, won not one, not two, but all three presidential debates against George W Bush, according to post debate polling \u2013 and still lost the election. Quite simply, Kerry's strong performance couldn't cancel out the advantages of his opponent. Or, still more importantly, while the debates gave him a boost in the polls, they didn't have the effect of fundamentally reversing the trajectory of the race. This is perhaps the most important factor: debates might affect the polls around the margins, but they have never had a seismic impact on a presidential campaign.</p> <p>And this brings us back to Mitt Romney. If the latest public opinion polls are to be believed, the Romney campaign is in serious and deepening trouble. Not only is he <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/27/politics/campaign-wrap/index.html\">trailing in the national polls</a>, but he is also losing badly in <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/20/1134217/-New-Swing-State-Polls-Show-Romney-Falling-With-More-Trouble-Possibly-Looming\">swing state polls</a> from Ohio, Virginia and Florida, each of which suggests that Obama is opening up sizable, even insurmountable, leads.</p> <p>No matter how well Romney does in his debates with Obama, what reason is there to believe that he can do well enough to reverse this increasingly dire trend? Have any actions to date by the gaffe-tastic Romney given credence to the notion that he has the political chops to change the direction of the race in these debates? If anything, because of his now almost daily faux pas, even the smallest slip-up has the potential to dominate post debate coverage. The guy is practically going to have to bat 1,000, just to eke out a win.</p> <p>Moreover, it's not all about Romney. There is even less reason to believe that Barack Obama will make a mistake so grievous and costly that he will open the door to a Romney comeback. There's a reason, after all, people call him \"no-drama Obama\".</p> <p>Unless the president uses the debate to unleash a profanity-laced diatribe against the people of Ohio and Florida, it's very hard to imagine anything he could do or say that would badly hurt him. To be honest, even if he were, inexplicably, to do such a thing, I'm not convinced it would cost him the election. Considering the current polarization of the electorate and the dearth of undecided voters \u2013 short of Obama's breaking out the legendary \"whitey\" tape, or admitting that, yes, he was born in Kenya \u2013 he's likely safe.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest that voters shouldn't tune in to the debates. They are an excellent opportunity to more fully appreciate the positions of the two candidates and understand the rather profound differences between the two parties. Just don't expect it to make much of a difference in a race where the outlines of the final results are becoming increasingly clear.</p>",
  "<p>Zoe Williams (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/26/targeting-families-nothing-to-do-with-fairness\" title=\"\">Targeting families has got nothing to do with fairness</a>, 27 September) rightly condemns the way in which politicians of all parties deploy family support provision as a political football. She is kind to overlook the potentially collusive role played, if unintentionally, by social researchers. As researchers, we believe we have a responsibility to avoid increasing the risk of stigma for families, or apportioning blame to practitioners, through a mindless adherence to \"outcome theology\". There is debate among researchers as to the extent that \"outcomes\" (in the complex context of where people live such as in poverty/deprivation/bad or no housing etc) can be straightforwardly captured in a limited time frame. For example, the payment by results pilots in children's centres have a series of measurement points at 12 weeks.</p> <p>Considerable risks derive from an unquestioning \"faith in the outcome mantra\". First, those families who can't be seen to hit the outcome in the relevant period, risk being further stigmatised or labelled; second, practitioners, who if they can't be seen to have waved a magic wand in the requisite timescale, risk being viewed as incompetent. Some researchers will be more sceptical about outcome theology than others, but hopefully all of us will want to try and avoid the temptation to gloss over uncomfortable political debates about poverty and inequality.<br><strong>Professor Jane Tunstill</strong><br><strong>James Blewett</strong><br><em>Kings College, London University </em></p> <p>\u2022 Energy secretary Ed Davey's decision to change the criteria for measuring fuel poverty, so as to reduce the soaring numbers, is not just an attempt to reduce the grants paid out, but is an acknowledgement that energy policies being pursued and being proposed will do nothing to reduce short- to medium-term energy costs for consumers and industry (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/sep/19/low-users-pay-more-energy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Low users paying more for energy</a>, 19 September).</p> <p>A plethora of green taxes to raise money to help subsidise renewable energy has caused electricity bills to rise in recent years, but the worst is yet to come. Next April, the government will introduce a carbon-price floor which will increase by 178%, on present figures, the price paid by electricity generators for the carbon dioxide they emit.</p> <p>Given the UK relies on carbon-emitting fossil fuelled plants to generate more than 75% of its electricity, this new carbon tax will cause electricity prices to spike and then continue to rise in line with the carbon-price floor's steep trajectory. British and European carbon prices are presently the same, at around \u20ac7.5 (\u00a36) a tonne emitted, but Britain will introduce its own rising carbon-price floor next year, starting at \u20ac20 a tonne. This will create a large disparity with EU carbon prices.</p> <p>Rather than changing the criteria to massage fuel poverty figures downwards, the coalition should abandon plans to impose a unilateral new rising carbon tax and instead guarantee that Britain's carbon prices will remain the same as our EU competitors, while examining viable ways to strengthen EU-wide carbon prices.<br><strong>Tony Lodge</strong><br><em>Research fellow, </em><a href=\"http://www.cps.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Policy Studies</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Nick Clegg says \"no attack on welfare without new taxes on rich\" (Report, 23 September). That means that as long as the most able are asked to pay more in taxes, he will support savage cuts in welfare. Clegg and his kind are oblivious to the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable, the logic of cuts in welfare and other essential spending have become accepted as a new neocon orthodoxy. Sadly, the Labour party is unlikely to pose any real opposition, and we will have to rely on the trade unions to carry the fight on behalf of the majority of the people who aren't rich or privileged.<br><strong>Des Charles</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p>",
  "<p>In simultaneously seeking to assert a classically Liberal identity for his party while pledging his continued allegiance to the coalition project, Nick Clegg unwittingly exposes the fundamental delusion that underpins Liberal Democrat thinking: the fantasy that a compassionate and enabling social order can be built on the foundations of long-discredited rightwing economics.</p> <p>The Liberal ideal of freedom is a fine thing for those who have it. For the rest of us to come within shouting distance of such freedom \u2013 to move beyond Clegg's limp \"freedom to be who you are\" to the opportunity to become who we might be \u2013 requires not more Orange Book laissez-faire and privatisation, but a government prepared to wrest back control from the markets and the rent-seekers, to assert and convince the electorate of government's legitimate rights and obligations in such areas as education, healthcare, welfare and investment in and oversight of what used to be called the commanding heights of the economy.</p> <p>Given the overwhelming evidence of the failure of the market project of the last 30 years, it shouldn't be that hard, but clearly someone like Clegg, who cannot make the most basic connection between an abstract concept of freedom and the policies needed actually to achieve it on behalf of the majority, can never be part of the programme.</p> <p>In 1821 Liberal basically meant not Tory; if it means anything at all today, it means more or less Tory.<br><strong>Root Cartwright</strong><br><em>Radlett, Hertfordshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 Nick Clegg's was almost the worst leader's speech I have heard in nearly 50 years of listening to Liberal and Liberal Democrat leaders. He has signed his own political death warrant. It may take some time before he has to go, but what is now frightening is his apparent determination to take the rest of us down with him. To call Jo Grimond in evidence was a disgrace.

I wrote a pamphlet called What's the Beef?, showing that there was, then, a high degree of overlap between the two parties' policies.</p> <p>But I have to say that today, all the Lib Dem MPs, including those who appeared on Linc platforms, having trooped loyally through the lobbies since May 2010 to support Michael Gove's dismantling the principle of local democratic responsibility for education which dates back to 1870, Andrew Lansley's determination to hand the NHS over to the private sector, and Iain Duncan-Smith's plans that will make tens of thousands of families homeless and destroy the quality of life of hundreds of thousands of disabled people, I have to question whether any of those MPs are properly described as part of a \"progressive majority\" (Martin Kettle, Guardian, 27 September).</p> <p>The challenge after the 2015 general election will be, rather like that after 1945, to build, on the wreckage the Tories have left and, in a period of austerity, a new welfare state fit for our times.&#xa0;That's a task for real progressives, not people emerging from five years self-imposed exile on Planet Osborne and pleading for a second chance.<br><strong>Pete Ruhemann</strong><br><em>Reading</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee's mocking comment (27 September) that Clegg reprised his \"scare-mongering Greek comparisons\" speech at conference, seems to have backfired on her quite spectacularly.

Or does Ms Toynbee still believe such a financial meltdown couldn't have happened here,&#xa0; especially if the sainted Ed Balls were chancellor?

  "<p>If you believe everything you read (elsewhere, that is), you'd think modern pop is simply a cot blanket intended to pacify the masses. Fortunately, there are still true believers in music's potential for enlightenment. One such acolyte is Eddington Howard of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/07/new-band-oddience\" title=\"\">Oddience</a>, an LA-based, acid-laced outfit currently gathering giddy plaudits with their floaty, sunshine-powered, semi-improvised take on hip-hop.</p> <p>\"Music taught me to be a free-thinker,\" says Howard. \"It's taught me how to groove, to go with the flow. Overall, music has taught me to <em>be</em>.\"</p> <p>Oddience are part of a group of musicians who are deploying psychedelic philosophies in new territories. Sonically, these artists have little in common \u2013 after all, unlike, say, dubstep's infrasonic bass, psychedelia doesn't have a signature sound that can be easily appropriated with a Logic preset. What they share is a desire to expand their consciousnesses. This usually means gleefully dumping the conventions of their nominal host genre. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/electricyouthmusic\" title=\"\">Electric Youth</a>, for example, had a narrow escape from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/feb/25/chill-wave-twee-pop-genres\" title=\"\">chillwave</a>, but their recent track <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRZNyCwaPoY\" title=\"\">The Best Thing</a> sounds like a lost pop anthem. <a href=\"http://kilokish.com/\" title=\"\">Kilo Kish</a>, meanwhile, mix psychedelic singer-songwriter stylings with hip-hop urgency and, as on new single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" huk4riipow8&amp;feature=\"player_embedded&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">Navy</a>, kitchen-sink observations about the celestial nature of humanity.</p> <p>At its best, this correspondence school of music weaves the boundaries of house, hip-hop, R&amp;B and miscellaneous electronica into a Venn diagram of genres resembling a Technicolor Spirograph spiderweb. It's at the heart of the avant-garde soul of Shabazz Palaces collaborators <a href=\"http://www.theesatisfaction.com/\" title=\"\">TheeSatisfaction</a>, whose deceptively catchy <a href=\"http://www.subpop.com/releases/theesatisfaction/full_lengths/awe_naturale\" title=\"\">awE naturalE</a> album conceals a multitude of <a href=\"http://theesatisfaction.bandcamp.com/album/theesatisfaction-loves-stevie-wonder-why-we-celebrate-colonialism\" title=\"\">shape-shifts</a>. It's the keystone of Flying Lotus's relatively restrained new album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/sep/26/flying-lotus-until-quiet-comes-stream\" title=\"\">Until the Quiet Comes</a>, notable for reining his sprawling abstract funk into tunes you can almost whistle.</p> <p>And it's central to the aesthetic of <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/sethtroxler\" title=\"\">Seth Troxler</a>, feted techno DJ, producer and linchpin of the Visionquest label collective, whose music is yet to find a sound it hasn't assimilated. Troxler's love of psychedelia is lavishly expressed on his <a href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=156\" title=\"\">Resident Advisor podcast</a>, which skipped barefoot from Pink Floyd to hyphy rappers Dem Hoodstarz, while still making perfect thematic sense (his more recent <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/r_co/seth-troxler-essential-mix-07\" title=\"\">Essential Mix for Radio 1</a>, with Jamie Jones, is also a treat). Troxler's curiosity encompasses all aspects of the psychedelic experience, with a particular focus on the power of pattern recognition on consciousness. To explore this, his productions, and DJ sets, contain specific, evolving rhythmic patterns intended to induce a trance-like experience in the listener.</p> <p>Visionquest was famously born out of a communal acid trip shared by the label's founders, and the group now plan to make manifest their vision through a series of events held in \"explorative\" environments, augmented with music to try to open the attendees' pineal eyes.</p> <p>Troxler says they hope to encourage a wave of similar \"large, spiritual events, rather than just having raves and festivals, which are kind of bullshit at the moment. People aren't pushing the boundaries. And if people don't push those boundaries, people forget that there are boundaries to be pushed. Where will that leave us in 50 or 100 years? Is it something that will be lost?\"</p>&lt;  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:leila_h:playlist:1PNWKAXArhGxkq3jg31ybn\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:leila_h:playlist:1PNWKAXArhGxkq3jg31ybn\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  p&gt;The interaction between the listener, the music and the environment is a source of inspiration for other artists, too. FlyLo heralded his album's launch with a fittingly eye-bending video for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuQGfk9Gmgo\" title=\"\">Putty Boy Strut</a> by psychedelic animator <a href=\"http://www.cyriak.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cyriak</a>, whose own work is inspired by the mathematics of nature. <p>\"The music seemed to tell its story quite clearly,\" says Cyriak. \"It's a journey from naive simplicity to complex discord and back again, with a transformation at the end. The basic sounds and repetitive nature of the main theme suggested something mechanical and yet childlike, so from there I had the subject, style and storyline I needed: a cartoon robot world whose perfect balance is upset, resulting in destruction that in turn creates something new.\"</p> <p>Similarly, LA's Oddience wowed the music nerdsphere with their recent mini-movie <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHtIifSBGEs\" title=\"\">Lit Lava Lamp</a>, which cuts their trippy, cloud-headed tracks, Homeboy Palm Tree, The Dew and Goldblum into a \"tramedy\" about four isolated individuals sharing the same moment that may or may not be the end of the world. \"Where we live is a crazy place,\" says Howard. \"You can create your own reality, because it's a paradise, so it can be whatever you want it to be. You can be this unhappy person in this beautiful, sick, shiny city, but at the same time that's an idea you've missed in your own mind.Once you really open yourself up and look around, this place is nuts \u2013 it's got perfect weather, it's got every fuckin' geographical environment, there's always something to do. I think that mix comes across in the music.\"</p> <p>Although psychedelia is more commonly associated with skinny white boys with Boris Johnson hair and a borrowed sitar, many of its greatest achievements come from the worlds of soul, funk and jazz, whether it's the endtimes social surrealism of Funkadelic's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh3bleXWaCk\" title=\"\">Maggot Brain</a>, the evolutionary introspection of Stevie Wonder's Innervisions or the embryonic-electronic generalised freakout of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alA8sjIejRk\" title=\"\">Miles Davis's On the Corner</a>. Howard refuses to self-identify as a psych artist yet he cites this seam as a key influence. \"A lot of the ideas that came out of psychedelia were about peace and love, the connection between human beings, and sharing human experience,\" he says. \"I feel like a lot of our lyrics, as well as the melodies, definitely go along with the psychedelic idea. I really believe in higher learning, speaking your mind, connecting with other people. Psychedelia will teach you a lot in terms of living.\"</p> <p>Peace, love and empathy aside, psychedelia was once viewed as a potential instrument of revolution during the civil rights era in the US: in 1971 vice-president Spiro Agnew personally intervened to block the release of Eugene McDaniels's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_Heroes_of_the_Apocalypse\" title=\"\">Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse</a>, believing it would inspire mass riots. It's not that surprising he wasn't a fan \u2013 aside from that album's incendiary lyrics, psychedelia encourages its fans to question their beliefs. Troxler enthuses that this particular element changed his life for ever.</p> <p>\"You can see the correlation between the music that people listen to and also the ideas that they represent in their everyday lives,\" he says. \"That's something that I think is profound about psychedelia. If you listen to experimental music, your perception of life is also more open. It's about finding that self within, and then when you do, you're much more able to create yourself in the outer world.'</p> <p>Quite aside from the acid and general bohemianism inherent in the scene, psychedelia encourages listeners to view existence more objectively, taking other personal perspectives into account. Troxler likens this process to hallucinogen - and ritual music-assisted initiation rites prevalent in many civilisations from the Americas and Africa, in which the passage to adulthood is marked by a great epiphany. \"With the music, or anything else, it's about giving the opportunity to realise that we are conscious beings,\" he says. \"In many ways I think that is the point of our existence.\"</p> <p>For his part, Troxler sees employing music's transformative power almost as a social responsibility, suggesting that the commercial neutering of music is mirrored by a societal drift away from mass political engagement.</p> <p>\"It's a weird situation \u2013 you want to challenge but you want to entertain. But not to challenge is a lost opportunity for influencing people. Once you go within, then you can stand up and say something. But if you don't, you live in this brainwashed lollipop world where it's easier to just be in a coma and take things as they are. People who are into more challenging psychedelic music challenge life itself, and that's where we make progress. Rather than in America, being like a sheep, where you're told, 'this is not just what it is, but also what it can be'. When you've had the psychedelic experience,\" concludes Troxler, \"the curtain in some way is dropped.\"</p> <p><em>Seth Troxler plays the <a href=\"http://www.thewarehouseproject.com/eventProfile.php?eid=2\">Warehouse Project</a>, Manchester, on Saturday 29 September.</em></p>",
  "<p>At half-time, this is a curiously flat political landscape. No one is a clear winner yet, and few can read the runes of a public opinion disaffected and deaf to political speak. Party conferences fall further down the running order of news bulletins and fewer people watch. Wise money hesitates to bet on either party quite yet.</p> <p>Labour knows very well that despite a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/21/icm-poll-data-labour-conservatives\" title=\"\">10-point lead</a>, no deal is struck with the voters. Without that crucial trust to run the economy best, a high poll dividend from an unpopular government, falling living standards and unprecedented cuts is not enough. For&#xa0;Labour to win a swath of southern, bellwether seats like Stevenage, all they&#xa0;needs is a swing of 4%-5%. But if they want to scare themselves, Peter Kellner of <a href=\"http://yougov.co.uk/\" title=\"\">YouGov</a> has charts showing no opposition ever won without at some&#xa0;point hitting a 20% lead.</p> <p>However, these are uncharted waters, Kellner says, where past maps may be no guide. As the Liberal Democrat vote implodes, the rules change: more protest votes fall to Labour, who will pluck some of their seats. But what happens in the two-thirds of Lib Dem seats where Tories are the main contenders? The big question is whether all those Labour voters who lend their tactical votes to Lib Dems can bring themselves to do it again. If not, those seats fall to Cameron.</p> <p>The seats arithmetic is imponderable, but one thing is clear: Labour needs to embrace the third party and encourage supporters to keep voting Lib Dem to keep the Tories out. If there is a hung parliament, an amicable path to Labour's own rose-garden embrace needs rolling out well in advance to stop those Lib Dem seats from turning blue.</p> <p>Paddy Ashdown, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/26/libdems-sketch-nick-clegg-paddy-ashdown\" title=\"\">taking over as election supremo</a>, needs to grasp this: it's no good being equidistant this time.&#xa0;Attacking Labour will save no seats, while turning his heavy artillery on the&#xa0;Tories makes it far more likely that those Labour voters will stay voting for Lib Dem MPs \u2013 and Lib Dem voters who have fled may return.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/pollytoynbee\" title=\"\">came away from their conference depressed by Nick Clegg's speech</a>. Its callow attack on Labour for crashing the global economy and even for failing to protect the vulnerable was coupled with&#xa0;a dismal \"There Is No Alternative\" backing for Osborne's calamitous economic policy. What a cul-de-sac he has led his party into, and how badly he has played his strong cards.</p> <p>Labour supporters, spitting expletives, vow coalition is unthinkable. But&#xa0;they need to think again. This is not just about cynical electoral self-interest. Even now, with so many voters having bolted, most in the Lib Dem rainbow party remain closer to Labour. Plenty I met in Brighton are social democrats motivated by social justice. Plenty mistrust Labour for good reasons. This pantomime horse of a party can work with Labour \u2013 if it relegates its Clegg Orange Bookers to the hind quarters and gives its progressives their head.</p> <p>Tribal Labour activists swearing vengeance must honestly ask themselves this: how much better would the last Labour era have been in coalition with the Lib Dems? No Iraq, no civil liberties abuses, less defence spending, no soaring jail numbers, stronger climate change action, and bolder Europeanism. That's the difficult paradox. The next Labour government would probably be better in harness with the Lib Dems as well. Even if Labour wins outright, Ed Miliband should not abandon a close alliance, as Tony Blair did with the arrogance of a landslide victor.</p> <p>Can Labour win? Extraordinarily, that looks not just possible but likely, helped by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/22/lib-dems-boundary-changes-revolt?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Lib Dems blocking boundary changes</a>. Remember how no one thought so back in 2010. Insiders said glumly that David Cameron had earned two or even three terms by purging nastiness and going green and compassionate. He found a magic New Tory formula while Labour, at a shocking 29%, looked done for. Ed Miliband's whisker win against his brother boded ill for party harmony. How much has changed in a remarkably short time.</p> <p>Miliband has been lucky as well as astute. No more Mr Nice, Cameron and his party have thrown away their advantage by emerging as the most rightwing government since the war. In a piece in the current issue of the IPPR journal Juncture, Professor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tim-bale\" title=\"\">Tim Bale</a>, analyst of the modern Tory party, writes that \"Cameron was and is no less a Thatcherite than the vast majority of his colleagues\". A Conservative party whose left has \"withered away \u2026 possibly fatally for the party's chances\" has vacated that winning ground. Unwisely gleeful in wielding the axe, the party wants more and faster cuts, leaving no route back to the \"nice\" zone.</p> <p>Success breeds unity. The shadow cabinet is more united than Labour has been for many a long year, and Ed Miliband has won authority over them. He has risked much and reaped rewards for attacking Murdoch and framing the debate on good and bad capitalism.</p> <p>But all attention falls on <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/annual_conference_2012\" title=\"\">the theatrics of his conference speech</a>. Does&#xa0;it matter? Only watched by political addicts, few ever remember the content. Yet by some strange osmosis, voters do absorb the character question that decides elections. Is he the right stuff, tough enough, trustworthy, competent? Change is the eternal opposition message \u2013 change from this government's failed economy and change from some of Labour's own past, too. Some call for reams of new policy, but wise oppositions are sparing. One or two concrete ideas must light up the party's direction of travel, but good policies will be stolen and others pass their sell-by date long before the election. Labour remembers how they yearned for Tory oppositions to proffer policies they could tear to pieces.</p> <p>Tearing to pieces is what Ed Miliband can expect next. Cameron has ordered the shooting season to begin, according to insiders at the FT. A week ago at Chequers, he ordered the dogs to be unleashed with \"no qualms about making ad hominem attacks\" on the Labour leader. A sign of panic at their bad polls, Labour says, without blenching. If Cameron's softened policy on regulation of the press has indeed pulled the Tory press back in line, then expect the full force of their media dominance to crash in on Miliband shortly. But by accident, Cameron may hand him the chance to prove his resilience under fire.</p>",

  "<p>It can be said without fear of contradiction that the narrative to the 39th Ryder Cup so far bears no resemblance to the 38 that have gone before. Soft golfing souls would be entitled to question what exactly is going on in this corner of Illinois. There had already been talk of marked men, bullseyes on backs, killing and beating brains in before Bubba Watson sauntered into the Ryder Cup media centre on Thursday morning and paid a glowing tribute to the United States military.</p> <p>If this was not entirely in keeping with the obscure discussion that had gone before, Watson's comments would have been met with widespread bemusement.</p> <p>The start on Friday of the actual golf, one of sport's finest spectacles, will hopefully offer both distraction and sanity. One of the most evenly matched Ryder Cups in living memory has that wonderful quality of being virtually impossible to predict. Which does not deter plenty from trying.</p> <p>Perhaps the loose language of competitors in the buildup has been entirely deliberate. Gone are the days, after all, when the Ryder Cup was a clear and obvious battle between players based in separate continents. When the Europe team landed in Chicago from Heathrow on Monday, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal had only three of his players for company; the remainder could be classed as local commuters.</p> <p>There can be no reasonable claim that Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, Graeme McDowell, Justin Rose or Luke Donald lack passion for Europe's Ryder Cup simply because they are now based on this side of the Atlantic. Poulter, in particular, relishes a meeting with the USA more than anything. Nonetheless, the epic growth of the Ryder Cup as a tournament \u2013 and commercial monster \u2013 belies the fact those featuring in it are generally close acquaintances. Neighbours, even.</p> <p>\"A lot of us are friends, so there is probably less edge. It is not like 'them and us',\" Westwood said. Similar thoughts emerged from Watson, once he moved on from his praise of the armed forces. \"We're friends with all of them,\" the Masters champion said. \"We have played golf with all of them for years. We know them all. We know their families.\"</p> <p>The Ryder Cup lacks the divisive characters of its past, which is perhaps an explanation of the strong sentiment that has been abroad in recent days. The players want to be viewed as fierce rivals and strong competitors, not blokes who wave at each other while completing their school run in Florida.</p> <p>The hosts have plenty of cause for motivation this time around. Six defeats in eight Ryder Cup matches have wounded the USA to an extent that has been perfectly plain even during practice rounds at Medinah. The galleries are visibly keyed up, a factor that will be endorsed by a spine-tingling atmosphere around the 1st tee when Europe formally open the competition first thing on Friday morning.</p> <p>It may well be folly for European hopes to rest heavily on the inexperience of their opponents. The USA have four rookies but had three at Valhalla in 2008 when Europe were defeated by five points. That said, Nick Faldo's glaring shortcomings as a captain will not be repeated by the impressive Olaz\u00e1bal.</p> <p>As ever, there is no lack of on-course subplots. Intrigue will surround how Rory McIlroy handles intense scrutiny in a team environment, whether or not Tiger Woods can finally revel in the Ryder Cup and if Davis Love III can keep his emotions suitably in check. Already, the USA captain has had to fight back tears in a mundane press conference. Love could show no such restraint over dinner earlier in the week, with Watson also reaching for his handkerchief.</p> <p>This Ryder Cup should be more notable than most for excitement. Medinah retains a brilliant closing stretch, the sort that will trigger scintillating matchplay denouements. The complete lack of anything closely resembling rough opens up birdie opportunities at every corner of the course. It also brings the recovery shot, the most exciting in the game, back into play.</p> <p>Some argue this set-up automatically favours the Americans, a notion that is particularly backed up by reality. Love has placed an emphasis on length but Medinah's relatively small greens and sloping fairways mean it would be folly to ignore the value of accuracy.</p> <p>Europe retain four of the five top-ranked players in world golf, a tribute to their respective abilities to compete in different countries and on varying types of course. McIlroy, twice, and McDowell have won major championships in the USA within the last two years.</p> <p>Olaz\u00e1bal will field eight players with overall winning Ryder Cup points records; not a single USA team member has likewise.</p> <p>As a constant backdrop, there is the lingering image of Seve Ballesteros. The first Ryder Cup since his death cannot and will not pass without regular reminders of the Spaniard's brilliance in and adoration of the event. In short, Ballesteros loved nothing more than beating the USA.</p> <p>The odds are stacked against Olaz\u00e1bal paying the ultimate tribute to Ballesteros by retaining the trophy Europe won two years ago in Wales. But the truth is he has every chance of doing precisely that. It would be no further exaggeration of language to point out, in such a scenario, golfing immortality would beckon.</p>",
  "<p>It is the testosterone-fuelled, high-octane motoring show beloved by the country. But never before has talking about fast cars proved so lucrative for Jeremy Clarkson, who has scooped a multimillion pound windfall signing a deal to present Top Gear for three more years.</p> <p>The real engine of his financial success comes not from his on-screen presenter's fee, but from the BBC buying out his 30% stake in a company set up to exploit the commercial opportunities generated by the hit BBC2 motoring show that Clarkson helped to reinvent a decade ago.</p> <p>Co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond are also committing to BBC2's most popular programme for another three years.</p> <p>But it is Clarkson who is in line to make the most money because, unlike his on-screen colleagues, he was a shareholder in a joint venture with BBC Worldwide \u2013 the corporation's commercial arm \u2013 responsible for live shows, DVDs and licensing Top Gear spin-offs around the world.</p> <p>Clarkson's financial arrangements with the BBC already meant he was easily the best-paid man working at the corporation, earning somewhere over \u00a33m last year \u2013 but apart from a six-figure presenting fee for Top Gear, most of his income came from commercial activities.</p> <p>The other likely multimillionaire is Andy Wilman, Top Gear's producer \u2013 who was at Repton school with Clarkson \u2013 and who is also credited with revitalising a show that faced the axe by the BBC, by turning it into a boys'-own racing and reviewing adventure format with global appeal.</p> <p>Clarkson and Wilman \u2013 with a 20% stake \u2013 together owned half of a company called Bedder 6, which was set up with the BBC five years ago. Originally designed to keep the pair loyal to the hugely successful programme, and reduce the amount of money paid out by the licence fee payer, Top Gear's global success meant that both men made significant sums.</p> <p>The on-screen agreement for Clarkson sees the BBC buying out Clarkson and Wilman's stakes in the lucrative Bedder 6, handing them an unspecified \u2013 but substantial \u2013 windfall. BBC Worldwide will now take full control of Bedder 6 and the profits it produces.</p> <p>Insiders indicated that the buyout involved a seven-figure sum. Clarkson took to Twitter to say that any suggestions that his share could be worth \u00a310m or more were \"seriously wrong\".</p> <p>Bedder 6 made \u00a315.2m in pre-tax profits in the year to March 2011, such is the success of the company. At that level of profit the business could be valued at between \u00a350m and \u00a3100m \u2013 but the structure of the BBC takeover is unknown. But Clarkson and Wilman resigned as directors of Bedder 6 two weeks ago. Under the new deal, May and Hammond will now get a share of Top Gear's commercial revenue, in return for promoting the show around the world. But the money will be paid to them directly by BBC Worldwide, not channelled via a separate company.</p> <p>In July it emerged that Clarkson's income from the motoring programme was boosted by \u00a3900,000 to \u00a32.7m in the year to the end of March after dividends from Bedder 6 increased from \u00a39m from \u00a36m the previous year. Added to his Bedder 6 fee of \u00a3350,000 and talent fee from the BBC, believed to be just under \u00a3500,000, this took the total Clarkson earned from Top Gear to more than \u00a33.5m.</p> <p>There has been speculation that May and Hammond \u2013 Captain Slow and The Hamster to fans of the show \u2013 were concerned at missing out on a share of the show's DVD sales and income from live shows that went into Bedder 6.</p> <p>A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: \"BBC Worldwide has agreed new commercial deals with Jeremy, James, Richard and Andy to secure Top Gear's international future for another three years.</p> <p>\"This agreement secures the commercial future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world, reinvest in Top Gear and return profits to the BBC.\"</p> <p>The popularity of Top Gear around the world means Clarkson and Wilman have been piling up cash at a time when other top BBC \"talent\" has faced pay cuts as the corporation attempts to cut costs after the licence was frozen at \u00a3145.50.</p> <p>Earlier this year the BBC revealed that the combined pay of its stars earning \u00a31m-plus annually had fallen to \u00a39.7m from \u00a314.7m the previous year.</p> <p>The BBC's millionaire pay club comprises between three and six stars, according to the corporation's annual report. The individuals are not identified, but are understood to include Graham Norton and Gary Lineker.</p> <p>Norton took a pay cut when he renegotiated his BBC deal and Lineker is expected to face pressure to take less money when his contract comes up for renewal next year. The BBC paid 16 performers more than \u00a3500,000 in the 12 months to the end of March, compared with 19 the previous year.</p> <p>Top Gear has been identified as one of BBC Worldwide's global brands \u2013 along with the likes of Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 with the potential to generate commercial revenue internationally.</p> <p>Commercial spin-offs include versions of Top Gear magazine in 31 countries, a live tour that has visited cities including Perth, Moscow and Stockholm. The original show is broadcast in about 200 territories and local versions have been made in countries including the US and South Korea.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">Economy</a></h2> <p><strong>It's the economy, stupid \u2013 or is it? You have to go back more than 70 years to find a president who retained his job when so many of his compatriots lost theirs. Economic gloom made short work of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr. But Barack Obama's record is not all bad \u2013 and that might be good enough to save him, says Larry Elliott</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama should be toast. Under his stewardship, the US economy has suffered its feeblest economic recovery since the second world war. Living standards for the average American have fallen since he arrived at the White House almost four years ago.</p> <p>Despite his rallying call to the struggling and the dispossessed in 2008, poverty is rising and the gap between rich and poor has grown. History shows that the last incumbent president to win an election with the unemployment rate above 8% was Franklin D Roosevelt.</p> <p>If the race for White House is about the economy \u2013 and American voters routinely say it is \u2013 Mitt Romney would be winning the election by a country mile and Obama contemplating joining George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter as one-term presidents of the modern era.</p> <p>Polling by the Pew Research Centre shows that only 41% of Americans say their own personal financial situation is excellent or good, while consumer confidence is lower than it was when Gerald Ford lost to Carter in 1976 and when Carter was turfed out by Ronald Reagan four years later. The last time Americans felt this gloomy was in 1992, and Bill Clinton won.</p> <p>The fact that real median incomes, a benchmark of how well the middle classes are doing, have dropped by 4.7% since Obama became president has allowed Romney to ask the question so tellingly posed by Reagan against Carter: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"</p> <p>If the well-off in the US were asked that question, the answer would be yes. The top 5% of earners, those making $186,000 (\u00a3115,000) or more, took 22.3% of national income in 2011, up from 21.3% in 2010.</p> <p>Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is greater than it has been since records began in 1975, making the US the fourth most unequal country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development after Chile, Mexico and Turkey. All this has got the pollsters scratching their heads.</p> <p>Bruce Stokes, fellow of the Pew Institute, said: \"Back in the spring, my assumption was that if unemployment remained above 8%, the president was going to lose. It has remained above 8% but despite that the president retains a great deal of public support, and that has grown in the last month.\"</p> <p>Obama has been helped in recent weeks by some tentative signs that the economy is on the mend. The recession in the real estate market \u2013 the worst the US has ever endured \u2013 appears to be at an end, with housing starts, home sales and property prices all on the rise.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has lifted share prices on Wall Street by announcing that the US central bank will continue to use monetary stimulus until there is clear evidence of sustained growth. An easing of the eurozone crisis has calmed fears that the economy might plunge off a cliff in the runup to election day.</p> <p>There is, though, perhaps more to it than that. Analysts at Capital Economics say that the darkest days for the US economy were in the months between Obama's election victory in November 2008 and his inauguration in early 2009 and that the economy is in much better shape now than it was then.</p> <p>\"At the end of 2008, GDP was falling at an annualised rate of 9%, over 700,000 jobs were being lost every month and the banking system was in meltdown,\" Capital Economics said.</p> <p>Polls show that many voters still blame Bush and the Republicans for the current weakness in the economy, while at the same time giving Obama credit for rescuing the US car industry when it was faced with bankruptcy.</p> <p>Even this, however, does not appear to be the whole story, as voters in the swing states appear to be planning to vote for Obama while at the same time believing that Romney would be just as good, if not better, at handling the economy.</p> <p>According to Stokes, the explanation may be that Obama is well ahead when it comes to other issues, such as healthcare and national security, and is also seen as a more likable candidate.</p> <p>Romney's only hope in the remaining weeks of the campaign is to make Obama's handling of the economy the key election issue. If he fails to do so, Obama looks likely to be re-elected.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"Health\">Health</a></h2> <p><strong>Obama's healthcare reform was arguably the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency, requiring Americans to buy health insurance and making sure people with pre-existing conditions got insurance. Republicans denounced the act as unaffordable, a violation of individual freedom. Romney pledged to repeal the care act in its entirety but now says there are a things he would keep \u2013 including allowing young adults to stay on parental policies until they are 25. In a trip to the US, the Guardian's health editor, Sarah Boseley, found plenty of beneficiaries of the Obama reforms</strong></p> <p>Dawn Josephson, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, fell foul of an insurance trap. In 2008 her son, Wesley, then two, woke up one morning with just the white of one eye showing and the iris of the other hardly visible. It was sudden-onset strabismus, caused by lack of co-ordination between eye muscles and the brain. His eyes were no longer focusing on the same point.</p> <p>They were paying $800 (\u00a3495) a month for health insurance for their family of four, with an excess of $1,500, and they were liable for 20% of their costs after that.</p> <p>Wesley had a surgical procedure costing about $8,000, although there was no overnight stay. With lab tests, the bills probably came to $12,000.</p> <p>\"About two months later, we got a nice little note from our insurance company saying, 'we are now terminating this policy and we have nothing else to offer you',\" she said. \"My husband and I are self-employed, so we have to get our own policy. We found another for about the same rate, but because Wesley had this pre-existing condition, anything relating to the eye was not covered. We were still going to the doctor every two months, paying anything from $600 to $1,000 for doctors' bills.\"</p> <p>The local Nemours children's hospital offered a payment scheme, so they ran up bills and paid a small monthly amount towards them.</p> <p>\"Around April 2010, we said, 'we can't do this any more, there has got to be an alternative',\" she said.</p> <p>An insurance agent found the family a cheaper policy, which at least saved them money for Wesley's bills.</p> <p>When Josephson called the insurance company to check on the policy, she was told everyone was covered, including Wesley. Josephson could not believe what she was hearing.</p> <p>\"For a split second I thought they made a mistake \u2013 just shut up and take the policy,\" she said. \"Then she said to me, 'we are no longer excluding pre-existing conditions for children'.\"</p> <p>On 23 March, Obama had signed the affordable care act into law. Wesley Josephson had just become one of the first beneficiaries.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"foreign\">Foreign policy</a></h2> <p><strong>Foreign policy did not figure much in the campaign, until the killing of the US ambassador to Libya this month. Since then the gloves have come off, writes Julian Borger, the Guardian's diplomatic editor</strong></p> <p>Mitt Romney said very little about foreign affairs on the stump but he seized on the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as an emblem of America's place in the world under Obama. He claimed that the US response to the wave of attacks on American diplomatic mission had been to apologise for the amateur video that had triggered them.</p> <p>It turned out he has his timings wrong and that a statement by the US embassy in Cairo condemning the video for its cynical portrayal of the prophet Muhammad had preceded the attacks.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign pressed on with the theme, seeking to cast the administration as apologising for American values abroad.</p> <p>The president appeared to slip in a television interview aired in which he described the riots as \"bumps in the road\" on the way to a functioning democracy.</p> <p>Romney responded quickly saying: \"These are not bumps in the road, these are human lives.\"</p> <p>The theme resonated because of popular perceptions of what was widely seen as ingratitude among the new north African democracies for American support for the Arab spring.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, claimed this week that the riots over the anti-Muslim video were a demonstration of how the Obama foreign policy was \"blowing up in our faces\".</p> <p>Ryan compared the scenes from north Africa to the 1979 Iranian revolution, implying a comparison between Obama and the Democratic president at the time, Jimmy Carter, the personification among American conservatives of weak, unpatriotic, leadership.</p> <p>Obama has sought to counter that narrative with his emphatic celebration of those values in this week's speech to the UN general assembly.</p> <p>On the bigger picture, that is some polling evidence that Obama has the edge.</p> <p>A new YouGov poll, seen by the Guardian, shows that, while a large majority of Republicans see their country locked in a zero-sum struggle with Islam, Americans as a whole rejects that view by 47% to 39%. Almost half those polled believe \"it is possible for the west and Muslims to coexist in peace\".</p> <p>Obama's UN speech mentioned in passing what the White House believes are its principal achievements abroad \u2013 the killing of Osama bin Laden, the withdrawal from Iraq, and the planned pullout from Afghanistan.</p> <p>The first aspect inoculates Obama from Republican attacks for lack of resolve over the other two. The slayer of America's enemy number one cannot easily be accused of being weak on security. Moreover, there is no political advantage to be gained in a war-weary America by arguing that the White House is cutting and running from foreign conflicts.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"immigration\">Immigration</a></h2> <p><strong>Immigration reform is one of the top issues for Latino voters. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the US are Latino. Obama won their overwhelming support in 2008, and polls show he should repeat this in November. Although he failed to deliver on his promise to introduce immigration reform, he has taken action, bypassing Congress, to give the children of some illegal immigrants relief from the threat of arrest. He has also promised reform in a second term. But as Ewen MacAskill and Ed Pilkington report, there is still a long way to go to prevent immigrants from falling foul of individual states taking matters into their own hands</strong></p> <p>Latinos living without immigration papers in Arizona have begun bombarding helplines and lawyers' offices with requests about how to provide for their children should they be arrested under the controversial new police power that came into effect last week.</p> <p>A phoneline hosted by the Arizona branch of the American Civil Liberties Union received almost 4,000 calls in two days, many from anxious parents who fear their children could be left abandoned should they be picked up under the \"show-me-your-papers\" provision.</p> <p>Hundreds have been asking for help setting up a power of attorney, which gives a relative or friend who has US citizenship the right to care for minors in such an eventuality.</p> <p>\"People are terrified. They fear that they will go to the store to buy groceries and won't get home, and their kids will be left alone at school,\" said Luz Santiago, a pastor in Mesa. She said she had personally handled about 50 requests for power of attorney so far.</p> <p>The \"show-me-your-papers\" clause is the most deeply contested of the provisions of SB 1070, an Arizona law passed in 2010 that has set the benchmark for a wave of hardline immigration laws clamping down on undocumented families in several states.</p> <p>Under its terms, police are required to investigate the immigration status of anyone they come across during their normal work and whom they suspect of being unauthorised.</p> <p>The law was snarled up in legal challenges that went up to the US supreme court. In June, the court struck down several elements of the legislation but allowed the clause to go ahead pending local Arizona court approval.</p> <p>That approval was granted this week and the provision is now in effect.</p> <p>Residents of Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, are braced for the rule change, having witnessed the impact of heavy-handed policing for years under Joe Arpaio, who calls himself \"America's toughest sheriff\".</p> <p>Groups working with undocumented Hispanics are more concerned about other smaller towns, such as Flagstaff and Prescott, which have large Latino populations but no experience of police officers acting as immigration agents.</p> <p>Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, is calling a forum next Tuesday in which community leaders will meet the police chief, Roberto Villasenor, to discuss the implementation of the clause.</p> <p>Regina Romero, who sits on the city council and convened the meeting, said the clear fear was that police would be drawn into racial profiling. \"We live 45 minutes from the Mexican border, so who else other than Mexicans are you going to be picking up? You are not going to be looking for Canadians in this part of the country,\" she said.</p> <p>Alessandra Soler, head of the ACLU in Arizona, said that there was already evidence that Tucson police were making contact inappropriately with US border patrol officers even for such mundane issues as help with translation.</p> <p>\"It's extremely problematic when you have local police contacting border patrol when there is no good reason.\"</p> <p>The ACLU and other groups have an outstanding civil rights action against SB 1070 still lodged with the state's appeal court. That legal attempt to put a stop to \"show me your papers\" will continue to pass through the courts, and the intention of opponents of the provision is to beef it up with real examples of racial profiling.</p> <p>Lydia Guzman, director of the hotline, said the aim now was to chronicle the impact of the law. \"The supreme court has given us the green light to present to the courts victims of racial profiling, so that's our challenge: show me the victims.\"</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"gender\">The gender gap</a></h2> <p><strong>Polls show women could be a crucial issue for the Democrats, with Romney lagging 20 points behind Obama with women voters, writes Karen McVeigh</strong></p> <p>Democrats tend to do better among women voters than Republicans, but even allowing for historical precedent, Romney is performing terribly with a demographic group whose votes can be decisive in swing states.</p> <p>The latest polls suggest that the gender gap this year could hit historic levels, with Romney trailing Obama by some 20 points among women nationally, and even more in some key battlegrounds.</p> <p>There are many policy related reasons behind the antipathy towards the Republicans among female voters. Women are more likely consider healthcare and social issues as important to their voting choice.</p> <p>But Romney has said that if elected he will repeal Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act, and social issues have persistently intruded on his campaign's attempts to focus on the economy.</p> <p>One of the defining Democrat attacks on the Republican candidate and his party has been over its \"war on women\", for policies on equal pay, domestic abuse, abortion and contraception.</p> <p>The drive by Republican lawmakers to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of cancer screening to women with low incomes, has alienated some female voters, as have attempts to restrict access to abortion.</p> <p>Romney has flipped his position on abortion, running as pro-choice in Massachusetts, before changing it to anti-choice when running for presidency in 2008.</p> <p>By picking Paul Ryan, one of the most staunch anti-abortion conservatives as running mate, Romney has alienated moderates. That tension was further exposed in August amid the furore over the \"legitimate rape\" comments of Senate candidate Todd Akin.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"funding\">Campaign finance</a></h2> <p><strong>Court rulings have given corporations and the super-rich a greater role in the elections than ever, writes Ed Pilkington</strong></p> <p>Super Pacs sound like a new child's toy. In fact, these new entities, arising from two court rulings, form the single most important innovation of the 2012 election cycle and are pumping a torrent of private and corporate money into the race.</p> <p>Formed in the wake of two controversial court rulings in 2010, Citizens United v FEC and Speechnow.org v FEC, Super Pacs \u2013 based on the traditional political action committees but able to engage in unlimited political spending outside campaigns \u2013 allow corporations, for the first time in more than 40 years, to use their financial muscle to influence an election.</p> <p>Super Pacs cannot directly fund candidates but they can support them with their own message.</p> <p>Collectively, Super Pacs have already spent $270m this year. The Republicans have the edge on spending, with billionaire donors such as Sheldon Adelson and Bob Perry wading in with tens of millions of dollars. The Republican Super Pac effort is being closely co-ordinated by George Bush's former svengali, Karl Rove.</p> <p>Obama has a Super Pac that supports his candidacy, Priorities USA, but it has raised $43m to the $97m raised by Restore Our Future, the Super Pac which backs Romney.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Kaiman depicts an increasingly ugly and intolerant Canada characterised by wanton environmental despoliation and paralysing political soul-searching (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/maple-leaf-what-ails-canada\" title=\"\">Maple leaf ragged: what ails Canada?</a>, 15 September). I suspect this verdict would surprise the nine out of 10 Canadians who recently told pollsters that \"Canada is the greatest country in the world\".</p> <p>It would also confound the many observers who recognise Canada's global economic leadership, with the strongest fiscal position in the G8.</p> <p>I will confine myself to correcting Kaiman's slanders against the most open and generous immigration system in the developed world. He claims that we are \"tightening\" immigration. In fact, our government has increased immigration to the highest sustained level in Canadian history, and the highest per-capita level in the developed world. He writes that we have \"radically adjusted the criteria for successful applications\", when in fact we are making our system more flexible, allowing skilled tradesmen, semi-skilled workers and foreign students to become permanent residents for the first time. He claims that we \"cut resettlement programmes en masse\", when in fact we are increasing our refugee resettlement programmes by 20% and have tripled funding for their integration.</p> <p>Kaiman wrongly suggests that we have \"eliminated all but the most basic healthcare for most refugee groups\", when in fact we will continue to fund healthcare for most refugees \u2013 such as those resettled from UN camps \u2013 more generously than Canada's general health service. He bemoans a fictitious \"harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants\", suggesting that there is something untoward about seeking to remove citizenship from people who obtained it fraudulently and have never lived in Canada. Far from \"harsh\", those who contest our efforts have access to an extensive process of judicial reviews and appeals.</p> <p>Kaiman laments our refusal rate for citizenship when, in fact, our overall acceptance rate last year was 92%. We are also proud to have the highest naturalisation rate in the developed world, with 85% of permanent residents eventually becoming full citizens. Finally, Kaiman imagines that the number of immigrants to Canada from China and India has halved in the last six years, when in fact it has remained constant, with an annual average of 28,000 permanent residents from India, and an annual average of 30,000 permanent residents from China between 2006 and 2010 (the last full year of available data).</p> <p>Kaiman's imaginary 50% reduction in Asian immigration is the basis of his most outrageous claim, that \"the changes point to a deep-rooted, yet widely ignored undercurrent of racism in Canadian society\". While no society can claim to be entirely free of prejudice, Canada is the only major western democracy without a xenophobic or anti-immigration political movement, and consistently records the highest levels of public tolerance for ethnic, religious and cultural diversity in the developed world.</p> <p>Canada is frequently lauded as a model of peaceful pluralism. Our government's recent reforms have made Canada more open to legitimate immigrants but harder on those seeking to abuse our generosity. It is a pity that&#xa0;Kaiman has aligned himself with the radical fringe of racial grievance-mongers in mistaking the rule of law \u2013 the backbone of a free and open society \u2013 for discrimination.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>A 21-year-old man arrested at a flat in Pimlico, central London, has become the first person to be jailed under the government's anti-squatting legislation.</p> <p>Alex Haigh, originally from Plymouth, has been sentenced to 12 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to occupying a housing association flat without permission.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Haigh was the first person to be given a custodial sentence under section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, which came into force on the first day of September.</p> <p>West London magistrates heard that police officers had gone to the flat in Cumberland Street on 2 September in search of another man. They arrested three people, one of whom was Haigh, on suspicion of squatting and all three have been convicted; the other two are awaiting sentence.</p> <p>The law criminalises squatting in residential premises. Housing charities have warned that it may trigger a surge in homelessness as squatters are forced on to the streets in order to avoid a criminal record.</p> <p>The squatters' rights group Squash (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes), which campaigned against criminalisation, condemned the sentencing as \"deeply disproportionate and unjust\". It said the building the men were occupying had been empty for more than a year.</p> <p>Haigh's father, Hugh, told the Evening Standard newspaper that his son, an apprentice bricklayer, had come to London in July seeking work. \"They have made an example of him.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. In times of stress, it's important to remind yourself of the positive things in your life. Provided you can find them, that is; if you can't then theguardian.com is not legally responsible for the tears you are about to haemorrhage. Anyway, yes. The positives. I'm alive. I have my own teeth. (Apart from that one I had booted out during a zesty five-a-side game at the Westway in 2004, but still.) I'm vaguely continent. It's X-Factor/Strictly season. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee925OTFBCA#t=0m29s\">Life is good</a>.</p> <p>The same is true of England's Twenty20 team. As that oft forgotten line in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI\">Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen) </a>by Baz Luhrmann tells us: <em>even if you have just been bowled out for 80 after giving one of the most farcical displays of batting against spin in years, remember you are still world champions and No2 in the ICC Rankings</em>. Then he said something about dancing the funky chicken and enjoying the power and beauty of your youth; I forget precisely what.</p> <p>England were a gift to comedy in that match against India, eleven Karl Pilkingtons floundering in an alien environment. The witless ineptitude of their performance was unique to English teams, under pressure, against spin, in Asia. If it would invite ridicule to say they don't have problems against spin, then nor is the problem as straightforward as you might think. England played Sunil Narine outstandingly in the summer; in 2011, they averaged 82.73 against spin in Tests. </p> <p>They do seem to have an mental block playing spin in Asia but it need not be insurmountable \u2013 especially as the best spinners (Ajmal, Ashwin) are in the other group, and their Super Eights games will be played on a cracking pitch in Pallekele. It might be a stretch for the non-Hackett customers among us to envisage England winning the tournament; they are, however, well capable of reaching the semi-finals at least.</p> <p>To do that, they probably need to win two of their three Super Eights matches. (You can go through with one win and go out with two, but two wins out of three is a decent target. Yes, I will sneak back in next week and delete this back if England win two games and go out.) The first is against the Calypso <em>galacticos</em> of the Twenty20 age: Chris Gayle, Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine, <strike> Johnson Charles </strike>, Dwayne Bravo and the rest. England beat them impressively when the two sides met in June, with Alex Hales making 99. Then again, that game was in England. In short, nobody knows anything, reading this preamble has been a complete waste of your time, and we're all doomed. There's your positive!</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>The first Super Eights game between Sri Lanka and New Zealand</strong> has gone to a Super Over after an amazing finale. It was decided by a run-out review off the final delivery that necessitated at least 20 replays. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/27/sri-lanka-new-zealand-world-twenty20-live\">Join James Riach right here, right now</a>.</p> <p>The toss for this match has been delayed as a result.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.43pm</strong> The start to this match will be delayed as we are only halfway through the Super Over. Sri Lanka made 13 from theirs; New Zealand need 14 to win. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/27/sri-lanka-new-zealand-world-twenty20-live\">Follow it all here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>SRI LANKA HAVE BEATEN NEW ZEALAND BY SIX RUNS IN THE SUPER OVER</strong>. That's a serious thrashing in a one-over game. A memorable match has ended an hour after the scheduled finish time. Neither side managed to hit a boundary in the Super Over, with Lasith Malinga's death-bowling skill decisive. What a fantastic start to the Super Eights stage.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Right, to business</strong>. We've had the thriller; now it's time for the comedy.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>West Indies have won the toss</strong> and will bat first. England have brought in Samit Patel for Tim Bresnan. West Indies have resisted the temptation to play 11 spinners, although they have brought in the inexperienced 31-year-old legspinner Samuel Badree.</p> <p>Badree has an interesting backstory: he made his first-class debut in January 2002 but has played only 12 first-class matches in nearly 11 years. His career was ignited by the advent of Twenty20, however, and he has a sensational domestic T20 record: an average of 17.20 and an economy rate of 4.59. <strike> He's up against some of the world's best players of spin today though. </strike></p> <p><strong>England</strong> Kieswetter (wk), Hales, Wright, Morgan, Bairstow, Buttler, Patel, Broad (c), Swann, Finn, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>West Indies</strong> Charles, Gayle, Samuels, Dwayne Bravo, Pollard, Ramdin (wk), Russell, Sammy (c), Rampaul, Narine, Badree.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3.11pm</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/27/drugs-live-the-ecstasy-trial-channel-4-review\">Did anyone watch Drugs Live last night</a>? What actually happened? If not, don't worry: the Guardian have allowed me to do this OBO on MDMA in the name of scientific, journalistic and social experimentation.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The good news for England</strong> is that <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/51880.html?class=\" 3;opposition=\"1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings&quot;&quot;\">Chris Gayle has not really fired against them</a> in Twenty20 cricket. The bad news for England is that <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/51880.html?class=\" 3;opposition=\"1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings&quot;&quot;\">Chris Gayle has not really fired against them</a> in Twenty20 cricket. Henry is due.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3.18pm</strong> The game will start at <strong>3.40pm</strong>. Eff sake. Some of us have a dinner reservation tonight, you ICC swine.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> \"Dinner reservation,\" sniffs Paul Wakefield. \"I didn't know McDonald's did reservations?\" I've been watching too much Frasier. Everything's a dinner reservation or an opera to me these days.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.33pm</strong> \"Any idea why they're using Super Overs in the group stages?\" says Josh Robinson. \"Surely since we're not yet in the knockout rounds, tied games could happily be left with the points split. Couldn't they?\" No idea. Hope this helps!</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>So now then</strong>, who should open the bowling against Enery Gayle? Steven Finn is a must, and Nasser Hussain has suggested Graeme Swann, which is a decent idea. I suspect it'll be Finn and Jade Dernbach though.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1st over: West Indies 6-0 (Charles 6, Gayle 0)</strong> Steven Finn will open the bowling. He nailed Enery nice and early in <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/534208.html\">the last T20 match between the sides</a>. This time he starts to Johnson Charles, who works a couple into the leg side, fresh-airs an on-the-run haymaker, has a tentative sniff at a sharp lifter and finally top edges an attempted pull high over slip for a one-bounce four. Six from the over, but it was a very good one from Finn.</p> <p>\"Whatever happens in the next few hours, at least there's been one England win today,\" says Clare Davies. \"<a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-womens-world-twenty20-2012/engine/current/match/533301.html\">Our girls beat Pakistan</a> despite doing a fine impression of the men with their middle order collapse. Still if the openers this afternoon can emulate Laura and Charlotte and put on 99, then we could be in with a shout of a win.\" Bowling figures of 4-9, like Holly Colvin's, wouldn't exactly harsh the England buzz either.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2nd over: West Indies 20-0 (Charles 6, Gayle 12)</strong> It is Jade Dernbach at the other end. He starts with a short ball that Gayle avoids. Enjoy the dot ball, Jade, because you might not have too many today. Mind you, Gayle usually takes 10 deliveries to get his eye in. Make that three deliveries; after two dot balls, he mangles Dernbach through midwicket for four. The fifth ball, a slower short one, is pulled zestily over square leg for a one-bounce four, and Gayle completes a 14-run over by timing an attempted yorker back whence it came to the fence. Stunning batting from Gayle, who has 12 from 6 balls. The beast has woken early today.</p> <p>\"Given that Gayle starts slowly, which is a pleasing aesthetic,\" begins Elliot Carr-Barnsley, \"is lobbing down some slow full tosses a cavalierly brilliant idea?\" No idea. Hope this helps!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3rd over: West Indies 26-0 (Charles 6, Gayle 17)</strong> Johnson Charles is the Starsky to Gayle's Hutch, the Pepsi to his Shirlie (or is it the other way round?), the Wetherspoons Mixed Grill to his Hawksmoor Ribeye. He takes a single to put Gayle on strike against Finn for the first time&#xa0;\u2013 and Gayle plays a preposterous stroke, backing away to smash a short ball over extra cover for four. It's time to assert the offensively obvious: England really need Gayle's wicket here.</p> <p>\"Is it spin bowling which so flummoxes England's batsmen or merely slow bowling?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Seems that the more time they have to think as the ball leaves the hand eventually to plop down on to the earth, the more trouble they have. And does anyone know if KP becomes all tongue-tied and hesitant at the mic when a left-arm spinner comes on?\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>4th over: West Indies 37-0 (Charles 11, Gayle 22)</strong> Ach! Broad almost dismisses Gayle with his first ball. He banged it in short outside leg stump; Gayle tried to cuff it through midwicket but instead edged it high over short third man for four. This is a fantastic pitch, with the Sky commentators generally agreeing that a score of around 180 is par. West Indies are on course for that and more at the moment. Johnson Charles pings a very full delivery past backward point four, despite a very good effort from the sliding Bairstow on the boundary. I'm not sure that should have been four you know, and if England lose by two runs (Gayle only jogged a couple) we might hear more about it.</p> <p>\"Drugs Live,\" says Gordon Pittendrigh. \"Yes, I wasted some of my life watching Keith Allen take drugs and be ... well, Keith Allen.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>5th over: West Indies 40-0 (Charles 14, Gayle 23)</strong> England are hitting Gayle with plenty of short stuff, although it's only really the high bouncer that tends to give him <em>agita</em>. Finn kicks the stumps in the course of his second delivery; Asad Rauf tells him that any repeat will be a dead ball. It's an excellent over though; only three from it, with four dot balls. Splendid stuff. Gayle has 23 from 13 balls; Charles has 14 from 17.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>6th over: West Indies 47-0 (Charles 14, Gayle 28)</strong> Gayle flicks Broad over midwicket for four with devastating timing. That aside it's another good over for England, even though Johnson Charles is very fortunate to survive a huge LBW shout. That might be a blessing for England because Charles is struggling to get it off the square, or whatever the T20 upgrade of that phrase should be.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>7th over: West Indies 53-0 (Charles 19, Gayle 29)</strong> Here comes Graeme Swann. He has been in wonderful form in Twenty20 cricket since ... well, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/20431.html?class=3;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings\">pretty much since ever</a>. Gayle has a look at his first ball, which turns sharply off the pitch, and works the third off his pads for a single. Johnson Charles then gives Swann the charge, heaving a boundary to cow corner. \"Hit out or get out,\" says Nasser Hussain. Charles's current strike rate of 90 isn't enough on this pitch.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>8th over: West Indies 72-0 (Charles 20, Gayle 47)</strong> Samit Patel is sweating. This much you know. But he'll be perspiring a bit more now because he has to bowl at Chris Gayle. Fret not, Samit, what's the worst that can happen? Oh. Gayle has smashed Patel for three sixes in four balls! The first was pulled over deep midwicket, the second flicked high over square leg and the third clouted miles over midwicket. Well, 96 metres to be precise; it was a monstrous blow, the second biggest six of the tournament. Nineteen runs from the over. This is awesome batting.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>9th over: West Indies 90-0 (Charles 37, Gayle 48)</strong> Nasser reckons 160 will be a tricky target, with the ball stopping a bit in the pitch for the spinners. England are in the malodorous stuff, then, not least because Swann is now going round the park. His second over has just disappeared for 18, but this time it's Johnson Charles doing the damage. He pulls four round the corner, follows that with the sweetest driven six over long on, and then drives another over midwicket to finish a huge over.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>10th over: West Indies 95-0 (Charles 39, Gayle 51)</strong> Kieswetter has a desperate, lone appeal for a catch when Gayle whips at Dernbach's first delivery. Replays weren't really conclusive either way. A single later in the over brings him to another awesome fifty, from just 29 balls. It's not totally sacrilegious to call him the Bradman of Twenty20; his record is just outrageous. Five from Dernbach's over, all singles.</p> <p>\"This isn't fair,\" says Sarah Dickens. \"Not only is Gayle feasting on Patel's pies, he's just run a quick single!\" You can't call that <em>running</em>. Chris Gayle is from the Junior Soprano school: \"<em>we don't run</em>\".</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 103-1 (Gayle c Finn b Swann 58)</strong> Swann enjoys two dot balls to Gayle, but he doesn't enjoy them so much when Gayle monsters the next over extra cover for his fourth six. And now Finn has dropped Charles! For heaven's sake, the comedy roadshow is back. This was a relative dolly, running in from long off. The look on Swann's coupon! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swannyg66/status/248765207072083969\">He looks like he's just eaten his own spaghetti bolognese</a>. England are in danger of falling apart here \u2013 but Finn takes a much more difficult chance next ball to get rid of Chris Gayle! All's well that ends well, at least until West Indies post 200. Gayle slaughtered Swann high in the air towards deep midwicket (I think). Wherever it was, Finn backpedalled sharply to take a really good face-high catch. It knocked him off his feet but he held on.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>11th over: West Indies 103-1 (Charles 40, Samuels 0)</strong> \"Chris Gayle is essentially a superior version of Craig Kieswetter \u2014 both absorb an unusually high number of dot balls at the beginning of their innings in the belief that, once they've played themselves in, they'll be able to lift their initially anaemic strike rate to a more than acceptable level by smacking boundaries,\" says SB Tang. \"Gayle's just a bit better at it than Kieswetter.\" Just a bit. Do you reckon Kieswetter deliberately absorbs dot balls? He does sometimes \u2013 he isn't afraid to shoulder arms \u2013 but it's also partially that he hasn't developed his game yet.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>12th over: West Indies 114-1 (Charles 49, Samuels 1)</strong> Johnson Charles is into his stride now. His first ball from the new bowler Luke Wright is scorched for four, inside out through extra cover. A languid drive back over the bowler's head brings him another boundary two balls later. Even with the loss of Chris Gayle, West Indies are well placed to get 200.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>13th over: West Indies 118-1 (Charles 52, Samuels 2)</strong> Charles laps Patel for a single to his first international T20 fifty, a two-paced effort from 36 balls. He scored 21 from his first 24 balls and 29 from the next 12. Patel's second over goes for only four; England desperately needed an order-restorer like that.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 118-2 (Samuels c Morgan b Broad 2)</strong> This is excellent work from Stuart Broad. He bowls four consecutive dot balls to Marlon Samuels, the last of which also brings a wicket when Samuels slaps one to the leaping Morgan at backward point. Samuels made two from eight balls.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>14th over: West Indies 118-2 (Charles 52, Pollard 0)</strong> With Down Under by Men At Work playing in the background, <strike> Simon Whitlock </strike> Kieron Pollard swaggers to the wicket. He is beaten by his first ball, waving lazily at a short one, and ignores the second. So that's a wicket maiden from Broad. We talk about captain's innings but we never reckon about captain's spells, do we? Or captain's overs, or captain's dot balls? Anyway, that was very good from Broad. Meanwhile, the Sky commentator, Alan Wilkins I think, has just shared a wonderful stat: in T20 cricket, Kieron Pollard has hit more sixes (206) than fours (184). That is utterly absurd. </p> <p>\"This match sounds pretty lively, complete with the requisite cast of butter-fingered Englishmen,\" says Michael Jelley. \"My friend Ed and I are heading in for an audition for Pointless, and thought you and your adoring public might have some top Pointless facts for us to wow them with...\" 65.00?</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>15th over: West Indies 128-2 (Charles 61, Pollard 1)</strong> Pollard, still on nought, slices Patel high over backward point, and the ball lands tantalisingly between three fielders. After four runs from the first five balls, Charles charges down the track and smokes Patel for another glorious six over long on. \"Ksake!\" shouts one of the England team, probably Patel. That travelled 95 metres, just three short of the biggest in the tournament so far.</p> <p>\"Is anyone else horribly frustrated at not having access to the commentary featuring <strike> Satan </strike> KP?\" says Oliver Smiddy. \"A penny for his thoughts now... Woeful selection mind. It still amazes me we'd defend the trophy without the likes of Shah, Anderson and <strike> Beelzebub </strike> KP.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 128-3 (Pollard c Wright b Finn 1)</strong> This is a big wicket for England. Pollard drives Finn a million miles in the air towards the cover boundary, where Luke Wright gets down on one knee to calmly take the catch. Pollard made 1 from 5 balls, and he and Samuels made 3 from 13 between them. Yet West Indies are still on course for a mighty total.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>16th over: West Indies 140-3 (Charles 73, Dwayne Bravo 1)</strong> You know that attempted gag at Johnson Charles' expense in the preamble? I'm sorry. It was me wot done it. Charles is playing sensationally now and has just taken Finn for consecutive boundaries to third man and square leg. He made 21 from his first 24 balls; he has made 52 from the last 24.</p> <p>\"Danger man: Andre Russell,\" says Harry Tuttle. \"His batting has come on leaps and bounds since the World Cup. He is arguably a bigger hitter than Gayle.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>17th over: West Indies 146-3 (Charles 76, Dwayne Bravo 2)</strong> Apart from being boom-boomed for four sixes, Samit Patel has bowled a fairly decent spell. That's not quite as stupid as it sounds. The other 20 balls went for 14 runs, and he has just bowled his final over at a cost of six singles. He ends with figures of 4-0-38-0.</p> <p>\"'It's also partially that he hasn't developed his game yet',\" says Ian Copestake of that earlier comment about Kieswetter. \"The hours of hard yakka at euphemism school really paid off there. Well done that man.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 154-4 (Charles c Bairstow b Dernbach 84)</strong> A stonking innings from Johnson Charles, who I've always rated, comes to an end when he clobbers Dernbach to Bairstow at long on. Charles made 84 from 56 balls with 10 fours and three sixes. He belted 63 from his last 32 deliveries.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>18th over: West Indies 154-4 (Dwayne Bravo 2, Sammy 0)</strong> That was the last ball of the over. \"Charles has now <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2012/content/current/player/333066.html\">scored his highest score in any professional format anywhere in a T20 International</a>,\" says Tom Bowtell. \"Can't be many people for whom that can be said.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! West Indies 158-5 (Sammy b Broad 4)</strong> Beautiful bowling from Stuart Broad. Darren Sammy heaves all around a slower ball that bounces gently into the stumps. Some hot captain-on-captain action, then, and there are nine balls remaining.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>19th over: West Indies 164-4 (Dwayne Bravo 2, Russell 6)</strong> Russell is fortunate to top-edge the slower bouncer for four. Broad, who has been the pick of the England bowlers by a distance, ends with figures of 4-1-26-2.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>20th over: West Indies 179-5 (Dwayne Bravo 11, Russell 10)</strong> Swann hasn't bowled his four overs, which is very unusual, but then nor has England's 20th-over specialist Jade Dernbach. His last over, the usual slow-evenslower-quick affair, disappears for 15. Russell edges a boundary to third man; Bravo drills another back over the bowler's head and then smashes a flamboyant drive over extra cover for four more. The upshot is that England need precisely <strong>180</strong> to win. It's a good pitch but, in the parlance of our time, the task is seriously stiff and the ask is seriously big. See you in 10 minutes for England's reply.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 0-1 (Kieswetter c Pollard b Rampaul 0)</strong> Well this is going well. Craig Kieswetter has fallen second ball for nought. He was beaten for pace by Ravi Rampaul and top-edged an ugly pull straight to Pollard at point.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 0-2 (Wright c Gayle b Rampaul 0)</strong> Laughter <em>is</em> the best medicine. Luke Wright has gone for a golden duck and England are in disarray. He tried to leave a short ball from Rampaul but was too late on the aborted stroke; the ball went off the face of the bat to the left of slip, where Chris Gayle took an excellent low catch and celebrated with his usual dance.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 0-2 (target 180; Hales 0, Bairstow 0)</strong> Jonny Bairstow has been promoted above Eoin Morgan. Rampaul completes a double-wicket maiden. It seems England don't have a problem with slow bowlers; they just have a problem with bowlers.</p> <p>\"This is going to be nail-bitingly brilliant,\" says Nick Barrett. \"Forget chasing down the Windies' total, are England going to be bowled out for the lowest-ever T20 total or not? This is what being an England fan is about; God how I've missed it.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 2-2 (target 180; Hales 1, Bairstow 1)</strong> The legspinner Samuel Badree will share the new ball, and he hurries through his first over at a cost of two runs. England's required rate is up to 9.88. Already.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 8-2 (target 180; Hales 2, Bairstow 6)</strong> Bairstow swivel-pulls Rampaul almost angrily for four through midwicket. He then takes a very dodgy single to mid-on, and would have been out with a direct hit from Dwayne Bravo. Hales inside-edges the next ball past the stumps. The required rate is into double figures. This is grim.</p> <p>\"Just switched on the telly to be greeted by the giant screen yelling ON A HAT TRICK and Chris Gayle dancing in the slips,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Maybe England should just bat out their overs and finish on 60 for two? Probably marginally less embarrassing that way.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 17-2 (target 180; Hales 11, Bairstow 6)</strong> That's a classy stroke from Hales, an on-the-run drive through extra cover for four off Badree, and he makes it consecutive boundaries with a cut through the lumbering Gayle at short third man. England need to hang in this game and hope for something ludicrous from Eoin Morgan or Jos Buttler.</p> <p>\"While it's clear this format makes aggressive batters tumescent, are there any bowlers who live for it?\" says Ian Copestake. \"Seems they must be masochists for all the kicks they will get from wickets taken in between being whacked all over the shop.\" Ravi Rampaul. Next.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 25-2 (target 180; Hales 17, Bairstow 8)</strong> Sunil Narine comes into the attack. England can't sit on him today, not with the required rate in double figures. I suppose they would be happy with figures of 4-0-30-1. Hales edges a cut in the air but wide of short third man for four; Narine's first over goes for eight. England will take that.</p> <p>\"I think there's a bright side to be looked on here,\" says Josh Robinson. \"It usually takes Kieswetter a lot more than two balls to get out for a duck, and Wright has evidently decided that England's best hope of chasing down this total is to have Bairstow, Morgan and Buttler at the crease for as long as possible.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 29-2 (target 180; Hales 18, Bairstow 11)</strong><br>A good over from the legspinner Badree, full of quicker deliveries, goes for only four. That's the end of the Powerplay, which was directed by Lars Von Trier and soundtracked by Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah.</p> <p>\"I knew the last 10 or so years were just a temporary blip,\" says Matt Emerson. \"Goodbye professionalism, welcome back abject shambles. You've been missed by all true England cricket supporters.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 41-2 (target 180; Hales 27, Bairstow 15)</strong> I had to cancel my bloody dinner reservation for this as well. Hales swivel pulls the new bowler Sammy for a smooth flat six. He's actually playing very well. If he hadn't faced his first ball at 0 for 2 England might be in serious danger of having a vague chance of winning this game. Maybe they still have one. Sammy's first over goes for 13, with Bairstow ramping the last delivery for four. England need 139 from 13 overs.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 49-2 (target 180; Hales 32, Bairstow 15)</strong> Ramdin iron-gloves a stumping chance when Hales runs at Badree and misses. Ramdin was unsighted but should probably have reacted quicker. Badree's final over costs eight and, in the context of a high-scoring game*, West Indies will be well pleased with his spell: 4-0-20-0.</p> <p><em>* Theoretically.</em></p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 53-2 (target 180; Hales 34, Bairstow 17)</strong> Hales brings up the fifty, and the fifty partnership, with a single off Narine. That's one of only four singles from an excellent over. England need 127 from 66 balls. Oof.</p> <p>\"Bairstow may be better walking off,\" says Andrew Hurley. \"He is really struggling.\" I'm a bit worried about him in the Tests in India, especially if they prepare bunsens. He is essentially brilliant, though. It's just that we might need to be patient with some of those young English batsmen over the next two years. And we know how patient English cricket fans are.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 55-3 (Bairstow c Pollard b Gayle 18)</strong> Chris Gayle comes on to bowl his 50mph yorkers. I'm surprised he doesn't bowl more in limited-overs cricket because he often seems devilishly hard to hit. When Bairstow does try to clout him down the ground, Pollard takes an outrageous running catch at long-on. What a take! Bairstow smashed the ball perfectly straight; it seemed to be going for six but Pollard ran round the boundary to take a nonchalant two-handed catch above his head. Chris Gayle starts jigging at the crease again. He's on the dancefloor, and England are getting a touch-up. Bairstow made a scratchy 18 from 29 balls.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 55-3 (target 180; Hales 35, Morgan 0)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYamMpAAR7k&amp;feature=relmfu#t=25m47s\">That was the last ball of the over</a>.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 66-3 (target 180; Hales 37, Morgan 7)</strong> Ramdin misses another stumpin chance. This was slightly more difficult. The new bowler Samuels saw Hales coming and speared a yorker down the leg side. It hit Ramdin's pads and deflected away. You've just dropped the World Twenty20, mate!</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 72-3 (target 180; Hales 41, Morgan 9)</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZOurX6BMg4\">Here's exclusive footage of Kevin Pietersen's analysis of England's performance</a>.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 86-3 (target 180; Hales 54, Morgan 10)</strong> Samuels' second over goes for 14. Hales screams him down the ground and then sweet-spots a six over midwicket to reach his fifty from 36 balls. His innings has been very good; it's just that the others have made 28 for three from 39 balls.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 96-3 (target 180; Hales 56, Morgan 17)</strong> Eoin Morgan backs up too far, so Chris Gayle gives him a warning by... actually I've no idea how to describe what he did. He stood by the stumps waving the ball around with a huge smile on his face. No teeth were visible later in the over when Morgan hoicked a low full toss for six. Ultimately, however, that was a decent over for the West Indies; ten from it. England need 84 from 36 balls.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 110-3 (target 180; Hales 59, Morgan 28)</strong> Sunil Narine returns to the attack. How do you hit Narine for 14 runs per over? Swiping him straight down the ground for six, as Eoin Morgan just has, is a decent starting point. A flurry of ones and twos mean that England do take 14 from the over. They need 70 off 30 balls \u2013&#xa0;or precisely 14 an over.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 119-3 (need 61 from 24 balls; Hales 61, Morgan 35)</strong> A handy final over from Gayle goes for only nine. Hales, sent back by Morgan, survives a tight run-out referral thanks to a desperate dive. Morgan muscles four to long on, aided by a rare misfield from Pollard, and then top edges a sweep that goes over the keeper's head and somehow lands safely.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 134-3 (need 46 from 18 balls; Hales 62, Morgan 49)</strong> Ravi Rampaul comes back to bowl only the fourth over of pace in the innings. Morgan top edges a slog sweep for six \u2013 and then Russell saves four runs with an amazing piece of fielding. Morgan picked Rampaul up over the square leg boundary, apparently for six, but Russell, leaping backwards over the fence, caught the ball and threw it back into play before his feet touched the ground. If we tried that we would pull muscles we didn't know existed. England do still get 15 from the over, however, with Morgan running outside off stump to ramp a boundary over short fine leg. Morgan, who has played superbly, has 49 from 24 balls.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 141-3 (need 39 from 12 balls; Hales 65, Morgan 52)</strong> Sunil Narine replaces Chris Gayle. Morgan drags a single to reach a 25-ball fifty, but it's an excellent and probably match-winning over from Narine. Just seven from it, none in boundaries, so now England need 39 from two overs. Hales looks shattered.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 157-3 (need 23 from 6 balls; Hales 68, Morgan 65)</strong> England are just about still in this game. They need 23 from six balls \u2013&#xa0;23 from six balls! \u2013 after Rampaul's final over went for 16. Morgan swished a lovely six over long-off before beasting another \u2013 his fifth six of the innings \u2013 over wide mid-on. He has 65 from only 32 balls. Crucially, Rampaul's over contained two dot balls as well.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>19.1 overs: England 161-3 (need 19 from 5 balls)</strong> Marlon Samuels will bowl the final over, an inspired/catastrophic decision from the captain Darren Sammy. Morgan is on strike, and he will probably have to take all six balls if England are to win. Three sixes and a four and a two will do it. Morgan hammers the first ball down the ground for four despite a wonderful attempt to save from Pollard at long-off.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>19.2 overs: England 161-3 (need 19 from 4 balls)</strong> A dot ball. A yorker that Morgan couldn't get away. That should be that.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>19.3 overs: England 162-3 (need 18 from 3 balls)</strong> A single to extra cover. Hales needs three consecutive sixes to win the match.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 162-4 (Hales st Ramdin b Samuels 70)</strong> It's all over. Hales is stumped off Samuels, who bowled a clever yorker wide of off stump. Hales just ran past it. He played well to make 68 from 51 balls, although he ran out of steam towards the end.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 164-4. WEST INDIES WIN BY 15 RUNS</strong> That's it. England fought back well, with Eoin Morgan making a stunning 71 not out from 36 balls, but in the end they were comfortably beaten. Morgan needed to come in at No4, although I can understand why England held him back in what were unique circumstances. They have much to think about before they meet New Zealand on Saturday. It's likely, though not certain, that the loser of that game, won't make it through to the semi-finals. See you for that game. Thanks for your emails; night.</p>",
  "<p>Multibillion-pound mergers are normally hammered out in the glass and steel towers of the City and Wall Street. But the \u00a329bn merger of Britain's arms dealer BAE Systems and Franco-German aviation firm EADS is being fought over in corridors of power across the world.</p> <p>The marriage of BAE, which sold \u00a319bn worth of fighter jets, submarines, drones and other defence equipment last year, with EADS, the owner of jet builder Airbus and Eurocopter helicopters, would create the world's biggest defence and aviation firm with 223,000 staff across more than 50 countries.</p> <p>The companies are desperate for the deal to go ahead because it will give BAE some respite from savage defence spending cuts across the world while EADS is hoping to use BAE's trusted position in America to expand its presence in the world's largest defence market.</p> <p>But this is no ordinary business deal. \"It's the biggest redrawing of global defences since the cold war,\" said Robin Niblett, director of international affairs thinktank Chatham House.</p> <p>Yesterday the German defence minister Thomas de Maiziere underlined the political complexities when he said he believed the deal could not be finalised before the Takeover Panel deadline of 10 October.</p> <p>\"Perhaps we need more time. It depends on the answers for our questions and so I think we need more time,\" he said. His comments came after the leak of a German economy ministry document this week betraying German doubts about the 60/40 merger weighting between EADS and BAE.</p> <p>Guy Anderson, chief analyst at IHS Jane's Defence Industry, said the proposed merger is the biggest industry shake up since the \"infamous so-called Last Supper\" 1993 meeting between the US Department of Defense and industry leaders which led to the merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta and Northrop and Grumman in the US.</p> <p>\"[The proposed merger] is absolutely stunning,\" Anderson said. \"The scale of what they will own is massive. The sun will not set on a BEADS [as the combined company has been dubbed] office.\"</p> <p>World leaders are not going to sit idly by and watch the future of their defence policies redrawn before their eyes. \"The UK, France, Germany, the US, Australia, Saudi Arabia \u2026 every man and his dog will want a say in this,\" Anderson said. \"We will get to a state of having to have a British CEO with a French grandmother \u2026?\"</p> <p>The first step requires the UK, which holds a potential deal blocking \"golden share\" in BAE, to hammer out an agreement with France and Germany, which directly and indirectly each hold a 22.225% stake each in EADS. Under the current plans, the newly merged group would issue special golden shares to each of the French, German and British governments to replace their current ownership structures.</p> <p>While not addressing it specifically, the prime minister has already let it be known he supports the deal. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, has come out publicly in support of the deal stating: \"I personally have always been in favour, over time, of greater consolidation in the European defence industry.\"</p> <p>Vince Cable, the business secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/05/bae-systems-arms-deal-corruption\" title=\"\">who was savagely critical of BAE over bribery allegations whilst in opposition in 2010</a>, said: \"It is a very, very important decision and has major implications for the country, both in terms of employment and national security. We will have to look at the costs and benefits very, very carefully.\"</p> <p>Cable may be called on to investigate public interest concerns surrounding the deal as he was with News Corporation's proposed takeover of BSkyB.</p> <p>Liam Fox, the former defence secretary until he was forced to resign last year following revelations about his working relationship with his friend and self-styled adviser Adam Werritty, has also publicly supported the deal.</p> <p>The only stumbling block in the UK so far is a defence select committee investigation, which has asked for interested parties to submit written evidence by 9 October, one day before the companies have to submit merger proposals or request an extension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396843817\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/27/1348767179977/BAE-and-EADS-001.png\" alt=\"BAE and EADS\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BAE and EADS Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's a different story across the channel. A committee of MPs in Germany this week warned Tom Enders, the daredevil former paratrooper and current chief executive of EADS, that they may block the deal from going ahead.</p> <p>Kerstin Andreae, a member of the German parliament's economic committee, said the German government had several \"disagreements\" with Enders' vision, which would greatly reduce politicians' influence over the future direction of the company.</p> <p>\"More questions were left open than answered,\" she said of Enders' briefing to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.</p> <p>Enders, who has long battled against political interference at EADS, said: \"We want to create a company that is even more successful internationally and attracts investors. There are lots of examples in this industry of companies that do not have to be influenced by politics.\"</p> <p>Enders, who promised there would be no relocation of EADS's German businesses, appears to have won the support of Germany's deputy economy minister Hans-Joachim Otto, who said the proposed company should be subject to less political influence than EADS has been.</p> <p>But Otto stuck to the German position that the proposed terms giving BAE shareholders 40% and EADS shareholders 60% of the combined company undervalued EADS.</p> <p>Niblett said the fact that Germany is addressing the issue is a healthy sign for the deal. The silence from Paris is more worrying. \"France is feeling weaker relative to Germany. Hollande, who is having a rocky time of it any way, has got to be very careful about how this is presented. If there are any questions about jobs or a decline in France's presence on the national stage it will be very hard for him.</p> <p>\"If France and Germany can't find a way through there won't be a deal,\" he said. \"Even if companies believe they can present a deal the French and Germans can accept they then have to get it past America.\"</p> <p>BAE is in the enviable position of being the only foreign owned company to be one of the big six suppliers to the US Department of Defense.</p> <p>By building up a trusted relationship with US politicians, BAE has been able to expand its US subsidiary, BAE Systems Inc, into a $14bn-a-year business employing 40,000 people in more than half of the states and works on very sensitive projects including the $1.5 trillion F-35 joint strike fighter programme to build a jet that can avoid surface-to-air missiles.</p> <p>Anderson explains that BAE has only been able to build up its high-ranking \"special security arrangement\", or SSA, in America because BAE Inc is an arms length company with an all-American, security-cleared board. \"BAE Inc is very limited in what it can say [to executives] back home to the extent that they can ask for \u00a3100m without explaining what they need the money for,\" he said.</p> <p>In 2006 Mike Turner, BAE's former chief executive, explained that the firewall meant: \"The British members of the corporate leadership, me included, get to see the financial results; but many areas of technology, product and programme are not visible to us.</p> <p>\"The SSA effectively allows us to operate in the US as an American company, providing the highest levels of assurance and integrity in some of the most sensitive fields of national security provision.\"</p> <p>EADS on the other hand has struggled to make as much headway in the US defence market, and analysts say the Americans may downgrade BAE's SSA if it looks as if France may interfere. \"There is an element of Francophobia [in the US] and the fact is EADS is seen as fundamentally French.\"</p> <p>The US defence department has not yet shown its cards on the merger stating only that it needs more time to assess the security implications.</p> <p>Anderson said the US will have \"major concerns\" about national security and the risks of state secrets being leaked. \"If there's a deal, the US are going to go through it point by point to understand what [projects] are included in the deal, and to get it past lawmakers they will have to ring fence things and there will be forced sell-offs.\"</p> <p>He said a major problem with being able to understand the impact of the deal is the inability of anyone out side the companies to know exactly what they are working on because many \"black\" projects are so secret that only a few members of staff know about them.</p> <p>One of the latest black projects, a drone called Herti [High Endurance Rapid Technology Insertion] was developed in complete secrecy at BAE's Warton airfield in Lancashire.</p> <p>Secrecy at the Warton base, which was integral in the development of Nimrod and Typhoon and Tornado jets, is just as tight today. \"No one will speak to you,\" a BAE Systems spokesman said when the Guardian said it planned to visit the base this week. \"If you come and try and doorstep staff we will warn all staff not to speak to you.\"</p> <p>She was right.</p>",
  "<p>NFL players and fans have reacted with relief to an agreement ending the league's bitter dispute with referees that had disrupted the start of the season with a flood of embarrassing bad calls by hastily drafted in replacements.</p> <p>The NFL's regular referees had been locked out by the league after failing to reach an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement, especially over the issue of pension payments.</p> <p>Football is the nation's most popular sport and also one of the most lucrative, and there had been a fear that the ongoing bad calls could have damaged the sport's reputation and finances alike.</p> <p>\"Welcome back,\" said Tennessee Titans' backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck on his Twitter page. Even the White House got in on the action. Jay Carney, President Barack Obama's official spokesman, said: \"The president's very pleased that the two sides have come together. It is a great day for America.\"</p> <p>The fight disrupted the start of the 2012-2013 season with a series of gaffes by the inexperienced replacement referees that outraged fans, sports commentators and team managers, several of whom have recently had high-profile spats with officials.</p> <p>But the trouble really reached boiling point on Monday night when a game-winning last-second touchdown was wrongly awarded to the Seattle Seahawks as they battled with the Green Bay Packers.</p> <p>That call sparked widespread outrage and tabloid front pages that labelled it as one of the worst refereeing decisions in the sport's history. The New York Post newspaper even ran a cartoon showing the replacement referees as being blind, complete with guide dogs and canes.</p> <p>But in the wake of the furore the two sides have now settled on a new eight year deal that gives officials higher salaries and improved retirement benefits.<br>The regular officials will now return to the field beginning on Thursday night at a game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns, ahead of a vote on Saturday by the referees union that is expected to officially ratify the deal.</p> <p>In a joint statement with the NFL Referees Association, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the deal would bring stability back to the game. \"This agreement supports long-term reforms that will make officiating better. The teams, players and fans want and deserve both consistency and quality in officiating,\" Goodell said. \"Now it's time to put the focus back on the teams and players where it belongs.\"</p> <p>The move will begin the process of rebuilding the league's image. The replacement referees, drawn from the ranks of lower division college, high school and semi-professional football, were clearly no match for the regular, unionised, referees. Some of the bad calls they made led to open disputes with team managers. New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick was fined for making contact with a referee on Sunday, while Denver Broncos coach John Fox and the team's defensive coordinator, Jack Del Rio, were also fined for publicly criticising officials following a loss.</p> <p>The main bone of contention in the dispute had been pensions. The deal now assures current referees that their pension plans will continue, but new officials brought into the system will instead get a 401(k) retirement savings plan. That will allow the NFL to gradually wither away the pension scheme as current officials retire or otherwise leave the sport.</p>",
  "<p>Police investigating the deaths of a couple whose bodies were discovered in a fast-flowing river in north <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales\" title=\"\">Wales</a> say their deaths are being treated as an \"unfortunate tragic accident\".</p> <p>Witnesses had seen the man and woman, who were in their 20s, walking dogs by the river Clywedog in Wrexham, which was swollen following the torrential rain. But police were not able to verify reports they had been trying to rescue a dog from the water.</p> <p>The deaths came as thousands of people around the UK were affected by flooding in the worst September storms for 30 years, although forecasters said the worst of the rain was over.</p> <p>The body of the first victim, named locally as Alicia Williams, 27, was found on a sandbank in the river, at Erdigg, during the early evening. Her 25-year-old partner David Platt's body was discovered downstream seven hours later following an extensive search by about 20 police, firefighters and volunteers from mountain rescue.</p> <p>Residents said Platt worked at a local farm constructing children's playpens and the couple had recently had a baby daughter. Other locals described the river's levels in recent days as \"horrific\", saying it had risen 4ft (1.2m) since the heavy rainfall.</p> <p>North Wales police said there were no witnesses to say whether one or both had gone into the water to retrieve a dog, so it was impossible to speculate how they ended up there. Two bouquets had been left at the side of a gate.</p> <p>Michael Morgan, who works at a car wash close to the entrance to Erddig country park, said he was alerted by a whippet that licked his ear as he buffed a car. \"I thought it was a stray at first and was going to tie it up.\" But he realised the dog was in a beautiful condition, so went up to a field to have a look for the owner.</p> <p>He went into the park and saw three more dogs, two retrievers and a Jack Russell, sitting beside a Citro\u00ebn Picasso, which is thought to have belonged to the couple. The two retrievers were wet up to their heads. He saw the woman's body and said he recognised her as a dog walker in the area and it had been a terrible shock.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Mark Pierce of North Wales police said causes of death have yet to be established. Families of the couple were going through indescribable grief, he said. Pierce said the likely scenario is that \"there was unfortunately a tragic accident\".</p> <p>Elsewhere, homes, roads and the rail network in northern parts of England and Wales continue to be affected by flooding. In York, the River Ouse was stabilised, as towns and rivers in North Yorkshire were warned of the risk of flooding by the Environment Agency.</p> <p>There are still 36 flood warnings in place, chiefly in the north east of England where 27 such warnings continue, with seven in the north west, one in the Midlands and one in Wales. The number is expected to fall as the rain eases.</p> <p>The Environment Agency said about 570 homes and businesses had been flooded across England and Wales since Sunday, including 300 homes in Yorkshire. It warned communities in North Yorkshire to stay alert and prepare for the risk of flooding, as rivers peak at record levels. Emergency teams worked overnight on Wednesday to shore up river defences and pump out floodwater.</p> <p>The River Ouse reached its peak at more than 5m above normal levels on Thursday. Yorkshire Water said river water was overloading sewers and that its pumping stations were working to full capacity. Thousands of sandbags were delivered to the village of Cawood, Yorkshire, which was in danger of flooding.</p>",
  "<p>It says something about the state of the world when a country running a current account deficit of 5.4% is considered a global safe haven. Such though is the status of the UK, despite the fact that it was in the red as never before in the second quarter of 2012.</p> <p>Jim Leaviss of M&amp;G Investments notes that on previous occasions when Britain has been running a current account shortfall on anything approaching this scale, the upshot was a big fall in the value of the pound to bring exports into some sort of balance with imports. That was the case after the Barber boom of the early 1970s \u2013 when the current account deficit hit 4% of GDP \u2013 and in the early 1990s in the wake of the Lawson boom. A current account deficit of 3% of GDP in 2007 was followed by a 25% fall in the value of sterling.</p> <p>Explaining why the trade-weighted value of the pound has increased by 15% since its trough in early 2009 takes some doing. Is it because Britain is a global powerhouse? Hardly. The black hole in the current account reflects a deeply dysfunctional economy that produces too little and consumes too little. For some years after the turn of the millennium the cracks were papered over because the City's speculators were better (or perhaps luckier) than their counterparts overseas. That prop, according to the latest official data, has now been kicked away.</p> <p>Is it because the government has a credible strategy for reducing the UK's budget deficit? Again, that's a tough one to swallow. Two years in which the economy has gone sideways means the deficit is getting bigger not smaller and George Osborne looks odds-on to abandon one of his two fiscal rules when he gives his Autumn Statement in early December.</p> <p>That only leaves one possible reason for Britain's special status in the eyes of global investors: it is not part of the eurozone. Such has been the focus on Greece, Spain and Italy that few have noticed that the UK can't grow in the absence of rising house prices, has been living well beyond its means for the past three decades and now has a twin deficit problem the like of which it has never experienced in its peace time history. Some safe haven.</p>",
  "<p>Rwanda's biggest aid donor, the European Union, has partially frozen its financial support to the east African nation, dealing what may be the heaviest blow yet to president Paul Kagame.</p> <p>The move follows decisions by the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden to suspend donor support over allegations that the Rwandan military is supporting a murderous rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> <p>Britain's position has been more ambiguous: after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/27/uk-blocks-rwanda-aid\" title=\"\">initially freezing</a> \u00a316m of general budget support to the country in July, it unblocked half that amount earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/06/britain-resumes-aid-to-rwanda\" title=\"\">a partial U-turn</a> that provoked criticism. The EU's decision now leaves Britain isolated.</p> <p>Analysts said the EU had been \"dithering\" over the issue since a report was published by experts of the UN security council's sanctions committee alleging Rwandan support for the violent rebel group M23. <a href=\"http://www.gov.rw/RWANDA-S-RESPONSE-TO-THE-ALLEGATIONS-CONTAINED-IN-THE-ADDENDUM-TO-THE-UN-GROUP-OF-EXPERTS-INTERIM-REPORT\" title=\"\">Kigali vehemently denies the charges</a>.</p> <p>The EU said it would press on with existing aid projects aimed at Rwanda's poor, but direct budgetary support of up to \u20ac70m (\u00a356m) over six years has effectively been suspended. Overall EU aid to the country is \u20ac380m from 2008 to 2013.</p> <p>\"Some new decisions concerning additional budget support have been put on hold,\" an EU spokesperson said. \"In light of the current conflict in eastern DRC, the EU takes seriously the allegations contained in the report of the group of experts of the UN security council sanctions committee and needs more time to assess these allegations.</p> <p>\"Therefore, some new decisions concerning additional budget support have been delayed pending the clarification of Rwanda's role in the conflict and its constructive engagement in search of solutions.\"</p> <p>The M23 is led by Bosco Ntaganda, who is wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes It was formed when fighters from an ethnic Tutsi rebel group integrated into the Congolese military in a 2009 peace deal. The six-month uprising has forced 470,000 people to flee their homes.</p> <p>The Congolese government welcomed the EU's stand. Atoki Ileka, its ambassador to France and special envoy to the UN, said: \"This position gets into line with what many European countries have done so far. It's a step in the right direction. It is good to put pressure on the Rwandan leadership.\"</p> <p>Civilians are being killed and raped because of a \"so-called\" rebel movement, he added, and it was vital to find a solution. \"The stalemate is on the Rwandan side. The evidence is there. We all know Rwanda is directly supporting a rebellion in the region. There has been interference going on for 15 years and we must put a stop to it.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/11/dr-congo-m23-rebels-committing-war-crimes\" title=\"\">report by Human Rights Watch</a> earlier this month accused the M23 of widespread war crimes, including summary executions, rapes and forced recruitment. Thirty-three of those executed were young men and boys who tried to escape the rebels' ranks, the watchdog said, adding that it had clear evidence that the Rwandan army had deployed troops to directly support M23.</p> <p>Carina Tertsakian, senior researcher on Rwanda for Human Rights Watch, said: \"The EU is one of the biggest donors to Rwanda and this should send a clear signal that the Rwandan military should stop supporting the M23, otherwise Rwanda's relationship with international partners and friends may be jeopardised. Rwanda still depends heavily on foreign aid for its national budget to it should take this seriously.\"</p> <p>Britain's failure to hold the line was a mistake, Tertsakian added. \"In our view that was strategically counter-productive. It gave the signal that everything was fine. It was premature.\"</p> <p>When the controversial decision was made, Britain claimed that Rwanda deserved credit for engaging constructively in peace talks. \"Given this progress, and recognising that the government of Rwanda has continued to demonstrate its strong commitment to reducing poverty and improving its financial management, Britain will partially restore its general budget support to Rwanda,\" Andrew Mitchell, the outgoing international development secretary, told parliament.</p> <p>A source at the department for international development said on Thursday: \"The new secretary of state, Justine Greening, will be looking extremely closely at the issue of budget support to Rwanda.\"</p> <p>Last month Kagame, once seen as a darling of the west, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/25/paul-kagame-rwanda-us-britain\" title=\"\">castigated donors</a> who cut aid and launched a so-called \"dignity fund\" to help wean the country off its dependence on outside help. Rwanda relies on donors for about 40% of its budget.</p> <p>Its foreign minister, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LMushikiwabo\" title=\"\">Louise Mushikiwabo</a>, responded to the EU cuts on Twitter. \"EU suspending 'new aid' to Rwanda is either old news or designed to mislead,\" she posted. \"No such decision has been taken.\"</p> <p>Kagame and Congolese president Joseph Kabila are due to join a UN crisis meeting in New York on Thursday. On Monday Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, met both leaders to push for a solution, only for Kabila to make indirect reference to Rwanda's alleged meddling in his speech before the UN general assembly on Tuesday.</p> <p>Aid agencies warn that the situation on the ground is worsening and the UN's refugee agency has called for an additional $40m (\u00a325m) to help those displaced by fighting.</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res reported that its staff now fear for their safety. \"It's alarming that our Congolese colleagues are compelled to join the thousands of people currently displaced in the region,\" said Jan-Peter Stellema, MSF's operations manager. \"It's a strong indication of how fear has escalated, how people believe the situation will go from bad to worse. It also shows the increasing challenge to deliver medical aid to those in need.\"</p> <p>Franz Rauchenstein, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Congo, added: \"The security in the east of the country has deteriorated further. People in areas where there is a high level of violence are hit very hard. Because the situation is rapidly and steadily worsening, the ability of people to meet their needs is being severely tested.\"</p>",
  "<p>Too many businesses are sleepwalking towards extinction, without truly appreciating just how short their lives will be. Conventional business models and strategies, largely founded in the last century, offer limited value in the challenging world of today.</p> <p>Whichever way one looks, the assumptions of the past are being severely challenged. Business strategists can no longer rely on a world that has an endless supply of resources, cheap fossil fuels, a benign climate and limitless capacity to absorb waste, where consumer demand and economies grow forever, enabled by cheap credit. This landscape will never return.</p> <p>Yet these business critical factors still have little impact in many <a href=\"https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/How_companies_manage_sustainability_McKinsey_Global_Survey_results__2558\" title=\"\">boardroom discussions and investment decisions</a>, and many are <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/07/30/here-zero-can-we-grow-no-impact\" title=\"\">slow to take advantage</a> of the business opportunities offered by the green economy.</p> <p>But the strategic challenge for business is stark: adapt or die.</p> <p>Should oil companies stay in fossil fuels, or make a transition and become a renewable energy company?</p> <p>Should mining companies keep digging holes to exploit increasingly scarce materials, or make a transition and become a sustainable closed-loop resource company?</p> <p>Should construction companies remain engaged in the net depletion of resources, or move towards becoming a zero-adverse impact facilities business within the circular economy?</p> <p>Should financial services companies continue to sell products that absorb wealth from the real economy, or can they develop products and services that enable the affordable transition of customers towards a more sustainable future?</p> <h2>A new strategy</h2> <p>With this challenge real business strategy starts and the smart minds get moving applying real intellect to deliver radical solutions that enable businesses to survive and prosper. Becoming consciously aware, in order to make better-informed decisions, and deliver more resilient, lasting and profitable business models.</p> <p>Our intent is key; for truly sustainable business, we first of all have to want it to be so. Our business models and strategies must be built, or rebuilt, with sustainability principles at their very core. Without the right intent, the sustainability gap looms large.</p> <p>Fundamentally, strategies need to be configured towards sustainable consumption patterns. Without this, any business strategy within a resource and energy-constrained world becomes self-defeating. This also means helping and educating our customers to become more sustainable, too. Patagonia, the Californian clothing company, has been taking a lead here, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/patagonia-values-led-business-benefit-corp?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">encouraging its customers to buy less</a> and really pushing the re-use, repair and recycling business model.</p> <p>This leads on to an alignment with circular economy principles, where waste is designed out, and where customers are able to buy products that are more durable, more easily and economically repaired, upgraded or remanufactured. It's great to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/apr/26/marks-spencer-shwopping-scheme\" title=\"\">M&amp;S's \"shwopping\" scheme</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.sustainablebusinesslab.org/profiles/blogs/new-case-study-life-technologies\" title=\"\">Life Technologies</a> in the US, which is also doing interesting work on product-take-back. Thankfully, this stuff is not just for the big boys either; smaller companies such as <a href=\"http://www.wightsails.com/recycling-sails/\" title=\"\">Wightsails</a> have also seen the business opportunity, recycling old sails and converting them into a wide range of quality domestic products.</p> <p>Business models also need to become more holistic, transparent and accountable. The costs of key factors that were simply labelled as externalities now need to be considered more carefully. The costs associated with pollution, resource scarcity, climate change impacts, carbon and social costs all have an increasingly direct impact on profitability and therefore attractiveness to shareholders.</p> <p>But the converse is also true \u2013 deal with these factors in the right way, and it becomes very easy to take cost out, and increase sales: creating virtuous, rather than vicious, circles.</p> <h2>Greater resilience</h2> <p>This enlightened approach also enables greater resilience; our businesses will last for longer and keep delivering profitability. Dong Energy, for example, is making a transition away from fossil fuels, <a href=\"https://www.dongenergy.com/en/responsibility/approach/pages/from_our_ceo.aspx\" title=\"\">towards 85% renewables by 2040</a>. It can be done!</p> <p>But we also need to think through the higher purpose of each of our businesses \u2013 and what they are really here to do. As the late <a href=\"http://www.sustainablebusinesslab.org/profiles/blogs/ray-c-anderson-the-greatest-man-i-nearly-worked-with\" title=\"\">Ray Anderson</a>, founder and chairman of Interface Inc, said: \"business generates profit to exist; it exists to serve a higher purpose.\"</p> <p>It is also increasingly obvious, that business strategies need to focus on the long-term. While this can be a tough call for many in the current economic climate, sustainability-focused companies significantly outperform traditional firms in terms of stock market and accounting performance. Caf\u00e9 Direct has an <a href=\"http://www.cafedirect.co.uk/discover-our-difference/reinvestment/\" title=\"\">impressive strategic long-term investment perspective</a> \u2013 to ensure we will all have good coffee to drink in the years ahead, grown in a sustainable way, and with growers receiving a fair and sustainable reward for their efforts.</p> <p>This is potentially the most inspiring time in our history to be in business, and we need to mobilise our great minds and all our companies to do the right thing, and do it well. This is not a time for green-wash, or PR stunts. This is a time where the companies that will prosper will be the ones that recognise the opportunity, as well as the risks, and are most agile in overcoming the barriers, in transforming what they do and how they do it. The challenge is set \u2013 best we get on.</p> <p><em>Michael Townsend is the founder and CEO of Earthshine Solutions and is passionate about promoting the benefits of sustainable business.

  "<p>Knobbly carrots, wonky spuds, bent courgettes and discoloured cauliflowers will return to supermarket shelves after one of the worst growing seasons farmers have experienced in decades.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/18/uk-driest-march-59-years\" title=\"\">driest March in 59 years</a>, followed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/02/june-record-wettest-month\" title=\"\">wettest June</a> and autumn storms and flooding have reduced British fruit and vegetable harvests by more than 25% and left supermarkets unable to source their regular shaped, blemish-free produce.</p> <p>On Thursday, Sainsbury's relaxed its rules on the cosmetic appearance of fresh produce and allowed fruit and vegetables that would normally be ploughed back into fields to be sold in its 1,012 stores.</p> <p>\"We've taken the decision to radically change our approach to buying British fruit and vegetables as a result of this year's unseasonal weather. This may mean a bit more mud on peas or strawberries that are a little smaller than usual, but our customers understand and love the idea,\" said Judith Batchelar, director of Sainsbury's food.</p> <p>\"The unpredictable weather this season, has left growers with bumper crops of ugly-looking fruit and vegetables with reported increases in blemishes and scarring, as well as shortages due to later crops. We've committed to make use of all fruit and veg that meets regulation and stands up on taste, and hope customers will help us all make the most of the British crop in spite of its sometimes unusual appearance,\" she said.</p> <p>Other supermarkets, including Morrisons and Waitrose, have said they may also relax standards.</p> <p>The move by Sainsbury's has delighted food and poverty campaigners who have long argued that rejecting good food on aesthetic rather than on nutritional grounds is morally wrong and also increases prices. The UK <a href=\"http://www.soilassociation.org/\" title=\"\">Soil Association</a>, which sets standards for organic produce, has estimated that 20-40% of some UK fruit and vegetables are rejected because they are misshapen or discoloured even before they reach the shops.</p> <p>\"It's about time supermarkets woke up to the urgent need to reduce food waste by accepting perfectly good but irregular shaped fruit and vegetables. But they must not return to the bad old days when huge amounts of food was rejected because it didn't meet their cosmetic standards,\" said Friends of the Earth land campaigner Vicki Hird.</p> <p>Fruit and vegetables grown in the UK are governed by European Union food regulations but supermarkets require producers to meet higher cosmetic standards, which leads to perfectly edible food being \"graded out\".</p> <p>Frost, wind, rain and drought can discolour and blemish produce but there is no loss of nutrients. Instead, say campaigners, supermarket demand for cosmetic quality increases the cost of food as farmers have to get higher prices for their acceptable produce to make ends meet.</p> <p>Research last year by the government's waste reduction body, Wrap, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/15/food-waste-uk-homes\" title=\"\">showed that the recession has encouraged supermarkets and householders to throw out less food</a>. According to Wrap, British families rejected nearly 7.2m tonnes of food a year - a reduction of 13% or 1.1m tonnes since 2007.</p>",
  "<p>The fragile state of the US's economic recovery was thrown into focus once more Thursday as the government announced growth was slowing and orders for long-lasting goods plunged in August, the latest sign of a weakening manufacturing sector.</p> <p>US gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the broadest measure of the economy \u2013 grew at an annual rate of 1.3% between April and June, the commerce department said Thursday. The figure was revised down from a previously reported 1.7% gain.</p> <p>Meanwhile the commerce department said durable goods orders fell 13.2% last month, the largest fall since January 2009. The measure of orders for goods designed to last three months or more is a key indicator of economic growth. </p> <p>The decrease followed three consecutive monthly increases including a 3.3% rise in July. August's figure was a seasonally adjusted $198.49bn, the lowest dollar figure since February 2011, and far below most economists predictions.</p> <p>The collapse was driven in large part by by declining transportation orders, particularly for aircraft. Transportation equipment orders fell 34.9% following four consecutive monthly increases. Orders for civilian aircraft plunged. Boeing received 260 orders in July and just one in August. Australia's Qantas airline cancelled an $8.5bn order with Boeing in August, triggering a net decline in new orders for the month. Motor-vehicle and parts orders dropped 10.9%. Outside of transportation, August orders slid 1.6%.</p> <p>But not all the news was bad. Non-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched barometer of business spending plans, rose 1.1% after falling for the previous two months. The increase was above economists' expectations for 0.5% gain.</p> <p>Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics, said the aircraft figures had skewed the latest figures but they still showed the fundamental weakness of the US's recovery.</p> <p>\"It's not as nasty as it looks but it's still quite dire,\" he said. \"There is a downward trend, whether businesses are worried about the global outlook or US fiscal issues isn't clear but there is clearly some concern,\" he said.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said: \"Yes 1.3% growth is worse than 1.7% but the larger story is that growth in the second quarter was really bad.\" He said cuts in government spending were a major drag on the economy but it was also clear that consumers and businesses were also becoming more cautious.</p> <p>The figures came as the latest weekly number for people claiming unemployment insurance for the first time fell sharply. Some 359,000 people filed for jobless benefits for the first time in the week ending last Saturday, down 26,000 from the previous week, the labor department said.</p> <p>The number is close to the 350,000 economists see as a benchmark for recovery in the jobs market. The less volatile four-week average was 374,000, down 4,500 from the previous week. Next week the monthly nonfarm payroll report will give a wider snapshot of the US jobs market. The closely watched indicator has become a monthly flashpoint in the 2012 election.</p> <p>The latest economic figures present arguments for both sides with the presidential election just weeks away.</p> <p>In his latest TV ads President Barack Obama claims the economy is \"moving forward again\", after reminding viewers of the depth of the economic crisis the country faced when he took office.</p> <p>\"It's time for a new economic patriotism, rooted in the belief that growing our economy begins with a strong, thriving middle class,\" says Obama. \"Read my plan. Compare it to Governor Romney's and decide for yourself.\"</p> <p>Romney and his vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan have stepped up their attacks on the president. In an interview with 60 Minutes last Sunday Romney said a vote for Obama was a vote for continued economic woes and higher deficits.</p>",
  "<p>Red squirrels have been wiped out from a large swath of northern Italy, threatening a further biodiversity crisis for the species on a par with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/05/red-grey-squirrels-cornwall\" title=\"\">its near extinction in the British Isles</a>.</p> <p>There are now no red squirrels left in an area of more than 1,150 square kilometres (sq km) in Piedmont, according to research from the universities of Turin, Genoa and Varese. On the edge of this large region, the species is also under threat from the incursions of grey squirrels.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396793500\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348757006163/Grey-squirrel-spread-and--001.jpg\" alt=\"Grey squirrel spread and red squirrel extinction\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grey squirrel spread and red squirrel extinction in Piedmont</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the spread of the grey squirrel continues unchecked, the species could spread as far as France, the scientists fear. They are calling for more research and control and conservation measures aimed at preserving the remaining red squirrel populations and containing the spread of the greys.</p> <p>Grey squirrels were introduced into Italy relatively recently, in 1948. They were a gift from the US ambassador and kept in Turin, but escaped into the wild and rapidly colonised the surrounding area \u2013 despite warnings from the UK, where importing grey squirrels was forbidden from before the second world war, when the devastating effects of having imported greys in the 1880s had become clear.</p> <p>Grey squirrels are not only more aggressive than the native European red squirrel, which causes them to invade red-dominated areas and take over, but they also carry a deadly virus, the squirrel pox. While greys are largely immune to the virus, it is lethal to red squirrels, which typically die within one or two weeks of being infected.</p> <p>From only four animals in 1948, at Stupinigi near Turin, the greys spread rapidly in recent years. Until 1970 the distribution of greys was limited to the Stupinigi woods, occupying an area of about 12 sq km. By 1990 this area had expanded to more than 200 sq km, stretching mainly southwards into the Cuneo province.</p> <p>By 2000, grey squirrels occupied 900 sq km and this year, fresh research from the three universities shows that their distribution now extends to more than 2,000 sq km. In more than half of that area, the native reds have been entirely wiped out, and in the remainder they are under severe threat.</p>",
  "<p>What does it take to get you out of bed in the morning when your in tray is piled sky high with the woes of the planet?</p> <p>Guardian Sustainable Business chairman Jo Confino did his best to get up close and personal with the panel at last week's quarterly debate on the challenges of staying positive in the face of adversity.</p> <h2>Fish stocks and the health of the oceans</h2> <p>Peter Hajipieris, director of sustainable and external affairs at frozen food giant Birds Eye Iglo, was bursting with positivity. This despite the fact that 30% of his company's business is frozen fish, and scientists have warned that the world's fish stocks are rapidly depleting.</p> <p>Confino asked him: \"With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/cod-pass-notes-3248?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">only 120 'old' cod in the North Sea</a>, what's it like to work in an industry where the global situation is so dire? When you look at what your company does and what you personally do against the challenge, do you ever go home and think, 'in 20 years there may not be a fish business'?\"</p> <p>Hajipieris, however, is a man who sees the oceans as half full rather than half empty. The Pacific Ocean alone is 64m square miles, he points out \u2013 a vast expanse that together with the other oceans covers three quarters of the planet. \"We have to make the sea work,\" he says.</p> <p>But the key to staying focused and positive, he says, is to surround yourself with like-minded companies. \"We really believe in collaboration, including with our competitors. The challenges are much bigger than any one company or country. We get that. You have to choose your battles and decide where you can make a difference. We focus on the continuity of food supply.\"</p> <p>Confino persisted: \"But on a personal side, how do you manage yourself when you clearly see what's happening in the world? Do you ever switch from being hopeful to being pessimistic?\"</p> <p>No, Hajipieris said. \"I genuinely believe that the planet and humans have of way of balancing themselves, but the time scale is longer than we are used to ... I'm an eternal optimist. I don't give up. And if I did, we wouldn't have a food supply, and our consumers depend on that.\"</p> <p>However, there were moments of frustration, especially when the company's efforts were misreported in the media, he added.</p> <h2>How to influence other companies</h2> <p>Edward Butt, vice-president of sustainability at Tate &amp; Lyle, was somewhat more introspective. \"The sustainability professional needs a certain skill set,\" he said. \"One has to be able to influence people when you may not have direct control or seniority over them. You have to work through the company, try to align your sustainability objectives with their objectives, such as increasing sales in a sustainable part of the business.\"</p> <p>\"But do you ever feel that you are pushing a rock up a hill?\" Confino asked. \"That people are stuck in an old way of doing things?\"</p> <p>Butt said it was easier to push a sustainability message when you are selling to other businesses instead of consumers. He pointed out that Tate &amp; Lyle now supplies the food industry \u2013 having sold its sugar and golden syrup brands two years ago.</p> <p>\"Most consumers don't buy green. It's the same thing with socially responsible investment. It's a niche market. But if you are supplying the likes of Tesco and Walmart, they get sustainability. If they don't have sustainability of supply, in 25 years, they won't be here. It makes it an easier job.\"</p> <p>He said big businesses' awareness of sustainability had increased dramatically over the past 10 to 15 years. \"It could be argued that business is now giving more leadership than government.\"</p> <h2>Focusing on achievements</h2> <p>John Revess, director of sustainability for packaging company Rexam, said the strides made in sustainability over the past 20 years, with lighter materials and a tripling of recycling rates, helped motivate him.</p> <p>\"We face challenges, and internally it's never easy, but we are all catalysts for change. Business as usual is not what we do. For me looking back over time and seeing we are making progress makes me feel good.\"</p> <p>Confino asked whether the same pace of change could be kept up, or whether the \"low-hanging fruit\" had already been picked.</p> <p>Revess said he had faith in human ingenuity. \"There will be new materials, new ways of using those materials, and new supply chains that will allow us to deliver sustainability targets. Continuous improvement never finishes.\"</p> <p>But would it be enough to meet the scale of the challenge, Confino persisted, citing rising sea levels and the catastrophic impacts of climate change forecast to be around the corner. Was wholesale change of the system now required to avert disaster?</p> <p>Revess quoted the Serenity Prayer: \"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference\", saying he could not do anything to stop the melting of the ice cap. \"I accept that. My job is to deliver within my sphere of influence of the packaging we produce, deliver food to consumers with less impact on the planet.\"</p> <p>Butt agreed: \"For me, sustainability is a journey. You can't manage everything every day but you can chop it up into pieces and work on those pieces. If you are motivated by an environmental ethic, as I am, there will be ups and downs, but it's about challenging yourself and your colleagues to keep going and take one step at a time.\"</p> <h2>Speak to people in their own language</h2> <p>Ian Hill, chief sustainability officer at BT's broadband supplier, Openreach, said sustainability professionals could have an impact if they used the right language for their audience and spoke to people on their own terms. It was important not to focus too much on the word \"sustainability\" itself, he said.</p> <p>\"What matters to people [in the company] is their own safety and the fact that they are connecting communities.\" Similarly, customers want services. \"The fact that we are doing something that lowers their carbon footprint is welcome, but not a focus.\"</p> <p>There was a suggestion from the audience that the views of young people, who would be most affected by the changes of the planet, should be taken on board to shake companies out of complacency.</p> <p>Revess said: \"Young people may be angry but they aren't doing very much about it when it comes to building a recycling society. It's the middle-aged people who are making sure they recycle things at home.\"</p> <h2>Time to take risks</h2> <p>To wind up, Confino asked what risk the panellists would be prepared to take to bring about a step-change at their companies.</p> <p>Hajipieris said he would take most of the marketing budget and spend it on advertising its sustainability efforts. Hill suggesting putting more of the operational budget into research. Revess wanted to set more visionary targets that would require a leap in innovation to achieve, such as those set by Unilever or Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Butt said: \"I think the best idea came from the floor today. I'd have some young people come into some board meetings and see what happens.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Last year, Muse frontman Matt Bellamy announced the band's sixth album would be a \"Christian gangsta-rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face-melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia\". It tells you something about Muse that it was hard to work out exactly how far his tongue was lodged in his cheek. For one thing, it's almost always difficult to work out how far Bellamy's tongue is lodged in his cheek, as when he told NME he believed in the theories of <a href=\"http://www.sitchin.com/\" title=\"\">Zecharia Sitchin</a>, whose big idea was that the human race had been genetically engineered by aliens from the planet Nibiru, or cancelled a series of US interviews on the grounds that he'd heard an asteroid was about to hit America. For another, if any currently extant major band were to be engaged in creating a Christian gangsta-rap jazz odyssey, with some ambient rebellious dubstep and face-melting metal flamenco cowboy psychedelia, it would probably be Muse. Comparisons are regularly made between their oeuvre and that of Queen, Rush and Radiohead: there's an argument that Muse are to pre-Kid A Radiohead what Meat Loaf circa Bat Out of Hell was to Bruce Springsteen. But none of them really capture the sheer level of trenchant preposterousness at which Muse operate. The most apposite comparison might be to say Muse have actually achieved what the Darkness set out to do: conquer the world with music that's clearly meant to be funny, but isn't supposed to be a joke.</p> <p>Indeed, it could be suggested that the only real giveaways to Bellamy's comic intent were that his bandmates were talking up their forthcoming album as a major sonic reboot \u2013 \"It's time to move on and do something radically different,\" suggested bassist Chris Wolstenholme \u2013 and that his description didn't actually sound that far removed from what Muse had done previously: they'd already achieved something best described as \"metal flamenco\" on 2006's Black Holes and Revelations. That said, anyone listening to Supremacy, the opening track of The 2nd Law, might wonder precisely how radical a reinvention Muse have undergone.</p> <p>The understated single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek0SgwWmF9w\" title=\"\">Madness</a> suggested a new stripped-back approach: there's not much to it beyond an electronic bassline, a decent pop song and Bellamy's vocal, which declines to unexpectedly burst into an ear-splitting falsetto (or scream), or proclaim the imminent arrival of the apocalypse, or indeed do any of the things he usually does within seconds of getting near a microphone. But clearly any discussions about toning it down a bit were shortlived. Supremacy's musical DNA is equal parts Led Zeppelin's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW_WLxseq0o\" title=\"\">Kashmir</a> and Wings' <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR46gQLyxuE\" title=\"\">Live and Let Die</a>: its idea of restraint is to leave it a minute and a&#xa0;half before bringing the choir in. It should be noted that, Madness aside, The 2nd Law's lowest-key track is Animals, which concludes with what sounds like a recording of a riot in full swing.</p> <p>In fact, the most obvious sign of change on The 2nd Law is its incorporation of the kind of dubstep produced by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJVmu6yttiw\" title=\"\">Skrillex</a> and dismissed by its detractors as \"brostep\". It actually meshes with Muse's existing style remarkably well, perhaps because Muse and your average brostep producer are cut from the same cloth in at least one sense: neither of them has much interest in subtlety. Unsubtle or not, the concluding two-part title track \u2013 the most obviously brostep-indebted thing here \u2013 is thunderously exciting stuff, a boiling mass of fidgety strings, electronic voices and sub-bass&#xa0;wobble.</p> <p>This is obviously all great rollicking fun, but there are problems with The 2nd Law. You can see why the organisers thought Muse would be the right band to provide the official song of London 2012, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt__jKWoYH8\" title=\"\">Survival</a> didn't work \u2013 partly because it seems to have no tune whatsoever, but mostly because it didn't fit the event. The Olympics turned out to be as much about tiny human stories \u2013 from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1tduGQPJJw\" title=\"\">Chad le Clos's dad</a> to Kirani James and Oscar Pistorius swapping nametags \u2013 as epic spectacle. With their choirs, string-laden intro, hysterical vocals and lyrics you might characterise as a bit Ayn Randy \u2013 \"I chose to survive whatever it takes \u2026 vengeance is mine \u2026 Fight! Win!\" \u2013 Muse got the scale but missed the humanity. Six albums in, this is a recurring problem: amusing and enjoyable as the aural histrionics are, you do start to wonder what, if anything, they're trying to express, or if it's just bombast for bombast's sake.</p> <p>Occasionally, you get the sense the band's sound is actually antithetical to genuine emotional impact. Follow Me is a song about Bellamy's baby son: \"I&#xa0;will keep you safe, I will protect you, I won't let them harm you,\" he sings. He obviously means it, but delivered as it is, in a portentous voice that leaves teeth-marks on the scenery, to a backdrop of distorted dive-bombing bass (courtesy of co-producers Nero) and florid synthesiser arpeggios, it sounds like he doesn't. Similarly, it's hard to tell whether there's actual political conviction behind the title track's equation of the second law of thermodynamics with global economic collapse, or if it's just showy grandiloquence, a lyrical counterpart to one of Bellamy's more baroque guitar solos.</p> <p>None of this stops The 2nd Law from being a hugely entertaining album. Nor will it stop it being a vast success. After all, no one goes to see a blockbuster for its profundity and deep characterisation. They go for the stunts and the special effects, both of which The 2nd Law delivers.</p>",
  "<p>I have just rattled off a stiffly-worded email of complaint, for it has just dawned on me that it is now over a month since my lawnmower went in for repairs at the local garden machinery workshop. </p> <p>I have started converting a number of areas of lawn in my garden to flower-rich meadows, and my mower simply isn't designed for such work. I have let the meadow plants grow, flower and seed, and the resulting foot-high herbage is overpowering my machine. Wild flower meadow creation is not proving to be the walk in the park as described by the magazines.</p> <p>Problems aside, the developing grasslands have given me a great deal of pleasure. In an earlier posting I have mentioned the flourishing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/26/bee-orchid-lawns\">bee orchids</a> that occur naturally in the lawns here, but more exciting still has been the appearance of a single flowering <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/wild_plants/plant_species/early_purple_orchid/\">early purple orchid</a> in a spot in which I scattered seed roughly four years ago. Another native beauty present is the greater burnet saxifrage (<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimpinella_major\">Pimpinella major</a></em>), something of a local speciality here to the east of Plymouth, and notable for its airy stems of queen anne's lace flowers that are so flawlessly white they gleam in the dark. And, of course, these flowers have attracted a wealth of insects: brown and blue butterflies in abundance, and bees galore.</p> <p>But one thing has outshone everything else, and that has been the yellow rattle (<em>Rhinanthus minor</em>). I love this plant for its strongly architectural structure and its burnished golden flowers, which look like tiny turtles hatching from their eggs. The plant has a more practical use, too, for it is a \"hemi-parasite\" - a partial parasite - and can be used to reduce the vigour of meadow grasses. Sure, it produces green leaves that photosynthesize, generating energy for plant growth from the sun's ray, but the rattle is happiest when its roots lock onto those of the grasses and suck the life out of them. Even out of flower, areas of meadow heavily invaded by this species support only the most meagre growth of grass: little wonder yellow rattle is loathed by farmers. </p> <p>It is loved, however, by those keen to establish a meadow grassland rich in flowers. It's important to reduce competition from coarse growing perennials, grasses included. This can be done by stripping nutrients from the soil \u2013 for example, by scraping off the overlying topsoil to reveal the poorer subsoil beneath \u2013 but yellow rattle achieves much the same results at considerably less cost and effort, and has become a mainstay within wild flower seed mixtures. </p> <p>If you want to introduce this species into your lawn, it's worth understanding the plant's ecology in the wild. It is an annual species that germinates in spring (typically March), flowers at the height of summer, and is in full seed a couple of months later (say, late August). As a strictly upright plant it cannot tolerate being cut or grazed off too severely during this period, so is most at home in old-fashioned hay meadows, where grazing is excluded during the summer months, and a late hay cut allows a good proportion of flowers to have successfully set seed. </p> <p>First cut your area of grass - think more of shaving a head to control nits, rather than a short back and sides \u2013 and collect and dispose of the clippings elsewhere. Sprinkle seeds very thinly over the scuffed turf: even a seed or two per metre is ample, for if the introduction is successful, the resulting plants will shower the ground with an abundance of fresh <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagule\">propagules</a> within the year. The seed is apparently short-lived, so sow it fresh in the late summer or autumn, and no later. You can cut as short and as often as you like through the winter and into spring, but by March, stop cutting, or at least raise the mower blades, for the seed should be germinating by then. You can probably get away with a final cut into early summer if you set the mower blades at their highest setting, for the youngsters will simply be encouraged to form a strong bushy plant if decapitated in their first month of growth. </p> <p>However, by mid May all mowing should cease, to allow the rattles to flower and seed. You'll know that the plant is mature and shedding ripe seed when the fruits take on a ghostly silvery-grey colour, and rattle when shaken: at this stage it looks rather like a poor man's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunaria_annua\">honesty</a>. </p> <p>Don't be too hasty to cut and remove the rattle-rich hay for the fruit ripens over a period of weeks, but when most of the seed heads have turned grey, it is a good time to pull up bunches of the plants, and to shake them over new lawn to encourage the large disc-shaped seeds to fall. With the last seed successfully shed, it's time to start that heavy mowing again. Which is, of course, why my mower is now struggling! Next year, I am going do my big end-of-year cut with a strimmer, and then rake and collect the cuttings by hand, before bringing out the mower.</p> <p>Yellow rattle seed is widely available to buy, but do check with the supplier that the seed is of local provenance. Six loosely defined subspecies of yellow rattle occur across Britain, reflecting differing geologies and habitats, so it would be tragic if we upset this balance through the introduction of non-native stock from the continent. Better still, you won't do any harm by taking just the smallest handful of seed from a natural population growing in a meadow close to your home, and use this to start your garden colony. Do make sure that you are removing only the tiniest proportion of seed from the wild colony, and check that the landowner is happy. </p> <p><em>Andy Byfield is one of the founders of the wild plant charity <a href=\"http://www.plantlife.org.uk/\">Plantlife</a>.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 July to correct the image credit.

It was driven by 21-year-old Nick Ponting, who started racing go-karts at the age of 12, and first broke the record by hitting 148mph earlier today at Elvington airfield in North Yorkshire.</p> <p>The previous record, of 137mph, was set by the grandson of racing legend Sir Malcolm Campbell, Don Wales, driving a Bluebird Electric in 2000. Wales attempted to break his own record in August 2011 but <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-14522963\" title=\"\">failed after the car hit a pothole on a beach in Wales</a>.</p> <p>Dale Vince, the founder of Ecotricity, said the company had built the Nemesis to \"stimulate thought and debate about how we'll be getting around when the world runs out of oil. And what we've been able to demonstrate is that wind-powered cars are not just feasible, but can be a load of fun.\"</p> <p>\"We made a number of modifications to the road-legal specification of the car to give it more down-force at higher-speed.\"</p> <p>Hypothetically, the car should be able to achieve 200mph, but real-world conditions reduce that considerably.

  "<p>Jeremy Clarkson's success was in danger of becoming embarrassing for the BBC. Arguably it already has as the BBC won't say how much it has paid to buy out the Top Gear motormouth from his share of the profits of Top Gear's commercial activities.</p> <p>But given that the business generated \u00a315m in pre-tax profits in the last year for which full figures are available, at a first glance it might be speculated that a 30% share could be worth as much as \u00a310m, or even \u00a315m. However, on Twitter, Clarkson chose to describe these maths as \"seriously wrong\" and the word is that it would be fairer to talk about a lower seven-figure number.</p> <p>No wonder, then, the BBC is reluctant to spell out the exact deal it has struck to remove Clarkson from their Top Gear joint venture. But it is extraordinary how fast Top Gear has become such a lucrative, global property \u2013 in which a fortune has been handed to Clarkson even though the programme existed long before its most famous presenter arrived.</p> <p>It was in 2008, to keep Clarkson on board, that corporation executives agreed to share with him 30% of a company designed to exploit Top Gear commercially. Fellow Repton school alumnus, and Top Gear's producer, Andy Wilman, got 20% \u2013 with the BBC putting in \u00a3100 to own the rest.</p> <p>That will have seemed like a good idea at the time, saving the BBC from paying Clarkson perhaps another \u00a31m a year in presenter's fees out of the BBC licence fee. Except, Top Gear turned out to be wildly lucrative, rapidly becoming one of the BBC's most successful brands, alongside Strictly and Doctor Who.</p> <p>Top Gear spread globally with ease \u2013 last year Top Gears launched in China and South Korea, joining the likes of the USA (where it can be seen on the History Channel). The magazine is published in 31 countries. Even Top Gear Stunt School, a \u00a31.99 iPhone, iPad app has been downloaded at least 2.4m times.</p> <p>The accounts demonstrate how rapid progress was. Top Gear Ltd (actually the company is called Bedder 6, but it amounts to the same thing) generated a modest pre-tax profit of \u00a32.9m in 2008/9 the first full year of trading under the new Clarkson-BBC joint venture. Just two years later, in the year to March 2011, the last full set of accounts available, profits had soared fivefold to \u00a315.2m.</p> <p>And the fast-moving money machine enriched Clarkson too. He pocketed rapidly increasing dividends: although Bedder 6 has not released its own accounts for 2011/12 \u2013 it is known it paid Clarkson a \u00a32.7m dividend that year, taking his overall BBC pay package to easily more than \u00a33m.</p> <p>In an era when the BBC is trying to cut pay deals, forcing the likes of Graham Norton to take less \u2013 Clarkson had obtained a pay rise of about \u00a3900,000. Even if most of Clarkson's cash didn't come direct from the BBC licence fee \u2013 the ultimate basis of his fortune was still an old BBC brand.</p> <p>And with his swelling income, Clarkson won the uncomfortable status of being the BBC's highest paid star, which as Jonathan Ross will testify brings a certain amount of scrutiny. That said, having sold out, Clarkson won't be complaining: it is the BBC that has been landed with the bombshell of a substantial payout.</p> <p>Except, because it is commercially confidential, us licence fee payers are not being told how much.</p>",
  "<p>Western and African political leaders have issued a forceful call for a military intervention in Mali, a country struggling with severe food shortages, drought and conflict. Meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations general assembly in New York on Wednesday, several leaders stressed that parts of Mali under rebel control following a coup earlier this year are serving as a haven for terrorists and must be brought under control. Aid officials warn, however, that an armed intervention in Mali could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in the region, which has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/audio/2012/jul/18/global-development-podcast-hunger-sahel\" title=\"\">experiencing a food and nutrition crisis</a> for nearly a year.</p> <p>\"Any intensification of conflict could make it even more difficult for communities to access the aid they need,\" said Mamadou Biteye, Oxfam's west Africa regional director. \"There is a major risk that military operations in northern Mali would make an already fragile humanitarian situation much worse.\"</p> <p>Since late last year, humanitarian officials <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/dec/07/sahel-facing-major-food-crisis\" title=\"\">have been warning of food shortages</a> in the Sahel, a region of Africa that stretches from Senegal and Mauritania along the Atlantic coast through to Chad and Sudan further east. The situation has been caused largely by erratic rainfall and drought.</p> <p>This is the third hunger crisis to hit the region in less than 10 years. Officials say more than 18 million people are experiencing hunger, including more than 1 million children. Mali, Mauritania, and Chad are the countries hardest hit.</p> <p>Erratic rainfall during the growing season made for a bad start last year. But the situation grew much more complicated in March, when members of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/23/mali-coup-draws-condemnation-ecowas\" title=\"\">military staged a coup in Bamako</a>, the capital of Mali. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/mali-president-traore-medical-tests\" title=\"\">Dioncounda Traor\u00e9, the country's president, went into hiding</a> and widespread disorder ensued. Within two weeks, Tuareg rebels had taken over large swathes of Mali's north, including the city of Timbuktu.</p> <p>Since then, more than 260,000 refugees have fled northern Mali, UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon told Wednesday's meeting, which was attended by the president of the World Bank and more than 50 heads of state.</p> <p>Mali's political insecurity has drawn the attention of major western powers, largely due to the presence of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). The group, which is widely considered a terrorist organisation, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/al-qaida-maghreb-sahel-new-somalia\" title=\"\">a significant presence in the Sahel</a>, and in Mali in particular. Analysts say AQIM may be taking advantage of the instability and setting up a stronghold in the rebel-controlled north.</p> <p>\"When a territory as large as France is being occupied by terrorist groups \u2026 you have a threat which concerns the world as a whole,\" Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, told the meeting. He called for the UN security council to adopt a new resolution authorising the deployment of a west African military force in Mali.</p> <p>US secretary of state Hillary Clinton applauded Hollande's strong words, adding: \"Now, with a larger safe haven and increased freedom to manoeuvre, terrorists are seeking to extend their reach and their networks in multiple directions.&#xa0;This is not only a humanitarian crisis; it is a powder keg that the international community cannot afford to ignore.\"</p> <p>Yayi Boni, the president of Benin, was equally emphatic. \"Nothing can be done in the Sahel without the restoration of the full territorial integrity of Mali,\" he said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union made a joint request for the UN to support a regional military force in Mali. In response, the security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2012/sc10698.doc.htm\" title=\"\">issued a resolution</a> in July that condemned the March coup and called for a \"roadmap\" for the restoration of state authority throughout the country.</p> <p>Humanitarian groups are uneasy about military intervention.</p> <p>\"Further fighting risks increasing humanitarian needs and forcing even more people to leave their homes,\" said Biteye. \"If such an operation is launched, all necessary steps must be taken to prevent civilian casualties and ensure respect for international humanitarian and human rights law.\"</p> <p>Ban assured the meeting that any further steps the UN takes in Mali would be \"considered extremely carefully\". And he acknowledged that military intervention could hinder humanitarian action in the region. \"There are no easy answers,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>More people are living in cities than ever before. Urban growth is transforming the face of our planet. But with this growth comes tensions over space and resources.</p> <p>In this month's Global development podcast, <strong>John Vidal</strong> hears from developers, slum-dwellers and the UN's settlement's agency, UN-Habitat, about the challenges of urbanisation, and how they can be addressed.</p> <p>What measures can be adopted to ensure cities are able to cope with changing populations and the effects of climate change? Is there one golden solution to planning a city so that it works well? And how can we learn from the mistakes of the past to design the cities of the future, where we'll increasingly live?</p> <p>We focus on Nairobi, in Kenya, home to more than 3 million people and one of the fastest growing capital cities in Africa, to think through some of these questions.</p>",
  "<p>The treasurer of the <a href=\"http://www.acf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Association of Charity Foundations </a>has questioned whether charities are right to keep much of their capital in reserve, or whether they should spent it more quickly it in ways that help beneficiaries.</p> <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.cfg.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Charity Finance Group</a>'s Investment conference, James Brooke Turner - who is also finance director at the<a href=\"http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/\" title=\"\"> Nuffield Foundation</a> - said: \"Do charities need such large reserves? If so, why? Some seem to anticipate catastrophe and keep much of their cash in reserve rather than doing good things with it.</p> <p>\"You don't have to eke out money forever, unless your charity specifically states that it needs to be around for perpetuity. You can be adventurous with money if it's in the best interests of beneficiaries. Remember you are there to please them, not donors.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"It seems to either be 'in perpetuity or bust' for many, when there are a whole load of things in between. Wouldn't it be nice to do something creative over next 20 years with the money?\"</p> <p>In the 'Whose money is it anyhow?' session, Turner said: \"Rather than deciding to spend three, four or five percent of your reserves, the question should be \u2013 what do we need to keep? And: could do something really useful with this?</p> <p>\"At Nuffield we do not want to accidentally accumulate money, we don't see the benefit in storing money...we set budgets to try to get rid of the stuff. \"</p> <p>The \u00a3230m endowment also has investments in short term government yields, private equities and global equities \u2013 particularly venture capital, he said. The speaker said he believed charities should be wary of advisors who tell them how to deal with their money, because he believes they're often talking in their own best interests. \"Sometimes trustees know better than advisors,\" he claimed.</p> <p>Turner said he felt that charities are often wrongly treated or act like pension funds. \"We are told all the time how to invest as if we're a pension fund. But charities are different and so should our approaches be.\"There's a completely different risk profile. Pension funds have to demonstrate they have a certain amount of funds every three years; charities don't need to do that.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/heathrow-third-runway-public-split?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">possibility of a third runway at Heathrow airport</a> is back in the headlines. Another runway would mean more flights, and more importantly more carbon emissions. It remains a controversial proposal, but the debate has been about where \u2013 rather than whether \u2013<em> </em>UK airport capacity should be increased.</p> <p>Discussion of the link between a new runway at Heathrow and the impact of aviation on climate change has been notable by its absence. This is frustrating and concerning, but not surprising: flying has for a long time existed in its own bubble in terms of behaviour change. It is simply not reasonable, argue policy makers, to expect people to fly less. But do the people agree?</p> <p>Figures from the most recent edition of the regular <a href=\"http://bsa-29.natcen.ac.uk/read-the-report/transport/introduction.aspx\" title=\"\">British Social Attitudes</a> survey do not paint quite such a simplistic picture. Although a majority of people (61%) felt that they should be allowed to travel by plane as much as they liked, the number dropped drastically when the caveat \"even if this harms the environment\" was included. In response to this modified question, only 18% agreed that flying should be unrestricted.</p> <p>These findings suggest two things. Firstly, that the link between aviation and climate change is not well understood by the general public (if it were, responses to the two questions would be broadly the same). And secondly, that many people are (in principle) in favour of some restrictions on flying.</p> <p>However, the relationship between people's views on climate change and their flying behaviour is more complex than this. <a href=\"http://www.brass.cf.ac.uk/projects/Sustainable_Lifestyles_and_Communities/sustainable-lifestyles--Climate-Change-and-the-Future-of-Brands.html\" title=\"\">Previous studies</a> have shown that the people who claim to be most concerned about climate change are often the ones who fly the most. And in the British Social Attitudes survey, respondents who said they were very concerned about climate change reported flying more in the past 12 months than those who said they were not at all concerned.</p> <p>Air travel doesn't correlate in a straightforward way with environmental awareness \u2013 but it does with affluence. Historically, aeroplanes were the preserve of the very wealthy \u2013 and when you look at the global picture, this is emphatically still the case. Only a tiny minority of the world's citizens regularly fly, and these are concentrated in wealthy nations.</p> <p>Even in the UK, it is the wealthy who fly the most. The well-off professional classes, who are more likely to express concern about climate change than people in poorer socio-economic groups, are accustomed to a lifestyle that requires regular flying, and don't seem to be in a hurry to change. So is there no hope of convincing those who claim to care about climate change to start leading by example, and reducing the amount they fly?</p> <p>Its worth reflecting on the fact that only very recently \u2013 in the past 30 years, or less \u2013 have the majority of British citizens been able to access cheap flights. The British Social Attitudes survey found that younger people were more likely to express a willingness to tackle climate change by reducing the amount they flew (although even among this group, the figure was still only 34%). So it is not inconceivable that public opinion about flying might shift again \u2013 driven by an increasingly climate-savvy younger generation.</p> <p>But it is perhaps organisations and business \u2013 more than individuals \u2013 that could really start to shift the social norms on flying. Through policies that reward employees for low-carbon travel, or give additional time (and flexibility) for workers who take the train to Europe, employers could create the space for good intentions to be translated into meaningful action.</p> <p>We have very quickly become used to a pace of life \u2013 and a style of doing business \u2013 that is predicated on an illusion: that we can rapidly reach far-away places without adversely affecting our natural environment. As the Heathrow debate grows louder again, we should be asking how we can reduce the need for more airport capacity, not just pondering where we should put the new runway.</p> <p><em>Adam Corner is a research associate at </em><a href=\"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Cardiff University</em></a><em> and policy advisor to the </em><a href=\"http://coinet.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Climate Outreach and Information Network</em></a><em>.

  "<p>If you go down to the shops today you'd better be ready to haggle, according to a survey by the MoneySavingExpert website, which found that many of the biggest retailers are giving discounts to more than half of people who ask for them.</p> <p>In a survey of 2,500 people it found electrical retailers and DIY stores were routinely agreeing to knock down prices, and even supermarket giants Tesco and Asda had been persuaded to offer money off.</p> <p>Comet topped the list as the best place to haggle, with 78% of those who had tried saying they had been successful, closely followed by B&amp;Q and Currys/PC World. </p> <p>Only stores where at least 100 people tried to get some sort of discount are included in the overall findings.</p> <p>MoneySavingExpert's founder, Martin Lewis, said he thought the large proportion of DIY stores on the list was because \"the closer it feels to a trade environment, the more likely it is that people will haggle\", while the presence of supermarkets was a a result of them selling big ticket items like electrical goods and furniture.</p> <p>\"Usually, big ticket items are the easiest things to haggle on: furniture, electricals, cars and digital equipment,\" he said. \"People need to adopt a don't ask, don't get attitude.

  "<p>The sustainability governance structure at Guardian News and Media (GNM) has undergone significant change over the past year to adapt to the company's changing commercial and editorial strategies.</p> <p>Carolyn Gray, group director HR, pensions and sustainability, has taken over responsibility for delivering the sustainability strategy for GNM and board champion role.</p> <p>Previously, this role was led by operations director Derek Gannon, who has now left the company.</p> <p>Carolyn Gray's role is to lead on sustainability policy and strategy across Guardian Media Group (GMG) and GNM. She will ensure that all of our businesses adhere to our published objectives. This includes meeting regularly with GMG sustainability representatives to exchange best practice and debate new ideas. </p> <p>To ensure that sustainability is embedded across the company, a senior leadership group (SLG) of directors had been meeting on a quarterly basis to identify opportunities and help overcome challenges.</p> <p>Due to major changes in the board structure, it was decided to integrate the SLG into regular board meetings. As a result, sustainability reporting is now done directly to the board on a quarterly basis, with monthly updates on key activities.</p> <p>Paula Tsung continues in her role as head of workplace and sustainability for GNM, reporting to Carolyn Gray, and is supported by a team of three: Christopher Hodgson, environment and sustainability manager, Fiona McKellar, community co-ordinator, and Jan Stevens, sustainability administrator. </p> <p>Jo Confino, executive editor of the Guardian and chairman of Guardian Sustainable Business, continues in his role of head of sustainability within all editorial departments as well as being sustainability adviser to GMG.</p> <p>To ensure that our entire organisation helps to realise our sustainability ambitions, each section of the business develops annual objectives that are then monitored and reported on, on a quarterly basis.</p> <p>A network of departmental advocates exists to promote sustainability, ensure a strong flow of information through the organisation and help us to achieve our objectives. They meet together on a quarterly basis with the sustainability team. </p> <p>All directors also have sustainability objectives. It has been our intention for some time to link the implementation of our sustainability strategy to directors' bonuses and, for the current financial year, each director will have one key sustainability objective. This will form part of the board's assessment of their performance.</p> <p>A sustainability strategy is has been developed to take the company through to 2015. It is based on six priorities: doing good business, improving digital sustainability, enhancing audience engagement, empowering people and community, low-impact operations and responsible procurement.</p> <p>Governance is not just about policies but also about process, and GNM has worked hard to ensure that it gets independent feedback in different areas of the business.</p> <p>For example, to ensure the effectiveness of our community activities, the sustainability team commissioned an independent review of our current community partnerships. The recommendations are now being acted on.</p> <p>In order to ensure we understand the views of our audience, we carry out an annual readers' survey covering topics ranging from the quality of our editorial coverage to our environmental footprint.</p> <p>We also hold employee surveys to gauge the views of our staff.</p> <p>Two Tomorrows continue to work with us to independently audit our performance and carry out interviews with the senior management team and directors.</p> <p>We are also in the process of looking at the possibility of establishing a stakeholder advisory panel with internal and external delegates. It is hoped that the panel will not only play a key role in shaping the company's commitments and approach, but also be directly involved in the independent evaluation of how well the company is doing in achieving its goals.</p> <p>GNM had taken a leading role in creating a sustainability vision and strategy, known as the Power of 10, for all the businesses with GMG.</p> <p>However, due to the sale of the regional newspaper and radio businesses and the decision to hold Trader Media Group and Emap as arm's-length investments, the Power of 10 no longer has a relevance for the group.</p> <p>Amelia Fawcett, chair of GMG, continues in her role as group board champion for sustainability.</p>",
  "<p>Twisted, buckled and puckered leaves, bulging yellow veins and contorted growth going nowhere: damage by weedkiller residue is back. It never really went away, but its comeback promises even more widespread harm, and this time it's being egged on by journalism that could prove as harmful as the weedkiller itself.</p> <p>Since 2008, when reports of something nasty lurking in animal manure <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/29/food.agriculture\">first appeared</a>, a steady flow of new incidents of pollution caused by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminopyralid \">aminopyralid</a> have surfaced. This synthetic hormone weedkiller kills broad-leaved plants, by sending plant cells into a frenzy, but leaves grass unharmed, although it does enter it, binding to its fibres. If a cow or horse eats treated grass (fresh or as hay) the residue passes through the animal's gut, becoming the manure we crave. If that muck arrives on an allotment site, or is sold bagged in garden centres, there's trouble ahead.</p> <p>When we mix it into our soil and it rots, minuscule polluting traces of aminopyralid are set free, and sensitive plants, including potatoes, tomatoes, peas and beans, start to <a href=\"http://www.geologywales.co.uk/storms/summer-2011-aminopyralid.htm\">pucker, buckle and twist</a>, as their leaves and shoots go haywire. A deserved hoo-ha tightened the rules on aminopyralid's use, which should never have gotten into muck to start with.<br>But aminopyralid isn't the next chemical casting its long polluter's shadow across our plots, although it works in the same way, causes the same deformed growth, and is equally persistent. Its carrier isn't poisoned manure, but bags of contaminated compost and soil improver. Its origin isn't distant sprayed fields, but our own lawns. Move over aminopyralid, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clopyralid\">clopyralid</a>, found in some <a href=\"http://www.rhs.org.uk/media/pdfs/advice/WeedkillersForGardeners\">garden lawn weedkillers</a>, is the new home-grown polluter.</p> <p>The Sun newspaper's gardening column recently ran a story headlined \"Binfection\", with a dramatic opener: \"Disturbing reports reach us of weedkiller pollution in composts and manure.\" They got the pollution bit right, but the rest looks like a masterclass in agenda, rather than fact-driven journalism.</p> <p>The Sun tells us \"homeowners dump weedkiller-polluted mowings and diseased plant material in roadside bins and, where this is composted ... there is a risk infected material will result\". In fact, collected garden waste is composted, professionally, <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/bsi-pas-100-compost-specification\">to exacting standards</a> (and to high, disease-killing temperatures). Disease outbreaks arising from bought sowing, potting and multipurpose mixes containing composted green waste are rare. And \"weedkiller-polluted mowings\" are just that: pollution, not \"infection\".</p> <p>More drama: \"Mad cow disease resulted from feeding cattle infected food. But now we are raising plants in infected growing media rather than sterile peat or coir-based seed and potting composts.\" This skips the fact that mad cow disease resulted from plant-eating cows being fed on other dead cows. It's a terrible analogy - gardeners grow new plants using the composted remains of dead ones - but it's fine for scaremongering.</p> <p>Having been hit myself by it, I recently researched an <a href=\"http://www.hartley-botanic.co.uk/gardening-tips/john-walker/gardenings-own-goal/\">article</a> on weedkiller residue. Reports and pictures on the perils of aminopyralid and clopyralid pollution <a href=\"http://glallotments.co.uk/acmanure.html\">abound</a>. There is no question of how damaging these chemicals are, how they cause damage, or what it looks like.</p> <p>The Sun's article failed to mention by name aminopyralid or, crucially, clopyralid. It did not list lawn weedkillers containing clopyralid, so readers could check if they're using it. By neglecting to remind its readers to <a href=\"http://www.lovethegarden.com/files/ve-label.pdf\">not put clopyralid-treated lawn mowings out for collection</a>, it failed to help prevent it entering the compost-making stream. It failed to moot the idea that we can defuse this time bomb by calling for clopyralid's withdrawal. And it ignored a painful lesson which American gardeners learned long ago - when they were hit by clopyralid residue - which led to it being withdrawn there in 2002.</p> <p>Two weeks later, another headline: \"Weedkiller on loose: polluted compost is blight\". This second helping serves gardeners no better. It tells us: \"You have now written in with a series of related cautionary tales.\" Curiously, out of the six snippets taken from readers' letters, none describe specific symptoms of weedkiller damage, but do name other symptoms, including those of gardening in the most challenging summer ever.</p> <p>Again, The Sun tells us of the perils of using products containing green waste compost, but fails to mention that it's used not just in some peat-free compost, but in some peat-reduced products, too. It can't resist more unfounded alarmism, suggesting that green waste compost might carry \"...bacterial infections such as Legionnaire's disease.\" There is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-18206191\">no evidence</a> that anyone in the UK has caught the rare Legionella longbeachae from bagged compost.</p> <p>Again it fails to mention clopyralid or list the products containing it, does not urge readers to check if it's in their lawn weedkiller or remind them not to put treated mowings out for collection. And it fails to call, after learning others' lessons, for an end to clopyralid use in gardens. Why?</p> <p>The Sun's gardening column is a proponent of peat use, thereby encouraging the destructive mining of lowland raised peat bogs, primarily in Ireland and Europe. Peat is a <a href=\"http://www.puyallup.wsu.edu/~linda%20chalker-scott/horticultural%20myths_files/Myths/Horticultural%20%20peat.pdf\">non-renewable resource</a>. The Sun rails against the reliability of peat-free composts, many of which contain the composted green waste it is making great efforts to scare us about. So it's no surprise we're being urged to use \"...sterile peat or coir-based composts\".</p> <p>Peat-free composts may not be perfect, but they can be made from renewable resources, including what goes into our garden waste bins. I have <a href=\"http://earthfriendlygardener.net/2012/09/03/peat-free-reduced-compost-sowing-potting-multipurpose-recommend-top-choice-advice-using/\">trialled</a> over 30 peat-free composts this year, some of which contain or are made from green waste. The majority have performed just as well, if not better, than composts containing mined peat.</p> <p>Being a loyal champion of garden chemical use may explain why The Sun finds it hard to name the lawn weedkillers from which this entire problem springs. If the reporting of a serious problem is being tainted by an agenda, journalism is being distorted just as weedkiller residues twist plant growth. It's a kind of insidious pollution itself, symptomised by a clear failure to give gardeners the facts, while milking alarmism to the full.</p>",
  "<p>Part of Guardian News and Media's (GNM) sustainability vision is to be carbon positive, and we seek to move towards this long-term goal by maximising the influence of our editorial while at the same time minimising the negative impacts of our operations and business activities.</p> <p>Because we cannot measure our progress by quantitative metrics alone, it is not a firm target that we can say we will achieve by a certain date. We also recognise that changes in technology as well as legislation may affect our progress.</p> <p>However, it does set a clear direction for our sustainability strategy, and makes clear that the influence of our editorial content, or \"brainprint\", is key to our impact on society.</p> <p>Within editorial, carbon positive means using our open and collaborative approach to journalism to reach and engage with a global audience on issues ranging from climate change and resource use to biodiversity and social justice. We do this within our general news coverage but also through a number of our specialist websites. These include environment, global development, Guardian Sustainable Business, society and education. </p> <p>By educating and informing our global audience, we hope to help create the necessary conditions for political and social change.</p> <p>Of course, it is also important that we operate ourselves in the way we would wish to see others work. The Guardian has for many years been reducing its own footprint across its operations, ranging from offices and print sites to the newsprint the company purchases.</p> <p>Ensuring continued progress becomes more difficult now that the most obvious actions have been taken. GNM is also facing new challenges with the company's drive to become digital-first.</p> <p>For these reasons, GNM last year decided to review where it had got to and to put a more cohesive framework in place to ensure we are concentrating on the most important issues and are able to more effectively measure our progress. This has resulted in the creation of a carbon inventory to understand what data we do and don't collect as well as setting out the principles and rules for measuring our own performance.</p> <p>The framework is based on the following principles:</p> <ul> <li>We accept we do not have perfect knowledge or control over our impacts.</li> <li>We will set inventory boundaries according to our knowledge and resources.</li> <li>We will try to achieve best practice and encourage positive change within these borders.</li> <li>We intend to continually expand our boundaries of knowledge and influence to make better business decisions that support global sustainability.</li> </ul> <p>GNM uses the latest version of the international <a href=\"www.ghgprotocol.org/files/ghgp/public/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf\">Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative </a> (Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard1) as a guide in setting the framework of its greenhouse gas inventory. </p> <p>A review of the processes and activities undertaken at GNM has been mapped to identify where they are linked with the generation of greenhouse gases across the whole life cycle. The aim was to set out all the activities that are directly and indirectly related to GNM business processes covering traditional print media, digital media, as well as other commercial media and retail.</p> <p>It is assumed that these activities may generate GHG emissions as a result of the material inputs they draw into the system, the processing or activity itself, the intended outputs and any waste generated. </p> <p>As a result of this mapping, it was feasible to group GNM activities into five distinct areas or stages that occur within the media process and therefore form GNM's Media Life Cycle:</p> <p>Creation of editorial and commercial content and the development of media and commercial concept </p> <p>Production of the media or concept into a format or output that can be distributed to the consumer/audience </p> <p>Delivery of the media or output to consumer/audience for access or purchase</p> <p>Use and consumption of media or outputs by customer/audience</p> <p>Enable the customer/audience to take a direct action, inform opinion or behaviour change through the consumption of media or outputs</p> <p>While the process map provides a comprehensive picture of GNM's potential total carbon footprint, it is not realistic to maintain a carbon inventory that includes all emission sources. In line with best practice, GNM has set an initial inventory boundary that seeks to cover its primary emission sources. The aim is to progressively expand the boundary over consecutive years. </p> <p>In selecting emission sources for inclusion in the inventory, GNM has weighed a number of factors: </p> <ul> <li>Risk \u2013 the carbon intensity of the activity and stakeholder expectation</li> <li>Availability \u2013 the likely availability, quality and reliability of data</li> <li>Opportunity \u2013 the time and resources available to pursue this data</li> </ul> <p>Once the sources were prioritised, they were then categorised into four time boundaries or milestones for data collection or inclusion in the inventory.</p> <p>As a result of this body of work, GNM is going to concentrate on the following activities or emission/waste sources over the next one to three years:</p> <p><strong>Process</strong> (carbon) <br></p> <ul> <li>Contracted data centres and servers (CDNs) used to deliver online products</li> <li>Internet network and associated infrastructure, including use of consumer devices</li> <li>Display marketing, such as TV ads and posters</li> <li>Other transport steps (eg, distribution of contract print)</li> <li>Understanding the options and feasibility of measuring the impact our media content and services or brainprint</li> </ul> <p><strong>Material inputs</strong> (resources) <br></p> <ul> <li>Ink consumption at the print sites and contract printers</li> <li>Water consumption and disposal at offices, paper mills, GPCs and contract print sites</li> </ul> <p><strong>End of life</strong> (waste) <br></p> <ul> <li>The disposal of office and print waste to landfill/incineration and hazardous waste</li> <li>Recycling of paper and material at the print sites</li> </ul>",
  "<p>This year marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Guardian's Living our Values sustainability reporting. Reviews normally concentrate on one year's performance, but this anniversary offers an opportunity to look back at how much has been achieved and to look forward to what still needs to be done.</p> <h2>Looking back</h2> <p>When the sustainability team was created, there was no common set of values that were understood across the company, no measurement of our social or environmental performance, no community programme, no environmental or paper purchasing policies and few sustainable procurement practices.</p> <p>In other words, at that time there was a growing risk that the integrity of our organisation, even our editorial coverage, could be called into question. A small but telling example was that, back in 2002, we wrote an editorial calling for all companies to ban smoking in the workplace, yet continued to allow it in the Guardian's offices.</p> <p>So it is heartening to see that, 10 years on, we are now among the leaders in sustainability in the media world and beyond, and that the core weaknesses that were evident back then have largely been rectified. At the same time, we recognise that sustainability is a journey and that, however much has already been achieved, there is still plenty more that needs to be done.</p> <p>A decade ago, we were the only media company in the world to have an independently assured sustainability report and remain one of only a small number today. This complements the fact that we continue also to be one of the few media companies to have had an independent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/page/readerseditor\">readers' editor</a> in place for more than a decade.</p> <p>While the media landscape has changed radically over the past decade and the pace of change is unrelenting, it is also important to know what remains enduring and consistent.</p> <p>The opening paragraph of the inaugural report, signed off by the editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a> and then managing director Carolyn McCall, said: \"We embarked on this audit to ensure that our business operates in the spirit of the <a href=\"http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/the-scott-trust/\">Scott Trust</a>. </p> <p>Given that we produce progressive and enlightened newspapers, as well as write regularly about corporate social responsibility, we also wanted to reassure ourselves and others that we measure up to the high standards<br>our editorials expect of other companies.\" </p> <p>One of the great successes of the sustainability team has been to bring the values of the Guardian back to centre stage and ensure they were understood and acted on across all editorial and commercial departments.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/joconfino\">Jo Confino</a>, an executive editor at the Guardian, said: \"If, back then, you had asked the facilities management department, for example, how they were living up to the values of the Guardian, they would have struggled to understand the question, let alone answer it. Today, they would be able to explain in detail what they are doing and why and talk you through the targets they have set for further improvements.\"</p> <h2>The present</h2> <p>It is particularly satisfying for any corporate responsibility department to have an organisation's core corporate strategy incorporate key sustainability criteria.</p> <p>At GNM, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/open-journalism\">Open journalism</a> vision and strategy dovetails neatly into the core framework of our sustainability strategy, which is based on transparency, stakeholder engagement and accountability. It is also the case that the company's brand proposition is based on a restatement of the Guardian's original purpose of seeking social justice, but making it relevant to today's complex global inter-connected society.</p> <p>The essential purpose of the Guardian moving forward is based on the belief that a more open exchange of information, ideas and opinions has the power to change the world for the better and that open, connected networks of information, combining journalistic skills with the best of what others create, is a valuable form of knowledge.</p> <p>Stemming from this is a commitment to report, edit and curate content and information, collaborate widely and remain always open to challenge and to be challenged. In this way we believe we will empower those who interact with us.</p> <p>The hope is that, by bringing together diverse progressive minds, communities and organisations and providing them with information, we will motivate them to think and act for the better. </p> <p>All this aligns with the Guardian's long-standing editorial sustainability vision, which is to \"promote public debate and harness the power of our readers and users by creating online tools and projects that give them the opportunity to share knowledge and ideas, as well as encouraging them to make a difference as individuals and within their communities\". </p> <p>On a practical level, the sustainability team has also been at the forefront of the creation of specialist websites that support social and environmental justice, such as environment, global development and Guardian Sustainable Business.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Given the sustainability team's contribution in bringing the Scott Trust principles to the fore, where can the department add value now?</p> <p>Key is the recognition that, while it is directors and other managers who should be embedding sustainability into their departments, it is essential to have a specialist department that not only provides support and advice but also ensures that smart objectives, targets and improvement actions are set and met.</p> <p>The sustainability department also continues to manage GNM's community activities, which are an important manifestation of our core mission of promoting social justice, as well as producing and publishing this Living our Values audit.</p> <p>Not everything in the garden is rosy, however, and GNM's new business strategy, which aims to put the organisation on a sustainable financial footing within five years despite the decline of print revenues, has been disruptive to the sustainability programme. The need to reduce costs in order to fund investment in new technologies that will, in turn, help us ensure our journalism remains independent, puts pressure on everything that we do.</p> <p>But, in senior management interviews with Two Tomorrows, GNM's ethical auditors, there was a clear desire to ensure that sustainability is consciously integrated into business decision making.</p> <p>In its autumn 2011 letter to GNM directors, Two Tomorrows also stressed the need to align the sustainability strategy more closely to the core business goals in order to ensure that social, ethical, environmental and governance issues are considered more explicitly.</p> <p>The team has continued to work towards improving GNM's performance by working with all departments to align sustainability thinking with their business objectives, measure what they do, develop action plans and make them publicly accountable for what they do through our independent audit and the publication of our Living our Values sustainability report.</p> <p>This means that Open becomes an operating system not only of our journalism but also for all our commercial departments. </p> <p>The three core aims at the heart of the Living our Values 2015 strategy are:<br>Developing commercial sustainability (Profit)<br>Acting as an agent of change for good (People)<br>Reducing the net impacts of GNM (Planet)</p> <p>To be able to align these aims with GNM's transformation programme and editorial vision, the sustainability department has identified six priority themes. These themes provide a framework for shaping and delivering business performance through to 2015: </p> <ul> <li>Doing good business \u2013 building commercial partnerships for good; selling ethical products and services; increasing operational efficiency and reducing business risk</li> <li>Improving digital sustainability \u2013 optimise user experience of digital services to maximise accessibility; minimise energy and impacts on the climate and nature</li> <li>Enhancing audience engagement \u2013 open and honest relationships; championing social justice; open collaboration to build loyalty and influence positive sustainable change</li> <li>Empowering people and community \u2013 an ethical and empowering place to work; aligning business and community skills; empowering communities and promoting social value</li> <li>Low impact operations \u2013 making decisions, running our operations and investing in ways that protect the climate, human health, resources and natural abundance</li> <li>Responsible procurement \u2013 assess, procure and manage supply chains to protect human rights, internal labour standards, the environment and fight corruption.</li> </ul> <p>The risk with all sustainability strategies is that they can look good on paper but do not always translate into practical actions. That is often because employees do not see how it is relevant to their day-to-day activities.</p> <p>This is why the sustainability department has created an annual strategic planning process, which includes workshops with all non-editorial departments so that managers and staff can develop objectives and action plans to deliver company goals in line with our core sustainability aims. </p> <p>For example, enhancing revenues by offering innovative and responsible services, reducing costs through eco-efficiency, and being transparent and accountable to our audience and staff to build engagement aligns Living our Values 2015 with our transformation and digital first business plan. </p> <p>These objectives are being tracked quarterly, and the sustainability department will report annually on their progress through a set of key performance indicators (KPIs). Long-term targets will also be developed against these KPIs. </p> <p>To ensure that staff were given an appropriate framework in which to define their objectives/priorities, the sustainability team took into consideration a number of pieces of research and information, including the Scott Trust values, the company's key objectives as well as external stakeholder feedback, such as the readers' survey and recommendations to the board from our ethical auditors Two Tomorrows. </p> <p>Experience has shown that sustainability needs board support if it is to have any chance of being embedded into a company. This is why each GNM director has personal objectives linked to sustainability.</p> <h2>Directors' objectives</h2> <p>Directors personal objectives for 2012-13 have been set and approved to align responsibility for delivering the LoV action plans with board-level directors. What this means is that directors will achieve their personal objectives only if the departments they are responsible for meet their LoV objectives. This is set out below:</p> <p><strong>(To be confirmed), director responsible for all commercial departments</strong></p> <p>Personal objective: enhance commercial opportunities and the business model by building partnerships based on our brand values to actively do good</p> <p>Strategic Living Our Values priorities: good business, enhancing audience engagement and empowering people and community</p> <p>Departments covered: business and professional, consumer media</p> <p><strong>Carolyn Gray, director responsible for human resources, sustainability and safety</strong></p> <p>Personal objective: using our brand to build an open, ethical and empowering place to work that delivers commercial, personal and social value</p> <p>Strategic Living Our Values priorities: empowering people and community, and enhancing audience engagement</p> <p>Departments covered: HR and diversity sustainability </p> <p><strong>Sheila Fitzsimons, director responsible for business and editorial operations</strong></p> <p>Personal objective: maintaining our values within our business operational decisions and day-to-day activities to build a sustainable future</p> <p>Strategic Living Our Values priorities: low-impact operations, good business, and people and community</p> <p>Departments covered: operations</p> <p><strong>Tanya Cordrey, director responsible for digital development and delivery</strong></p> <p>Personal objective: develop sustainability&#xa0;principles for digital products, and optimise the software and hardware estate for&#xa0;sustainability&#xa0;where possible</p> <p>Strategic Living Our Values priorities: improving digital&#xa0;sustainability, responsible procurement, and low operational impacts</p> <p>Departments covered:digital development</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Cornaby, director responsible for finance and procurement</strong></p> <p>Personal objective: mitigate business risk and enhance commercial opportunities through better sustainability data management and supplier contractual arrangements. </p> <p>Strategic Living Our Values priorities: responsible procurement, doing good business, and low-impact operations</p> <p>Departments covered: finance, operations \u2013 workplace management</p>",
  "<h2>Sustainability vision</h2> <p>Our vision is to be a leader on sustainability within the media industry. Through our editorial coverage and business activities, we will demonstrate to readers, staff, advertisers, suppliers and our communities that Guardian News and Media is committed to enhancing society's ability to build a sustainable future.</p> <p>Our long-term ambition is to be carbon positive. We will move towards this goal by maximising the influence of our editorial content while at the same time minimising the negative impacts of our operations and business activities. </p> <h2>Editorial</h2> <p>Clearly, our greatest impact comes from informing and influencing our global audience. We will therefore build on our position as a recognised leader in the reporting of environmental and social justice issues, by providing the most comprehensive news coverage on subjects such as climate change, environmental degradation and social inequality.</p> <p>These topics will be explored from the social, economic, political and scientific perspectives, both nationally and globally.</p> <p>We will promote public debate and harness the power of our readers and users by creating online tools and projects that give them the opportunity to share knowledge and ideas, as well as encouraging them to make a difference, both as individuals and within their communities.</p> <p>Social justice has always been at the heart of our journalism and we will consistently give a voice to disadvantaged communities around the world most affected by climate change.</p> <h2>Commercial</h2> <p>GNM's reputation puts us in a strong position to benefit from the growing trend in businesses moving towards a more sustainable future. We will support our large existing clients in this endeavour as well as enabling small and emerging companies to develop their markets.</p> <p>We recognise that tensions can arise between our need for advertising revenues to sustain our business and being a medium for promoting consumption. Our role is neither to hector our readers nor to censor on their behalf. Our editorial coverage informs and influences our audience in their choices.</p> <p>We will work with our readers and users to gain a deeper understanding of what products and services they want in this area, and use this knowledge to engage with our advertisers and sponsors on the issue of sustainability.</p> <h2>Operational</h2> <p>Our offices, data centres and print sites will meet the highest environmental standards. We commit to sustainable and considered consumption and maximising the efficiency of all resource use. We will avoid and reduce unnecessary energy use, and where possible will use renewables. We will ensure that appropriate systems are in place to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change on our operations.</p> <p>Sustainability will be at the heart of our procurement processes as we recognise that our suppliers represent a key part of our operational impact. We will consistently increase the amount of recycled and certified virgin newsprint in our products. We will continue to improve our understanding of our impacts by developing our knowledge of whole life cycles systems. We work across the industry to minimise the ecological footprint of our print, digital and commercial media services and products.</p> <h2>People</h2> <p>We will empower and inspire everyone who works at GNM to act by encouraging sustainable behaviour. We will achieve this through leadership, raising awareness and incentives to make it easier for all of us to act responsibly. We will also work in partnership with our local and global communities to address their social and environmental needs, by highlighting the issues and providing volunteering, resources and funding.</p>",
  "<p>The past year has been among the most extraordinary in our history. We have broken stories that have shaped the news agenda around the world and, in doing so, built a global audience for our journalism that is larger and more active than could have been imagined just a few years ago. </p> <p>We have successfully embarked on a long-term transformation strategy that will see us not just survive the inexorable shift from print to digital but thrive as a result of it. We have made the idea of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/open-journalism\">Open journalism</a> \u2013 journalism that is enriched by the direct contribution of readers \u2013 a reality.</p> <p>However, for all of our achievements, Guardian News and Media (GNM) continues to face some daunting challenges. Along with all other newspaper publishers, we are driving into fierce financial headwinds caused by the decline of revenues from print sales and advertising. The regulation and legislation that governs our industry is under such intense scrutiny (in large part due to the results of our own work) that it would not an exaggeration to suggest that a battle is raging for the soul of journalism here and around the world. As our audience grows, so does the challenge of staying true to our progressive, liberal values while reflecting a broad range of opinions.</p> <p>In order to ensure that we meet these challenges, in 2011 GNM embarked on a five-year transformation strategy designed to ensure that the business is sustainable financially and able to make the most of the opportunities presented by the various digital platforms.</p> <p>GNM's unique ownership structure \u2013 which ensures it is free of proprietorial or market influence \u2013 means that profit is not our motive. However, we do need to ensure that we are commercially viable and that GNM can easily be sustained by its parent company, <a href=\"http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/\">Guardian Media Group</a>. </p> <p>One year into the transformation strategy, GNM is performing as planned. Digital revenues grew by over 16% in the financial year ending 1 April 2012 to \u00a345.7m, largely offsetting the decline in print revenues for the first time. But the costs involved in creating new digital platforms and ways of working pushed the organisation to an operating loss before exceptional items and amortisation of \u00a344.2m. Details of the financial performance of GNM and parent company Guardian Media Group (GMG) are available in the company's <a href=\"http://www.gmgannualreview2012.co.uk/\">annual report</a>. </p> <p>This loss was expected at this stage of the plan, and the growth in digital revenue demonstrates the potential of the new platforms we are developing, but the financial challenge remains clear. In order to help us meet that, the five-year plan calls for GNM to make sustainable cost savings of \u00a325m by 2017, and that has led to difficult decisions being made about spending priorities and to the departure of some valued colleagues.</p> <p>The savings we are making are not simply cuts to spending; they let us invest in the future of our publications. Over the past year, we have reinvented the Monday-to-Friday newspaper and beefed up our digital development and digital sales teams. We have pioneered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog\">live blogging</a> and opened up our newsroom and launched a number of highly popular digital products \u2013 including apps for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/iphone/guardian\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/ipad/guardian-ipad-edition\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/android/guardian\">Android</a> and <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/\">Facebook</a> \u2013 to expand our reach, find new ways of growing and involving our audiences and build new revenue streams. </p> <p>We have attracted more than 200,000 members to our professional networks and we've begun a digital-only operation in the US, which is already exceeding its audience targets.</p> <p>As a result of this innovative approach, we are seeing rapid growth in digital audiences. Our iPad app was downloaded more than 800,000 times in the year ending March 2012. The Facebook app was installed 9.4m times over the same period, bringing our content to a new, younger audience. </p> <p>Our website, theguardian.com, enjoyed an audience of 67.8m monthly unique browsers, a 38% growth on March 2011, and our mobile site reaches more than 8m unique browsers a month. Independent third-party research data released in March 2012 showed that, in Britain, the unduplicated combined weekly print and digital readership of the Guardian and The Observer reached 5.8m in the calendar year 2011, exceeding that of The Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph for the first time.</p> <p>So, beyond fulfilling our core purpose of holding power to account, we continue to lead the way in the development of a new form of journalism that puts our audience at the heart of what we do. Our approach to this is encapsulated in our commitment to Open journalism.</p> <p>In essence, we believe in the open exchange of information, ideas and opinions and its power to bring about change. We also champion open, connected networks (of news, comment and data), which combine journalistic skills with the best of what others create.</p> <p>This has many forms of expression, ranging from opening up our content to comments and collaborating with our users on complex investigations, to inviting thousands of readers into the Guardian for our unique <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/open-weekend\">Open Weekend</a>. </p> <p>While we want to be open, we also recognise that our aim is not to be all things to all people but to support those progressive individuals around the world who share our liberal values.</p> <p>Those values are what set us apart. They infuse everything we do, and we recognise the importance of staying true to them. This is why it is important that we create the report you are reading now, Living our Values. Our integrity and the trust of our readers is based not only on what we present to the outside world but how we operate. </p> <p>This is the 10th anniversary of our sustainability reporting, and the reason for engaging in this work is perhaps even more relevant now than it was then, given the complexity of the media world and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/leveson-inquiry\">Leveson inquiry</a> into the ethics of the fourth estate.</p> <p>In the inaugural report for 2002-03 editor-in-chief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger\">Alan Rusbridger</a> wrote: \"Given that we produce progressive and enlightened newspapers, as well as write regularly about corporate social responsibility, we also wanted to reassure ourselves and others that we measure up to the high standards our editorials expect of other companies.\"</p> <p>The Guardian was the first media company to have its sustainability report independently audited, because we believe that we should offer our stakeholders the same level of scrutiny of our performance as we expect from others.</p> <p>We are delighted that our method of accountability has been acclaimed by an academic study that suggests it offers a method of self-regulation that other media companies would do well to follow.</p> <p>For example, a study by the school of journalism at the Southern Illinois University Carbondale concludes that \"it is difficult not to be impressed by the comprehensiveness of the Guardian's sustainability effort and the degree of transparency with which it has been communicated to stakeholders\".</p> <p>The Guardian has also led the way in creating other ways in which we can be held to account, such as the independent readers' editors in place at both the Guardian and the Observer.</p> <p>The prospects for news companies across the world are uncertain, and most traditional media companies are struggling to cope with the transformation of the industry. Many have slashed their editorial budgets and closed their news bureaux around the world.</p> <p>Guardian News and Media is fortunate that it started its transition to a digital business ahead of many of its competitors, which means that a quarter of its total revenues now come from its non-traditional operations.</p> <p>But we recognise the road ahead will continue to be chaotic, complex and fast-moving, and we will need to remain on our toes to meet the challenges ahead. We're not pretending to have all the answers. But, unlike many of our traditional newspaper competitors, we believe we have an inspiring vision for the future of our journalism, a unique and powerful brand proposition, and a robust and clearly articulated strategy for achieving our aims. Which means that, in an ever more crowded, converged and commoditised media world, the Guardian occupies a clear space of its own.</p>",
  "<p>George Osborne's goal of building an economy that can pay its way in the world looks more distant than ever as official statistics showed Britain ran up the largest current account deficit on record in the second quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the \u00a320.8bn deficit \u2013 which includes the UK's trade balance, as well as the shortfall on overseas investments by UK plc \u2013 was the biggest ever for a quarter.</p> <p>\"Efforts to rebalance the economy towards net trade may be foundering on the wilting economic outlook in the UK's principal European trading partners,\" said Chris Crowe, of Barclays.</p> <p>The news came as the ONS revealed that the recession-hit economy contracted by 0.4% in the second quarter, slightly less than its previous 0.5% estimate, fuelling hopes that growth may have returned between July and September.</p> <p>\"Latest data and survey evidence overall suggest that there is a good chance that GDP growth in the third quarter will more than outweigh the GDP contraction suffered in the second quarter,\" said Howard Archer of consultancy IHS Global Insight.</p> <p>Labour said the upward revision of the growth figures was good news, but warned that the economy remained fragile. The shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, said: \"While any small upward revision is clearly better than the opposite, these figures confirm our economy is in the longest double-dip recession since the second world war. And that is the reason why the deficit is rising \u2013 up by 22% so far this year.\"</p> <p>The ONS said the quarter's trade deficit on goods \u2013 \u00a328.1bn \u2013 was the largest ever recorded, despite the Treasury's efforts to inspire a \"march of the makers\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, a shortfall on financial transactions with the rest of the world, as foreign companies made more on their investments here than UK plc banked from foreign ventures, meant the deficit on Britain's income account in the quarter, at \u00a35.2bn, was also the largest ever, adding to the current account deficit.</p> <p>These \"balance of payments\" statistics, as they are known, were once a hot political issue, which has faded away in recent decades, since the liberalisation of financial markets allowed firms and countries to ramp up their borrowing to fill the gap.</p> <p>But with the Treasury aiming to \"rebalance\" the economy from unsustainable consumer spending towards exports, the record deficit raises fresh doubts about whether the government's economic strategy is working.</p> <p>There was further evidence that consumers were tightening their belts in the detailed figures, with household spending down 0.2% over the quarter. The ONS said the largest declines were in restaurants and hotels, tobacco, and food and drink, as cash-crunched families cut back on treats.</p> <p>One piece of positive news for the economic outlook was a rise in business investment, which the ONS said rose by 0.9% over the quarter.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, of data-provider Markit, said: \"While this is still only a modest improvement in the investment picture, it is an encouraging sign with regard to corporate health.\"</p> <p>John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"The revision to GDP is welcome news, but we're not out of the woods yet. Our research shows that small business confidence remained weak in Q3 and we believe growth will continue to be flat in the coming months.</p> <p>\"Clearly employment is key to lifting sentiment and we need to see more people in full time work. The FSB believes extending the National Insurance contributions holiday to all small firms across the UK will go some way to helping to create the jobs that are needed.\"</p>",

  "<p>South Sudan's rainy season has overwhelmed aid efforts in refugee camps sheltering more than 100,000 Sudanese refugees in Maban county, say international aid agencies.</p> <p>The remote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/26/refugees-flee-to-south-sudan-camps\" title=\"\">Jamam</a> camp, about 75km west of the border with Sudan, is one of the worst affected, effectively cut off because of roads made impassable by rains. But conditions are bad across the region, according to <a href=\"http://www.internationalmedicalcorps.org.uk/\" title=\"\">International Medical Corps UK</a> (IMC).</p> <p>\"Flooding has inundated our compounds outside the camps and staff now have to sleep in the refugee camps in the clinic,\" said Sean Casey, IMC country director for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan\" title=\"\">South Sudan</a>. \"It is also difficult to get supplies in, as the river is swallowing up our vehicles.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies warn of a major outbreak of diseases such as hepatitis E, malaria and cholera due to severe malnutrition, water shortages and contaminated drinking water. At least 16 refugees have died from an outbreak of the water-borne hepatitis E in the past few weeks, <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-09-21/new-sites-south-sudan-refugee-camps-must-be-found-blue-nile-confli\" title=\"\">according to Oxfam</a>, and there are fears this number could rise.</p> <p>\"We've got an emergency on our hands which is worsening day by day and it has the potential to get bigger with more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">refugees</a> coming in,\" said Casey. \"We have huge logistical constraints and a very vulnerable population. Hepatitis E is a new challenge, along with concerns about water supply and our capacity to respond because of access constraints.\"</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/17/south-sudan-border-conflict-sudan?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">a year of conflict</a> between Sudanese government troops in Blue Nile state and South Kordofan, 80,000 refugees have fled across the border into South Sudan, to the inhospitable region of Maban county, now housing 106,000 refugees.</p> <p>Maban county's four refugee camps face recurrent flooding due to heavy rains in September and October. Overflowing rivers and flooding make conditions treacherous for refugees and aid agencies, and creating infrastructure to hold the water back has proved impossible. \"Resources on all sides are really limited and food is taking priority,\" said Casey. \"If we can't get supplies through, then hepatitis E will be just one of many concerns.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies are beginning to move the 20,000-30,000 refugees from Jamam to Gendrassa, a refugee camp 70km away that so far remains untouched by flooding.</p> <p>Oxfam and IMC claim this is only a short-term solution due to overcrowded camps; the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UN Refugee Agency</a> estimates another 60,000 people will arrive from Sudan in November and December, when the dry season makes movement possible.</p> <p>According to IMC, one in five children in the refugee camps is malnourished. The global acute malnutrition rate stands at about 22% for children under five and 32% for pregnant women and new mothers.</p> <p>\"Malnutrition among pregnant woman and new mothers is the worst, and they are also more susceptible to hepatitis E,\" said Casey, who suspects malnutrition is particularly high among women because they give food to children and men first.</p> <p>Casey said malnutrition could also be attributed to a delay in the arrival of rations. Exacerbating the problem further, the supplies include a wheat that must be crushed before cooking, which means women have to sell a share of their food to be able to prepare their meals.</p> <p>Maban county is among the most remote and least developed areas in South Sudan. During the rains, the only way to get aid in is by plane or boat. Oxfam says this \u2013 combined with the high cost of fuel, and the scarcity of materials caused by South Sudan's conflict-fuelled economic crisis \u2013 has made the humanitarian response in Maban one of the world's most expensive.</p> <p>\"A lot of aid workers in Maban have said that this is the hardest place they have worked,\" said Casey. \"It is hard to find even the most basic things, like enough food to feed staff. It's becoming clear we are going to need another site. Many may need to be moved outside Maban, [because] it's all under water, just a mud soup.\"</p> <p>Oxfam has also called on the government of South Sudan and the international community to prioritise finding new sites. Pauline Ballaman, head of Oxfam's emergency response in Maban, said: \"The Maban camps alone are not the answer to the crisis. There is simply not enough ground water to sustain so many people, and now heavy rains have left people wading through mud to get basic services. So far, agencies have managed to prevent a major crisis during the rainy season. However, agencies cannot keep trucking in water and air-dropping food year after year. If the refugees stay where they are, this will require a sustained supply of funding.\"</p> <p>Casey said the ideal solution to the crisis in Maban county is for Sudan to allow humanitarian access to civilians affected by the fighting in Blue Nile and South Kordofan, where Khartoum is trying to quell rebel movements backed by South Sudan.</p> <p>The leaders of Sudan and South Sudan have reached a deal that will allow for the resumption of oil exports. Earlier this year, a dispute over oil transit fees prompted South Sudan to shut down shipments, but the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan have since brokered an agreement that will allow for the resumption of oil exports. Salva Kiir, the South Sudanese president, said the two countries would sign a \"protocol of collaboration\" on Thursday, but disputes about the contested Abyei region and border demarcation have yet to be resolved.</p>",

If it works, and the Lib Dems remain in government after 2015 (at a conference fringe I heard one speaker joking about young people in 2020 talking about having lived all their adult lives \"under a Lib Dem government), Clegg will be seen as one of the great political figures of our age.

Stubborn and principled, they ignored the cynics who mocked them. They simply refused to give up on their dreams. They refused to accept that Liberals would never again be in government. And they refused to accept that Liberalism, that most decent, enlightened and British of creeds, which did so much to shape our past, would not shape our future. We think we\u2019ve got it tough now. But it was much, much tougher in their day. It was only their resolve, their resilience and their unwavering determination that kept the flickering flame of Liberalism alive through our party\u2019s darkest days.</p> <p>At our last conference in Gateshead, I urged you to stop looking in the rear view mirror as we journey from the party of opposition that we were, to the party of government we are becoming. But before we head off on the next stage of our journey, I want you to take one last look in that mirror to see how far we\u2019ve come. I tell you what I see.</p> <p>I see generations of Liberals marching towards the sound of gunfire. And yes, I see them going back to their constituencies to prepare for government.

They never flinched, and nor should we. We owe it to them to seize the opportunity they gave us, but which they never had. Taking on the vested interests. Refusing to be bullied. Refusing to give up. Always overturning the odds. Fighting for what we believe in, because we know that nothing worthwhile can be won without a battle. A fair, free and open society. That\u2019s the prize.

It's embargoed until 3pm, which means I'm now free to publish. So, here goes...</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg said he would not allow the top rate of income tax to be cut below 45% during this parliament.</strong> When George Osborne announced it was being cut from 50% to 45% in the spring budget, many Tories expressed the hope that this would be the first step towards getting it down to 40%, the level it used to be before Labour raised it during the credit crunch. Osborne reportedly wanted to take it down to 40% in one go. But Clegg said he would not accept any further change before 2015.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p \u2013 a level, let\u2019s not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour\u2019s 13 years in office \u2013 there can be no question of reducing it further in this parliament. All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on? It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 But he defended the decision to cut the top rate of income tax from 50% to 45% in the spring budget.</strong> He said he had \u201cinsisted\u201d on getting an increase in the tax allowance into the budget and that he had \u201cconceded\u201d the top rate tax cut. But he said he stood by the decision as a whole.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Why? Because as liberals, we want to see the tax on work reduced, the tax on unearned wealth increased, and the system as a whole tilted in favour of those on low and middle incomes. The budget delivered all three.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He announced that Paddy Ashdown will return to the Lib Dem frontline, taking charge of the party's 2015 election campaign.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can announce today that Paddy Ashdown has agreed to front up our campaign as chair of the 2015 general election team. I must admit, I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019m ready for all those urgent emails and 5am phone calls. But I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather have by my side. Paddy, it\u2019s great to have you back.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems should stop speculating about what they might do in the event of a hung parliament because this was ultimately a decision for the electorate.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the fringe of this conference about our party\u2019s next steps; about our relationship with the other parties; and about what we should do in the event of another hung parliament. It\u2019s the sort of discussion politicians love \u2013 full of speculation and rumour. But I have to tell you, it is all based on a false, and deeply illiberal, assumption: that it is we, rather than the people, who get to decide. In a democracy, politicians take their orders from the voters.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that the Lib Dems were the only party who could be trusted on the economy and trust to deliver a fairer society.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused Labour, and particularly Ed Balls, of financial irresponsibility</strong>. Balls was mentioned three times, while Ed Miliband was not mentioned at all. Clegg claimed that the poor suffered the most as a result of Labour's mismanagement of the economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour may have thought it was funny, after crashing the economy and racking up record debts, to leave a note on David Laws\u2019 desk saying: \u201cthere\u2019s no money left\u201d. But it\u2019s no joke for the most vulnerable in our society; the people Labour claim to represent but let down the most. So let\u2019s take no more lectures about betrayal. It was Labour who plunged us into austerity and it is we, the Liberal Democrats, who will get us out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he accused Balls of offering \u201ca fantasy world where there is no 'boom and bust' and the money never runs out\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He also attacked Conservatives who believe deregulation is the best solution to the country's economic problems.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The idea that if government just deregulated a bit more as Liam Fox proposes, or borrowed and spent a bit more as Ed Balls proposes, we would, at a stroke, achieve strong and lasting growth, is just not credible. In my experience, if you\u2019re being attacked by Liam Fox from one side, and Ed Balls from the other, you\u2019re in the right place.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government was willing to act \u201cagain and again and again\u201d to get growth going.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Plan A really was as rigid and dogmatic as our critics claim, I\u2019d be demanding a Plan B, and getting Danny and Vince to design it. But it isn\u2019t. Which is why you were right, earlier this week, to overwhelmingly reject the call for us to change our economic course. We have taken big and bold steps to support demand and boost growth. And we stand ready to do so again and again and again until self-sustaining growth returns.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He launched a veiled attack on the Conservatives for not fully supporting green growth.</strong> The Lib Dems would \u201chold [the Conservatives] to their promises\u201d on the environment, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will not succeed in this last task unless we can see off that most short-sighted of arguments: that we have to choose between going green and going for growth. Decarbonising our economy isn\u2019t just the right thing to do; it\u2019s a fantastic economic opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that austerity was essential because, if Britain lost control of its finances, it would lose its independence</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the coming years, some countries will get their own house in order. But some will not. Those that do will continue to write their own budgets, set their own priorities and shape their own futures. But those that do not will find their right to self-determination withdrawn by the markets, and new rules imposed by their creditors, without warning or clemency.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He suggested that welfare spending was too high.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the things about governing is it forces you to confront the inconvenient truths oppositions choose to ignore. Like the fact that, over the last 50 years, our economy has grown threefold, but our welfare spending is up sevenfold.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He defined liberalism as giving people \u201cthe freedom to be who you are, the opportunity to be who you could be\u201d.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems must give up being a party of protest.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that there are some in the party \u2013 some in this hall even \u2013 who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from right and left, as we work every day to keep this government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He confirmed that the government would give secondary schools a \u201ccatch-up premium\u201d, allowing them to spend \u00a3500 on help for children arriving from primary who are behind in English or maths.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that extremists could take over in the west if governments responded in the wrong way to the threat posed by the global power shift.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The potential consequences of this shift in power, should we in the west fail to respond, cannot be overstated. Our influence in the world, our standard of living, our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance \u2013 all are in the balance. For power would move not only away from the liberal and democratic world, but within it too; from moderates to hardliners, from internationalists to isolationists, from those committed to the politics of cooperation to those hell-bent on confrontation. If history has taught us anything, it is that extremists thrive in tough times.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He attacked the \u201cculture of instant celebrity\u201d.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For most people, success doesn\u2019t come easy or quick. That\u2019s what our culture of instant celebrity obscures: that real achievement in the real world takes time, effort, perseverance, resilience.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T14:39:52.662Z\">at 3.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-506308f6c0e327c3f7c905f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T13:53:58.777Z\">2.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's Elaine Woodard, from Meon Valley.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8JZYdFe5Tfc&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-506308b058f9bdd2eeba0288\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T13:52:48.832Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Helene Mulholland</strong> has been talking to delegates about how the conference has gone.

We are reliant of the bank of mum and dad and it's terrible for social mobility. Reliance on the pension of mum and dad would make a bad situation even worse.

Or not. \"Does it work, or if it does work does it have so many negative consequences we shouldn't do it any more?\" posed Cable. \"At some point in the next few months the question will arise, unless growth spontaneously returns, do you do more of it, [and] how do you do it?\"</p> <p>At the same event, John Cridland, the CBI's director general, suggested the major employers' and industrialists' group was open to the government committing to a target to decarbonise the UK's power sector by 2030 - a major commitment which would mean, effectively, that no gas, oil or coal plants could be used to generate electricity in less than two decades time unless still untenable technology was developed to capture and store the carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Asked if the CBI would support the target being included in the up-coming Electricity Market Reform bill, Cridland repllied: \"I'm not yet persuaded, but that doesn't mean I'm against it.\" If the CBI was satisfied that including the target would not create \"target fatigue\" and would not delay the bill, \"I'd look at it again\", he added.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-64dc14b6-d64e-4d5c-9471-6703f14f7d1f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348665983427/3b65d812-6578-4b73-88be-0d883e3ce1fa-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Vince Cable listens on as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vince Cable sits as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.

It's far too broad, it doesn't work technically.

So here we go - my list of 10 things we've learnt from the Lib Dem conference.</p> <p><strong>1. Nick Clegg is trying to forge the Liberal Democrats into a new party \u2013 but his creation is on electoral life-support and it is not yet clear whether it has a viable future.</strong> The Lib Dems used to be a receptacle for the protest vote, buoyed by the hope that electoral reform would eventually give them 100-plus seats in the Commons, but now the protest vote is going elsewhere and, with PR and Lords reform (backdoor PR) off the agenda for years, Clegg is trying to turn the Lib Dems into a mainstream party that can win by first-past-the-post. As Matthew d'Ancona put it <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/9544637/Cleggmania-is-now-nothing-but-a-distant-memory.html\">in a column recently,</a> he wants \u201cnothing less than to create a third party of government; not an electoral dumping ground for the Undecideds, the Outraged and People Who Still Hate Blair, but a party ready to participate in future coalitions and bring its own distinctive approach to bear on government\u201d. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/9493952/Lib-Dems-face-near-wipeout-in-2015-poll-warns.html\">with the polls as they are, </a>this new entity could face virtual electoral wipeout in 2015.</p> <p><strong>2. The Lib Dems seem more committed to ever to the coalition.</strong> This seems strange, given the fact that the decision to go into coalition has led to their collapse in the polls, but the party seems to have realised that it has past the point of no return. It may not know where its journey will end up, but the bridge back to April 2010 is in cinders. The clearest sign of this came when the party endorsed the coalition's key economic strategy, decisively rejecting a call for a Plan B. Clegg also made the point convincingly <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/speeches_detail.aspx?title=Nick_Clegg%E2%80%99s_rally_speech_at_Liberal_Democrat_Autumn_Conference&amp;pPK=ccad70de-e202-43a8-8778-27555c5e6503\">in his speech to the conference rally on Saturday night.</a> \u201cThis is the first time anyone in modern Britain has experienced a national coalition government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must show them it is a form of government that works well for them. If we don\u2019t we will have lost not only the argument for having Liberal Democrats in power but for having a third party at all.\u201d In other words, the Lib Dems face an existential threat, and if the coalition fails, the Lib Dems are doomed too.</p> <p><strong>3. The Lib Dems are seeking to reassert their identity \u2013 and the mansion tax, civil liberties and green growth at the heart of it</strong>. Although events have run relatively smoothly on the conference floor, the realisation that the Lib Dems will have to fight an election as a party of government for the first time has triggered an intense debate about the party's identity that has overshadowed events on the fringe. The most provocative contribution came from Richard Reeves, Clegg's former director of strategy, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/09/case-truly-liberal-party\">whose appeal for undiluted liberalism</a> was seen as an attempt to push the party to the right, but many Lib Dems strongly disagree (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">8.46am)</a> and think the party would be mad to give up on leftish voters who are attracted by the party's social democratic instincts. The Lib Dems have not resolved the right/left argument, but this week has shown members can unite around three themes: taxing the wealthy (the mansion tax has been championed ad nauseam), defending civil liberties (the leadership got trounced on secret courts, in the best debate on the conference) and green growth (which has become a key dividing line with the Tories).</p> <p><strong>4. Clegg intends to fight the next election.</strong> Clegg has always said he intends to fight the next election, but now, for the first time, people like me are starting to believe that he really means it. Partly that's because of his decision to issue his apology, which would not make much sense if he was planning to abandon ship in 2014. And partly because it's because people who know him well seem to be increasingly certain that he is going to stay on. Sometimes it's the gossip that is particularly persuasive. In the past there were suggestions that his wife Miriam wanted Clegg to stand down before 2015, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/22/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-2012#block-505db576c0e38ada80016272\">at the weekend the Financial Times reported that she's opposed to Clegg taking a job in Brussels,</a> because she has decided that the city is too provincial.</p> <p><strong>5. There will be no imminent leadership challenge.</strong> Clegg's personal ratings are dire, but there has been no serious challenge to his leadership <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">(Lembit Opik doesn't count)</a> and for the moment his position is perfectly safe. But it might be different in 2013, and as for 2014 \u2013 book your tickets for the conference now. If Clegg has not already suffered an attempt to depose him by then, 2014 should be the moment for a showdown.</p> <p><strong>6. Vince Cable is the party's undisputed leader-in-waiting.</strong> Cable has not done anything disloyal in Brighton, but he used his speech on Monday to advertise his availability, and his credentials as someone who could work with Labour or the Tories, and, with a clutch of polls showing that the party would do better under his leadership, he is now, for the moment, the overwhelming favourite to succeed Clegg. Tim Farron's prospects seem dimmer than they did last year and Chris Huhne \u2013 whose absence leaves Lib Dem firepower much weaker than it was \u2013 is of course, er, otherwise engaged.</p> <p><strong>7. Election manifestos are going to look different in the future because they will clearly differentiate between non-negotiable promises and negotiable ones.</strong> The Lib Dem tuition fee experience, and Clegg's apology, has focused attention on how the party can avoid this problem in the future. \u201cAll parties will need to be more upfront with the British people on what 'tablet of stone' stuff, and the other [promises] that will depend on circumstances,\u201d Clegg said yesterday.</p> <p><strong>8. Coalition government is making government more open.</strong> In the past ministers used to row in private and defend their collective decisions in public. When the coalition launched the two parties tried to play down their differences in public, but now Clegg and his colleagues are so open about their differences with their Tory colleagues that, as this week has demonstrated, it has almost stopped being a story. Danny Alexander proposed a motion implicitly attacking his boss, George Osborne, and the media barely batted an eyelid. Conversations that used to take place behind closed doors are now being conducted in public. It's a notable shift in Whitehall culture.</p> <p><strong>9. The Lib Dems are still overwhelmingly white and male.</strong> The party has no ethnic minority MPs and there seem to be very few ethnic minority delegates at the conference. We have not had a speech from a high-profile Lib Dem woman, although Jo Swinson <a href=\"http://markreckons.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/jo-swinson-could-be-our-next-leader.html\">(who is being tipped as a future leader) </a>may fill the gap when she speaks. In diversity terms, this party has a very long way to go.</p> <p><strong>10. But it's a great party to join if you want to speak at a party conference.</strong> This week has confirmed that the Lib Dems are still the only main party in British politics who are genuinely comfortable about letting their members debate politics. Labour and the Tories use their conferences to showcase their leaders and their rising stars. If you want to go to party conference, and get involved in debates and speak repeatedly, I'm afraid you haven't got much option. You'll have to join the Lib Dems.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T11:47:56.335Z\">at 12.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5062db8dc0e327c3f7c905d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T10:40:13.359Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's more on the planning vote.

It will actually slow it down. You just wonder what planet some of these people are on. <br>\"Just for once these parliamentarians should listen to the little people on the district councils who actually know most about this. Just listen to them and take these stupid ideas away.\" <br>Richard Fagence, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: \"This is not just a mistake, in my opinion. This is a huge mistake. <br>\"Don't even get me started on extensions. <br>\"My back garden is wider than it is deep, if you see what I mean. It's about 32ft deep but you could now develop an extension 26ft deep in old money. <br>\"The motion calls on the coalition government to withdraw these proposals. I would add one word to that: immediately.\" <br>Prue Bray, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said: \"This is not the first coalition policy forced on the party. <br>\"We know in coalition we cannot have everything we want. We understand the need for confidentiality in government. <br>\"But surely it is not beyond us as a party to come up with a better way for the party and parliamentarians to work together so we can avoid situations like this?\" <br>Tim Ward, from Cambridge, said the plans were \"both unnecessary and damaging\". <br>\"Every time one of these daft ideas arrives from government, I have to direct one of my senior officer to researching, analysing and responding to the consultation,\" he said. <br>\"I have an officer working on this as we speak. I would much rather have my officers concentrating on growth.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062d367c0e327c3f7c905d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T10:05:27.337Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's my colleague John Harris's take on the Lib Dem conference.

I thought it was because party conferences are increasingly dominated by lobbyists, rather than activists, but <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/danielfinkelstein/article3549498.ece\">in the Times today (paywall) Daniel Finkelstein suggests that there's a wider problem, which relates to the way politics is changing.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once these events in seaside towns were the gathering places of the representatives of vast movements. Parties had millions of members and were among the biggest voluntary associations in the country. When addressing the party faithful, a leader was addressing a real group, a significant group.</p> <p>But now? The mass party movements are no more. The membership has disappeared. And yet everyone keeps going as if it hasn\u2019t happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finkelstein suggests that annual conferences should be abandoned. Much as I like coming, I think he's onto something.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not assailing party members. It is fashionable to say they are swivel-eyed or doddery. Me, I\u2019ve always liked them. There\u2019s no part of their strange political obsession that I don\u2019t partake of fully myself. I\u2019ve had a lot to do with Tory party members and overwhelmingly found them kind, intelligent, engaged and committed to their communities. Other party memberships are no less so.</p> <p>But their politics are hardly representative. Not even of the core vote, let alone of swing voters. The biggest move in politics is from the committed to the uncommitted, from those with tribal attachments to those simply keeping score, choosing governments as if they were company managers. And the annual party conference season denies this trend, instead gathering together these unrepresentative people, encouraging them to confirm each other in their own beliefs and exerting pressure on governments and political leaderships to respond.</p> <p>The decline of mass political parties is hugely significant and almost certainly irreversible. And it\u2019s time for reform that reflects this reality. It is wrong, for instance, that what amount to little cliques should be choosing candidates for Parliament. But why not start by ending these annual conferences? A broader convention of supporters every three or four years, perhaps. That should be plenty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:46:31.526Z\">8.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has not been much evidence of plotting against Nick Clegg at the Lib Dem conference, but my colleague <strong>Patrick Kingsley</strong> was at the Liberal Left fringe meeting yesterday where he discovered that an attempted coup is underway. It's being masterminded by Lembit Opik! Here's what Patrick sent me.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Half of Liberal Democrats are dissatisfied with Nick Clegg, according to an activists' poll, but it's been hard to find barefaced dissent at conference. Last night's Liberal&#xa0;Left event was the exception \u2013 former MP Lembit Opik openly demanded that Clegg resign as leader, soliciting support for a petition that calls for Clegg to remain as&#xa0;deputy prime minister, but step away from the running of the party.</p> <p>\"The problem is that the image of the Liberal Democrats is mixed up with the coalition government,\" said Opik. Clegg is too tainted by his relationship with the Tories, he&#xa0;said: if he's not ousted by the next election, \"we'll be throttled to death.\"</p> <p>Currently, the Lib Dem conference cannot fire the Lib Dem leader. But should Opik's petition gather enough support, it would force a vote at the party's spring&#xa0;conference on whether to give delegates the power to sack Clegg. The proposal would need a two-thirds majority to pass.</p> <p>Opik wants Clegg to get on with the business of running the country, and let someone else try to remould the party's image. That someone, he argued, would ideally be&#xa0;a leftish backbencher who comes from the grass-roots. He wouldn't name names \u2013 but party president Tim Farron fits the bill.&#xa0;</p> <p>Opik was speaking at a fringe event hosted by Liberal Left, the party's most left-wing faction \u2013 and led by rebel MP Adrian Sanders, assembly member Stephen Knight,&#xa0;and Liberal Left chair Linda Jack.</p> <p>\"Where next for the Liberal Democrats?\" the panellists asked \u2013 and for many the answer was clear: away from Clegg.</p> <p>\"When your party leader starts to appear on your opponents' leaflets more often than your own,\" said Knight, \"you have to wonder whether or not he's an asset.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>More generally, there were concerns that the Lib Dems have swung too far to the right in recent years. \"There is a feeling that this is no longer our party,\" said Linda&#xa0;Jack, who tabled an amendment on Monday criticising the coalition's deficit plans, which was shot down by party honchos. A decade ago, she argued, social liberals&#xa0;like her were at the centre of the Liberal Democrats. But because so many left-wingers have since left, those who remain are now seen as extremists.</p> <p>Knight was particularly upset at a recent pamphlet on \"Cleggism\" written by Richard Reeves, Clegg's outgoing strategist. Reeves promoted the pamphlet at a think-tank&#xa0;event on Monday \u2013 arguing that the party should abandon their social democratic wing, and redefine themselves as purely big-L Liberal. Sanders said Reeves shouldn't&#xa0;be taken too seriously: his debate was mocked at a meeting of the parliamentary party on Monday. One MP, he said, noted that it was on at the same time as a&#xa0;discussion about assisted dying \u2013 and wondered whether the two events could have been merged.</p> <p>For his part, Sanders stayed clear of saying anything particularly inflammatory. But he suggested that Clegg was stuck in a bubble, and needed to employ more advisers&#xa0;with links to the grassroots.</p> <p>So if this was the revolution, it was a pretty small one. Only 20 people turned up, evidence that not everyone left in the party hankers after rebellion. Sanders said there&#xa0;were no machinations within parliament to depose Clegg, while Opik is a marginal figure, ridiculed for losing one of the Liberal Democrats' safest seats in 2010.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-27T10:03:21.626Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5062b11dc0e327c3f7c905bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:39:19.760Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's the final day of the Lib Dem conference and Nick Clegg will close the conference with a speech at 2.30pm. Some excerpts have already been released in advance, and The Times, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxyQqDik2rs\">remembering David Steel,</a> has summed up Clegg's message with a rather brilliant headline (paywall): <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3549685.ece\">\u201cGo back to your constituencies and prepare for vitriol and abuse.\u201d </a>Here's the quote from the Clegg speech setting it out in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that there are some in the party \u2013 some in this hall even \u2013 who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the Coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from Right and Left, as we work every day to keep this Government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Before Clegg speaks, we've also got a full programme of events this morning. Here's the full agenda.</p> <p><em>9am:</em> Debate on mental health</p> <p><em>9.45am:</em> Emergency debate on planning, on a motion saying the government should drop its plan to relax some planning laws for three years.</p> <p><em>10.35am:</em> Debate on housing.</p> <p><em>12.20pm:</em> Jo Swinson, the new consumer affairs minister, delivers a speech.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Nick Clegg's speech. As Patrick Wintour reports, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-speech\">Clegg will send an austere message to his party on Wednesday, telling them the Liberal Democrats are willing to impose several more years of spending restraint, are now anchored in the centre ground and are determined never to revert to being a party of protest and opposition.</a></p> <p>At some point this morning I'm also going to write a post on 10 things we've learnt from the Lib Dem conference (once I've worked out what they are).</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>Student journalism is not the most glamorous way to start your media career. You're often crammed into a small bunker with not enough chairs and no natural light. You'll spend hours slaving over your copy or touching up photographs when you should be writing essays.</p> <p>But endless deadlines and impassioned disagreements over typefaces create a sense of solidarity among young journalists. Most papers put on weekly socials so you can go drinking with your newsroom colleagues. When the big debates of the day inevitably spill out of the paper and into the pub, you'll end up making great friends.</p> <p>Plus there are perks. The student newspaper is a great way to meet your heroes. Nina Seale is a second year zoology student at the University of Edinburgh and the current science and environment editor of their paper, <a href=\"http://www.studentnewspaper.org/\" title=\"\">the Student</a>. She was fortunate enough to interview the primatologist Dame Jane Goodall. \"It was one of the highlights of my life,\" she says. \"She is at the top of the list of people I would ever want to meet in the world.\"</p> <p>There are also glitzy media balls like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/student-media-awards-2012\" title=\"\">Guardian Student Awards</a> at the end of year where you get to don your best frock and have famous people tell you how great you are.</p> <p>Working on the paper is also bound to improve your journalistic skills. If you're making regular contributions it will sharpen your writing tone, buff up your vocabulary and give you the confidence to write in any style \u2013 from a live blog of the latest arrivals at the local zoo to a principled polemic on world politics.</p> <p>However, it's a common misconception that all students who are involved with student media are dead set on a career in journalism. While this may be true in some cases, skills like working to a deadline and conducting an interview will prepare you for a range of career paths. Meeting new people, especially people you wouldn't normally come across, can be rewarding in itself.</p> <p>\"Basically I do it because it's fun,\" said Daniel Swain, comment editor for the Student and aspiring investment banker. \"It's like a job you can do on the weekend where you just get to hang out with your friends. It's something I'll never get the chance to do again when I have a real job.\"</p> <p>Plenty of established journos started out on their student rag \u2013 Bill Turnbull on BBC Breakfast is just one of the Student's famous former-editors. If you think it could be you reading the headlines, you should definitely give student journalism a chance.</p> <p>Being a student hack can be stressful, especially when writers drop out as deadline day inches closer and you're struggling to come up with a snappy headline. But for the most part it doesn't really feel like a job at all \u2013 even though it can make all the difference on your CV. When you come to the end of your university life, you'll hopefully have a ton of bylines and experience to take with you. But if all that doesn't tempt you, the prospect of a few new friends just might.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.strobegold.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bad_shirt.jpg\" title=\"\">There have been monstrosities in the past and there will be monstrosities in the future</a>. And, true, this season's Premier League home kits don't throw up any true horrors \u2013 the guano effect that sullied Liverpool's red shirts between 1989 and '91, the awful lace-up shirts Manchester United sported from 1992 to '94 \u2013 but that's about all to say in favour of this season's kits. The modern demand that kits must be changed every season in order to fleece money out of people who believe they must be up to date to support their team is ruining our kits. Tiny, incremental change every year means even the simplest kits are sporting silly fripperies. It doesn't matter if it looks good, so long as it is recognisably different from last year's effort. The result? This year's Premier League selection might be the most underwhelming ever, with more than half the clubs having ruined their home kits one way or another. Here is your club-by-club roll of shame.</p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/arsenal-s-new-home-kit-picture-gallery\" title=\"\">Arsenal</a></h2> <p>The problem: That tricolour on the sleeves. At first, I'd assumed it was to mark some Ars\u00e8ne Wenger-related anniversary but it turns out to be a \"blue hoop detail inspired by the home kit socks worn in the 1930s under legendary manager Herbert Chapman\". A shirt design inspired by 80-year-old socks? Which marketing man thought up that line, and how hard does he laugh when he hears someone repeat it? Sadly, given the simple beauty of their classic kit, Arsenal have an impressive recent history of screwing it up completely.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2812092,00.html\" title=\"\">Aston Villa</a></h2> <p>The problem: There doesn't appear to be a significant one. The body is claret, the sleeves are blue, the collar is simple. Shame the official photo shoot appears to have been undertaken as a hurricane rolled in over Villa Park, and the pictures are a bit dark to actually see the colours.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.football-shirts.co.uk/fans/chelsea-fc-adidas-home-shirt-201213_15104\" title=\"\">Chelsea</a></h2> <p>The problem: None. Obviously, it features cutting edge \"TechFit\" and \"Climacool\" technology (both trademarks, don't use those words lightly), but you know what \u2013 I think this is the nicest kit in the Premier League. The blue is pretty much solid (I couldn't see those diagonals on it from close-up at Loftus Road the other week), and the silver trim actually looks tasteful (though I was sure it was gold when I saw it being worn). The words I thought I would never say: well done, Chelsea.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.evertonfc.com/homekit201213\" title=\"\">Everton</a></h2> <p>The problem: What's with the huge white cuffs? It makes all the players look like they're bandaged after trying to kill themselves. Only they were stupid enough to slash their biceps rather than their wrists.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://epltalk.com/2012/07/13/fulham-home-shirt-for-2012-13-season-stripes-photo/\" title=\"\">Fulham</a></h2> <p>The problem: The pinstripes. Received Premier League wisdom holds that Fulham's crowd is entirely composed of tourists and City traders (a couple of years back, on a rare visit to Craven Cottage, I sat in front of a man earnestly explaining to a baffled American tourist that most British schools had a house system, where the boys \u2013 no girls go to school apparently \u2013 are grouped together under a housemaster. Both stereotypes in two seats). Putting pinstripes on your shirts \u2013 which should be plain white \u2013 will do nothing to change the perception of the Cottagers as the bankers' club.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.liverpoolfc.com/lfchomekit\" title=\"\">Liverpool</a></h2> <p>The problem: Like all men of a certain age, I believe Liverpool kits should be made by Umbro. But other than the kit manufacturer, I can see very little wrong with this. It may indeed prove to be the most successful thing at Anfield this season.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://shop.mcfc.co.uk/stores/mancity/products/kit_selector.aspx?selectorid=358\" title=\"\">Manchester City</a></h2> <p>The problem: Sky blue is notoriously easy to get wrong. So congratulations to City on getting it right. It wasn't always this way: few who were present will ever forget the first Kappa kit launched by City, in 1997, when the assembled journalists barely got to see the new shirt because most of the club's stock had been pinched from a parked van the night before. The highlight of the event was the horror on the face of Kappa's president as he stood next to the retired referee Neil Midgley, who was acting as MC: \"We're like the Everly Brothers! One of us drinks Everly, and one of us smokes Everly!\" You wouldn't get that at the Etihad.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Kit-Launch/NewsListing/2012/May/manchester-united-unveil-new-gingham-inspired-2012-13-home-kit.aspx\" title=\"\">Manchester United</a></h2> <p>The problem: It's \"a design inspired by the club's rich history and close bond with the heritage of Manchester. This relationship is represented by the striking gingham print which runs through the shirt \u2013 a tribute to the world-famous fabric that powered Manchester's growth from a small market town to a global centre of cotton textiles. Its iconic checked pattern remains an enduring symbol of the city's culture today.\" No, it's tartan and it looks ridiculous. Still, United pioneered the shameless-bastardisation-in-the-name-of-history. Why stop now?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.soccer-blogger.com/2012/07/13/newcastle-home-kit-201213-pumas-newcastle-home-shirt-for-1213/\" title=\"\">Newcastle United</a></h2> <p>The problem: Too much white. Black and white stripes are hard to get right, despite being so simple. Last season, Newcastle got it badly wrong \u2013 black shirts with a couple of white stripes on the front. This season's is better, but all the white trim makes it look like a Juventus shirt. Proper stripes, black trim, and they'll be sorted.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.footballshirtculture.com/12/13-kits/norwich-city-2012-2013-errea-home-football-kit.html\" title=\"\">Norwich City</a></h2> <p>The problem: None. I can't say it's my preferred colour combination but it's what Norwich play in and Errea has managed not to cover the Canaries' shirts with vile additions. Shame about the black away kit, mind.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://footballfashion.org/wordpress/2012/07/28/queens-park-rangers-lotto-201213-home-away-and-third-kits/\" title=\"\">QPR</a></h2> <p>The problem: QPR are meant to look like a football team in blue and white hoops, not a collection of Breton fishermen who've somehow wandered into west London. Last season's kit was criticised by fans for having too many blue hoops and making them too thin. The club responded by adding an extra hoop and making them even thinner \u2013 and still Tony Fernandes has a reputation as a listening chairman. All hopes are now pinned on the expiry of the kit deal with Lotto, and the expectation that no one could mangle the kit any more than has been done already.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.readingfcdirect.co.uk/retproddetail.aspx?d=23&amp;id=886\" title=\"\">Reading</a></h2> <p>The problem: From too many hoops to too few. There must be a happy medium somewhere along the M4 corridor. Perhaps the optimum number of hoops is to be found midway between QPR and Reading, in Slough. Kit designers worldwide are setting out for the town as you read this, in the hope of finding out.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.footballshirtculture.com/12/13-kits/southampton-2012-2013-umbro-home-a-away-football-shirts.html\" title=\"\">Southampton</a></h2> <p>The problem: In this case, <a href=\"http://www.caughtoffside.com/2012/06/30/southampton-launch-new-201213-home-away-kits/\" title=\"\">let me cede the floor to a commenter on the caughtoffside website</a>: \"The worst home kit EVER. Won't be buying the shirt. After the sash and the return to stripes, I thought SFC cared about the supporters. Obviously I'm wrong. What an absolute insult. CRAP.\" Quite right, Pete Jordan. Southampton play in stripes, they do not play in red with white pinstripes. And what is it with pinstripes this season, eh? Apparently, in the case of the Saints, the shirt \"sets itself apart from recent designs to embrace the new era of Premier League football for the club\". Am I imagining the striped shirts they used to wear in the Premier League, then?</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.scfcdirect.com/retproddetail.aspx?d=75&amp;id=4464\" title=\"\">Stoke City</a></h2> <p>The problem: The only problem is the way the team plays, isn't it? The kit's great \u2013 a close challenger to Chelsea for best kit of the season \u2013 suggesting Adidas are the only one of the big kit-makers who understand that fans want kits that look more or less how you would describe your club's basic colours to someone who'd never seen them.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.soccer-blogger.com/2012/07/18/new-sunderland-home-kit-201213-adidas-reveal-safcs-new-2012-2013-season-home-strip/\" title=\"\">Sunderland</a></h2> <p>The problem: None. Again Adidas take on a traditional design and do nothing horrific to it. They obviously need a management shake-up over there.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://whatculture.com/sport/swanseas-new-home-kit-revealed-for-201213.php\" title=\"\">Swansea City</a></h2> <p>The problem: In a word \u2013 hubris. By all means take a pure white kit and add lettering and trim in gold. But make sure you have a trophy cabinet like Real Madrid before you do so. Getting tonked in a kit covered with gold \u2013 the colour of champions, not 100th anniversaries \u2013 is not a good look, even when the shirt itself is a thing of beauty.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2172529/Tottenham-unveil-new-white-2012-13-home-kit.html\" title=\"\">Tottenham Hotspur</a></h2> <p>The problem: The shorts. Why can't Tottenham leave their shorts alone? Last season's looked black \u2013 though Spurs friends assured me they were \"midnight blue\" \u2013 and this year they're white. There always used to be nonsense about Spurs and Chinese mythology; how they'd be successful in the Chinese year of the cockerel. But given the club's infrequent habit of donning white shorts \u2013 from 1985-87, in 2007-08, and now \u2013 which used to be reserved for European games, it seems they take more notice of the Chinese year of the idiot designer. On the bright side, the shirt doesn't have those yellow wee stains like the one from 2009-10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/west-bromwich-albion-fc/west-bromwich-albion-fc-news/2012/06/15/west-bromwich-albion-unveil-new-adidas-kit-for-2012-13-season-97319-31190319\" title=\"\">West Bromwich Albion</a></h2> <p>The problem: None. It's got stripes and it's made by Adidas. That's your seal of non-embarrassment, right there.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.soccer-blogger.com/2012/06/29/west-ham-home-kit-2012-13-macron-unveil-new-whufc-home-shirt-20122013/\" title=\"\">West Ham United</a></h2> <p>The problem: I prefer Villa's collar but there's not a lot wrong with this. Perhaps Macron are already preparing for the day when fans at the Olympic Stadium will be too far from the pitch to actually pick out anything bar the basic colours of the shirt.</p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.laticsshop.net/201213-adult-home\" title=\"\">Wigan Athletic</a></h2> <p>The problem: You can't see it in the picture, but it's the back \u2013 it's solid blue. Like Newcastle's last season this is not a striped shirt but a solid one with two white patched. Then again, how many people outside Wigan actually have strong feelings about a Wigan shirt?</p>",

  "<p>Residents, businesses and emergency services in North Yorkshire were nervously watching river levels on Thursday as the after-effects of days of rain continued to threaten hundreds of properties.</p> <p>Parts of York were underwater and flats on higher ground were cut off as the river Ouse through the city continued to rise, prompting fears that flood defences protecting other areas might be breached when flows peaked about mid-morning.</p> <p>Fire and rescue services said the flooding was already the worst in the city for 10 years.</p> <p>Nearly 60 flood warnings in England, Wales and the Scottish borders remained in force after some areas suffered more than twice the normal monthly rainfall since Sunday.

  "<p>\"How do we fix this mess?\" That may be one of the stupidest questions I have ever asked myself, as of course I don't know the answer. What I do know, however, is that few of the structural flaws in how the global economy operates, which took us from unsustainable boom to intractable bust, have been fixed. And that leads me to fear that in the rich west, and perhaps more widely, it will be many years yet before we enjoy the kind of recovery that raises most people's living standards.</p> <p>Here are just a few of the surreal characteristics of the worldwide financial and economic system that is our lot.</p> <p>We have global regulations for banks that incentivise them to make it impossible for ordinary mortals \u2013 including their owners, regulators and even their own directors \u2013 to know with confidence the risks they are running. And at the same time these rules encourage senior bank executives to run their respective operations in a way that maximises the short-term profits they make \u2013 and of course their pay and bonuses \u2013 subject to those regulations, rather than simply concentrating on providing the credit and services of most use to their customers.</p> <p>I am referring to the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords\" title=\"\">Basel</a> rules, set by a largely unaccountable priesthood of regulators and central bankers who meet in camera in a sleepy Swiss town and have determined how banks protect themselves against shocks since the 1980s. Think of these money priests as the financial equivalents of the members of Fifa's governing body or the International Olympic Committee \u2013 which is not to suggest that there has ever been a hint of corruption at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Committee_on_Banking_Supervision\" title=\"\">Basel committee on banking supervision</a>, but is to say that transparency and openness are not the strongest suits of a committee whose recommendations have a powerful bearing on all our livelihoods.</p> <p>The Basel rules were originally designed to ensure that all big banks anywhere in the world retained a minimum amount of capital relative to their loans and investments, to absorb losses when it all goes wrong. In other words, they were supposed to make the banking system safer and to create a level playing field between banks. In practice, and almost from the start, the rules were written in such a complicated way that they created a virtual licence for clever bankers and their respective banks to cheat. And the devastating consequence is that they actually allowed banks to become both dangerously enormous and to hold less capital relative to their loans than at any point in history, although you could not see how weak banks had become because of the eccentric way that the rules calculate capital and risk.</p> <p>Here is what should perhaps worry us all. Although banks are being forced to hold more capital (a good thing), the Basel rules have become even more complicated, creating even greater incentives for banks to cheat. So for me, one of the great mysteries of the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/07/credit-crunch-boom-bust-timeline\" title=\"\">2008 financial crisis</a>, which was a big cause of our current malaise, is why the Basel rulebook was not torn up and replaced with something a lot simpler. Arguably, it would have been much more sensible to give banks more freedom to manage their operations in a commercial way, subject to simpler stipulations that would place stricter limits on how much banks can lend relative to their capital, and how much cash they have to hold as protection against runs.</p> <p>To return to the analogy with sport, we all know that the simpler and clearer are the rules of any game, the easier it is to prevent cheating. Unfortunately, this is not a lesson that the global financial priesthood seems keen to learn.</p> <p>So what else about the wonky way the world generates wealth is still in need of reform? Well it might be an idea for there to be a less sharp distinction between the consuming and borrowing countries on the one hand \u2013 that's the UK, the US and the shakier parts of the eurozone \u2013 and the producing and lending countries, such as China and Germany. To put it in slightly simplistic and emotive terms, it is surely barking mad that Chinese workers toil every hour of the day to make stuff for us, which we buy with credit that to an extent China has provided to us.</p> <p>The way I see the crash of 2008 is the moment when the penny dropped that a number of economies \u2013 and the UK was in the frontline of these \u2013 had borrowed more than they could afford to repay. I am talking here about aggregated debt, or the sum of what consumers, companies, banks and government owe. Since that painful awakening, we have not started to pay down the debt in any meaningful way. Instead we have shuffled it, so that government debt has increased as a direct consequence of largeish repayments by banks and modest repayments by consumers. But until the sum of all that debt starts to fall, economies such as ours and America's and much of the eurozone will continue to be on fragile foundations.</p> <p>Which brings me to an elephant that has been in the room in which prime ministers and business leaders swank and swagger for 20 years \u2013 namely that globalisation is real and (ahem) global, but government is national. Or to put it another way, the flaws in globalisation cannot and will not be tackled effectively unless and until there are much better mechanisms for politicians and people to hold in check global capital and global businesses. But if even a region with a large degree of shared history, such as the eurozone, is struggling to centralise political decision-making, it may be naive to hope that the US and Chinese presidents will one day come to think of themselves as playing for the same team, in collective efforts to limit the tendency of globalisation to lurch from crisis to crisis.</p> <p>Or to put it another way, the most I hope to achieve with my new book, \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Fix-This-Mess-Prosperity/dp/1444757091\" title=\"\">How Do We Fix This Mess</a>\", is that a brighter light is shone on what has gone wrong with global finance and the global economy, in the hope that \u2013 at perhaps a snail's pace \u2013 we may one day mend some of it.</p>",

  "<p>A relatively common misconception of local government is that the main thing we do is pick up the bins. This isn't surprising \u2013 it's an important service and the most visible we provide.</p> <p>Yet there are literally hundreds of other ways councils serve local communities, from the fun and entertaining such as libraries and leisure centres, to the essential services that most residents fortunately never encounter, such as safeguarding children. Some local authorities deliver more than 700 services to their communities.</p> <p>The hard-working council employees I encounter are generally content to go about their work in an unostentatious way. It isn't in the nature of public service to shout about what you do. But occasionally it pays to pipe up \u2013 and today, the #OurDay tweetathon offers an ideal opportunity.</p> <p>Over a 24-hour period we're asking local authorities, councillors and council workers to take a couple of minutes to give residents an insight into a day in the life of local government, describing what they are doing and why.</p> <p>The benefits of participating are twofold. Firstly, it gives councils the opportunity to show residents they offer a round the clock service to communities. From the pre-dawn street cleaning teams to environment officers handling late night calls from neighbours kept awake by noisy house parties, councils are working 24 hours a day. Using Twitter, it only takes a couple of minutes to let residents know how their money is being spent and alert them to the services that are available to them.</p> <p>Secondly, it helps to publicise councils' new communication channels. The growth in social media and the number of web-savvy residents using smartphones has gifted local authorities a cheap and easy way of talking with the people they serve. From updates on road closures and black ice warnings, to advising residents of the opportunities to respond to community consultations, online networks offer a great way to get information out quickly and directly. And it gives residents the opportunity to provide instant feedback.</p> <p>Traditional media outlets, including radio stations and local papers, remain an important way to share ideas, but remember that many of the 18-year-olds who voted in the most recent local elections have had access to the internet since they were eight years old. It is essential that our approach evolves with them and the older residents who have also embraced social media. Part of that means reaching out and explaining why they should follow and join our social media outlets.</p> <p>I'll be tweeting about my day today from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmontfort\" title=\"\">@dmontfort</a> and I hope you'll follow me and join in with #OurDay.

  "<p>What is the modern Conservative party? How coherent is its ideology? Is it united? Not in the sense of the day-to-day policy skirmishes around David Cameron, but rather at the party's deeper levels, the real potential source of prime ministerial instability.</p> <p>The central paradox facing the modern Tory party is obvious. On the one hand, Cameron carries it all pretty lightly; he enjoys, and is pretty good at, the job. He purports to lead a modern, liberal, cosmopolitan government \u2013 all mainstream politicians now tend to call themselves \"progressive\". He presides over a radical, reforming administration \u2013 think deficit reduction, health reform and the overhaul of welfare \u2013 and faces an opposition recovering from arguably its worst ever election defeat. Not a bad place to be. All other things being equal, the party should be united behind the leader.</p> <p>Yet the hallmark of the modern Tory party is fragility. It is a dangerously brittle thing. After 13 long years of opposition, and barely two years into government, it appears to be sinking, devoid of pragmatism. The recent reshuffle exposed its inner wiring \u2013 a medium-term modernisation strategy surrendered before the concerns of day-to-day party management. Cameron is captive and weak. Boris is mean and hungry. New right-wing factions are launched almost weekly. Hostility to the Liberal Democrats is simple transference; real venom is directed in private at the Tory leader. Is there any better example of a new government stalling so dramatically after initial suggestions of energy and vitality?</p> <p>The leadership response from Westminster is to paper over the cracks \u2013 to remind us these are the usual mid-term travails ramped up by sacked or passed-over MPs and the pathologically oppositional. Meanwhile, from the grassroots, the admirable <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/tim_montgomerie/\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie of the influential website Conservative Home</a> calls for renewed vigour on the part of Osborne, Hague and IDS in drilling into Ed Miliband's leadership, and a focus on immigration and welfare. Both sides look to the impressive 2010 intake to square the circle; to import grit, ideas and rigour into the Tories, and to deal with the pesky Lib Dems.</p> <p>All roads lead to <em>Britannia Unchained</em>, the short tract written by a group of young, right-wing Tory MPs that is considered a route map to political renewal. Forget the small beer, shallow-end stuff of the news cycle: real unity is to be secured through rallying to the ideas in this book, and its generation of Tory \"stars\" putting a spark into their party and securing outright victory in 2015. That is quite a task for the MP authors Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss, yet they appear up for it. The book received some unfavourable attention before it was published \u2013 newspapers picked up on the suggestion that the British people are \"among the worst idlers in the world\", too many of whom \"prefer a lie-in to hard work\". But first things first: there is still much here that we can agree on.</p> <p>The task at hand is to rebuild this country. We start with an extraordinary economic history, but one we cannot simply rest on. The reality is that Britain does, as these authors suggest, face a fundamental choice \u2013 whether to manage decline or confront today's global challenges. How can we do this and build a successful 2020 Britain? Many of the remedies put forward here are pretty self evident: good quality childcare, applauding hard work, high quality education and skill formation, embracing risk and innovation, regional balance, cutting unnecessary red tape. The comparisons the authors make are also of interest \u2013 praise is given not just to the usual Singapore and South Korea, but also to Brazil and even parts of Europe. The authors demonstrate their socially liberal credentials on race, sexuality, gender and identity, and they make other interesting arguments: for example, they question the cult of celebrity, and emphasise the importance of virtuous parenting and the nurturing of appropriate attitudes in our children.</p> <p>Yet at its core this book is not about social liberalism. Scratch off the veneer and all is revealed: a destructive economic liberalism that threatens the foundations of modern conservatism. The state is assumed always to be malign, and it's taken for granted that the labour market is not flexible enough (is it ever?). For reform read marketisation and intensified commodification. In this world, safety nets stifle a \"can-do\" culture, weakening our work ethic and muscular individuality. Banking crises are simply part of the natural order of things; Britons are working fewer hours because they can't be bothered or are wilfully avoiding work. The role of politics and public policy and the impact of structural problems in markets and institutions are absent from the analysis.</p> <p>For these authors \u2013 all members of the party's right-leaning Free Enterprise Group \u2013 it is a binary world, where everything is forward or back, progress or decline, sink or swim, good or bad. They do not appear to see the world as a complex place. The choice is between regulation and dynamism: their ideal worker is one prepared to work long hours, commute long distances and expect no employment protection and low pay. Their solution to the problem of childcare is unregulated, \"informal and cheap childminders\". We need dramatic cuts in public expenditure, they argue, to be matched by equivalent tax cuts. The demonisation of the welfare recipient continues apace; a broad dystopian worldview dominates the future. The bottom line for these Tory radicals is that the notion of community, society or indeed country is always trumped by textbook economic liberalism.</p> <p>A few years ago I asked a high-flying commentator about the notion of \"compassionate conservatism\". This young columnist is hardwired into the project set out in <em>Britannia Unchained</em> and gives his readers a weekly report from the frontline. His contempt for the compassionate version of Tory ideology was total. Why, I asked. Because \"we\" are \"liberals organising within the Conservative party,\" he replied. It is this economic liberalism that has sought, albeit in vain, to sell off our forests. It seeks a planning free-for-all; it celebrates chaos. It would dismantle valued national institutions \u2013 in broadcasting, policing, transport and health. Such libertarianism is unpatriotic \u2013 the nation's best interests wouldn't be pursued in industrial strategy, defence or indeed Britain's place within Europe. It threatens the \"national-popular\" foundations of the Thatcher revolution; it is a brutal and destructive creed at odds with national interest as she understood it.</p> <p>Put simply, Margaret Thatcher knew she had to meld together the economic liberalism of the new right and the traditional, patriotic sentiment of both her party and the country. This was never framed as \"either-or\". Her pragmatic brilliance built a coalition that contested the centre ground and bolted in parts of the working class.</p> <p>In contrast, although claiming to be the true descendants of Mrs T, the authors of <em>Britannia Unchained</em> represent a project that is extreme and destructive, and which threatens the essential character of our nation. It is because this faction is in the ascendancy that Cameron is actually failing; he remains captive to an economic reductionism that could well destroy conservatism \u2013 in the proper sense of valuing and conserving the nature and assorted institutions of the country.</p> <p>Cameron is not one of this crew. Tactically, in the short term he might survive; but in the medium term he is toast. The economic liberals' march through the Conservative party will continue; every day there is less and less opposition, and they will eventually win. The coalition with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Book:_Reclaiming_Liberalism\" title=\"\">Orange Book Liberals</a> in Clegg's party might well stumble on. But the cost, over time, will be two lost traditions: a recognisable conservatism and a recognisable social liberalism.</p> <p>\u2022 Jon Cruddas MP is a member of the shadow cabinet and leads Labour's policy review.</p>",
  "<p>Exposure to new cultures, broadening horizons and different ways of learning \u2013 the benefits of international collaboration have made it a valuable part of many school repertoires. And what works for mainstream pupils is often equally applicable for children with special needs, as a growing number of special schools and special needs co-ordinators in mainstream schools are discovering.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sackville.w-sussex.sch.uk/\">Sackville School</a>, a mainstream school in East Grinstead, West Sussex, has a long-standing partnership with a Finnish school, which has so far taken a variety of forms, from video conferencing to staff exchanges. In one project, Sackville pupils sent a toy bear to Finland, which was then photographed by Finnish students in a number of locations, the pictures then assembled into a photo-story complete with captions.</p> <p>The combination of IT skills and storytelling that the project needed proved a winning one for the year 9 boys involved, according to Anne Jakins, Sackville's special needs co-ordinator. Writing captions that could be understood by their Finnish counterparts forced them to take extra care over their work, making sure they used simple sentences and avoid idiom.</p> <p>\"Often boys with special needs have difficulties with literacy but their IT skills are good, so this was a really good way of engaging them,\" she says. \"They know their work is going to be read by a specific audience and that makes learning real.\"</p> <p>Video conferencing gave the Sackville pupils the opportunity to practise asking questions and listening, and using this method with slightly older pupils also gave rise to another idea. \"They realised the thing they had in common was they would soon be leaving school, so we did a project on interviewing skills and non-verbal communication, to show all the body language you use in an interview,\" Ms Jakins adds.</p> <p>\"It gives them a different kind of focus. They become more self-aware and because it is unusual they make more effort. They realise they're representing their school.\"</p> <p>Many international projects are brokered by the <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/\">British Council</a>, which runs a number of programmes linking schools around the globe. It was through the British Council's <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/comenius.htm\">Comenius</a> project that <a href=\"http://www.torbankschool.org.uk/\">Tor Bank School</a>, in Dundonald, Northern Ireland, twinned with schools in Gran Canaria and Holland.</p> <p>Colm Davis, head teacher at Tor Bank, a school for children with severe learning disabilities, says a particular focus of the partnership has been looking at teaching and learning for pupils with autism.</p> <p>For Tor Bank and its partner schools, their relationship revolves around staff exchanges, with almost a quarter of the staff at the Northern Ireland school involved, including teachers, classroom assistants and speech and language therapists.</p> <p>\"It gives us the opportunity to look at what happens in other countries and to benchmark ourselves,\" Davis says. \"We are also able to look at new ideas.\"</p> <p>One of these has been sensory approaches to teaching children with autism, such as the use of dog therapy, encouraging children to talk to and care for a dog, at the Gran Canaria school. Although Davis admits he was sceptical at first, when he saw how it worked in practice he decided to try it out for himself.</p> <p>\"We ended up bringing a dog in for the whole of last year and it went down very well with our children with autism,\" he adds.</p> <p>While Tor Bank's international links stretch back several years, Milton School in Glasgow is at the beginning of the process. Head teacher Bernadette Casey says their initial aim is to help pupils become aware of their immediate environment, and gradually expand their horizons.</p> <p>\"Our young people have such complex learning needs that our staff were a bit hesitant at first,\" she says. \"If they don't have a sense of their own self and their own place, it is hard to start doing international education with them.\"</p> <p>Beginning this term, so far the project has seen pupils explore Glasgow and link up with an English school. Although it is very much in its early stages, already teachers are starting to see the benefits. While the pupils are developing the skills involved in getting the bus and visiting museums and then sharing those experiences, staff are reaping the rewards in their own practice.</p> <p>\"It is easy to be quite introverted but this is opening up new doors and showing there is a big world out there,\" Casey says. \"The young people are responding really well and they're more engaged and interested, and it is also really good for the teachers. It has given them a good focus and it has also motivated our support staff.\"</p> <p>On the back of these early successes, Milton is now putting together an application for partnership with other European schools through the British Council. Its English partner, <a href=\"http://www.lakeside.herts.sch.uk/\">Lakeside School</a> in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, is already twinned with schools in the Czech Republic and Belgium.</p> <p>Joint projects so far include exchanging sensory stories, used with children with profound learning difficulties. Lakeside teachers have also picked up tips on the use of technology from their counterparts in Belgium, and on iPad apps suitable for use with SEN pupils.</p> <p>\"Some of our more able students have also been using Skype and interacting on a basic level,\" adds Tanis Lang, teacher and international co-ordinator at Lakeside. \"A lot of our students can't travel abroad so this gives them a much greater understanding of the world.\"</p> <p>The link has enabled Lakeside teachers to see Canis therapy in action in the Czech school. The technique, mostly used with children who do not walk, involves a specially trained dog lying underneath their head or limbs for half an hour at a time. The child feels the warmth from the dog, with the effects said to last between two and four times as long as conventional physiotherapy. Although not yet used at Lakeside, it has encouraged the school in its use of dogs in the classroom to improve communication.</p> <p>As well as brushing up their ICT skills, Lakeside staff have the opportunity to take part in exchange visits. One member of staff spent two weeks in Belgium sharing expertise in intensive interaction, a method of teaching communication skills to children with autism or severe learning difficulties, while two teaching assistants have applied for work shadowing placements, with visually impaired children in Germany and at a unit for autistic children in the Czech Republic.</p> <p>\"At first it was very much the teachers but now it has opened up to the whole of the staff,\" says Land. \"For staff these kinds of links are an excellent form of development.\"</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>As presidents and prime ministers gather in New York at the UN General Assembly, secretary general Ban Ki-moon has launched an unprecedented special initiative called Education First. This is driven by Ban's own personal experience: education transformed both his own life and the fortunes of his country, Korea. The aim of the initiative is to galvanise new action on education, getting all children into school, improving the quality of learning and fostering global citizenship. Powerful messages, bold communications, stark statistics and strong arguments have been put forward in support of the scheme. But is that enough?</p> <p>Certainly, there is much to be welcomed in placing education squarely on the agenda of heads of state. Too often, debates on education become technocratic \u2013 a refuge for specialists and experts \u2013 and the big picture is lost. Education can and should be the most powerful equalising force in a country, and so the direction of education reforms should be open to inclusive democratic dialogue. But key decisions tend to be taken behind closed doors in ministries of education without public awareness, let alone open consultation.</p> <p>In low-income countries, the direction of education reforms is often set by ministry officials in discussions with donor agencies such as the World Bank \u2013 and without the systematic involvement of national citizens and civil society organisations. This limits the ownership and appropriateness of policies that emerge and the feasibility of their implementation. Higher-level political involvement and more vigorous parliamentary and media debate on education is urgently needed.</p> <p>In this context, any high-level renewal of international attention to education is welcomed. But the key challenge is to translate this into sustained changes at national and local levels. Education requires strategic, long-term investments and only delivers returns after many years, so we need to ensure the new initiative moves beyond short-term headline-grabbing into practical, long-term action.</p> <p>Ban's initiative is refreshing for its recognition of the role of teachers \u2013 drawing attention to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2011/oct/07/un-estimate-teachers-shortage-worldwide\" title=\"\">need to create 2m new teaching positions</a>, reprioritise training and professional development, and redignify the profession. This should be obvious, but it is astounding how many international education policy debates fail to focus on teachers.</p> <p>In recent times, much attention has been given to measuring and assessing learning outcomes. In contrast, this initiative could help us to focus on actually improving learning outcomes. But to do this against a backdrop of decades of under-investment in teachers, Education First needs to be unequivocal in putting high-quality teachers at the top of its agenda. Again there is no quick-fix or low-cost solution. This requires a long-term commitment \u2013 to ensure that there are more teachers who are better trained and better supported.</p> <p>Ban's vision is expansive and positive. He is calling for education that is transformative, that is relevant in an inter-dependent and ever-changing world and that can help to build a more just, tolerant and peaceful future.</p> <p>But to achieve this vision of vibrant global citizenship, Education First will have to promote and protect active citizenship within the process from the start. This needs to be guaranteed at every level, involving civil society organisations more systematically than they have been to date. It means Education First using its high-level leverage to actively promote a new era of open, public dialogue on education at national level. It means championing the involvement of teachers, parents and students themselves in decision-making at school level. The secretary general could helpfully add his voice more strongly to the call for democratisation and active citizenship within education decision-making.</p> <p>In the past 10 years, more than 100 national education coalitions have sprung up around the world \u2013 linking teacher unions, NGOs, faith-based groups, social movements and others who are concerned to put education higher up their domestic political agenda. Linked together through the <a href=\"http://www.campaignforeducation.org\" title=\"\">Global Campaign for Education</a>, these coalitions have a crucial role to play in translating the vision of Education First into tangible change for communities, schools and children. These coalitions and campaigns thrive on clear targets and benchmarks against which they can hold their government and other actors to account.</p> <p>But in the initial documentation of Education First, there is no commitment to specific financial targets, despite growing consensus on what these should be (such as 20% of national budgets, 6% of a country's GDP, or at least 10% of donor aid budgets). On average, most donors now spend only 4% of their aid on basic education, and most of that money supports short-term projects rather than providing the predictable support needed for governments to invest in more trained teachers. Delivering on these financing targets and supporting inclusive decision-making processes in education need to be seen as the real tests of whether the UN, governments and donors are truly putting education first into practice.</p>",
  "<p>The first traces of plastic debris have been found in what was thought to be the pristine environment of the Southern Ocean, according to a study released in London by the French scientific research vessel Tara.</p> <p>The finding comes following a two-and-a-half-year, 70,000-mile voyage by the schooner across the Atlantic, Pacific, Antarctic and Indian Oceans, to investigate marine ecosystems and biodiversity under climate change.</p> <p>\"We had always assumed that this was a pristine environment, very little touched by human beings,\" said Chris Bowler, scientific co-ordinator of Tara Oceans. \"The fact that we found these plastics is a sign that the reach of human beings is truly planetary in scale.\"</p> <p>Samples taken from four different stations at locations in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica revealed traces of plastic at a measure of approximately 50,000 fragments per square kilometre \u2014 a rate comparable to the global average. While traces of plastic pollutants are customary in many of the world's oceans, with the highest levels found in the North Atlantic and North Sea, researchers had anticipated rates in the Southern Ocean to be some 10 times lower than the global average.</p> <p>\"Discovering plastic at these very high levels was completely unexpected because the Southern Ocean is relatively separated from the world's other oceans and does not normally mix with them,\" Bowler explained before unveiling Tara's findings at an event at the Science Museum in London on Wednesday. The microscopic fragments, invisible until accumulated in trawling nets, are the result of waste products such as plastic bags and bottles, degraded over years or decades by UV light and sea water. Tara researchers, whose work was recently hailed by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, were also surprised to find that synthetic fibres, largely constituted by clothing from washing-machine residue, made up a significant portion of the plastic fragments.</p> <p>Identifying the regional source of such general waste, which has made its way to the Southern Ocean over some half a century, remains more problematic. However, it is believed to originate from Africa, South America or Australia.</p> <p>The fatal impact of plastic pollutants on the marine environment has been widely observed, as birds and fish regularly consume waste products, which can be easily mistaken for jellyfish or other prey but cannot be degraded in the stomach. Plastics also slowly release toxins and other chemical substances that work their way up the marine food chain.</p> <p>\"It's too late to do much about what's already out there at this stage, as this stuff is going to hang around for thousands of years,\" said Bowler. However, he says the best way to mitigate future pollution is to advocate the use of biodegradable technologies while emphasising a shift in consumer practices.</p> <p>Tara will continue its marine research activities in 2013 with a groundbreaking mission to the Arctic circle to investigate the ocean environment following the melting of Arctic ice as a result of climate change.</p>"
