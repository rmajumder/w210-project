  "<p>Spending on conservation projects must rise by \"an order of magnitude\" if governments are to meet their pledges to manage protected areas and halt the spectacular rate of extinctions caused by human activity.</p> <p>A stark assessment from an international collaboration of conservation groups and universities reveals the enormous shortfall in funds required to save species, and warns that costs are likely to increase, the longer action is delayed.</p> <p>To reduce the risk of extinction for all threatened species would cost up to $4.76bn (\u00a32.97bn) every year, they say, with a further $76.1bn (\u00a347.4bn) required annually to establish and manage protected areas for species known to be at risk from habitat loss, hunting and other human activities.</p> <p>Though governments agreed in 2010 through the <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/\" title=\"Convention on Biological Diversity\">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> (CBD) to reduce the rate of human-induced extinctions and to improve protected areas by 2020, progress has been limited, in part because the financial costs of different strategies have been unclear.</p> <p>\"These seem enormous figures to us as individuals, but in terms of government budgets they are trivial,\" said Stuart Butchart, the global research co-ordinator at <a href=\"http://www.birdlife.org/\" title=\"BirdLife International\">BirdLife International</a> in Cambridge.</p> <p>\"The $3-5bn to improve the status of threatened species and prevent extinctions is less than the amount that the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier is over budget. And the cost for both species and site targets is less than half the amount spent on bankers' bonuses last year.\"</p> <p>The costings will feed into the meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/doc/?meeting=COP-11\" title=\"\">CBD under way in Hyderabad, India</a>. Writing in the journal <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science/1229803\" title=\"Financial costs of meeting two global biodiversity conservation targets: current spending and unmet needs\">Science</a>, the authors warn that resolving the conservation funding crisis is urgent. One challenge those attending the CBD meeting must address is the disparity in resources available for conservation in richer countries and the greater potential for conserving species in poorer, more biodiverse countries.</p> <p>The costs to save individual species vary as widely as the strategies required. The ground-nesting raso lark is found on only one of the Cape Verde islands, and conservationists hope to reintroduce it to a neighbouring island. Before that, a population of cats introduced by humans must be exterminated. \"They would probably wipe out any birds that you put there,\" said Butchart.</p> <p>In the US, the Californian condor used to range across the country, but no longer. One threat to the birds is the lead shot used by hunters in the wild. The birds are scavengers and can suffer if they ingest lead from animal carcasses.</p> <p>Efforts to protect rhino populations have focused on controlling poaching, guarding their habitats and providing suitable grasslands. In the Mediterranean, a programme of captive breeding and reintroduction has improved the lot of the Mallorcan midwife toad.</p> <p>For their analysis, the authors gathered details on the conservation of 211 globally threatened bird species and the costs to improve their status by one category on the red list of threatened species, maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/\" title=\"IUCN red list\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. For example, a species ranked as endangered might be reclassified as merely vulnerable after a successful conservation project. The researchers devised a model that then extrapolated the costs of conservation to all threatened bird species.</p> <p>Drawing on other conservation data for threatened mammals, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates and plants, the scientists arrived at a model that could predict the costs for all threatened species.</p> <p>In parallel, the team gathered information on the costs of protected areas for bird life and from these worked out how the cost would rise to establish and maintain safe havens for all threatened species.</p> <p>\"These aren't bills, they are investments in natural capital, because they are dwarfed by the benefits we get back from nature, the ecosystem services, such as pollination of crops, regulation of climate, and the provision of clean water,\" said Butchart.</p> <p>\"Governments have found vast sums to prop up the financial infrastructure of the world. It's even more vital to keep our natural infrastructure from failing,\" he added.</p>",
  "<p>Lance Armstrong could end up in court facing allegations of perjury and an attempt to reclaim millions of dollars of bonus money if a Texas-based insurance company decides to try to win back a payment to the disgraced cyclist that was made for winning the 2004 Tour de France.</p> <p>SCA Promotions had promised to pay Armstrong $5m in bonus money if he managed five consecutive Tour de France wins, but refused to do so amid widespread media rumours of doping. Armstrong took the company to arbitration, where he received a settlement of $7.5m, made up of the original bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees.</p> <p>In the wake of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/10/lance-armstrong-team-doping\">a damning report accusing Armstrong of being at the centre of \"sport's most sophisticated, professionalised and successful\" doping programme</a>, there is every prospect that the issue will be legally revisited, perhaps including charges of perjury if Armstrong can be shown to have lied during testimony first time around.</p> <p>Jeff Dorough, a lawyer for SCA, told the Guardian that the firm would await a reaction to the report \u2013 which was published by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) \u2013 from the world cycling governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI). The UCI has not yet officially responded to the Usada investigation.</p> <p>\"We will readdress the issue when we see if there is inaction or action from UCI,\" Dorough said. </p> <p>However, it is believed that it is likely that SCA will eventually take legal action, given the exhaustive nature of the Usada report. In more than 1,000 pages Usada detailed the alleged doping using testimony from 26 people, including 15 riders with knowledge of Armstrong's US Postal Service and Discovery Channel teams between 1998 and 2005. The study accused Armstrong, who has always protested his innocence, of effectively running a systemic blood-doping ring.</p> <p>The SCA case is not the only potential legal threat to Armstrong. An investigation into allegations that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs was dropped earlier this year by Andre Birotte, the US attorney for the central district of California. Birotte's office offered little explanation for the move, which came as a surprise to many in the global cycling community. </p> <p>A spokesman for Birotte's office, Bruce Riordan, said: \"Our office declines to comment on the matter in question.\"</p> <p>Some experts, however, believe that the investigation may be reopened as widespread outrage over the allegations in the Usada report creates political pressure to explain why it was dropped in the first place. </p> <p>\"The US attorney's office is always subject to political pressures. The criticism now will hit home and there is a good chance that the government will indict and charge Armstrong,\" said Peter Keane, a law professor at the Golden Gate University.</p> <p>Mike Straubel, from Valparaiso University, agreed. \"It is more of a political question than a legal one, but I would say there is a 70% chance of the case being reopened,\" he said.</p> <p>But others suspect there is little appetite for a re-opening a prosecution against Armstrong. They argue that the likelihood is that government lawyers had already amassed the same evidence as Usada, but had been put off by the high burdens of proof associated with putting a criminal case in front of a jury.</p> <p>The Guardian also understands that this aspect is a serious concern to government lawyers as they digest the reaction to the Usada report. </p> <p>\"I think everything in the Usada report, the government already saw. I don't think it is new information to them. Are they going to prosecute Lance Armstrong? I think the answer is no,\" said top California criminal attorney Paula Canny.</p> <p>Canny said Birotte and his team were likely mindful of the political implications of taking on the Armstrong case again, as the alleged crimes took place several years ago and involve a man who is still deeply involved in the fight against cancer. They would also likely base a case on issues like fraud, rather than steroid abuse in a sporting competition. </p> <p>\"They have a different and very high standard of proof that they would have to get,\" she said.</p> <p>Any decision by Birotte to re-open the Armstrong investigation would come after two other high-profile sports cases that ran into trouble. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/barry-bonds-guilty-obstructing-steroid-investigation?INTCMP=SRCH\">In December 2011, prosecutors were able to convict the baseball star Barry Bonds of obstructing justice</a>, but not of steroid abuse. In June this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10295456\">another baseball icon, Roger Clemens, was acquitted of all charges in a perjury trial over steroids</a>. </p> <p>\"If I were a betting man I would say they are absolutely, positively not going to re-open the investigation,\" said Professor Jordan Kobritz, chair of the Sports Management Department at SUNY Cortland.</p> <p>Kobritz said that any criminal prosecution would be tough to prove to a jury and would cost millions of dollars. </p> <p>\"It is a giant leap. But even if you took [that leap], there are better ways of spending taxpayers' money than prosecuting Lance Armstrong,\" he said.</p> <p>For the moment Armstrong is holding firm to his line that he has been the victim of a witch hunt. His lawyer, Tim Herman, has called the Usada report a \"hatchet job\" put together by people with grudges to settle or personal interests to look out for. That argument seems to have won through \u2013 for the moment at least \u2013 with sponsors and the cyclist's charity, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which is renowned for the Livestrong yellow bracelets that have become a world symbol of the fight against cancer. </p> <p>The LAF president, Doug Ulman, backed Armstrong and slammed Usada. \"Usada appears motivated more by publicity rather than fulfilling its mission. Lance Armstrong's legacy as a cancer fighter is literally second to none,\" he said in a statement.</p> <p>Armstrong's cancer work may also provide a cover for his many sponsors to stand by him, betting that the general public will still see his work in fighting the illness that nearly killed him as being far more important than his sporting behaviour. The sports giant Nike has issued a supportive statement and a host of other sponsors \u2013 representing everything from bikes to energy products \u2013 have simply declined to comment.</p> <p>For Kobritz, that silence speaks volumes. Even the Post Office \u2013 which sponsored his racing team \u2013 has declined to address the allegations. </p> <p>\"A lot of people who think he's guilty are going to say: 'So what? Maybe he did dope but look at what else he's done,'\" Kobritz said. However, he added: \"If anyone still believes he was not doping, then they believe in Santa Claus.\"</p>",
  "<p>What first occurred to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2012/oct/08/british-nobel-prize-john-gurdon-video\" title=\"\">Sir John Gurdon</a>, scientist, on hearing this week that he had won the Nobel prize for medicine, was presumably the joy of recognition. What next occurred was more basic. It was a chance for revenge against <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9594351/Sir-John-Gurdon-Nobel-Prize-winner-was-too-stupid-for-science-at-school.html\" title=\"\">his old science teacher, who had called his work \"disastrous\" and marked him to the bottom of the class</a>. Any ambition to be a scientist was \"a waste of time \u2026 quite ridiculous\".</p> <p>That was more than half a century back, but the wound clearly festered. Gurdon can shift a mean molecule, but he is not a man to forgive and forget. He passed his old report card to the press.</p> <p>My own Gurdon moment still burns in the memory. Set a 5th-form essay on \"sounds of town and country,\" I found the topic so boring I simply wrote down all the sounds I could think of, one after another. The teacher did not see the joke. He read out the essay, heavy with sarcasm, as I reddened and squirmed in miserable humiliation. \"I predict,\" he intoned, \"that this boy will never earn a living from the English language. He will be a grocer.\" The teacher's name was Stone. So was his heart.</p> <p>We can all list the successes whom school had \"failed\" \u2013 from Winston Churchill to Richard Branson. Less easy to list are those to whom school promised much that life did not honour: the prefects who ended in jail, the teacher's pets who took to booze. Some pupils, like Gurdon, might be galvanised by failure. Most are stripped of ambition and self-esteem at an age when bodies and minds are still forming. Such cruel unfairness is the single, overwhelming charge against selection at 11 \u2013 which the grammar school lobby has never answered and cannot.</p> <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/11/45000-resit-gcse-english-exams\" title=\"\">45,000 English pupils are now resitting their GCSE exams</a> after the latest fiasco in Britain's descent from education into testing. Reactionaries may cry that children should be taught that \"life is full of reverses\", but they have elevated the exam to make it the be-all and end-all of secondary education. It is they who treat academic measurement as an exact science, as they once did \"selection by intelligence\". It is they who have made the core curriculum the ark of the covenant of wisdom. They are the dunces of illiberalism.</p> <p>The GCSE curriculum, with its cores, foundations, inspectors and examiners, is a Victorian archaism on a par with the House of Lords and the Church of England. Education remains the most conservative of professions, because nobody quite knows what it means. A fixed curriculum is accepted because it exists. Like military discipline, past generations suffered it and the present one had better do so, too. It has become a useful tool of state dirigisme. While exams are restlessly reformulated, their subject matter is stuck back in days when \"maths and science\" were totems of economic fortune. Any other vocational or life skill was for \"secondary moderns\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytton_Strachey\" title=\"\">Lytton Strachey</a>, in his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_Victorians\" title=\"\">Eminent Victorians</a>, assailed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Arnold\" title=\"\">Thomas Arnold</a> of Rugby for making the English public school an engine of middle-class upbringing but for doing nothing about its content. Having upset his teachers making them teach, Arnold dared not upset them again by saying what should be taught. \"Hence the monastic and literary conceptions of education which had their roots in the middle ages,\" wrote Strachey, \"Arnold adopted almost without hesitation \u2026 the teaching of Latin and Greek grammar.\" The classics were beaten into&#xa0;children \"to train the mind\", just&#xa0;when the French and Germans were teaching science and technology, history and geography \u2013 and&#xa0;duly beating us commercially.</p> <p>Arnold still lives, with maths and science in place of Latin and Greek. Pundits are wheeled out to \"prove\" them either vital to the economy or, if not, then \"mind-training\". For millions of children, maths has replaced corporal punishment as subject of the phrase, \"It never did me any harm.\" Algebra and geometry are a liturgical creed, to be recited without question. History and geography, like literature, ethics or civics, are subjects for the devil.</p> <p>Britain's economy is in a mess not for&#xa0;lack of maths but for lack of ethics and common sense. Being top of the world in science did not save the Soviet&#xa0;Union from collapse. Young people need to understand computing, economics, law, the culture of the body, the history of community and the state of the environment. Schools send them out unable to write clearly or grapple with abstract concepts, yet chanting the periodic table like zombies.</p> <p>The collapse of educational progressivism in the 1980s and its replacement by \"teaching to the test\" was a real tragedy, caused largely by a sloppy overlay of political correctness and the reduced status of teachers. While the ideas of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey\" title=\"\">John Dewey</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Heinrich_Pestalozzi\" title=\"\">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner\" title=\"\">Rudolf Steiner</a> took hold in America, infusing much of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school\" title=\"\">charter school movement</a>, in Britain a \"good education\" is still identified with a juggernaut curriculum, nationally dictated, measured and moderated under stern ministerial audit. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\" title=\"\">Michael Gove</a>'s mechanistic centralism is not so much socialist as Soviet.</p> <p>If any benefit could emerge from the new \"free\" (meaning expensive) state school movement, it should be liberation and experiment. Yet most are promising a \"traditional curriculum\". British schools are still in Arnoldian mode. They teach what they think will train a mind, not educate a citizen. They observe medieval holidays. \"Lessons\" are so structured as to ensure most of what is learned in 50 minutes is forgotten and must be recapped a day or a week later. Language schools know that total immersion is far more efficient.</p> <p>Schools seem terrified of experimenting with new teaching methods or radical subjects. The academic terrorism of tests and league tables has made Gradgrind's rote-learning seem almost liberal. The British are adept reformers of institutions, in health, education, the law, even banking. They are dreadful at reforming what institutions do. Good for Gurdon for calling their bluff.</p>",
  "<p>The little orphaned badgers Bessie and Baz, one-time pets of the new environment secretary, Owen Paterson, are enjoying a surprising posthumous fame thanks to his new role overseeing the imminent cull in England, which could result in a third of the population being shot dead. \"I was perhaps about 10 years old when a local farmer rang us up to say he had found a young badger and would we take it in,\" Paterson reminisced in 2004. \"So we did; it was a female called Bessy and she lived in the boiler room. She was extremely intelligent, had a very low opinion of cats but loved the dogs. She was pretty well trained, she went in the car. Then we had another badger and as soon as they got together they dug their way out and ran away. It is terribly hard when welfare people see me as anti-badger, having known a badger very well.\"</p> <p>Yet Paterson is standing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">resolutely behind the cull</a>, dismissing opposition as \"sad sentimentality\" at this week's Conservative party conference. It is an issue he knows well having tabled a record 600 parliamentary questions on the problem of TB in cattle while shadow environment minister. That barrage is typical of the man, say those who know him, pointing to similar deep dives by Paterson into fisheries, roads and Northern Ireland. \"He is very committed, very diligent, thorough and good on detail and he is incredibly energetic,\" said Jacob Rees-Mogg, Conservative MP and a fellow member of the rightwing <a href=\"http://cornerstone-group.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Cornerstone group</a>.</p> <p>Paterson is Shropshire born-and-bred. The arrival of a true countryman \u2013 who derides \"metropolitan smartypants\" and says \"<a href=\"http://www.whitchurchherald.co.uk/news/115969/owen-paterson-new-defra-boss.aspx\" title=\"\">we have to manage the countryside</a>\" \u2013 at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) might have been expected to please many of those who care about the environment. In what some may call a display of his \"<a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/politics/2012/09/05/the-rise-and-rise-of-owen-paterson/\" title=\"\">good, old-fashioned, Shropshire common sense</a>\", he is said to have forbidden Defra officials from using the phrase \"ecosystem services\", a jargon phrase for the benefits bestowed by the natural world.</p> <p>But the overwhelming reaction from environmentalists \u2013 farmers and landowners excepted \u2013 was of horror. Instead of a countryman, they saw an apparent climate change sceptic, confirmed Eurosceptic and avowed slasher of red tape. His appointment to the ministry entrusted with enforcing the regulation \u2013 much of it from Brussels \u2013 that protects the environment was seen as the final confirmation that David Cameron's pledge to be the \"greenest government ever\" had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/05/reshuffle-owen-paterson-war-environment\" title=\"\">gone up in smoke</a>, as the party <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/05/reshuffle-coalition-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">shifted to the right</a>.</p> <p>Paterson is certainly a true-blue Tory, railing, for example, against red tape in a <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2011/12/extended-version-our-interview-with-owen-paterson/\" title=\"\">recent Spectator interview</a>: \"Government can wreck a business by confiscating its money by taxation. But confiscating its time is absolutely critical too.\" When officials in his new department were highlighting the difficulty of ignoring European environmental regulation, he is said to have told them: \"The French get away with it.\"</p> <p>Paterson voted for John Redwood, Iain Duncan Smith and Liam Fox in successive Tory leadership contests, and was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/22/tory-minister-opposes-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">first member of this cabinet to oppose gay marriage</a>. In short, he is the opposite of a Tory moderniser.</p> <p>But, given his new post, the most damaging charge is that he is a climate change sceptic. The suggestion is based on his opposition to \"ridiculous\", \"useless\" windfarms, \"intensely unpopular\" subsidies for renewable energy and his support for new runways and shale gas development, known as fracking. His performances at conference only hardened this view, with rabid denunciations of \"Soviet\" subsidies and threats to cut them, alongside enthusiasm for the fast tracking of fracking. However, Richard Betts, a meteorologist at the Met Office who heard Paterson's inaugural speech to staff at Defra, concluded he<a href=\"https://twitter.com/richardabetts/status/245446095386329088\" title=\"\"> was no climate change denier</a>.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Paterson has perplexingly chosen not to scotch the charge. \"Climate change is obviously happening and there is obviously a man-made contribution,\" he has said more than once. Failing to state that the burning of fossil fuels is by far the greatest contribution is a fudge frequently used by so-called sceptics: hence the greens' fears.</p> <p>For them, it gets worse. For a man frequently lauded for his intelligence and grip of detail, he can still peddle myths, stating in September: \"My concern is that some measures we take to [reduce carbon emissions] may be doing more damage. I am not convinced that building windfarms is the right way because you have more problems. You have to have gas backup \u2013 and that is operating inefficiently. So you have the problems that it's not reducing carbon emissions and it depends on very heavy public subsidy which is intensely unpopular with the people and businesses it damages.\"</p> <p>The facts are that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/26/myth-wind-turbines-carbon-emissions?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">windfarms unequivocally cut carbon</a> and that poll after poll reveals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/19/wind-power-poll-uk-public-favour\" title=\"\">overwhelming public support for renewable energy</a>. \"The notion that wind doesn't save carbon because of the need for back-up is simply incorrect,\" said Professor Robert Gross at Imperial College London.</p> <p>Paterson's loathing of windfarms may be out of kilter with national opinion, but it is firmly in step with his North Shropshire constituents. He is well-thought of there, according to Keith Harrison, editor of the <a href=\"http://www.shropshirestar.com/farming/farming-news/2012/09/14/environment-secretary-owen-paterson-is-backing-badger-cull/\" title=\"\">Shropshire Star</a>, and has increased his majority at four successive general elections, perhaps because he is the very model of a shires Tory MP.</p> <p>Brought up on a family farm and described as \"county set\" rather than grand, he went to Radley College, a public school, and studied history at Cambridge. Two decades followed in the family tannery business, supplying leather to luxury goods makers, and a time as president of the European Tanners Confederation, where he deployed his fluent French and German. \"He is no stupid little Englander,\" said <a href=\"http://www.respublica.org.uk/author/phillip_blond\" title=\"\">Phillip Blond</a>, director of the ResPublica thinktank and influential Tory moderniser.</p> <p>Paterson now lives in a large, 160-year-old, Grade II listed house a stone's throw from the Welsh border, where he keeps horses, sheep and chickens. He is married to the daughter of Viscount Matthew Ridley, linking him both to eight generations of Tory MPs and the prominent climate change sceptic Matt Ridley, his brother-in-law.</p> <p>His passion is horses \u2013 Betfair gave him and his wife <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/120903/120903.pdf\" title=\"\">\u00a31,000 of hospitality at Ascot in June</a> \u2013 and as with his other interests, Paterson leaps in, having completed a gruelling <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/outdoors/outdoor-activities/8912480/The-Mongol-Derby-the-worlds-most-gruelling-horse-race.html\" title=\"\">620-mile (1,000km) horse race across the deserts of Mongolia</a> this summer. But critics suggest that sometimes his self-confidence, energy and enthusiasm tips him into naivety, perhaps blinded by his own brilliance.</p> <p>Paterson's plan for protecting the UK's seas from overfishing was widely praised by environmentalists as \"having its heart in the right place\", but was founded on an impossible unilateral withdrawal from the European Union's fisheries policy. His first appearance on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mk8vc\" title=\"\">BBC's Farming Today</a> programme as environment secretary revealed an unexpected zeal for closing the UK's \"dessert deficit\". He said: \"One thing I have been banging on about, we have a dessert deficit in the UK. We still import a very large proportion of our desserts. I would ask everyone to go out and buy a British dessert.\"</p> <p>His energy showed as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, when he is said to have spent more time in the province than the secretary of state. Yet, despite being seen as a low-profile success when he served as Northern Ireland secretary after the 2010 election, he did propose that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1310342/Coalition-wants-Sinn-Fein-MPs-seats-Parliament.html\" title=\"\">Sinn F\u00e9in MPs should be allowed to swear a pledge of allegiance</a> not involving the Queen, an \"undoubtedly naive\" idea, according to seasoned observers.</p> <p>Coming out of the Northern Ireland post relatively unscathed is an achievement, according to Rees-Mogg: \"It is a very difficult brief to have and requires people to be pragmatic and get on with people with different opinions. Going in as a headbanging ideologue would be a very bad idea.\"</p> <p>Blond also defends Paterson: \"There has been a rush to judgment on Owen that has not been merited. I know Owen is very keen on community energy, for example.\" The official transcript of his conference speech demonstrates the limit of that keeness for renewables though: \"We must ensure that the right measures are deployed in the right places\" \u2013 ie not wind in Shropshire.</p> <p>Jonathan Porritt, one of the UK's most prominent environmentalists, <a href=\"http://www.jonathonporritt.com/blog/cabinet-reshuffle\" title=\"\">greeted his appointment by saying</a>: \"Sit back and enjoy the spectacle of Owen Paterson as secretary of state at Defra, who is as close to a latter-day reincarnation of [the Thatcherite environment secretary] Nicholas Ridley as we're likely to get. It really is astonishing to contemplate what was once a progressive and intelligent [Conservative] party so comprehensively engineering its own destruction.\"</p> <p>Paterson has so far simply ignored such criticism, instead focusing on his government's central obsession: reviving economic growth. \"My absolute priority, with clear instruction from the prime minister, is to do everything I can to improve and help conditions under which people can run businesses and generate wealth and jobs in the rural economy,\" said Paterson. \"The role of Defra is to make things easier for [rural] people and then to get out of people's hair.\"</p> <p>David Nussbaum, the head of WWF, whom Paterson phoned within days of taking office, warned: \"He has to engage in rural affairs, but his department has national responsibilities and international responsibilities too.\"</p> <p>For greens, this is the key. Improving the daily business of the countryside appears suited to Paterson. But on the broader issues of environment, energy and climate change, both as environment secretary and as a member of a government left distinctly less green after the reshuffle, the more he says, the more sceptical he appears. Greens fear that just as Paterson, an avowed badger-lover, has backed the widespread slaughter of the animals, the avowed lover of the countryside will fail to back the measures most experts say are needed to protect the world from global warming.</p> <h2>Pocket profile<br></h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> 24 June 1956</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 56</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> Paterson is a countryman raised on a farm who, after public school and Cambridge, spent 20 years in the family leather firm before becoming the very model of a true-blue Conservative MP in the shires.</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> Promotion to secretary of state for the environment, where he can apply his fierce Euroscepticism and loathing of red tape to getting Defra \"out of people's hair\".</p> <p><strong>Low point:</strong> Probably yet to come with the hugely controversial badger cull about to start and flooding on the rise at a time when Defra has cut the spending on flood defences.</p> <p><strong>What he says:</strong> \"We always had very well-intentioned Labour ministers at Defra who were completely urban and completely clueless.

There will be an upgrade to the Imperial War Museum by 2014 and funds to help secondary schools explore the Great War and its vast consequences.</p> <p>Cameron said he regarded the commemoration as a personal priority. He has appointed Tory MP Andrew Murrison, a former Royal Navy medical officer, as his special representative for the remembrance. The ambitious aim, Cameron said, was a commemoration, like the diamond jubilee celebrations, that \"captures our national spirit in every corner of the country, something that says something about who we are as a people\".</p> <p>It will also be another chance to commemorate Britishness and reflect on how it has developed \u2013 all in a year in which Alex Salmond will try to take the Scots out of the UK in a referendum. His Scottish National party government released a statement saying it would be fully involved in the remembrance.</p> <p>An emphasis will be placed on the global nature of the conflict and the loss of life not just in Britain, such as the 70,000 lost in the Indian Empire or the death of 27,000 Irish.</p> <p>Cameron studiously avoided discussing the morality of the Great War, or the long Conservative historiography, including Alan Clark, Niall Ferguson and Andrew Roberts, that has condemned the war as a catastrophic failure by a political and military elite \u2013 the conscripted lions notoriously led by the callous and unthinking donkeys dining behind the trenches.</p> <p>He skirted round the issue of historic responsibility for the misery but referred to the sheer scale of the sacrifice, pointing out that, among more than 14,000 parishes in the whole of England and Wales, only about 50 so-called \"thankful parishes\" saw all their soldiers return.</p> <p>He said: \"When the soldiers set out, none of the armies had any idea of the length and scale of the trauma that was to unfold. For many, going off to war was a rite of passage. Many were excited. They would eat better than they had working down the mines or the textile mills. They would have access to better medical care. And many thought they would be home for Christmas.\"</p> <p>Detailing the tally of death, including 20,000 British soldiers lost on 1&#xa0;July 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme, he said: \"It seems inexplicable that the countries which had many things binding them together would indulge in such a never-ending slaughter, but they did.\"</p> <p>Murrison told the Guardian: \"We do commemorations very well in this country and it is no celebration. It is remembrance. We are making no judgment about fault, right to wrong, certainly no attempt to indulge in any jingoistic sentiment. The fact is that it happened. Millions of people died.</p> <p>\"The consequences of this we still live with today, and our commemoration in the UK will be firmly focused on that narrow ground, and I will leave to others the interpretation of history.\"</p> <p>A committee including historians Prof Michael Burleigh, a specialist in nazism, and Brigadier Prof Hew Strachan, a specialist in the military history of the war, will advise on the tone of the events. The first world war novelists Sebastian Faulks and Pat Barker will also be on the committee, along with leading defence figures from each party: Lord King, Lord Robertson and Menzies Campbell.</p> <p>But Cameron said the remembrance was less about committees than a matter of the heart. Disclosing that Goodbye to All That by Robert Graves was his favourite book, the prime minister argued that the war captivated the British mind. \"We look at those fast-fading sepia photographs of people posing stiffly, proudly in uniform, in many cases the first and last image ever taken of them. The stories and writing the Great War has inspired deeply affect us \u2013 a mix of horror and courage, suffering as well as hope, has permeated our culture.\"</p> <p>In looking back and seeking to understand, it is worth recalling how little war leaders themselves felt they knew why they were acting as they were. David Lloyd George, the prime minister during the war, revealed in his memoirs he had experienced the war as an exploration into an unknown land. He wrote: \"What must be the sensation of a man who took a leading part in the direction of this tremendous war and undertakes to recall these events with their horrors, their perils and amazing escapes? It is like that of a traveller who revisits dangerous rapids through which once upon a time he once helped to pilot a boat without map, without knowledge and without any experience to guide him or any of the crew as to the course of the river, its depths and shallows, its sharp and unexpected bends, the strength and whirl of the current, or the location of the hidden rocks in its channel.\"</p>",
  "<p>In October 1997, Nicolas Winding Refn sat watching old sci-fi movies in an attic room in a small hotel off Oxford Street. A few days past his 27th birthday, the fledgling Danish director had been brought to Britain to promote his first film, a low-budget crime drama called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/66726/pusher\" title=\"\">Pusher</a>. \"It was a glorious moment,\" he recalls. \"The film had done more than I ever thought it could \u2013 it had left Copenhagen. For me that was like making Star Wars.\"</p> <p>Fifteen years on, he sits in another, larger Soho hotel \u2013 a sleek and genial figure whose last film, the neon-lit thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142036/drive\" title=\"\">Drive</a>, carried him into Hollywood's upper levels. A London-set remake of his debut is about to be released, on which his credit is executive producer. He is here to reminisce. To walk between the two hotels would take minutes, yet the journey from one to the other has been outlandish \u2013 an odyssey through the film industries of Britain, the US and Scandinavia with a detour to India and a baroque cast of real-life characters. The new Pusher is, in fact, a second remake, joining a pair of sequels Refn made himself in what must surely be modern cinema's most unlikely franchise.</p> <p>The original plot was classically simple, a seven-day countdown as a Copenhagen heroin dealer tries to settle a debt to a louche but vicious Serbian gangster. Refn's gift for casting was clear \u2013 the burly Kim Bodnia gave anti-hero Frank a glowering magnetism, the much-admired Mads Mikkelsen took a first screen role as his sidekick. The result hummed with promise \u2013 the son of Danish film-makers who spent his youth in 80s New York, Refn instinctively fused the swagger of American crime movies with handheld European v\u00e9rit\u00e9.</p> <p>In Denmark, the film was a huge and unexpected hit. The rest of the world failed to notice. It took British distributor Metrodome to brave a first international release. In the last moments before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/67567/trainspotting\" title=\"\">Trainspotting</a> became old news, company founder Rupert Preston cannily sold Refn as \"the Danish Danny Boyle\" and the film won an audience big enough to stir interest elsewhere. \"Britain is where it all started,\" Refn says. \"This place got me out of my cage.\"</p> <p>For its director, Pusher had served its purpose: he came to see the movie as a film student might regard their final coursework, with fond memories of a riotous shoot, a supporting cast of club kids and local heavies, and a snotty commitment to authenticity that meant \"all the cocaine on set being real\". Assuming all that was now behind him, Refn got on with the rest of his career. Eventually, inevitably, he headed to the US. In 2003 came a wilfully opaque thriller called <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96278/fear.x\" title=\"\">Fear X</a>, starring John Turturro. It baffled almost all who saw it. All, essentially, was no one. Its director was left financially ruined. \"I was down and out,\" Refn says. \"I owed the bank a million dollars. I was depressed, humiliated, I had just had my first child. I felt like a rock'n'roll suicide.\"</p> <p>If the scale of his debt outdid Frank in Pusher, there was a mordant irony to the solution \u2013 the \"despicable sell-out\" of making not one but two belated sequels. He had few other offers. In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/107127/with.blood.on.my.hands\" title=\"\">Pusher II </a>\u2013 Refn now calls it \"the girly Pusher\" \u2013 Mikkelsen's goonish sadsack attempted fatherhood. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113001/pusher-3\" title=\"\">Pusher III</a> focused on Milo, the ageing gangster again played by Zlatko Buric, a crazy-haired 6ft 5in Croatian steeped in avant-garde theatre who had stolen much of the first movie. Yet there would be a twist. Born as desperate cash-ins, the sequels won Refn new levels of critical acclaim. They also made just enough money to pay off the bank. An unhappy spell <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/sep/08/nicolas-winding-refn-interview\" title=\"\">making Miss Marple TV movies</a> still lay ahead. But old friendships endured. Preston had by now left Metrodome for Vertigo Films, a hard-nosed outfit whose movies were keenly attuned to the market. Having produced Refn's Pusher sequels, he now suggested a remake.</p> <p>Given the original's strong characters and ticking-clock conceit, he wasn't the first. A script appeared from an American producer. Fox discussed making a network TV show. Given the nature of Refn's career, it was therefore predictable that the first remake of Pusher would be developed in Leicester and shot in Hindi.</p> <p>A cheerful Anglo-Indian actor from the east Midlands, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/assadfilm\" title=\"\">Assad Raja</a> had nursed a passion for the film since 1997. Finally, after years telling friends he wanted to make a film \"a bit like Pusher\" to escape the weary chase for roles on The Bill, he approached Refn for the rights to direct a fully fledged remake \u2013 a showcase for his talents aimed at the Indian film business. Refn, says Raja, was \"amused\" by the thought of his debut going Bollywood. Casting himself in the lead and shooting in London, his production was almost as chaotic as the original: unable to find an Asian actor to play a henchman, Raja narrowly avoided having to \"brown up\" a white bodybuilder. In the end, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1082075/\" title=\"\">his film came out in 2010</a> sharing the same scruffy, adrenal energy as its inspiration while adding a&#xa0;sub-plot about the cricket world cup.</p> <p>India, to Raja's disappointment, was unmoved. At home, too, while the film found a fanbase on DVD, not everyone saw the commercial potential.</p> <p>In the meantime, Refn had agreed to Preston's idea of their own remake, set in London. It would be a mistake to see him as an innocent among moneymen. By his own account, his career began at 21, when his uncle \u2013 then owner of Denmark's biggest arthouse distributor \u2013 recruited him to scout for films at Cannes. \"That was my education,\" he says. \"I never approached film-making as an art. I saw it as what sells.\"</p> <p>For most of the remake's production, he was in Bangkok making his next film, cop thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/01/best-film-directors-world-2012\" title=\"\">Only God Forgives</a>. But his involvement went much further than the executive producer's typical role of turning up for the premiere. The choice of writer \u2013 former TV producer Matthew Read \u2013 was his. He and Preston together picked director Luis Prieto, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/11860629\" title=\"\">a Spanish maker of Italian romantic comedies</a>. The budget was set at $1m (\u00a3623,000) \u2013 a sum Preston says ensured fidelity to the tone of the original, but which must also have relaxed the accountants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397580665\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349964430536/Kim-Bodnia-in-the-origina-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Bodnia in the original Pusher\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Bodnia as Frank in Nicolas Winding Refn's original Pusher. Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fighting jetlag in an east London bar, Prieto describes Refn's role in the new Pusher as \"like God \u2013 usually invisible, but always there\". Casting decisions, he says, were collaborative \u2013 hiring ex-model <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/feb/26/agyness-deyn-supermodel-stage\" title=\"\">Agyness Deyn</a> as Frank's stripper girlfriend Flo was an idea put to him by the producers, but one he gladly accepted. Once he did, he insisted neither she nor co-star Richard Coyle should watch the original film, ensuring the only principal actor who had seen it had also starred in it \u2013 Buric, returning as Milo after coaxing from Refn.</p> <p>Prieto says he made his movie with two goals \u2013 to create something more stylised than the original and to foreground the character of Flo. On those terms, he succeeds. Deyn is a vivid presence, while $1m buys you a lot of slickness in 2012. And if the remake does sometimes make you pine for the Pusher you saw back in 1997, the truth \u2013 expressed politely but without apology by all concerned \u2013 is that it's not really for you: \"Luis's version is for a new audience,\" Preston says. \"So many people won't have seen the original. If you're 20 now, you were five when it came out.\"</p> <p>Similarly, if there were fears that setting Pusher in London might taint the film with geezerism, in fact the remake feels strikingly little like London. Shot in Stoke Newington, the standard-issue urban backdrops could often be anywhere. For Preston, hiring a director with no connection to the capital was deliberate \u2013 the result of a desire not to make \"one of those British crime movies we see too often\". But in a global film market there may be other benefits \u2013 giving an international audience the hint of local flavour without enough of it to scare them off.</p> <p>This way, it seems, lies the future. Because rather than their remake ending the Pusher story, Refn and Preston see it as the start of a new chapter \u2013 or chapters. A working model is ready to go \u2013 Refn matching up a character, a city and a skeletal story, before the two men then find writers and directors to make the movie. So next will be a sequel to the remake \u2013 not, to be clear, a remake of the sequel \u2013 following Deyn as Flo to a new life in Las Vegas. Then it will once more be the turn of the tireless Buric, though Refn is unsure where to put him: \"Zlatko could go anywhere. Maybe Tokyo.\"</p> <p>Asked how many Pushers he might ultimately father, he pauses. \"At one point I wanted to do 10,\" he says. \"I'll keep going until the ideas run out.\" He sips his cappuccino. \"So far they never have.\"</p>",
  "<p>The huge logistical challenge of delivering millions of new iPhone&#xa0;5s all over the world has led to a spike in the cost of air freight.</p> <p>Transport experts said the launches of Apple products have become such big business for the air cargo industry that delivery firms and airlines have chartered dozens of extra planes, cancelled scheduled routes and ditched staff training during \"Operation iPhone Drop\".</p> <p>In the latest quarterly health check on the US economy, published on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook/beigebook201210.htm\" title=\"\">the Federal Reserve said</a>: \"Air cargo companies saw an increase in cargo volume tied to the launch of various smartphones and computer tablets, which favour shipment by air over other modalities.\"</p> <p>Martin Dixon of freight research firm Drewry said the delivery of the iPhone had helped the air freight industry bounce back from a collapse in prices \u2013 July were the lowest since July 2009, when most of the developed world was gripped by recession.</p> <p>Dixon said the indicative average cost of air freight from China to the west had risen 7% to $3.56 (\u00a32.20) per kg between August and September, and he expected it to rise even higher this month in the wake of the iPhone&#xa0;5 launch.</p> <p>He said Apple has had a \"huge impact\" on the air freight industry, which is experiencing a deep contraction as many companies cut spending by transporting more goods by sea.</p> <p>\"Only a few years ago smartphones weren't around, now they make up a huge part of air freight goods,\" he said. \"Apple is very clever at how it manages its supply chain, and its ability to secure air freight capacity to launch new models is a key part of that strategy.\"</p> <p>John Manners-Bell, chief executive of research firm Transport Intelligence, said Apple's demand for air cargo capacity was so large that it was \"able to skew rates across a large proportion of the global air cargo market\".</p> <p>He said it was too early to say how much rates had risen as result of the iPhone&#xa0;5, launched on 21 September, but said prices spiked by 20% when Apple launched the latest iPad version in March.</p> <p>Manners-Bell said Apple was now \"by far the biggest air cargo shipper in the world by some margin\", and the industry was awash with rumours about measures taken by logistics companies and airlines to meet the US company's demands. \"There is talk of airlines pulling scheduled routes to [have more planes free] to serve the Apple account,\" he said.</p> <p>Kevin Sterling, a freight transport analyst at BB&amp;T Capital Markets, said he had heard that Apple had chartered up to 70 jets in the runup to the launch of the iPhone. He predicted thatthe air freight rate could reach as high as $5 per kg in the days surrounding the launch.</p> <p>US delivery giant FedEx postponed training classes for staff during the first few days of the iPhone launch as it prepared for a \"surge event\", according to an internal memo leaked to MacRumours.</p> <p>The analysts said none of the big delivery companies would divulge the impact of the iPhone, but Chinese delivery firm THI Group, which provides freight services for a company that assembles the iPhone 5, reported a 50% rise in profits from Hong Kong and China on Thursday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/24/iphone5-apple-sales-first-weekend\" title=\"\">Apple sold 5m iPhone&#xa0;5s in the first three days after the product launched</a>, but a withdrawal of scratched phones before delivery has led to sales forecasts for the iPhone&#xa0;5 in the last three months of this year being cut from 57m units to 49m.</p>",
  "<p>Spain defied renewed pressure to accept an international bailout on Thursday, a stance that could last for several more weeks or even months despite the humiliation of having its credit rating cut to near junk status.</p> <p>As the head of the International Monetary Fund called on governments to co-operate to heal a fractured global economy, credit rating agency Standard and Poor's said recession was limiting Spain's policy options and any delay in seeking a rescue risked a further downgrade. Moody's said it may soon follow suit.</p> <p>Prime minister Mariano Rajoy, however, struck a defiant tone when he said that tough labour reforms and the rebuilding of its tarnished banking sector meant the IMF's dire forecast for Spain's economy would not be realised.</p> <p>\"If we follow that strategy \u2026 we'll see that the reality turns out to be better than the forecasts,\" he said.</p> <p>Rajoy's position was strengthened as Spain's key 10-year bond yield remained unchanged on Thursday despite the S&amp;P move. He is thought to want to wait at least until after regional elections on 21 October to ask for aid and even later if the European Central Bank's bond buying keeps borrowing costs down.</p> <p>He is supported by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who does not want to explain another bailout to her voters.</p> <p>Speaking at its annual meeting in Tokyo, IMF chief Christine Lagarde warned that only with greater co-operation and courage could governments hope to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.</p> <p>After banking regulators told her some parts of the financial system were as unsafe as before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, she said policymakers needed to take immediate action to resolve issues hanging over from the crisis.</p> <p>\"There are threats on the horizon, threats that can be addressed, should be addressed but are not necessarily addressed,\" she said.</p> <p>Europe has come under fire for its failure to end the eurozone debt crisis. Leaders in the US and Asia have become frustrated at delays in agreeing measures to bolster Greece, Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>Lagarde said: \"We expect action and we expect courageous and co-operative action on the part of our members.\"</p> <p>The IMF has expressed frustration with Europe's piecemeal response to its debt crisis and warned that a recent respite in borrowing costs for debt-laden countries such as Spain may prove short-lived unless eurozone leaders come up with a comprehensive and credible plan.</p> <p>The IMF itself came under fire after it admitted in its World Economic Outlook report that officials had underestimated the effects of austerity measures on economic growth. The report found that for every \u00a31 of spending cuts the economy shrank by about \u00a31.30, compared with the previous estimate of 50p.</p> <p>The IMF was a strong supporter of the austerity measures adopted by western countries including Britain in the aftermath of the financial crisis, but it has U-turned in recent months and urged governments to plan their reforms over longer periods to lessen the impact on growth.</p> <p>Lagarde said on Thursday that struggling countries should have more time to meet budget cuts. \"It is sometimes better to have a bit more time,\" she said. \"That is what we advocated for Portugal, this is what we advocated for Spain and this is what we are advocating for Greece.\"</p> <p>Lagarde also said, however, that she backed the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who argued it was necessary to pursue government spending cuts or risk a backlash from international money markets and a rise in borrowing costs.</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to admit next month in his autumn statement that he has missed at least one of his deficit reduction targets. He has already announced an extension of the government's rolling five-year austerity programme to 2018.</p> <p>Oxfam warned that the IMF's focus on the eurozone should not be at the expense of the world's poorest. \"It's imperative that the poorest countries are not overlooked at this meeting.

  "<p>Luxury fashion brand Burberry has blamed slowing sales on the spending squeeze faced by middle-class designer label lovers who can no longer afford to satisfy their lust for \u00a31,000 handbags or \u00a3500 dresses.</p> <p>Finance director Stacey Cartwright said that while its wealthiest customers were spending more than ever, so-called \"aspirational\" shoppers \u2013 a term used to describe consumers who spend a large chunk of their disposable income on designer labels but cannot stretch to the most expensive items \u2013 were staying away from the shops.</p> <p>\"The reason traffic [in stores] is down is because aspirational luxury shoppers are more impacted by the macro economic environment,\" she said. \"Higher spending luxury consumers are more resilient and have carried on spending.\"</p> <p>She also complained that the Olympics had hurt sales in London.</p> <p>Analysts said the divide between wealthy and middle-class customers was reflected in the fortunes of Burberry's various brands. Its most expensive ranges, such as \"Prorsum\", which it shows on the catwalk, and \"London\", were doing well while sales of cheaper casualwear line \"Brit\" slumped.</p> <p>Last month the 156-year-old British company, famous for its raincoats lined with a distinctive camel, red and black check pattern, spooked investors with a profit warning that knocked \u00a31bn off its stock market value. At that time it said growth had stalled in July and August, particularly in China, which has been the driving force of a near three-year boom in demand for luxury goods, sparking fears that the luxury sector could face a fresh downturn.</p> <p>On Thursday, Burberry was able to soothe nerves after demand picked up during September, enabling it to eke out underlying retail sales growth of 1% for the second quarter as a whole \u2013 albeit a marked slowdown on the 6% seen in the previous quarter. It also said that profit margins at its retail and wholesale divisions would be the same as last year for the first six months of the year, rather than lower as it had previously warned. The signs of improvement sent the shares rocketing to the top of the FTSE 100 risers' list, closing up more than 13% at \u00a311.36.</p> <p>\"While there is still uncertainty over the impact the global economic slowdown will have on luxury spending, we are reassured that demand has not fallen off a cliff and so believe the shares have been oversold,\" said Seymour Pierce analyst Kate Calvert.</p> <p>The Olympics also proved to be a major headache for the British brand as the tourists who ventured to London during the summer came to watch sport rather than shop. \"London was a lot quieter than usual when it came to shopping,\" said Cartwright. \"We have a much greater exposure to London than many of our peers because it is our home market.\"</p> <p>The number of foreign visitors to the UK actually fell 5% to 3m in August compared with a year ago according to official figures while airports operator BAA said 9.5m passengers passed through its airports in August, down 2% on 2011. Asian tourists, predominantly from China, are among Burberry's biggest customers in major tourist cities such as London and some analysts think they may have either delayed travel plans, fearing transport chaos, or cancelled them altogether as confidence in their powerhouse economy falters.</p> <p>In the wake of the profit alert analysts have questioned the sales outlook faced by luxury goods companies although the picture was confused by upbeat figures from Italian fashion brand Prada which said it had not experienced a slowdown.</p> <p>China is the big prize for the luxury goods industry with the country expected to become the biggest single market by 2015 but, along with the UK, it is currently Burberry's weakest market.</p> <p>Cartwright said sales had been affected by a decline in gift-giving ahead of next month's leadership change. She denied there was a problem with the Burberry brand, arguing its experience reflected the global economic backdrop and would be echoed in the results of peers such as Louis Vuitton owner LVMH and PPR, which owns Gucci, which will update investors in the coming weeks.</p>",
  "<p>The energy secretary, Ed Davey, has forced through <a href=\"https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/EIP/pages/projects/LostockDecision.pdf\" title=\"\">approval for a giant incineration plant</a> in the constituency of chancellor, in the latest skirmish between the Department for Energy and the Treasury.</p> <p>George Osborne was first to sign 25,000-strong petition against building in Cheshire an energy-from-waste plant that will devour 600,000 tonnes of rubbish every year. But Davey gave <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_113/pn12_113.aspx\" title=\"\">final approval for the plan</a> on 2 October, leaving a high court challenge as the only remaining option for the chancellor and fellow opponents.</p> <p>\"I campaigned hard against the incinerator and am, therefore, naturally disappointed with the decision,\" he told constituents, many of whom were enraged by the decision.</p> <p>Brian Cartwright, chair of the Cheshire against Incinerators group, said: \"This news is devastating for those who live in Northwich and the surrounding area, particularly because the government has clearly not listened to the people who are united in their opposition. It exposes the doctrine of 'localism' as a cynical confidence trick.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) said: \"It is essential we have a balanced energy mix in the future to provide low cost, efficient energy.

It will provide power for Tata's nearby chemicals plant, which Osborne once praised as an \"<a href=\"http://www.georgeosborne4tatton.com/news/brunner-mond\" title=\"\">important local employer</a>\". In a further embarrassment for him, Martin Ashcroft, Tata Chemicals Europe managing director, blamed \"ever-rising gas prices which are increasingly difficult to absorb\" as the reason for the incinerator. Osborne has pushed a renewed \"dash for gas\" as the solution to Britain's energy problems, describing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/21/environment-budget-2012-osborne-planning\" title=\"\">fuel as \"cheap\" in his budget speech</a>.</p> <p>The role of gas, as well as renewable energy, are at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/02/george-osborne-cuts-windfarm-subsidies\" title=\"\">his dispute with Davey</a>. But urgent efforts are being made to resolve the row. A senior Conservative source told the Guardian that David Cameron is now personally re-engaging with the green agenda, recognising it as one of the few growing parts of the economy. There will be a meeting of the all-powerful coalition quad \u2013 Cameron, Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander \u2013 in the next week, the source said: \"The PM wants to bring the Treasury and Decc on to the same page. The Treasury has to sign up to the renewable energy agenda, while Decc has to reassure on costs.\"</p>",
  "<p>Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make smart. \"Smart\" is an interesting adjective, as evidenced by the <em>OED</em>'s extensive entry for it. The interpretation that is now ubiquitous is this: \"Capable of independent and seemingly intelligent action.\" As in \"smartphones\". And, now, \"smart meters\" for gas and electricity.</p> <p>Governments across the world have become obsessed with smart meters. Their introduction has been US policy since 2007, for example, when President George W Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act \u2013 and allocated $4.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) for the development of a \"smart\" electricity grid. In 2009, the European Union followed suit with a directive mandating smart metering in households by 2022, which, in relation to the scale of what has to be done is, the blink of an eye.</p> <p>On the face of it, smart metering is a good idea, at least for electricity, the demand for which <a href=\"http://www.mpoweruk.com/electricity_demand.htm\" title=\"\">fluctuates during the day</a>. The surges that accompany half-time in major football matches as the nation stampedes to put its kettle on, for example, are the stuff of legend. But they are also the stuff of nightmares, because if an electricity grid is overwhelmed by demand, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_failure\" title=\"\">consequences can be dire,</a> as <a href=\"http://blogs.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Whathappensif/entry/how-and-why-the-indian-power-grid-collapsed\" title=\"\">India discovered recently</a>, when more than 700 million people were left without power. Even in normal circumstances, the variation in demand (for households: low at night, high in the early evening; for businesses: high during normal working hours) means that the grid has to be able to deal with peaks and troughs \u2013 and always meet the peaks. There are significant gains, both in financial and environmental terms, from finding ways of evening out some of the fluctuation.</p> <p>Which is where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_meter\" title=\"\">smart meters</a> come in. The meters currently in domestic use are dumb devices that can deal with, at most, two options: a simple 24-hour tariff or a dual (day and night) tariff. Smart meters, which are essentially small, networked computers, can provide much finer \"granularity\" (measuring consumption on an hourly basis, say) and can communicate that information to both the consumer and the supplier. More importantly, the supplier can also communicate directly with the meter.</p> <p>Underpinning the argument for smart meters are a number of assumptions. One is that, if consumers know how much electricity they are using at any given moment, then they will become more careful about how they use it. Another is that smart metering will enable utility companies to vary the cost per unit on an hourly basis. So electricity might cost 2p a unit at 3am but 12p a unit at 6pm, when the nation gets home, starts cooking and switches on the TV. The combination of these two charges should mean that peak demand is reduced, thereby making operation of the grid easier and less wasteful.</p> <p>There's a good case for rethinking the way we supply and charge for electricity, because if we go on as we are \u2013 with a dumb grid, dumb meters and accelerating demand \u2013 then we'll eventually find ourselves with the problems that the Indians experienced recently. And that doesn't bear thinking about.</p> <p>The problem is that the way the government is approaching the issue doesn't exactly inspire confidence. The lead department, <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Environment and Climate Change</a>, has prepared a cost-benefit analysis that purports to show that the stupendous cost of installing new, networked kit in every building in the UK will be outweighed by the \u00a37.1bn in <a href=\"http://www.cse.org.uk/downloads/file/smart_metering_programme_consumer_review_for_Which.pdf\" title=\"\">benefits</a> that the new system will confer on grateful citizens. As the Duke of Wellington famously said to the man who came up to him saying: \"Mr Smith, I believe\", if you believe that then you will believe anything.</p> <p>DECC's calculations have recently been subjected to a lacerating <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SmartMetering-Feb82012.pdf\" title=\"\">critique</a> by Alex Henney and Professor Ross Anderson of the Cambridge Computer Lab. They examined how the department's \"successive reworkings involved a reduction in costs, an increase in benefits, and stretch credulity given some of the assumptions. Yet deployment over the next few years will make the truth clear enough\".</p> <p>It will. What we have in the making is another multibillion-pound government IT disaster of the kind that Whitehall has made its unique speciality. And that's only the half of it. Because embedded in the technology of smart metering is an even more worrying possibility about which the government (and the electricity utilities) has been strangely taciturn. The utilities love the technology because it will enable them to disconnect consumers remotely who don't pay their bills.</p> <p>But the capacity for remote cutoff in a networked system opens up a huge national <a href=\"www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/meters-offswitch.pdf\" title=\"\">cybersecurity vulnerability</a>. After all, if E.ON can remotely disconnect every house in East Anglia, so too can a hacker in China. Still, if that happens we'll still be able to read, by candlelight, the <em>OED</em>'s top definition of \"smart\": \"an instance of sharp physical pain, esp caused by a blow, sting or wound.\"</p>",

The Boston-based investment manager is a Mitt Romney donor who has met the candidate on several occasions, both as the Massachusetts governor and as the would-be president. </p> <p>Despite a global financial meltdown that has finished off nearly every other world leader, Romney didn't seem to have the momentum to unseat President Barack Obama. But all that changed after Romney trounced Obama in their first debate.</p> <p>With opinion polls showing Romney gaining support since then, Sotell, the founder of investment adviser Kraematon Group, says this is finally Romney's opportunity to spotlight his real talent. \"Obama has one terrific skill set, and that's campaigning. But we don't need the most popular guy in the room; we don't need the guy who is best on Letterman. We need a man with an economic plan,\" he says. \"Mitt Romney is that man.\"</p> <p>The Guardian came to Boston, the capital of Romney's home state, to examine his economic plan as the year-long election battle enters its final stage. With growth, jobs and the deficit likely to be crucial in deciding the election, our series will move on to West Virginia to look at poverty and inequality \u2013 one of the biggest issues facing the US and yet barely mentioned directly by the candidates \u2013 and then to North Carolina to investigate the relationship between Barack Obama's stewardship of the economy and his struggle to rekindle the hope of 2008.</p> <p>Obama inherited the deepest economic slump since the great depression when he was elected in 2008. He has presided over the weakest recovery since the second world war. The slow, unsteady pace of recovery has allowed Romney to lambast Obama for his lack of a growth strategy. \"The president doesn't have a plan. I do,\" Romney said on the stump in Virginia this week.</p> <p>Romney's blueprint has five major themes: a $4.8tn tax cut spread over the next 10 years; a proposal to cut government spending to less than 20% of national output; energy self-sufficiency; better schools; and a tougher approach to America's trade relations with China.</p> <p>Many economists are sceptical about the plan. They doubt the sincerity of anti-Beijing rhetoric, given that China owns one third of the bonds sold by the US to finance its debts. Many believe that Romney's energy self-sufficiency means ripping up environmental safeguards in favour of big oil.</p> <p>But most significantly, few but the most avid supply-siders think that big tax cuts aimed primarily at the better-off is the answer to America's growing debt problem. Most in fact think the combination of tax breaks for the wealthy combined with austerity for everybody else will make the problem worse.</p> <p>Simon Johnson, a former chief economist at the IMF and now a professor at MIT in Cambridge, said the tax-cutting approach was tried by the previous Republican president, George Bush. \"It didn't work then and it won't work now,\" he said. Robert Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, said Romney's approach defied every textbook ever written, and if the lion's share of tax cuts went to the better-off, they would tend to save rather than spend the windfall.</p> <p>Sotell disagrees. He says the debate on taxes is a sideshow, and the president has declared \"class war\" on high earners for political gain. America is paralyzed, says Sotell. Business leaders hold billions on the sidelines fearing what Obama will do to taxes, regulation and the cost of his landmark \"Obamacare\" legislation. Further down the road the US faces a demographic time-bomb: baby-boomers are retiring and expect benefits that the US can no longer afford.</p> <p>\"And what's Obama talking about? Millionaires and billionaires not paying enough tax. That's not going to solve the problem,\" he says. \"We owe $16tn; we added another trillion this year. If you tax the top group another $100bn, how does that offset anything?\"</p> <p>For Sotell, Romney showed an ability to compromise with a largely Democratic legislature when he was governor of Massachusetts. Obama has sown nothing but discord, he argues. Romney is a man with a proven track record in finance and a man who, like Sotell, believes economic growth is driven by private enterprise and not government spending.</p> <p>The latest polls suggest that Romney's message may now be reaching more ears. But Bruce Stokes of the Pew Research Center says the outlook for either candidate is far from certain. \"If Obama is going to win, it's despite all the economic numbers. Despite the fact that some of the swing states voters think Romney would do a better job,\" he says.</p> <p>And philosophy aside, Romney's plan is \"wafer thin\", according to Kevin Gallagher, director of the global development programme at Boston University. \"He doesn't have a sophisticated plan to put to the Office of Management and Budget to be costed. Even Bush did that.</p> <p>\"An independent thinktank has tried a simulation, and it found that the plan doesn't add up. It would increase the deficit by $400bn a year. Romney says that would be filled by closing tax loopholes \u2013 but without specifying exactly how.\"</p> <p>What both sides do agree upon is the scale of the problem ahead. Whoever wins the election will face immediate and tough decisions to take on the deficit. Under the compromise reached between the White House and Congress in the summer of 2011, tax breaks will expire and spending will be cut in January 2013. These will be worth 4% of US GDP \u2013 enough to tip not just the US but the entire global economy back into recession, according to the IMF this week.</p> <p>Gallagher says Romney's experiment with the sort of austerity policies being pursued in Europe risks leading to lower growth, higher unemployment and rising national debt. Romney's supporters say that cutting spending will pave the way for lower taxes. Entrepreneurs will respond by growing their businesses and hiring more workers.</p> <p>In the warehouses of south Boston's burgeoning innovation district, there's a different take on the economic battle. Tom Pincince, president of Digital Lumens, a hi-tech Boston business making energy-efficient lighting, says the political bickering is among the biggest problems his business faces. Growth is already great for the firm \u2013 not least because they promise to slash lighting bills to the bone. But customers are nervous.</p> <p>He dismisses the idea that tax cuts add jobs. \"I am not going to hire more people because my taxes are cut,\" Pincince said. \"I will hire more people if my business is doing well.\" What annoys him is all the political infighting. He says government's first job should be to create an environment where customers feel confident enough to spend more money. Romney has just two more weeks to convince America that he is the man for that job.</p>",
  "<p>Environmentalists campaigning to prevent the wholesale destruction of the Indonesian rainforest scored a major victory on Wednesday after coaxing the Walt Disney company, one of the world's largest publishers of children's books, to revamp its paper purchasing policies.</p> <p>After two years of occasionally testy exchanges and intense negotiation with the Rainforest Action Network (Ran), a San Francisco-based advocacy group, Disney agreed in a new written policy to do everything it could to safeguard endangered forests and their ecosystems, which support the sorts of animals celebrated in Disney feature films and their multimedia spinoffs.</p> <p>\"Disney is adding its voice to the growing chorus of companies demonstrating that there's no need to sacrifice endangered forests in Indonesia or elsewhere for the paper we use every day,\" Ran's executive director Rebecca Tarbotton said in a statement.</p> <p>Or, as another activist for the organization put it: \"The Jungle Book will no longer be destroying the jungle.\"</p> <p>Disney will now avoid the mixed tropical hardwoods typically harvested in the Indonesian rainforest and will seek alternative sources such as recycled paper and wood harvested according to the recommendations of the internationally recognized Forest Stewardship Council. </p> <p>The company said in a <a href=\"http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-news/press-releases/2012/10/disney-announces-paper-sourcing-and-use-policy\">news release</a> accompanying its <a href=\"ttp://thewaltdisneycompany.com/citizenship/policies/paper-sourcing\">new written policy</a> that it would \"work with non-governmental organizations to identify and prioritize regions with poor forest management and high rates of deforestation\". It also pledged to issue annual reports on its progress.</p> <p>Disney is the ninth major US publisher to switch its paper purchasing policy in response to an alarming study <a href=\"http://ran.org/sites/default/files/turning_the_page_on_rainforest_destruction.pdf\">published by the Rainforest Action Network</a> in 2010, which offered scientific proof that pulp from endangered trees were turning up in the glossy colour pages of children's books, cookery books and coffee-table style art books.</p> <p>Unlike the other eight publishers, however, Disney initially held out, offering only token changes and dismissing calls from Ran for a broader policy review. Negotiations began in earnest only after Ran activists, dressed as Mickey and Minnie Mouse, <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2011/05/rainforest-action-network-activists-arrested-at-disney-over-paper-protest.html\">chained themselves to the gates of Disney headquarters</a> in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank in May 2011 and erected a huge banner reading \"Disney: Destroying Indonesia's Rainforests\". </p> <p>Within a week of that protest, initially dismissed by Disney as a \"no more than publicity stunt\", a delegation of senior executives had flown to Ran's offices in San Francisco and begun serious negotiations.</p> <p>The problem, according to Robin Averbeck, who has spearheaded Ran's Disney campaign, was that top management did not wake up to the reality of what was going on until the protest encouraged them to take a more careful look. </p> <p>\"Transparency in the supply chain is very challenging. The pulp comes from a forest to a paper mill to a broker to a printer to a supplier to Disney,\" Averbeck said. \"When a company has Disney's enormous global reach, its arms are so long they often don't know what their hands are doing.\"</p> <p>She and other negotiators for Ran said that it didn't take long for senior executives to understand how damaging it could be to Disney's brand to be associated with the destruction of ancient forests, the dwindling of Sumatran tigers and elephants, and a <a href=\"http://ran.org/sites/default/files/ran_whydisneymustacttosaveindonesiarainforests.pdf\">major contribution to global warming</a>. </p> <p>Nailing down a new policy was highly intricate, because of the number of moving parts. Disney products are manufactured in close to 25,000 factories worldwide, about 10,000 of them in China. The new purchasing agreement does not just cover books \u2013 it applies to theme park brochures and cruise ship menus and corporate stationery.</p> <p>Ran has been remarkably successful in challenging big corporations on this issue, largely because of the startling analysis it conducted on a number of paper products in its 2010 study. It commissioned a specialist laboratory in Wisconsin to examine paper samples under a microscope and identify the wood types in the pulp \u2013 the paper industry equivalent of using DNA analysis to draw conclusions from a crime scene.</p> <p>Since then, numerous corporations in and out of publishing \u2013 they include Random House, Pierson/Penguin, Mattel and Tiffany \u2013 have changed their paper purchasing practices. The lone holdout among those identified in the 2010 report as a rainforest menace is HarperCollins, the book publishing division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire, which Ran continues to define as a \"laggard\".</p> <p>HarperCollins began negotiations with Ran, like the other companies, but pulled out for reasons that have never been spelled out publicly. HarperCollins, however, defended its policies, and contested Ran's right to decide whether they meet an appropriate standard. </p> <p>\"We use only acceptable fibre sources, and have worked with printers to eliminate the use of Indonesian fibre,\" company spokeswoman Erin Crum said.</p> <p>Crum held up HarperCollins's UK division as a model for the industry, saying it was one of the first to seek certification from the Forest Stewardship Council and now uses FSC-certified paper in at least 60% of its products.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2012, following a complaint from Asia Pacific Resources International Limited, to take out claims that Disney is severing its ties with two paper producers.</p>",

Not only has it provided a glimpse into the scheduled announcements, events and speeches that make up the news day, but also allows readers to view what our editors think about the stories by reading their updates on Twitter. </p> <p>Readers are given the opportunity to give their views on individual stories and suggest lines of inquiry using Twitter by tweeting to #opennews. </p> <p>The Guardian further extended the idea of openness by inviting thousands of our readers to visit our offices to take part in a huge array of activities spread over two days in March 2012.</p> <p>The Open Weekend not only allowed our readers to engage with some of the big issues facing society, but also to better understand how we create and curate our editorial coverage. Sessions included joining the Guardian's leader writers and political reporters to help shape the leader line and a discussion with Rusbridger as well the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.gmgplc.co.uk/\">Guardian Media Group</a> and the head of <a href=\"http://www.guardiannews.com/\">Guardian US</a> on where the digital revolution may take news organisations.</p> <p>Being open is also at the heart of our multimedia offering with about a third of video views now on our <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/theguardian/\">Guardian Facebook app</a>, which helps us access a large and often new audience.</p> <p>During the UK riots, we showcased user-generated videos to give a very real sense of the atmosphere on the streets. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johndomokos\">John Domokos</a> went into the heart of riots, gathering locals' views and showing our audience the looting and unrest first-hand.</p> <p>To highlight the impact of proposed changes to the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), we asked our users receiving DLA to send us videos of themselves, explaining the importance of this allowance. We received submissions from people suffering from a wide range of conditions, from ME to depression, each explaining how DLA is their lifeline. This set of videos gave a very personal, and powerful, insight into the impact of the proposed changes.</p> <p>This example demonstrates our commitment to using multimedia to combat social injustice. Over 2011-12 we have endeavoured to give a voice to the voiceless, make a difference and engender change in attitudes and policy. We have covered issues in the UK and abroad, ranging from travellers' rights to the death penalty for minors. </p> <p>One film we are particularly proud of is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2011/apr/18/female-genital-mutilation-video\">\"I will never be cut\"</a>. This film gave a voice to two teenage girls living with the threat of female genital mutilation. Fighting against tradition and their parents, they were supported by a local grassroots organisation and narrowly avoided being cut.

  "<p>Banks and miners were among the day's leading gainers as markets moved higher after three days of losses.</p> <p>Despite overnight news that credit agency Standard &amp; Poor's had cut its rating on Spain, and the subsequent speculation of the country requesting a bailout imminently, investors took heart from better than expected US weekly jobless numbers.</p> <p>Banks were boosted by a report from Bloomberg that the tough new Basel rules on their capital could be delayed for a year. <strong>Barclays</strong> was 10.65p better at 232.65p while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong>, fresh from its Direct Line flotation, rose 11.1p to 273.8p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 53.04 points higher at 5829.75p.</p> <p>But <strong>Morrisons</strong> led the FTSE 100 fallers, down 4.5p to 269.5p as analysts expressed concerns about the supermarket group after the latest market share figures.</p> <p>Credit Suisse moved from outperform to neutral, cut its earnings estimates by up to 3% and its price target from 320p to 290p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> After weak first half sales, we thought Morrison needed to get back on form. It hasn't yet. This week's [Kantar Worldpanel] share data suggest further divergence from the market average with August/September worse than the first half. Although management expects negative like for like again for the second half (the first was down 0.9%), we were initially more hopeful. But, following the new data, we have now revised down our expectation of second half like for like to -3.0% from 0.0%. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Espirito Santo, although it still has a buy rating, said:</p> <blockquote> The prolonged underperformance of Morrison is starting to really hurt the company and though there are some explanations (no online offer yet, very few convenience stores so far, lower new store contribution) the fear is that Sir Ken Morrison is right in his conclusion that the new fresh food reformat is just a step too far for Morrison's core customer. Dalton Philips is going to have to turn things around soon. </blockquote> <p><strong>Burberry</strong> bounced 133p to \u00a311.36 after its first half trading update proved better than feared (given its profit warning last month). Kate Calvert at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> The shares have fallen 27% since its September 11th update and is trading on an undemanding 2013 PE of 14.3 times. While there is still uncertainty over the cost of bringing in-house the fragrance license and over the impact the global economic slowdown will have on luxury spending, we are reassured that demand has not fallen off a cliff and so believe the shares have been oversold. We still consider Burberry a strong long term growth story with significant geographical and product mix opportunities. Consequently, we are upgrading our recommendation to buy [from hold]. </blockquote> <p>Utilities were out of favour as investors turned their attention back to riskier assets. <strong>Severn Trent</strong> lost 3p to \u00a316.71 and <strong>United Utilities</strong>, subject of renewed takeover talk on Wednesday, slipped2p to 727p.</p> <p>Elsewhere baker <strong>Greggs</strong> lost 21p to 495.5p after it said in a disappointing update that it expected like for like sales to remain negative in the final quarter, after a 2.6% fall in the previous three months, as consumers continued to tighten their belts.</p> <p><strong>WH Smith</strong> fell 21p to 631p following news that the much admired Kate Swann planned to step down as chief executive next summer.</p> <p>On the speculation front, traders were talking of interest in publishing and exhibitions group <strong>Informa</strong>, up 13.9p at 411.8p, and <strong>Premier Oil</strong>, 20.5p better at 374.7p.</p> <p>Finally fuel cell specialist <strong>AFC Energy</strong> powered ahead nearly 14% to 33.25p after Ervington Investments, whose beneficial owner is Chelsea boss Roman Abramovich, bought a 15% stake for \u00a38.7m.</p>",
  "<p>Female leaders are urgently required within most sectors. In the UK, the FTSE 100 boasts a pitiful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/13/women-absent-board-top-uk-companies\" title=\"\">15% of female directors</a> on boards, while the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/topstories/2011/Feb/women-on-boards\" title=\"\">2011 Davies report</a> set the modest goal of 25% female board member representation by 2015 \u2013 a target that is unlikely to be met. However, arguably no area is in greater need of a diversity of leadership, thinking and insight than sustainability. The challenges of global warming and energy and water shortages mean that carrying on with business as usual, with the same predominantly male leaders, is not an option.</p> <p>Guardian Sustainable Business held a live discussion, in association with <a href=\"http://sxsweco.com/\" title=\"\">SXSW Eco</a>, to explore the role of women leaders in sustainability by focusing on the barriers facing women in business, why female leadership is vital to sustainability and the role all stakeholders have in enhancing gender equality in business.</p> <p>The panel assembled to tackle these issues included: Dianne Dillon-Ridgley, environmentalist and human rights activist on the board of directors at carpet manufacturer Interface; Anna Lapp\u00e9, co-founder of the Small Planet Fund and director of the Real Food Media Project; Judi Marshall, professor of leadership and learning at Lancaster University Management School; Karen Flanders, sustainability practice leader at Wisdom Works Group; Dr Kathy Dhanda, associate professor in the department of management at Dreihaus College of Business at DePaul University.</p> <p>Over two hours, the debate covered the following topics:</p> <p><strong>The need to do things differently</strong></p> <p>Kicking off the debate was the need for female leaders to be at the forefront of innovation within sustainability. Erin Meezan, vice president of Interface, explained that: \"I think women will play an increasingly important role in making the organisational change needed to guide at least the corporate world, if not the world in general\".</p> <p>She explained that this could herald a move towards a new way of doing business that is more collaborative, more community centred and more partnership focused. This, said Meezan, would be a truly stakeholder approach to business.</p> <p>Marshall agreed that this should be the way forward, saying \"I think sustainability has to be a society-level notion \u2013 and practice \u2013 and so people who can think of the wider setting and its needs have much to offer.\"</p> <p><strong>Why do men have all the positions of power?</strong></p> <p>The debate really hotted up with a question from Carmen Alvarez, a Spanish reader, asking why we allow so many men into top jobs in top companies when they \"make decisions without including, listening to and, most importantly, respecting women\". Why, in essence, do we still put up with this macho culture, asked Alvarez.</p> <p>Anna Lapp\u00e9, writing from Boulder, Colorado, responded by saying: \"I wouldn't say that we *allow* men to have so much power, I think that the power imbalance in so many workplaces has to do with a policy culture that makes it very hard for women to gain power, especially in corporations.\"</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 outlined the need for workplace policies that allow people, including men, to balance work and home life. \"Here, you're considered VERY fortunate if you can get even three months maternity\", she wrote.</p> <p>The current risk-averse context of business was also raised by Marshall. The radical change needed is considered too scary and so people look to those with mainstream credentials as leaders, she suggested \u2013 \"and this has traditionally not been many women.\" She name-checked Ray Anderson, the leader of Interface and early sustainability pioneer, as the type of leader that industry still seems more comfortable with.</p> <p>However, Marshall admitted to being perplexed by the ongoing issue of gender imbalance in leadership positions, calling it a \"thorny issue\" that has persisted in several areas since the 1970s without any great strides being made.</p> <p><strong>Women are more affected by sustainability issues</strong></p> <p>While the panellists largely agreed that stressing the differences between genders was often an unproductive part of the debate, there was also a recognition that sustainability issues can have a greater impact on women than men, especially among the world's poor.</p> <p>Dhanda asked fellow contributors: \"Can the case be made that climate change and poor environmental management impacts the world's poor more and in these cases, the burden falls more heavily on women?\" She quoted the Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva as saying that most farmers in India are women and that more women are responsible for feeding families than men.</p> <p>Lapp\u00e9 added that women, especially south of the equator, disproportionately bore the brunt of environmental devastation. Small-scale farmers produced 70% of what the world eats and most of those farmers were women, said Lapp\u00e9. A contributor from the University of Nottingham, genderCSR, also pointed out that women were more likely to be poor and therefore experience inequalities of opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Making the business case for change</strong></p> <p>It can seem striking that a business case still needs to be made for female leaders, but the glacial pace of change in the make-up of board rooms suggests that it does. Meezan stated that this was a business issue, not a diversity issue: \"I think filling sustainability positions has driven some of this for businesses \u2013 it often requires finding a 'different' person and that requires looking at what they can do \u2013 not what their role will be.\" The hiring process was increasingly recognising the need to collaborate and communicate across a wide geography of stakeholders, in some cases over and above technical background, said Meezan.</p> <p>The need for corporate role models and trend setters is clear, and Flanders pointed to action taking place at The Coca-Cola Company where the chairman and CEO \"has made the rise of women's economic and social empowerment in the coming decade and its impact on the global economy, business strategy and sustainability efforts a top priority\".</p> <p>Dhanda added that Joe Folkman, president of Zenger Folkman, noted that \"while men excel in the technical and strategic arenas, women clearly have the advantage in the extremely important areas of people relationships and communication\". This, his research concluded, \"suggests that by adding more women the overall effectiveness of the leadership team would go up\".</p> <p>Meanwhile some parts of the world, namely Scandinavia, were much further ahead when it came to female business leaders, said Dillon-Ridgley. Norway, she said, now requires a 60/40 ratio minimum of board directors. At first there was resistance, but eventually it had become the norm, she said.</p> <p>\"There was much 'hue and cry' but ... they [now] lead the world in gender 'balance' on government legislative bodies as well as heads of government.\"</p> <p>Dillon-Ridgley added: \"From all our comments ... there is clearly not a lack of women's talent.\"</p> <p><em>To read the full discussion, please click </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/women-leaders-sustainability-csr-live-discussion?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><em>Tim Smedley is a freelance features writer for national newspapers and magazines, specialising in work, sustainability and social issues</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><em>One of the most disturbing stories to emerge from the United States Anti-Doping Agency report into Lance Armstrong is the case of David Zabriskie, who now rides for Garmin-Sharp and broke through as the first American to win stages in all three grand tours (France, Italy and Spain).</em></p> <p><em>This is how the Usada report describes his time with US Postal:</em></p> <p>\"In early 2003 David Zabriskie was 23 years old, a young man who had postponed a college education to see what he could make of himself in cycling.</p> <p>He must have felt fortunate to be on Lance Armstrong's US Postal Service Cycling Team.</p> <p>Zabriskie was, no doubt, happy to be walking to a meeting at a cafe in Girona, Spain with the team director, Johann Bruyneel [who has always denied involvement in a drugs programme], team doctor, Luis del Moral, and Zabriskie's room-mate at competitions, and a somewhat older cyclist named Michael Barry.</p> <p>Zabriskie was away from home, a young man in an unfamiliar environment, he did not know Spanish and frequently felt lonely, one of the younger cyclists on a team of hardened professionals.</p> <p>However, on this day one would not have been surprised to find him expectant, hopeful. Zabriskie had recently shown success in the early-season Four Days of Dunkirk, a four-day stage race in which he had finished in a surprising fifth place.</p> <p>The result placed him in front of some well known racers at the time, men like Richard Virenque, Nicolas Jalabert and Laurent Brochard. Zabriskie had been warmly congratulated by the assistant team director and perhaps sensed that Bruyneel might have important plans for him.</p> <p>Bruyneel was respected by Zabriskie whose father had died a few years before, his life shortened by drug addiction. Zabriskie had sought refuge in cycling.</p> <p>Long hard training rides were cathartic and provided an escape from the difficult home life associated with a parent with an addiction. He had vowed never to give in to the temptation to use, never to end up like his father, furtively using drugs to feed his dependency and eroding his physical health.</p> <p>Barry was about five years older than Zabriskie; however, Zabriskie had been on the USPS team a year longer.</p> <p>The group met at or near a cafe, and the conversation proceeded in English. Bruyneel got right to the point. He and Del Moral had brought two injectable products for Zabriskie and Barry, something known as \"recovery\" and the banned oxygen booster, erythropoietin (known as EPO). Zabriskie was shocked.</p> <p>This was the beginning of David's third year on the team and he had not realised he would be required to dope. He realised, of course, that some cyclists in the peloton and likely some team-mates fuelled their success with banned substances. However, until now he had been largely shielded from the reality of drug use on the US Postal Service Team. Zabriskie began to ask questions.</p> <p>He was fearful of the health implications of using EPO, and he had a slew of questions: would he be able to have children? Would it cause any physical changes? Would he grow larger ears?</p> <p>The questions continued. Bruyneel responded, \"everyone is doing it\". Bruyneel assured David that if EPO was dangerous no professional cyclists would be having kids. David was cornered.</p> <p>He had embraced cycling to escape a life seared by drugs and now he felt that he could not say no and stay in his mentor's good graces. He looked to Barry for support but he did not find it. Barry's mind was made up.</p> <p>Barry had decided to use EPO, and he reinforced Bruyneel's opinions that EPO use was required for success in the peloton.</p> <p>The group retired to Barry's apartment where both David and Barry were injected with EPO by Dr Del Moral.</p> <p>Thus began a new stage in David Zabriskie's cycling career \u2013 the doping stage. Cycling was no longer David's refuge from drugs. When he went back to his room that night he cried.\"</p>",
  "<p>In Chinese, Mo Yan means \"don't speak\". It's an odd choice of pseudonym for a writer who has produced 10 novels, several novellas and more than 80 short stories, establishing himself as one of mainland China's best-known authors both in the Chinese-speaking and anglophone worlds.</p> <p>In his 30-year writing career, Mo Yan has gained a reputation for speaking out with uncommon directness on the absurdities and corruption of modern China. Born in 1955, he won celebrity during the mid- to late-80s, participating in two key developments in the post-Mao literary thaw that, together, transformed the imaginative landscapes of mainland writing: the <a href=\"http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-SCSM200803035.htm\" title=\"\">root-seeking</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dukeupress.edu/Catalog/ViewProduct.php?productid=634\" title=\"\">avant-garde</a> movements. The root-seekers opened up fiction to influences from Chinese traditional culture and aesthetics, countering decades of anti-traditionalism both before and after the communist revolution of 1949. The experimental avant-garde writers, meanwhile, released literary form and content from the stranglehold of socialist realism.</p> <p>For three decades, Mo Yan has reeled out colourful historical epics (such as Red Sorghum, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093206/\" title=\"\">adapted for film by Zhang Yimou</a>) set in the wilds of his native north-east China. In the process \u2013 not least in The Garlic Ballads, The Republic of Wine, and Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out \u2013 he has laid bare the grotesquerie and cruelty of communist society since 1949.</p> <p>Mo Yan is notable not only for his creative engagement with modern Chinese history but also, more simply, for his dedication to the craft of writing. As the catchphrase of the market economy-oriented 1990s became \"wang qian kan\" (\"look towards the future\", which, in Chinese, neatly punned the word for \"future\" on the word for \"money\"), many writers who had found fame in the 80s joined in the capitalist free-for-all. Plenty of once-serious novelists shelved literary fiction in favour of profit-making: television and film scripts, song-writing, business ventures. In this febrile cultural context, Mo Yan stands out for his commitment to his literary vocation. He is one of the relatively few contemporary Chinese novelists who has stuck with the form long enough to attain intellectual maturity.</p> <p>Nonetheless, his longer novels have sometimes suffered from the slapdash impatience that runs rife through China's marketised literary economy, often affecting professionalism in both writing and editing. One rumour goes that he is supposed to have written the 500,000-plus characters of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9781611454277/life-and-death-are-wearing-me-out-a-novel\" title=\"\">Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out</a> in 43 days.</p> <p>In many countries, perhaps, a Nobel prize for literature is seen as an award to a creative individual, without any broader, collective symbolism. Not so in China. Since its re-entry into the global political, economic and cultural realm in the early 1980s, China's establishment has craved Nobel prizes in science, economics and (particularly) literature. As part of a broader post-Mao yearning for international prizes and \"face\" (for the Olympics, to qualify for the football World Cup, to enter the World Trade Organisation), Beijing has desired a Nobel for a Chinese person living, working and prospering in China, as nationalistic validation that the People's Republic of China has made it as a modern global power.</p> <p>Ethnically Chinese individuals have achieved Nobels in science and literature in the past, but they were resident outside China at the time of winning. Two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/oct/08/nobel-peace-prize-liu-xiaobo\" title=\"\">the award of the Nobel peace prize to Liu Xiaobo</a> \u2013 a political dissident still serving an 11-year prison sentence for pro-democracy campaigning \u2013 caused Beijing intense embarrassment. Perhaps this prize to Mo Yan \u2013 an active member of communist China's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Federation_of_Literary_and_Art_Circles\" title=\"\">Writers' Association</a> \u2013 will go some way towards resolving the country's Nobel complex.</p>",
  "<p>Lost in Showbiz has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2012/jul/12/fifty-shades-of-peter-andre\" title=\"\">mentioned the publishing sensation of the century before</a>, but it feels impelled to do so again: after all, the global pandemic of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/romance/9780099579939/fifty-shades-of-grey\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades of Grey</a> fever shows no signs of being contained. It confesses it hasn't actually read the trilogy, despite giving it several shots: yes, it's like that business at university with Gravity's Rainbow all over again. Perhaps it was the realisation that its own love life fell so short of the thrilling \"kinky fuckery\" depicted in the book that caused it to toss the book aside while suffering from a temporary collapse of the will to live.</p> <p>But nevertheless, Lost in Showbiz can't help but feel hugely excited by the mini-industry spawned by the book's vast success. Its home regularly rings to the sound of <a href=\"http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/fifty-shades-of-grey-classical-album-coming/051302\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades of Grey: The Classical Album</a>, which, as advertised, \"sets a mysterious and alluring atmosphere \u2026 with just the slightest hint of danger\". Who could fail to be thrilled when considering the forthcoming line of <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/23/entertainment/la-et-ct-fifty-shades-merch-20120622\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades of Grey merchandise</a> described in the LA&#xa0;Times, including stationery items, hosiery, lingerie and accessories. \"Expect to see Christian Grey boxers and ties as well as loungewear, sleepwear and T-shirts; the accessories would comprise bags, wallets, portfolios, key&#xa0;chains and underwear (for men and women).\"</p> <p>Picture the look on your amorata's face when your romantic dinner comes to a close and you settle the bill by whipping out your Fifty Shades of Grey&#xa0;wallet, a look that says: there's a deeply sophisticated gentleman \u2013 I'd like to get to know him better. What could be more likely to conjure a mysterious and alluring atmosphere with just the slightest hint of danger in the bedroom than the donning of a pair of Christian Grey boxer shorts?</p> <p>But LiS is most excited by the imminent arrival of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/08/fifty-shades-of-grey-movie-writers?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades of Grey: the movie</a>. Previously, LiS's favourite suggestion for the leading man's role was Justin Bieber: it thinks of the 18-year-old weenybopper cruising the streets of Los Angeles in his car designed to look like the Batmobile and finds the words \"mysterious and alluring \u2026 with just a hint of danger\" involuntarily forming on its lips. But that was before X Factor songbird Leona Lewis <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/leona-lewis/366253-leona-lewis-fifty-shades-of-grey-chris-brown\" title=\"\">chipped in with her own indispensable thoughts on the matter</a>. \"For Christian Grey it has to be someone really hot and super-smooth,\" she opined, before asking a question. \"Why&#xa0;am I just thinking of Chris Brown?\" LiS has literally no idea why that particular name would spring to mind when thinking about a man who enjoys hitting women, but carry on. And carry on she did. \"Maybe Chris Brown!\" she concluded.</p> <p>Chris Brown! <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2012/sep/13/chris-brown-wanted-mexican-skull\" title=\"\">The World's Favourite Domestic Abuser!</a> That sound you can hear is LiS slapping its forehead in recognition of an idea it wishes it had come up with, then loudly cheering this kind of out-of-the-box, blue-sky thinking. Alas, it fears that our old bugbear the PC Brigade will already be pursing their lips into a cat's-bum of disapproval and saddling up their high horses, suggesting that it's somehow morally repugnant to cast a man convicted of savagely beating his girlfriend in a film about a woman willingly submitting herself to a sadist. How sadly typical.</p> <p>Then again, perhaps it's right that Brown is struck from the list, simply for reasons of patriotism. Has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/author/el-james\" title=\"\">EL James</a> \u2013 or, as LiS still likes to think of her, <a href=\"http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124\" title=\"\">Snowqueens Icedragon</a> \u2013 not given a&#xa0;thought to her homeland, its rich cast&#xa0;of eminently capable actors ready and willing to take on the challenge of bringing her characters to life? Without wishing to sound jingoistic, when it comes to casting Fifty Shades of Grey, LiS is very much rooting for Team GB. Potential names trip off the tongue: Claire Sweeney; Jodie Prenger; For Christian Grey, the list is even longer: Adam Woodyatt; Leigh \"Keith Lemon\" Francis; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/lostinshowbiz/2012/sep/13/danny-dyer-9-11-slags\" title=\"\">Lost In Showbiz's old mate Danny Dyer</a>. If Justin Bieber and Chris Brown are in the frame, then we can cast our net wider still to include the bad boys of pop. Perhaps N-Dubz's Dappy. Or Frankie Cocozza.</p> <p>Indeed, if it's now apparently all right to suggest convicted domestic abusers for the role of Christian Grey, LiS would like to venture one very obvious name: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/09/justin-lee-collins-guilty-harassing\" title=\"\">Justin Lee Collins</a>. Difficult though it is to imagine anyone being capable of rendering the novel's dialogue more dizzyingly erotic than it&#xa0;is on the page, LiS has long felt that the one way you could conceivably add&#xa0;a certain frisson would be to have it delivered in a strong West Country accent: \"Oi'll agree to the fistin', but oi'd really loike to claim yurr arrrrse, Anastasia\"; \"Whaaat a temptin' morsel you aaare\"; \"Oi'm a very wealthy maaaan, Miss Steele, and oi 'ave expensive and absorrrbin' 'obbies\" etc etc.</p> <p>Its mind races to the moment in the trilogy where the female protagonist discusses food. \"'I think we'll eat later,' he says. 'Put the chicken in the fridge.' This is not a sentence I had ever expected to hear from Christian Grey, and only he can make it sound hot, really hot.\" Only him, LiS would suggest, and a man who sounds like he&#xa0;wants you to put the chicken in the&#xa0;fridge because he's off to Ashton Gate to see the Robins take on Huddersfield Town and launch into a&#xa0;rousing chorus of Drink Up Thy Zider. LiS can feel its Inner Goddess rearing up \u2013 and the atmosphere suddenly changing to one of mysterious allure&#xa0;with a hint of danger \u2013 at the very&#xa0;thought.</p>",
  "<p>Wendell Berry doesn't come to New York very often. The 78-year-old lives in Kentucky, where his family has farmed for five generations.</p> <p>When he flies to the city next week, it's to collect a <a href=\"http://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/jbf-names-2012-leadership-award-recipients\">Leadership Award from the James Beard Foundation</a> for over half a century of campaigning for better methods of food production. During his career, Berry has <a href=\"http://wfpl.org/post/wendell-berry-stresses-relationship-land-national-lecture\">demonstrated against</a> everything from Vietnam to nuclear power, from mountain-top coal mining to the death penalty. Most famously, he has campaigned against what he sees as bad farming methods, particularly industrialized farming.</p> <p>\"I'm a writer more than I am a talker,\" he says when I call him prior to his trip. In a life of extraordinary productivity, as well as his campaigning, Berry has authored <a href=\"http://www.wendellberrybooks.com/\">more than 40 books</a> of fiction, poetry and essays \u2013 he is most frequently compared to William Faulkner. And, in 2010, he <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20110302/NEWS01/303020109/Wendell-Berry-receives-humanities-medal-from-Obama\">received</a> the National Humanities Medal.</p> <p>Berry is still a committed activist, arguing these days for a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/opinion/05berry.html\">50-Year Farm Bill</a> to address such deeply unfashionable issues as soil degradation and sustainable agriculture. Here are some of his thoughts on the state of the environment, and how the US, at any given moment, is nearer to a food crisis than most people imagine.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Did you see Roger Cohen's very hostile <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/07/opinion/roger-cohen-the-organic-fable.html\">New York Times op-ed </a>piece about organic food last month?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> He called it the \"the romantic back-to-nature obsession of an upper middle class able to afford it.\" I'd love to know your response to that.</p> <p><strong>WB</strong>: All right. Well, organic has never been a word I have willingly used. My label is just \"good farming\", which isn't something you can put on a t-shirt. My objection to organic is that it has always been defined negatively. That is, in terms of things that you don't do. And I think good agriculture is always going to be defined in terms of things you do do: you make the farm provide as much of its own fertility and operating energy as you can.</p> <p>If you have an organic monoculture of several thousand acres, as I think some California vineyards have, and you're importing all of the fertility, then that's not good farming. I don't care how organic it is.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> And the accusation of elitism?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> That calls for a lot of careful criticism. If we can't afford to take good care of the land that feeds us, we're in an insurmountable mess. And at present, we're not affording it. Cheap food is a great accomplishment of industrialization, but I think <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=K9ea3Ebv7LkC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=Michael+Pollan+While+it+is+true+that+many+people+simply+can%27t+afford+to+pay+more+for+food,+either+in+money+or+time+or+both,+many+more+of+us+can&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wjs-wKBr9s&amp;sig=ebStrQ6o73NozuxpaW0-F4KJaM0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YDh0UPPrJqmJ0AXulYGYCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Michael%20Pollan%20While%20it%20is%20true%20that%20many%20people%20simply%20can%27t%20afford%20to%20pay%20more%20for%20food%2C%20either%20in%20money%20or%20time%20or%20both%2C%20many%20more%20of%20us%20can&amp;f=false\">Michael Pollan</a> makes a very good point: that if people eat healthy food, they will save enough to compensate for the food price being healthier and spending less on healthcare, so-called. For people just to wave good agriculture away as something only an elite can afford \u2013 as if it were some kind of a prissy fashion \u2013 is just missing the whole point.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> That's how the organic movement came to be regarded by its critics: as a lifestyle choice.</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Industrialization advances on the same theme. If you don't have the latest technology, you're out of it. It's largely fashion. The latest technology is not always good for anything except to the producers of the technology.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> How do you get consumers to give more thought to what they're buying in the supermarket? At the end of a long day, that can be a tough sell.</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> They think the way they breathe: they just take in whatever's handiest. Well, this effort I've been involved in all these years has a couple of questions hanging over it. So, you know there's not a mountainous pile of food anywhere that people can draw on if production fails for some reason? Food has to be kept coming; it's more analogous to the flow of blood in our body than to a large bank account that can be drawn upon in an emergency, or an insurance policy. It has to be kept coming. We know how quickly famine could happen in the cities, where people are helpless to do anything for themselves.</p> <p>Look at Phoenix, for instance; a large city in the desert where all the things they need are going to have to be trucked to them. Suppose that became difficult or impossible? People can be persuaded very quickly if there are shortages. Hunger is a powerful persuader if it happens, and it's conceivable that it could happen. Country people have always known this.</p> <p>I'm not exactly dodging your question on how do you persuade consumers: I'm saying that people are persuadable. Persuasion works. Whether it's working fast enough, we don't know. We have to do it because we know it's right.</p> <p>I tell the young: you can't get into this on the assumption that you're going to win, even in your lifetime. You have to get into it because you know it's right and have all the fun you can while you work.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> You can actually envisage severe food shortages occurring in this country? Because farming methods are exhausting the resources?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Yes. People sit around out here in the country and say, what are people going to eat? There's a letter in my local newspaper this morning from a dairy farmer's wife, writing in to say what do people think is going to happen to us? We're buying stuff on an inflated market, and selling our milk for what we sold it four years ago. People like that find it very easy to ask: what are people going to do when we're all gone?</p> <p>We don't know what's going to happen in the future. I'm only saying that we have finite supplies from a finite acreage that we are abusing by erosion, toxicity and so on. And a finite number of producers we are abusing, and there are fewer of them all the time \u2013 fewer than 1% in this country. Their vote doesn't matter to anybody.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> What would you like the role of government to be in all of this?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> I'd like to see the subsidies to big industrial agriculture stop. The government could make soil conservation a priority, which would act as a kind of permission-giver to people to take it seriously. No one is talking about the land economy at all. The economists I read in the newspapers and magazines: it never occurs to them to speak of it.</p> <p>Paul Krugman, for instance, thinks that the economy is the same thing as the financial system. And he couldn't be more wrong. So, the first thing people have to do is examine their own economies and see how little control they have over it in terms of quantity and quality.</p> <p>The next thing is, you've got to change the standard. The industrial standards are productivity and profitability. And people like <a href=\"http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-a-livable-future/research/polly_walker_fund/\">Sir Albert Howard</a> [English botanist and organic farming pioneer], J Russell Smith and Liberty Hyde Bailey said, on good scientific grounds, that the standard has to be ecological. The standard has to be health. To put it in more practical terms: you have to use the land in a way that doesn't do more permanent damage to the local ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>EB: </strong>I think that, for many, the assumption is that the only way to provide enough food for a country this size is through industrial methods.</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> But that's exploiting ignorance. Plus, you have the reluctance of the genetic engineers to label food. They need people to be ignorant.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> How would you change labeling laws in the US?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> If a manufactured food or even a singular food product has genetic engineering involved in its production, then there ought to be a label that says so. That's not too hard. There's a terrific fight in this country to keep that from happening. And this is simply an acknowledgement that we want the consumer to be ignorant.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Has Obama had a sympathetic ear to these arguments?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Well, in the political climate that we now have, nobody is going to put soil conservation or the land economy at the top of their list. If Obama did that now, he'd go down as a kook. He could do it if he gets elected again. But what we need is politicians who are willing to educate the public, even at the cost of losing an election.</p> <p><strong>EB:</strong> Has Michelle Obama's White House garden had some symbolic value?</p> <p><strong>WB:</strong> Oh, yes, I think that has some symbolic value and some force. She's given that conversation a public status that it didn't have before. She's helped. There's no question of that. That little old garden up there on the White House lawn has some authentic historical significance, probably. She's come out for physical health. She can do that because she's not running for office. I imagine her husband has to distance himself from that.</p> <p>We wrap up the conversation and I ask Berry for his email address, to which he replies, \"I don't have a computer. I have a solar collector; three panels,\" and laughs loudly.</p> <p>He is honoured to be receiving the James Beard Foundation award, he says, but the city can be a chore. He really does prefer to go his own way.</p> <p>\"I can't hear,\" he says, \"in the midst of a crowd.\"</p>",
  "<p>Discovery of oil off the southwest cost of Ireland has prompted talk of it being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/irish-oil-find-bigger-providence-resources\" title=\"\">great news for the Irish economy</a>. It could certainly do with some. But the announcement that known oil reserves are commercially recoverable is unlikely to offer any great boon to the economy as a whole. There may be a bonanza, but it will be only for a small coterie of Irish banking, property and oil tycoons who continue to benefit from the state's largesse while most of the population struggles in the fifth consecutive year of economic slump.</p> <p>There is a long history of pillage of Ireland's natural resources, beginning with England's deforestation of the country for its navy. More recently, domestic politicians have continued that trend. The disgraced former energy minister <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0124/burker.html\" title=\"\">Ray Burke</a> was in office when Fianna F\u00e1il granted extraordinarily favourable oil exploration licences to oil companies. The former head of Enterprise Energy Ireland, Brian O'Cathain, is reported to have said that some oil developers, such as Shell, will pay no royalties at all for the lucrative <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrib_gas_project\" title=\"\">Corrib field</a>, worth up to \u20ac10bn, and elected representatives have called on the current Fine Gael/Labour party coalition government to <a href=\"http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/38146/opposition-tds-demand-reversal-of-corrib-gas-pipeline-consents\" title=\"\">reverse the deal</a>, so far without success.</p> <p>The troika of EU, IMF and European Central Bank have insisted that Irish taxpayers bail out bondholders in failed Irish banks even while the domestic economy continues to contract. The domestic troika, Fine Gael, Fianna F\u00e1il and Labour, continue to insist there is no alternative.</p> <p>Providence Resources, which made the recent announcement about the oil reserves, also benefits from exceptionally low tax rates and the facility to write any exploration costs against tax. It is like being reimbursed for buying lottery tickets until one or more is a winner. Except that finding oil in Ireland's offshore has long been a certainty, and the elevated price of oil now makes <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443749204578047842645557974.html\" title=\"\">exploration highly profitable</a>.</p> <p>The chief executive of Providence, Tony O'Reilly Jr, explicitly hopes to emulate the British experience. This seems unlikely for two reasons. The tax rates for North Sea oil at the time of commercial exploitation ranged from 50% to 75%, and the major oil companies in Britain, such as BP, also owned \"downstream\" businesses of refining and selling oil commercially, which protected them against fluctuations in the oil price. In contrast, without the necessary investment in refineries, the virtually untaxed developers in Irish waters <a href=\"http://irishoilandgas.wordpress.com/2012/10/10/oreilly/#more-521\" title=\"\">may not even bring the oil onshore to Ireland</a>.</p> <p>But the North Sea oil boom under Thatcher is hardly a model of sustainable growth. Then, government oil revenues allowed an earlier version of austerity (then labelled \"monetarism\") to be followed by tax cuts and the profligacy of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawson_Boom\" title=\"\">Lawson boom</a>\". Now that Britain is once more an oil importer, latter-day Thatcherites who imagine the Tory triumphs of the 1980s can be repeated are living in a fantasy. There is no positive legacy for Britain of the North Sea oil boom.</p> <p>This week's events show another model is possible. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/hugo-chavez-election-press-conference\" title=\"\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's victory</a> marks him as one of the few leaders anywhere to be re-elected since the global economic crisis began. Venezuela has had very large oil revenues for decades, but only since his government took control of the industry, away from foreign multinationals and local oligarchs, has the wealth it creates been distributed among the population. Unlike Ireland, and all the countries implementing \"austerity\", poverty in Venezuela is declining, healthcare and education improving and the economy is growing. If Ireland is to benefit from an oil boom it needs to look to Ch\u00e1vez, not to Thatcher.</p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of poor Indian farmers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/oct/02/india-landless-march-justice-in-pictures\" title=\"\">marching on Delhi to press their right to land</a> have called off their protest after the government bowed to some of their demands.</p> <p>About <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/rural-india-march-delhi-landless-poor?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">60,000 marchers, mainly socially marginalised dalits and tribal people, began the 350km march from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh to Delhi last week</a>, on the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's birth, inspired by the independence leader's own tactics. They were due to reach the capital this month.</p> <p>The mass protest was called off on Thursday after Jairam Ramesh, the rural development minister, signed a 10-point plan in front of marchers at Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Marchers had been demanding legislation to deal with the speedy resolution of land disputes, which involves fast-tracking such cases through courts. In what marchers considered a key concession, the government has agreed to establish a taskforce to review existing programmes and \"take concrete action\".</p> <p>The taskforce is due to meet next week to prepare a roadmap for land reform in India. PV Rajagopal, the veteran activist who organised the <em>yatra</em> (pilgrimage), warned that if there was no draft legislation in six months to meet the demands, the marchers would resume their protest from where they left off but, instead of 60,000, there would be 100,000.</p> <p>The march was organised by <a href=\"http://www.ektaparishad.com/\" title=\"\">Ekta Parishad</a>, a social movement working on land rights, which mobilised 2,000 civil society groups around the country to provide marchers. \"This year's march built on the successes of one held previously [in 2007] when the national land reform committee was established, but they never met to put an agenda in place,\" said Anand Kumar, country manager in India for Christian Aid, which works with Ekta Parishad.</p> <p>\"This time these negotiations must continue between the government and organisations working with the landless poor. Institutional arrangements must be put in place, and sufficient time and resources allocated to put this agreement into action. Access to land is critical for the eradication of poverty. We hope that today's success will give hope and inspire other land struggles in other parts of the world.\"</p> <p>Before the march Rajagopal had told the Guardian that his intention was not to \"pressurise\" the government. \"The government have gone out of track and need to be brought back. The government should intervene as a referee between poor people and industrialists [who want their land]. Currently I have a problem with the way the government behaves,\" he said.</p> <p>Marchers had said they would \"go to Delhi\" and remain there until their demands had been met. The demonstration was a serious concern for the ruling Congress party, which has long drawn support from the rural poor. Their votes will be crucial in elections due in 2014. Ramesh travelled to Gwalior in a bid to persuade the marchers to abandon their plans.</p> <p>One issue for the Congress party is that the vast flagship subsidy programmes designed to ensure basic levels of nutrition and employment among India's very poor \u2013 and to gain their votes \u2013 are riddled with graft and inefficiency. Hugely expensive, these programmes often fail to reach the most needy.</p> <p>A key problem is documentation. \"We want proper deeds. We have cleared the land, we have worked it. It should be ours,\" said Amini Narayan, an activist from the southern state of Kerala. New legislation aiming to simplify the complex and archaic land laws in India, and ensure fairer compensation for those displaced by new infrastructure projects or industry, has been stuck in parliament and is unlikely to be passed soon.</p>",
  "<p>Six global powers will launch a diplomatic drive after the US elections aimed at defusing the Iranian nuclear crisis in the next few months and avoiding the eruption of a new Middle East conflict next year.</p> <p>A \"reformulated\" proposal will offer limited relief from existing sanctions and other incentives for Iran to limit the level of enrichment of its uranium stockpile. An attempt will be made to sequence the steps required to reach a deal to overcome the mutual distrust that helped sink previous rounds of negotiations, where each side appeared to wait for the other to make the first major concession.</p> <p>\"We recognise that the Iranians need something more with which they can sell a deal at home, and we will expect real change on the other side. It is about getting the sequencing right. That is what this next round will be about,\" a European official said.</p> <p>\"If Iran is prepared to do enough, sanctions will be on the table,\" another western diplomat said. \"It shouldn't expect [the six-power group] to blink first \u2013 but if it's ready to take genuine steps we're ready to respond. This could include sanctions relief \u2013 but only for the right moves by Iran. Sanctions are biting in Tehran and we're not going to lift them without making solid progress on our concerns.\"</p> <p>If the step-by-step approach fails there could be an attempt to \"go big\" with an ambitious, comprehensive settlement that would allow Iran to continue producing uranium at low levels (under 5%) of enrichment but under stricter international monitoring and controls.</p> <p>\"Currently we are stalled because Iran is asking too much and offering nothing in return. One way forward might be for Iran to offer much more and make an accordingly bigger demand at the same time,\" the western diplomat said. Officials involved in the nuclear talks believe there is a window of opportunity for diplomacy between the US elections on 6 November and next spring, with a resumption of high level talks between the group of six powers (the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China) with the Iranian chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, in late November or December.</p> <p>\"Elections obviously mean there's a great deal of uncertainty, but there will be more clarity after November and clearly that's an opportunity,\" one western diplomat said. Britain will be represented at the talks by Mark Sedwill, formerly the UK's special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, who has been named the new political director of the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Much will hinge on the outcome of next month's presidential elections. The plan assumes that either Barack Obama wins a second term, or that Mitt Romney wins but allows the diplomatic initiative to go forward unchanged. If a victorious Romney insists on a full policy review after taking office, the nuclear diplomacy could be derailed for months.</p> <p>Diplomats who took part in the last abortive round of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18481827\" title=\"\">high-level talks in Moscow in June</a> said Jalili made it clear that Iran did not think it was worth negotiating seriously until it was known who the US president would be next year. Western officials also believe that the devastating effect of new energy and banking sanctions made Tehran readier to engage in substantive bargaining.</p> <p>\"Their economy is falling about their ears, so we think they are rather more willing to engage now than in Moscow,\" a European diplomat said.</p> <p>In an effort to ratchet up the pressure, European foreign ministers are due to meet in Luxembourg on Monday to agree a further tightening of sanctions, imposing bans on more Iranian banks and closing loopholes in shipping restrictions imposed in the summer.</p> <p>The diplomatic opening is expected to close again in the spring, as the Iranian leadership is likely to be distracted by the campaign for the country's own presidential elections in June.</p> <p>Iranian politics is just one of the clocks ticking on the new diplomatic initiative. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/binyamin-netanyahu-iran-nuclear-programme\" title=\"\">warned at the UN general assembly last month</a> that the Iranian nuclear programme would reach Israel's \"red line\" by \"next spring, at most by next summer\", implying that Israel might then take military action in a bid to destroy Iranian nuclear sites and set back the programme.</p> <p>That red line, which Netanyahu illustrated at the UN with a marker pen on a ~picture of a bomb, is defined by Iranian progress in making 20%-enriched uranium, which would be much easier than 5% uranium to turn into weapons-grade fissile material should Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, take the strategic decision to \"break out\" from Iran's observance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to try to make a weapon. Tehran insists it has no such intention.</p> <p>A report published this week by the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington said that if Iran tried to break out now, it would take its centrifuge plants between two and four months to make enough weapons-grade uranium for a single warhead. As Iran builds up its 20% uranium stockpile, the ISIS report said a breakout could take less than one month, giving Israel and the west much less time to respond and increasing the chance of a pre-emptive strike.</p> <p>However, it would take several times longer to build even a small nuclear arsenal, and Iran itself has set back that timetable by converting about a third of its 20% stockpile into oxide fuel, which would be harder to turn into weapons-grade material.</p> <p>The 20%-enriched uranium stockpile would be at the heart of the new diplomatic effort. In Moscow meeting in June, the six-nation group of negotiators proposed that Iran should stop producing it, ship its stockpile of almost 200kg out of the country and shut its underground centrifuge plant in Fordow where much of it is made.</p> <p>In return, Iran would be given fuel plates to use in its Tehran medical research reactor (for which it says it requires the 20% uranium), help with nuclear safety, and spare parts for civilian airliners which are currently under sanctions.</p> <p>In return, Jalili presented an uncompromising document which called for all sanctions to be lifted with no let-up in Iranian enrichment. \"Their ideas are a non-starter from an American perspective,\" a senior US administration official said.</p> <p>However, several US analysts criticised the west's negotiating stance at Moscow, arguing Iran had no incentive to offer concessions on enrichment when there was no prospect of relief from punishing sanctions.</p> <p>\"The offer of airplane parts was an insult,\" said George Perkovich, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He said that for a deal to stick, Khamenei had to retain the capacity to restart uranium enrichment at the underground site at Fordow as a form of insurance in case the west broke its side of the bargain. \"The supreme leader is absolutely convinced that the US will renege, so what is his leverage? It has to be Fordow. He has to be sure he can go back to Fordow and crank it up.\"</p> <p>Western officials said that at a meeting in Istanbul in July, experts from Iran and the six-nation group discussed compromise options for stopping production at Fordow in a way that would also allow it to be restarted. They insist that it was privately made clear to Jalili in Moscow that significant sanctions relief would follow if Iran showed a readiness to compromise on 20% enrichment, but some now acknowledge that a more concrete offer needs to be made for Jalili to be able to \"sell\" the deal to Iran's supreme leader.</p> <p>Jim Walsh, an expert on the Iran nuclear programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said: \"This period between the US elections and the Iranian elections is the last best chance to turn this thing around\u2026 I think the Iranians are ready and the Americans are ready. It's a question of the whether the optics and politics can be made to line up this time.\"</p>",
  "<p>Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/09/binyamin-netanyahu-early-election-israel\" title=\"\">is running for a second re-election</a> \u2013 something that no Israeli leader has achieved since <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/israel_at_50/profiles/81279.stm\" title=\"\">David Ben-Gurion</a>, the country's founding father. On Tuesday, Netanyahu announced an early election in January, which he will almost surely win. His centre-left rivals are too disorganised, unpopular, or inexperienced, while the ruling rightwing block enjoys a stable majority in opinion polls.</p> <p>In his campaign-launching televised address, Netanyahu put \"ensuring that Iran will not have a nuclear bomb\" atop his agenda. He made similar declarations before the previous election, in February 2009. Keeping Iran in the headlines serves Bibi's political goals: he appears to be the only possible leader with enough experience, authority and diplomatic skill to deal with the issue. If Iran is the key problem, Netanyahu is the obvious solution.</p> <p>The recent weeks' global debate about whether Israel would, or should, attack Iran's nuclear installations was a successful prelude to Netanyahu's campaign. Other politicians have little to say about Iran, or they fear to appear soft if they criticise the government's sabre-rattling. In reality, Netanyahu's Iran policy has been a failure. Even by his own account at a recent UN speech, the Iranians are ever closer to the bomb. The public doesn't care, however. There is little appetite for going to war now, or alone. According to successive polls, most Israelis would like to see America's air power, rather than Israel's, bombing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_facilities_in_Iran#Natanz\" title=\"\">Natanz</a>.</p> <p>Netanyahu praises himself for the \"stability\" in Israel throughout his current term. Indeed, his cabinet will have served for four years, more than any Israeli government since 1981. The economy was only mildly scratched by the global financial crisis, although it shows signs of recession. There were fewer terrorist attacks and cross-border fire exchanges than during the previous decade, thanks to Bibi's restraint.</p> <p>Netanyahu has shown considerable diplomatic skill facing the Arab spring revolutions. He may have viewed the fall of Hosni Mubarak as a catastrophe, but he has been careful to avoid a public feud with Egypt's current president, Mohamed Morsi, despite their deep ideological rift, knowing that do to otherwise would endanger the peace treaty. He has stayed away from the Syrian civil war, despite the risk of spillover \u2013 directly or via Lebanon. Most importantly from his standpoint, he has leveraged the western fear of regional chaos to his political advantage, by pushing aside the Palestinian issue and American calls to halt West Bank settlements.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/21/netanyahu-rejects-obama-1967-borders\" title=\"\">Netanyahu's public disagreements with Obama</a> over the settlements and Iran, and his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/binyamin-netanyahu-gambles-on-mitt-romney\" title=\"\">open preference for Mitt Romney</a>, don't hurt him at home. Throughout his political career, Netanyahu has been at his best when standing up to the powers that be, at home or abroad. His rightwing base loves it, and the current term has been no different. Paradoxically, Obama's opposition to war against Iran helps Bibi avoid a risky military adventure, while giving him an excuse for not fulfilling his pledge to stop the Iranian bomb.</p> <p>Netanyahu's adherence to the status quo prevented him from dealing with Israel's deeper problems \u2013 the prolonged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/31/israeli-spending-west-bank-settlements\" title=\"\">occupation of the West Bank</a>, with its moral and strategic burden, and the demographic shift in the Israeli society, which has deepened its already existing tribalism.</p> <p>The Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews are currently exempt from military service and under-employed; to sustain economic growth and mitigate domestic rifts, Israel must integrate them into the workforce and give them opportunities. But it comes with a political price tag, since both groups reject the idea of \"Jewish democratic state\" as an oxymoron, and Bibi has failed to present an updated, all-encompassing national ethos. Instead, he has stuck to the old rightwing formula of bashing the Arabs and paying off the ultra-Orthodox, while alienating the shrinking secular mainstream that serves in the army and pays taxes. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/14/netanyahu-coalition-split-draft-orthodox\" title=\"\">draft debate</a> ignited the chain of events leading to the early snap election, which Netanyahu hopes to win before his rivals have time to organise.</p> <p>And here lies Netanyahu's ultimate failure: he offers little hope to the young, educated Israelis, beyond war with Iran, entrenchment on the borders and austerity budgets. This leads to a quiet, but dangerous, brain drain. Unfortunately for Israel, there is no credible candidate in the coming election who offers a brighter future.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article are set to remain open for 24 hours from the time of publication but may be closed overnight</p>",

  "<p>The London <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics-2012\" title=\"\">Olympics</a> and Paralympics may have caused a dip in foreign visitors coming to Britain yet those who did come spent more than usual, figures suggested on Thursday.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics</a> said 3 million came during August, a 5% fall on the same month in 2011, but spending including Games tickets bought before or during their visit was 9% up, an all-time monthly record of \u00a32.38bn being injected into the UK economy.</p> <p>Businesses and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/09/uk-tourist-attractions-plunge-visitor\" title=\"\">tourist attractions blamed falling trade during London 2012</a>, saying predictions of overcrowding and travel chaos had put off visitors. There was also no mass exodus of Britons on holidays abroad during August, the 7.3m trips outside the UK was about the same as the previous year.</p> <p>During July and August an estimated 590,000 visitors indicated that they had come to the UK to either attend a ticketed event, participate or work at the Games. These visitors spent about \u00a3760m while in the country, on average spending \u00a31,290, almost double what visitors would normally spend, according to the national tourist agency <a href=\"http://www.visitbritain.com/en/GB/\" title=\"\">VisitBritain</a>, which said it had expected a drop in numbers.</p> <p>Sanie Dawe, its chief executive, said: \"The extraordinary exposure Britain received during the Games has provided us with an ideal platform to remind people around the world why a visit to Britain is a must, and we are working hard to deliver a strong finish to the year.\"</p> <p>Figures overall for the first eight months of 2012 showed similar numbers of visitors to the UK to last year. Their spending was 3% up.</p> <p>Howard Archer, an economist for analysts <a href=\"http://www.ihs.com/products/global-insight/index.aspx\" title=\"\">IHS Global Insight</a>, told Reuters news agency the weakness in the global economy might have also been a reason for the fall in tourist numbers.</p> <p>\"While the impact of the Olympic Games and the Paralympics on the number of overseas visitors coming to the UK in August may be open to differing interpretations, it is evident that the Games did boost spending by overseas visitors to the UK,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>This week's announcement that at least <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/09/us-eurozone-idUSBRE8980UC20121009\" title=\"\">11 European countries</a> will press ahead with a financial transaction tax has barely registered with the UK media, whose gaze was fixed firmly on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/boris-johnson-unfit-to-be-prime-minister\" title=\"\">BoJo show</a> in Birmingham. But it could prove a significant milestone in the quest for a <a href=\"http://robinhoodtax.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Robin Hood tax</a> to ensure that banks pay their fair share to repair the damage done by the economic crisis both here and in poor countries.</p> <p>At a time when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19865692\" title=\"\">George Osborne was insisting on a further \u00a310bn</a> in cuts to the safety nets of the UK poor, the European 11 \u2013 which includes the big economies of Germany, France, Italy and Spain \u2013 were lining up to give a clear message that it is time finance worked in the interests of society rather than the other way around.</p> <p>Despite increasingly negative rhetoric, the official position of the prime minister and his chancellor remains that they favour a global FTT but that introducing such a tax without the US would mean the City of London and therefore the UK economy would lose out. This is wrong on a number of counts.</p> <p>First, a number of the world's leading financial centres already have FTTs. Indeed our very own \"stamp duty\" on share transactions raises about \u00a33bn a year for the Treasury. Hong Kong \u2013 to take another example \u2013 already taxes derivative transactions. Neither has forfeited its star status.</p> <p>More prosaically, the likely design of the European tax means it will be paid by City institutions despite the UK's refusal to sign up. The tax will apply to any transactions on shares, bonds and derivatives where one of the parties to the transaction is based in a country where the tax is introduced. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young estimate that, depending on the final number of countries that sign up, <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/economy/tuc-20596-f0.cfm\" title=\"\">City institutions will still be liable for up to \u00a321bn in tax</a>. But rather than this being paid into our Treasury, it will go instead to governments on the continent.</p> <p>In an age when austerity is failing to bring the public finances under control it is hard to imagine a more spectacular own goal than imperfectly protecting City fat cats at vast expense to the public purse.</p> <p>This is a policy that would not only raise billions, but help curb casino capitalism and particularly the computer-driven high-frequency trading that is contributing to worrying instability in world markets. That's why <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8448862/Robin-Hood-tax-backed-by-more-than-1000-economists.html\" title=\"\">a thousand economists</a> and <a href=\"http://robinhoodtax.org.uk/latest/more-50-financiers-back-robin-hood-tax\" title=\"\">50 leading financiers</a> wrote to David Cameron and other world leaders calling for an FTT, and why it is supported by Bill Gates, George Soros and Warren Buffet.</p> <p>Certainly it offers an opportunity you would expect Labour to enthusiastically seize. There is enormous grassroots support for the Robin Hood tax among the Labour party rank and file, as well as Labour MPs. It is hugely popular with the British public. Yet despite some warm words and a mention in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-uk-infrastructure\" title=\"\">Ed Balls's conference speech</a>, the party's leadership remains little more than a fairweather fan, unwilling to shift its position that an FTT would not work without the US.</p> <p>For now, the new \"one nation\" party remains disproportionately wary of a single square mile. But real progress in Europe could be a game changer. Can you imagine the Labour party going into the next election vowing to remain outside a European Robin Hood tax that has elsewhere reined in the markets and raised billions to kickstart economic progress? The two Eds need to live up to their admirable rhetoric on responsible capitalism and back a Robin Hood tax.</p> <p>And never mind Labour, if Europe gets its FTT right, this government will find it increasingly difficult to justify why it insists on transferring billions of pounds in tax revenue to Paris and Berlin. This is a tax whose time has come.</p>",
  "<p>The recent advances in human-to-computer interaction should be scrambling your brain if you're paying attention at all. From gesture interfaces (both 2D <em>and</em> 3D) to a flood of location-aware social media we're changing the shape and size of and our relationship to the global network.</p> <p>Whereas I grew up in an era where we had to work relatively hard to get a computer to behave the way we wanted, kids today will grow up expecting computers to respond to them instead.</p> <p>Gaming consoles have been leading in this area for years, but now Google, Amazon, <a href=\"http://tech2.in.com/news/accessories/sony-may-showcase-new-augmented-reality-headset-at-tgs-2012/431882\" title=\"\">Sony</a> and even the <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/europe/telefonica-bets-on-augmented-reality-with-aurasma-tie-in\" title=\"\">telcos</a> all have relevant projects starting to ship now.</p> <p>Google, for example, just unveiled a new project called <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.scout\" title=\"\">Field Trip</a> to add to its portfolio of location-responsive media that also includes <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/now/\" title=\"\">Google Now</a> and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/+projectglass/posts\" title=\"\">Google Glass</a>.</p> <p>Content will be sourced from dozens of content partners including Architizer, Eater, Flavorpill, Remodelista and Songkick.<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/09/google-field-trip/\" title=\"\"> Michael Calore tested the new guide for Wired</a>. His verdict:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's a mix of the tantalizing and the trivial. But overall, I think it's filled with enough useful stuff for visitors to get their bearings. If you're pickier than me, you can upvote or downvote each item it serves, which supposedly helps tune the recommendation engine.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>What kind of publisher is well-suited for a world where technology responds to the way a person is moving their body and where they are located at any given moment?</p> <p>What does it mean for information to respond to the way we move our hands, the way we slide our fingers across a glass surface, where our eyes are focused, and which direction we're facing?</p> <p>What does it mean for information to respond to our location, places we've been and places we're going?</p> <p>How do you make information more physical?</p> <p>I wouldn't presume to have the answers, but there are some obvious ways to re-factor current assets and processes in order to get invited to the party.</p> <p>\u2022 Atomise everything. Separate independent elements and link them intelligently. Well-structured information and consistent workflow help a lot with this.</p> <p>\u2022 Add a concept of time and space to media. Location can be a point on the planet, a place, a geopolitical boundary. And time can be a moment or a period.</p> <p>\u2022 Standardise around formats that software developers like to work with. Offer APIs that can accept data as well as release data.</p> <p>It's about adjusting, being malleable and responding. Information, how it's collected, where it goes, and how it is experienced needs to adjust according to the way the user is looking at it and touching it. It needs to synch with where in space and time the person is focused and interested.</p> <p>More simply, make everything you do as software-friendly as you possibly can. And then go partner with people whose brains and financial incentives are inextricably linked to the new hardware and software.</p> <p>If your strategy as a publisher in all this is to play the fast-follower, it's worth remembering that less was at stake in the past. Ten years ago the other publishing forms were still very healthy financial engines and the wait-and-see strategy was a sensible approach for many. Wait-and-see can be sensible for some today, too, but looking at previous transitions in publishing technology may put it in perspective.</p> <p>By 1990, the CDROM market was four years from its peak and five from its crash, but it was nearly too late to get anything out of it. Microsoft was launching Windows 3.0 bringing Apple's innovations to everyone with a computer, MacroMind, Broderbund, the encyclopedia publishers and a whole hardware and software vendor ecosystem had already played out.</p> <p>By 1998, when Page and Brin changed the name of their web search concept from BackRub to Google, DoubleClick had gone already public, Amazon dominated books online and was moving into other retail areas, and the open source Apache web server market share was too strong for Microsoft to overcome. There was more room for newcomers than the CDROM market had at a comparable point in its trajectory, but, again, certain corners of the market had already been locked down.</p> <p>If you get the timing wrong on ubiquitous connectivity and information physicality then you may be entering at a moment when whoever is going to win has already won, or, perhaps worse, when everyone who wants to play is forced to watch from the bench.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

In this very organ, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/sep/03/morrissey-simon-armitage-interview\" title=\"\">the miserabilist rocker told poet Simon Armitage</a> that the Chinese were a \"subspecies\" because of the way they treated animals.</p> <p>But American satirical TV host <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iprVhXuEyg&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">Stephen Colbert's five-minute gem</a> on Tuesday tops the lot. It's a classic example of the interviewer as irritant \u2013 TV death by a thousand gentle prods and pokes. Pop's very own Dorothy Parker (responsible for bon mots such as \"I do maintain that if your hair is wrong, your entire life is wrong\" and \"I don't even know if I exist offstage\"), is reduced to a wobbling jelly of confusion.</p> <p>Morrissey starts out in typical form. Colbert describes him as a living legend known for his melancholy lyrics. Mozza looks at him, tight-lipped and fabulously disapproving. You know he's going to lecture him. He asks Colbert if he knows what the word legend means.</p> <p>\"It means you're dead\" Colbert says.</p> <p>\"No, it means it might be true and it might be false so it doesn't really apply.\" One nil to Morrissey. Or so he thought. It's at this point that Colbert goes to town on Manchester's greatest misanthrope. The technique is simple. Find out what somebody passionately believes in, and pretend you think they believe the opposite. So in this case Colbert takes the titles of two great Smiths albums as his starting point; The Queen Is Dead and Meat Is Murder, and stands them on their head.</p> <p>\"Did you enjoy the Queen's jubilee, such a glorious celebration?\"</p> <p>\"A celebration of what?\" the existential crooner replies, sardonically.</p> <p>\"Sixty years of majesty,\" Colbert says.</p> <p>Morrissey: \"Sixty years of dictatorship.\"</p> <p>Colbert: \"Sixty years of dictatorship, what are you talking about?</p> <p>Didn't you like the pageantry?\"</p> <p>Morrissey: \"No, no, sorry, no, no, no, no.\"</p> <p>\"But she's your queen!\" Colbert protests, whining like a young if better dressed Woody Allen. (The whole interview could be re-imagined as classic Woody Allen circa Annie Hall; Morrissey is the girl Woody loves but can't stop picking fights with.)</p> <p>Every time Colbert changes subject, it inflames the situation. \"You had to love the royal wedding,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I hated the royal wedding,\" Morrissey replies. \"They are absolutely horrible people. Arrogant horrible dictators.\" So by pressing the buttons, Colbert has already got a great quote out of the man still famous for singing with a tree poking out of his backside.</p> <p>And on it goes.</p> <p>Colbert: \"You're not going to say Pippa didn't look lovely?\"</p> <p>Morrissey: \"She's \u2026 horrendous\" Colbert: \"What are you talking about? You couldn't have pulled off that dress.\"</p> <p>Morrissey: \"Of course a few weeks later she's in a gun scandal in Paris and the press hide it completely.\" So Colbert has egged him on to another controversy with a conspiracy theory chucked in for good measure.</p> <p>Having milked the royals, Colbert gently leads him to the butcher's.</p> <p>\"You are a militant vegetarian.\"</p> <p>Morrissey nods proudly.</p> <p>\"You requested, no demanded, this be a meat-free environment for the day you are here.\" Again wonderful interviewing. Colbert exposes Morrissey's ridiculous rider, and brings a conversation that started with Morrissey protesting about dictatorship to a lovely circular close.</p> <p>But not before he comes over all Salvador Dal\u00ed on Morrissey.</p> <p>Do you really believe we can never eat animals, he asks. Exactly, Morrissey says. \"What about a cow that's been sentenced to death for murder or a pig that commits suicide from listening to too many of your songs?\"</p> <p>All Morrissey can do is chide the audience for laughing, and throw fey mock punches at the interviewer. Priceless.</p>",
  "<p>\"When you're having to find a home for someone so they don't spend the night on the streets, the last thing you think about is whether your website looks good or if it's accessible,\" explains John Heath, who is the CEO of a Morecambe-based charity called <a href=\"http://www.signposts.org.uk/index.html\">Signposts</a>. \"We know it's important especially for our funding but in the end you always have more urgent stuff to do.\" This is where the kind-hearted coders and designers of the north come in.</p> <p>Over a warm autumn weekend in Manchester, around 20 designers, coders and lovers of all things techie gathered to share their skills with three local community projects - for free. The <a href=\"http://www.goodfornothing.com/\">'Good for Nothing' weekender</a> which took place <a href=\"http://madlab.org.uk/\">at Madlab</a> last week, aims to help community projects build their profile and equip them for an increasingly competitive funding market.</p> <p>Signposts was set up to help the people of Morecambe 18 years ago, dealing with issues such as homelessness, poverty, mental health issues and everything in between. Their clients range from young children to pensioners. This broad remit of responding to community needs often means that they struggle to promote themselves effectively. In the past, this didn't really matter as their core funding was provided for, but now they are having to join the fast-paced world of bidding for funds.</p> <p>Sharon Calverley, director of operations at Signposts, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's all gone from grant funding to commissioning. This means we're having to bid for funding from people who know absolutely nothing about us or the work you've been doing in the community for decades. And whereas before we would have the morning to the talk to the funder about who we are and the work we do, now we're lucky to get more than half an hour of their time. So, we need to be able to make an impression really quickly, which is why things like the video are really important</p> </blockquote> <p>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-429792405\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349948099199/signposts.jpg\" alt=\"signposts\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Calverley explains her challenges and problems to the team.

Calverley says:</p> <blockquote> <p>I've always been a little cynical about all this media stuff but getting their help has really made me see the value it can bring. The video they made for us today is just perfect - it brought together 18 years of hard work into a 5 minute video.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>So, what is it that makes a designer give up their entire weekend to help local communities and organisation? <a href=\"http://www.smartemma.co.uk/\">Emma Smart</a>, who worked on the Signposts' video and website, happens to live near Preston where the charity has a local centre. She says:</p> <blockquote> <p>We all know money is short and many of these organisations are struggling, so it's actually really nice to be able to have a chat with them and really put my skills to work for something important. Organisations like Signposts tend to overlook the importance of a good website, a clear leaflet but it can be really helpful for their outreach work.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-429792406\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349948151666/signosts2.jpg\" alt=\"signposts\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working it out: the team allotted to Signposts' projects.

The UK government was putting \u00a33bn into the new green investment bank, and aims to cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 34% by 2020, he said.</p> <p>Asked about Norway's new programme, Davey said: \"I would say that the UK government has very ambitious climate change targets and carbon emission reduction targets.</p> <p>\"We were one of the first countries in the world to pass legally binding targets on ourselves, with the Climate Change Act 2008 which had cross party support. And the government has introduced on the back of that, the fourth carbon budget and the whole electricity market reform, the green deal, the green investment bank.</p> <p>\"These are all our tools to deliver on those targets; these are incredibly ambitious and maybe some countries are catching us up.\"</p> <p>Ranking third among the world's oil exporters, with production peaking at 3m barrels of oil a day, Norway has 51 active oil and gas fields in the North Sea, and believes it has more than 7bn barrels of undiscovered reserves. Its oil and gas sector is the world's richest: <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-16/norway-oil-output-growth-strangled-by-rising-rig-costs-red-tape.html\" title=\"\">its employees earn $180,000 on average a year</a>.</p> <p>With a population of 5 million - the same as Scotland - it is the third wealthiest country per capita in the world thanks to its oil and gas exports. Norway's plans to offset the impacts of its oil exports on the world's climate come as it also proposes to expand oil exploration into the Barents Sea to the far north.</p> <p>Richard Dixon, director of WWF Scotland, said: \"Norway is showing how you can use oil income to fund the transition out of oil, we should be doing the same with UK oil revenues. The Scottish National Party have always been keen on the Norwegian oil fund, and now it is setting an example really worth following.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Art makes people better people,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/renzo-piano\">Renzo Piano</a>, \"and a place for art makes the city a better place to be.\"</p> <p>He is speaking at the opening of the <a href=\"http://afmuseet.no/en/hjem\">Astrup Fearnley Museum</a> on the Oslo waterfront, a new \u00a365m home for the private art collection of a <a href=\"http://www.fearnleys.com/\">shipping company</a>, which he describes as \"an open forum, where art meets life\".</p> <p>Piano should know about such things. The 74-year-old has designed 17 museums and art galleries across the world in his long career, ranging from the revolutionary vertical art factory of the <a href=\"http://www.centrepompidou.fr/en\">Centre Georges Pompidou</a> in Paris, built with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/richard-rogers\">Richard Rogers</a> in 1977, to the refined, low-slung shed of the <a href=\"http://www.menil.org/\">Menil Collection</a> in Houston, Texas, constructed 10 years later, to the delicate lightbox of the <a href=\"http://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en\">Fondation Beyeler</a>, erected outside Basel in 1997. Each decade brought a seminal new building that changed the way architects think about spaces for art, cementing Piano's reputation as a global brand for big museums.</p> <p>\"I see Astrup Fearnley as completing the cycle, almost coming back to the beginning,\" he tells me, as we sit in the upper gallery, looking out across the fjord \u2013 a picture-postcard view dotted with islands and sailing boats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397573459\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349947189153/Renzo-Piano-Astrup-Fearnl-010.jpg\" alt=\"Renzo Piano Astrup Fearnley\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The building takes the form of a curvaceous glass sail on the waterfront</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"The Pompidou was a rebellion against the idea of a monumental gallery. We were the bad boys then,\" he grins. \"We didn't want to make a mausoleum to art. Instead, we created a big piazza for the people, and here in Oslo we have returned to that idea.\"</p> <p>Right on the waterfront, the museum takes the form of a vast glass sail that arcs over to envelop three timber buildings beneath, separated by a canal and terminating the dockside promenade in a consciously iconic swoop. Unlike many of his previous galleries, which take the form of finely tuned if somewhat anonymous containers, Astrup Fearnley is here to play the role of glamorous civic saviour \u2013 the cultural anchor for a whole new urban quarter.</p> <p>The redevelopment of <a href=\"http://tjuvholmen.no/?did=9095438\">Tjuvholmen</a> \u2013 literally \"thief island\" \u2013 is the latest part of Oslo's ongoing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fjord_City\">Fjord City</a> programme, which began with the transformation of the adjacent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aker_Brygge\">Aker Brygge</a> district in the 1980s, turning former shipyards into a mix of high-end apartments, restaurants and offices. Already home to several <a href=\"http://www.visitoslo.com/en/activities-and-attractions/boroughs/aker-brygge-tjuvholmen/attractions/\">independent galleries</a>, it is hoped Tjuvholmen will become something of an \"art island\" in the city.</p> <p>\"People come here to swim, or have a coffee, and sooner or later they will fall in love with art,\" says Piano, his slow, avuncular tones making the gallery-as-regeneration-machine formula sound deceptively simple.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397573460\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349948110235/Renzo-Piano-Astrup-Fearnl-006.jpg\" alt=\"Renzo Piano Astrup Fearnley\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The gallery opens up to a pebble beach on the edge of the fjord</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Scandinavia doesn't have the cultural formalities of southern Europe,\" he adds. \"This is a place where culture and community come together in a very natural and informal way.\"</p> <p>In keeping with this philosophy, the project is conceived as \"a little piece of city\", the cluster of buildings defining streets that open out on to an undulating waterside park, which dips down into a hollowed-out pebble beach at its westernmost end. A broad stone staircase descends between the two buildings farthest north, providing places to sit and watch the world go by. In theory, it has all the ingredients to make it an attractive place to while away a sunny afternoon. But there's something not quite right.</p> <p>The whole complex is strangely corporate, which comes as no surprise when it emerges that the biggest of the three buildings is in fact the six-storey office of a legal firm. Its street frontage is not a street, but a blank expanse of timber and glass, closely surveyed by CCTV cameras.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397573461\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349947304282/Renzo-Piano-Astrup-Fearnl-003.jpg\" alt=\"Renzo Piano Astrup Fearnley\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The temporary exhibition space is covered by a sweeping glass roof</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The architectural language is typical Piano, with elements designed as a kit of parts: the way they are put together is strongly expressed, as if to demonstrate the craft of making \u2013 his practice is not called <a href=\"http://www.rpbw.com/\">\"building workshop\"</a> for nothing. The wooden walls are autonomous, sliding planes, above which the milky glass skin is held aloft on racks of timber ribs, like the skeleton of an upturned whale. It is held together by a nautical array of wires and cables, struts and rigging that betray the architect's love of boats \u2013 but which don't seem to do much to hold up the building. It is a familiar language, but one which recalls the slick spaces of business parks, private leisure centres and luxury yachts more than an inviting new public place.</p> <p>This feeling continues within, where the double-height temporary exhibition gallery feels like the atrium of a global banking headquarters. A double-skin glass ceiling, containing a sandwich of louvers, plunges down over the space, while a mezzanine cuts across at an angle above. These skewed geometries carry on into the adjacent building, creating powerful false perspectives, although many of the rooms feel like leftover corridor space \u2013 as if you're passing artwork on the way to the loo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397573462\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349948007105/Renzo-Piano-Astrup-Fearnl-010.jpg\" alt=\"Renzo Piano Astrup Fearnley\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cross-section of the museum</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a way, this is all strangely appropriate for the Astrup Fearnley collection, which consists of the kind of big, bold lobby art you might find in the foyer of an advertising company \u2013 a mixed bag of Saatchi-like sensationalism amassed over the last 30 years.

  "<p>Can anything save the PC? The industry is giving it all it's got - ultrabooks, faster chips - but so far, nothing's working. Shipment growth for PCs has cratered, falling by the largest percentage year-on-year for 11 years as consumers, corporations and PC manufacturers hit the \"pause\" button ahead of the launch of Microsoft's Windows 8 this month, according to new figures.</p> <p>Now analysts say PC vendors face tough challenges persuading consumers in particular to spend on PCs rather than smartphones and tablets as straitened economic times worsen in many regions. \"We previously had all-singing, all-dancing PCs for some time - they were the only choice for years,\" Ranjit Atwal, Gartner's personal computing analyst, told the Guardian. \"But now the lack of any type of innovation in the PC space has meant that there's very little reason for somebody to go and buy one. That has put the PC at the back of the queue.\"</p> <p>The hope for PC vendors now will be that Windows 8 can rescue the industry from a slow decline, by offering newer form factors to tempt people back. </p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=2194017\">Gartner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23730212\">IDC</a>, which released their figures overnight on Wednesday, say worldwide PC sales fell by over 8% - 8.2% and 8.6% respectively - to below 88m. Proportionally, it is the biggest drop since the same period in 2001, when Windows XP was about to be launched; at that time, PC sales fell by 11.6%. No region showed growth, according to Gartner's figures.</p> <p>In percentage terms, the dip was larger even than that seen in the first quarter of 2009 when the world was struggling with the recession caused by the collapse in late 2008 of Lehman Brothers, and PC sales dropped by 6.8% year-on-year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397572408\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349956861505/pc-market-460.png\" alt=\"Worldwide PC market, Q1 1999-Q3 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Average worldwide PC shipments, Q1 1999 - Q3 2012.

Lenovo showed strong growth, rising by 10% year-on-year - but in effect 18% compared to the rest of the market. HP, Dell and Acer all shrank faster than the rest of the market, according to both research groups, while Asus grew by 11.8% - in effect 20% - to become fifth-largest company. </p> <p>Figures for the US showed that the market there shrank by 13.8%, with four of the top six vendors - HP, Dell, Acer and Toshiba - contracting more quickly. Apple, the third-biggest vendor there, saw sales shrink, though by only 6.1% compared to the larger contraction, and Lenovo, now the fourth-biggest, grew by 6.1% - in effect, a 20% market share growth.</p> <p>PC shipments peaked at just below 96m in the third quarter of 2011, according to the two companies. Since then the figures have drifted down in absolute terms, and shown little or no annual growth.</p> <p>Though it is common for PC sales growth to stall ahead of the launch of a new version of Windows, because consumers and businesses wait to get machines which have the new software already installed, the competition from other computing devices means fresh problems for PC vendors, said Atwal. He said that he had expected there would be a hiatus - \"but didn't think it would be this dramatic. Demand generally is weak. But retailers and distributors are generally hoping that Windows 8 will be the solution.\"</p> <p>At IDC, senior research analyst Jay Chou <a href=\"http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS23730212\">said in a statement</a> that \"PCs are going through a severe slump\u2026 The industry had already weathered a rough second quarter, and now the third quarter was even worse. A weak global economy as well as questions about PC market saturation and delayed replacement cycles are certainly a factor, but the hard question of what is the 'it' product for PCs remain unanswered. While ultrabook prices have come down a little, there are still some significant challenges that will greet Windows 8 in the coming quarter.\"</p> <p>For Gartner, Atwal said that ultrabooks - the sleek, light and faster (but so far pricier) laptops introduced by a number of vendors - represented an important trend for the PC industry. \"The PC industry needs to raise ASPs [average selling prices],\" he said. \"Ultrabooks were meant to be the kickoff for vendors to do that - but ultimately the ASPs of ultrabooks are still too high [to attract many buyers]. Even if they do come down, how do vendors convey value in what they're offering? They need to convey the mobility benefits.\"</p> <p>But he said that there is a core challenge: that the parts of the PC industry are no longer working in synchrony. \"Microsoft and Intel are trying to push new products and software through the ecosystem of [PC] vendors and the 'channe' [of wholesalers and retailers] - which fundamentally hasn't changed. Distributors go for high volume, low margin; retailers go for 'low touch'\" - the latter meaning that minimal human effort is put into a sale.</p> <p>Atwal now expects that the PC market will show little or no overall growth for the year. Gartner's figure say the US had a dramatic 13.8% fall to 15.3m machines, the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region dropping by 8.7% to 25.8m, Asia/Pacific by 5.6% to 31.3m, and Latin America down 6.2% to 9.7m. \"The Windows 8 transition is happening everywhere,\" said Atwal. \"There's softer demand [due to economic conditions] anyway; the Windows 8 transition is exaggerating the weakness in the PC market.\" He reckons that transition - with Windows 8 due to be officially launched at the end of October - \"accounts for a significant proportion of the [slowdown] in terms of an inventory shift.\"</p> <p>Gartner's figures include a substantial uprating of PC shipments for the third quarter of 2011, which a year ago it estimated at 91.8m; now it puts the figure at 95.4m, deepening the slowdown for this period.</p>",
  "<p>Cities present a sustainability conundrum: though they are the most efficient way to provide infrastructure and services for large populations, they are, in absolute terms, incredibly inefficient.</p> <p>Cities cover just 2% of the Earth's surface yet consume about 75% of the world's resources, and given that more of the world's population now live in cities than in rural areas, it's clear they are key to tackling climate change and reducing resource use.</p> <p>Urban administrators face huge challenges to make cities more sustainable. From traffic jams and inefficient buildings to social inequality and housing, the problems are complex and hard to tackle \u2014 but not insurmountable.</p> <p>Some cities are forging ahead with the use of innovative urban planning, technological and governance models, showing that with the right focus and resources, cities can become \"smart\" or more sustainable.</p> <p>According to the latest Siemens' <a href=\"http://www.siemens.com/press/en/events/2011/corporate/2011-02-asia.php\" title=\"\">Green City Index for Asia</a>, Singapore is the best-performing city in the region when measured against a range of sustainability criteria.</p> <p>\"Singapore is at the leading edge of sustainability,\" says Nicholas You, chairman of the World Urban Campaign Steering Committee at <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=9\" title=\"\">UN-Habitat</a>. \"It's an island state with limited resources so it had no choice but to go green if it wanted to survive economically.\"</p> <p>Singapore's experiences have important lessons for other urban centres. Take its water treatment. In 1963, water functionality was shared between multiple ministries and agencies, which made it difficult to formulate a coordinated, long-term strategy.</p> <p>With a rising population and finite freshwater resources, action was needed, so ministers set up a national water agency, PUB, which became the sole body responsible for the collection, production, distribution and reclamation of water in the city.</p> <p>Today, its water operation has been transformed. Two thirds of Singapore's land surface is now a water catchment area with water stored in 17 reservoirs, including the Marina Basin, right in the heart of the city.</p> <p>Called NEWater, wastewater is collected and treated to produce water that's good enough to drink. This meets 30% of the city's water needs, a target that will be increased to 50% of future needs by 2060.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Siemens was contracted to identify CO2 reduction opportunities in transport, residential and non-industrial buildings, and IT/communications in the Tampines district.</p> <p>As part of the city's plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, Siemens will report back in 2013 with implementation costs, a plan to implement the changes and the design of pilots to trail three technological solutions.</p> <p>\"This will be a good test-bed for new technologies to prove what we can do,\" says Dr Roland Busch, Siemens' CEO of infrastructure and cities sector. \"It's a way to demonstrate in the highly competitive environment that is Singapore, that we can bring energy efficiency to the next level in addressing all the basic needs of cities.\"</p> <p>EDF and Veolia recently signed an agreement with Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB), the city-state's largest developer, to develop software that will help it develop sustainable, urban planning solutions in HDB towns.</p> <p>ForCity will simulate the built environment of a city and its impact on resources, the environment, people and intervention costs to help the HDB make its towns function more efficiently and become more pleasant to live in. The tool will be trialed in the Jurong East district of Singapore.</p> <p>Transport is another sector that has seen investment recently. On an island of 4.8 million people with limited space, moving people around as efficiently as possible is key to its economic viability. A decade ago, city administrators warned that congestion could cost Singapore's economy $2-3bn a year if transport infrastructure was not improved.</p> <p>Then, there were two separate transport-charging systems in the city: road tolls and public transport, including the metro and buses. But since 2009, after a series of smart card innovations, people have been able to use e-Symphony, an IBM-designed payment card that can be used to pay for road tolls, bus travel, taxis, the metro, and even shopping.</p> <p>The card can process 20 million fare transactions a day and collects extensive traffic data, allowing city administrators to constantly tweak routes to ensure the most efficient journeys and minimise congestion.</p> <p>All these measures combine to make Singapore a smarter city. \"What we have done is to research and try to distill the principles for Singapore's success in sustainable urban development \u2013 we call it a liveability framework,\" says Khoo Teng Chye, executive director at the Centre for Liveable Cities based in Singapore.</p> <p>\"Quality of life, environmental sustainability and competitive economics. These are the components that make cities liveable.\"</p> <p>As the competition for resources increases and cities expand to accommodate rising populations, even those without the geographic constraints of Singapore will have to embrace smart city principles. If they don't, they will lose out financially, unable to attract businesses and talent from cities that do. The planet simply can't sustain current levels of resource use and environmental degradation. It's not a choice; cities <em>have</em> to change.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>In December 1981 the Observer ran Hugh McIlvanney's elegy for Muhammad Ali after the great fighter's career-ending defeat by Trevor Berbick in the Bahamas under the headline \"The king who went out on a dustcart\". Most recent accounts of the sacking of Sir Alf Ramsey as England's manager on 1 May 1974 adopt the same tone, summoning a mixture of regret and indignation at such shabby maltreatment.</p> <p>When reading the statement put out by the Football Association's international committee, under the imperious influence of Sir Harold Thompson, to announce the 1966 World Cup winner's dismissal, one concedes the validity of their disgust.</p> <p>\"Committees of the FA, which have been considering the future of English football,\" it read in Kremlin-apparatchik charmless prose, \"have examined some aspects in detail and progress has been made. At a meeting on 14 February the executive committee set up a sub committee with the following terms of reference: To consider our future policy in respect of the promotion of international football. Following meetings, a unanimous recommendation was submitted to the executive committee that Sir Alf Ramsey should be replaced as the England team manager. The recommendation was accepted unanimously by the executive committee.\" Colin Crompton could not have put it more mellifluously.</p> <p>And yet this sense of disservice is revisionist. Since April 1972, when G\u00fcnter Netzer had orchestrated West Germany's 3-1 evisceration of England at Wembley in the first leg of the European Championship quarter-final, it had become quite common to read that Ramsey had outlived his usefulness. The away leg, a 0-0 draw for which the manager had picked Arsenal's Peter Storey and Leeds United's Norman Hunter in midfield, was littered with so many England fouls that the correspondent of the biggest selling newspaper of the day, Alan Hoby of the Sunday Express, wrote: \"I felt embarrassed and ashamed by the Englishmen's violent, ugly methods.\"</p> <p>After the draw with Poland in 1973, Ramsey lingered for six months while England's absence for the first time from a World Cup finals tournament that they had deigned to enter sank in. The Poland game provoked a withering editorial from Foul magazine. \"Dirty defensive play was actually programmed into the English tactical plan before the match began \u2026 so when we say that Alf must go, it's not purely because we want to see England's football lifted out of the sterile unimaginative rut \u2026 it's not because English supporters would like to see wing-halves and flank forwards given a chance to establish themselves before they become extinct \u2026 it is because the whole idea of using illegal tactics as a defensive ploy to cover for the inadequacies at the back, and to incapacitate the opposition from keeping our forwards out, is sickening and a travesty of the way football should be played.\"</p> <p>The motive, then, was perceived as just even if the FA's method was typically ignominious. Ramsey's employers kept him hanging on for two more matches after the conclusion of the World Cup qualifying group, a 1-0 defeat at home by Italy to close 1973 in which Bobby Moore won his last cap and a 0-0 draw with Portugal in Lisbon the following spring when the manager, perhaps keen to indicate conspicuously that he was demonstrably not yesterday's man, sloughed off his hidebound reputation and gave debuts to Phil Parkes, Mike Pejic, Martin Dobson, Dave Watson, Stan Bowles and Trevor Brooking. His attempt at rejuvenation, however, was in vain. The FA had come to its decision even before England took the field at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz.</p> <p>Thompson had, according to Brian Glanville and Leo McKinstry, borne a grudge ever since Ramsey had asked the FA chairman to extinguish the cigar he was smoking at the breakfast table in the team hotel after the players had complained about the fumes. \"Sir Alf's fate was sealed from that moment,\" wrote McKinstry. Thompson, the vice-president of St John's College, Oxford, had been enraged by Ramsey's lack of deference.</p> <p>There is something hilariously hypocritical about Thompson's concept of respect and his behaviour towards England's managers. Ramsey \u2013 who was knighted in 1967, a year before Thompson \u2013 was insulted by the committeeman's insistence on always referring to him by surname alone. At an official dinner in 1976 when Don and Elsie Revie were sitting next to Thompson, Ramsey's eventual long-term successor objected to his employer's supercilious schoolmasterly form of address. \"When I get to know you better, Revie, I shall call you Don,\" Thompson pompously said. In a brilliant but reckless reply, Revie said: \"When I get to know you better, Thompson, I will call you Sir Harold.\"</p> <p>Analysing Ramsey's sacking and the part prickly relations between the two knights played in it, Glanville wrote: \"Thompson was surely right, but probably right for the wrong reasons.\" The FA settled Ramsey's \u00a37,200-a-year contract, paying the 54-year-old a lump sum of \u00a38,000 and granted him an annual pension of \u00a31,200. By comparison, when Revie was appointed he told the FA the salary might just pass muster in Division Three but First Division managers were on considerably higher wages. After negotiation, Revie and the FA settled on \u00a325,000 a year, slightly higher than the top-flight average but much less than the \u00a350,000 signing-on fee plus \u00a331,500-a-year deal Everton had offered Revie in the summer of 1973. That 240% increase on the England manager's salary was symptomatic of a governing body that had exploited Ramsey's sense of duty and it was how the FA treated him as a man rather than as a manager that drew most censure.</p> <p>For years at formal briefings Ramsey had treated criticism with contempt and adopted a brooding aloofness that conveyed his impatience and scorn. Informally he could, said David Lacey, \"be an engaging conversationalist if caught in the right mood and at the right moment\". The public, though, who were dependent on the filter of the media and the bear-baiting derision of ITV pundits such as Malcolm Allison and Brian Clough, could be forgiven for wanting a respite from Ramsey's defensiveness and taciturnity. The leading candidates to replace him \u2013 Leicester's Jimmy Bloomfield, Coventry's Gordon Milne, Gordon Jago of QPR, Burnley's Jimmy Adamson and Bolton's Jimmy Armfield \u2013 all offered the opportunity of a generational shift and most of them an affability alien to Ramsey. It was too late, though, to conclude negotiations with any of them or their clubs before the Home Championship and the summer tour, so the FA resolved to appoint a caretaker and chose the epitome of cordiality and benevolence, luring Joe Mercer out of semi-retirement as the general manager of Coventry City to hold the fort.</p> <p>The contrast with Ramsey was marked at his first press conference. \"His humour has fluttered happily about the stage recently vacated by the serious monologist,\" wrote the Observer's Peter Corrigan. \"Kind words and patted backs have added gaiety to the atmosphere and we are near the realisation of the worst fears of those who equate his temporary appointment as England team manager to Uncle Remus doing holiday relief for Genghis Khan.\"</p> <p>At the age of 59 when he agreed to take the post, Mercer had spent the past 43 years in football, first as an attacking wing-half with the Everton side who won the title in 1938-39 before losing the cream of his career to military service during the second world war, then winning two more league championships as Arsenal's captain in 1947-48 and 1952-53. After a year spent running his grocery business on retirement, he was appointed manager of Sheffield United, moving to Aston Villa following three and a half seasons at Bramall Lane.</p> <p>At Villa Park he built a competitive and talented young side who were dubbed, given the fad for alliterative nicknames such as Drake's Ducklings and the Busby Babes, the Mercer Minors. He won the first League Cup with Villa in 1961 but was sacked in July 1964 after returning from a sabbatical he had been forced to take to recover from a nervous breakdown. Although he was advised by his doctor to forgo completely the stresses of management he applied for and was appointed Manchester City's manager in 1965 where, in tandem with Allison, the visionary coach he hired as soon as he got the job, he almost went through the card in trophies \u2013 Second Division title, Football League championship, FA, League and Cup Winners' Cups.</p> <p>His contribution to City was commemorated in the Kippax tribute still sung at the Etihad to the tune of Auld Lang Syne: \"The Stretford End cried out aloud: 'It's the end of you Sky Blues.' Joe Mercer came. We played the game. We went to Rotherham, we won 1\u20130 and we were back into Division One. We've won the League, we've won the Cup, we've been to Europe too. And when we win the League again we'll sing this song to you: City, City, City.\" Note the lack of any mention for Allison there. By 1970 the coach was exasperated at the perception that his influence was inferior to Mercer's and agitated to succeed his boss. After a couple of years of politicking, with the two men aligned to battling boardroom factions, Allison got his way and Mercer was stripped of responsibility for the first team in October 1971. \"I still believe I have a lot to offer,\" he said. \"I'm a tactician not an administrator and don't really see myself as a general manager.\" But a general manager he became, seeing out the season in which City's title bid stalled after the signing of Rodney Marsh, before leaving for Coventry to mentor Milne.</p> <p>Anyone who thought that, at his age and with his mobility restricted by chronic sciatica, Mercer would be happy to take his role literally by doubling up as the team's protector and maintenance man was quickly disabused. \"I have given a lot of thought to my task,\" he said, \"and psychologically I have to make sure that the loyalty these players gave to Alf lives on for the next manager. Anything I add to the excellent organisation Alf left behind must be a natural extension of it. Tactics, after all, are there as a base from which players can express themselves naturally.\"</p> <p>The squad at his disposal had been picked by Ramsey 12 days before his sacking was announced. Mercer's demand that the 20-strong selection expressed themselves naturally and his instruction at their first gathering were the fundamentals of the philosophy he adopted for his 36 days in charge. \"Let's all at least bloody smile, eh lads?\" he said to them.</p> <p>For his first match against Wales at Ninian Park, Mercer opted for a three-man forward line of Mick Channon, Stan Bowles and Kevin Keegan, the latter winning only his third cap in three years, oddly all against Wales. Leaving out Martin Peters and thus breaking the chain with 1966, Mercer had said that he would select players of quality and verve and was true to his word. Wales, who hadn't scored a goal for 364 days, were easily outplayed but, paradoxically for David Lacey given Mercer's emphasis on attack, the defence, and Colin Todd in particular, deserved most credit. Although Bowles opened the scoring in the first half, it gave a misleading gloss to an otherwise disjointed contribution from the QPR attacker. More significantly was the identity of the second scorer, Keegan with his first for England after sticking out a foot to meet David Nish's cross. \"Having sacked the producer and thrown away the script,\" wrote Lacey in the Guardian, \"England could hardly have hoped for more than a series of impromptu sketches and if this was the sum of their ambitions they were not to be disappointed.\"</p> <p>Expected to experiment four days later against Northern Ireland at Wembley, Mercer picked the same team, again awarding Emlyn Hughes the captaincy, sticking with three of Derby County's back four and issuing Keegan with another licence to roam. But it was the player best known to Mercer, Manchester City's tireless midfield dynamo Colin Bell, who had the greatest impact by establishing dominance in midfield thanks to his tenacity for winning possession and his powerful, surging breaks upfield. Keegan, too, managed to reproduce some of his trademark club darts behind the full-backs but was too often let down by the service of a team that sent in too many crosses for one without an orthodox centre-forward, centres that Pat Jennings easily thwarted. Mercer resolved this after 55 minutes, \"at a stroke\", he said, by replacing Bowles with Leicester City's Frank Worthington who was deadly in the air, a quality his misleading reputation as a flick-obsessed showman has obscured. Fourteen minutes into his debut Worthington rose beyond the far post to direct a header from Channon's cross towards his club-mate Keith Weller who nodded the ball past Jennings in a goal conceived at Filbert Street.</p> <p>Two games for Mercer and two victories with enough grounds for optimism to keep his smiling face in the papers appended to his anointment as \"Uncle Joe\". But the real test was still to come, England's five-match run as jilted warm-up man for teams who had qualified for the World Cup in West Germany. Scotland came first but before the caretaker faced his first traditional Hampden Park reception, he had to deal with Bowles, who had absconded from the team's Welwyn hotel two nights before the game to go to the dogs at White City. Asked by a reporter who spotted him whether he intended to return to fly to Scotland the next day, he said: \"No.\" He later rang Mercer to apologise and issued a statement saying: \"I left the England party yesterday because I was sick and depressed. It has always been my ambition to play for England, particularly at Wembley, and no one can know how I felt when I was taken off.\" Mercer accepted the apology, saying: \"It's sad isn't it?\" then told Bowles there was no way back under his management.</p> <p>Worthington started against Scotland in Bowles's place, with Peters in for Keegan and Norman Hunter for the injured Roy McFarland, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhlMg6-jAFU\" title=\"\">but England failed comprehensively on a sodden pitch</a> to match Scotland's flexibility, the pace of the rampaging full-backs Danny McGrain and Sandy Jardine and the central midfield control seized by Billy Bremner and Davie Hay. They were 2-0 down after 30 minutes and, though Dave Watson's introduction at half-time to replace Hunter and end the experiment with two No6s at the heart of defence, stemmed the Scottish tide, the nearest England came to goals were rare headers from Peters and Worthington. Lacey, citing Harold Pinter's The Caretaker, highlighted the team's lack of fluency: \"England did not play badly in their makeshift mundane way; but in the hands of their caretaker they have become a team of Davises, each with an idea of how to get to Sidcup, none with the means, on his own, of putting the operation into practice.\"</p> <p>Argentina's visit to Wembley on the Wednesday night following the defeat at Hampden Park was their first since the ill-tempered World Cup quarter-final in 1966 that is for ever linked with Antonio Ratt\u00edn's sending-off and Ramsey's excoriation of England's opponents as \"animals\". So raw were Argentina's wounds that they agreed to stop off en route to West Germany only if an Argentinian refereed the game. This precondition proved crucial.</p> <p>With Nish injured, Hughes moved to right-back where he was partnered, on the opposite flank, by his Anfield team-mate Alec Lindsay. Keegan, Channon and Worthington were given the opportunity to impress up front, with the graceful Brooking, after a long campaign by Glanville, at last given the role of midfield creator to dovetail with Keegan's clever exploitation of space. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRXX-bjMJIk\" title=\"\">England went ahead seconds before half-time</a>, Bell rolling a pass behind Argentina's defence for Channon to race on to, round the keeper and score. As the players trooped off for half-time, Hughes pushed his counterpart, the captain Roberto Perfumo, in the midst of an argument, only for his other counterpart, the right-back Rub\u00e9n Glaria, to end the row by smacking Hughes in the face. Remarkably the referee, Arturo Iturralde, chose to ignore this and Argentina defused the situation by replacing Glaria for the second half.</p> <p>England's slick passing and movement made another inroad 10 minutes after the break from a corner won when Worthington latched on to Brooking's excellent penetrative pass. Keegan took it short and when the ball was clipped into the penalty area it bounced up in front of Bell who smashed a shot against the underside of the crossbar and left Worthington to turn the ball in with an acrobatic flick of his left foot. Mario Kempes got one back four minutes later, steering home his shot from 15-yards after Peter Shilton had palmed out a cross to his feet. But with only a minute of the match remaining and England looking more confident and commanding than they had done for more than a year against such good opposition, Kempes struck again. Having taken too much time to control Ren\u00e9 Houseman's cross, Kempes was tackled by Hughes, seemingly fairly. But such was the flourish with which the centre-forward threw himself to the turf, the referee, Kempes's countryman, was persuaded to award a penalty despite the England captain's impassioned protestations. The crowd clearly thought Kempes had dived, booing him as he ran up to take the penalty, continuing after he smacked it past Shilton and building to a climax moments later at the conclusion of the match. Yet despite conceding an undeserved draw, England's spirit, coherence and occasional flamboyance suggested the players were beginning to break the bonds of caution and rigidity.</p> <p>Mercer flew with the squad to Leipzig for the first leg of their tour, where they took on East Germany, who would defeat their neighbours, hosts and eventual winners, West Germany, in the group stage of the World Cup. After playing in all four of Mercer's games, Keith Weller's international career ended with him being dropped for Martin Dobson who won his second cap, this time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu9VvKoRyhE\" title=\"\">in front of a crowd of 100,000 at Zentralstadion</a>.</p> <p>With Worthington, Keegan and Channon again selected up front, as they would be for all three games in eastern Europe, England picked up where they had left off against Argentina, tearing the East Germany defence apart and beating a tattoo on the woodwork, hitting the bar and a post twice each. The movement of the front three caused havoc, creating opportunities for Dobson, Brooking and Bell to shoot as well as repeatedly carving out chances for themselves. And yet they fell behind in the second half to Joachim Streich's goal 24 minutes from time. It took 90 seconds for England to rally, Channon equalising direct from a free-kick with a scorching shot, and though a draw was disappointing given their excellence and ebullience, Mercer was heartened by the performance. \"We hit the woodwork more times than a team of lumberjacks,\" he said ruefully. \"An old-fashioned manager and old-fashioned posts.\"</p> <p>In the Observer Corrigan noted that the caretaker had been treated to a bottle of champagne after the match to celebrate England's exhilarating display. \"The cork popped with such force it hit the ceiling and rebounded into the company. 'Christ, we've hit the post again,' Mercer said.\" With a spirit of adventure restored to the side, one shy FA official told Lacey: \"I haven't enjoyed a game so much for years.\"</p> <p>Keeping the same lineup for the match in Sofia against Bulgaria, England came away with a 1-0 victory that flattered their hosts. Again the interchanging of Keegan, Worthington and Channon flummoxed the opposition and, with Bell, Dobson and Brooking sharing an ability to find the front men, England destroyed the Bulgarian defenders' positional discipline. Worthington scored by beating the offside trap before calmly finishing when one-on-one with the keeper but it was Channon's marauding running and deft manipulation of the ball that enchanted the crowd.</p> <p>Apart from a problem over accommodation in Sofia, eventually sorted out when the squad was given the press's hotel and the journalists each given three bottles of beer to compensate for their relegation for a night into inferior digs, there had been no hitches on the tour. All that changed the morning after they had defeated Bulgaria when they arrived at Belgrade airport. Keegan, like the rest of the squad, was not wearing his England tie or blazer, a sartorial lapse with unpleasant consequences. While waiting for his luggage he sat down near the baggage carousel while a couple of his team-mates messed about on the conveyor belt. Keegan was promptly arrested by Yugoslavia's border police and taken to a back room, where he was punched, kicked and truncheoned before being charged with sexually assaulting a stewardess, a further assault on a guard, disturbing the peace and causing an obstruction. The players refused to abandon him to his fate and FA officials, British embassy staff and Mercer eventually persuaded Keegan's captors that he was innocent and should be released.</p> <p>Keegan, battered, bleeding and shaken, was not, however, spooked by his experience when he took the field. Keeping an unchanged side for the third game in succession England once again impressed, this time as much for their fortitude as their new-found attacking adroitness. Channon put them 1-0 up from a corner before Yugoslavia had hit their stride, spurring the hosts to up the ante with some sublime, inventive passing and intelligent runs. They equalised before half-time and took the lead when Brane Oblak hit a thunderous 25-yard shot past Ray Clemence in the second half.</p> <p>England, less assured than they had been during the preceding three games, attempted to gain a foothold back in the match by using Channon's pace to try to stretch the opposition defence but they were too canny and too often ushered him down culs de sac. Throwing on a substitute for the first time since Hampden, Mercer sent on Malcolm MacDonald for Worthington and after 10 minutes the replacement found Keegan, who scored England's second with a thumping diving header. At the death MacDonald bullocked through the offside trap only to spurn the chance to win the match by snatching at his shot and England ended the tour with a creditable draw.</p> <p>And that was the end of Mercer's mission. The FA was so impressed by the friendly atmosphere he had fostered that questions about the possibility of Mercer taking the job on a longer-term basis, with his Coventry protege Gordon Milne as the straight man in the double act, were not immediately quashed. Mercer, too, seemed open to persuasion but the FA was working on another plan, putting out feelers to the most successful English club manager available, Leeds United's Revie, which ultimately proved fruitful even if Lancaster Gate subsequently had grave cause to regret its choice.</p> <p>Mercer went back to Highfield Road, thanked for putting the smile back on the face of English football during what Glanville vividly called his \"beguiling interregnum\" . Moreover he had established a platform for more free-wheeling talents in the side, a sadly short-lived achievement as far as Worthington was concerned but one which benefited Keegan and Channon. Just as importantly, though it proved ephemeral, was giving England their dignity back on the eve of a World Cup at which they would be bystanders. It had been all very well for England to refuse invitations to the World Cup before the second world war but one must emphasise how deep the sense of humiliation felt was by the realisation that they were too damn ugly to attend the global television party.</p> <p>\"I didn't want this bloody job in the first place,\" Mercer had told the players, naturally with a smile, at their first meeting. By succeeding at restoring their reputation, however briefly, the reluctant caretaker did more than keep the house in order. He gave them a blueprint for renovation that was disastrously ignored when the caution and anxiety he had temporarily banished returned with a vengeance.</p>",

Existential Photography, London</strong><br></br>Cameras and guns go way back it seems. Punters for the fairground photo shooting galleries that emerged after world war one took aim at targets that triggered a camera and created a portrait. Artists and thinkers from Man Ray to Simone De Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, were apparently hooked on the phenomenon. Here, a collection of these vintage sideshow snaps provides the lift-off point for artists riffing on the theme. Plenty of these hinge on sexy climaxes where phallic guns and cameras conflate voyeurism, sexual aggression and death, like Christian Marclay\u2019s riveting mash-ups of Hollywood movie clips. His film projections surround the audience with erotically-charged shots of guns firing straight at us. <br></br><strong><em><a href=\"http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/\">The Photographer\u2019s Gallery</a>, W1, Fri 12 Oct to 6 Jan</em></strong><br></br><em>SS</em><br></br>Simone de Beauvoir & Jean-Paul Sartre (1929)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jazz Editions</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

If employment protection really is such a millstone round employers' necks, then freeing yourself from at least some of it would be well worth \u00a32k per employee.<br>If, on the other hand, employment protection is only a minor factor affecting Britain's economic performance, as most of the data seem to suggest, then the take-up of this scheme would be negligible.<br>Which is probably why the plan will never see the light of day. It is a very complex, laborious, lawyer-and-consultant-intensive way to deal with a relatively minor problem. It would take up a lot of government and management time for little or no benefit.

  "<p>More than a hundred carbon capture and storage projects (CCS) must be built to avoid dangerous global warming, an international CCS group said this week, as fears were raised over whether UK projects would benefit from an EU fund for 12 demonstration plants.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/get-involved/in-focus/2012/10/global-status-ccs-2012\" title=\"\">Global CCS Institute said in a report published on Wednesday</a> that governments needed to offer policies that show stronger commitment to CCS. It revealed that only one new large-scale CCS plant was built in the past year, taking the total number to 75, while eight projects were cancelled.</p> <p>The chief executive, Brad Page, said CCS could play a key role in keeping temperature rises under 2C, the level deemed \"safe\" by climate scientists, but only with a huge expansion in projects. \"The number of operational projects would need to increase to about 130 by 2020, but this seems unlikely, with institute projections indicating that only 51 of the remaining 59 projects identified in our annual survey may be operational by then.\"</p> <p>The report came as <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/74c6944c-0e4c-11e2-b87e-00144feabdc0.html\">it emerged</a> that the UK had been given until the end of the month by the European commission to confirm funding for a multibillion EU funding programme, <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/lowcarbon/ner300/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">NER300</a>, for 12 new CCS projects. Under the scheme, host countries must co-fund projects for them to be eligible for the pot.

And as we prove the commercial viability of CCS, we have the chance to create in that process an exciting export opportunity for companies that become early leaders in this technology.\" On Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_122/pn12_122.aspx\" title=\"\">he announced \u00a320m of funding for R&amp;D into CCS for gas power stations</a>.</p> <p>Chris Littlecott, senior policy adviser at environmental organisation E3G, said: \"CCS can play a significant role in helping to meet UK carbon budgets while stimulating investment in infrastructure and retaining jobs in high-value-added industries. The key sticking point however remains the Treasury. George Osborne has the opportunity to secure CCS as a growth sector the UK \u2013 indeed his love of gas must be matched by support for CCS.\"</p>",
  "<p>The term \"hydrogen economy\" refers to the vision of using hydrogen as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/26/low-carbon-energy\">low-carbon energy source</a> \u2013 replacing, for example, gasoline as a transport fuel or natural gas as a heating fuel. Hydrogen is attractive because whether it is burned to produce heat or reacted with air in a fuel cell to produce electricity, the only byproduct is water.</p> <p>Hydrogen is not found in pure form on Earth, however, so it must be produced from other compounds such as natural gas, biomass, alcohols or water. In all cases it takes energy to convert these into pure hydrogen. For that reason, hydrogen is really an energy carrier or storage medium rather than an energy source in itself \u2013 and the climate change impact of using it depends on the carbon footprint of the energy used to produce it.</p> <p>One of the most potentially useful ways to use hydrogen is in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars\">electric cars or buses</a> in conjunction with a fuel cell which converts the hydrogen into electricity. Fuel cells are attractive because they're far more efficient than the internal combustion engines they can replace \u2013 though the latter can still be used with hydrogen fuels if desired.</p> <p>At the moment, hydrogen is most commonly produced from natural gas. In this situation, a typical fuel cell car generates <a href=\"http://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/4301/1/Offer-etal-Comparative-Analysis-BEV-HFC-EnergyPolicy2009.pdf\">70\u201380g</a> CO2 for each kilometre driven \u2013 similar to a modern gasoline hybrid or to a battery electric vehicle charged with today's UK grid electricity. These emissions can be reduced towards zero if the hydrogen is produced using low-carbon electricity sources such as renewables, nuclear or CCS to electrolyse water. The downside is that in this situation&#xa0;only around half as much electricity comes out of the fuel cell as was put in to produce the hydrogen in the first place. The rest is lost as heat.</p> <p>Partly for this reason, and partly due to concerns over the commercial readiness of hydrogen fuel cell cars, battery-based electric cars have received more attention in recent years than hydrogen cars. However, hydrogen vehicles retain a number of important advantages: they can be rapidly refuelled in just a couple of minutes and have a range of many hundreds of kilometres. So the best technology depends on the final cost, carbon mitigation potential, and consumer needs in each case.</p> <p>In addition to transport, hydrogen may also be useful as a way to store renewable energy from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/29/intermittant-solar-wind-energy\">intermittent sources</a> \u2013 for example, when the wind is blowing but there is not high demand for electricity. In this context, it's an alternative to large-scale batteries or other storage systems. Another possibility is to use hydrogen as a heating fuel in our homes and buildings, either blended with natural gas or neat.</p> <p>It is the flexibility that hydrogen offers that makes it so potentially useful within future low-carbon energy systems. It can be produced from a wide variety of resources and can be used in a wide range of applications, such as power generation, as a transport fuel for low carbon vehicles, for the chemical industry, and for low carbon heating. Moreover, hydrogen is already used extensively in the chemical industry so industry is familiar with its production, handling and distribution on a large scale. For all these reasons, many experts see hydrogen as a key enabler of the lowest-cost low-carbon energy system.</p> <p>While hydrogen can help to decarbonise our energy system, however, it is important to be specific about where and when hydrogen can help. In that sense, it might be better to think about 'hydrogen in the economy' rather than 'a hydrogen economy' as such.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was written by Prof Nigel Brandon of the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/energyfutureslab/\">Energy Futures Lab</a> and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/climatechange\">Grantham Institute for Climate Change</a>, <a href=\"http://imperial.ac.uk/\">Imperial College London</a>, in collaboration with the Guardian</em></p> <h2>The ultimate climate change FAQ</h2> <p>\u2022 This answer last updated: 27.09.2012<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/05/ultimate-climate-change-faq\">Read about the project and suggest a question</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/09/climate-faq-report-error\">Report an error in this answer</a></p> <p><strong>Related questions</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/29/intermittant-solar-wind-energy\">Are solar, wind and marine power too intermittent to be useful?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/08/energy-efficiency-carbon-savings\">What's energy efficiency and how much can it help cut emissions?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/21/economists-climate-change-market-failure\">Why do economists describe climate change as a 'market failure'?</a></p> <h2>This editorial is free to reproduce under Creative Commons</h2> <p><br>This post by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">The Guardian</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/uk/\">Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License</a>.<br>Based on a work at <a xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" rel=\"dc:source\">theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Morrisons</strong> is leading the FTSE 100 fallers - on a day when the market is actually gaining ground - as analysts expressed concerns about the supermarket group after the latest market share figures.</p> <p>Credit Suisse has moved from outperform to neutral, cut its earnings estimates by up to 3% and its price target from 320p to 290p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> After weak first half sales, we thought Morrison needed to get back on form. It hasn't yet. This week's [Kantar Worldpanel] share data suggest further divergence from the market average with August/September worse than the first half. Although management expects negative like for like again for the second half (the first was down 0.9%), we were initially more hopeful. But, following the new data, we have now revised down our expectation of second half like for like to -3.0% from 0.0%. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Espirito Santo, although it still has a buy rating, said:</p> <blockquote> The prolonged underperformance of Morrison is starting to really hurt the company and though there are some explanations (no online offer yet, very few convenience stores so far, lower new store contribution) the fear is that Sir Ken Morrison is right in his conclusion that the new fresh food reformat is just a step too far for Morrison's core customer. Dalton Philips is going to have to turn things around soon. </blockquote> <p>Morrisons' shares are currently down 4p at 270p. But <strong>Burberry</strong> has bounced 95p to \u00a310.98 after its first half trading update proved better than feared (given its profit warning last month). Kate Calvert at Seymour Pierce said:</p> <blockquote> The shares have fallen 27% since its September 11th update and is trading on an undemanding 2013 PE of 14.3 times. While there is still uncertainty over the cost of bringing in-house the fragrance license and over the impact the global economic slowdown will have on luxury spending, we are reassured that demand has not fallen off a cliff and so believe the shares have been oversold. We still consider Burberry a strong long term growth story with significant geographical and product mix opportunities. Consequently, we are upgrading our recommendation to buy [from hold]. </blockquote> <p>Overall, after three days of falls, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has recovered 22.90 points to 5799.61.</p>",
  "<p>Employers frequently seek candidates with bulging contact books, hoping that extensive networks and powerful connections will significantly increase their own business opportunities.</p> <p>Since many students are already engulfed, juggling work and studies, occasions for extending one's groups and associations can be hampered due to sheer logistics and significant lack of time. Therefore, when the Guardian Media Network presented an opportunity to attend a VIP evening with <a href=\"http://www.rga.com/\" title=\"\">R/GA</a> chairman and CEO, <a href=\"http://www.rga.com/about/leadership/bob-greenberg\" title=\"\">Bob Greenberg</a> at their central offices in King's Cross, it became apparent that media students such as myself could kill two birds with one stone.</p> <p>Curiosity was mildly piqued by the undertaking \"to explore the opportunities facing the industry as it adjusts to the chaos of the digital age\", but there was also the chance to rub shoulders with other like-minded individuals in the media and tech industries at the concluding social gathering.</p> <p>Before facing off against the Guardian's Kate Bulkley (a far livelier affair than the dull Obama/Romney debate) Greenberg, a decorated advertising pioneer, gave his own unique perspective on how a new approach to the agency model can help clients change their entire creative structure.</p> <p>Greenberg and his brother Richard founded R/GA in 1977. He states that design has been the single most important aspect throughout his distinguished career. Since the agency's body of work spans 4,000 television commercials (they helped build brands such as Nike) not to mention 400 feature films (including notable industry innovators such as Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange), Greenberg sees mobile and social media as the newest disruptive element, much as the internet had a disruptive effect on the movie industry, and television as the significant disrupter before that.</p> <p>One of the more salient points made that night, which may be relevant to media students, was Greenberg's proposition to create more of a university setting within the creative industry, allowing for on-the-job learning leading to meaningful employment.</p> <p>When faced with the question as to whether or not the education system is failing tech startups, Bob, who is on the board of several American institutions, postulates that changing the curriculum at state universities takes far too long for new pathways to be implemented. This in itself is a severe obstacle to overcome, due to the ever-shifting evolutionary nature of the technology industry.</p> <p>Another valid point was that it will become a more complex environment for many new businesses (let alone technology-based industries), before it leads back to simplicity.</p> <p>Greenberg admits that change is difficult. He believes that companies will continue to pursue that elusive \"something different\" in which to invest, while still having to evolve with the times. Greenberg's stance is that agencies need to \"walk the talk\" and he firmly believes that storytelling is key to the future of all media environments.</p> <p>Joseph L Badaracco, professor of business ethics at Harvard Business School, wrote: \"In today's environment, hoarding knowledge ultimately erodes your power. If you know something very important, the way to get power is by actually sharing it.\" Therefore, the numerous advantages in attending the Media Network's events such as this one cannot be overstated, due in part, to the Guardian's vision to form a community of game-changers in media and technology.</p> <p>Since 1999, their editorial coverage and strategic innovation in the fields of media and technology has been assisting professionals by giving them a creative and commercial edge in these rapidly changing sectors.</p> <p>The Media Network is free to join and among the benefits are weekly newsletters, event invitations, plus all the latest information from the network.

EJF travelled to Guinea in March 2012 where they identified Kummyeong 2 anchored at sea, one mile from the port of Conakry. The vessel had erased its name and painted a new name, Conosu, on its hull.

Admittedly it was years after I'd left school and, in hindsight, a poor fashion decision. But it shows that Yorkshire yobs had no time for the unusual, so the Human League singer's decision to parade around town with his distinctive haircut \u2013 short one side, long and hippy the other \u2013 always seemed to me to be brave in the extreme.</p> <p>The band were not too shabby either, moving from beep-beep experimentalists to fully fledged pop band within a couple of years, complete with fractured egos and the traditional musical differences along the way. </p> <p>The traditional history of the Human League has them discovering a couple of dancers in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Daisy_Nightclub\">Crazy Daisy nightclub</a>, recruiting them as singers and soaring to fame and fortune in the 1980s as a consequence, with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPudE8nDog0\">Don't You Want Me</a> the No 1 hit to seal the deal.</p> <p>But before all that, the League tested the pop waters in 1979 with a pseudonymous release under the Men soubriquet. I Don't Depend on You has all the attributes that led to the League's success \u2013 a catchy synth tune, singalong lyrics and a proper chorus. No <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0z6adZaRXo\">\"listen to the voice of Buddha / saying stop your sericulture\"</a> here.</p> <p>The template may not have been successful in its own right but it showed the band the way forward. And after that the League's star shone brightly if briefly \u2013 perhaps the way all pop stars should shine.</p> <p>Of course that was not the end of the story, with a reunion, new album and new tours. But I like to think the single by the Men, unheralded at the time, marked the moment the Human League moved from cult status to potential stardom.</p>",
  "<p>By raising the question 'might growth be ending?' the Financial Times' chief economic commentator Martin Wolf has got the chattering classes chattering about whether improvements in the lifestyles of most of the population in the so-called advanced economies has come to an end. Drawing on the work of Professor Robert Gordon of Northwestern University, Wolf argues that \"unlimited growth is a heroic assumption\".</p> <p>According to this perspective, for most of human history, apart from growth generated by rising populations, no real increase in output per person was evident. This is certainly true at least for historical (and contemporary) diverse hunter-gatherer societies, whose members foraged every day for food, and then spend the rest of their day sleeping, cooking, chattering and sometimes bickering.</p> <p>It is even roughly true for agrarian societies, where a stored surplus was required in order to provide food for the steady growth in the numbers of people (which explains why the poor perished if production was hit).</p> <p>Then in the mid-18th-century the industrial revolution started in the UK and then spread to other parts of the world. Growth was assured for many years, including 25 years after the second world war, and also between 1996 and 2004. But Wolf, endorses Professor Gordon's analysis that old-style growth is driven by genuinely disruptive, wealth-generating technologies like domestic running water and sewerage, railways, electricity, the internal combustion engine, and the discovery of oil and gas, and argues that productivity has now peaked, and will go into slow decline over the next century or so. . Although the information revolution provides \"enthralling entertainment and communication devices\" it is seemingly incapable of providing genuine wealth generation.</p> <p>It's a neat theory. It's even a plausible theory. However, I wonder whether it stands up to scrutiny.</p> <p>There has certainly been a recession since 2008 in many but not all of the economies of Europe and North America, (although not in other parts of the world like Latin America, Africa and Asia). In London, for example, which has escaped much of the economic downturn in other parts of the UK, private investment in some types of office and other commercial spaces has often been drastically cut back. But instead of allowing resources to lie idle, clever people, with the backing of nimble local authorities, have sometimes seized the opportunity to use land creatively.</p> <p>Two examples from my ongoing ethnographic research in Shoreditch make the point that growth is still possible, even in economically cyclical hard times. Towards the end of last year, for example, the world's first pop-up shopping mall Boxpark, using recycled shipping containers, made its appearance after plans for housing, retail and cultural development had been shelved. Although some commentators (including myself, for example) criticised the appearance of outlets selling global brands like Calvin Klein, Levi's and Puma in an area of east London known more for small independent fashion stores, it is doing very well and drawing huge crowds, especially at weekends.</p> <p>In the same year, a former car park, intended for a multi-storey hotel was transformed into the hugely successful Red Market, a pop-up, night-time food market, where people of diverse ethnicities and nationalities sit, eat interesting food, drink coffee, chat, play p\u00e9tanque, and be entertained by live music. It opened again this year and has been in great demand throughout the summer (although like many consumer-oriented businesses in the capital, it experienced a dip in demand during the Olympics). It has just closed but will re-open in the spring.</p> <p>What has to be acknowledged is that these innovative consumption spaces are highly productive \u2013 they create jobs and wealth on land where otherwise weeds would grow.</p> <p>The idea that the era of economic growth is over in the advanced economies put forward by Professor Gordon and echoed by Martin Wolf is exaggerated \u2013 and this is true even if no more truly disruptive technologies were ever to be discovered. Why? Well, there seems to be an almost infinite number of ways in which late capitalism's well-educated army of entrepreneurs can generate and manipulate symbols, raw materials (including bodies), space and time to create value \u2013 the growth in the restaurant industry, from low-end to high-end, in the UK in recent years is a prime example.</p> <p>Economic growth will be with us for the foreseeable future, although its characteristics and the way it should be measured have changed. The lesson? The structure of the advanced economies is changing in ways that we can barely imagine. Local authorities, and not just those in London, need to be alert to innovative economic opportunities, especially where more conventional plans for growth hit by a cyclical downturn have fallen through.</p> <p><em>Dr Sean Carey is a social anthropologist and research fellow in the school of social sciences at the </em><a href=\"http://www.roehampton.ac.uk/home/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Roehampton</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>A culture of \"presenteeism\" appears to have crept into the workplace. This was highlighted in a <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/pressoffice/press-releases/fall-absence-levels-could-masking-deeper-problems-workplace-091012.aspx\" title=\"CIPD: Fall in absence levels could be masking deeper problems in the workplace\">report from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development</a> (CIPD), which showed that over the past year almost a third of employers said they had seen an increase in the number of staff who turned up to work unwell. At the same time the average number of sick days taken by workers dropped from 7.7 days in 2011 to 6.8 days in 2012.</p> <p>The report suggested staff are increasingly going to work when they are ill rather than risk their job security against a background of redundancies in the workplace. Pulling a \"sickie\" may have been put on the back burner \u2013 at least for now.</p> <p>But are these concerns well founded? Yes, they are. Many employers will use staff absenteeism as one of the selection criteria for determining who is to be made redundant. Indeed, the CIPD report highlighted that half of those they polled used their workers' \"employee absence record\" when deciding who to get rid of.</p> <p>It is, though, a difficult one for employers and employees alike. If you are genuinely ill, are you doing your employer and work colleagues a disservice by coming into work and possibly spreading your germs, all in the name of commitment? This is without even considering how productive you are likely to be and whether you might make mistakes in your work. These concerns were also highlighted in the CIPD report.</p> <p>The study also found that stress-related absences and mental health problems were on the rise. I can well believe this. I have seen a significant increase in inquiries in the past year from employees suffering from work-related illness, largely caused by either being overworked or because of dire relationship issues with their managers. In many cases, those suffering with stress have already been put on a \"performance improvement plan\" by employers increasingly striving to maximise their workforce in this economic climate.</p> <p>If you are suffering with work-related stress the concept of \"presenteeism\" is less likely to apply to you. How can you present yourself for work in the very environment that is causing the stress? And yet, you could find yourself out on a limb in a redundancy selection process where your scorings will be adversely affected by your being absent.</p> <p>In these circumstances, you are best advised to protect your position by lodging an internal grievance against your employer as soon as you can, or by challenging your performance improvement plan \u2013 in both cases as long as you believe you are justified in doing so. This means if you are subsequently selected for redundancy you will have put down a marker beforehand. Your employer will not have a \"clear run\" to use your absenteeism as the main reason for your redundancy, because issues will have been raised by you beforehand.</p> <p>Of course, whether or not you agree with your employer about your performance issues, it is always possible to negotiate an exit under which you would leave with an agreed settlement package. Indeed, these types of discussions are being encouraged by the government as part of its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2012/sep/14/coalition-employment-law-plans\" title=\"Are the coalition's employment law plans bad news for workers?\">employment law reforms</a>.</p> <p>It is perfectly understandable why those who are at risk do not want to give their employers an opportunity to use their sickness record against them, whether in terms of a redundancy selection or otherwise. It is a shame for those workers who are genuinely ill, however, that they feel they have to struggle to work nevertheless. It's definitely a sign of the times.</p> <p>Have you ever gone into work when you were ill, and was your boss grateful? Or have any of your work colleagues come to work unwell when you wish they hadn't?</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Philip Landau is an employment lawyer with </em><a href=\"http://www.lzwlaw.co.uk/documents/philip_landau.htm\" title=\"Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors website\"><em>Landau Zeffertt Weir Solicitors</em></a></p>",
  "<p>A Chinese former official who won <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/11/china-environmental-press-awards\" title=\"\">an award for his expos\u00e9 of illegal forest clearing</a> has gone on trial accused of profiting by printing his books on environmental conflicts without proper licences.</p> <p>Liu Futang won the environmental press award, co-organised by the Guardian, in April. Three months later the 65-year-old was detained while receiving treatment for high blood pressure and diabetes at a hospital in southern Hainan province.</p> <p>His trial opened in Longhua, Haikou city, on Thursday morning. He is accused of \"conducting illegal business\", and supporters say he could face five years or more in jail. They believe that his last book, The Tears of Hainan II, particularly angered authorities. It highlighted a project to build a coal-fired power plant at Yinggehai, which met fierce opposition from residents.</p> <p>Prosecutors claim Liu ignored the law by illegally publishing, printing and distributing a total of 18,000 copies of his books. They acknowledge that he gave away the books, but argue that the total amount of money involved in the scheme was 464,000 yuan (\u00a346,100), and claim Liu illegally obtained 78,000 yuan.</p> <p>Feng Yongfeng, founder of NGO Green Beagle and one of the judges of this year's award, wrote on his microblog that Hainan prosecutors should withdraw the case, as there was no way it could be considered illegal business since Liu had published the books primarily to give to people.</p> <p>\"The purpose was sharing the difficulties of environmental protection. He never wanted to sell it \u2026 The circulation could only be useful to spread knowledge of environmental protection, not to have any impact in terms of the market,\" he said. \"Liu Futang has recognised his mistake on illegal publication and will learn from his experience.\"</p> <p>Xia Jun, a public interest lawyer, wrote on his microblog that the defence might be able to win the activist a two-year term or even a suspended sentence by stressing that he had been seeking to protect the environment.</p> <p>Liu's wife and son and one of his friends were allowed to witness the trial. Relatives had not been able to see him prior to the hearing. His niece, Liu Xiuli, said the activist had appeared in poor health and they were very concerned about his mental and physical wellbeing. She said he had been too emotional to speak at times during the case.</p> <p>Liu won the citizen journalist prize in the <a href=\"http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4866\" title=\"\">China environmental press awards this spring</a> after he revealed that developers of a yacht marina had destroyed one of the world's last groves of water coconut trees. He <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/11/china-environmental-press-awards\" title=\"\">told the Guardian</a> at the time: \"The degradation is terrible \u2026 The local media hasn't written a single word, but I've posted 40 articles that have been followed up by newspapers and TV from across the country.\"</p> <p>The awards are jointly organised by the Guardian, chinadialogue and the Chinese web portal Sina, with funding from the Guardian Foundation and SEE, a Chinese charitable body.</p>",
  "<p>The head of the International Monetary Fund has called on governments to co-operate to heal a fractured global economy or risk a further slowdown in economic growth.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde warned that only with greater co-operation and courage could governments hope to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis.</p> <p>In a speech to the IMF's annual meeting in Tokyo, Lagarde said banking regulators had told her that reforms of the financial system were incomplete and in many cases banks were as unsafe as before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p> <p>She said policymakers needed to take immediate action to resolve issues hanging over from the financial crisis.</p> <p>Europe has come under fire for its failure to end the debt crisis in the euro currency union. Leaders in the US and Asia have become frustrated at delays in agreeing measures to bolster Greece, Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>Largarde avoided direct criticism of eurozone leaders but warned that only swift action could end the uncertainty that is hitting economies across the world.</p> <p>The IMF cut its global growth forecast this week for the second time since April. Lagarde said Asian economies had been some of the hardest hit by the slowdown that most analysts believe follows the failure of European leaders to deal with the debt crisis.</p> <p>Lagarde said: \"We expect action and we expect courageous and co-operative action on the part of our members.\"</p> <p>The IMF has expressed frustration with Europe's piecemeal response to its debt crisis and warned that a recent respite in borrowing costs for debt-laden countries such as Spain may prove short-lived unless eurozone leaders come up with a comprehensive and credible plan.</p> <p>Standard &amp; Poor's cut its crdit rating on Spain on Wednesday to a level just above junk territory, and Moody's may soon follow.</p> <p>The IMF itself has come under fire after it admitted in its World Economic Outlook report that officials underestimated the effects of austerity measures on economic growth.</p> <p>The report found that previous estimates that for every \u00a31 of spending cuts the economy shrank by 50p were wrong and the economy shrank by around \u00a31.30 instead.</p> <p>The IMF was a strong supporter of austerity measures adopted by Western countries, including the UK, in the aftermath of the financial crisis.</p> <p>Most countries that adopted austerity programmes have missed their deficit reduction targets after a sharp slowdown in economic growth hit tax revenues and private sector activity.</p> <p>The IMF has U-turned in recent months and urged government to allow their austerity reforms to be planned over a longer period to lessen the impact on growth.</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to admit next month he has missed at least one of his key deficit reduction targets at his Autumn Statement. He has already announced an extension of the government rolling five-year austerity regime to 2018.</p> <p>Lagarde said she backed the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, who argued it was necessary to pursue government spending cuts or risk a backlash from international money markets and a rise in borrowing costs.</p> <p>Oxfam said there was a danger that the IMF's focus on the eurozone risked losing sight of the effects of the economic slowdown on the poorest. \"It's imperative that the poorest countries are not overlooked at this meeting. Europe's crisis needs to be fixed because the fallout is seriously threatening developing countries.</p> <p>\"Oxfam's research shows a Eurozone breakup could cost the world's poorest countries $30bn in lost trade and foreign investment. The IMF must work with poor countries to keep their fragile growth going, and to boost counter-cyclical spending essential for social stability and growth.\"</p> <p>The IMF is also under pressure from member states in the developing world who want greater representation on its governing board. Its 188 member countries meet on Friday and Saturday, and are expected to fall short of a goal to implement voting reforms that would give large emerging economies greater say and elevate China to the number three spot in IMF power.</p> <p>A territorial dispute between Japan and China added another element of disharmony. China's top central bank and finance ministry officials backed out of the meetings and sent deputies to Tokyo instead.</p> <p>China has objected to the purchase by Japan of the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, which it has claimed since the 1970s.</p> <p>Lagarde said she hoped the world's second and third-largest economies could resolve their differences \"harmoniously and expeditiously.\" \"I think they lose out by not attending the meeting,\" she said of the Chinese officials. \"And they will be missing something great.\"</p>",
  "<p>Human beings are restless, nosey and aggressive. These characteristics have made us one of the most invasive species our planet has ever encountered and allowed us to colonise nearly every terrestrial environment. During this progress, humans have made many acquisitions, several of them unwanted. Our constant movement between vast, populous cities and novel environments makes us easy prey for opportunistic pathogens that replicate fast, and transmit by sneezes and dirty hands before sickness even begins to show. These pathogens can spread around the world in hours by aeroplane to infect the unsuspecting on another continent. That's how <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/physical_health/conditions/swineflumulti1.shtml#the_2009_swine_flu_pandemic\" title=\"\">\"swine flu\" spread in 2009</a>; it was already unstoppable by the time we noticed it. We were lucky it wasn't particularly virulent.</p> <p>David Quammen's <em>Spillover</em> is a collection of stories about the sources of diseases called <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/biosafety/diseases/zoonoses.htm\" title=\"\">zoonoses</a>. These are the infections that humans acquire from other animals; the most notorious recent example is HIV/Aids, but they encompass a huge range of viruses, bacteria and parasites, including Ebola,&#xa0;some malarias and Q fever. It seems that zoonoses are increasing, at least reports of them are. In 2012 alone,&#xa0;hantavirus (a Sars-like virus), <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/campaigns/farmsafe/ecoli.htm\" title=\"\">E coli O157</a> and legionnaires' disease have hit the headlines \u2013 all originated in other animals.</p> <p>Quammen tells us we don't have far to look for blame when weird infectious diseases spring up: they usually result from humans moving into wild ecosystems or from forcing encounters with other species. Bats are at the centre of many of his stories; they seem to be a reservoir for a number of the nastier viruses \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/fact_sheets/fact_sheet_marburg_hemorrhagic_fever.pdf\" title=\"\">Marburg</a>, probably <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/Ebola_Fact_Booklet.pdf\" title=\"\">Ebola</a>, <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs262/en/\" title=\"\">Nipah</a> and Hendra viruses \u2013 as well as a source of bacterial and fungal infections. Bats are excellent crucibles for pathogens because they often live in huge numbers at high densities, roost in tight proximity and, in part because of habitat loss, congregate around human settlements. Bats could have provided cavemen and women with measles and mumps too. Another particularly acquisitive period in human evolution was probably livestock domestication about 10,000 years ago. This seems to have been the major trigger not just for human civilisation, but also for the accumulation of the familiar repertoire of communicable human diseases.</p> <p>If they are not made locally extinct by our activities, other animal species either hang on at the fringes of human settlements, or take to suburban living. In the US, homes in woodland idylls are aspirational dwellings, but the human invasion has made Lyme disease a widespread problem. Having lost their own space, the wild reservoir hosts of this bacterial infection \u2013 mice and deer, with their tick vectors \u2013 are forced to colonise the newly made backyards and come into contact with humans. Likewise, intimate living with rats in chaotic medieval cities allowed plague to spread worldwide, and as rat populations thrive in modern cities too, it wouldn't take much of a drop in living standards to give plague a new foothold.</p> <p>Smaller, highly mobile creatures also bring unwanted pathogens into human spaces. Mosquitoes can make the transition from forest to city living strikingly easily. They ride in planes and have taken with them terrible afflictions, such as <a href=\"http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/west_nile_virus/\" title=\"\">West Nile virus</a> to the US, and have spread dengue virus in Asia and South America. Mosquitoes breed fast, are genetically flexible, and can adapt rapidly to change their feeding and flying behaviour, tolerate climate shifts and develop insecticide resistance. Some are adept at breeding in almost any drop of uncovered water, for instance in an old tin can, a discarded tyre, or a hollow plant stem. This way,<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2134583/Huge-Asian-tiger-mosquitoes-poised-invade-UK--bring-deadly-diseases-dengue-fever-them.html\" title=\"\"> Asian tiger mosquitoes have spread to Europe</a>, where they now breed and are known to have transmitted chikungunya virus to Italy.</p> <p>Quammen has not considered \u2013 perhaps because we have only recently had the technology to witness it \u2013 the extraordinary amount of gene swapping among pathogens. Some of the most mobile of these genes supply components for antibiotic resistance and virulence, and may help a pathogen to change its host. This genetic movement, in combination with the profligate use of antibiotics, has now rendered a large armamentarium of once life-saving drugs useless.</p> <p>Zoonosis is a topic that, like the pathogens themselves, is hard to keep under control, and Quammen's treatment is rather uneven. Perhaps unsurprisingly, he veers from inflamed alarmism to cold, sober mathematics. I started off feeling irritated by asides such as \"Here's what you have to come to understand \u2026\" But he is terrific when on a quest to uncover the circumstances that led to a particular spillover event. The stories of the victims and the scientists are told in astonishing detail. He has named nearly all the local heroes of epidemiology and made several forays into west Africa in the process. He's at his best towards the end of the book in the section devoted to HIV, although soon afterwards he becomes so impassioned he inserts long flights of fictional fancy about the \"Voyager\" who brings HIV into the wider world. The book needed fiercer editing.</p> <p>Like bats, humans now live together in huge numbers, tightly packed and forever flitting from place to place. We are prime candidates for, as Quammen puts it, the Next Big One. What will it be? Perhaps an RNA virus, like the one portrayed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/03/contagion-steven-soderbergh-review\" title=\"\">Steven Soderbergh's film <em>Contagion</em></a>, but probably one more banal \u2013 influenza. Again though, we can teeter from the routine consideration of seasonal influenza (which still kills thousands of people each year) to scaremongering about bird flu (which has so far killed only a few hundred \u2013 though more than half of those infected died).</p> <p>The problem is that, for all its apparent simplicity, the flu virus hides its secrets well. It is constantly changing to acquire and shed mutations, at the same time gaining and losing virulence and shifting host adaptability. Making the annual vaccine for seasonal flu is an industrial-scale challenge of diplomacy and logistics, masterminded by the World Health Organisation. Influenza drugs are poor and resistance to them builds up quickly during an epidemic. So although we know a lot about flu, there is a lot more we don't know. We can't predict with much accuracy when the next spillover from birds will happen, whether or not it will spawn a devastating pandemic killing tens of millions, or where, how and what subtype it will be. We only know we still don't have the surveillance systems in place to stop it in time.</p>",

In the app market, both women and men commonly download free apps for games, social networking, music and weather. Men download more paid apps across all categories.</p> <p> I've certainly found in my own experience as a designer that women tend to place less emphasis on having so-many thousand apps or impressive speeds and feeds.

  "<p>A group of 23 impoverished west African fishing communities has driven off a fleet of illegal, unreported and unregulated \"pirate\" trawlers by filming and reporting them when they are found in their waters.</p> <p>In the 18 months since the London-based <a href=\"http://ejfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Environment Justice Foundation (EJF)</a> raised the \u00a350,000 needed to buy and equip a small seven-metre community surveillance boat for villages in the Sherbro river area of Sierra Leone, local fishers have filmed and identified 10 international trawlers working illegally in their protected waters and have made 252 separate reports of illegal fishing.</p> <p>Images of the pirate ships and their GPS positions are analysed to establish the identity of the vessels and the evidence is passed on to European Union (EU) and African governments, fishing ports and other communities. Nine of the 10 ships identified by the Sierra Leonean communities were found to have licences to export their catches to Europe.</p> <p>The effect of communities policing their own waters has been spectacular, says EJF in a new report on pirate fishing in west Africa. More than US$500,000 in fines has been collected from the vessel owners, $6m worth of fish has been seized and none of the vessels has been reported in Sierra Leone's inshore exclusion zone for six months.</p> <p>In addition, it says, Panama and Korea, whose vessels have been repeatedly identified fishing illegally in Sierra Leonean waters, have agreed to act on the information provided by the communities.</p> <p>\"A clampdown in one area can lead to overfishing elsewhere. So we see the need for a number of these boats along the coast. Fishermen are the best eyes and ears when it comes to illegal fishing,\" said Andy Hickman, an EJF campaigner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/51133202?title=1&amp;amp;byline=1&amp;amp;portrait=1\"> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/51133202?title=1&amp;byline=1&amp;portrait=1\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/51133202\">Pirate Fishing Exposed - The Fight against Illegal Fishing in West Africa and the EU (4 minute)</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/ejfoundation\">Environmental Justice Foundation</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p> </figure>  <p>The west African coast has been plagued for 20 years with massive international trawlers that are able to scoop up hundreds of tonnes of fish a day and export their illegal catch to Europe, at the expense of local fishermen who use 8m open pirogues (small flat-bottomed boats). The foreign trawlers, that are meant to stay outside the 12-mile limit, come in much closer at night because few west African countries have the money to monitor or police their waters.</p> <p>\"Along with the economic losses, pirate fishing in the region severely compromises the food security and livelihoods of coastal communities. In Sierra Leone, fish represents nearly two-thirds of the total animal protein consumed in the country,\" says the report.</p> <p>Anger at the activities of pirate fishing vessels is now boiling over. According to the report, countries like Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea and Ghana have the highest levels of illegal fishing in the world with nearly one-third of the total catch being taken illegally.</p> <p>Earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/04/senegal-revokes-licences-foreign-fishing-vessels\" title=\"\">Senegal cancelled the licences of 29 foreign fishing trawlers</a>, demanding that they offload their catches in the capital Dakar before leaving its territorial waters. The move followed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/apr/02/senegal-fishing-community-act-foreign-fleets?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">threats of direct action</a> by the country's 52,000 small-scale inshore fishermen against the owners of foreign trawlers.</p> <p>EJF is calling on the EU to tighten up its regulations, blacklist companies that have been shown to have repeatedly fished illegally and prevent illegally caught fish from entering the European seafood market.</p> <p>\"The EU is the world's largest importer of fish. It has a crucial responsibility to combat illegal fishing around the world, particularly in vulnerable countries where fish is a vital source of food security, employment and income,\" said Hickman.</p>"
