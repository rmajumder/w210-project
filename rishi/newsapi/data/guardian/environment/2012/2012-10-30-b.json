  "<p>Imagine one of Britain's most senior financial policymakers \u2013 a man sometimes tipped as a possible future governor of the Bank of England \u2013 speaking at a debate organised by Occupy protesters, famous for their excoriating criticism of contemporary capitalism. Now boldly entertain the idea that this regulator of banks might actually claim that Occupy is right. Well, speculate no longer, because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/bank-of-england-occupy-movement\" title=\"\">this event leapt from fantasy to reality this week</a>.</p> <p>At an event organised by Occupy Economics, Andy Haldane, the Bank's executive director for financial stability, claimed the movement best known for last year's protest camps in the City and on Wall Street had helped start \"<a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2012/616.aspx\" title=\"\">a reformation of finance</a>\". More than that: he declared their arguments about the ever-growing gap between the top 1% and the rest of us to be \"right\": \"At the heart of the global financial crisis, were and are problems of deep and rising inequality.\" Moreover, he acknowledged that, far from having closed during the biggest financial crash since 1929, the wealth gap continued to gape. \"We have seen, first, inequality-induced crisis and, latterly, crisis-induced inequality.\"</p> <p>Mr Haldane is one of the most interesting thinkers in financial economics, but on this point he is backed up by researchers at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/03/wealth-gap-heralds-meltdown\" title=\"\">IMF, rightwingers at the University of Chicago</a> and many others. One of the world's leading scholars on economic inequality, Berkeley's Emmanuel Saez, published a paper this March on <a href=\"http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2010.pdf\" title=\"\">how Americans were faring in the recovery from the Great Recession</a>. In 2010, the economist calculated, the 1% saw their incomes soar by 11.6%; the incomes of the other 99% grew only 0.2%. For the British translation of this story, look at the <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Resolution Foundation</a>'s report on living standards. It shows that take-home pay grew 2.7% a year for most of the postwar period; in the past decade it inched up only 0.6% a year. To emphasise the point that it is those at the very top who have captured the vast majority of the gains, the Resolution Foundation estimates that even those in the top 10% (as opposed to the now infamous 1%) have seen their incomes stagnate since 2001.</p> <p>From all of this flows one observation and one question. The observation is a simple one: in meeting Occupy protesters, Mr Haldane has gone further than any frontbench politician. Ed Miliband and Vince Cable sympathise with the demonstrators \u2013 but their most serious allies have been Mr Haldane and Adair Turner (with his criticism of \"socially useless\" banking). In this crisis, the technocrats are braver than the MPs. But, understandably, they frame this problem as being about culture and regulation rather than lobbying and ideology. When will we realise that this grotesque, dangerous apparently economic problem demands a full-bore political solution?</p>",

That's certainly the spirit of David Cameron and George Osborne's Britain. Five years into the crisis, the British economy has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">just edged out of its third downturn</a>, but construction is still reeling from government cuts and most people's living standards are falling.</p> <p>Those at the sharp end are being hit hardest: from cuts to disability and housing benefits, tax credits and the educational maintenance allowance and now increases in council tax while NHS waiting lists are lengthening, food banks are mushrooming across the country and charities report <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/two-children-in-every-classroom-go-hungry-as-neglect-takes-its-toll-7912679.html\" title=\"\">sharp increases in the number of children going hungry</a>. All this to pay for the collapse in corporate investment and tax revenues triggered by the greatest crash since the 30s.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum though, things are going swimmingly. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/27/not-so-rich-any-more-list\" title=\"\">richest 1,000 people in Britain have seen their wealth increase by \u00a3155bn since the crisis began</a> \u2013 more than enough to pay off the whole government deficit of \u00a3119bn at a stroke. Anyone earning over \u00a31m a year can look forward to a \u00a342,000 tax cut in the spring, while firms have been rewarded with a 2% cut in corporation tax to 24%.</p> <p>Not that many of them pay anything like that, even now. The scale of tax avoidance by high-street brand multinationals has now become clear, <a href=\"http://www.ukuncut.org.uk/blog/press-release-uk-uncut-demand-government-reject-lord-finks-call-for-uk-to-become-a-tax-haven-and-take-urgent-steps-to-prevent-billions-being-lost-through-tax-avoidance\" title=\"\">in no small part thanks to campaigning groups such as UK Uncut</a>. Asda, Google, Apple, eBay, Ikea, Starbucks, Vodafone: all pay minimal tax on massive UK revenues, mostly by diverting profits earned in Britain to their parent companies, or lower tax jurisdictions via royalty and service payments or transfer pricing.</p> <p>Four US companies \u2013 Amazon, Facebook, Google and Starbucks \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/uk-tax-rules-profit-global-firm\" title=\"\">have paid just \u00a330m tax on sales of \u00a33.1bn over the last four years</a>, according to a Guardian analysis. Apple is estimated to have avoided over \u00a3550m in tax on more than \u00a32bn worth of underlying profits in Britain by channelling business through Ireland, according to a Sunday Times analysis, while Starbucks has paid no corporation tax in Britain for the last three years.</p> <p>The Tory MP and tax lawyer Charlie Elphicke estimates 19 US-owned multinationals are paying an effective tax rate of 3% on British profits, instead of the standard rate of 26%. It's all entirely legal, of course. But taken together with the multiple individual tax scams of the elite, this roll call of corporate infamy has become an intolerable scandal, when taxes are rising and jobs, benefits and pay being cut for the majority.</p> <p>Not only that, but collecting the taxes that these companies have wriggled out of would go a long way to shrinking the deficit for which working- and middle-class Britain's living standards are being sacrificed. The total tax gap between what's owed and collected has been estimated by Richard Murphy of Tax Research UK at \u00a3120bn a year: \u00a325bn in legal tax avoidance, \u00a370bn in fraudulent tax evasion and \u00a325bn in late payments.</p> <p>Revenue and Customs' own last guess of \u00a335bn has been widely recognised as a serious underestimate. But even allowing for the fact that it would never be possible to close the entire gap, those figures give a sense of what resources could be mobilised with a determined crackdown. Set them, for instance, against the \u00a383bn in cuts planned for this parliament (including \u00a318bn in welfare) \u2013 or the \u00a31.2bn estimated annual benefit fraud bill \u2013 and you get a sense of what's at stake.</p> <p>Cameron and Osborne wring their hands at the \"moral repugnance\" of \"aggressive avoidance\", but are doing nothing serious about it whatever. They've been toying with a general \"anti-abuse\" principle. But it would only catch a handful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/20/jimmy-carr-tax-david-cameron\" title=\"\">of the kind of personal dodges the comedian Jimmy Carr signed up to</a>, not the massive profit-shuffling corporate giants have been dining off.</p> <p>Meanwhile, ministers are absurdly slashing the tax inspection workforce, and even introducing a new incentive for British multinationals to move their operations inbusiness to overseas tax havens. The scheme would, <a href=\"http://www.kpmg.com/channelislands/en/Documents/Budget-March-2012-commentary.pdf\" title=\"\">accountants KPMG have been advising clients</a>, offer an \"<a href=\"http://www.taxjournal.com/tj/articles/corporation-tax-55-almost-government-approved-avoidance-44591\" title=\"\">effective UK tax rate of 5.5%</a>\" from 2014 (and cut British tax revenues into the bargain).</p> <p>It's not as if there aren't any number of measures that would plug the loopholes and slash tax avoidance and evasion. They include a general anti-avoidance principle (<a href=\"http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/09/10/available-this-friday-a-genuine-general-anti-tax-avoidance-principle-for-the-uk/\" title=\"\">of the kind the Labour MP Michael Meacher has been pushing in a private member's bill</a>) that would outlaw any transaction whose primary purpose was avoidance rather than economic; minimum tax (backed even by the Conservative Elphicke); and country-by-country financial reporting, and unitary taxation, to expose transfer pricing and limit profit-siphoning.</p> <p>The latter would work better with&#xa0;international agreement. But there is already majority support in the&#xa0;European Union, and it is governments in countries such as Britain \u2013 where the City is itself a tax haven \u2013 that are&#xa0;resisting reform. When you realise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/20/hmrc-tax-avoidance-industry\" title=\"\">how&#xa0;closely the tax avoidance industry is tied up with government and drawing up tax law</a>, that's perhaps not&#xa0;so surprising.</p> <p>But when austerity and cuts are sucking demand out of the economy, fuelling poverty and joblessness and actually widening the deficit, the need to step up the pressure for corporations and the wealthy to pay their share&#xa0;as part of a wider recovery strategy couldn't be more obvious.</p> <p>The target has to shift from \"welfare scroungers\" to tax dodgers, and the campaign go national.

  "<p>Britain faces a choice between a generation of stagnant living standards for millions of lower-income households, or an alternative that tackles low pay, low skills, and childcare costs, according to a landmark report written by the Commission on Living Standards.</p> <p>In one of its key proposals, it suggests helping \"the missing million\" women back into the workforce by offering an extra 10 hours of childcare a week at \u00a31 an hour, a move which would cost&#xa0;\u00a32.2bn.</p> <p>The commission is remarkable for reaching such a consensus on the long-term structural problems facing the UK economy, as it is made up of a diverse group of leading bankers, industrialists, trade unionists and economists.</p> <p>The authors, who include the TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, state that \"the balance of income growth now needs to shift away from rising state support towards increasing employment income\". The report is likely to fuel debate across the political spectrum, with tough messages for all sides, both in its analyses and solutions.</p> <p>One consequence is likely to be an intensified debate at the election about how to fund childcare.</p> <p>The commission, chaired by the businessman Clive Cowdery, says that \"historic circumstance, policy choice and global trends mean the UK has arrived at an economic model in which only a relatively small proportion of overall GDP growth trickles down to the bottom half of the population\". Inequality has risen across the western world as new technologies have boosted demand for skilled workers and union power has been eroded.</p> <p>The report finds that:</p> <p>\u2022 On current trends, a working-age household in the middle of the income distribution looks likely to have a disposable income in 2020 which is around 3% lower than it was it was in 2008. The figures for those in the bottom 10% of households are far worse, with a projected real-terms decline of 15%.</p> <p>\u2022 Only 12p of every \u00a31 of UK GDP now goes to wages in the bottom half of households, down 25% in the past three decades.</p> <p>\u2022 Incomes of low- to middle-income households grew by just 0.3% a year from 2003 to 2008, even when the economy grew by 1.4% a year.</p> <p>\u2022 The UK ranks 15th on the OECD scale on females in employment, behind Slovenia, largely due to under-employment of women in their early 30s.</p> <p>It also warns that tax credits \u2013 the Labour's government's method of preventing stagnating incomes \u2013 will no longer be able to act as a countervailing force owing to the need to cut the deficit. Between 2003 and 2008, tax credits and benefits added \u00a3730 a year to average income in low- and middle-income households, while combined income from other sources fell by \u00a3570. In roughly the same period, average income among the top 0.1% grew by 65% in real terms, at an annual rate of 13.4%.</p> <p>The report proposes a mix of policies to increase employment, tackle low pay and skill a workforce. The report It finds that the \"UK wastes vast amounts of potential productive capacity because work too often simply does not pay\".</p> <p>It calls for expansion of childcare to attract \"the missing million\" women back into the labour force. Free childcare places should be extended by 10 hours, to 25 hours a week for 47 weeks a year. The new hours should be charged at \u00a31 an hour, at a net cost of \u00a32.2bn. The report says that at present, a middle-income family receiving a gross income 87% higher than a low-income family actually ends up with a final income of only 17% higher due to childcare costs.</p> <p>The child tax element in universal credit should be \"front loaded\" to reflect desire for women with older children to work.</p> <p>In a bid to tackle low pay, the report proposes that the Low Pay Commission be empowered to undertake stress tests in sectors to suggest an affordable wage \u2013 as opposed to the current statutory minimum wage \u2013 that could be set without damaging jobs. Companies would also be required to publish the proportion of their workforce paid below thresholds such as the living wage. It suggests a living wage in low-pay sectors such as bars, restaurants and retail adds a significant 5% to the wage bill. But other areas such as banking, construction and computing would face a rise in 0.5% of the wage bill.</p> <p>Payment of a living wage would increase government revenues by around \u00a37bn as a result of reduced tax credit spending and increased tax receipts. Public sector wages would rise by just over \u00a33bn.</p> <p>On training and skills, the report warns it is \"untenable for the UK workforce to contain such a long tail of people without basic literacy and numeracy, leaving so many to languish in elementary service roles with little chance of progress on\". Many middle-skills jobs are set to disappear, requiring a more skilled workforce. The report calls for students to be required to study English and maths to 18 and to face a new standard exam at 18. It also calls for stronger bodies to license training.</p> <p>The report suggests three main sources of funding for its plans, mainly aimed at the affluent retired. It proposes restricting tax relief on pension pots for the most affluent from \u00a31.5m to \u00a31m; means-testing of the free universal winter fuel allowance and TV licences for pensioners; and extending national insurance contributions to those working beyond state pension age.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 October 2012. The original referred to restricting tax relief on pension pots for the most affluent from \u00a31.5bn to \u00a31bn rather than \u00a31.5m to \u00a31m. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The Guardian is to be congratulated for its forensic critique of government policy on Trident (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/trident-renewal-philip-hammond\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 30 October). In pointing out the compelling strategic, economic and moral arguments against Britain maintaining (let alone replacing) a nuclear weapons system, the absurdity of committing \u00a3100bn to Trident replacement is laid bare.</p> <p>But there is one further argument which needs to be made here: scrapping Trident is a vote winner \u2013 and this is something Labour and the Lib Dems must understand.</p> <p>The case must be made in no uncertain terms: would the public rather have essential services or a redundant weapons system? Do the military want usable equipment or an outmoded totem? And does the world need another hypocritical nuclear-armed state paying lip service to disarmament while ploughing billions into its nuclear arsenal?</p> <p>Domestically and internationally, Britain should be bold in rejecting nuclear weapons. They're indefensible and worthless \u2013 and who would want to defend that?<br><strong>Kate Hudson </strong><br><em>General secretary, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Why do not opponents of Trident take the straightforward, compelling and unanswerable stance that it is not Britain's to use? Trident's guidance system is controlled by the US, and the notion that Washington is going to allow its erstwhile colonial rulers to choose a target for such a devastating WMD is outside the realms of reality.</p> <p>The origins of this ludicrous situation go back to Trident's predecessor, Polaris, on which Harold Macmillan and his close ally John F Kennedy <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_Agreement\" title=\"\">made a deal at Nassau in 1962</a> for Britain to have a figleaf arrangement, masquerading as independent control, in order to assuage backbench Tory outrage over the US's unilateral abandonment of the Skybolt missile that was to be used in RAF bombers. Skybolt was flawed, but it would at least have been an independent system. Trident is the opposite.</p> <p>Your leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/29/nick-clegg-attacks-philip-hammond-trident\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg's criticisms</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/trident-miliband-brave-jump-ship\" title=\"\">Polly Toynbee's Comment piece</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cartoon/2012/oct/29/philip-hammond-nick-clegg-trident?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Martin Rowson's typically brilliant cartoon</a> all missed the chance to nail the pretence that Trident is independent.<br><strong>John Webster </strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Trident is neither British nor independent, and it isn't much of a deterrent. And hardly a bargain. Evidence to the Commons defence select committee demonstrated that Trident depends crucially for launch and target acquisition data on US military GPS satnav. You can be sure that if we tried to do something the White House didn't approve, the satnav would be switched off. <br><strong>Peter Johnston</strong><br><em>Bolton, Lancashire </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008In 1986, the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, said: \"The accident at Chernobyl showed again what an abyss will open if nuclear war befalls mankind.\" He later said it was that accident that triggered the end of the cold war. As long as there are nuclear power stations in the world the deterrent value of nuclear weapons is illusory. In a nuclear war the real damage will be caused by uncontrollable emissions of radioactive material from nuclear reactors and their associated storage zones.</p> <p>Britain has plenty of nuclear power stations. As the prevailing winds in Britain are southwesterly, the likely victims of any attack on us will be to our east: Russia and China, the presumed objects of Trident. They have nuclear power stations, too. If Trident were ever to be used, the entire northern hemisphere would become uninhabitable. <br><strong>Craig Sams </strong><br><em>Hastings, East Sussex </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Philip Hammond's go-ahead for Trident replacement (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/29/tories-lib-dems-trident?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Tories snub Lib Dems over Trident future</a>, 29 October) is just a ploy to scupper Scottish independence. It has nothing to do with being the \"ultimate safeguard for Britain's security\". The US has 14 Trident submarines and none of that killing power prevented the attacks on New York and the Pentagon. Billions of pounds of public money are to be spent on a dangerous, destabilising weapon that will only increase the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons.<br><strong>Rae Street </strong><br><em>Littleborough, Lancashire </em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008The government claims a replacement for Trident is necessary for the creation of high-quality jobs and vital skills. This is profoundly depressing. To believe we have to invest in weapons of destruction is to totally ignore more peaceful and constructive investments, such as securing our energy needs through renewable energy or providing zero-carbon housing, hospitals and schools. We can develop high-quality jobs through ensuring a living wage, decent working hours, protection against unfair dismissal and so many other initiatives that this government considers unnecessary.<br><strong>Jean Lambert MEP</strong><br><em>Green, London</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Polly Toynbee and others should be urging Ed Miliband to make a referendum on the future of Trident a matter of Labour policy. This is an issue that concerns the kind of country (and world) we want our grandchildren to inherit; the spending priorities we want our politicians to attend to; and whether the kind of defence we want for our community needs to be quite so apocalyptic.</p> <p>The debate and discussion around such an issue would be a collective airing of both the rational and irrational, and could return democracy back to where it belongs \u2013 our peoples. It might also be a fitting tribute to the resolution of the Cuban missile crisis from which, thank God, we all came through.<br><strong>John Hills</strong><br><em>Canterbury, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008When is the Labour party going to stop being frightened of its own shadow on this issue?

  "<p>Ford has posted a third-quarter profit that trounced Wall Street forecasts, driven by higher vehicle prices and record profit margins of 12% in North America. The second-biggest US carmaker's strength in North America offset the effects of the sharp industry downturn in Europe \u2013 where Ford expects to lose at least $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) over the next two years \u2013 as well as its lagging position in growth markets, such as China.</p> <p>Last week the carmaker shed 6,200 jobs across the European continent with the closure of three sites including its Transit van factory in Southampton. Executives also left open the possibility of further actions if a recovery in Europe fails to materialise.</p> <p>Ford's strong showing in North America reflects the benefits of chief executive Alan Mulally's \"One Ford\" strategy to build more cars and trucks on five global platforms by the middle of the decade, from the current nine platforms. Chief financial officer Bob Shanks said that this plan will serve as a blueprint for Ford's restructuring of Europe, although he added that there are limits on how much Ford can draw from its past experiences.</p> <p>Ford of Europe is \"much, much leaner\" than the US operations were in 2006, Shanks said, adding: \"Europe isn't North America. It clearly has excess capacity \u2013 which we're addressing \u2013 but if you look in other areas, it's very lean.

  "<p>HBOS executives threatened and swore at colleagues who were investigating the risks being taken by the bank before it collapsed in the financial crisis, it has been claimed.</p> <p>Paul Moore, the former HBOS head of group regulatory risk who was sacked after raising concerns about the bank's management, made the claims during the latest session of the parliamentary commission on banking standards.</p> <p>\"When I tried to resolve the previous difficulties with Jo Dawson [HBOS group risk director 2004-2005 who eventually replaced Moore], she leant over the table \u2013 she stood up \u2013 pointed at me and said 'I'm warning you. Don't you make an effin' enemy out of me',\" he said.</p> <p>\"It demonstrated that if a senior executive thought it was perfectly OK to speak to the head of regulatory risk in that tone you can imagine how the culture spreads through the organisation.</p> <p>\"It didn't matter what you were doing, if your job was to check people out, there was behaviour that was threatening and unpleasant to people doing these [risk assessment] activities\".</p> <p>Moore also said that HBOS was \"worse than other environments [he'd] experienced\", that \"sales targets and bonuses [driven by former chief executive Sir James Crosby] were right at the heart\" of the bank's collapse and that the board appointed Carphone Warehouse founder Charles Dunstone as head of the retail bank's risk control committee when he had \"no technical expertise\".</p> <p>The comments are the latest from Moore on how he saw the collapse of the lender. In 2009 he told MPs he had been sacked for raising concerns about the lender's rapid growth in the years before the credit crunch while he has also submitted detailed reports to the Financial Services Authority on what went wrong. During Tuesday's appearance, he repeated many of his previous criticisms.</p> <p>After his dismissal, a report into Moore's allegations \u2013 commissioned from the bank's auditors, KPMG \u2013 concluded that he lost his job because of personality clashes inside the lender in 2004 and not that Crosby sacked him because of warnings that HBOS was \"going too fast\" and \"was a serious risk to financial stability and consumer protection\".</p> <p>Moore told the committee the accounting firm had concluded exactly what he expected. \"The KPMG report said I was a lunatic and they were right \u2013 in summary,\" he said.</p> <p>The committee also heard from Colin Matthew, the former chief executive of HBOS's international division, as well as Dawson.</p> <p>Members did not ask her about the alleged exchanges with Moore, but she told them of how \"one heard\" rumours that HBOS's corporate bank \u2013 which was largely blamed for the bank's demise \u2013 was less cautious than competitors in giving loans, although she said she had \"no ability to discern if people were jealous\".</p> <p>Dawson added: \"We had an annual management conference every year, the top 500 or so coming. In 2006, I think it would have been, Sir Philip Green came as the guest speaker and \u2026 was very positive about [the HBOS corporate bank's] understanding of business.\"</p> <p>The evidence came as the FSA prepares to kick off its own investigation into the collapse of HBOS.</p> <p>In December, the City regulator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/dec/12/royal-bank-of-scotland-fsa-report\" title=\"\">published its report into the near-collapse of Royal Bank of Scotland</a>, but had been delaying commencing its HBOS investigation until it had completed enforcement action against Peter Cummings, the former head of the bank's corporate division.

  "<p>Some people's hobby is bell-ringing, or campanology. MPs prefer hand-wringing, or moaning on to no apparent purpose. This is especially true during Foreign Office questions.

Thank heavens for Sir Peter Tapsell, who may have the bearing of an imperial gunboat, but is probably rather more rooted in the reality of the modern world than most other, younger, more idealistic MPs. Sir Peter's questions are usually brief, even terse. But this time he had a lengthy contribution to make and had written it out \u2013 or possibly had it cast by a small foundry on to a brass palimpsest.</p> <p>The gist of his contribution was that it had been a great mistake for the west to \"encourage\" the revolt against President Assad in Syria. Those who had risen against the regime now included the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Qaida, Hamas, various jihadists and similar ruffians.</p> <p>Given that the Russians were now desperate to stop the conflict spreading to the Caucasus, should we not try to reach an agreement with them? (The joy of Sir Peter is that he may be the only MP who knows where the Caucasus is, with the exception of Rory Stewart, who has probably walked across it with only a bar of Kendal mint cake.)</p> <p>William Hague has perhaps not yet realised that my enemy's enemy is not necessarily my friend, and may be even more of an enemy. He brushed Sir Peter aside \u2013 quite an achievement in itself; as easily brush aside the Churchill statue in Parliament Square \u2013 saying that the west had not \"encouraged\" the Syrians, who had risen up unencouraged.</p> <p>Soon afterwards they got on to Europe, with a brief exchange of fire about Wednesday's debate on the EU budget. At last, something we can do something about!</p>",
  "<p>In the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/financial-crisis\" title=\"\">2008 financial crisis</a> practically all European Union countries opted for the same strategy to put their finances back on track: cut spending; increase taxes; reduce deficits. Research published by economic thinktank NIESR this week makes the first attempt (to our knowledge) to estimate the impact of this co-ordinated fiscal consolidation across the EU. What we have found won't make for pleasant reading in the treasuries of European governments.</p> <p>In \"normal times\" fiscal consolidation would lead to a fall in debt-to-GDP ratios, but in the current circumstances it is likely to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2012/oct/17/eurozone-crisis-interactive-timeline-three-years\" title=\"\">self-defeating for the EU collectively</a>. As a result of the deficit cutting plans now in train, debt ratios will be higher in 2013 in the EU as a whole, rather than lower. This will also be true in almost all the individual states (with the exception of Ireland). Coordinated austerity in a depression is self-defeating. The implication is that the strategy being pursued by individual members, as well as the EU as a whole, is making matters worse.</p> <p>Why so? There are several reasons one might expect the negative impact of fiscal consolidation on growth to be greater now. Normally, monetary policy offsets some of the impact of fiscal policy. But interest rates are already at exceptionally low levels \u2013 and it is far from clear that extraordinary measures, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">quantitative easing</a> and the ECB's outright monetary transactions, are having much impact on the economy. Second, during a downturn, when unemployment is high and job security low, a greater percentage of households and firms are likely to find themselves without access to credit. And finally, with all countries consolidating simultaneously, output in each is reduced not just by fiscal consolidation, but by that in other countries (through trade links). In the EU, such spillover effects are likely to be large.</p> <p>Fiscal policy started to achieve the opposite of what was intended in 2011, when deep consolidation measures were introduced in Portugal, Ireland and Greece \u2013 the three countries on bail-out programmes. Cumulative measures over the three-year period amount to close to 10% of GDP in Greece and Portugal and 8% in Ireland. Consolidation measures amounting to between 5% and 6% of GDP are planned in France, Italy, Spain and the UK, while only a modest adjustment is likely in Germany and Austria.</p> <p>Our estimates are that in those normal times, fiscal consolidation would have reduced growth, but not by very much except in the bailout countries: the cumulative impact ranging from almost nothing in Germany to 8% in Greece and Portugal. The desired objective of reducing deficits and debt would have been achieved. But taking account of the current environment changes the picture dramatically: the hit to output in Germany is now 2%. In the UK it is 5%; and in Greece 13%. Still more shocking is the impact on debt-to-GDP ratios \u2013 the fiscal consolidation was supposed to improve fiscal sustainability; instead, it makes matters worse. And this isn't true just in extreme cases like Greece \u2013 fiscal consolidation across the EU has raised debt-to-GDP ratios in Germany and the UK as well. In both the UK and the euro area as a whole, the result of coordinated fiscal consolidation is a rise in the debt-GDP ratio of approximately five percentage points. For the UK, that means a debt-GDP ratio of close to 75% in 2013 instead of about 70%. We are not running to stand still; we are determinedly heading in the wrong direction.</p> <p>The policies pursued by EU countries over the recent past have had perverse and damaging effects. Of course, European countries did need to get back on the path of fiscal sustainability, and that does mean cutting spending and raising taxes. But timing is everything, and our research shows 2011 was precisely the wrong time. Waiting until economies were clearly on the road to recovery would have been less painful socially, and much better economically. Growth would have been higher, debt-GDP ratios lower, and the necessary adjustment smoother and less painful.</p> <p>What we have seen in Europe is the creation of a death spiral of deficit cutting, leading to reduced growth \u2013 which leads to reduced revenues and pressure to cut deficits faster. Paradoxically the EU was set up in part to avoid such problems by allowing members to co-operate to secure better outcomes. Co-ordinated EU fiscal consolidation looks less like economic policy co-operation and more like a suicide pact.</p>",
  "<p>Superstorm Sandy could cost up to $45bn in damage and lost production after it swept across America's east coast, wreaking far more havoc than hurricane Irene last year, economists say.</p> <p>While it will take weeks to count the cost, Sandy is likely to be among the most costly disasters in history and could slow down the American economy's momentum in the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Wall Street was closed for two days and few US companies released results, with knock-on effects on share trading in London. The devastation is a big worry for stocks and share prices are set to take a hit if trade resumes on Wall Street on Wednesday as planned. Insurance shares in London including Hiscox, Amlin and Catlin, which slipped on Monday, regained some ground.</p> <p>Sandy left behind a trail of damage \u2013 homes underwater, trees toppled and power lines downed \u2013 while New York's subway system was flooded, the worst disaster in its 108-year history.</p> <p>The US economists Gregory Daco and Nigel Gault at IHS Global Insight estimate Sandy will cause $10bn of insured losses to infrastructure and twice as much in terms of total damages. Irene left behind it a $15bn path of destruction across 13 states last year. But the researchers warned that the much bigger Sandy was likely to end up causing more flooding damage.</p> <p>The superstorm has also forced 70% of the east coast's oil refineries to shut down, which will put up gasoline prices in coming days. Its commercial impact is likely to be worse than that of Irene, which hit on a Sunday, while Sandy hit the east coast on a Monday. Economic losses caused by business shutdowns and a slump in consumption could easily outweigh infrastructure damage.</p> <p>Mohammad Khan, insurance partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers, estimated total economic losses from Sandy at $45bn, taking the 1938 New England storm as a proxy, and warned of higher insurance premiums. \"Will hurricane Sandy impact insurance premiums? If losses are in the range of $10-$20bn, there may be a short knock-on effect. A loss double that size, however, is more likely to raise premiums globally, as was the case with other events such as hurricane Andrew, 9/11 and hurricane Katrina.\"</p> <p>The $45bn estimate pales in comparison with hurricane Katrina, which caused $120bn of damage in 2005, while the cost of last year's earthquake in Japan was more than $200bn.</p> <p>\"The effect on growth for the fourth quarter will not be catastrophic but might still be noticeable, especially in an economy with little momentum anyway,\" the IHS economists said. \"Suppose that the affected regions lose just 25% of their overall output for two days that is not recoverable later. That would knock about $25bn annualised ($6bn actual) off GDP, and could take as much as 0.6 percentage points off the annualised fourth-quarter real GDP growth rate.\"</p> <p>The economics consultancy Capital Economics reckons Sandy's economic impact is likely to be small in the long run because the effects of the infrastructure damage and power outages will be offset to some extent by the massive clean-up that will follow. Paul Ashworth, the chief US economist, said the impact could be quite large initially because the 12 affected states account for nearly a quarter of national GDP, with the New York area alone accounting for a tenth.</p> <p>If all output was lost for two days, the economic loss would be about 0.7% for the fourth quarter \u2013 but this would be largely offset by the resulting clean-up. The overall impact on GDP growth could even be positive, he said, as households and businesses sweep up the damage.</p> <p>The credit ratings agency Fitch said losses related to Sandy would be largely borne by primary insurers such as State Farm, Allstate, Liberty Mutual Group and Travelers. Christopher Grimes, senior director of insurance, said losses were likely to be similar to hurricane Irene, which cost insurers $4-5bn.</p>",
  "<p>UBS will axe up to 3,000 jobs in its London offices, in one of the biggest banking bloodbaths since the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>The move to halve the Swiss bank's workforce in London is part of a global cull of up to 10,000 jobs, as UBS dramatically shrinks its troubled investment bank. The division suffered huge losses in the financial crisis and has since been engulfed in scandal, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/30/ubs-trader-encouraged-billion-deals\" title=\"\">biggest rogue trading loss in British history</a> and traders suspended amid a Libor-rigging probe.</p> <p>The axe fell quickly with the bank immediately confirming 100 UBS staff in London lost their jobs on Tuesday. But, on a day heavy with rumour and speculation, sources said job losses in the capital were much higher, with at least 100 traders and half the bond sales team asked to leave.</p> <p>In scenes reminiscent of the dark days of the financial crisis, some turned up at the office to find their passes no longer worked. They were escorted to a side room where they received an impersonal letter that began \"Dear Colleague\". In it they were told they had been placed on \"special leave\" and were asked to stay away from the office until further notice.</p> <p>The City has been hit with a wave of cost cutting as investment banks grapple with a dearth of deals and tougher capital rules introduced since the financial crisis that have eroded profit margins.</p> <p>Last week Credit Suisse announced a new round of job cuts as part of a drive to save an extra 1 billion Swiss francs (\u00a3668m). Deutsche Bank \u2013 which employs more than 8,500 people in the UK \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/30/deutsche-bank-cut-jobs\" title=\"\">is slashing almost 2,000 jobs</a>, with the majority of the cuts in investment banking. Barclays and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale have both said they will shrink their trading operations, while bankers at Investec have accepted a cut of up to 15% in their basic salaries. Barclays is to report quarterly results on Wednesday.</p> <p>UBS said it was winding down fixed-income activities that were no longer profitable because of new capital rules and a weak market.</p> <p>The bank also has its own set of problems. Former UBS investment banker Kweku Adoboli is currently in court, accused of almost sinking the bank with illicit dealing. He denied on Monday that he had been a rogue trader when he ran up alleged losses of \u00a31.4bn.</p> <p>Separately UBS has suspended some of its most senior traders in connection with an international investigation into the manipulation of Libor. Earlier this year, the bank took a \u00a3227m hit from the botched stock market listing of Facebook, which it blamed on Nasdaq's \"gross mishandling\" of the flotation.</p> <p>On Tuesday UBS posted a loss of \u00a31.4bn for three months to September, compared with a profit of \u00a3670m a year ago. The bank took a one-off charge of \u00a32bn linked to the restructuring of its investment banking division and a debt-related charge of \u00a3574m.</p> <p>The restructuring, which UBS says will take place over three years, will leave it focused on wealth management, supported by a smaller investment bank specialising in equities trading, foreign exchange, precious metals, advisory work and research.</p> <p>Chief executive Sergio Ermotti said: \"This decision has been a difficult one, particularly in a business such as ours that is all about its people. Some reductions will result from natural attrition and we will take whatever measures we can to mitigate the overall effect.\"</p> <p>The cuts, however, were delivered with the brutality that has become typical of the City. Those dismissed in London received a letter, seen by the Telegraph, that read: \"You will not be required to continue to perform your current duties at this time \u2026 During this period of special leave, you should not enter the premises of UBS (or any of its operating divisions) unless you are asked to do so.\"</p> <p>Outside the offices, a recruitment consultant hovered in the hope of catching bankers on their way out. \"I'm probably being slightly predatory,\" he admitted. \"But I do genuinely want to try and find these people jobs.\"</p> <p>Some of those who lost their jobs took to Twitter to vent their anger, where the acronym for UBS \"U've Been Sacked\" made a comeback. It was invented in 1998 when the company fired hundreds of people following the merger of two Swiss banks.</p>",
  "<p>With climate change increasingly having a disastrous global impact, growing numbers of local communities are responding by launching their own renewable energy co-operatives in an effort to slash the UK's greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>In fact green energy co-ops are now one of the fastest growing parts of the UK co-operative sector having grown by 24% in the past four years.</p> <p>\"The first co-operatively-owned wind farm opened in Cumbria in 1997,\" explains Rebecca Willis, co-author of <a href=\"http://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/renewableenergy_0_0.pdf\" title=\"\">a report into co-operative renewable energy</a> published earlier this year.</p> <p>\"Since then, over 7,000 individual investors have ploughed over \u00a316 million into community-owned wind turbines and other renewable technologies resulting in that there are now over 40 co-operatively-run renewable energy projects across the UK.\"</p> <p>Typical of the motivation that lies behind this behind this surge in the numbers of renewable energy co-ops is that demonstrated by Mark Wells, a director of the newly-launched <a href=\"http://www.sheffieldrenewables.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sheffield Renewables co-op</a>: \"When we bring future generations to mind, ignoring the problem of climate change is not an option. So even though climate change is a very big problem, we want to do our bit, and so we chose to work as a community to build a renewable energy scheme.\"</p> <p>The co-op aims to build a hydro-electric generator on the river Don which will be the largest community-owned hydro scheme in England providing enough electricity to power 80 homes.</p> <p>The project is being funded by a share offer which aims to raise \u00a3200k and which will pay individual investors up to 3% interest.</p> <p>\"Investing in Sheffield Renewables is about much more than the financial return,\" cautions Wells. \"It's about working together to bring carbon-free local energy to the city with profits going back into more green initiatives. Plus once people become involved with the project they're more likely to think about climate change and start to reduce their own carbon footprint.\"</p> <p>Simon Gilhooly who helped launch the <a href=\"http://www.greenenergynayland.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Green Energy Nayland</a> project in Suffolk last year agrees that renewable energy projects are a great way to get the issue of climate change onto the agenda: \"We've installed a photo-voltaic system onto the roof of local primary school and this has really helped raise awareness of climate change within the school and the wider community.\"</p> <p>In the first year of their operation Gilhooly estimates that the school's solar panels has saved around \u00a31,000 in energy bills. The scheme has also generated an income of over \u00a34,000 through the government's <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">feed in tariff</a> resulting in that members who bought shares in the scheme are being paid a healthy level of interest on their investment.</p> <p>All of the UK's renewable energy co-ops have been funded through share issues that target individual ethically-minded investors.</p> <p>To help match up would-be investors with renewable energy projects a new website <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Microgenius</a> has been launched as its founder Emily Mackay explains: \"Microgenius is designed to simplify the process for both new renewable energy projects and investors. It has been specially developed to manage the administration of fundraising and to make it possible to reach a much wider range of people with the share offer.\"</p> <p>Another source of financial support for new co-ops is from the Co-operative Group. \"We have earmarked \u00a31 million to support the establishment of new renewable energy co-operatives through our <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/enterprisehub/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Enterprise Hub</a>,\" says Paul Monaghan, head of social goals and sustainability at the Co-operative Group. \"This provides free business support for new and existing co-operatives.\"</p> <p>So what are the key benefits of launching a renewable energy project as a co-op?</p> <p>\"One of the main advantages of co-operative structures is the strong message that the project is done by and for the community and is not imposed from the outside,\" answers Willis.</p> <p>This is exactly what the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Valley Wind</a> co-op in West Yorkshire has found whilst planning its wind farm in the Colne Valley.</p> <p>\"So far we've had a pretty positive response from the community to our plans,\" says Chayley Collis, spokesperson for Valley Wind.</p> <p>\"A big part of this is because we're a co-operative and so people feel that the wind farm is going to benefit the community and that it is something that they will be able to invest in.\"</p> <p>With opposition to wind farms growing around the country, the local paper in nearby Huddersfield ran a poll about the planned windfarm.</p> <p>\"Over 70% of respondents were in favour which is a fantastic vote for co-operative windfarms,\" says Collis.</p> <p>However despite the passion and dedication of the renewable energy co-op community, the sector contributes only a minute amount of energy to the National Grid and scaling up their numbers remains an uphill task.</p> <p>\"If the government put the right policies in place then renewable energy co-op schemes could generate electricity equivalent to three conventional power stations,\" says Willis.</p> <p>\"Currently though with its jungle of red-tape the market is designed to favour the established large-scale developments which have specialist teams to tackle the mountain of bureaucracy involved in bringing a scheme to market.\"</p> <p>One way that co-ops have been able to bypass this bureaucratic-nightmare is to team up with existing windfarm developers.</p> <p>In Scotland four community co-ops have been launched which now have a small stake in major windfarms that have been built by <a href=\"http://www.falckrenewables.eu\" title=\"\">Falk Renewables</a>, one of Europe's leading renewable energy companies.</p> <p>\"Community groups receive a pro rata per centage of energy production from the windfarm,\" explains Paul Phare from <a href=\"http://www.energy4all.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Energy4All</a> which works to develop renewable energy co-ops.</p> <p>\"It's an opportunity to engage everyone within the community, whether it be through a new playground paid for by the windfarm developer or as individuals who can personally benefit from investing in the wind farm scheme.\"</p> <p>One energy co-op which is aiming for the big time is <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Co-operative Energy</a>, part of the Co-op Group which launched in 2010.</p> <p>\"We aspire to being as big in energy as we are in banking,\" says Ben Reid from Co-op Energy.</p> <p>\"Most people feel completely disengaged about energy and mistrust their energy supplier. We aim to treat our customers fairly which is the hallmark of the co-operative brand and as with all co-operatives, members would be offered a share of profits,\" says Reid.</p> <p>\"If the original <a href=\"http://www.therochdalepioneers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Rochdale Pioneers</a> were starting up in business in 2011,\" Reid adds, \"then I'm convinced that it's the energy market they would choose.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>\"Green-on-blue\" attacks by Afghan forces on British and other foreign troops are an insurgent tactic that is difficult to deal with, a senior British commander has admitted to MPs.</p> <p>Lieutenant General David Capewell, the UK's joint forces commander, was giving evidence to the Commons cross-party defence committee, which also heard that British and other Nato forces would remain in Afghanistan beyond the 2014 deadline ending ground combat operations, though it is unclear in what form.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to deal with, but we are all determined to get to grips with this,\" Capewell said of the attacks on Nato troops by Afghan security forces. Better training, force protection and vetting \u2013 including psychological tests and biometric screening \u2013 were among the measures being introduced to try to prevent such attacks, he said. \"But you can never have a perfect system.\"</p> <p>Brigadier Doug Chalmers, who has just returned from commanding Britain's 9,500-strong force in Helmand province, told the MPs that Afghan commanders were \"equally shocked\" by the attacks. He said that after talking to British soldiers engaged in advising and training Afghan forces on the ground, he was sure the attacks had not dented their morale.</p> <p>Asked whether he seriously believed that Afghan forces would be sustainable once Nato-led troops gave up their ground combat role by 1 January 2015, Capewell replied that it was \"an assumption we have to make\". Asked who they would be loyal to, the general answered: \"I rather hope to the Afghan government.\"</p> <p>David Cameron has announced that the number of British troops in Afghanistan will be cut by 500 by the end of this year. Dame Mariot Leslie, Britain's ambassador to Nato, told the MPs that there may be an opportunity next year \"to make further withdrawals\", though she emphasised that no decision had yet been taken.</p> <p>However, she made clear that Nato had agreed in principle to maintain a military presence in Afghanistan beyond 2014 in addition to any bilateral arrangements made between individual countries and Kabul. Nato countries had recently agreed to an \"initiating directive\" paving the way for long-term help for Afghan forces from both Nato and non-Nato countries, including Sweden, Ukraine, Georgia, Australia and New Zealand, she said.</p> <p>The British government had not yet decided what military role it would have in Afghanistan beyond 2014, Leslie made clear. There is a widespread assumption that British and US special forces will remain in the country as well as trainers and advisers.</p> <p>Capewell said preparations had already begun to remove a huge amount of military equipment from Afghanistan, either through the north or through Pakistan, in what he called the \"biggest redeployment operation in a generation\". As many as 500 extra troops may be deployed to help with the extraction operation, he added.</p>",
  "<p>The Football Association has vowed to stand by two unnamed England Under-21 players and a member of the coaching staff who were on Tuesday charged by Serbian police over the violent scenes that marred the end of this month's Euro 2013 qualifier in Krusevac at which Danny Rose was racially abused.</p> <p>The governing body is in contact with the British government for advice regarding how best to proceed. A total of 12 people have been charged \u2013 the remainder are Serbian \u2013 and, if Serbia's public prosecutors decide the cases are a court matter, there is a possibility of custodial sentences if those accused are convicted.</p> <p>The Serbian Interior Ministry said: \"Charges have been pressed against five Serbia players and an assistant coach, two England players and an assistant coach as well as three fans. According to the instructions of the public prosecutor's office in Krusevac, they have been charged with violent conduct at a public sports event on 16 October at the Mladost Stadium. The three fans have been charged with the use of fireworks.\"</p> <p>Yet the FA stated it had not been made aware of the charges and pledged full support to players and staff.</p> <p>A statement said: \"Further to the Serbian police announcement regarding charging English Under-21 players and staff, the Football Association can confirm it has not received any formal notification of any charges filed by the Serbian authorities. We have not been made aware of any of the names of individuals connected with these charges and we therefore await further details and formal communication on these matters.</p> <p>\"Meanwhile we are in contact with the British government for advice, as well as speaking with our colleagues at Uefa. The FA reiterates its position of full support for all players and staff caught up in the appalling scenes in Serbia two weeks ago. We want to reassure those concerned that we are committed to doing everything necessary to protect them whilst also offering support to individuals and their families.\"</p> <p>The brawl at the end of the game appeared instigated by Serbian players and staff, with their English counterparts trying to avoid being hurt while leaving the field. The Serbian players Nikola Ninkovic and Ognjen Mudrinski have been suspended by the country's FA for a year, while the coaches Srdjan Maksimovic and Andreja Milutinovic were given two-year bans. During the match what sounded like monkey chants could be heard from the home support, with Rose the apparent target of racial abuse.</p> <p>The left-back's frustrations at his treatment culminated with him being sent off at the close of England's 2-0 win that sealed qualification for Euro 2013, after he kicked a ball. Yet Rose was accused of triggering the incidents following the final whistle with inappropriate gestures toward the crowd. A day after the match the Serbia FA posted on their official YouTube channel an edited six-minute clip, entitled: \"Danny Rose is lying to whom?\" This contained footage of Rose in action during the game, with no evidence of racist abuse aimed at him.</p> <p>Below the clip, a caption read: \"Danny Rose said: 'Every time I touched the ball, they were doing the monkey chanting again.' As you can see in this video, there was no unsportsmanlike cheering and insulting opposing players on racial grounds.\"</p> <p>Yet the video did not progress beyond 76 minutes of the match and failed to include the post-game fracas, while other separate footage did implicate the crowd, and several witnesses gave accounts of the abuse which the England players insisted had taken place from the warm-up onwards.</p> <p>Last week the Uefa president, Michel Platini, claimed Serbia could face tough sanctions if found guilty of racism. \"We will get the report from the delegates and the report from the officials - wWe have television footage and the disciplinary committee will deal with it,\" he said.</p> <p>Following the episode, Alex Horne, the FA general secretary, said: \"No football team should be asked to play in any environment where racial abuse, violence and threatening behaviour is prevalent.\"</p> <p>Yet in the days after the game Uefa charged both countries for the \"improper conduct\" of their players, and while the Serbia FA issued an apology for the on-field trouble it denied any racism towards the England team. Uefa is scheduled to deal with its cases on 22 November.</p>",
  "<p>My favourite episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show of all time was one in which she, Saint Oprah, interviewed siblings of celebrities. On this particular show \u2013 which aired almost two decades now, so forgive me if the specifics are a little fuzzy \u2013 the audience met people with names like \"Don Swayze\", whose faces were almost familiar, but not quite. They looked like the daytime TV biopic drama versions of their siblings and all of them were so pitiably desperate to be famous in their own right that they deluded themselves that riding on the coat-tails of their siblings was the path to such glory. Those of us who saw and were similarly impacted by this episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show (RIP) were thus well prepared for the emergence of that rebuttal to Darwinism in human form, the reality TV contestant. Thanks to these folk, by the time Entourage debuted I knew that Drama, the celebrity's pathetic brother on that show (who was, of course, played by Kevin Dillon, another celebrity's brother), was a ridiculous understatement.</p> <p>This preamble, as well as allowing me to indulge in some sentimentality for The Oprah Winfrey Show, brings me to Philippa Middleton, known to the world as Pippa, the 29-year-old sister of someone who married into the royal family.</p> <p>Maybe it's because, until last month, I'd been living in the US for the past few years that despite her ubiquity in the British press I've never had much of an opinion about Pippa Middleton (or maybe it's because, being a hitherto silent Sloane, there's not much of an opinion to be had). But having spent the past weekend nose-deep in her debut tome, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/28/celebrate-pippa-middleton\" title=\"\">Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Families and Friends</a>, I now have plenty of opinions about Ms Middleton. To anyone fretting that dear beloved Penguin will lose its uniquely cerebral identity when it is swallowed by corporate Random House, allow me to recommend Celebrate by Pippa Middleton, which is published by Michael Joseph, which is part of the Penguin Group.</p> <p>Now, I would like to say from the start that I'm sure Pippa is a perfectly sweet young woman. She is also, judging from the photos inside, particularly skilled at wearing cosy knitwear which, while not necessarily what one can call a skill, is still, in some circles \u2013 Pippa's circles \u2013 seen as a valued asset. \"This is my first chance to [paint a picture of myself], and I have enjoyed every minute of it,\" Pippa writes in the introduction. I suspect that on many levels Celebrate really is a mirror reflection of the woman herself: expensively packaged, sleekly styled, stuffed with bland inanities and dizzy with images of Pippa and interchangeable posh young men in fleeces. If you ever wondered what being Pippa would be like, wonder no more.</p> <p>On the subject of \"global recognition\", Pippa admits that \"it has its upside and downside ... I am by nature an optimist, so I tend to concentrate on the advantages. One of the most attractive has been the chance to publish Celebrate.\"</p> <p>Only one of the most attractive, mind. While snark does play havoc with one's digestion, it is impossible to suppress the thought that the most attractive advantage was to be paid a \u00a3400,000 advance to knock out a book that has the following insider tips inside:</p> <p>\"For Halloween, a pointy hat, fake hair and a broom [make] a witch's outfit.\"</p> <p>\"When hosting a party, move any clutter from the space where you're entertaining.\"</p> <p>\"Nearly any breakfast becomes special when it's brought to you in bed.\"</p> <p>\"Tea bags should go in the teapot, rather than individually in mugs.\"</p> <p>A guide on how to have an Easter egg hunt (\"An adult hides a selection of eggs. They should be low down within easy reach of children.\")</p> <p>One cannot blame Pippa for being offered close to half a million pounds to provide guidance about how to make a cup of tea. For that, blame Penguin for being so keen to take advantage of Pippa's vague sheen of fame that it rushed this bland young woman into publishing such a high-profile book. One can, though, question whether she is truly in the right career if, after years of hacking it out at the coalface of her parents' party-planning company, Party Pieces, the most she can offer is tea-making tips.</p> <p>Being a celebrity's sibling needn't involve the kind of public humiliation that the guests on Oprah's show were prone to. Nor does being connected to royalty, or even quasi royalty, mean a life sentence of mediocrity. Yet Pippa is neither saucy enough to be as fun as Princess Margaret, nor fabulous enough to be as intriguing as Lee Radziwill, Jackie Onassis's sister.</p> <p>All she needs is to find something she is genuinely good at that won't look as if she is bilking her connections. So here, out of the goodness of my heart, is a selection of job ideas for Pippa:</p> <p><strong>a)</strong> <strong>Be a designer's muse</strong></p> <p>I worked on this newspaper's fashion desk for almost a decade and I still don't know what a designer's muse does. But whatever it is, I feel certain Pippa could do it with aplomb.</p> <p><strong>b) Be a consultant</strong></p> <p>Again, no idea what this is. But it sounds bland and boring and is the kind of thing posh people tend to do.</p> <p><strong>c) Be a Boden model</strong></p> <p>I've seen the proof: she can do this.</p> <p><strong>d) Work with children in the developing world</strong></p> <p>Whatever.</p>",
  "<p>Essex police were criticised on Tuesday for failings before the murder of a woman by her violent ex-partner. On the day of Jeanette Goodwin's murder police failed to make sufficient links with previous domestic violence incidents and did not fully appreciate how much danger she was in, a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found.</p> <p>Goodwin, a 47-year-old mother of three from Southend, made seven reports to police of harassment and domestic violence from her ex-partner, Martin Bunch, between January 2011 and the day of her murder on 24 July last year.</p> <p>Police were praised by the IPCC for their support for Goodwin before her murder \u2013 they installed a panic alarm in her home and arrested Bunch several times for a variety of offences including battery and harassment. Magistrates released him on bail despite police pleas to have him remanded in custody, the report said.</p> <p>The serious failings identified by the IPCC were on the day she died. Background and intelligence checks were not conducted when Goodwin first called 999 at 2.40pm, saying that Bunch had been at her fence and had been harassing her. She stated five times that she was scared.</p> <p>The next contact was at 7.40pm, when Goodwin activated the panic alarm. When police arrived at her home they found her dying from multiple stab wounds. A communications supervisor in the Force Information Room said that while he didn't feel he could have done much more as he had not been notified about all the background information they had \"failed this woman terribly, we should have had someone there much, much, much sooner\", the report said.</p> <p>IPCC commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: \"The system in place then was badly flawed, not utilising intelligence checks to inform decision making when prioritising incidents.\"</p> <p>She added: \"There was a failure to recognise, in the light of the known history of this case, that Mr Bunch's presence close to her home, in breach of his bail conditions, required immediate and urgent action to try to arrest him.\"</p> <p>Other domestic violence deaths in Essex have prompted concerns about a failure to link together separate incidents, including that of Mary Russell, 81, in 2010. She died of head injuries after her husband allegedly hit her. A report by Southend Safeguarding Vulnerable Adults Board last year found police treated Russell's seven claims of domestic violence as standalone incidents rather than as related and the CPS decided there was not enough evidence to bring a criminal prosecution.</p> <p>In another case, Christine Chambers and her daughter, Shania, were murdered in June 2011 by David Oakes. In August 2012 an IPCC report found that Essex police had failed to recognise any pattern or connection between events and identified a failure to share information between agencies.</p> <p>Between June and September this year there have been four more domestic homicides in Essex. The force has confirmed that at least three of the victims had contact with it before their deaths.</p> <p>Essex police have, however, made significant improvements to domestic violence policy, including an amendment to delineate responsibilities in the force control room. A domestic abuse intelligence team is now based there to ensure that appropriate checks are completed and accurately recorded on the log immediately following the report.</p> <p>Cerfontyne said: \"The police have a tendency not to join the dots on domestic violence, but rather to deal with repeated incidents in isolation. They struggle to understand the coercive and controlling environment in which domestic violence takes place and the impact this may have on a woman trying to escape it, which is when they often face the greatest risk.\"</p> <p>Deputy Chief Constable Derek Benson, of Essex police, has accepted the findings of the IPCC report into Goodwin's murder. \"The initial call should have been treated more seriously, and a unit dispatched,\" he said. \"Too much emphasis was placed on Mrs Goodwin saying she was going out and would not be in until 4.30pm, rather than her stating she was scared of Bunch. There is however no way of knowing if our actions at this time had been different whether Mrs Goodwin would still have been murdered,\" he said.Goodwin's family issued a statement welcoming the findings:</p> <p>\"We are pleased that the IPCC report has highlighted areas of procedures that could have been better on the day of Jeanette's death.</p> <p>\"Although this will not bring back our dearest Jeanette, we are satisfied that these procedures have been improved, ensuring that victims of domestic violence can now be treated as they should, as a priority.\"</p> <p>A system of multi-agency domestic homicide reviews was launched by the government in April 2011 and these reviews are under way into the cases of Chambers and Goodwin. The idea is to learn from previous cases, help spot potential victims earlier and prevent violence from escalating in other cases.</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"More than 130 domestic homicide reviews are underway with a number nearing completion. By making domestic homicide reviews mandatory important lessons are being learned that we hope will prevent future tragedies and tackle domestic violence.\"</p>",

Horizon plans new reactors at Wylfa on Anglesey, north Wales, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>The Japanese company's move means EDF, which last week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/future-nuclear-power-uk-edf?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">threatened to hold the government to ransom</a> for higher subsidies for its nuclear plans, will face competition in constructing new reactors. David Cameron said: \"This is a decades-long, multibillion-pound vote of confidence that will contribute vital new infrastructure to power our economy. It will support up to 12,000 jobs during construction and thousands more permanent highly skilled roles once the new power plants are operational, as well as stimulating exciting new industrial investments in the UK's nuclear supply chain.\"</p> <p>At the same time, a pot of \u00a31bn in government funding will be made available to up to three projects that promise to be the first major demonstration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in the UK.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/30/carbon-capture-competition-shortlist\" title=\"\">four shortlisted projects</a> \u2013 chosen from eight submissions \u2013 are made up of two in Scotland (one at Grangemouth and another at Peterhead), along with one in Teesside and a project connected to the UK's biggest coal-fired power station, Drax in Yorkshire.</p> <p>Edward Davey, secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: \"[This] is an important step towards an exciting new industry, one that could help us reduce our carbon emissions and create thousands of jobs.\"</p> <p>But critics complained that the government had merely put off its decision on CCS, as the precise details of the funding will not be announced until next year.</p> <p>Tom Greatrex the shadow energy minister, said: \"Yet again Ed Davey has kicked a decision about support for CCS into the long grass, creating more uncertainty for the industry. We are now at risk of losing our competitive advantage in developing low-carbon technologies, engineering expertise and valuable skills that we could export around the globe.\" owing to the difficulty of putting together a business plan that would satisfy investors.</p> <p>The scale of the energy challenge facing the UK is daunting. John Loughhead, executive director of the UK Energy Research Council, said it was the equivalent of having to run an operation the size of the Olympics every two years for the next two and a half decades. He said every CCS plant would cost about \u00a31bn for the carbon capture technology alone, in addition to the money needed to build the power plant, and about $70 per tonne for dealing with the resulting carbon dioxide on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>Stuart Haszeldine, an expert on CCS at University of Edinburgh, said the announcement had injected momentum into the important task of developing technology that will be needed to meet the UK's carbon targets. \"It is unexpectedly good news. We now have four plausible designs. It's about [the Department of Energy and Climate Change] knocking heads together to see if the companies can improve the commercial terms of the deals by co-operating.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/Wildlife-in-Norfolk/Reserves/Lower-Wood,-Ashwellthorpe.aspx\" title=\"\">Ashwellthorpe</a> lower wood is still, wet and silent. Gold and ginger leaves float from the branches above. Pale fungi rise through decomposing leaves below. The only sound is the astonishing cackle of a green woodpecker. Everything is dying back, peacefully, just as it has for hundreds of autumns.</p> <p>In July, when I last walked in Ashwellthorpe, a rare fragment of thousand-year-old Norfolk forest, the ash trees that gave the wood its name, kept locals in timber for centuries and supplied broom handles to a nearby factory for generations were green and healthy. Now they carry a malignant look: the leaves are not the yellow and&#xa0;brown of an ordinary October but&#xa0;a&#xa0;sickly black. Their graceful slim trunks, the colour of an elephant's skin, are mottled with sinister stains.</p> <p>Last Friday, DNA tests confirmed that its ash trees were the among the first in an ancient woodland to succumb to <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/chalara\" title=\"\"><em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, or ash dieback, a virulent fungal disease that has swept across Europe and entered Britain</a>, most probably via imported saplings, earlier this year. On Monday, the government slapped an import ban on ash trees and pledged to do all it could to contain this \"devastating\" disease. Critics say this action is far too little, too late. The answers to the obvious questions \u2013 What has caused its spread? Can anything stop it? \u2013 remain frighteningly uncertain. There are growing fears the disease will kill millions of ashes, which makes up around a third of our woods and hedges. This fungus is likely to transform our countryside more dramatically than <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/HCOU-4U4JCL\" title=\"\">Dutch elm disease</a>, another fatal killer accidentally spread around the world by the timber trade, which has destroyed more than 25 million trees in Britain since the late 1960s.</p> <p>\"They shiver in the wind and throw out boughs with a calculated aim, which is to be beautiful,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/oct/21/ronald-blythe-yeomans-house-bottengoms\" title=\"\">Ronald Blythe</a> of a pair of young ashes near his home in Essex. Gerard Manley Hopkins admired the \"contradictory supple curvings\" of an ash's boughs. \"The ash grove how graceful / how plainly 'tis speaking\" goes the Welsh folk song the Ash Grove. Poets and writers have long hailed the aesthetic qualities of the ash, whose Latin name, <em>Fraxinus excelsior</em>, celebrates its heavenly height, but it is even more admired for its utilitarian qualities. Fast-growing, strong and flexible, ash is the prince of all timbers. Every handle of every tool was once made from ash (until hickory was imported from the US), and ash was widely used in gates and cartwheels. These days, the wood's attractive grain and light hue makes fashionable furniture. Foresters love ash because it quickly grows tall and true. And as anyone with a wood-burning stove knows, ash is the king of logs: <a href=\"http://www.stovesonline.co.uk/wood_for_burning.html\" title=\"\">\"Ash-wood wet and ash-wood dry / a King may warm his slippers by.\"</a></p> <p>Brendan Joyce, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Norfolk Wildlife Trust</a>, does not just admire ash because its wood made his beloved Fender Stratocaster guitar. Ash is a particularly convivial tree. Because it does not cast heavy shade, it allows plenty of other plants to grow alongside it. \"Ash woods tend to be rich and diverse places unlike beech woods, which tend to be rather monotonous,\" says woodland ecologist George Peterken. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil was an enormous ash tree that harboured all the life in the universe. Beneath the ashes of Ashwellthorpe are carpets of bluebells and early purple orchids in spring and white admiral butterflies in July. Ash's key-like seeds feed woodmice and its bark is particularly conducive to mosses and lichens. Some 80 common insects and 60 of the rarest beetles and flies have an association with ash trees, according to Chris Panter at the University of East Anglia.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HqBOT5iBucM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HqBOT5iBucM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><em>Chalara fraxinea</em> first emerged in Poland in 1992. A fungus attacks ash leaves, moving inside young shoots into the heart of the tree, effectively strangling it by preventing it from taking both nutrients from the earth and sugars from photosynthesis. Infected leaves fall in October and the fungus spores spread from these the following July. These spores can be blown in the air: researchers in Norway, where the human movement of ash was quickly banned, discovered the disease travelled 30km each year by itself. In Denmark, 90% of ash trees are now showing symptoms of the disease and will eventually die. In 2010, the disease was confirmed in the Netherlands and Belgium. In February this year, it was discovered in young trees imported from Holland to a nursery in Buckinghamshire. Outbreaks have since been identified in newly planted trees at more than 30 locations, including Scotland, Yorkshire, Leicestershire and Cambridgeshire, and in a Woodland Trust wood in Suffolk.</p> <p>The outbreak at Ashwellthorpe, however, is a game-changer. The Norfolk Wildlife Trust reserve has had no new trees imported from anywhere into it. The disease was spotted five weeks ago by Steve Collin of the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. When he reported it, Forestry Commission officials were not overly concerned at first, according to Collin, because it had only been found in new plantations. An inspection and DNA tests, however, showed the disease had somehow found its way into this ancient woodland. Dozens of other possible outbreaks in East Anglia and Kent are now being investigated.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2jiWp07e5Q8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2jiWp07e5Q8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The apparently sluggish response to the disease by the government is another stick with which to beat the hapless Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair (Defra) after the furore over the forests sell-off and badger cull. \"If they wanted to stop the disease coming in they should have reacted before this year rather than sitting around waiting for it to come in,\" says Peterken. Why was an import ban not slapped on ash immediately the disease was discovered in February? Or why not years ago, with the disease marching across Europe? The <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/page.php?pageid=1000\" title=\"\">Horticultural Trades Association</a> (HTA) warned Defra of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> three years ago and asked it to ban imported ash trees. According to Tim Briercliffe of the HTA, fatalistic-sounding civil servants told him that as the disease was already endemic on the continent it was likely to come to the UK.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398680377\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/30/1351618874145/An-ash-tree-showing-signs-010.jpg\" alt=\"An ash tree showing signs of ash dieback\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The leaves of this ash tree show signs of ash dieback. Photograph: The Food and Environment Research Agency</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Food and Environment Research Agency</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Environment minister David Heath has denied that the HTA warned Defra about the disease in 2009. At that time, the Forestry Commission believed it could not ban ash imports under EU law because the organism that causes ash dieback was erroneously believed to be already present in Britain.</p> <p>But calls for decisive action also worry conservationists. When the new environment secretary Owen Paterson last week spoke of \"bearing down\" on wildlife to tackle bovine TB, a chill ran through Joyce. He fears the criticisms levelled at Paterson could lead to a \"gung-ho\" desperation to be seen to be doing something \u2013 and the government could order the destruction of every ash tree in infected areas. In a wood such as Ashwellthorpe, this would remove 40% of the wood's trees. This messy job could irreparably damage the forest floor. Burning dead trees (100,000 infected nursery saplings have been burned) would remove rotting timber that provides habitat for beetles and other invertebrates. It would also be frighteningly expensive. Even if the government helped pay for ash extermination, Norfolk Wildlife Trust would then lose other grants and funding because it would be destroying trees.</p> <p>Removing all ash trees in infected sites would also wipe out individual trees that are resistant to it. \"Yes, we need action but not knee-jerk,\" says Joyce. \"We don't want to advocate more dithering, but scientists need to be allowed to study how to control it. Chopping down so many ash trees in a woodland like this would not only be futile in preventing the spread but also highly disruptive and unnecessary.\"</p> <p>The outbreaks in ancient woodlands may provide succour for the beleaguered Defra. Is it possible the spores were not actually brought into Britain by careless trade but were borne by wind across the North Sea? \"It's possible, but the chance of that is absolutely minuscule,\" says <a href=\"http://www.abdn.ac.uk/biologicalsci/staff/details/s.woodward#research_interests\" title=\"\">Dr Stephen Woodward</a> of the University of Aberdeen, who has been studying forest pathology for 30 years. \"Some people at the top in Defra are trying to claim that's the way it got here \u2013 it's very, very unlikely.\"</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://icp-forests.net/profile/IbenMargreteThomsen\" title=\"\">Iben Margrete Thomsen</a>, a forest pathologist from the University of Copenhagen, the disease would have eventually reached Britain naturally, probably across the English Channel from Belgium and northern France. But scientists agree the most likely cause of the current outbreak is the extraordinary international trade in trees.</p> <p>Peterken reacts with \"incredulity that people will import ash to plant rather than use local stock\". Ash is \"like a weed. I'm constantly rooting it out of my borders and gutters,\" he says. \"The idea of people going off to Holland or Hungary and buying the things and planting them seems plain crazy.\"</p> <p>The reality is even crazier. The Woodland Trust has been busy with its largest ever tree-planting campaign to create the 460-acre Jubilee Forest in Leicestershire. Like other foresters, the charity asks nurseries for ash from native seeds. Its suppliers comply but some send seeds to the Netherlands to be grown before saplings are returned for planting. Austin Brady, the trust's head of conservation, admits that the charity may have unknowingly bought trees from nurseries that grew British seeds abroad. \"There is a potential we may have been unsighted on that,\" he says. \"We need to get together with other key players and understand the processes in play. We've got a bit of homework to do.\" He hopes the charity's involvement in the round-table summit on tree trade announced by Defra will help it \"get a better understanding of the risks associated with this [importation of saplings from British seed grown overseas],\" he says.</p> <p>What do ecologists think of a tree-planting charity with a commitment to \"supporting, nurturing and encouraging native woodland and making them more robust in the fact of climate change and disease\" in the words of Brady that unknowingly buys saplings grown abroad? \"It's rather unfortunate,\" says Peterken.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398680378\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/30/1351619031180/Young-ash-tree-showing-sy-010.jpg\" alt=\"Young ash tree showing symptoms of Chalara fraxinea infection.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young ash tree showing symptoms of <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> infection. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrew Bronwin, a private-sector forest manager who has planted hundreds of thousands of ash trees for landowners in recent years, likens the exposure of these \"dysfunctional\" aspects of the forestry supply chain to the scandal over foot-and-mouth disease at the turn of the century, when people had no idea of the extent to which farm animals were being transported around the country. \"When you buy something, if it says it's UK provenance you have no idea where it comes from,\" says Bronwin of purchasing young trees. \"We never asked the question [about whether a 'British' tree was actually grown abroad] and we didn't know that was a question that needed to be asked.\" As Bronwin and forest scientists point out, the struggling British nursery industry does not grow enough saplings to meet demand, unlike the Dutch, the great gardeners of Europe, who have invested in infrastructure to grow trees more cheaply than elsewhere.</p> <p>The Woodland Trust is calling for a wider debate about the huge quantities of plants that are traded around the world, all carrying soil and unknown diseases. One study has found that 1.5 billion individual plants were imported into the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy in a year. Tree pathologists such as Woodward want to see Britain introduce a tougher customs regime, like New Zealand, which better weeds out plants known to carry risks of disease. \"I'm not against trade per se, but I'm against things coming in that lead to the collapse of the environment,\" says Woodward. \"It's an immense tangled web of commerce and money that could take years to unravel.\"</p> <p>Can anything be done to stop <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>? Thomsen has bleak news. Movement restrictions of traded trees might slow the disease but destroying all ash trees in infected areas \"is just a waste of money\", she says. \"There is no way you can deal with a fungus that can move by 30km just by spores. You just have to wait. I'm afraid you've had it.\"</p> <p>Like many people, Thomsen did not realise how much of the greenery on the countryside was ash until it began to die in Denmark. \"You can't imagine how awful it looks on these trees. When I travel to Britain, it's so wonderful to see how ash trees are meant to look. It's very sad,\" she says.</p> <p>Ecologists know that the natural world is resilient. Between 1% and 2% of ash trees in Denmark are showing signs of immunity from the disease. Resistant trees can be grown from such stock. Peterken is optimistic that ash will recover more quickly than elm. There are now more individual wych elms around Peterken's home in the Wye Valley than there were before Dutch elm disease. The disease was \"a huge setback as a prominent feature in the landscape and in biomass terms in the woods but elm is still there and it's adapted. My guess is that something like that would happen to ash, only more quickly.\"</p> <p>Change is also a constant in the natural world. As long as the bulldozers are not sent into Ashwellthorpe in a futile gesture against the disease, its beauty will endure even though its doomed ashes won't. \"I come from a school of thought that feels that wildlife is part of the natural world and has a right to exist, but we seem to live in a world where unless we can put a value on it, we think it is not worth anything to us,\" says Joyce in Ashwellthorpe. \"But, actually, places like this are very&#xa0;valuable to people. I come here frequently on my own and every time, whether it's in the spring, summer, autumn or winter, it's always got something special about it and I always&#xa0;go away from here feeling so much better in myself. How can you put a value on that? It's priceless.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was modified on 1 November 2012. The original version incorrectly described a Woodland Trust wood in Suffolk as new. This has been amended. Another sentence was amended to clarify that it is nurseries sending ash seeds to the Netherlands not the Woodland Trust.</p>",
  "<p>BP has rewarded \"very patient\" shareholders and pension funds buffeted by the group's travails in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster with a double-digit increase in its dividend.</p> <p>A week after announcing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/22/bp-rosneft-deal-27-billion-dollars\" title=\"\">$27bn (\u00a317bn) sale of its 50% stake in Russian business TNK-BP</a> to the Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, the British oil group said it would increase its third-quarter dividend to 9\u00a2 a share \u2013 a rise of 12.5% \u2013 in a move that goes some way to reasserting BP's status in pension fund portfolios. At its height, the BP investor payout accounted for \u00a31 in every \u00a36 of FTSE 100 dividend payments. But even at 9\u00a2 it remains below its pre-Deepwater level of 14\u00a2 in 2010, after which it was suspended for three successive quarters until its reinstatement in early 2011 at half its previous level. BP shares closed 4.2% higher at 442.85p. The stock remains about 30% below the 658p level that it was trading at shortly before the world's worst offshore spill, which saw 4.9m barrels of oil gush into the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>BP's chief executive, Bob Dudley, said the dividend move was a reaction to the Rosneft deal, the development of new oil and gas prospects, and a post-Deepwater disposal programme that has nearly reached its $38bn target.</p> <p>\"We recognise that we have had some very patient shareholders. It is a combination of divestments, projects coming on stream and some clarity in Russia, that gave the board the confidence to reward our shareholders this quarter,\" he said. At 14\u00a2 a quarter the BP dividend contributed around $10bn a year to pension funds, with the new 9\u00a2 representing an annualised payment of about $6.8bn.</p> <p>The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents 1,300 schemes with assets totalling \u00a3900bn, said it welcomed the move. \"BP is a big company and a key holding for investors, so this rise in their dividend will be welcomed by many pension funds. It is also an encouraging indicator of the long-term health of the company,\" said David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the NAPF.</p> <p>BP's third-quarter underlying replacement profit of $5.2bn \u2013 a figure that strips out fluctuations in oil prices \u2013 beat forecasts by more than $1bn, but represented a decline of 5% on the same period last year due to a number of divestments made by BP over the past 12 months.</p> <p>Dudley added that BP was undaunted by a succession of bruising encounters with Russian geopolitics, which include Dudley's experience as boss of TNK-BP in 2008, when he was forced to quit after an \"orchestrated campaign of harassment\". Dudley said: \"We have always had a good relationship with Rosneft&#xa0;\u2026 there is a very clear commitment to create and build a modern and efficient, world-class company.\" BP will emerge from the TNK-BP deal with an 18.5% stake in Rosneft. Acknowledging BP's fractious relationship with TNK-BP's co-owners, a group of oligarchs called AAR, he added: \"The relationship seems to have run its course and BP did not want to leave Russia.\"</p> <p>BP said its results were boosted by a strong performance in its downstream business, driven by improved profitability at its refining units, while its upstream business \u2013 oil and gas production \u2013 produced a similar performance to the previous quarter. BP's US refineries have struggled for profitability in recent years but problems at rival refiners, including Exxon's Beaumont facility, helped boost profits over the past three months. In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">Gulf of Mexico spill</a>, which has cost BP $38.1bn so far, the group has outlined a 10-point strategy that includes developing more profitable oil and gas fields. With that target in mind, the majority of BP's significant new projects that are due to come into production by 2014 are in four areas: the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, Azerbaijan and the North Sea. \"All of these projects are on track,\" said BP.</p> <p>As part of its post-spill strategy to slim down the group and raised compensation funds, BP has divested $35bn worth of businesses including $11bn in disposals since the second quarter, led by its Texas City and Carson refineries in the US. BP said it will make a \"final\" payment of $860m into a $20bn Gulf of Mexico compensation fund. Excluding that $20bn fund, the group has paid out $15bn in compensation and clean-up costs so far. However, it is still negotiating a settlement with the US department of justice over criminal and civil offences. BP said: \"Whilst [BP] is ready to settle on reasonable terms, a number of unresolved issues remain and there is significant uncertainty as to whether an agreement will ultimately be reached.\" According to reports, the DoJ could be seeking a settlement of at least $18bn, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/30/bp-oil-spill-settlement-talks-stall\" title=\"\">while BP is holding out for $15bn</a>.</p>",

Both banks have large offices in London. Deutsche Bank employs more than 8,500 staff in the UK, with 7,000 of those in the capital.</p> <p>In the third quarter, net revenues rose 18% to \u20ac8.7bn (\u00a37bn), mostly reflecting improved market conditions and increased market activity. Investment banking revenues surged 65% to \u20ac4.3bn but were offset by higher costs for streamlining the business and from credit write-offs. Net income slipped nearly 3% to \u20ac755m, but still beat expectations.</p> <p>The bank booked \u20ac276m in restructuring expenses in connection with its cuts programme and \u20ac289m for litigation, although it did not give details.

  "<p>Not long ago, I was shown around an award-winning housing estate in east London, which was the proud recipient of a Secured by Design (SBD) award. The housing on the gated estate had small windows, reinforced steel doors and grey, aluminium, military-style roofs. The overall effect was oppressive.</p> <p>High levels of security have come to characterise our public buildings. This is because security has become a prerequisite of planning permission as a result of SBD, which is a design policy that has the blessing of the police. Administered by the Association of Chief Police Officers, SBD is funded by the 480 security companies that sell the goods needed to meet the required standards. The unintended effects that&#xa0;this approach has had on fear and trust in communities are the subject of&#xa0;my forthcoming report, Fortress Britain, from the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/\" title=\"\">New Economics Foundation</a> thinktank.</p> <p>SBD has its roots in the idea of \"defensible space\", created by the American architect and town planner Oscar Newman in the early 1970s, as a result of research he carried out in three deprived New York housing projects. His main finding was that \"territoriality\" created space that could defend itself. By marking out boundaries clearly, residents would feel a sense of ownership over communal spaces and would discourage strangers and opportunistic criminals from entering.</p> <p>Newman's considerable influence led to the adoption of Crime Prevention through Environmental Design in the US, the design policy that was imported as SBD into Britain, where it began life as a regional crime reduction initiative in the late 1980s.</p> <p>Both in the US and in Britain the idea of defensible space was very popular because it provided a simple solution: rather than engaging with complex social relations as the underlying causes of crime, SBD promoted the idea that environmental design was the biggest influence on behaviour.</p> <p>Today, SBD is based on a combination of defensible space ideas and the purchase of security products, strongly backed by the insurance industry, which provides lower premiums for properties with SBD.</p> <p>Many of the recommendations, such as the need to provide good locks on windows and doors, are sensible. But the blanket application of SBD standards tends to create a threatening environment, particularly in poorer areas.</p> <p>For example, in schools and public buildings the first step of SBD is a crime risk assessment, which is about the local area. While high fences, walls or other barriers are a prerequisite for any school, the crime risk assessment will suggest whether additional security measures are necessary. This means that in higher crime areas security is much greater, creating places that have a militarised feel to them. Because higher crime areas tend to be poor, deprived neighbourhoods have become characterised by public buildings, such as council offices, that come with fortress-like levels of security.</p> <p><strong>Lack of evidence</strong></p> <p>One of the main reasons for this report was the lack of evidence that installing gates and CCTV created safe, cohesive and trusting communities. Of the few existing studies, <a href=\"http://www.1in12.com/publications/cctv/ditton.htm\" title=\"\">an investigation into CCTV by the then Scottish Office</a> found that, while people often believed CCTV would make them feel safer, the opposite turned out to be the case.</p> <p>My report, which includes a field study carried out on a Peabody Trust housing estate in central London, hopes to add to this slim body of research. Interviews and focus groups were carried out with residents and practitioners working in neighbourhood management, estate services and youth services on Peabody Avenue, an&#xa0;estate where 55 new homes have recently been completed.</p> <p>What we found independently was that, although increased security, and in particular CCTV, was often very popular with residents, it did not necessarily lead to feelings of increased safety, with residents reporting that the presence of CCTV could instead increase anxiety.</p> <p>Security measures including gates and internal doors elicited a similar response, with residents illustrating that \"defensible space\" can increase fear of strangers. \"Because of the doors, if you see someone you don't know, there is an element of 'Who is this?'\" one resident commented. A practitioner added: \"The more you secure a block or an estate, the more it gives a message that something is wrong with that estate.\"</p> <p>Incidents of actual crime were barely mentioned. By far the biggest problem was young people hanging around late into the night in the courtyard of the estate, which is surrounded by housing. On a number of occasions the play area had been vandalised. Because the young people in question were either residents or friends of residents, barring access to the estate through the use of gates did not seem sensible. The study suggested that high security was offered as a technical response to a complex social problem, which required a different kind of solution. It was clear that residents felt that \"knowing people\", whether it be caretakers, youth workers or each other, was the key to creating trust.</p> <p>\"The physical security measures \u2013 such as gating, intercom systems, CCTV \u2013 have increased, and the eyes on the ground have been removed. There's more CCTV, less manpower,\" said one practitioner.</p> <p>Focus groups of residents and practitioners were given a fantasy budget to create a safe and trusting community. Both chose security features, but they decided to allocate the largest portion of the budget to \"people on the ground\", including caretakers. This was a small study but clear conclusions emerged about the links between fear and trust, and the removal of caretakers, who were seen to provide \"social glue\" in communities. Despite caretakers appearing to be much more effective in building community trust than the installation of CCTV, gating and door entry systems, they are not acknowledged by SBD, which is a&#xa0;blunt instrument, incapable of adapting to complex unintended consequences. Despite the all-pervasive influence of this&#xa0;policy, there is a lack of evidence to support it.</p> <p>Arguably, the problems at Peabody Avenue, which can also be found in countless estates around the country, could best be tackled by talented youth and community workers who command the respect of young people.</p> <p><strong>\u2022</strong> Fortress Britain: high security, insecurity and the challenge of preventing harm, by Anna Minton and Jody Aked.

They released their debut single, The John Wayne, in July on the <a href=\"http://www.youngandlostclub.com\" title=\"\">Young and Lost Club</a> label, but are reissuing it this month now that they have a deal with Island in the UK and <a href=\"http://glassnotemusic.com/page/about-us\" title=\"\">Glassnote</a>, the US home of Mumford &amp; Sons and Two Door Cinema Club. They could be really successful, but success of what kind we're not sure. Listening to their debut album Absolute Zero \u2013 produced (at his request, apparently) by Markus Dravs, who has worked with Bj\u00f6rk, Arcade Fire and, most recently, with Mumford &amp; Sons on their latest album Babel \u2013 we can't tell if they're being primed as a mainstream UK version of the Dixie Chicks or as an alt-country thing: there are tracks on Absolute Zero that have more in common with Band of Horses, that are more Brooklyn than Nashville or Texas.</p> <p>The boy-girl harmonies work, and the rousing melodies are in constant supply. Harper Lee, the opening track on the album, due next year, posits the band, still only teenagers, as a latterday Mamas and the Papas (or a more accomplished <a href=\"http://heavenlyrecordings.com/artists/the-magic-numbers/\" title=\"\">Magic Numbers</a>), with a lyric (\"Like a crash I wait for the impact\") that is probably about love but could easily apply to their imminent breakthrough. Angel Owl begins unimpressively before erupting, a cloudburst of harmonies enveloping Stevie Appleby's voice. On his own, on Consequences, Appleby can sound as much like Neil Young as he does <a href=\"http://www.monkeyheaven.com/lookalike_s_neil.jpg\" title=\"\">Neil</a> from the Young Ones, like a dippy cipher. But full marks to Dravs for bolstering the singer and turning it into a lush drama. River Song is a showcase for Faye O'Rourke and suddenly the band come over all Florence, only with an a cappella flourish for the coda before things get too bombastic.</p> <p>They're not afraid to stretch out and mess with the formula. Red and Blue is strikingly different: with its Auto-Tuned male voice intoning mournfully over a churchy organ motif, it's actually closer to the Weeknd than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCElUItrLZc\" title=\"\">Neil's Out on the Weekend</a>. Some of the tracks offer a more reined-in version of that Mercury Rev/Band of Horses brand of cosmic country. Kitchen Floor makes a virtue of its traditional, old-fashioned elements \u2013 notably, the unison male-female vocals and plaintive folk-ish melody \u2013 and by the time the single The John Wayne kicks in with its handclaps, chugging rhythm and story about a boy failing to charm an American teen by being refused entry to a nightclub (so specific it had to be true \u2013 it happened to Appleby), you're sold by the idea of Little Green Cars.

  "<p>Accounting for around half of all infrastructure investment in the UK, the energy sector is crucial to all of our economy, supporting jobs and driving growth.</p> <p>In planning our future energy strategy, we cannot afford to become dependent on a single form of generation. To provide resilience and security in a complex world characterised by dynamic change we need a balanced energy mix: a mix that includes new nuclear, gas, new carbon capture and storage technology, and renewable energy of the right kind. An energy mix that is secure, reduces emissions, and most importantly \u2013 delivers value for money for the consumer.</p> <p>Last year the renewable energy sector created 20,000 jobs and it can do even more to boost skilled employment. Our plans for renewables have the potential to encourage as much as \u00a325bn of investment between 2013 and 2017. We have already unlocked planned investment, such as Drax's shift from coal to a predominantly biomass generator.</p> <p>The outcome of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/25/subsidy-rates-renewable-energy\" title=\"\">the recent review of support for renewables</a> has delivered for consumers as well, reducing the impact of support by \u00a311 on the average household bill over the next two years. But I know we must do even more because energy bills and their impact on businesses and households can hamper growth and hurt the vulnerable.</p> <p>The government is committed to minimising costs to consumers and as costs fall we will bring down support levels accordingly. We have seen renewable energy costs falling and our long-term goal is to enable renewables to compete against other forms of low-carbon generation without subsidy.</p> <p>As well as setting out a 10% cut in support for onshore wind for 2013-14 the recent review also set out a commitment to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/20/wind-farms-community-benefits-government\" title=\"\">call for evidence on any further cost reductions and the wider issue of community engagement</a>. This call for evidence is vital as we must protect consumers from increased costs where we can. As former UK prime minister Benjamin Disraeli said: \"there can be economy, only where there is efficiency\". It would therefore be completely wrong to subsidise any technology by a penny more than necessary.</p> <p>I am taking an active interest in the community engagement angle of this work. I have always said that renewable energy has a role to play but it must be in the right places, at the right cost and backed by genuine community support.</p> <p>The salience of aesthetics to discussions about renewables has often been neglected. I agree with philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that \"ethics and aesthetics are one\". It is part the product of philosophical liberalism that we place undue emphasis on utility and not enough on beauty. All that we do must be sensitive to local environments.</p> <p>Inspired by local interests and influenced by local communities; in that spirit I am very much looking forward to casting my eye over the responses to our call for evidence.</p> <p>I also look forward to working closely with the renewable energy industry and debating a range of issues in the coming years, as we seek to put in place the policies that will secure our energy supply for the future.</p> <p>I expect industry to challenge us where they think that our proposals won't work, and to support us when they think we are right. But I will not be starry-eyed about the influence of commercial interests. It is my responsibility to get a fair deal for consumers in the national interest. I will challenge assumptions and assertions and fight for billpayers. This applies not just to renewable energy, but across the entire portfolio.</p> <p>In these exciting and challenging times, we must develop a fresh energy strategy built on a new paradigm. I am determined to deliver a strategy in the best interests of all.</p> <p>\u2022 John Hayes is minister of state for energy at the Department of Energy and Climate Change and member of parliament for South Holland and the Deepings</p>",
  "<p>As a teenager No\u00e9 Diakubama made a sketch map of Mbandaka, on the Congo river, so as not to get lost in the forest while picking a vegetable called fumbwa. \"I remember never having seen a map of the city,\" he says.</p> <p>Thirty years later, maps of the city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are still in short supply. So Diakubama decided to create the first one of his home city. He spent hours at his computer in Brussels, where he now lives, using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/mapmaker?hl=en&amp;q=Mbandaka&amp;gw=30&amp;ll=0.046949,18.263483&amp;spn=0.041456,0.074244&amp;z=14\" title=\"\">Google Map Maker software</a> and entering the streets he could recall. He hired an assistant to tour Mbandaka by bike and name the streets on a map scanned in pdf format and printed out.</p> <p>Diakubama's efforts have been replicated across Africa by scores of amateur mapmakers who have collectively pinpointed hundreds of thousands of roads, cities and buildings in remote areas ignored by colonial cartographers. This is just one example of how the digital revolution has not only caught up in Africa, but is in some respects moving faster and differently from the west.</p> <p>\"New technologies are in the process of transforming the lives of people,\" Diakubama said. \"Mobile telephony has equipped our lives by allowing communication between cities and villages without having to move; to announce a death in the family, for example.</p> <p>\"Mobile telephony is a true revolution in a country where the landline was restricted to a few families.\"</p> <p>In Africa, necessity is the mother of invention. Instead of sharing photos on Instagram or hobbies on Pinterest, you are more likely to find a service to send money to a rural relative, or to monitor cows' gestation cycle, or for farmers to find out where they can get the best price for their goods. Technology in Africa is foremost about solving problems rather than sharing social trivia, about survival rather than entertainment \u2013 although these are flourishing too.</p> <p>South Africa hosts the third annual <a href=\"http://tech4africa.com\" title=\"\">Tech4Africa conference</a>, in Johannesburg on Wednesday, attracting innovators and entrepreneurs from a dozen countries. Among the speakers are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Simdul\" title=\"\">Sim Shagaya</a>, a Nigerian-born Harvard graduate planning to create the \"Amazon of Africa, selling Lagos's increasingly affluent consumer class everything from refrigerators to perfume to cupcakes\". His previous venture, <a href=\"http://dealdey.com/\" title=\"\">DealDey</a>, which offers Groupon-style deals, is now the top-grossing ecommerce site in Nigeria with 350,000 subscribers.</p> <p>The forum will also be addressed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mbwana\" title=\"\">Mbwana Alliy</a>, the Tanzanian founder of an Africa-focused technology venture capital fund, and Verone Mankou of Congo-Brazzaville, who designed a tablet computer that sells for a third of the price of the iPad. Mankou, 26, has also launched an African smartphone, the Elikia, which means \"hope\" in the Lingala language.</p> <p>Tech4Africa is the brainchild of Gareth Knight, a 35-year-old South African based in London. \"If you remember in Britain in 2002-4, you would see the vans for ISPs (internet service providers) installing broadband,\" he said. \"Everyone was getting online even if they still had to use an internet cafe.</p> <p>\"What happened in the UK and US at the turn of the century is now happening in Africa on the mobile platform. It's being driven by social and commercial utility needs \u2013 for example, when people want to send money. The market is much bigger than the original one in the UK and US. More and more people are going to get online in the next couple of years and they'll want all the same things.\"</p> <p>In the world's poorest continent, only one in three people has access to electricity \u2013 but far more than that have a mobile phone. Africa is the fastest growing region for mobiles in the world, and the biggest after Asia, according to the GSM Association. There are now an estimated 700m sim cards in Africa.</p> <p>Mobiles overcome some of the endemic problems that have stifled progress on the continent: poor infrastructure (both in transport and power transmission), sparsely populated rural areas and widespread poverty.</p> <p>The basic feature phones that are still the most popular are vital for this environment. With small non-touchscreens, they have long battery life, though people find innovative ways to recharge, for example from car batteries.</p> <p>Most have an FM radio, still the greatest communications medium in the developing world. And many have a small torch.</p> <p>In east Africa, mobile money is used as frequently as paper money; the region accounts for four-fifths of the world's transactions. With text messages it is possible to send money to another mobile that can be cashed out of the system using tens of thousands of participating agents. It is estimated that half of Kenya's GDP moves through mobile money, mostly using the pioneering service M-Pesa, which has some 14m users.</p> <p>Mobiles have fostered communication like no other technology ever before, linking villages in a split second that would previously have taken days to reach on foot or by road. Information services via text message allow farmers to learn more about best practices, market prices and weather conditions. The unemployed can subscribe to text alerts about job vacancies instead of having to travel.</p> <p>Alan Knott-Craig, a 35-year-old South African tech entrepreneur, said: \"It's lighting up the dark continent. People are talking with each other. In the old days, you couldn't talk to your family if you were a migrant worker; now you can. The next level is money. When you light it up with money, you're giving people social freedom as well as economic freedom.\"</p> <p>Local entrepreneurs in hubs such as Accra, <a href=\"http://www.siliconcape.com\" title=\"\">Cape Town</a>, Lagos and Nairobi have the <a href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/?id=257\" title=\"\">advantage</a> of knowing Africa's particular needs when competing with the Silicon Valley giants. Numerous social networks specifically for mobiles have sprung up, offering cheap or free communication for their users. Mxit and 2go from South Africa have 44m and 20m users respectively, the latter mostly in Nigeria. Others like Motribe and FrontlineSMS offer mobile communities.</p> <p>According to Internet World Stats, Africa still has the world's lowest internet penetration rate at 15.6%. Desktop PCs and tablets such as the iPad are relatively few and far between and have been leapfrogged by the more appropriate technology offered by the mobile. In conflict-riven Somalia, for example, fierce unregulated competition has made mobiles affordable and prevalent, whereas internet penetration stands at 1.14% of the population.</p> <p>Among Africa's broadband-linked minority, Facebook and Twitter, blogs and online magazines, music and video sharing sites, are thriving. That includes the political realm: atrocities that might once have been hidden by an authoritarian regime can be quickly exposed to a global audience, while the follies of leaders are held to scrutiny and mockery as never before.

  "<p>The UN's high commissioner for refugees, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said that his agency has less than half the money it needs to look after hundreds of thousands of Africans driven from their homes by conflict and forgotten by the international community, and may have to start cutting its spending on education and repatriation.</p> <p>Guterres said that as international attention and sympathy had drifted away from Africa, the UNHCR had so far managed to keep its African operations going by using money saved by cutting overheads at its headquarters in Geneva, but those funds had run out.</p> <p>As the Syrian civil war has increasingly dominated the headlines, world attention has drifted away from intractable conflicts in Africa and the refugee populations they have created, Guterres said.</p> <p>\"All our African operations are substantially underfunded,\" he told the Guardian. \"In Chad, we have about 280,000 Darfurian refugees, not to mention the 60,000 refugees from the Central African Republic who are in the south of Chad. Four or five years ago, Darfur was very much under the attention of the international community. It was one of the best funded operations we had.\"</p> <p>By contrast, the UNHCR currently has only a quarter of the $177m (\u00a3110m) needed to provide for the refugees in Chad. Funds needed for emergencies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Sahel are also severely undersubscribed. Of the $1.9bn required for refugees across the whole continent, only a third has been forthcoming from donors, a reflection of how the problem has slipped from the global agenda. To make up the shortfall, the UNHCR has been using funds freed by efficiency savings, but it is not a permanent solution.</p> <p>\"We have dramatically reduced our overheads. In Geneva we had a staff of 1,000 and now we have less than 700. That has allowed us to use un-earmarked money that might otherwise have been used in headquarters to be used in these forgotten emergencies,\" Guterres said. He added that that still left budgets far short of needs, and \"now we have exhausted all our reserves\" and the only alternative was to start cutting support to refugees.</p> <p>\"Obviously, if at a certain moment we are not able to maintain the same level of funding, we will have to start cutting a certain number of services, which is something we don't want to do, because it has to do with not only with basic needs of people but also their dignity,\" Guterres said. \"Of course, we will always maintain the life-saving activities but people \u2026 do not only need water and food and shelter. They also need education, and self-reliance in their life, and these are the sort of investments that are totally impossible, forcing us to restrain our activities to core life-saving and protection action, which is not what we want.\"</p> <p>The cuts will also mean an end to investment in the refugees' devastated home towns and villages that would have encouraged voluntary returns and thus a long-term decline in refugee numbers. Earlier this year, there were reports of the return of about 100,000 internally displaced people from camps inside Darfur to their home villages, but Guterres said there had been a very small decline in the number of Darfur refugees over the border in Chad.</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Times has imposed a recruitment freeze and a ban on all but the most essential travel, to control costs in a tough advertising market.</p> <p>John Ridding, the Financial Times chief executive, outlined the measures in an internal email on Tuesday to the newspaper's senior management group titled \"Cost control/profit protection\", seen by MediaGuardian.</p> <p>The measures, which apply to all staff, include a freeze on recruitment and stricter rules on travel expenses.</p> <p>\"Unless there is a clear commercial opportunity that will deliver this year, or an essential editorial trip, we should let our global network do the work (that is what it is there for),\" said Ridding. \"Only the most vital of journeys will be approved.\"</p> <p>He said that board members will also be focused on finding revenues and saving costs so staff should not take up their time with non-essential and non-urgent requests.</p> <p>The measures will run until Christmas and have been implemented following a marked downturn in the advertising climate, including weak third-quarter performances by Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP and Maurice L\u00e9vy's Publicis Groupe.</p> <p>\"As you'll probably have noticed from recent results publications and statements from advertising agencies and news media groups, the advertising market has taken another turn for the worse,\" Ridding said. \"And while we continue to take market share, it is clear that conditions have become tougher and that the overall advertising 'pie' is under pressure.

  "<p>What did you use your mobile device for this morning? Read the news, write a few e-mails, or catch up on the scores of your favourite team? If you were Oliver Bussmann, CIO of SAP, chances are you approved a 1.7 million euro purchase approval from your iPad. At least, that is what he did the morning I caught up with him in Las Vegas for SAP Tech Ed. The vibrant Bussmann simply stated, \"It's cool, no?\" That kind of mobile cool is just the beginning.</p> <p>Bussmann, the internally focused half of the mobile executive dream team, along with Sanjay Poonen, head of SAP's mobile division, is helping lead the charge to transform the culture and perception of SAP. \"My goal is to have SAP perceived as a cool innovative company, a place you'd want to work,\" Bussmann said. Bussmann understands the importance of perception as it affects brand, trust, and culture. He believes that SAP is on track today. \"We have moved into mobility and other topics that are easy for the public to understand.\" When it comes to the cool factor, Bussmann, borrowing Poonen's phrase, said he wants SAP to become \"the Apple of the enterprise.\"</p> <p>Bussman is just the man to pull it off, too. He has accomplished more over the last twelve months at SAP than most CIOs accomplish in their career in an organisation. Bussmann has won the 2012 European CIO award, 2012 #1 Social CIO, 2012 IT Strategy, WSJ Top 25 Technology Executives, 2012 European IT Workplace, and 2012 Enterprise Architecture. What do all these awards say about SAP? \"It's not all about me, it's about my team,\" Bussmann modestly proposed. \"In 2009 we identified six important strategic areas. These areas included innovation, investing in people and the workplace, and communications internal and external.\" Bussmann noted that \"This is reflected in the awards.\"</p> <p>The lifestyle of an executive of Bussmann's caliber aligns perfectly with mobility and he leverages it to its fullest. Part of being CIO of an organisation with global presence means you are infrequently in the same place for very long \u2013 and rarely in your office. In the past this might have meant there was an impact on productivity or a need to find workarounds to common tasks. Bussmann, however, doesn't seem to miss a beat with the two primary go-to apps on his iPad; SAP Box and e-mail.</p> <p>SAP Box is an internal corporate app that allows users the functionality of a Box or Dropbox, but in a private, secure cloud. For Bussmann, SAP Box offers a central location to store and organise sensitive content. \"I place my day-to-day documents in SAP Box. I have all documents in the order of my day, notes, presentation, et cetera. I have everything with me,\" Bussmann said. He also enthusiastically told me that because of SAP Box he got rid of not one, but two printers he had in his office. \"We have been talking about the paperless office for years and now it is coming true.\"</p> <p>Consuming e-mail is another area where Bussmann gains a huge advantage through working mobile. With all his travel and meetings, e-mail on his mobile devices isn't a convenience \u2013 it's essential. Bussmann gets two to three hundred e-mails per day. As he explained, \"Writing, reading, and organising e-mails is usually faster on my mobile device than on a laptop. On the iPad I can move e-mails back and forth into topics and categories quicker, especially now with iOS 6's VIP folders. This is a better e-mail client; it's easier to organise by subject.\"</p> <p>As a CIO, I was also very curious to hear his take on mobility at a corporate level, outside of his personal use. Bussmann sees mobility reaching the point where redundancies can be eliminated. Bussmann has begun to identify groups that carry both an iPad and a laptop. \"We have to spend more time thinking about certain user groups who don't need laptops anymore. Our first target is the sales personnel,\" he stated.</p> <p>Bussmann views moving business groups to a mobile-only approach as not only a cost-savings measure, through the elimination of multiple devices, but also a productivity move. He does, however, recognise the very real challenges of a mobile-only sales force. As he pointed out, \"Content creation is a challenge. If they have to create a PowerPoint presentation or modify twenty pages, it will be difficult. We are used to using a mouse for that. It will be the same kind of learning curve as moving away from BlackBerry to touch-screen phones. The bottom line is it's a question of how to adapt.\"</p> <p>Adaption is proving to be a real strength at SAP under the guidance of Bussmann. He imagines the future of mobile, when combined with in-memory technology like SAP Hana, will bring about the next leap in business transformation. \"I preach that if you have the ability to look at your business data in real time it will evolve like e-mail consumption; it's always up-to-date and you look at them multiple times an hour. That's the change I predict. You will not only check your e-mail, you will also see how your numbers are doing.\"</p> <p>Bussmann believes that the ability to deliver an individual employee's relevant statistics down to the mobile device will provide an unprecedented business advantage. He predicts that the \"ability to combine mobile and data will define new business value; that you'll always be on top of your business.\" This value will extend from the C-level executives all the way down to interns.</p> <p>Bussmann observed that \"Today, in certain markets, if there is a change, you have to know it immediately and you have to respond immediately because you have an obligation.\" Bussmann is the embodiment of an organisation responding to the changing marketing and technology landscape. With Bussmann at the internal technical helm, SAP will not only succeed in responding to that obligation, but also continue to demonstrate what it means to lead by example.</p> <p>Stay tuned for more mobile insights from the head of SAP's mobile division, Sanjay Poonen.

  "<p>Nobody quite knows what to make of the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/may/26/italy-5-star-movement\" title=\"\">Five Star movement</a>\" in Italy which is emerging as the surprise winner of this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/sicily-gay-governor-rosario-crocetta\" title=\"\">Sicilian elections</a>. But one thing is for sure: all the traditional parties are terrified of what might happen in the general elections, which will probably be held in spring 2013. This political movement, led by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/10/italy-grillo-swimming-straits-messina-video\" title=\"\">Beppe Grillo</a> \u2013 a volcanic comedian with a huge mop of shaggy greying hair \u2013 is threatening to tear Italy's political establishment apart.</p> <p>The rise of the movement has been sudden. In local elections in May 2012, a Five Star representative was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/21/parma-mayor-pizzarotti-beppe-grillo\" title=\"\">elected mayor of Parma</a>, one of Italy's richest cities, which until the late 1990s was a centre-left stronghold, and was then governed (badly and dishonestly) by Silvio Berlusconi's party for more than a decade. And in Sicily, the Five Star movement this weekend gained more votes than any other party and had 15 regional councillors elected. In typical exuberant fashion, Grillo had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/beppe-grillo-sicily-election-campaign\" title=\"\">swum across the Straits of Messina</a> (3km) to launch his campaign.</p> <p>So, who is Grillo and what is the Five Star movement? The first part is easier to answer. Grillo is 64 years old and from Genoa. He was a popular and clever comedian who starred on Italian TV in the 1970s and 1980s. Then he did something unthinkable: he called Bettino Craxi's Socialist party \"thieves\" on national television. This led to his banishment for a number of years, and in the meantime Grillo built up a huge audience with a series of ferocious shows across Italy.</p> <p>For a long time, Grillo was anti-technology: his show would end with him smashing up a computer. But then he embraced the internet. He understood, before almost anyone else in Italy, the political potential of the web and its ability to undercut the country's stifling and boring media monopolies and party-controlled news outlets. Thus, via his incredibly popular blog, and latterly through Twitter, he began to spread a potent anti-political message. This linked up with both a long-running hatred and distrust of politicians among many Italian voters, and the exacerbation of these deeply rooted tendencies during the Berlusconian era (1994-12), a time of almost obscene levels of corruption, patronage, clientelism and cronyism at all levels.</p> <p>Grillo railed against all this, and he did his homework. He documented absurd levels of state contributions for nonexistent political newspapers, for example, and drew on widespread disgust concerning parliamentary pension rights and payoffs. He attacked both left and right, almost equally. Berlusconi was \"a psycho-dwarf\", Pierluigi Bersani (the leader of the centre-left Democratic party) was a \"zombie\" and \"Gargamella\" (a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargamel\" title=\"\">character</a> from the Smurfs cartoons).</p> <p>His language was violent and straightforward, and he organised a number of \"fuck-off days\" of protest against the governing parties (and in fact against all parties). He also attacked big business and called for more shareholder democracy.</p> <p>When the Five Star movement was formed in 2009, Italy was falling apart: still governed by a moribund Berlusconi government, the country was paralysed by corruption scandals on an almost daily basis, while sliding into a deep recession and financial crisis. Not surprisingly, people stopped voting altogether, or began to abandon the major parties. A bestselling book detailed the grotesque waste perpetuated by a robber class of politicians. Its title was eloquent: La Casta, The Caste.</p> <p>Grillo's followers, as far as we know, tend to be young and idealistic. Most of his candidates have no political experience. Many, if not all, have grown up with the internet and use it almost exclusively to communicate and obtain information and news. Grillo's party is both postmodern and post-political. But the Five Star movement combines these new elements with old-style, anti-political populism.</p> <p>Anti-politics has a long history in Italy, going back to fascism itself, and moving through short-lived movements like the Ordinary Man (L'Uomo Qualunque) which briefly emerged in the 1940s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord\" title=\"\">Lega Nord</a> used a highly successful brand of regionalist populism and gained access to power structures at a national and local level as a result.</p> <p>What does Grillo's success mean for Italy? It is interesting to look at the Five Star \"programme\", which is almost entirely negative. The manifesto consists largely of a series of existing laws that will be abrogated on taking power, plus a bit of ecology (Grillo is almost messianic about the environment) and a good dose of euroscepticism. It is not a programme for government. Grillo has nothing at all to say to Italy's 5 million immigrants, and very little to say to Europe. His message is for Italians only, and his violent and anti-institutional language has attracted occasional accusations that he is a \"web fascist\". Others have seen him as an internet-based version of Berlusconi. There are also questions about his control over the \"movement\", which appears to be absolute, and perhaps somewhat similar to the power structures that he is so quick to criticise in others.</p> <p>It may be that the movement will fade and die like so many other populist movements have done. But it could also be true that they are here to stay. Elections are coming up, and the major parties are as unpopular, weak and corrupt as they have ever been. Whatever happens, the Five Star movement can no longer be ignored, and the violent reaction from the political (and intellectual) elite to the rise of Grillo is a clear indication that we need to take this comedian very seriously indeed.</p>",

Like Katrina and Mitch, we have heard the last of Sandy.</p> <p><strong>How great was the death toll? </strong>In the US the number is put at 18 (though that may rise) \u2013 about the same number that died in the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/the-great-storm-of-1987-25-years-on\" title=\"\">great storm of 1987</a> in the UK. Sandy has killed several times that number in Cuba and Haiti. Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005, led to more than 1,800 deaths.</p> <p><strong>How will Sandy affect the presidential election? </strong>Obama hopes that by flying back to Washington ahead of a rally in Florida and declaring a disaster, he will look presidential. Pundits reckon the storm has blown away&#xa0;any momentum his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, might have had. But it is also likely to deter early voters from turning out, and they tend to be disproportionately Democrat supporters.</p> <p><strong>Might the election have to </strong><a href=\"http://www.nj.com/us-politics/index.ssf/2012/10/could_hurricane_sandy_delay_th.html\" title=\"\"><strong>be delayed</strong></a><strong>? </strong>According to constitutional experts, this is a \"legal black hole\". It has never happened, and law-makers are eager to avoid a postponement, but some experts suggest states do have the right to delay if holding the election on the designated day (6 November) is problematic. If any did so, however, they could open themselves up to challenges by Congress. Given that there is still a week to go and the level of destruction appears to be containable, the odds are that no state will opt out.</p> <p><strong>Why did the lights in the </strong><a href=\"http://thewall.com/topics/51127-while-almost-everyone-else-is-dark-the-lights-are\" title=\"\"><strong>Goldman Sachs building</strong></a><strong> stay on while New York City hospital had to be evacuated when its back-up power system failed? </strong>Because Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking and securities firm, and a hospital is \u2013 in the last analysis \u2013 just a hospital.</p> <p><strong>What's happening to </strong><a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/10/29/how_sandy_hits_the_homeless/\" title=\"\"><strong>the homeless</strong></a><strong>? </strong>The New York City Department of Homeless Services relocated nine homeless centres, evacuated more than 1,000 people and made strenuous efforts to encourage the use of shelters, but some of New York's 50,000-plus homeless population preferred to take their chance on the streets, perhaps relying on reflected light from Goldman Sachs Tower.</p> <p><strong>Did the </strong><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/uk-storm-sandy-crane-idUKBRE89S13X20121030\" title=\"\"><strong>dangling crane</strong></a><strong> next to the luxury apartment building near Central Park ever collapse? </strong>When last seen, it was still dangling. </p> <p><strong>Did no one think that a 50-metre-high crane might pose a risk? </strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the crane had been inspected and deemed not to be a risk, but that God moved in mysterious ways. \"Just because it was inspected, that doesn't mean God doesn't do things or that metal doesn't fail.\"</p> <p><strong>What will the disaster cost? </strong>Storm damage is put at about $20bn, of which $8bn will be insured losses. Hefty sums, but only about a quarter of the cost of the damage wrought by Katrina.</p> <p><strong>How will the US economy cope? </strong>Rather well, bizarrely. Destruction is ultimately thought to be good for business, producing investment \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.680news.com/business/article/416736--sandy-may-slow-us-economy-in-short-term-but-areas-like-construction-will-benefit-in-long-run\" title=\"\">especially in reconstruction</a> \u2013 that more than offsets what has been lost. Analysts say that in the long term Sandy will give a $40bn boost to the economy. At a macroeconomic level, God does indeed move in mysterious ways.</p> <p><strong>How will the economy of Haiti, which was also battered by Sandy, cope? </strong>The absence of tweeters, bloggers and corporate analysts in Port-au-Prince makes that difficult to answer.</p>",
  "<p>Haiti's government has learned important lessons about responding to natural disasters, say leading charities in the country, but there is still concern about how the Caribbean nation will cope with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.</p> <p>Haiti has been hardest hit by the disaster so far, with at least 52 people killed and more than 200,000 left homeless as the storm passed by the country at the end of last week before it went on to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts\">hit the north-eastern United States</a> last night.</p> <p>There are fears of severe food shortages due to rotting crops, as well as infrastructure problems after roads were flooded and homes destroyed. The country was still coming to terms with the effects of a major earthquake in 2010 and last year's Hurricane Isaac. </p> <p>Prime minister Laurent Lamothe <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/27/3069750/sandy-still-a-hurricane-heads.html#storylink=cpy\">has said</a>: \"It should not be normal that every time it rains, we have a catastrophe throughout the country.\" The Guardian spoke to three NGO workers in Haiti about the effects of the storm and the nation's prospects of dealing with the crisis.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen#t=0m45s\">Prospery Raymond, country manager for Haiti for Christian Aid</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398576429\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351609141107/Prospery-Raymond-of-Chris-004.jpg\" alt=\"Prospery Raymond of Christian Aid\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prospery Raymond of Christian Aid</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Raymond said the areas most seriously affected by Hurricane Sandy were in the south-east of the country, in the Grand'Anse and Nippes departments.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There I think it is still quite wet. The rivers are going down. In general the departments have put down the [threat level]; it was red, now it is normal. They are trying to repair the roads and bridges that collapsed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the most serious impact of the storm had been on agriculture - the loss of crops and livestock. Christian Aid was going out at the moment to see what the state and other organisations would not be able to provide, \"and to provide what is missing\". They would be helping repair houses, replace livestock and provide seeds.</p> <p>Asked about the government's response, Raymond said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be honest I think this time they did what they could, because they managed to put more than 20,000 people in temporary shelter, but in total you have 200,000 people that were affected by Sandy. That means there is a huge gap. We think we could provide some support to complement what they are doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked what the government could do differently, he focused on altering the environment to allow nature to better combat extreme weather events.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Christian Aid [is pushing] the government to take the environment situation more seriously, because if the country had the right trees, the right forests in place, I think that could help. It's really important for them to prioritise this in their future budget, for example. The Ministry of Environment in Haiti has 0.65% of the budget. I don't think it is normal. As a priority sector they need to receive more in order to help Haiti have better cover in terms of trees, and that could help us with all these hurricane storms that will come in here.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1032333-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-lisa-laumann-of-save-the-children-talks-to-guardian-s-paul-owen\">Lisa Laumann, Save the Children's country director for Haiti </a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398576430\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351608895921/Lisa-Laumann-Save-the-Chi-004.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Laumann, Save the Children\u2019s country director for Haiti\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Laumann, Save the Children\u2019s country director for Haiti</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Laumann explained what happened when the storm arrived last week.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The eye of the storm didn't even hit the country. It went through Cuba, and we were at quite a distance from it. So when it came through it was still quite strong, although it was just a tropical storm. [It was] followed by days of intensive, intensive rain; that Thursday and Friday of last week were just \u2026 I've hardly seen so much rain in a long time.</p> <p>It really led to a lot of damage in the country. There's been a substantial amount of damage to roads, a substantial amount of flooding in agricultural areas raising serious concerns about crops, and then of course with the standing water and the flow of water the increased concern about diarrhoea and disease, particularly cholera.</p> </blockquote> <p>But she was reasonably optimistic about the government's ability to deal with these issues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we saw during tropical storm Isaac and I think in tropical storm Sandy as well is a government that is challenged by the recurrent disasters that hit the country but also a government that is increasingly able to deal with this type of disaster. By that I mean that the government has a national system for the management of risks and disaster, and in the last two crises that have hit the country it has taken the lead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Organisations such as her own had \"played a role in preparation and response\", but increasingly they were working under government leadership. \"I don't want to sound like I think the government has infinite capacity to respond \u2026 but I think it's important to recognise that the government does have increasing ability to coordinate and manage disaster preparedness and response here.\"</p> <p>Why did so many people die, despite the eye of the storm not hitting Haiti directly?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People die because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time or because the infrastructure is not such that it protects them from incidents that occur. I think if the road infrastructure was stronger in this country, if there were better flood control, fewer people would die in emergencies like these.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was speaking from a high-up area of Port-au-Prince, where there was no standing water, and children were out and off to school. \"There certainly has been damage to some buildings, but it looks from here like a fairly normal day.\"</p> <p>But in the camps for those made homeless by the storm \"it's different\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People lost their few assets that they had. They were flooded out \u2026 Life is much more challenging for them. It's hard when you lose most of your possessions or have them destroyed by a storm.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the south of the country there was a lot of road damage, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last damage map that I took a look at showed damage in pretty much every department of the southern part of the country, much worse than the north. When you think about the fact that Haiti is already a road-challenged country, that's going to make problems for people who need to move around and for people who need to respond. Bridges have been broken, sections of road have been washed out, there's some land sliding over some of the roads.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian\">Kristie van de Wetering, programme director, Tearfund</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398576431\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351609025589/Kristie-van-de-Wetering-o-004.jpg\" alt=\"Kristie van de Wetering of Tearfund in Haiti\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristie van de Wetering of Tearfund in Haiti</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Van de Wetering explained why the situation in Haiti was so serious.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hurricane Sandy has really tipped the scale of an already fragile situation. We had tremendous amounts of water, tremendous amounts of flooding, severe winds, and we're seeing those effects across the country, with damaged homes, flooded homes, people displaced, crops and gardens destroyed and lives lost: 52 lives were lost, and it's extremely heartbreaking.</p> </blockquote> <p>She had just got off the phone to a friend whose colleague lost his entire family in a landslide that destroyed their home with his family inside.</p> <p>Van de Wetering said that since the earthquake of 2010 and Hurricane Isaac last year Tearfund had been helping repair homes and \"to address some of the agriculture and livelihood issues\", especially in the rural mountains. \"Now Hurricane Sandy has created even more need and to be sure this response will also be addressing the needs of some of those people who now find themselves in a very difficult situation.\"</p> <p>And she explained why Sandy had caused food shortages:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We can look at the context prior to both tropical storm Isaac and Hurricane Sandy with increasing food prices and food insecurity throughout the last several months. With tropical storm Isaac and now Sandy a lot of the crops have been destroyed. There are numerous crops that were ready for harvesting that have now been destroyed. Plantain trees and plantations ripped down, gardens flooded, and so in a country that primarily supports itself agriculturally, this is an extreme hit to the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>There would now be an increase in food prices and \"food insecurity\", with families finding it more difficult to harvest or sell their crops, she said. This would make it more difficult for them to send their children to school or repair their homes. Flooding and damaged homes were an immediate problem, \"but in the coming months we're going to be looking at a real severe food security situation\".</p> <p>She was less optimistic than Laumann that the government was well-prepared to deal with this disaster, coming as it does so soon after the 2010 earthquake and Isaac in 2011.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has been active from the very beginning. The national disaster management system has been mobilised early on, and this is a nationwide system. And the government has also been meeting with international organisations to coordinate the response, and has also allocated an additional $800,000 for initial response actions, so they have been very present and very active, but the reality is that they're stretched in terms of capacity and in terms of ability to respond \u2026</p> <p>The capacity for the government to respond even prior to these storms was starting to diminish. Funding is drying up for cholera response. So, big concern. There'll need to be a national joint effort with all key stakeholders to respond and to respond swiftly.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>If you are not a games industry insider or a very committed player you may have missed a rather damaging controversy last week. It started when journalists attending this month's Games Media Awards were given the chance to win a PS3 by tweeting about a certain game and including its hashtag in their message. I didn't do it because I felt it was tantamount amount to a sponsored tweet, a form of advertising that the Guardian would not permit, but the fact that some attendees <em>did</em> enter the competition angered a lot of industry watchers.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, the TV comedian and Eurogamer columnist Robert Florence wrote <a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-24-lost-humanity-18-a-table-of-doritos\">a damning article</a> calling into question the increasingly close relationship between games journalists and games publishers. Later, certain elements of this scathing diatribe were removed due to complaints made by a writer criticised in the text, and Florence announced that he would no longer be contributing to the site. A fireball of invective and criticism&nbsp;then consumed industry Twitter communications for the next three days. Veteran games writer Stuart Campbell has provided a lengthy timeline of the controversy <a href=\"http://wosland.podgamer.com/the-wainwright-profile/\">here</a>, and Robert Florence has written a response to the ensuing Twitter storm on <a href=\"http://botherer.org\"> the personal site of John Walker</a>, the editor of PC gaming site, Rock Paper Shotgun.</p> <p>It has, in short, been a difficult and depressing week for games journalism. Accusations and insults have been chucked around and the impartiality of games news sources, which rely heavily on working&nbsp;relationships with publishers, has been brought into question. It seems there are a lot of gamers who believe that games writers are little better than PR shills, trading favourable features and reviews for exclusive access to new titles or juicy freebies.</p> <p>Certainly, as in all forms of entertainment writing, there is close and regular interaction between the journalists and the PR departments of the major content providers. Access to preview and review material is now tightly controlled in this industry. This is partly because the threat of software piracy is ever present and terrifying to companies that have spent millions of dollars and countless working hours to produce Triple A titles. But it's also because publishers want to engineer an environment in which their products are viewed and discussed favourably. Getting access to new games now involves a relationship between journalist and producer, an understanding that there are two motives being uneasily aligned. We must now consider this properly.</p> <p>The situation is far from perfect, it involves compromise, and yet somehow it is the way entertainment writing works \u2014 especially in the digital era. Some might also draw a distinction here between entertainment writing and news journalism. Very few games writers indulge in the popularly accepted definition of \"journalism\" \u2014 an investigative procedure in which the aim is exposure. As William Randolph Hearst famously wrote, \"news is something somebody doesn't want printed; all else is advertising\". </p> <p>There is truth in that, of course. But it is also true that entertainment writing is about providing people with the information they want on things they love \u2013 like games, movies and music. The best entertainment writers do more than that \u2013 they analyse and interpret the industry; they provide context and draw interesting conclusions; they add depth and soul to the experience of learning about new things. Standards of quality must be the same.</p> <p>However, writing about games can be fraught with difficulties and ambiguities. The increasing cost of producing games has made publishers more guarded and controlling. At the same time, the rise of blogging culture has created a scene in which games journalism and fan content co-exist and combine. There are major debates going on about what journalism should mean in the digital era \u2013 there are arguments that it is mutating into aggregation. Alan Rusbridger's concept of open journalism suggests that some stories are best explored in partnership with bloggers and other participants outside of mainstream journalism. New frameworks have to be established in this complex arena; we also need to set clear standards if we work in partnership with bloggers too.</p> <p>I have been a games writer for 18 years, and I have seen many changes in the industry. Today, the job I do involves a lot of communication with the PR departments of major publishers \u2014 so ultimately it is up to myself to consider the boundaries within the context of the Guardian's overall code.</p> <p>I have thought a lot about my role in the last week while watching this controversy unfold and it has made me ask serious questions. From a personal and professional standpoint, I put the reader first in everything I write or commission \u2013 this is sacrosanct. Games writing might not be as \"important\" as other areas of the news media, but it must be carried out with integrity. I also believe that most PR professionals are helpful individuals, playing and promoting games they adore.</p> <p>However, during a period in which the credibility and impartiality of games writers is being questioned, it's worth reiterating or spelling out how games are covered on this site, and how I wish to increase transparency.</p> <p><strong>ALL articles resulting from hosted press trips and events will be flagged as such.</strong> <br>This practice is common throughout the Guardian and it forms part of the newspaper's code of conduct. Press trips are a very useful element of games writing and they can result in fantastic and interesting articles \u2014 they allow unique access to the people who develop the content. But it is important for readers to know when something they are reading is the direct result of a trip or event funded by a publisher. </p> <p><strong>I will no longer commission reviews based on publisher-organised events.</strong> <br>Often major publishers, rightfully fearful of their game code slipping into the wrong hands and being pirated before release, will hold special review events. This is really specific to the games industry, at least to the best of my knowledge. Journalists are invited to attend and can play forthcoming titles, usually for a couple of days, without distraction. They're convenient, well-managed and well-intentioned, but they also limit the reviewer's time with the game and can be perceived by some as a questionable form of collaboration between publisher and critic. Non-attendance at such events will mean that we sometimes provide our reviews later than other sources. I think it's worth it.</p> <p>The last week has been depressing and damaging, but it should not end with games writers closing ranks and denying that there are ambiguities and dilemmas that must be addressed. The best outcome would be for all of us, including myself, to rethink how we engage with and report on this magnificent and powerful medium.</p> <p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>Since I wrote the above article, the situation has moved on. Here are some links to further articles on this matter:</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-10-30-editors-blog-lost-humanity-18-aftermath\">Eurogamer:</a></strong> Tom Bramwell, the site's editor, writes with real honesty and bravery about the Robert Florence situation.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/30/rpss-position-on-the-eurogamerflorence-debacle/\">Rock Paper Shotgun</a></strong>: An official response from the PC gaming blog, written by its editor, John Walker.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.vg247.com/2012/10/31/doritosgate-after-the-storm-lets-clean-ourselves-up/\">VG247</a>:</strong> The video game new site's editor Patrick Garratt has provided his own slant on the controversy, ending with a new set of editorial rules.</p>",
  "<p>The explosion in popularity of smartphones, tablets and the app revolution has fuelled a more than doubling in mobile advertising to \u00a3500m this year \u2013 just four years after the sector struggled to attract \u00a325m.</p> <p>This should be a wake-up call to travel/retail businesses to start taking mobile seriously \u2013 because consumers are \u2013 but not just as an advertising platform.</p> <p>I'm not surprised by the high levels of growth in mobile advertising but would only see this as the start of a much larger shift towards the mobile platform for the rest of this decade. Spend is dominated by paid search \u2013 which is ironic given the low levels of mobile-optimised websites that are out there and, therefore, the appalling service being given to customers.</p> <p>As businesses wake up to the fact that their customers are browsing and shopping on their phones, and then fix the website that customers land on so that it works properly on the screen size and OS of the customer's device, search and then display will boom, as they did on desktop.</p> <p>I can see display further increasing as we develop and design better ways to show adverts on small screens. Translating banners is not the answer. The technical capabilities of phones, combined with (eventually) better network connectivity and data capacity will see a move to richer ad formats that will really help both business and customers.</p> <h2>4G is not a game changer (yet)</h2> <p>Ofcom research reveals that the next generation of mobile technology will deliver more than 200% of the capacity of existing 3G technologies, using the same amount of spectrum \u2013 the airwaves that carry information between customers' mobile handsets and the internet.</p> <p>This increased capacity is essential in meeting the UK's rapid increase in mobile traffic, fuelled by the growth of smartphones and mobile broadband data services.</p> <p>And yet, despite the launch of 4G by EE, nothing is going to happen at any important level for consumers or businesses for several years to come.</p> <p>As we have come to learn with 2.5G and then 3G, network coverage is patchy at best \u2013 even in large conurbations. Even now, a decade after the 3G licence auction, 3G coverage across the UK is not a given.</p> <p>EE's initial network will take in 16 city-centre locations around the UK.</p> <p>And currently there are only a few handsets with 4G access. Given contract lengths, product developments and pricing, it takes two to three years for consumer adoption of a new technology (or network capability) to begin to reach meaningful levels (25-50%). The iPhone changed the smartphone landscape for ever in early 2007, and yet it is only in the past 12 months that the UK (and here we are in the top tier) has seen adoption of smartphones break through the 50% mark.</p> <p>So 4G will be important \u2013 it will enable higher quality product imagery to be looked at and explored; it will allow more information to be communicated at acceptable timescales; it will allow video to be used instead of still imagery. If 3G was the equivalent of colour telly, 4G can be seen as the move to HD. But not for several years. Be ready, think about it, plan for it.</p> <p>But fix the basic plumbing first.</p> <h2>How travel and retail brands are wasting money in mobile search</h2> <p>OK, this might be quite a basic point to make, but it's surprising how few retailers have mobile-optimised sites. It's estimated that <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/10111-is-your-mobile-strategy-fit-for-purpose\" title=\"\">80% of brands don't have mobile sites</a>. And yet search results are driving customers to these URLs from searches on mobile.</p> <p>Google have publicly reported that more than 50% of any internet session on a mobile phone starts with search. And \"shopping\" is an important level of activity for most people. Critically for the high street, further research from Google suggests that search on mobile results in \"an action\" within an hour, compared with about a week for a desktop search. So customers use their phones to look for store locations, review something they've seen in a store (see what other customers thought of it; see if it's cheaper elsewhere) when they are <em>on the high street</em>. More than two-thirds (71%) of smartphone owners research products on their mobile, with 32% doing it on a weekly basis.</p> <p>But this \"mobile shopping\" on smartphones still isn't translating into mobile conversions. When asked what they had done after researching products on their mobile, 38% of respondents said they completed a purchase in-store compared with 25% who made a purchase on their smartphone.</p> <p>Last year, 17% of people asked said they researched travel on their phones, but just 3% made the booking there, which suggests travel firms need to improve their mobile services.</p> <p>The flip side of this is that, for holidays and travel, these numbers have increased by about 10 percentage points in the past nine months. Customers have evolved their behaviours faster than business.</p> <p>There is a real opportunity for brands to become creative here \u2013 as with the famous John Lewis promise, which has now been extended to cover online for customers in-store. Better to get 90% of a sale than have the stock left on your shelves gathering dust? And customers will be prepared to forego some savings for the satisfaction of walking away with a physical product there and then. Perhaps there is an opportunity for a return to more haggling within our economy. How can a fixed-price online site compete against a human being empowered to do a deal?</p> <p>Data from a Rackspace survey found that <a href=\"http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/10788-smartphones-and-tablets-drive-an-increase-in-impulse-buying-online\" title=\"\">mobile is helping to drive an increase in impulse buying</a>, particularly for clothes and music. So, as well as having an educated and empowered workforce, fixing the website to work for a smaller screen, and ensuring that the checkout process is as simple as possible (for example, Amazon allows customers to log in to their accounts, precluding the need to fill in credit card and delivery address details time after time \u2013 and, as mobiles are so personal, most people never log out of these apps or sites on their phones) so they don't deter these impulse purchases.</p> <h2>Brands need to consider how they can transform their businesses through mobile</h2> <p>For many retailers their mobile strategy doesn't really extend any further than iPhone, even though Android has more than 50% market share globally, and iPhone isn't ever expected to break much above 15-20% market share.</p> <p>Part of that is because iPhone and especially iPad shoppers currently tend to be worth more than Android shoppers, but also because it has been easier to design apps for iOS. This tends to be a self-fulfilling (self-defeating) prophecy, of course. Only have an iOS app, and only iOS customers will shop with you. There is an awfully long tail of customers out there.</p> <p>For example, one of the great mobile commerce businesses, Amazon, not only has a mobile-optimised website, but also apps for Apple, Android and even BlackBerry and Windows Phone, all of which are completely integrated at the back end. Put something in your basket in the app, and it's there on the mobile site. Look at something else, and that influences your \"recommended for you\" window on the desktop site. All of this gives the retailer huge reach among mobile shoppers and greatly improved user experience, leading to reassurance and increased propensity to shop.</p> <p>Ultimately, UKplc needs to think \"mobile now\" not \"mobile tomorrow\". Let's not get left behind. There is a real opportunity right now for travel/retail brands to lead the charge to a mobile-enabled economy as a positive driver to economic turnaround.</p> <p>And, once the underlying services are optimised, then brands can begin to get really creative with their advertising within this environment.</p> <p>As the ubiquitous Mary Meeker has said: \"Some brands will win big with mobile.

  "<p>If it were possible to solve climate change overnight through new technologies, the strict regulation of high-polluting industries or a binding political agreement that all the world's countries signed up to, wouldn't that make more sense than focusing on everyday attitudes and behaviour?</p> <p>The problem, of course, is that there is no magic low-carbon wand, but if there was it would be waved by a person as susceptible to the quirks, biases, and pitfalls of human judgement as the rest of us. So although it is comforting to draw sharp distinctions between politics, technologies and individuals, the reality is that human behaviour underpins it all. And this means that promoting sustainable behaviour in the most effective way is an absolutely critical part of society's response to climate change.</p> <p>At first, it was assumed that once people knew how environmentally damaging their actions were, they'd soon start making changes. Unfortunately, sustainable behaviour campaigns require more than just a clever campaign slogan and clear facts to succeed. Many sustainability initiatives over the past 20 years have targeted low-hanging fruit \u2013 so-called \"simple and painless\" behaviour changes like unplugging phone chargers, switching to energy-saving light-bulbs, or re-using plastic bags.</p> <p>But there is only limited evidence that starting with simple and painless changes is the best way of catalysing further changes \u2013 and there is a risk that people will feel they have already done their bit.</p> <p>So what should we be doing instead? First and foremost, individuals \u2013 and individual behaviours \u2013 cannot be separated from their social context. We act according to our personal values and priorities and in line with the social norms of our peer group. The key to promoting meaningful changes in sustainable behaviour \u2013 that do more than just pay lip service to tackling climate change \u2013 is to nurture and develop a sense of environmental identity or citizenship.</p> <p>When a person acts for self-interested reasons, that person will perceive themselves as someone who does things for their own benefit. They will only engage in further sustainable behaviours if there is something in it for them \u2013 so as soon as the 'sweeteners' dry up, so will their interest in sustainability. But if people begin to think of themselves as someone who does things for the environment, the chance that they will engage in other sustainable behaviours is much higher.</p> <p>It may not always be the quickest way of promoting a specific sustainable behaviour, but ultimately people can figure out for themselves whether something is in their own interest or not. The job of a sustainable behaviour practitioner is to help them see the bigger picture, and make the arguments about sustainability that an appeal to their wallet cannot do.</p> <p>A huge amount of everyday energy use is embedded in habitual behaviours. The problem is that something seemingly straightforward like getting the bus to work is actually made up of lots of smaller (habitual) decisions, for example leaving home earlier or showering the night before to save time, all of which can derail even the best intentions. Research on how habits form (and how they change), shows that breaking habitual behaviours down into detailed \"if/then\" style plans is one way to break bad habits and create more sustainable ones.</p> <p>But even the best-designed campaign to promote sustainable behaviour is limited in its scope if it fails to link everyday behaviours to the wider challenges of sustainability. Most people do not have a social network with sustainability at its core, but working to develop a group \u2013 rather than individual \u2013 sense of environmental responsibility and identity should be at the heart of any sustainability campaign.</p> <p>Similarly, for those who are trying to promote sustainable behaviour in the workplace, then there is an obvious place that most employees would look to for leadership: their employer. Changes in personal behaviours among workers can catalyse further changes from an employer because the argument that \"we've done our bit \u2013 now you do yours\" is a powerful one.</p> <p>Cultivating reciprocal links like these \u2013 between staff and employer, or between members of a social network \u2013 is one of the ways to ensure that promoting sustainable behaviour isn't detached from the politics of sustainability. How people act says something about their underlying values, the priorities they hold, and the type of world they want to live in.</p> <p>It may have become a tired old clich\u00e9, but being the change you want to see still sends out an important message. If done right, promoting sustainable behaviour can mean so much more than a clever slogan or an appeal for people to do their bit \u2013 it can be a political act in itself.</p> <p><em>Adam Corner is a researcher and writer whose work focuses on the psychology of communicating climate change.

  "<p>They're calling you \"the Scorsese of Lagos\" \u2013 no pressure then. That's what the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/magazine/nollywood-movies.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0) on Nigerian director Kunle Afolayan (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1875051/\" title=\"\">New York Times</a> recently headlined its piece, and Kunle Afolayan's ambitions to shake up the industry now known (more great expectations) as Nollywood. With three films under his belt since he started directing in 2005 \u2013 which, by frantic west-African standards, makes him more the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/stanleykubrick\" title=\"\">Kubrick</a> of Lagos \u2013 the 38-year-old has become a byword for elevated quality: shooting on 35mm, releasing in cinemas, trying to improve on horribly stilted Nollywood formulas that seem to place more emphasis on gaudy soft furnishings than on dialogue and camerawork.</p> <p>Actually, Afolayan would prefer it if you called him the Mel Gibson of Lagos. \"I always show <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2007/jan/05/actionandadventure.drama\" title=\"\">Apocalypto</a> to my crew, because of the language thing. I say to them: 'You don't necessarily have to shoot your film in English for it to be good. You can do Swahili, you can do any language, you can even do no language at all.'\" Gibson's not an obvious renaissance-man idol \u2013 but crossing boundaries, having international aspirations, is the path forward for Afolayan and what is becoming known as the New Nollywood. The old Nollywood had no time for film festivals. When I speak to the director, he's just touched down in Amsterdam for the <a href=\"http://africainthepicture.nl/en/en-1\" title=\"\">Africa in the Picture</a> jamboree, where he is shopping his comedy drama <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC_un9NgnG0\" title=\"\">Phone Swap</a>. Next up is London, for the <a href=\"http://www.filmafrica.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Film Africa festival</a>.</p> <p>\"I'm not saying it's the perfect film. I'm not saying it's the best thing that's ever happened to Nollywood. But it's totally different to what everyone else has done,\" Afolayan says of Phone Swap. It goes without saying that it's shot on film \u2013 a must for any hope of international distribution. And it has what sounds like the sort of sparky commercial premise that will give it high-concept traction beyond Nigerian borders: a country girl and a Lagos businessman fall in love in absentia after they pick up each other's BlackBerrys at the airport. Afolayan says he tried to steer clear of the overripe visual humour and slapstick that has dogged traditional Nollywood comedy.</p> <p>Phone Swap is a departure for Afolayan, as well as the industry. His first two movies, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB9iol0G2sM\" title=\"\">Irapada</a> (Redemption) and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPa9aRwdzKs\" title=\"\">Araromire</a> (The Figurine), were self-originated stories rooted in juju, the supernatural folklore tales Naija audiences never tire of. But he had to pitch for Phone Swap at an advertising agency, who were taking proposals on behalf of Samsung, who saw a branded Nigerian feature as a piece of potentially hot marketing in the last half of the noughties, when Nollywood was really hitting the global consciousness. Samsung later dropped out, but Afolayan, who won the pitch, went ahead with other corporate sponsors, most importantly BlackBerry. His various \"partners\" provided about 40% of the $500,000 budget; the rest came from his bank loans and his own pocket.</p> <p>Afolayan has few of the artistic hangups about taking corporate money that exist in the west \u2013 which isn't surprising when money is so difficult to raise and to recoup. New Nollywood budgets, driven by well-to-do production values, are beginning to creep beyond $500,000, but the lack of cinema screens in Nigeria (there are currently 10 mainstream cinemas) makes good returns far from certain. The Figurine only took about two-thirds of its budget back. Mahmood Ali-Balogun's recent marital drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/aug/21/why-nigeria-film-cant-square-up-hollywood\" title=\"\">Tango with Me</a>, also earmarked as a possible international breakout, failed to break even too. In fact, it's rare for any local film to take more than $200,000, according a <a href=\"http://blogs.indiewire.com/sydneylevine/the_myth_of_nollywood_and_the_rise_of_nigerian_cinema\" title=\"\">report compiled for Unesco by Nollywood expert Rob Aft</a>.</p> <p>There's an ingrained perception in Nigeria that anything other than the traditional Nollywood model \u2013 no-frills budgets between $15,000 and $75,000, and a smash-and-grab 14-day distribution window on VCD \u2013 is doomed to failure. That conservatism, most entrenched in the producing guilds who form Nollywood's power base, is what Afolayan is aiming to overcome. Ten more cinemas are on the way, and he thinks that will be enough to make New Nollywood-level budgets viable. \"I'd say we are pretty close. Even if your budget is $1m, you should be able to recoup it in the country. Because we have a huge market, and they know what they want, and when they see it, they go for it.\"</p> <p>He reckons The Figurine \u2013 which has some bursts of cinematic flair that suggest its director may indeed have been scrutinising Mel of the Jungle \u2013 made other producers take notice. Evidence suggests that Nollywood's turnover has dropped by at least 50% over the last couple of years \u2013 perhaps a sign that the days of profligate output are ending. Phone Swap, released in Nigeria in March, has made 80% of its costs back, with DVD and foreign releases still to come; another message to Nollywood that quality pays.</p> <p>Afolayan's reforms are motivated by childhood memories of a golden age: he is the seventh of the 25 children of Adeyemi \"Love\" Afolayan, a postwar theatre and cinema impresario who had 10 wives and died in 1996. Afolayan Jr grew up accompanying his father on \"carnivalesque\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8t8Ap5L0e8\" title=\"\">1970s film shoots</a> that often featured thousands of extras and lasted two or three months. \"I grew up seeing how film was properly done,\" he says. \"I had no idea what film-making was all about, but I saw the commitment from actors, I saw the commitment from crew.\" But the infant Nigerian film industry collapsed due to the lack of a feasible economic model, and didn't recover until the mid-1990s, when cheap video technology gave rise to Nollywood.</p> <p>The director trained as a banker, but got into the film business in 2005, initially as an actor. Amid the Nollywood mania, resisting the urge to direct wasn't easy. \"I wanted to stop complaining about what people did: let me see what I can make out of it. What you can do to start out is to capitalise on what people are not doing right. No matter how little it is, even it's just one step ahead.\"</p> <p>Nollywood could be about to take a giant step ahead, thanks to that recollection of the glory days. Afolayan is aiming to shoot October 1st, a serial killer movie set in 1960 against the backdrop of <a href=\"http://www.punchng.com/news/independence-day-speech-1960-nigeria-stands-upon-firm-foundations-balewa/\" title=\"\">Nigerian independence</a>, in February, but he is trying to secure a foreign co-producer outside the country first, to better his international chances. \"It is difficult to get a mainstream distribution deal, no matter how fantastic your film is, because it's a cartel, it's a clique,\" he says, \"If you don't belong, it's tough.\"</p> <p>His battle to set an economic precedent for Nollywood phase II could be as important as anything he puts up on the screen itself \u2013 and with his background in finance, he's well placed to achieve his goal. Werner Herzog once said that the <a href=\"http://www.bu.edu/arion/on-the-absolute-the-sublime-and-ecstatic-truth/\" title=\"\">ecstatic truth</a> \u2013 the poet's kind \u2013 trumps the accountant's truth.

  "<p>Why does it seem the 2012-13 NBA Season has begun ridiculously early? Oh that's right, there was that lockout last year that almost sabotaged the entire season and ensured that games didn't begin until Christmas. This year, the NBA is operating right on schedule, with the regular season beginning Tuesday 30 October. With no labor strife, we have a full slate of basketball goodness ahead.</p> <p>We've already had a full month of preseason. Everybody has been watching <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjf2phkUQZc\">Nate Robinson hitting game-winners</a> and other such deeply meaningful heroics, right? That's way more exciting than things like the MLB playoffs, the NFL and college football... </p> <p>Okay, maybe this NBA preseason hasn't quite gotten your attention, especially when compared to the entertaining run the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/olympics-2012-basketball\">USA Men's basketball team pulled off at the London Olympics</a>.</p> <p>For those who have had better things to do than focus on offseason drama and \"imaginary basketball\" (as I call the preseason), we present our NBA preview. We'll break down some of the main storylines for each team, a guide to what has happened since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/22/miami-heat-oklahoma-city-thunder-live-game-5\">the Miami Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals</a>. For instance, did you know that LeBron James and Kevin Durant are good at basketball? It's true! Where else will you get cutting-edge analysis like that? </p> <p>(Next up: An in-depth analysis of how the NBA's <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/10/17/3517348/nba-basketball-pregame-handshake-hugs\">crackdown on lengthy handshakes</a> will alter the potential playoff landscape.)</p> <h2><strong>Eastern Conference</strong></h2> <h2>Atlantic</h2> <p><strong>1 Boston Celtics</strong>: </p> <p>The New Big Three era in Boston is officially over. Ray Allen, upset over being replaced by Avery Bradley (aka <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/mar/29/trayvon-martin-miami-heat-donald-sterling\">\"My Guy\"</a>), accepted a bench role with the rival Miami Heat despite the fact that the Celtics offered him more money in the offseason. This makes for potentially great drama, especially now that <a href=\"http://www.slamonline.com/online/nba/2012/10/ray-allen-says-beef-with-rajon-rondo-began-in-2009/\">he and his former teammates are already jawing</a>, but it distracts from the very real possibility that this Celtics team could be just as good as they were last year, even if only Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett remain of the championship-winning trio.</p> <p>That seems a bit strange, of course, considering that they are down a Hall-of-Famer and an already almost ancient team has gotten a full season older, but stick with us. Once Avery Bradley is healthy he could have a good shot at replacing Ray Allen's production. Jeff Green, a year removed from heart surgery, should be nearly as healthy as his new contract. Jason Terry and Courtney Lee should be solid contributors and the absence of the back-to-back games of last year's condensed schedule might allow the older players to save their legs a bit. This was a team that needed just one more win \u2013 if against a Heat team featuring LeBron James in Berserker Mode \u2013 to advance to the finals.</p> <p>If the Celtics are one win better it will be because Rajon Rondo has finally taken that next step and become the elite player he has shown flashes of being. It seems every year that the take on the C's is \"they need Rondo to step up\", but this year it's not just a thing experts say, it's an absolute imperative for an aging team without the best three-point shooter of all time. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/boston/nba/story/_/id/8510892/rajon-rondo-steps-shadows-boston-celtics-leader\">Rondo is going to need to be a leader</a>, he's going to have to be a more offensive threat and he's going to have to cut down on his on-court mental lapses. With the New Big Three era over, it's officially Rajon Rondo's team and its fortunes rest with him.</p> <p><strong>2 Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p> <p>The dust settled on the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8256377/dwight-howard-traded-los-angeles-lakers\">Dwight Howard Trade</a>, and somehow the Philadelphia 76ers ended up with Andrew Bynum. It sounds like a deal to get one of the last true centers in the game until you realize that they also lost Andre Iguodala in the transaction \u2013 he's gone to the Denver Nuggets. The downside to Bynum is that he is injury prone, has a reputation of having motivation problems and is known to make dumb comments. The good news is that Philadelphia fans are known to be incredibly patient with such players. </p> <p>The 76ers were good enough last year to make it to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, where they played the Celtics in what may have been <a href=\"http://nbagrapevine.com/teams/east/atlantic/boston/boston-celtics-vs-the-philadelphia-76ers-bring-the-ugly/\">one of the most plodding seven-game series in modern NBA postseason history</a>. (This is coming from a writer who had rooting interest in the whole thing, mind you.) Are they a better team now, considering they basically swapped Iguodala with Bynum, amnestied Elton Brand and added Kwame Brown? Well they just needed one more postseason win to make it to the Eastern Conference Finals, so the answer is a solid \"maybe\".</p> <p>It depends on whether or not Bynum flourishes. He did have the best season of his career last year (including a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vh_mVeG7WA\">playoff triple-double </a>over the Nuggets) despite conflicts with Lakers coach Mike Brown and his premature statement that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z729HvMq9AU\">\"closeout games are easy\"</a>. If he remains healthy and keeps his head straight then sure, but does anyone want to take bets on Bynum remaining healthy? If he isn't, Michael Vick will have some company as the biggest target on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FakeWIPCaller\">Philadelphia sports radio</a>.</p> <p><strong>3 New York Knicks</strong></p> <p>Status: officially sane again. Yes, Linsanity no longer reigns in New York, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/02/jeremy-lin-linsanity-houston-rockets-new-york-knicks\">Jeremy Lin has gone to the Houston Rockets</a> \u2013 the Knicks management* did not bother to match Houston's offer. Don't worry Knicks fans, New York has made some great signings to make up for the loss of what was the best thing to happen to the franchise in years. For instance, they signed the now-ironically named Jason Kidd and <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/knicks/index.ssf/2012/10/knicks_links_rasheed_wallaces.html\">Rasheed Wallace</a>. Hey wait, don't turn your attention to Brooklyn just yet.</p> <p>We know that doesn't really sound very promising. Don't worry, all it will take for the Knicks to pass the first round of the playoffs for the first time in years is for Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire to learn how to play with each other. That seems simple enough, right? The catch is that the growing consensus is that Stoudemire had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/may/03/amare-stoudemire-fire-extinguisher-paul-pierce-tebows\">more chemistry with the fire extinguisher that broke his hand</a> last postseason than 'Melo. Not that it will matter in the beginning of the year, as Stoudemire will be out with a knee cyst.</p> <p>More worrisome might be the health of Tyson Chandler, the reigning defensive player of the year (which somehow translates to only <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/blog/new-york/knicks/post/_/id/19852/tyson-named-to-nbas-all-defensive-second-team\">second-team defensive all-star</a> in NBA math), who was last seen <a href=\"http://lindyssports.com/nba/new-york-knicks/article/headline/knicks-tyson-chandler-injures-knee-leaves-arena-on-crutches/48533\">leaving a preseason game on crutches</a>. If Chandler is healthy, that gives New York a chance: even if Anthony and Stoudemire don't mesh, they're still going to score a bunch of points. As long as they get something out of the point guard position, the Knicks should get into the postseason and might have a chance to take it to the next level. Mind you: that next level might just mean getting bounced in the second round of the playoffs.</p> <p><em>* Note: There is a a school of thought that \"Knicks management\" is, in fact, an oxymoron. Also: Rasheed Wallace, Kwame Brown and <a href=\"http://freedarko.blogspot.com/\">Darko Milicic</a> (currently with Boston) are now all in the same division, which is a score for people whose jobs involve making basketball jokes.</em></p> <p><strong>4 Brooklyn Nets</strong></p> <p>Forget Dwight Howard \u2013 the biggest trade of the offseason occurred when the New Jersey Nets traded states. Yes, the Nets said goodbye New Jersey and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23hellobrooklyn\">#helloBrooklyn</a>, and that was just the start of their identity change. Owner Mikhail Prokhorov's team bears only a little resemblance to the old New Jersey team. After bowing out of the Dwight Howard sweepstakes by re-signing oft-hurt center Brook Lopez \u2013 and aren't they all oft-hurt these days \u2013 the Nets decided to build around a resigned Deron Williams and to trade for Joe Johnson and his ridiculous contract. Like that movie in which Ryan Reynolds played Green Lantern, Johnson was ill-suited for the savior role with the Atlanta Hawks. Although vastly overpaid as Williams's sidekick, he still makes the perfect second option for the new-look Nets.</p> <p>The Nets aren't really worried about money right now \u2013 they're more concerned about gaining buzz. On that front, they have not only moved to a hip new location, they even have pop-culture icons! Not only is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz_-VaTHpc8\">Jay-Z </a>a part-owner (Okay, he owns like a millionth of the team, but that's something), but the team also features former \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" cast member Kris Humphries. Okay, he's not as popular as Jay-Z \u2013 in fact he's the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/nba-player-kris-humphries-booed-nets-game-divorce/story?id=15214316\">Most Hated Man In the NBA</a> \u2013 but there's almost no such thing as bad publicity for a team trying to position itself as the new, big deal in Brooklyn.</p> <p>Ultimately, the Nets have enough novelty, talent and name recognition to make their debut season a hit as far as getting attention goes. What they don't have is a roster constructed to make them a serious threat to reach the NBA Finals or<a href=\"http://www.hoopsworld.com/brooklyn-nets-team-salary/\"> the cap space</a> to ensure that they will have such a team in the near future. In other words, the Nets are no longer in New Jersey but, well, they're still the Nets.</p> <p><strong>5 Toronto Raptors</strong></p> <p>The good news for the Raptors is that they're still the best basketball team in Canada and the best sports franchise whose name was inspired by Jurassic Park. The other good news is that they should be a little bit better this season, especially with the addition of Kyle Lowry, formerly of the Houston Rockets. The young point guard's presence promises that the Raptors will be a more interesting team to watch than you might expect and they could even flirt with the eighth seed in the East, but he's not enough to make locals less depressed about the hockey lockout.</p> <p>The most Raptors thing in Raptors history happened during this offseason, by the way, when they signed shooting guard Landry Fields to a $20m, three-year deal as part of <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/raptors-offer-landry-fields-three-20-million-deal-043335409--nba.html\">a complicated gambit </a>to woo point guard Steve Nash. You can't blame the Raptors for wanting to have the best Canadian basketball player ever on their team, but Nash ended up with the Lakers. So now one of their highest-paid players is somebody they didn't even really want. They are almost lovable, these Raptors.</p> <h2><strong>Central </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Indiana Pacers</strong></p> <p>The Indiana Pacers had a lot of success last year, but there's some thought that they could come back to Earth. Last season's team, who were something of a surprise, featured such medium names as Danny Granger, Paul George and David West. In fact, the Pacers might be second only to the Oakland A's in baseball as far as contending pro-teams featuring anonymous-sounding players. One big key to their success was Roy Hibbert, who continues to quietly be one of the few true centers left in the game (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c4hY8mQM6Y\">and the only worthwhile Gangnam Style parodist out there</a>).</p> <p>With all this success, the one obstacle that could prevent the Pacers from building on last year's success would be their health. To quote Beckley Mason in ESPN: The Magazine (so named as not to be confused with ESPN: The Towel Holder or ESPN: The Gluten-Free Candy Bar): \"Paul George, David West, Granger, Darren Collison and Roy Hibbert played 1,000 minutes together \u2013 or 253 more than any other NBA teammates spent as a unit\". That's a great thing to happen, but it's not something Indiana can realistically expect to happen in back to back seasons.</p> <p>A nice story for the Pacers might be the addition of Gerald Green, the second-biggest story about a D-League washout becoming a solid contributor. Green didn't have a Jeremy Lin sized impact \u2013 who else could \u2013 but he proved to be a solid pro-level contributor for the New Jersey Nets and he was responsible for the No1 non-Blake Griffin <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LipvtaK41mw&amp;feature=fvst\">Dunk of the Year</a>. So, if the Pacers' luck turns and they start suffering a lot more injuries, there's a feelgood story to follow. A feelgood story with dunks.</p> <p><strong>2 Chicago Bulls<br></strong><br>When will Derrick Rose return? Okay, there are other questions to ask about the Chicago Bulls, but that's the key one, isn't it? The other key questions are: When he returns this season (<em>if</em> he returns this season) what will the Bulls be playing for? Will he be anything approximating the Derrick Rose of old? Will he ever be as good as he was before he tore his ACL? For most of the season, Rose will be the post-structuralist critic's dream, the presence notable for its absence.</p> <p>You know, like Charlie in Charlie's Angels. <a href=\"http://chicagoist.com/2012/09/13/derrick_rose_unveils_new_shoes_gets.php\">Except with really cool shoes</a>.</p> <p>So, assuming that Rose is out for most of the season, and won't fully be himself when he does return, head coach Tom Thibodeau will have an opportunity to live up to his budding reputation as a basketball genius. Luckily, the Bulls are gifted with a few pretty great players, most notably Luol Deng and Joakim Noah. Still, the Bulls are going to be much farther from the championship this year than they were last year before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/29/derrick-rose-injury-chicago-bulls-acl\">the ACL Injury That Changed Everything</a>. Chicago could have been the team to knock off LeBron James and the Miami Heat? Now, now it's a team whose championship hopes are resting on Rose's uncertain legs.</p> <p><strong>3 Milwaukee Bucks</strong></p> <p>The Bucks finally decided that the Andrew Bogut roller coaster had to come to an end, mostly because that ride was always shut down for repairs. So Milwaukee traded their oft-injured center (along with Stephen Jackson) to the Golden State Warriors for the talented but beyond erratic Monta Ellis. Ellis will be a lock to bring a bit of Warriors basketball to the Bucks: lots of offense, little defense and a lot of on-court ridiculousness, both good and bad, that will ensure his name is continually trending on Twitter (<a href=\"http://bayarea.sbnation.com/golden-state-warriors/2011/1/12/1932331/monte-ellis-not-monta-ellis-twitter-trend\">albeit misspelled as Monte</a>).</p> <p>Ellis joins Brandon Jennings as the core of the Bucks, which is a fairly underwhelming duo by any standard. This is probably why the folks at the indispensable basketball blog \"<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/ball-don-t-lie-2012-13-nba-season-135759750--nba.html\">Ball Don't Lie</a>\" have noted that the Bucks are getting just <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/bucks/schedule/\">one nationally televised game</a> this season. That's the kind of television schedule that a .500 team without any name players gets and, well, that's who these Bucks are. </p> <p><strong>4 Cleveland Cavaliers</strong></p> <p>On the heels of The Decision, spurned Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert wrote a message (<a href=\"http://www.geekosystem.com/dan-gilbert-comic-sans/\">in Comic Sans, no less,</a>) that the Cavs would win a title before departed forward LeBron James did. This prediction, to say the least, seems rather unlikely to come to pass without some sort of loophole involving either time travel or the multiple-worlds theory of the universe. The Heat won it all a few months ago, the Cavaliers are still years away from the postseason.</p> <p>The Cavaliers are again all about one player \u2013 this time around it's sophomore guard Kyrie Irving who isn't LeBron but did almost single-handedly revive Cleveland's interest in hoops last season. Kyrie Irving, absolutely the best basketball player to have a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHXgHjDOxUM\">Mister Mister song named after him</a>, was an absolute beast last year and if he's able to make a second-year jump the Cavs could be at least a spoiler in the East. The Cavs got some help for Irving, drafting Dion Waiters to be his wingman. Waiters was drafted too high, probably, but the Cavs obviously think that Irving and Waiters will work together well. They won't work well enough to make the Comic Sans Guarantee look any less ridiculous, but well enough to get them knocking on the doors of respectability.</p> <p><strong>5 Detroit Pistons</strong></p> <p>It's a good thing the Detroit Tigers are in the World Series, because my stars is Detroit not going to have much fun watching its basketball team this season. Well Okay, big man Greg Monroe's development should be fun to watch, not to mention watching Andre Drummond (who fell to No8 in the draft) play his rookie year. Of course, there's the concert that the Pistons have not committed themselves to playing Drummond significant minutes and would rather play also-rans and never-will-be's instead. </p> <p>The other thing that Detroit has is that, well... um, this is awkward. There's no way to spin this one, folks: the era of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZcqM294c7E\">Detroit Bad Boys</a> is as over as the era of saying \"bad as in good\". This season, Detroit will just be bad.</p> <h2><strong>Southeast </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Miami Heat</strong></p> <p>So, did the Heat do anything interesting last year?</p> <p>The strangest thing happened to the Heat on their way to their first post-Decision championship: they almost became, if not likable, at least difficult to hate too too much. LeBron James's \"inability to come through in the clutch\" was dissected to the point where former haters were rooting for him to finally win a ring, just to quiet the Skip Baylesses of the world. Dwyane Wade was clearly playing so injured that it seemed legitimate to speculate that years of playing the game hard were catching up with him for good. Chris Bosh was trying to return, probably too early, from an abdominal injury and dealing with nonstop ridicule that painted him as an effeminate third wheel. Head coach Erik Spoelstra seemed to be just holding a clipboard until the inevitable return of Pat Riley, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqpjlYCS85g\">Mario Chalmers was a Saturday Night Live punchline</a> and the bench was mostly bargain-basement scrubs and completely broken three-point shooters.</p> <p>Luckily, the Miami Heat are now NBA champions, so we can all go back to hating them. Despite getting some key plays from some of their bench guys during the Finals, most notably when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kq8JClcZAFM\">Mike Miller went three-pointer crazy</a> in the season-clinching Game 5, Miami upgraded the bench by bringing in Boston's Ray Allen and New Orleans's Rashard Lewis. Everybody knows their roles now, mainly because the last few months have established that this is very much LeBron James's team. </p> <p>King James, and we can call him that now, is the reigning regular-season MVP, was the Finals MVP and just got through leading Team USA through the London Olympics. Having won an MVP trophy, a championship ring and a gold medal, James has enough hardware now to open a Home Depot. He's pretty much the best basketball player in the known universe, a dominant force even in the fourth quarters of games and seems as unstoppable as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZChSzoYy8D8\">Mike Tyson in the old Nintendo Punch Out game</a>. He is scary good right now, and so is his team.</p> <p>The question isn't whether or not the Heat are the Goliath of the Eastern Conference. No, the question is whether or not there are any Davids that could prevent them from reaching the Finals for the third straight year. Don't bet on it.</p> <p><strong>2 Atlanta Hawks</strong></p> <p>The best news for the Atlanta Hawks is that they got rid of Joe Johnson and his absolutely ridiculous contract, pawning it off on the mad-with-cash Brooklyn Nets. It says something about how finance-savvy modern sports fans are that a perennial playoff team could trade away its best and most high-profile player and that the fan response would be almost universal praise. Or maybe the Joe Johnson contract was just so bad that it was impossible to defend.</p> <p>Beyond that addition by subtraction, and the wise acquisition of Lou Williams (formerly of the 76ers) as a cheap Johnson replacement, the best thing to happen for the Hawks is that they could get (knock on wood) a full season of a healthy Al Horford. Horford returned to the lineup last postseason and <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/horford-hawks-stay-alive-beat-celtics-87-86-091215888.html\">immediately made an impact in their series against the Celtics</a>. The big-man duo of Horford and Josh Smith will make the Hawks a dangerous team during the regular season.</p> <p>That's the regular season though \u2013 could this Atlanta Hawks team get deep in the playoffs? The one thing not in their favor is that they're a pro sports team in Atlanta \u2013 just ask Bobby Cox or Matt Ryan how difficult that is in that city. No wonder <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/20526465/report-tracy-mcgrady-signs-one-year-contract-with-qingdao-in-china\">they exiled first-round elimination magnet Tracy McGrady to China</a>. There's enough bad juju working against them.</p> <p><strong>3 Washington Wizards</strong></p> <p>There was a brief spell of happiness in the Washington DC era, a possibility of rebirth highlighted by both Sports Illustrated and ESPN - The Magazine publishing articles focusing on the area. (Okay, SI made them share time with Baltimore, but still.) What happened then? Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III got injured, the Washington Nationals suffered a 9th-inning collapse in the fifth game of the National League Division Series and, most notably for our purposes, Washington Wizards guard John Wall <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wizards-insider/wp/2012/09/29/john-walls-injury-forces-wizards-to-regroup/\">suffered a knee injury</a> that ensured he wouldn't be returning until November.</p> <p>Many recent Wizards moves have just been about dumping the malcontent and the mistake-prone (Gilbert Arenas, JaVale McGee, Nick Young), in the hopes of building around the developing Wall. Washington's initial dilemma was figuring out what kind of team can you build around Wall, but that concern has morphed into whether or not Wall is the kind of player you <em>can</em> build around. In any case, Wall's absence gives the Wizards no choice but to play players like Nene, Trevor Ariza and third-round draft pick Bradley Beal and see what else they have. Who knows, maybe some currently unknown player will step up like Jeremy Lin did last year and make fans almost dread Wall's return to the lineup. It's far more likely, however, that Washington fans will do everything short of sacrificing small animals in a desperate attempt to hasten his return.</p> <p><strong>4 Orlando Magic</strong></p> <p>Okay, the most important things you need to know about the Orlando Magic are that they no longer have center Dwight Howard and that they're going to be terrible this year and for a very long time to come. In a desperate attempt to keep their star player, his bags already packed, the Magic fired head coach Stan Van Gundy and even made overtures to hire <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/could-shaquille-o-neal-orlando-gm-story-come-140847691.html\">Shaquille O'Neal as GM</a>. These last-minute gestures failed to sway Basketball Hamlet, so the Magic sent him to the Lakers in a trade that also involved the Nuggets and the 76ers.</p> <p>What was the haul of goodies that the Magic got for trading away the best center in the league? The Magic got Arron Affalo, Al Harrington, Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless, Josh McRoberts, Christian Eyenga and five protected draft picks (three first-rounders and two second-rounders) from the other three teams. What does that mean for Orlando? Who knows. Every other team received proven commodities; the Magic got the basketball talent equivalent of \"what's behind door No3\". They traded their unhappy franchise player, the center who made their team relevant again, for a handful of... well... magic beans. Somewhere Shaq is laughing, and by somewhere I mean \"inexplicably on television still\".</p> <p><strong>5 Charlotte Bobcats</strong></p> <p>The Charlotte Bobcats had the worst season in NBA history last year, and for their efforts they didn't get even get the first pick in the NBA Draft (ie, they missed out on Anthony Davis). So, chances are that this season has to be a little bit better. Owner Michael Jordan has promised to be less hands-off \u2013 I guess his highly competitive nature has realized that a <a href=\"http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/04/26/is-the-best-player-ever-michael-jordan-also-the-worst-gm-ever/\">Worst Owner In NBA History award</a> clashed with his status as Greatest Basketball Player Ever.</p> <p>Well, the Bobcats did get Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the second pick and they did pick up a veteran free agent in the offseason. Since I don't know what Ben Gordon will provide, I'll say what teams say whenever they pick up older players for no reason. Gordon will provide \"veteran leadership\". Listen, the Bobcats won't have the worst season in basketball history again. Maybe they will catch a break and won't even be the worst team in the league. Dream big, Charlotte. Dream big.</p> <p><strong>Prediction:<br>Eastern Conference Finals: Miami Heat OVER Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p> <p>I'm not entirely sold on the 76ers but I just don't see the Celtics returning to the conference finals. Philadelphia seems like the team most likely to jump past them. Keep in mind I could have picked the Celtics, the Pacers, the Hawks or a revived, Derrick Rose-led Bulls team here and it would have made no difference. The Heat are going to win the Eastern Conference.</p> <h2><strong>Western Conference</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Northwest</strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Oklahoma City Thunder</strong></p> <p>Their last few games they played didn't turn out as they planned, but the former Seattle Supersonics had their best year ever. The scary part? They could be even better this year. Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook spent their summer playing together on Team USA at the London Olympics. Plus, Serge Ibaka played for Spain and hey, with Dwight Howard in the Western Conference, Kendrick Perkins is now actually useful, considering his history of neutralizing the most dominant center in the game. (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/jun/16/miami-heat-lebron-james-russell-westbrook-fashion\">Oh yes, this does mean a return of Nick Collison, Undercover Baller</a>.)</p> <p>My draft summary of the Thunder's offseason discussed whether or not the Thunder could be a potential new dynasty if they managed to keep hold of James Harden. Well that changed on Saturday, after contract extension talks broke down, the Oklahoma City Thunder <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8562868/oklahoma-city-thunder-trade-james-harden-houston-rockets\">traded James Harden, their third best player and Sixth Man of the Year to the Houston Rockets</a>. The Thunder sent Harden, along with Cole Aldrich, Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward, to the Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, two first-round draft picks and a second rounder. The Thunder, as any major Trail Blazers fan would tell you, have done well with their draft picks in the past, and considering that Harden was likely to get paid more than he was worth (although not in comparison with, say, a Kendrick Perkins) the payroll flexibility may help them in the long run. Still, it's curious considering that this was a team that was just in the NBA Finals. It could be argued that, for this season at least, the Lakers were a bigger beneficiary of this trade than any of the teams involved</p> <p><strong>2 Denver Nuggets</strong></p> <p>The Dwight Howard Trade made the Lakers the favorites to win the West, but it also helped out a team that could be standing in their way. It didn't get as much press, but Andre Iguodala might have more impact on his new team than Howard on his. He's not a Proven Center, that near-mythical beast, like Howard or Andrew Bynum, but Iguodala is a great all-around player, someone who managed to be an underrated Olympic champion. He's the exact right guy to lead a Nuggets team that many experts think is just behind the Thunder and the Lakers in the West.</p> <p>The Nuggets, and head coach the Venerable George Karl, hope that Iguodala helps out with another one more of their more recent acquisitions, JaVale McGee. Even without Iguodala, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgSYA3Gb7oI\">the Human Lowlight Reel</a> had an incredible postseason run where he almost single-handedly brought down the Lakers. If the Nuggets can get the most out of the talented seven-footer, meaning less saluting and fewer bone-headed plays, then they might have the core of an amazing team here, even a team that could reach the finals, with a little luck.</p> <p><strong>3 Utah Jazz</strong></p> <p>The Utah Jazz, believe it or not, went to the playoffs last year. You can look it up on the internet, although I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to check <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com\">Snopes</a> first. The Jazz were the last team to get in the playoffs and the first team to get bounced. That result seems believable; the Jazz repeating those results this season also seems believable.</p> <p>What else is going on for this team? Well, Al Jefferson is an interesting player to watch \u2013 he's better than you think he is and he will be a solid rotation player on a major franchise sooner rather than later. The Jazz reacquired Mo Williams, pretty much exactly the platonic ideal of a Jazz player, as well as Randy Foye. It should be another decent season, but keep in mind that \"another decent season\" is the ceiling for this franchise as currently constituted. Maybe they could try to increase their future playoff chances, or at least public visibility, by finally dumping the Jazz monicker and getting a more appropriate name.</p> <p><strong>4 Minnesota Timberwolves</strong></p> <p>The Timberwolves were supposed to be the Most Fun Team In Basketball this year, but instead an injury to Kevin Love has put a damper on their potential postseason success. Love is expected to be gone for six to eight weeks after he broke his hand <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5952947/kevin-love-broke-his-hand-while-doing-knuckle-pushups\">doing knuckle pushups</a>. No seriously, that's how he broke it.</p> <p>This wouldn't be such bad news if Minnesota's second best-player, Ricky Rubio, and his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es8dtZW4FnA\">reality-bending passing ability</a>, wasn't out with an ACL injury for good portion of the season. Together, they would have made the Timberwolves a serious playoff threat, especially with an improved supporting cast that includes a suddenly unretired Brandon Roy and Andrei Kirilenko. Now, <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/40102/what-kevin-loves-injury-means-for-the-timberwolves\">they're just another mediocre Western Conference team</a>.</p> <p>Oh, they do have Greg Stiemsma now, and Tommy Heinsohn said that <a href=\"http://www.rantsports.com/nba/2012/01/02/tommy-heinsohn-compares-greg-stiemsma-to-bill-russell/\">he was like Bill Russell</a>. Maybe not all is lost in Minnesota after all what with the... oops, sorry, my Stiemsma paragraph has just fouled out of the preview.</p> <p><strong>5 Portland Trail Blazers</strong></p> <p>The Trail Blazers had a good first half of the 2011-12 season before their season collapsed and they basically packed it in around the trade deadline. Don't expect Portland to make a huge jump this year, which seems set to be a water treading one of mere existence. There is maybe a sign or two that the franchise is about to change: the team officially parted ways with <a href=\"http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/7908766/a-rare-interview-former-no-1-overall-pick-greg-oden-injury-plagued-career\">oft-broken, near-tragic figure</a> Greg Oden, who not only has played very little but has acted as something of a symbol of Portland's missed opportunities.</p> <p>Now that the Trail Blazers are officially without Oden, as well as the un-retired Brandon Roy, they can try to find a new identity, theoretically with LaMarcus Aldrirdge at its core. Unfortunately, searching for a new identity makes a really great 1990s independent movie \u2013 not a thrilling basketball season.</p> <h2><strong>Pacific </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p> <p>The Lakers decided to stand pat this offseason, confident that their roster as currently assembled was good enough to challenge for a title. Then they remembered that they were the Lakers and made trades for Dwight Howard and Steve Nash while somehow managing to keep Pau Gasol. It felt like the Lakers won the Western Conference in the offseason.</p> <p>That's not where championships are won, however. The problem with the Lakers is that they have the kind of team that could collapse at any time. Kobe Bryant, as you may have heard, can be a bit of a ballhog and he's not getting any younger: some nights he's going to look like vintage Kobe and others nights he's going to look more like his dad Jellybean. Second-year head coach Mike Brown's control of the team is also in question. Kobe is basically in charge of the offense; Brown sometimes seems like merely the defensive coordinator. Brown had trouble dealing with the young Andrew Bynum last year, a detail that seems minor now but could be a prelude to trouble with the mercurial Howard. Nash should help team chemistry, that's what the (Formerly) Floppy Haired Canadian does, but his influence will be lessened if his bad back sidelines him. In what may be the most troubling news for team chemistry, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jpmoore/the-5-craziest-things-metta-world-peace-said-on-nb\">Metta World Peace still exists</a>. </p> <p>The fun part? Dwight Howard is a free agent after the end of this season, which means next year there's a chance that we might go through all of this again with Basketball Hamlet. If there's one surefire motivation, beyond winning a ring of course, for these Lakers to find their chemistry and find it fast, it's to ensure that Howard doesn't have any reason to pull his \"to be a Laker or not to be a Laker\" stunt. </p> <p>If the Lakers do all get along, and Howard plays the role of good soldier, they are going to be a very, very difficult team to defeat. This collection of All-Stars is unlikely to last very long, this is as \"win now\" a team as you could possibly build, but no one in purple and gold will care if they can grab another ring this year. Their biggest enemy may be themselves.</p> <p><strong>2 Los Angeles Clippers</strong></p> <p>The Clippers made a few moves that could provide dividends, moves that could help make them a true rival to their Staples Center roommates. With <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/10/18/3524556/chauncey-billups-injury-los-angeles-clippers\">Chauncey Billups out with an Achilles injury</a>, the Clippers have brought in 90s icon and former Sprite pitchman Grant Hill as their Designated Veteran Injury Risk. Also entering the fold? <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1156027/\">Lamar Odom-Kardashian</a>, back in Hollywood, the only city where he's ever really played to his ability level, after a disastrous Texan exile. </p> <p>But ultimately? Just like last year, it's going to be all about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMzJBSXfECE\">Lob City</a>, now that point guard Chris Paul and forward Blake Griffin have played a lockout-shortened season's worth of games together, the floor show might just get even more fun to watch. Paul-to-Griffin for the dunk is maybe the most fun combo play by two athletes since Tom Brady to Randy Moss for the touchdown. Assuming you're not on the opposite end of it.</p> <p>There are two major issues with the Clippers. First of all, Vinny del Negro managed to keep his job as head coach <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/20385003/clippers-vinny-del-negro-is-working-without-a-net\">(for now at least)</a>. The other issue is a tad longer-term, like Howard with the Lakers, Chris Paul is also free agent after the end of the year. If the Clippers start to lag behind in the West, will Paul want to remain as an afterthought in LA? Will his contract situation loom over the season? If so, that could be a disaster for Clippers owner Donald Sterling, not that many will shed tears for him.</p> <p><strong>3 Golden State Warriors</strong></p> <p>Last season, once again, the Golden State Warriors were the most fun bad team in basketball. The Warriors played their heavy-offense/little-defense/erratic-fundamentals game for most of the season, although they were less fun when they traded away the endearingly frustrating Monta Ellis towards the end of the season. In return for Ellis, the Warriors received Andrew Bogut, who may or may not be healed in time for the Mayan Apocalypse, and they still have Stephen Curry likewise. In a best-case scenario health-wise, they will just barely miss the playoffs, but they will miss them in a really fun manner. Like always.</p> <p>They also have Klay Thompson, who recently was the first-place vote getter in a GM survey about <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/news/2012-13-gm-survey/index.html?rss=true\">which player was most likely to have a breakout season</a>. I sorta think those dudes know what they're talking about. It's obvious by now that these previews are a tad bit \"glass half-full\" aren't they?</p> <p><strong>4 Phoenix Suns</strong></p> <p>The Suns just missed out on the playoffs last year, losing their spot to the Jazz who were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in less time than it took you to read this sentence. Considering that Utah never really had a chance, it would have been better for basketball had there been one last Steven Nash-era Suns/Spurs series, but it just wasn't to be. Nash, as expected, wanted to spend his last few years in the NBA with a contender, so Phoenix <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8130840/sources-steve-nash-headed-los-angeles-lakers-sign-trade-deal\">worked out a sign-a-trade with the Lakers</a>, sending the Canadian superstar to Los Angeles in exchange for draft picks. </p> <p>The Suns did acquire Michael Beasley \u2013 the former second-round draft pick best known for <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5818665/michael-beasley-has-not-yet-kicked-that-demon-weed\">his marijuana issues</a> \u2013 from the Timberwolves, and he might now be the Suns' marquee player. Obviously we're working on a very broad interpretation of the word \"marquee\", but I suppose somebody had to be. Beyond Beasley and the draft picks, the Suns' other major offsesason acquisition has been Jermaine O'Neal, a walking Walking Dead joke still going two or three years after his career was pronounced legally dead. Looking at this roster, can you really blame Nash for wanting to be on another team, even if that team ended up being the Lakers?</p> <p><strong>5 Sacramento Kings</strong></p> <p>Well, they're the Sacramento Kings for now at least. The Kings' owners, the Maloof family, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/wizards/sacramento-kings-set-for-another-uncertain-season-on-off-the-court/2012/10/24/8a45f04c-1df1-11e2-8817-41b9a7aaabc7_story.html\">have been having a tug-of-war with the city of Sacramento</a>, alternating between threatening to move the franchise and getting preliminary deals to stay in town for what seems like eternity. It all makes the relationship Dwight Howard had with the Orlando Magic look downright healthy. Be prepared for at least a half-dozen \"Kings close to deal to stay in Sacramento\" stories, followed by the exact same number of reports that they are heading somewhere else, presumably Anaheim or Seattle.</p> <p>Even beyond the owners, the Kings are a difficult franchise to root for as they are currently constituted, particularly because their best player, DeMarcus Cousins, continues to be rather immature and there isn't really a support system in place to ensure that he is necessarily going to grow up any time soon. It's the subject of easy jokes that the Maloofs' selling of the naming rights to their stadium has led to it being rebranded as <a href=\"http://www.theclassical.org/theclog/all-aboard-in-defense-of-sleep-train-arena-and-sleep-train-and-some-other-things\">Sleep Train Arena</a> but when was the last time a basketball arena's name ever doubled as a perfect description for the on-court product?</p> <h2><strong>Southwest </strong></h2> <p><strong>1 San Antonio Spurs</strong></p> <p>It feels like the San Antonio Spurs' playoff run, in which they won 20 straight games starting in the regular season and running through the postseason before the Thunder defeated them in the Western Conference Finals, was their last big hurrah. After all, the Spurs are all a year older now and it seems unlikely that they will get that deep into the playoffs again \u2013 certainly that undefeated span seems difficult to duplicate. But do you want to bet against the Spurs?</p> <p>For the Spurs to have a shot against the Lakers or the Thunder, point guard Tony Parker is going to have to have a repeat of last year's MVP-caliber season. It's strange to think of a Spurs team where Tim Duncan, the ageless wonder, isn't the team's key player, but the younger Parker (in Spurs terms) might be the most important player. Parker, after all, is just back from the London Olympics where he helped lead the French National team, so he's certain capable of taking more of a leadership role. </p> <p>At the very least, the expanded role of Parker is one of the reason that last year's San Antonio team was... actually fun to watch? Or at the very least not boring. The other reasons would be the other long time Spurs on the team: Manu Ginobili (the Best Sixth Man In NBA History) and Gregg Popovich (Hall of Fame coach). Wait, this season will be interesting? Wow, different times for this franchise right?</p> <p><strong>2 Memphis Grizzlies</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"Basketball blogging nation, I've hit the Memphis Grizzlies.<br>Help me find some way to talk about this team and please.<br>What's to say about Zach Randolph or his teammate Marc Gasol?<br>Will they remain a playoff team or just collapse in the fall?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, no one heeded my call. I guess bloggers don't respond to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADCz4pXYoVo\">Chuck Berry parodies</a> like I thought they would. Oh well. The Grizzlies are a solid team, the NBA's oatmeal really, and they should be able to make a playoff run while still being ignored by just about everyone outside Memphis. Marc Gasol, fresh from co-running the silver-medal Spanish team with more famous brother Pau, is one of the more underrated big men in the league. Then, of course, there's Tony Allen to contribute his crazy good defense and his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aa000G9\">just plain crazy Twitter account</a>. Still, for many basketball fans, they are like that indie movie or cable-TV show that your friends keep telling that you <em>have</em> to watch. The more they hard-sell, the less interested you become. </p> <p><strong>3 Dallas Mavericks</strong></p> <p>Before I could even start writing this, reports came in saying that Dirk Nowitzki had gotten injured and would be out for six weeks. That's a pretty brutal loss considering that very few teams' playoff chances revolve around one player as much those of the Mavericks. It didn't have to be like this, as Mark Cuban made no secret in the fact that he wanted in on Dwight Howard and, failing that, the chance to lure Deron Williams away from the Nets \u2013 losing out to his Russian counterpart in what I hope ends up being the start of a blood feud.</p> <p>Even with Nowitzki, this Dallas Mavericks team is full of questions: Does Mark Cuban have some secret plan to push the Mavs into serious contention this season? Will the troubled Delonte West last the season (<a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/10/17/mavs-lift-delonte-wests-suspension-he-can-play-wednesday/\">when he has already been suspended once</a>)? Do any of the once-perennial All-Stars Vince Carter, Elton Brand and Chris Kaman have enough left to add significant value to this team? Will Lamar Odom's defection back to Los Angeles be addition by subtraction? All of these questions will be up in the air. With the exception of the last one, they really should be better without Odom, the Real Househusband.</p> <p><strong>4 Houston Rockets</strong></p> <p>For most of the offseason it seemed as if the main story of the Houston Rockets is going to be \"Linsanity II\" as point guard Jeremy Lin left New York and went south to Texas, where he instantly became the face of the franchise. This may have been less because of Lin's above-average skills at the point and more because he was bringing his name recognition to a team that pretty much lacked everything. The Rockets, who were not expected to contend for anything this year other than avoiding the worst record in the West, seemed more interested in Lin because of the international fanbase they built up during the Yao Ming years than anything else. Still, we've seen Lin perform unexpected miracles on the court. (<a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/famous-jeremy-lin-couch-now-lost-history-190054458--nba.html\">Lin's famous couch, however, will not be making the trip.</a>)</p> <p>It seemed as if Lin were going to have to keep the team afloat by himself, but on Saturday the Thunder added James Harden to the mix, which seems like something of a desperation move on Houston's part. James Harden is a great player, a perennial All-Star, but he's not the number one option on a true contender. It seems like the Houston Rockets should be in something close to rebuilding mode, so giving up on some of these draft picks makes very little sense, they likely gave up more for Harden than the Orlando Magic received for superstar center Dwight Howard. Unless this is just one step of a larger process, it's hard not to see the decision to get Harden, like the move to bring in Lin, as at least as much of a marketing strategy as a basketball one. Fear the Linbeardity, Texas..</p> <p><strong>5 New Orleans Hornets</strong></p> <p>The last time we were talking about the New Orleans Hornets we were discussing the <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/blogs/nba-point-forward/2012/05/31/an-nba-draft-lottery-conspiracy-it-didnt-seem-that-way/index.html\">NBA Draft Conspiracy</a>. After the second Chris Paul trade - the league vetoed the first - the NBA-owned Hornets tumbled far enough down the standings to become a serious lottery team, and to other teams' suspicions, the team owned by the league ended up with the No1 pick in the draft. The Hornets, not being dumb, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10312378\">picked Anthony Davis of the University of Kentucky</a>, who has the most upside of any draft pick since Kevin Durant.</p> <p>The basketball conspiracy theorists, of which there are many, were suspicious: this could not have been a coincidence. Clearly, David Stern and company were pulling the strings, why else would the lottery itself take place in private if a shadowy cabal didn't want the Hornets to get the first pick of the draft? These conspiracies seem unlikely but if I were a Hornets fan, I would just run with it. It's nice to pretend that the commissioner was in your pocket.</p> <p>However, the Hornets got <a href=\"http://www.sportspickle.com/pictures/gallery/12080/the-10-greatest-example-of-anthony-davis-unibrow-tributes\">the Unibrow</a> and it seems likely that the acquisition will provide immediate dividends. Davis spent his summer vacation playing the role of the Human Victory Cigar for Team USA at London Olympics. In the first few games of the tournament, his first quasi-pro experience, he made some plays late against the \"just happy to be there\" countries which showed it will at least be fun to watch the kid play. </p> <p>For good measure, the Hornets snatched up Duke guard <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kb2ZDv8lBc\">Austin Rivers</a> (son of Celtics coach Doc) with the 10th pick. Rivers, with his \"shoot first and then shoot again and then ask questions later if there's time\" style could just as easily make a huge impact as flame out \u2013 either way he's bound to be interesting. Make no mistake, the Hornets are going to play some really bad basketball for a while and this season will all be growing pains, but they won't be terrible for very long. Thank the shadowy cabal, Hornets fans.</p> <p><strong>Prediction:<br>Western Conference Finals: Los Angeles Lakers OVER Oklahoma City Thunder</strong></p> <p>Unlike the Eastern Conference Finals, this series seems more in the air. The Thunder, assuming Durant and Westbrook are healthy, should be a well-oiled machine while the Lakers could be still working out their chemistry like the Miami Heat did in the first year of the LeBron era. I still like the Lakers' chances of advancing here. </p> <p><strong>Prediction:<br>NBA Finals: Miami Heat OVER Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p> <p>The NBA equivalent of a meteor game for 90% of basketball fans (ie, most of them will be rooting for a meteor to hit the arena), these Finals will still get the highest ratings in NBA history. In the aftermath, David Stern will buy a gold-plated mansion shaped like himself, LeBron James will receive notice from the US government that he is officially \"above the law\" and, lost in the excitement and hype, the Toronto Raptors will cease to exist and nobody will notice. Enjoy the 2012-13 season, everybody!</p>",
  "<p>Partnerships between major network operators, retailers, and banks have characterised the development of the mobile wallet, and are already becoming integral to the rise in popularity of these services in the UK and Europe.</p> <p>Just a few weeks ago MasterCard announced a new deal with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/aug/29/everything-everywhere-4g-ofcom?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Everything Everywhere</a> to offer its mobile wallet services exclusively to Orange and T-Mobile customers. Like many service providers, MasterCard believes the move will support the accelerated adoption of payments made with mobile devices thanks to Everything Everywhere's 27 million strong customer base. It's expected that one of the first products to be launched will be an near field communication (NFC)-enabled mobile payments service for those using the Everything Everywhere network.</p> <p>This is by no means the first partnership of its kind. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/project-oscar-mobile-payments?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Project Oscar</a> has now been given the green light by the European Commission, and as such some of the UK's leading mobile operators will be working together to develop a digital wallet. Everything Everywhere, O2 and Vodafone are expected to jointly release a unified smartphone-based service, offering an alternative to cash and credit cards.</p> <p>This approach to ecommerce will give consumers a joined up shopping experience, allowing them to purchase goods and services using their handsets offline in shops, using contactless technology, as well as online. Standardisation of mobile payments services through industry partnerships is a positive step.</p> <p>Project Oscar was born out of a desire by a number of mobile operators to create a single platform for mobile payments and mobile marketing systems in the UK, designed to open the door for the joint venture's combined 70.2 million customers to adopt mobile payments and related marketing services en masse.</p> <p>Currently, the UK is lagging behind in mobile payment adoption compared to other developed and developing nations. The UK's somewhat ageing banking system, which brings with it substantial regulation, is one hindrance. There is also a slow response from banks seeking to develop mobile payments services due to a lack of internal resources \u2013 both in terms of budget and personnel.</p> <p>However, the fact is that a variety of factors need to come together for mobile payments adoption to continue to increase, with standardisation just one important part, and consumer education a second factor.</p> <p>The London Olympics saw over 3,000 NFC terminals set up around the capital, which will have an impact upon awareness of the benefits of mobile payments for years to come. Barclays has also taken advantage of the fact that <a href=\"http://www.barclays.co.uk/Mobile/BarclaysPingit/P1242603570446\" title=\"\">Pingit</a> was one of the first mobile payments services to launch in the UK, utilising the technology to make thousands of NFC payments wristbands available to festival goers at this year's Wireless Festival.</p> <p>Some will, however, question whether there a downside to these exclusive partnerships in the long-term. Through limiting themselves to one audience or customer base, retailers and mobile operators are running the risk of missing out on a potential mass market opportunity. Many are already taking steps to remedy this approach, with O2 launching its <a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/money/wallet\" title=\"\">O2 Wallet application</a> to both its existing customer base and non-O2 customers.</p> <p>Similarly, after a short exclusivity period, Barclays Pingit services were made available to customers of all banks. If industry partnerships mean that certain services will not be available to all, the fact is that mass adoption will simply involve a 'survival of the fittest' process, where just one or two major providers will be likely to dominate an industry in which there are currently a large number of companies jostling for space.</p> <p>If mass adoption was simply down to buy-in from the main industry telecoms providers, retailers and mobile vendors, it would be easy to view the integration of NFC into the iPhone as a future industry turning point. However, the fact that Apple decided not to integrate NFC into its newly launched iPhone 5 highlights the wider developments necessary before mass adoption is a reality in the UK and abroad.</p> <p>Ultimately, we're still two or three years away from mass adoption of mobile payments, and with so many companies vying for attention in this space it's likely that institutions in effective partnerships will accelerate the roll out of their services.</p> <p>The development of a mobile payments offering for any major institution is a huge step in the UK and abroad, and Apple clearly realises that this needs to be integrated with existing offerings to maximise its usefulness to the end consumer. While partnerships are important, it's making the service useful and attractive for the consumer that really matters, and it's these developments that will be crucial to the growth of mobile wallet services in the UK.</p> <p><em>James Richards is VP of mobile at digital banking provider </em><a href=\"http://www.ie.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Intelligent Environments</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Stonewall has promised to press ahead with its annual bigot of the year award, despite pressure from two leading banks which have threatened to withdraw sponsorship.</p> <p>Barclays and Coutts both say they will rethink their support for the British gay charity's annual awards following complaints from Christian campaigners about the singling out of individuals for the bigot category.</p> <p>High profile figures, including Lord Maginnis and Scotland's Roman Catholic leader, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, have been shortlisted for the award after making insulting and inflammatory comments about homosexuality or gay marriage.</p> <p>\"Coutts are sponsors only of Stonewall's writer of the year award and have in no way been involved in the judging or support of the bigot of the year category,\" the bank said. \"We have advised Stonewall that we will be withdrawing our support of the awards unless they remove this category.\"</p> <p>Mark McLane, the managing director and head of global diversity and inclusion at Barclays, said his company did not support the bigot category \"either financially or in principle and have informed Stonewall that should they decide to continue with this category we will not support this event in the future. To label any individual so subjectively and pejoratively runs contrary to our view on fair treatment, and detracts from what should be a wholly positively focused event.\"</p> <p>Ben Summerskill, Stonewall's chief executive, said the charity had no intention of amending or dropping the category. \"We have never called anyone a bigot just because they disagreed with us,\" he said. \"All the nominees have gone well beyond what anyone normal would call a decent level of public discourse. We welcome sponsorship from anyone who shares our core values, but we have an obligation to the 3.6 million gay people to do what is right, and highlighting extreme examples of bigotry when we know how harmful this unpleasantness is to the self-esteem of young people is right.\"</p> <p>Five figures were shortlisted: Simon Lokodo, the Ugandan ethics and integrity minister, who disbanded meetings of gay equality groups and arrested activists; Maginnis, who described same-sex marriage as \"unnatural and deviant behaviour\"; O'Brien, who attacked same-sex relationships as \"harmful to the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing\" and compared them to slavery; Philip Tartaglia, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Glasgow, who said the late David Cairns MP may have died because he was gay and claimed the death was shrouded in a \"conspiracy of silence\"; and Alan Craig, the Christian campaigner and former leader of the Christian People's Alliance, who compared gay equality advocates to the invading forces of Nazi Germany, dubbing them the \"Gaystapo\".</p> <p>The bigot prize is one of three, with shortlists formed from votes by Stonewall supporters, the others being for community group and hero of the year. It is funded by individual donations.</p> <p>Among those nominated for the hero award is the Anglican churchman and Guardian columnist the Rev Giles Fraser. The event, to be held at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum on Thursday, will be hosted by the TV presenter Gok Wan.</p> <p>Andrea Minichiello Williams, the chief executive of Christian Concern, applauded the stance taken by Barclays and Coutts. \"In seeking to humiliate and intimidate those who hold mainstream views on marriage rather than engaging with their arguments, Stonewall is stifling robust public discussion of an issue of great importance to the future of our society,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It is deeply ironic that an organisation that claims to be opposed to bullying and even runs an initiative in primary schools entitled Celebrating Difference responds to difference of opinion by resorting to name-calling that, were it not more sinister, would be reminiscent of playground antics.\"</p> <p>Last year's winner of the bigot award was the Daily Mail writer Melanie Phillips. In 2010 it was the now justice secretary Chris Grayling, after he was secretly recorded upholding the right of bed and breakfast owners to bar gay couples. Last month, the 2012 nominee Craig said if he won and was invited, he would be willing to collect his prize in person.</p>",
  "<p>There are two four-letter words that sum up today's announcement that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/30/hitachi-next-generation-british-nuclear-plants?intcmp=122\">Hitachi is buying the Horizon nuclear power</a> business <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/29/nuclear-reactors-rwe-eon-energy\">abandoned by German-owned RWE and E.on</a> after the Fukushima disaster led Angela Merkel to turn her back on building new reactors. The first is \"phew\", the overwhelming sentiment from ministers and from Horizon's former owners. </p> <p>For ministers, the big hole in their low-carbon energy plans that would be left by a failure to get new nuclear plants built is now less likely, For RWE and E.on, they have offloaded the nuclear sites for a lot more cash - \u00a3700m - than they might have expected. The fact that even EDF, a supposed competitor to Horizon, \"welcomed\" Hitachi's purchase shows how close to meltdown the plan to build new nuclear plants has come.</p> <p>The second four-letter word, from those who oppose new nuclear power in the UK, is unprintable. Hitachi's purchase is undoubtedly a blow for them. But despite the government's delight \u2013 Prime minister <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_135/pn12_135.aspx\">David Cameron was rolled out to herald the news</a> \u2013 today's development is a small step on a long road. </p> <p>The second energy announcement today, the <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/wms_ccs_ner300/wms_ccs_ner300.aspx\">shortlisting of four carbon capture and storage projects</a> in the government's \u00a31bn competition, could be the more significant news. It now looks likely that contracts for one or two CCS demonstrations will be signed within a year. That's very welcome given the government's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/29/gas-energy-protest\">current emphasis on gas</a>, because that means CCS is going to be needed.</p> <p>But the prospect of new reactors at Horizon's sites at Wylfa on Anglesey and Oldbury in Gloucestershire remains much more distant. Cameron said: \"This is a decades-long, multi-billion pound vote of confidence in the UK,\" But what Hitachi has bought, whatever it says about \"a 100 year commitment\", is an option, nothing more. For its \u00a3700m, it now has sites with permission build two or three reactors on each. That is lot of money, but its probably less than 1% of the total value of running six reactors for 60 years.</p> <p>Before it does so, it needs to get its nuclear technology licensed in the UK: that can take years. Next, it has to finance tens of billions of pounds of investment to build the new plants. That will of course depend on what price the government decides to guarantee for electricity from new nuclear power.</p> <p>French state-controlled EDF is leading that crucial negotiation, which is the subject of intense speculation. The best guess for what EDF is demanding is high - probably <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/9471193/EDF-Energy-puts-price-cap-on-Hinkley-Point-nuclear-plant.html\">between \u00a3100 and \u00a3140 per MWh</a>, comparable to offshore wind. The question is whether ministers are prepared to commit energy customers to paying that for decades. It is notable that, despite half a century of taxpayer subsidies, the cost of nuclear energy is rising, while the cost of energy from the much younger renewable sector is falling.</p> <p>But do not underestimate the government's attachment to the nuclear project. You'd be forgiven for thinking the energy ministry had been entirely captured by the nuclear industry with, as I reported a year ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/dec/05/energy-companies-lend-staff-government\">several EDF staff working on secondment in government</a> and civil servants returning the favour by working for the energy companies, including Horizon.</p> <p>There was more today, with the announcement of a new Nuclear Industry Council. The Nuclear Industry Association's chairman John Hutton said: \"The new council symbolises the long-term strategic partnership developing between the UK nuclear industry and the government.\" It certainly does. There is no Renewable Industry Council or any renewable energy industry staff on secondment in the department for energy and climate change (Decc).</p> <p>The CCS news is thankfully more straightforward, and allows the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/oct/19/david-cameron-longannet-carbon-capture\">five-year fiasco of the previous CCS competition</a> to be buried. In many scenarios CCS is crucial to meeting future carbon targets and even more so should new nuclear falter. Minister's shortlisted the four projects in seven months and those chosen wisely span the range of CCS technology. Only one is on a gas plant, with the other three on coal power stations. That is unfortunate, given the government's current \"dash for gas\", says Prof Stuart Haszeldine, a CCS expert at University of Edinburgh, but results from a historical focus in coal. </p> <p>One surprise was the failure of <a href=\"http://www.2coenergy.com/latest_news.html\">2Co Energy's Don Valley CCS project</a> to wind government support, given that it was seen to be the most advanced and most favoured by the EU for potential matched funding. But Haszeldine said there were \"sensible\" reasons for the decision, including the lack of permission for a 50km onshore pipeline.</p> <p>The coalition is committed to supporting four commercial-scale CCS projects, but this competition won't support more than two. Haszeldine says splitting the \u00a31bn pledged by government between a pair of projects \"would just about work\". He adds: \"There is now a six-week period to do the commercial bit. It's about Decc knocking heads together to see if the companies can improve the commercial terms of the deals by co-operating\" on, for example, shared pipelines.</p> <p>In a decade or two's time, I wonder which of today's two announcements - nuclear and CCS - will have been more significant: a renaissance for an old industry or the flowering of a new one.</p>",

  "<p>On <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_F%C3%A9lix_Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny\" title=\"\">Cocody University</a> campus, the biggest in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, workers are busy \u2013 finishing paint jobs, planting shrubs and installing tables and chairs for around 62,000 students (out of 85,000 in the whole country). The university is reopening after 18 months. All three Ivorian universities closed in April 2011, following \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/mar/09/laurent-gbagbo-to-blame-for-crisis\" title=\"\"><em>les \u00e9v\u00e8nements</em></a>\", as they euphemistically call the civil war between supporters of former president Laurent Gbagbo's Ivorian People's Front and those who backed the current president, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alassane-ouattara\" title=\"\">Alassane Ouattara</a>. Around 3,000 people were killed during the conflict.</p> <p>In the last decade, the Student Federation of Ivory Coast (Fesci) gradually took over the Cocody campus, and it was the scene of violent clashes during the civil war. The \"student union\" had become a pro-Gbagbo militia led by fake students, and it imposed a reign of terror based on racketeering, rape and murder. \"During the repairs a mass grave was discovered on the campus,\" says Ciss\u00e9 Ibrahima Bacongo, the higher education and research minister.</p> <p>After being vandalised and stripped bare, nothing remained of the buildings but their outer shell. All the computers, files, records and books had vanished. \"As if they had wanted to make it impossible for the students to return,\" the minister recalls. Before the repairs could begin, the authorities had to evacuate several thousand squatters who settled in the wreckage of the buildings.</p> <p>Rebuilding the universities and making the start of the new school year a success thus became a key political issue for the government. To finish the repairs in record time, the ministry turned to local building contractors and authorised them to take out loans to cover the initial funding of work, worth about $220m \u2013 three times the original estimate.</p> <p>\"It's true that we overlooked the cost&#xa0;of laying new turf, repairing the&#xa0;roads and laying optic fibre,\" Bacongo admits. But the budget overrun is so large that Ouattara has ordered an inquiry into the tendering process.</p> <p>In just a few months there has been a radical change. Visiting the campus in September, the French ambassador, Georges Serre, said: \"I am bowled over by the speed and quality of the work carried out.\" The campus now boasts 140 buildings \u2013 libraries, brand new lecture theatres, student residences and sports facilities \u2013 spread over a 200-hectare landscaped park and connected by a fibre-optic network. On 3 September, at the official re-opening ceremony, the education minister presented the keys of the country's three main universities to their newly appointed presidents.</p> <p>Cocody has been renamed after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Houphou%C3%ABt-Boigny\" title=\"\">F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny</a>, the country's first president after independence. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universit%C3%A9_d'Abobo-Adjam%C3%A9\" title=\"\">Abobo-Adjam\u00e9</a>, also in Abidjan and originally the science faculty, has become a separate establishment under a new name, Nangui-Abrogoua, after the warrior who founded the former capital in the 18th century. Last, Bouak\u00e9 has become Alassane Ouattara University, in honour of the president.</p> <p>It is an administrative challenge to enrol \u2013 or re-enrol \u2013 students when all the records have been lost. In addition, there are three years' worth of school-leavers, who have been deprived of higher education since June 2010 and must now be accommodated in the first-year intake.</p> <p>\"We asked members of the administrative staff to bring back any handwritten records they might have kept, so that they could be scanned with help from the Association of French-speaking Universities,\" says Yao Tano, president of Nangui-Abrogoua University. New teaching staff had to be recruited too, including 100 or so for Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny and another 30 at Nangui-Abrogoua, drawing on the Ivorian diaspora in an attempt to bring graduates home from abroad, particularly from France.</p> <p>The students whom Le Monde met at the end of September were doubtful about classes actually starting as planned. Computers and lab equipment still hadn't arrived. They were also worried about the increase in fees, up from around $12 to $200 for a bachelor's degree \u2013 with the state covering two-thirds of the cost this year. About 30 students have already started their course at Abidjan Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. \"It is urgent to consolidate secondary education, which has suffered recently, as you can see from the poor 17% success rate for the baccalaureate exam this year,\" says Valy Sidib\u00e9, the school's head.</p> <p>The government has seized the opportunity to reorganise higher education to bring it into line with international standards, in particular the three-tier degree system. Admissions will be restricted to suit the real capacity of specific courses, but selection criteria have yet to be decided. \"We will only allow students to repeat a year once,\" says Bacongo, who is determined to oust \"professional\" students, thought to number between 2,000 and 5,000, including Fesci troublemakers. The government also plans to launch three new universities in other areas of the country.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article appeared in the </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",
  "<p>I was fascinated by Hanna Rosin's article, Men: an endangered species? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/30/hanna-rosin-end-men-extract?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(19 October)</a>. Rosin perceptively catalogued the changing roles of men and women both in the economy and in the home. But what I missed was any consideration of the effect that these changes have on children: the one group in our society that is voiceless and invisible. From the womb onwards it is the voices of men and women that we hear, not the voices of the children.</p> <p>The facts were spelled out by President Obama himself, a man who grew up without a father. In a speech on Father's Day 2008, he said: \"Children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of school and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.\" Fatherlessness is a serious problem in the newly emerging society so expertly mapped by Rosin. And for many children, actual fatherlessness is compounded by functional motherlessness as children are shuttled from bed to the childminder to school, back to childminder and back to bed.</p> <p>I am not arguing for the hopeless policy of putting the clock back, but for a more complete understanding of the roles of men and women that includes the needs and rights, not only of the adults, but of the people least able to make their voices heard, their children.<br><strong>Martin Down</strong><br>Witney, UK</p> <p>\u2022 What is Hanna Rosin saying? A number of things: a) women are making progress in all fields; b) men have difficulty coping with the change; c) in general, this is good. She is generally right \u2013 especially about the last. We certainly need more women in top places \u2013 both in politics and in the economy.</p> <p>But why are women so adaptable and men so inflexible? Rosin says that the nature v nurture question on this is unanswerable, but it is clear she is leaning towards the latter explanation.</p> <p>Alas, it turns out that although she mentions evolutionary psychology her view of it is rather simplistic. Evolutionary psychology points to the interaction between genes and the environment. There is a spectrum of traits and behaviours \u2013 from ones that are almost exclusively determined by genes to ones almost exclusively determined by society.</p> <p>Violence is one of the former. Rosin says that women are becoming more aggressive and even violent. Are they? Are we to assume they are going to overtake men at some point \u2013 as they have in the field of academic success? I do not think so.</p> <p>Mate preferences fall somewhere in between. Rosin says that there is an international market for spouses, with men looking for women with more traditional views. I would like to argue that the main reason behind this market is different: men use their higher status to find younger women from poorer countries.</p> <p>And what about women? Why is there no similar market for men \u2013 with the modern, successful women looking for different men? Could it be that despite their success, women are still looking for someone swooping in on a white horse?</p> <p>Rosin's last point that there is no \"natural order\", only the way things are, is the perfect expression of the moralistic fallacy. It suggests that things can change in any direction we would like \u2013 without constraints.</p> <p>Yet as the great EO Wilson once said, \"nature holds us on a leash\". There may be no natural order but there are natural predispositions. Would it not be great if culture and&#xa0;socialisation could rid us of our&#xa0;sweet tooth? Think about this next time you walk past an ice-cream shop.<br><strong>Nick Michelioudakis</strong><br>Athens, Greece</p> <p><strong>Cuban missile crisis</strong></p> <p>I was disappointed to read Richard Gott's article on the Cuban missile crisis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/what-cuban-missile-crisis?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(How Cuba won the missile crisis, 19 October)</a>, even though I agreed with everything he wrote. The problem was what he left out, which concerns US activities the previous year. The standard US account blames the Russians for an act of aggression when they began to install missile bases in Cuba in 1962. Kennedy is then presented as a heroic statesman who takes the world to the brink of nuclear disaster, but manages to avert a third world war by sheer determination.</p> <p>What the US account conveniently omits is the installation of US missile bases in Turkey and Italy the previous year. The Russians had protested about those installations \u2013 which are roughly the same distance as that from Cuba to the US. They described it as an act of aggression because it destabilised the balance of power between the two military systems. The US ignored those protests and went ahead. Seen in that context, the Cuban missile crisis was caused by the US, not by Russia.</p> <p>Luckily for all of us, reason won through and the crisis was resolved. The US achieved a propaganda victory and was able to peddle its distorted account of events. Anyone writing about those events should make sure to provide the proper context, to avoid perpetuating a misleading account.<br><strong>Les Reid</strong><br>Edinburgh, UK</p> <p>\u2022 At least Richard Gott does not say that the Cubans won the missile crisis. I initially sympathised with the revolution. But the sad fact is that Cubans had great freedom of inquiry and expression under Batista. Dissenters did not physically rot in harsh jails. Castro kept his freedom because of Batista's leniency.</p> <p>The American policy towards Cuba has only a marginal effect on its economy. The sad fact is that under Batista the Cuban economy was among the best in Latin America rather than among the worst under Castro. I regret that Kennedy double-crossed the Cuban exiles at the time of the Bay of Pigs and set them up for failure.<br><strong>Morton A Kaplan</strong><br>Chicago, Illinois, US</p> <p><strong>Hard burden of proof</strong></p> <p>The Jimmy Savile case has highlighted how the odds are stacked against victims. Jonathan Freedland describes \"the curious protection granted to so many rapists: the refusal to believe the victims\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/12/evil-jimmy-savile-not-alone\" title=\"\">(This evil is not just one man's, 19 October)</a>.</p> <p>Not only is this the case, but legally the burden of the proof is on the victim. Rape, like any crime, has to be proven \"beyond reasonable doubt\", failing which the accused is to be considered innocent. But what exactly does this mean?</p> <p>That hard evidence is required? Or that the victim's side of the story is more plausible than that of the accused? DNA testing is far from systematic; surveillance cameras are usually not available.</p> <p>Having served recently on jury service without much guidance as to how to interpret \"beyond reasonable doubt\", several jurors were unwilling to return a guilty verdict in the absence of hard proof. For any rape that takes place without witnesses the legal system makes it extremely difficult to reach a verdict of guilty.<br><strong>Maroussia Rochigneux</strong><br>Bristol, UK</p> <p><strong>Pakistan: it's complicated</strong></p> <p>It is disappointing to find in the article about Malala Yousafzai, shot by the Taliban in Swat valley <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/malala-yousafzai-pakistan?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Anger as Taliban shoot girl who spoke out, 19 October)</a>, a lack of understanding of the political forces that shape the interlinked conflicts in Pakistan. The article refers to a solidarity rally in Karachi that 40,000 people attended. Pakistani papers reported that this was a rally held by the MQM (Muttahida Quami Movement), which is in a violent conflict in Karachi with the Pashtun party, the AMP (the Taliban are Pashtun).</p> <p>The solidarity rally, then, was not simply a spontaneous show of solidarity by Karachi-ites, as suggested by the Guardian's article, but a calculated game of political point-scoring between two political parties engaged in a very sophisticated kind of gang war. The solidarity rally was less about Malala Yousafzai and more about the conflict in Karachi.</p> <p>This is a significant misrepresentation of events.<br><strong>Antonia Settle</strong><br>Brunswick, Victoria, Australia</p> <p><strong>Hypocrisy over China</strong></p> <p>I was startled by the sheer hypocritical claims made by official US institutions against Chinese companies as emphasised by Isabel Hilton <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/10/huawei-china-difference\" title=\"\">(China is indeed different, October 19)</a>.

  "<p>I am glad I'm not alone in scorning the media overkill on hurricane Sandy. My colleague Michael White has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/30/frankenstorm-sandy-monstrous-media-hysteria\">rightly noted the over-the-top coverage</a> and scores of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts\">commenters to our live blog </a>have been underwhelmed by the attention paid to a storm simply because it struck the United States.</p> <p>That last point is the most telling of all. Hundreds of people die from hurricanes in other countries every year without the western media appearing to notice. </p> <p>I concede that all news is local. So the American newspapers and TV news outlets can be forgiven for concentrating so much attention on a storm that is ravaging the country's eastern seaboard.</p> <p>But why do global TV outlets, such as CNN, think what happens in the US is important enough to warrant beaming to the rest of the world as its main news item?</p> <p>More significant still, why have British media assumed that it should be the leading news story of the last couple of days?</p> <p>In my Marxist student days, I might well have suggested that Britain was hopelessly subject to US cultural hegemony. Many years on from that, I am still inclined to that viewpoint.</p> <p>Despite the long-ago fracturing of the so-called \"special relationship\", we (by which I mean editors, journalists, publishers) still assume that what happens in America is hugely relevant to people in Britain.</p> <p>Sure, they speak the same language, but note how little attention has been paid to the fact that hurricane Sandy is having a devastating effect on Canada. Yet coverage of that country's plight has been virtually nil thus far.</p> <p>Then again, virtually every British newspaper and broadcaster has correspondents in New York or Washington, or both. There are fewer US bureaux, with many fewer staff, than used to be the case, but our media still think US-based journalists are crucial news-gatherers.</p> <p>This is understandable in historical terms and it must be said, despite the challenges to US global superiority, America remains a hugely powerful presence.</p> <p>But is it not insensitive to realise that we pay greater attention to its problems - and its storm victims - rather than those elsewhere?</p> <p>In a world shrunk smaller by digital communications, we cannot say that we do not know what happens in other countries.</p> <p>Commenters to the live blog have provided many examples of our oversight. For example, <strong>GilbertTheAlien</strong> counted 65 Guardian articles on hurricane Sandy, but only eight of these referred to its effect on the Caribbean.</p> <p>Yet just consider the figures: <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/ap/2012-10-29/cubas-2nd-city-without-power-water-after-sandy\">69 deaths in total,</a> including 52 people in Haiti, 11 in Cuba, two in the Bahamas, two in the Dominican Republic, one in Jamaica and one in Puerto Rico.</p> <p><strong>James Kelly</strong> made a similar point. Front pages tell of 16 deaths in the US while the Haitian deaths get virtually no mention.</p> <p>And <strong>Monkeybiz</strong> reminded us that 19 people were killed by a typhoon in the Philippines last week, one of more than a dozen such catastrophes to hit that country this year. \"Oh,\" he remarked sarcastically, \"you didn't hear about that?\"</p> <p>No we didn't. We seem to accept that storms routinely hit countries outside the developed world and it's therefore of no particular news value. That may be understandable because, as I say, news is local.</p> <p>But what happens to nations in the developed world is very different. Huge coverage was devoted to the earthquake that struck Christchurch in New Zealand in September 2010, for instance. </p> <p>Even so, it was small beer compared to the obsession with every big storm that strikes - or threatens to strike - anywhere in the United States. That is treated in Britain much as if it's a domestic story.</p> <p>One other factor is important: 24-hour TV news outlets. Storms are perfect for rolling news - they provide lots of film footage opportunities, and how wonderful it must be for editors to show a correspondent battered by high winds and soaked by rain shouting into a microphone. It has the immediacy and drama of war reporting without the guns.</p> <p>Our acceptance of the United States as the most important country outside Britain, more important indeed than any of our European neighbours, is an uncomfortable truth to acknowledge. It undoubtedly skews our news sense\u2026 an unconscious bias that should give us pause for thought as we contemplate those non-American victims of hurricane Sandy.</p>",
  "<p>Amid all the glitz of the launches last week of the Surface tablet and Windows 8 operating system, Microsoft also quietly \u2013 and ahead of schedule \u2013 released to manufacturing the latest versions of three of its biggest enterprise brands: Sharepoint, Exchange and Office.</p> <p>The public preview of Office has been around for a while <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/officepreview\" title=\"\">and you can still download and use it</a> for two months after the full version goes on sale, which is vaguely promised for the first quarter of next year.</p> <p>This new version of Office moves forward in two big ways: visually, and with its links to the cloud.</p> <p>It looks very different indeed; gone are the bubblegum icons and candy colours of yesteryear, and in their place is a flat, sleek look. It takes a bit of getting used to.</p> <p>And the options for personalising the look are minimal. The accent colour is fixed for each app; you can choose from a range of frankly pointless grey-squiggle themes, and you can choose white, light grey or dark grey surrounds \u2013 and that's it.</p> <p>The visual style brings Office in line with the look of Windows 8, which is also very flat \u2013 no more Aero glass or 3D effects.</p> <p>Crucially, it also optimises the suite for touch use \u2013 you can flip between a desktop mode and a touch mode, with the latter adding more space between icons in the ribbon (yes, the much-derided ribbon is in this version too, but you can hide it) to make it more fat-finger-friendly.</p> <p>The cloud stuff is right at the front of everything in this new version of Office \u2013 the default Save location is Skydrive, not My Documents.</p> <p>Sign in with your Hotmail, Windows Live, Technet or any other Microsoft ID and your Skydrive will be accessible on all your devices \u2013 Windows Phone, iOS and Android.</p> <p>If you're working at a computer that doesn't have Office on it, <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/web-apps/\" title=\"\">your Skydrive documents will open for editing in Office Web Apps</a> (on a Mac, PC or Windows phone \u2013 Android and iOS users will have to make do with just reading them for now).</p> <p>You will be able to buy standalone versions of Office 2013, but <a href=\"http://blogs.office.com/b/office-news/archive/2012/09/17/the-new-office-365-subscriptions-for-consumers-and-small-businesses.aspx\" title=\"\">the pricing options for Office 365 are designed to be attractive</a>. And there are benefits to going for Office 365, the cloud version: for $99 a year (no UK price yet, and straight $-\u00a3 conversion isn't an indicator of UK pricing), home users can use it on five machines (there will be a Mac version too) while enterprise users can choose from packages that include hosted Exchange.</p> <p>An in-depth dig around all the new features is beyond the scope of Technophile, but here are some highlights: Apps!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398564916\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351604866129/Office-2013-007.jpg\" alt=\"Office 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outlook touch view Photograph: Kate Bevan/guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Bevan/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Office has caught the apps bug <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/store/\" title=\"\">and third-party developers are already crafting widgets to add functionality</a>. Most of the Outlook apps require Exchange 2013, which may have gone RTM, but which won't be seen in the wild, never mind your office, for some time, so don't get too excited about those just yet.</p> <p>In Powerpoint, presenter view is vastly improved. You can see the next animation/next slide, your timings and any notes.</p> <p>Word can finally handle PDFs natively; you can open a PDF file as a Word document, where it retains all its PDF cleverness but becomes editable. The dialog box as you open it warns it could take some time, but on my desktop (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2011/feb/22/building-pc-self-built\" title=\"\">a fast machine home-built last year</a>) the process was pretty much instant.</p> <p>In Excel, you can pull in data from a website via the in-app brower: useful if you want to play with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\" title=\"\">the Guardian's datastore</a>. Excel will also suggest pivot tables for you, and flash-fill fields for you.</p> <p>Outlook now pulls all your duplicate contacts together in one unified contact card in the People view (though I've found that a bit flaky about <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/social-connector-for-microsoft-outlook-HA101794273.aspx\" title=\"\">linking contacts to Facebook via the Office social connector</a>). You can also peek at your calendar while in another view, and get weather updates in the calendar view (no, I have no idea why that's been added, either).</p> <p>One for admins to note is that Outlook can now connect to mail servers via ActiveSync, and in fact Exchange 2013 ditches MAPI altogether in favour of ActiveSync. Admins will need to keep an eye on the number of connections users are making via both their own and work devices in a BYOD environment.</p> <p>In most apps you can do screengrabs from within Office \u2013 no need to go via your imaging application \u2013 and insert them into the document. You can also search for images and video online and edit/play those in the document.</p> <p>Not everyone will like the determined nudge towards the cloud, and given a lot of the negative feedback for the new look for Windows 8, not everyone is going to like the visual overhaul, either.</p> <p>However, for the home user, the pricing is much more attractive, especially if you go for the Office 365 subscription model. How much of the new functionality you actually use remains to be seen, and whether you think it's worth upgrading for.</p> <p>If there's a touchscreen device in your future, it's certainly worth considering (and a version of Office 2013 comes with the RT Surface tablets anyway).</p> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> interface much better for touch, tight integration with the cloud, attractive pricing, new features</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Cloud approach not to everyone's taste, third-party apps (so far) of dubious usefulness.</p> <p><strong>Standalone versions:</strong> $139.99 (Home &amp; Student), $219.99 (Home &amp; Business), $399.99 (Professional). No pricing for other regions yet.</p>",
  "<p>Today, to mark the arrival of 4G and cut through the marketing noise, we are asking Guardian readers to help create a mobile internet speed map of the UK, with results for each network.</p> <p>To find out how fast your network is, be it 3G or 4G, complete a <a href=\"http://gu-mobile-broadband.appspot.com/\">quick speed test</a> on your mobile phone. This will plot the results by network onto a map of the UK, which we will publish in a week's time.</p> <p>You can run tests in as many locations and as many times as you like. Just switch off any wifi connection to make sure you are measuring the mobile network and not your broadband speed, agree to let us register your location, and put a tick next to the name of your service provider.</p> <p>To give an idea of the speeds to expect, the top laboratory-tested download rate on EE's network is around 50 megabits per second (Mbps) \u2013 equal to superfast home broadband. In real life conditions, the company is forecasting speeds of between 8 and 12Mbps.</p> <p>In fact, this is on a par with the latest version of 3G, which uses two antennas in a phone to double the usual speed. If you are standing under the right 3G mast with the right phone, at time when there are not too many other users vying for bandwidth, you should be able to get a speed comparable to EE's.</p> <p>\"Technology-wise, 4G is an evolution,\" says James Barford, telecoms expert at Enders Analysis. \"The latest version of 3G is quite close in<br>performance to the current 4G. That said, EE's network will be virtually empty for at least six months, so the speeds experienced are likely to be impressive.\"</p> <p>Tests by the network operators themselves show slow but steady progress, with speeds having doubled from a nationwide average of around 1.5mbps in the middle of 2010 to 3mbps today. Given that at least 2mbps is required on home broadband to watch video from services like the BBC's iPlayer, it looks like we are receiving the bare minimum needed for the modern internet. An estimated 25% of the UK population still cannot get a 3G signal.</p> <p>With your help, the Guardian we can uncover who is delivering the best service in which areas today.</p> <p><em><strong>Update Tuesday 6 November: </strong>The speed test is now closed.

Photograph: Dave Hill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hill/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One week ago I attended a conference at Olympia called <a href=\"http://placewestlondon.co.uk/conference/programme-draft/\">Place West London</a>, where politicians, regeneration sages and the property trade gathered to talk money, land and homes. I first listened to Councillor Andrew Johnson, Hammersmith and Fulham (H&amp;F) council's <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Council_and_Democracy/Councillors_and_MPs/Councillors/Councillor_Andrew_Johnson.asp\">cabinet member for housing</a>, who addressed the implications for local authorities of new powers and responsibilities devolved to them. </p> <p>He said that for the first time, \"we have meaningful control of our housing assets,\" which meant taking, \"meaningful, long term financial decisions.\" A 30-year business plan was required, allowing for future investment. There was \"more local political accountability,\" which he described as \"a mixed blessing at times.\" He was disappointed that, \"Local authorities do not have the freedom to manage housing stock,\" to the same degree as housing associations have. \"Crucially, as far as I'm concerned,\" he said, \"We are still unable to set market rates or to share equity in council house property.\"</p> <p>Johnson's brief peroration was directly about the borough he was representing: \"Hammersmith and Fulham is a borough of opportunity,\" he said, repeating a core slogan of the Conservative administration. \"We are an ambitious borough, but we are also a borough that sees a failure in the current housing market within London.\" He said that H&amp;F has the fourth highest property property prices in the UK, 34% social housing and only 3% of housing in the \"intermediate\" category - the more expensive end of the \"affordable\" range, where aspiring home owners look to get a toe hold on the property ladder. This dearth of intermediate homes was Johnson's evidence for the market failure he identified and wished to correct. \"Hammersmith and Fulham is determined to look to build for the middle market,\" he said.</p> <p>This was not a new statement of intent. It has been a public cry of H&amp;F ever since the Conservatives won control of the borough under Stephen Greenhalgh, now Boris Johnson's policing office chief, in 2006. When famously declaring the borough open for business\" in September 2007, Greenhalgh told a <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Directory/Business/Business_support_and_Advice/Economic_development/83998_Developers_Summit.asp\">summit of property developers</a> that his administration wanted to \"build a housing ladder of opportunity for all.\" Three months earlier H&amp;F's <a href=\"http://www.lbhf.gov.uk/Images/Core%20Strategy%20FINAL%20w%20cover%20translations_tcm21-81569.pdf\">preferred \"core strategy\" options document (pdf)</a> included addressing \"the demand for housing and the lack of housing for households with incomes of between about \u00a319,000 and \u00a360,000.\" The document continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>The council will seek 40% affordable housing in new developments. Of the affordable housing, 10-15% will be social rented housing and 25-30% intermediate housing. The council will also expect a proportion of the market housing to be low cost market housing and affordable to households on moderate incomes.</p> </blockquote> <p>After Johnson's session was complete I moved rooms to listen to an update on the <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/the-future/project_area/\">Earls Court project</a>, one of London's largest redevelopment schemes and a subject of great interest to me as it seems to crystalise key regeneration issues of this \"localist\" age. Most of the land in question falls within H&amp;F's borders. Stephen Greenhalgh remains a keen supporter of the project, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">describing it to the Guardian</a> earlier this year as \"the best deal in the history of redevelopment in London.\" </p> <p>The update was provided by Richard Powell, who is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">director of planning and development of EC Properties</a>, the wholly-owned subsidiary of H&amp;F's developer partner <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/our_people/senior_mgmt_team/\">Capco</a> that is responsible for the Earls Court project.</p> <p>Before Powell addressed a gathering of maybe 30 people, I asked him a couple of questions. He was good enough to answer them on the record. Was he confident that the Earls Court project would actually go ahead in the end? \"Yes,\" he replied. I pointed out that critics variously say that it's too big and complicated, that Capco won't be able to raise the money it needs and that the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/12/us-hongkong-sunhungkai-idUSBRE89B0CA20121012\">pending corruption trial</a> of two members of the Kwok family from Hong Kong, one of whose property businesses has <a href=\"http://www.capitalandcounties.com/news/press_releases/?id=65846\">joined forces with Capco</a> to fund the development of a part of the project area, does not bode well. Wasn't it all getting rather messy? </p> <p>Powell said he thought such a concern was valid - there are, for example, a lot of different interested parties, including Transport for London, Kensington and Chelsea and the Greater London Authority - and acknowledged that the Earls Court project is \"a grand plan.\" But he pointed out that Capco and EC had been setting out their stall for months and years and, \"We are just very keen to deliver on our promises.\" </p> <p>I asked Powell about the allegations that a so-called \"VIP list\" or \"Early Movers List\" has been compiled of residents of the Gibbs Green and West Kensington estates who've been promised preferential treatment in the allocation of replacement homes for their existing ones, which are threatened with demolition as part of the Earls Court project, in return for expressing support for the project. </p> <p>The council has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/22/hammersmith-and-fulham-earls-court-project-u-turn\">commissioned an investigation</a> into these <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2012/oct/26/earls-court-project-vip-list-allegations-richard-osband\">allegations</a> following the delivery of a dossier to the police, which claims to contain evidence that council officers were involved in making such promises and argues that, if so, this would be illegal. I've heard an assortment of stories of promises of one type of another of new homes being made to residents by people favouring the project. Did Powell think any of them were true? He said that in view of the police receiving the dossier and the council's investigation it wouldn't be appropriate to comment.</p> <p>I also asked him about responses to the council's consultation of residents who'd be affected by the project, primarily those of the occupants of the 760 homes that the West Kensington and Gibbs Green estates comprise. Powell said that Capco had responded to an earlier consultation by trying to, \"get into the community and make sure people really understood what was happening.\" </p> <p>He also pointed out that responses to the consultation I was referring to, which was about the council's plan to sell the land the estates stand on to Capco, had been \"broadly supportive\" from residents in the wider area, though he acknowledged that from the estates themselves - where the response rate was very high, compared with what I pointed out was a very low one among residents in the surrounding area - \"the numbers were the other way round.\" He said he'd looked at the feedback earlier in the year. \"It was interesting,\" he said, but added that, \"ultimately, that's the council's decision - it wasn't our decision to include the estates in the plans.\"</p> <p>Powell then delivered his update, in which he described the Earls Court project as, \"Trying to deliver what's great about London,\" in a part of the city that had been by-passed by previous phases of development. He made light of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/oct/12/earsl-court-project-legal-challenge-go-ahead\">forthcoming judicial review</a> of a key planning document relating to the scheme, saying in effect that such things were to be expected. He envisaged a new \"district of squares,\" preferring the term to \"villages.\" The guiding mantra, he said, is \"London-plus.\" And he reprised the project's main selling points of job creation, imaginative place-making, the provision of green space, a new high street, exterior improvements to Underground stations and the building of 7,500 new homes in all.</p> <p>A key question for me is the amount of these 7,500 homes that will be genuinely affordable to the very \"middle market\" people Andrew Johnson had said during the previous hour that his borough is determined to help; the same people, in fact, that Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9593203/London-has-turned-its-back-on-the-very-people-it-needs-most.html\">spoke up for</a> earlier this month in his Telegraph column. Powell relayed to his audience that 1,500 of the 7,500 will be categorised \"affordable,\" with 760 of these being the replacement homes promised to residents of West Kensington and Gibbs Green, leaving \"an additional\" figure of 740, all in the \"intermediate\" affordable category. </p> <p>I put it to Powell that this was a very low percentage - about 11% once you stripped out the 760 replacements, which is far from what has H&amp;F publicly aspired to. He replied that hitting affordable targets of up to 50% was proving difficult all over London, and that the \"joint financial model\" on which the Earls Court project is based, \"went through an independent test by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_Office_Agency\">Valuation Office</a>, which he said was \"pretty similar to most other projects,\" and that the affordable housing element had emerged from this. </p> <p>The wider context was the scheme's overall viability. In other words, as Powell put it, \"Making sure this scheme can happen. These sorts of projects, [when they] are fairly dogmatic about policy, often never get off the ground. The one thing that I'm very very keen on, is that this bloody thing happens and that we don't just talk about it as some interesting design exercise. So from the viability point of view I think we now are on the right side of the line to give ourselves a fighting chance.\"</p> <p>I asked if the inclusion of the two estates in the development area had, perhaps, made things more difficult for EC Properties/Capco. I had in mind that, as Powell had earlier reminded me, it was H&amp;F that had wanted them included, and also that opposition among their residents was so strong. </p> <p>Powell, replied: \"I think - and I guess I would wouldn't I? - that, actually, the inclusion of all of this land in a comprehensive development is a good solution, and it will enhance the lives of all of the neighbourhoods that live in the broader area. I think they will all be able to benefit through the employment and training budgets, and everything that can flow from this. But I fully accept that living on the estates at the moment there is a level of uncertainty - hang on a second, what is going on here and what's going to happen? [But] we have done a pretty unprecedented level of planning consultation...I do think, though, that overall the benefits of the system justify the inclusion of this whole area - this phased development over time.\"</p> <p>Finally, I pressed him further on the opposition of the two estates' residents. Was there a concern that Capco and EC Properties would be seen as the archetypal, big, nasty property developer trampling over the little people? Could such a perception be damaging? </p> <p>In his reply Powell said that, \"We want to see what's best for London, what's best for the borough, and what's best for the residents of the estates,\" and that, \"Hammersmith and Fulham are quite clear that on the basis of all their information and all the other benefits which can flow from very substantial investment in this part of town, that it is worth moving forward on that basis.\"</p> <p>He stressed that, \"From our point of view, we just want to be shoulder to shoulder with Hammersmith and Fulham. We want to make sure there is no misalignment of interests, and we're able to move forward together. As I say, I think the overall benefits of the scheme, in the long term, are worthwhile, and we'll be pursuing it with vigour.\"</p> <p>I was later told that that by the end of Powell's talk, Andrew Johnson had joined the gathering, sitting near the back of the room. Had I known, I might have asked him about the low percentage of homes envisaged by the Earls Court project that might be affordable to those struggling middle market Londoners for whom he and Mayor Johnson have expressed concern, and if he truly believes that no more could have been provided. </p> <p>I might also have put it to him that apart from Capco and Tory politicians such as himself and the London mayor, very few people are speaking up for the Earls Court project as it stands. And, who knows, maybe even some of them are having doubts.</p>",

This one was done by a three-year-old,\" the school's English headteacher says, pointing to a whimsical picture that \u2013 instead of a bloom \u2013 shows a purple-and-blue snail on top of a green stalk. \"It may not be perfect but it's his.\"</p> <p>Nurturing creativity and independence lies at the heart of the curriculum at this hyper-modern school, not far from the edge of Nairobi's national park. It is the first east African addition to the <a href=\"http://www.gemseducation.com/\" title=\"\">Gems education group's</a> network of schools, which cater for 110,000 pupils in countries ranging from China to the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>The school, which opened in September, has about 50 students and a host of construction workers. The Olympic running track is still a muddy crater; men in hard hats are scaling scaffolding to finish the 400-seat auditorium.</p> <p>For now, the school admits children aged three to 13. But the upper floors will be finished next year, offering education up to the age of about 18 \u2013 a rare commodity at British curriculum private schools in the capital of east Africa's largest economy.</p> <p>Roberts says she is hoping for a minimum of 300 pupils by next September. The school can take 120 boarders and has a maximum capacity of 1,000 pupils. <a href=\"http://www.gemscambridgeinternationalschool-nairobi.com/contents.php?pageid=3281&amp;parentid=421\" title=\"\">The fees start at $1,700 a term</a> for the youngest day pupils, placing Gems in the upper-middle bracket for private schools in Nairobi. Raminder Vig, Gems' chief academic officer for Africa, admits such an education will be out of reach for most Kenyans. But he says the school is more than just another resource for Nairobi's elite, who send their children to private schools, whether international or Kenyan.</p> <p>Gems plans to construct cheaper schools in Kenya and is rebuilding 16 classrooms in the Kibera slum, while the Varkey <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/unesco_and_varkey_gems_foundation_launch_principals_training_programme_that_will_impact_10_million_children/\" title=\"\">Gems Foundation has partnered with Unesco to train 10,000 headteachers</a> in Ghana, Kenya and India between 2012 and 2015. \"We have a whole wealth of experience to support that aspect,\" says Vig. \"Every expat teacher we take on, we take a local teacher as well for the training element.\"</p> <p>Lack of training and good management is a problem in Kenyan state schools, says Professor Joseph Massaquoi, director of the <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/\" title=\"\">Unesco Nairobi office</a>. \"We found [teachers] did not have training but were promoted because they had served for a long time,\" he says.</p> <p>John Mugo of <a href=\"http://www.uwezo.net/\" title=\"\">Uwezo, a civil society group</a> that monitors literacy and numeracy in east Africa, says that despite investment in state education, children are failing to acquire basic reading and maths skills. He blames absenteeism, teacher shortages and the quality of teaching.</p> <p>\"A lot of value is placed on the terminal grade \u2026 which means the least motivated teachers \u2013 the oldest, who are tired and waiting for retirement, those who are alcoholics or facing disciplinary action \u2013 are the ones taken to [the lowest classes],\" says Mugo.</p> <p>Teaching philanthropy is an important part of the Gems curriculum although most private schools in Nairobi also run charitable projects, involving the pupils. In an art class, teacher Susan Thomas was showing students how to dye material, which will be used to make scarves in a joint project with a special needs school.</p> <p>Andrew Mbogori, a Kenyan who works for the UN, has two children, aged four and seven, at the new school. He says he was drawn by the facilities. \"I don't think having good private schools here is making the government abscond [sic] on [its] responsibility,\" he says. \"We've seen in the last 10 years that education has taken a turnaround, with lots of government investment. These schools are setting a pace \u2026 in Kenya.\"</p> <p>Vig says Gems plans to open a school in Uganda next September, with another due to start in Tanzania's capital in 2014. Gems is also signing a lease for a school in Ghana, due to open in 2014, and looking at Mozambique and Nigeria. Roberts, who has taught in Pakistan, Libya and Saudi Arabia, says being part of the Gems network allows the school to offer better facilities than competitors.</p> <p>The classrooms are spacious, decorated with a rich array of posters and other learning aids, and all have interactive white boards. In one classroom, a handful of three- and four-year-olds sit on a floor mat, learning their letters. Each child is using an iPad.</p> <p>In the music room, stocked with synthesisers and African drums, five year-eight students from Romania, Kenya and Uganda are learning about pitch, giggling madly as they chant \"I love music\" in squeaky voices.</p> <p>Priyal Bahchu, a 12-year-old Kenyan in a purple T-shirt and pink shorts (uniforms of grey skirts and cream blouses are on the way), wants to be a drummer when she grows up. \"It's different here and there's more support,\" she says. \"I was asked [by my parents] if I wanted to change school. I said I wanted to see this place and I liked it.\"</p> <p>Elzabe Peregrino moved to Nairobi a year ago and has two children, aged nine and 11, at the school. Her girls previously attended a Gems school in Abu Dhabi. \"When we saw it open here, it was an easy decision \u2026 The teaching style is better suited [to my daughters]. They have flourished.\"</p>",
  "<p>Standard Chartered hopes to settle all claims over Iran-linked transactions with US agencies by the end of the year.</p> <p>The bank agreed in August to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/standard-chartered-pay-fine-regulator\" title=\"\">pay New York's banking regulator $340m (\u00a3211m)</a> to settle allegations that it breached US sanctions and hid $250bn of financial transactions with Iran.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/india-first-starbucks-long-queues\" title=\"\">Starbucks has just opened its first store in India</a>, in central Mumbai. Days after the opening, Mumbaikars, mostly the young, were still queuing for up to an hour to grab their Frappuccinos, while madly updating their Facebook statuses. Social commenters are bemused by the lemming-like flood. \"Best coffee? No way. It's all about feeling foreign and upper class,\" sneered one sceptic. \"Two decades after liberalisation, you'd imagine India's young 'uns would be jaded enough to shrug off the entrance of yet another global chain\" <a href=\"http://mumbaiboss.com/2012/10/25/food-review-starbucks/\" title=\"\">mused popular website Mumbai Boss</a>. \"When can you say you went to the opening of the first ever Starbucks?\" tweeted one unabashed groupie.</p> <p>Me, I am somewhere in the middle. Starbucks is not our coffee messiah and deserves no genuflections. True, India is mainly a tea-drinking nation. However, southern India has always had a vibrant coffee culture. For many Indian taste buds, including mine, nothing beats strong frothy \"filter\" coffee from Coorg, India's premier coffee producing area. As one commenter on the Guardian website rightly pointed out, you can get <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/india-first-starbucks-long-queues\" title=\"\">excellent coffee on every street corner</a> for less than a few rupees.</p> <p>However, coffee snobs are missing the point entirely. The Indian yuppie does not want to stand on a street corner, however good the coffee. Most streets here are awash with sewage, garbage and gaping manholes, so why would he or she? Sure, there are also plenty of darshinis and dhabas (basic cafes and teahouses) across India, where you can get excellent coffee or chai for a few rupees, and be in and out in less than 10 minutes. But the potential Starbucks customer doesn't want that. That's what their daddy drank.</p> <p>What he or she wants is a clean, quiet, comfortable, air-conditioned space, to work, meet friends or linger for hours, no questions asked. Such hangouts are scarce in India, and with the urban chaos outside, boy, do we need them. India's women, desperately short of safe public spaces, want to sit by themselves without being leered at, as they might be in dhabas. India has an estimated 200 million people between 18 and 25. The young, who usually live with extended families in cramped houses, want to chat, date and escape their prying parents. The growing number of entrepreneurs who work from home are looking for venues to network and meet clients. And everyone \u2013 absolutely everyone \u2013 will be looking for that scarcest of commodities in India: a clean toilet. It's not about the coffee. It's about the coffee house.</p> <p>Starbucks' biggest competition is the local chain <a href=\"http://www.cafecoffeeday.com/\" title=\"\">Cafe Coffee Day</a>, which has 1,350 cafes across the country. I remember when it set up shop in India 16 years ago. There was no coffee culture then; if you wanted to chat over coffee you had to do it in a posh hotel. \"No one will ever pay 50 rupees (about 57p) for a bad cup of coffee,\" scoffed many sceptics. Well, they could and they did, even as prices soared to 150 rupees or more. Suddenly, for many young Indians, hanging out over coffee became cool.</p> <p>Can Starbucks replicate this? Hard to say for sure, but it's off to a good start by sourcing its coffee locally, in a tie-up with Indian giant Tata Coffee. Much will depend on whether it can set up stores in the right locations, like CCD has done in airports and railway stations. Starbucks has huge brand recall in India. Many of us grew up watching movies like Sleepless in Seattle and shows like Frasier, secretly wishing we too could be rich and thin and sip skinny lattes all day.</p> <p>Is Starbucks elitist? Yes, certainly. Most of India can't afford even 85 rupees for a basic cup of brewed coffee, much less the 200-rupee caramel frappucino. Starbucks can't compete with the darshinis. But then they don't have to. Darshinis and dhabas will flourish, just as they have always done, and so will posh coffee chains. In a nation of one billion, there's room for everyone, so why can't Indians choose for themselves?</p> <p>I plan to brew my first filter coffee of the day at home, as I always have. But I might pop into Starbucks for a second cup with friends or clients. I expect to have plenty of company.</p>",
  "<p>There are almost audible sighs of relief in parts of the Whitehall establishment at today's news that Japanese firm <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/30/hitachi-next-generation-british-nuclear-plants\" title=\"\">Hitachi is set to buy the Horizon nuclear power project from German firms E.ON and RWE</a> \u2013 a slender lifeline to the UK's stalling \"nuclear renaissance\". At the same time, others in Whitehall \u2013 including a worrying number of Conservative ministers \u2013 are driving for a new dash for gas and casting doubt on renewable energy.</p> <p>Ironically, those who are keenest on gas and nuclear tend to also promote the argument that governments should not seek to \"pick winners\" in energy policy. According to this world view, technology choices should be left to the market \u2013 and the key to tackling climate change is sole, or very strong, reliance on a carbon price set by either taxation or an emissions trading scheme. Such views are gaining traction in debates on the UK energy bill and EU renewable energy targets.</p> <p>So the title of a new WWF report, <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/research_centre/?6263\" title=\"\">On Picking Winners: the need for targeted support for renewable energy</a>, is deliberately provocative. The report is written by Rob Gross of Imperial College, one of the UK's leading authorities on energy policy. Gross concludes that the argument:</p> <blockquote> \"that carbon pricing is the only policy we need in order to save the planet \u2026 is so simplistic it is absurd. Renewable energy in particular needs policies that are investment grade. Only then will we get costs down and create a cleaner and more secure energy system.\" </blockquote> <p>Putting a price on carbon undoubtedly has an important role to play \u2013 but Gross concludes that in no way is it sufficient. One problem is that it is unlikely to be politically feasible to set a carbon price at a high enough level to encourage clean, emerging technologies.</p> <p>Instead, a carbon price is much more likely to encourage gas. This may achieve modest emission reductions in the short term but simply switching all the UK's coal power stations for gas ones would leave power sector emissions at around six times the level that they need to be in 2030.</p> <p>But is it sensible for governments to \"pick winners\" by supporting renewable energy technologies? The reality is that governments have always picked winners whether through research and development funding, repeated subsidies and cost write-offs for the nuclear industry, tax breaks for the North Sea oil and gas industry, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shale-gas-tax\" title=\"\">proposed tax breaks for shale gas</a>. Fossil fuels and nuclear power have benefited from subsidies for decades.</p> <p>So the reality is that governments pick winners all of the time. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/23/george-osborne-letter-ed-davey-gas-wind\" title=\"\">George Osborne's determination to turn UK into \"gas hub\"</a> \u2013 and his efforts to undermine renewable energy \u2013 is one clear example.</p> <p>The real question is not whether the government should be \"picking winners\". It is about whether it is backing the right horses. If the UK relies excessively on a carbon price, we will end up locked in to a gas-based energy system, which is bad news for the climate, the consumer and for security of supply. And the apparent faith that nuclear \u2013 now a very mature technology \u2013 will be cheap and reliable this time round flies in the face of historic experience in the UK and globally, and ignores the huge cost over-runs with new nuclear projects under way in Europe.</p> <p>Government forecasts suggest that gas prices are going only one way: up. The UK is becoming increasingly dependent on gas imports, whatever happens with shale gas production. The dramatic increases in consumer bills over the past few years, and again this autumn, have been largely driven by rising wholesale gas prices.</p> <p>Yet the alternative is clear and attractive. The UK has huge renewable energy resources and could be a world leader in the growing global markets for marine renewables, electric vehicles and even carbon capture and storage, bringing in jobs and investment at a time when they are sorely needed. These technologies do not just magically appear fully formed. They need clear policy frameworks to reach a level of maturity where they can compete easily with technologies like gas which, let us not forget, has reaped plenty of subsidies of its own in the past.</p> <p>The cost of technologies such as solar and onshore wind is already falling rapidly, and costs for offshore wind are set to fall dramatically \u2013 provided investors can be confident that they have a clear market and that politicians won't pull the rug out from under them.</p> <p>So our government has a choice. It can listen to the siren voices who speak the language of economic efficiency but who are really more interested in shoring up the future market for gas. Or it can provide stable policies to bring forward investment in renewables and energy efficiency.</p> <p>The benefits? A power sector which is not based on imported and increasingly expensive gas, a booming green economy and \u2013 not least \u2013 we could actually hit our carbon targets.</p> <p>\u2022 Jenny Banks and Keith Allott work for WWF UK</p>",

People are without power, and a few trees are down, but they have homes.</p> <p>In Loch Arbour, a tiny community neighbouring Asbury Park, it's a different story. A row of six houses that once proudly faced out to the Atlantic has been decimated by the storm.</p> <p>One of the homes, a two-storey wood-panelled building painted pink, is missing almost its entire ground floor. On one side the front wall has been swept away. Inside furniture is entirely missing too, replaced by three feet of sand. The back wall is also gone, with the surge having swept clean through the house and across two gardens behind. The home only has one full supporting wall left and has been cordoned off by police.</p> <p>Bill Gleeson, a funeral home director, owns the home next door. He's lived there with his family since 1986. His home has been more fortunate, most of the walls are intact, although inside there are water marks up to 5ft high in places. The floor is covered in a thick layer of sand.</p> <p>\"The water just washed right through,\" Gleeson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Bill Gleeson's house in Loch Arbour suffered severe damage. 3ft of sand left inside. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23sandy\">#sandy</a> cc @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewwells\">matthewwells</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/4nJdinLt\" title=\"http://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425/photo/1\">twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Adam Gabbatt (@AdamGabbatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt/status/263388826079207425\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-30T21:16:04+00:00\">October 30, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>In Loch Arbour, West Rekeda, 47, manager of Kassin Beach club, also said the ocean \u201ccame right through the building\u201d.</p> <p>The club is closer to the beach than the houses.

He had been planning to hold events in Ohio but will remain at White House.</p> <p>In some ways \u2013 a big way \u2013 the storm is the biggest campaign event of all, an unexpected bonus for Obama. It allows him to appear presidential and casts Mitt Romney in a bit part .</p> <p>The praise from New Jersey governor Chris Christie for Obama over his handling of Sandy has been a big boost. The Romney campaign must be wondering what on earth Christie was thinking. It is one thing to acknowledge help from the White House but did he really have to go far as to describe this as \"outstanding\".</p> <p>Romney is the one on the defensive, reporters watching for whether he appearance at relief event in Ohio veers into campaigning.</p> <p>I spent an hour this morning speaking to Obama campaign workers on the ground in Iowa and other swing states in the Mid-West and West and they are unaffected by Sandy. They are going ahead as normal with campaign plans, stepping up, as scheduled, getting out the votes. This effort will intensify over the weekend, with volunteers working three-hour shifts from 8.00 am on Saturday through to 9pm and from noon to 9pm on Sunday.&#xa0;Predictions among some Obama campaign workers on the ground that Romney has North Carolina in bag, and will take Florida, Virginia and Colorado. Obama, they hope, will take Ohio, Iowa, Nevada and New Hampshire.</p> <p>Mitt Romney is to take a gamble by resuming campaigning on Wednesday. He has scheduled several campaign events in Florida: in Tampa, Coral Gables and Jacksonville. The danger for him is that people might not yet be ready by then to make the switch from focus on the storm to politics, and his speeches on the campaign trail may look petty compared with Obama still dealing with the storm aftermath from the White House.</p> <p><em>Ewen MacAskill in Washington DC</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9b9c90e3-e0fb-455a-b23b-6a335342091f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351615172227/2cbffcf6-7e87-4a88-8e37-9f09b6e4dd8f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama receives an update on the ongoing response to Hurricane Sandy on Tuesday, in the Situation Room of the White House.

At the 72nd street entrance a pair of workmen with a green truck could be seen clearing the road on Central Park drive of tree limbs ripped down by the storm.</p> <p>But the park entrances remained firmly sealed both to traffic and pedestrians, not that it stopped a few hardy \u2013 some might say foolish \u2013 joggers from trying to gain access. Four runners looked around surreptitiously as they squeezed around the metal barrier blocking the road that runs through the park at 79th street.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re idiots, some people just don\u2019t realise they are taking their lives in their own hands,\u201d said a park worker shortly after escorting a sheepish looking jogger over a low wall and onto the pavement of Fifth Avenue. \u201cThere is a lot of damage, a lot of limbs of trees down, and there could still be a lot that come down as the day goes on.

Amongst them were William and Nadine Buffin, from Lyon in France, who had made the trek from their hotel on 32nd street in the hope of finding at least one of New York\u2019s famous tourist attractions open. \u201c We arrived on Sunday and this is not quite what we were expecting,\u201d Mr Buffin said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re supposed to fly home on Thursday \u2013 hopefully, depending on whether the airport is open.\u201d Asked what they planned to do next he said they would probably walk down to China Town. \u201cBut maybe there is nothing open there either\u2026\u201d</p> <p><em>Jamie Wilson</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T16:19:20.427Z\">at 4.19pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508ff675b57986a0fe1d4964\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T15:52:00.554Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tunnels flooded</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <strong>Brooklyn-Battery tunnel</strong>, which connects lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, is completely flooded at its entrance near Battery Park. Water and debris has choked the entrance right up to the tunnel's roof, with flotsam bobbing just beneath a sign warning drivers that the clearance height is 12 ft 7ins.</p> <p>A maintenance truck lies almost entirely submerged on the sliproad down to the tunnel. There was no sign of the water receding in the 20 minutes I spent there.</p> <p>Many buildings in this southernmost part of Manhattan were inundated by the storm surge. Along Water Street, which runs parallel to the East River waterfront, a fire crew surveyed the damage to their station. Windows were smashed and sandbags proved useless against the flow of water. Inside, uniforms were strewn about the floor, which was still damp.</p> <p>Mandatory evacuations were in place in this part of the city, one of the most vulnerable places to a storms surge.</p> <p>The water poured into the entrance to the Whitehall ferry terminal, which provides a connection to Staten Island.</p> <p>An MTA employee told the Guardian that at 7.30am water was \u201cup to the platform\u201d in the terminal. He said some of the tunnels running under the East River from Manhattan to Brooklyn were entirely full of water, from roof to floor. The MTA was unable to pump out water quick enough because equipment was affected by power outages.</p> <p>Most people had heeded the extensive warnings and these streets were largely clear before the storm hit on Monday. But some people were caught out by the severity of the flooding. A new-looking white BMW 3 series car had been carried down a street close to the ferry terminal and dumped askew, partly on the road and partly on the sidewalk. A door had apparently been forced open by the storm, and pools of dank-smelling water had accumulated in the passenger footwells.</p> <p>Most of lower Manhattan below 24th Street was without power Tuesday morning. In Midtown, the damage was less from flooding and more from high winds, with branches and other foliage lining the roads. In some places there had been minor scaffolding collapses and tiles had smashed to the ground.</p> <p>There is a large police presence: squad cars with flashing lights were crawling around Manhattan, although the clean-up operation did not seem to have kicked in by 11am and the police seemed mostly to be reporting damage and acting as reassurance.</p> <p><em>Adam Gabbatt</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ff0efab7-a541-4d26-beb3-e07281a88354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351612279741/95325abd-cb27-487d-9737-475f82845650-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Hurricane Sandy floods reach the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Water reaches the street level of the flooded Battery Park underpass, which leads to the Brooklyn-Battery tunnel in New York.

Riverside Park had a few downed trees, but the inconvenience was more caused by the downed branches, that numerous joggers jumped over as they went for their morning runs.</p> <p>Doormen and supers were hard at work hosing leaves from the sidewalks and curbs in front of their buildings. Some even had the time to put up Halloween decorations in their buildings lobbies.</p> <p>On Broadway, some stores lost their signs, which blew off in the wind.

This morning the man once seen as a likely Republican vice presidential pick has called president Barack Obama \u201coutstanding\u201d and blasted suggestions that his state would make a great photo op for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>New Jersey has been hit hard, three people have lost their lives so far to the storm, 2.4m people are out of power and levees have broken in northern New Jersey leaving at least four towns with up to 6ft of water. And Christie has no time for politics.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say, the administration, the president, himself and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate have been outstanding with us so far,\u201d Christie said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cWe have a great partnership with them.\u201d</p> <p>Obama called on Christie Monday night, the governor said, and offered to help in any way he could. New Jersey has now been declared a major disaster area, opening up government funding for recovery efforts.</p> <p>\u201cI want to thank the president personally for his personal attention to this,\u201d said Christie.</p> <p>On Fox News host Steve Doocy made a pitch for a Christie/Romney photo op in some disaster-stricken New Jersey&#xa0;\u201cOver the last couple of months, you have appeared throughout the country, governor, on behalf of Mitt Romney,\u201d Doocy said. \u201cWe hear that perhaps Mr Romney may do some storm-related events. Is there any possibility that governor Romney may go to New Jersey to tour some of the damage with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested,\u201d Christie snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do here in New Jersey that\u2019s much bigger than presidential politics and I could care less about any of that stuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a job to do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve got 2.4 million people out of power, I\u2019ve got devastation on the shore, I\u2019ve got floods in the northern part of my state.

The rivers are going down. In general the departments have put down the vigilance, it was red, now it is normal. They are trying to repair the roads and bridges that collapsed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said the most serious impact of the storm had been on agriculture - the loss of crops and livestock. Christian Aid was going out at the moment to see what the state and other organisations were not able to provide, \u201cand to provide what is missing\u201d. They would be helping repair houses, replace livestock and provide seeds.</p> <p>Asked about the government\u2019s response, he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To be honest I think this time they did what they could, because they managed to put more than 20,000 people in temporary shelter, but in total you have 200,000 people that were affected by Sandy. That means there is a huge gap. We think we could provide some support to complement what they are doing.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could the government do differently?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Christian Aid [is pushing] the government to take the environment situation more seriously, because if the country had the right trees, the right forests in place, I think that could help. It\u2019s really important for them to prioritise this in their future budget, for example. The Ministry of Environment in Haiti has 0.65% of the budget. I don\u2019t think it is normal. As a priority sector they need to receive more in order to help Haiti have better cover in terms of trees, and that could help us with all these hurricane storms that will come in here.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032480&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Prospery+Raymond+of+Christian+Aid+talks+to+the+Guardian%27s+Paul+Owen&amp;amp;mp3Time=02.11pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032480&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032480-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-prospery-raymond-of-christian-aid-talks-to-the-guardian-s-paul-owen/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508fe1d2b5792d0b94e6eaac\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T14:18:58.992Z\">2.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A video posted to YouTube captures the collapse last night of the <strong>facade of a building</strong> on 8th Ave in NYC.

Plantain trees and plantations ripped down, gardens flooded, and so in a country that primarily supports itself agriculturally, this is an extreme hit to the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>There would now be an increase in food prices and \u201cfood insecurity\u201d, with families finding it more difficult to harvest or sell their crops, she said. This would make it more difficult for them to send their children to school or repair their homes. Flooding and damaged homes were an immediate problem, \u201cbut in the coming months we\u2019re going to be looking at a real severe food security situation\u201d.</p> <p>She was less optimistic than Lisa Laumann of Save the Children (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts#block-508fce92b5792d0b94e6eaa0%20\">see earlier</a>) that the government was well-prepared to deal with this disaster, coming as it does so soon after the 2010 earthquake and Isaac in 2011.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has been active from the very beginning. The national disaster management system has been mobilised early on, and this is a nationwide system. And the government has also been meeting with international organisations to coordinate the response, and has also allocated an additional $800,000 for initial response actions, so they have been very present and very active, but the reality is that they\u2019re stretched in terms of capacity and in terms of ability to respond \u2026</p> <p>The capacity for the government to respond even prior to these storms was starting to diminish. Funding is drying up for cholera response. So, big concern. There\u2019ll need to be a national joint effort with all key stakeholders to respond and to respond swiftly.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;object data=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot; id=&quot;boo_embed_1032437&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;129&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://abfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/swf/fullsize_player.swf&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;scale&quot; value=&quot;noscale&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;salign&quot; value=&quot;lt&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;bgColor&quot; value=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;window&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;FlashVars&quot; value=&quot;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian.mp3%3Fkeyed%3Dtrue%26source%3Dembed&amp;amp;mp3Title=Hurricane+Sandy+in+Haiti%3A+Kristie+van+de+Wetering+of+Tearfund+talks+to+Paul+Owen+of+the+Guardian&amp;amp;mp3Time=01.35pm+30+Oct+2012&amp;amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian&amp;amp;mp3Author=PaulTOwen&amp;amp;rootID=boo_embed_1032437&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: none; display: block; width: 400px; height: 145px;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;allowtransparency&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; hspace=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; vspace=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://audioboo.fm/boos/1032437-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti-kristie-van-de-wetering-of-tearfund-talks-to-paul-owen-of-the-guardian/embed&quot; title=&quot;Audioboo player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4be088ea-7c66-4ebc-90d8-310c0259fef9\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351605351867/5892f225-892b-46fa-822f-1e35d257ffdf-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A resident of Leogane, Haiti makes her way to her home as the water level continues to rise on 26 October 2012.

It went through Cuba, and we were at quite a distance from it. So when it came through it was still quite strong, although it was just a tropical storm. [It was] followed by days of intensive, intensive rain, that Thursday and Friday of last week were just \u2026 I\u2019ve hardly seen so much rain in a long time.</p> <p>It really led to a lot of damage in the country. There\u2019s been a substantial amount of damage to roads, a substantial amount of flooding in agricultural areas raising serious concerns about crops, and then of course with the standing water and the flow of water the increased concern about diaorrhea and disease, particularly cholera.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was reasonably optimistic about the government's ability to deal with these issues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we saw during tropical storm Isaac and I think in tropical storm Sandy as well is a government that is challenged by the recurrent disasters that hit the country but also a government that is increasingly able to deal with this type of disaster. By that I mean that the government has a national system for the management of risks and disaster, and in the last two crises that have hit the country it has taken the lead.</p> </blockquote> <p>Organisations such as her own had \u201cplayed a role in preparation and response\u201d, but increasingly they were working under government leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like I think the government has infinite capacity to respond \u2026 but I think it\u2019s important to recognise that the government does have increasing ability to coordinate and manage disaster preparedness and response here.\u201d</p> <p>Why did so many people die, despite the eye of the storm not hitting Haiti directly?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People die because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time or because the infrastructure is not such that it protects them from incidents that occur. I think if the road infrastructure was stronger in this country, if there were better flood control, fewer people would die in emergencies like these.</p> </blockquote> <p>Laumann was speaking from a high-up area of Port-au-Prince, where there was no standing water, and children were out and off to school. \u201cThere certainly has been damage to some buildings, but it looks from here like a fairly normal day.\u201d</p> <p>But in the camps for those made homeless by the storm \u201cit\u2019s different\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People lost their few assets that they had. They were flooded out \u2026 Life is much more challenging for them. It\u2019s hard when you lose most of your possessions or have them destroyed by a storm.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the south of the country there was a lot of road damage, she said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last damage map that I took a look at showed damage in pretty much every department of the southern part of the country, much worse than the north. When you think about the fact that Haiti is already a road-challenged country, that\u2019s going to make problems for people who need to move around and for people who need to respond. Bridges have been broken, sections of road have been washed out, there\u2019s some land sliding over some of the roads.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-b049e51c-f6ba-45c2-bc8b-89eac47f229b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/30/1351602063625/42cd89c9-da9f-4fd0-a7d3-6298969cdbe3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The interior of a home is flooded after the passing of Hurricane Sandy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Saturday 27 October 2012.

Sandy has taken on the structure of a wintertime low-pressure area, so is no longer a tropical cyclone.</p> <p>The NHC says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The primary difference between a tropical cyclone and a wintertime cyclone is the energy source. Tropical cyclones extract heat from the ocean and grow by releasing that heat in the atmosphere near the storm center. Wintertime cyclones (also called extratropical or frontal <br>lows), on the other hand, get most of their energy from temperature contrasts in the atmosphere, and this energy usually gets distributed over larger areas.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because of these differences, tropical cyclones tend to have more compact wind fields, tend to be more symmetric, and have a well-defined inner core of strong winds. Wintertime lows have strong temperature contrasts or fronts attached to them, have a broader wind field, and more complex distributions of rain or snow.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508f94a795cb55519dae8b43\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-30T08:49:43.874Z\">8.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fire in Queens, New York</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A fire department spokesman has told AP more than 190 firefighters are battling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/30/sandy-superstorm-flooding-power-cuts?commentpage=all#block-508f8bc5b5792d0b94e6ea81\">the blaze in Breezy Point</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.gemseducation.com/\" title=\"\">Gems Education</a>, a private school group operating in 10 countries, is embarking on a major expansion in Africa, attracted by the continent's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/28/african-economic-outlook-2012-youth-unemployment\" title=\"\">strong economic growth</a>. In September, the company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/30/nairobi-private-school-gaps-state-system\" title=\"\">opened its first secondary school in Africa</a> in Nairobi, Kenya. Further schools are planned in Nigeria, Uganda, Ghana, Mozambique, Tanzania and South Africa.</p> <p>\"We are excited by Africa; it offers tremendous potential with a growing consumer class,\" said Dino Varkey, group executive director, who was in London for a brief stop on his way to New York from Dubai, where the company is based.</p> <p>Gems was founded more than 40 years ago by husband and wife team KS and Mariamma Varkey after they emigrated from Kerala, India to Dubai. Both teachers, they taught the local Emirati and expatriate community before buying their first school in 1968. It had 27 students, three teachers and no air conditioning. Their son, Sunny, is chairman.</p> <p>Gems now has schools in the US, UK, India and China, and has partners that include the <a href=\"http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/\" title=\"\">Clinton Global Initiative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Unesco</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.tonyblairfaithfoundationus.org/\" title=\"\">Tony Blair Faith Foundation</a>. Gems is expanding at a time when demand for private education is growing in the developing world because of government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/16/mdg-education-missed-fears-aid\" title=\"\">underinvestment</a>.</p> <p>According to an <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/efareport/reports/2012-skills/\" title=\"\">education for all global monitoring report</a> published by Unesco in October, 71 million adolescents of lower secondary school age were out of school in 2010, with three out of four living in south and west Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The last of these regions has doubled the number of students enrolling over the period, yet has the world's lowest total secondary enrolment, at 40% in 2010.</p> <p>Private schools have stepped in to plug the gap. In Pakistan, private-sector education has increased from approximately 3% in the early 1980s to 34% today, <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR\" title=\"\">according to the World Bank</a>. Enrolment in private schools is around 13% in Kenya (2010), 22% in Nigeria (2010) and 15% in Ghana (2011).</p> <p>\"Governments on their own cannot meet and fund this demand,\" said Varkey. \"More and more private schools are stepping in outright, or in partnership with governments, to deliver education. Too often it's seen as private v public. It's actually good quality education which is important, and it's whatever works \u2013 private alone, private and public or NGOs.\"</p> <p>The expansion of private schools in the developing world is contentious, however, particularly as inequality has climbed the development agenda. The Unesco report said fees, whether official or unofficial, disproportionately affect young people from poor families, preventing them enrolling and continuing with secondary education. With <a href=\"http://www.gemscambridgeinternationalschool-nairobi.com/contents.php?pageid=3281&amp;parentid=421\" title=\"\">fees starting at $1,700</a> a term, tuition at the Gems school in Nairobi will certainly be out of reach for the poorest people, but Varkey said Gems will seek to have schools that charge less to broaden access.</p> <p>Unesco points out that Rwanda has gone in a different direction to increase secondary school enrolment. In 2009, Rwanda introduced a nine-year basic education cycle and eliminated fees for lower secondary school, which boosted the number of lower secondary students by 25% within a year. In addition, the curriculum was redesigned to focus on fewer core subjects, and a new assessment system was introduced. Kenya has also abolished fees for secondary schools, increasing enrolment from 1.2 million in 2007 to 1.4 million in 2008.</p> <p>Kevin Watkins, a senior fellow at the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/universal-education\" title=\"\">Centre for Universal Education</a>, is deeply sceptical about private schools in Africa. \"The idea that African governments can't afford to deliver decent quality basic education is frankly fatuous,\" he said. \"So is the claim that private-sector providers are more efficient. When you adjust for parental wealth and poverty the learning achievement gains evaporate. As it happens, the top performing secondary schools in Kenya are the 'national schools', which happen to be public. Gems schools are geared to provision of high-cost education for Kenya's elite. Doubtless they will provide Mr Varkey and his shareholders with a healthy profit.\"</p> <p>But for Gems, it is full steam ahead. The company plans to have schools in 16 countries by the end of next year and in 41 countries in the next three to five years, an expansion that will mean investment of $550m-650m. Rapid expansion always poses dangers for companies, but Varkey is confident Gems can cope. \"We are structured and geared up for expansion,\" he said. \"In the last seven years we have made sure we have the underlying infrastructure for expansion. We can handle 25-40 new schools a year if we needed to, but the big constraint is capital.\"</p>",
  "<p>As I write this, Hurricane Sandy's minimum central pressure has dropped to <a href=\"http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT3+shtml/291439.shtml\">a stunning 940 millibars</a>, meaning that air is rising in this storm in a way <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_Hurricane_Scale\">similar to a Category 4 hurricane</a>.

You have to be careful, given that a Category 1 hurricane in October is not itself unusual\u2014and what's really unique about Sandy is its <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/hurricane-sandy-may-be-unprecedented-in-east-coast-storm-history/2012/10/26/4f6660e6-1f6e-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_blog.html\">collision with another, extratropical or winter storm system</a>. Still, there is much that can be said here, even though scientists are careful to emphasize the remaining uncertainties:</p> <p><strong>1. Precipitation: </strong>Scientists agree that global warming has added <a href=\"http://www.int-res.com/articles/cr_oa/c047p123.pdf\">more moisture to the atmosphere</a>, such that for any storm event, including Sandy, there will be more precipitation as a consequence. And excess rainfall is one of the top three sources of hurricane damage (the others being wind and storm surge). Explains meteorologist Greg Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research: \"I have no equivocation in saying that all heavy rainfall events, including this one, have an element of climate change in them, and the level of that contribution will increase in the future.\"</p> <p><strong>2. Storm surge: </strong>Something similar can be said for Sandy's storm surge, which will cause damage across a large area of the northeastern US coast and threatens to flood the New York City subway system. There's no doubt that global warming has <a href=\"http://news.discovery.com/earth/sea-level-rise-endangers-east-coast-120626.html\">raised the sea level</a>, meaning that every hurricane\u2014including Sandy\u2014surfs atop a higher ocean and can penetrate further inland. Indeed, this is true virtually by definition.</p> <p><strong>3. Ocean temperatures:</strong> As meteorologist Angela Fritz <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2276\">observes</a>, sea surface temperatures off the Mid-Atlantic coast were near a record high in September, and 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit above the long term average. In fact, averaged across the globe, ocean temperatures in September were the <a href=\"http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2012/9\">second highest on record</a>, surpassed only by 2003\u2014and with much of the excess heat occurring in the Atlantic region.</p> <p>Warm oceans are jet fuel for hurricanes, so it's fair to say that these warmer temperatures are revving Sandy's engine. And while many factors shape sea surface temperatures in a given place, the overall trend\u2014<a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/pip/2012GL051106.shtml\">directly linked</a> to climate change\u2014is toward hotter oceans. Thus, while Sandy's particular path could be considered a matter of chance, the warm temperatures beneath it allows the storm to be stronger, for longer, than it might otherwise have been. And global warming is creating a world where, on average, those warm temperatures will be there more often than they were in the past.</p> <p><strong>4. Massive size: </strong>The most striking and destructive aspect of Sandy is its breadth\u2014tropical-storm-force winds reached a radius of 520 nautical miles at one point yesterday.<a href=\"#correction\">*</a> Apparently <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2012/1028/Hurricane-Sandy-is-already-setting-records-video\">only one storm</a> in the Atlantic region has had a larger wind field, and of course, <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/surge_details.asp\">bigger storms drive bigger storm surges</a> and damage larger areas when they make landfall. So is global warming involved in making storms bigger, overall? According to MIT hurricane expert Kerry Emanuel, it might be\u2014but probably only a little. \"For ordinary hurricanes, we actually expect a little increase in the size, based upon recent work we've done,\" Emanuel explains. \"Not spectacular, but a little increase in size.\"</p> <p><strong>5. Hybrid storms and climate change</strong><strong>:</strong> Sandy, continues Emanuel, is a \"hybrid storm\"\u2014in other words, it has characteristics of tropical cyclones (hurricanes) that get their energy from the warm ocean surface, but also of winter cyclones that get their energy from temperature contrasts in the atmosphere.&#xa0;Such hybrids do occur around the world with some regularity, but how is global warming changing them? That's less clear, Emanuel remarks.&#xa0;Unlike for hurricanes, \"nobody has bothered to compile a comprehensive climatology of hybrid storms,\" he says. \"So there's nowhere to go to see the characteristics of these storms changing.\"</p> <p>Caveats notwithstanding, then, when people worry about climate change in relation to Sandy\u2014and wonder why their presidential candidates aren't bringing the matter up\u2014it's hard to say they're misguided in doing so. In a campaign season that has <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/10/why-no-one-said-c-word-debates\">studiously avoided the \"C\" word</a>, Sandy reminds us that eventually, the weather always forces the issue.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;This article first appeared on <a href=\"http://climatedesk.org/\">Climate Desk</a>, one of the Guardian's partners</p>",

Like 'Iago with a blackberry' as the Spectator calls him in the programme itself, he is the government's director of communications whose Machiavellian command of the dark arts of spin is directly drawn from the underworld. Nothing is too low.</p> <p>\"Congratulations on your first confirmed kill,\" he chillingly writes on a card to a junior who ill in hospital goes along with his plot to unseat the leader of the opposition. Out of the box drifts a helium balloon with a picture of the deposed leader sellotaped to it. A perfect blend of malice and slapstick.</p> <p>Watching the programme is also a secret vice of comms people to talk of the programme in hushed tones.</p> <p>A few years ago the subject of The Thick Of It came up in a conversation I had with someone who had worked at the heart of government in the civil service. \"On a good day it was nothing like it,\" the individual said. \"On a bad day it was actually a toned down documentary.\"</p> <p>Yet, part of me thinks people will look back in years to come and find that Malcolm Tucker is a bygone relic. Obsessed with newspaper headlines and able to cajole the priesthood of journalists with bribes and threats.</p> <p>Or maybe the government comms people of the future will be just as frenetic and just as twitchy about public opinion. It's just that it'll be the bloggers and the digital journalists they'll be obsessed about.</p> <p>The fourth series ended with Tucker disgraced, chased by a press pack from a police station after handing himself in to be arrested after he perjured himself at a public enquiry.</p> <p>And Malcolm Tucker, to use a very Malcom Tucker word, 'is damaging'.</p> <p>Why damaging?</p> <p>Because he forms people's warped idea of what a public sector comms person looks like. Which is why he needs to be brought down from grace. It's why he needs to die. Under a bus. Outside parliament. With a single bunch of flowers from his ma in Scotland. Leaving a stack of cracking YouTube clips as his legacy.</p> <p>Comms, like journalism, is a broad church and across it finds all sorts of characters and practices. Yet there is nothing I find in what he does remotely similar to what I do working in an environment that encourages open access to social media and open data.

  "<p>Swiss banking giant UBS is cutting up to 10,000 jobs worldwide as it scales back its investment banking operations.</p> <p>In one of the biggest banking job culls since Lehman Brothers, the axe will fall heavily in London and New York, where UBS's investment banking operations are based. In London, about two-thirds of its 6,500 staff work in investment banking. The rest work in wealth and asset management, which are not affected by the latest cuts.</p> <p>The Zurich-based bank plans to reduce its global headcount from 64,000 to 54,000 in the next three years and said some 2,500 jobs will go in Switzerland. It declined to give further detail. It is winding downits fixed-income activities if they are no longer profitable as a result of new capital rules on riskier busineses introduced since the financial crisis. Some 2,000 front-office staff will lose their jobs, with knock-on effects on supporting roles.</p> <p>A spokesman denied reports on Twitter that some staff cannot get into the London offices beside Liverpool Street station because their passes have stopped working. He said: \"When people arrive they go up in a room and get told by someone from HR.\"</p> <p>According to Bloomberg News, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-30/ubs-plans-10-000-job-cuts-raises-profitability-goal-after-loss.html\" title=\"\">around 100 traders in fixed income in London</a> are being put on special leave. They are being sent home on full pay as the consultation process for their departure begins.</p> <p>The restructuring is expected to deliver savings of \u00a33.5bn by 2015.</p> <p>Chief executive Sergio Ermotti said: \"This decision has been a difficult one, particularly in a business such as ours that is all about its people. Some reductions will result from natural attrition and we will take whatever measures we can to mitigate the overall effect. Throughout the process we will ensure that our people will be supported and treated with care.\"</p> <p>The news came as UBS posted a loss of \u00a31.4bn for three months to September, compared with a profit of \u00a3670m a year ago. The bank took a one-off charge of \u00a32bn linked to the restructuring of its investment banking division and a debt-related charge of \u00a3574m.</p> <p>It wants to focus on its private bank and leave other business lines, mainly in fixed income. The Swiss bank said these divisions had been \"rendered uneconomical by changes in regulation and market developments\".</p> <p>The remaining investment bank operations - equities, foreign exchange trading, corporate advice, and precious metals trading - will be run by Andrea Orcel, a recent Ermotti hire from Bank of America.</p> <p>\"The net impact of all these changes will be transformational for the firm,\" chairman Axel Weber and Ermotti told shareholders in a letter. \"Our overall earnings should be less volatile, more consistent and of higher quality.\"</p> <p>Profits slid 40% to \u00a31.5bn in the first six months of the year. UBS said in July that the botched stock market listing of Facebook cost it \u00a3227m. It blamed the loss on Nasdaq's \"gross mishandling\" of the flotation, which involved a series of technical errors that caused a delay in the start of trading of Facebook shares in May.</p> <p>Former UBS investment banker Kweku Adoboli, who is accused of almost sinking the bank with illicit dealing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/29/kweku-adoboli-rogue-trader-denial\" title=\"\">denied on Monday that he had been a rogue trader</a> when he lost the bank \u00a31.4bn. He said other members of his team knew about his \"off book\" activities. The 32-year-old is currently on trial at Southwark crown court in London, accused of gambling away the money while working for UBS during the global financial crisis.</p>",
  "<p>Climate change protesters perched 91m (300ft) up two power station towers have repeated promises to stay for as long as possible, in spite of derisive criticism from the local Labour MP and police estimates that local taxpayers could be hit for \u00a3200,000 costs.</p> <p>The two occupying groups from <a href=\"http://www.nodashforgas.org.uk/\" title=\"\">No Dash for Gas</a> are planning to fly kites in a stiff, chilly breeze from the water cooling towers at West Burton in north Nottinghamshire <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">which has been targeted as one of the UK's new generation of gas-fired power plants</a>.</p> <p>The owners and operators EDF have temporarily closed down the \u00a3600m generator, which has been undergoing tests before starting supplies to the national grid. Consumers have not been affected and vast plumes of steam continue to pour from the adjacent coal-fired power station built in the late 1960s by the Labour government of Harold Wilson.</p> <p>The main group of 11 protesters whose base is a tarpaulin-wrapped tent on the central of the plant's three towers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nodashforgas/status/263178115939958784\" title=\"\">tweeted that more police had come on to the site</a> with loudspeakers to communicate with the group. Campaigners are taking turns to occupy a platform dangling inside the chimney flue, to prevent restarting of operations, while a further six protesters are on the second chimney, which is not yet fully constructed or operational.</p> <p>Ewa Jasiewicz, one of the activists at the top of the tower, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/why-occupying-gas-fired-power-station\" title=\"\">wrote in the Guardian on Monday</a>: \"We're doing this because the gas plant, which is still being constructed by its operator, EDF, is one of the first in a new dash for gas that has to be stopped. The government and the big energy companies want to build as many as 20 new gas power stations, which would leave the UK dependent on this highly polluting and increasingly expensive fuel for decades to come.\"</p> <p>Nottinghamshire police warned that the groups could expect to be arrested, like five women from Leeds and Manchester who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">were caught on the ground at the plant early on Monday morning</a> when the alarm was sounded. The groups say that they entered through a gap in fencing without causing damage at around 1.20am. Local people were woken by a police helicopter using a searchlight at about 4am.</p> <p>The protesters took up a wide range of equipment including a solar panel and wind-up generator to make their own power. They also have a portable toilet and food supplies for at least a week \u2013 fuelling concern about the protest's cost to public funds.</p> <p>John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, twice castigated the group, first as southerners who \"should clear off back down south\" and then as \"city dwellers from Leeds and Manchester\" when the origins of most of them were tweeted back from the chimney top. He accused them of driving to the site in carbon-emitting cars and wasting potentially \u00a3250,000 \"that could have been spent on positive environmental initiatives such as solar panels and ground source heating for pensioner bungalows.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qYrhdhLdAOc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qYrhdhLdAOc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br>Paul Broadbent, assistant chief constable of Nottinghamshire police, <a href=\"http://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/newsandevents/news/2012/october/29/power_station_protest_comes_at_a_cost/\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"We have no choice but to police the protest, to try and bring it to a successful and swift conclusion and to ensure that everyone's safety at the power station is protected \u2013 including that of the protesters.</p> <p>\"That is already proving a drain on police resources \u2013 and if the current staffing levels are maintained day and night for the next week, that will cost in the region of \u00a3200,000 \u2013 excluding petrol, overtime payments, and other factors.</p> <p>\"Of course people have a legal right to protest \u2013 but they must do that lawfully. In trespassing into the power station, scaling chimneys and effectively taking up residency, the demonstrators have acted illegally. There are 101 ways to protest lawfully but breaking into someone else's property is not one of them.</p> <p>\"I make no comment on the motivation, or cause, of those taking part in the protest. But I do wonder whether the tax payers of Nottinghamshire would want scarce police resources to be occupied in policing this protest.\"</p> <p>A spokeswoman for No Dash for Gas said that the occupying groups were in regular touch with the police and had made it clear that they would hand themselves in when they came down. She said: \"We don't see any need for an expensive police operation. It isn't as if they are wanting to escape or anything. They have acted responsibly throughout and will carry on that way, giving themselves up when they feel the protest has gone on for long enough.\"</p> <p>Some of the protesters have belayed on to the roof of a nearby building to get an easier position to launch the kite which they hope to use to link the two occupied chimneys. The ingenuity of the operation has attracted quite a lot of local interest and although the chimneys are hard to approach even by public footpaths, the image of protesters crossing two and fro on an overhead line has obvious attractions for a protest designed to draw public attention to climate change issues.</p> <p>Speaking from the central chimney, one of the group said: \"We're hoping we'll be able to go too and fro but we'll have to see how the kite works.\" He also added his voice to claims that large-scale policing was not necessary. He said: \"We've no intention of trying to run away when we come down and we are not going to carry out any criminal damage here whatsoever. They could put a couple of officers at the bottom of each chimney and that would be enough.</p> <p>\"We have not yet decided among ourselves how long we should stay up here, but we are discussing that and we will let the police know as soon as we do.\"</p> <p>A statement from EDF said that security had been increased following the \"planned and deliberate act of trespass\" and joined police in calling for the occupying groups to come down. The company said that the plant's Unit 2 which uses the central chimney had been generating 280 megawatts as part of commissioning tests but had been shut down immediately to prevent the protesters coming to any harm. The other two chimneys are not yet operational and production at the next-door coal-fired power station continues as normal.</p> <p>The company said on the underlying issues: \"As part of our sustainability commitments, we aim to reduce the carbon intensity of our generation by 60% by 2020 from a 2006 base. Alongside our new gas plant at West Burton playing a contribution to the country's balanced energy mix, new nuclear and renewables are major elements in our future generation investment plans. EDF Energy has plans to build up to four new nuclear plants in the UK which could provide low carbon electricity for up to 40% of Britain's households, We are also the country's largest generator of low carbon electricity through its existing nuclear and renewables fleet.</p> <p>\"On profits and investment, our earnings before tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was \u00a31.6bn last year. Over \u00a31bn was invested in our generation fleet, new generation capacity, gas storage and our customer supply business; and the remaining \u00a3600m went to pay our income tax, interest on our debt, the deficit repair payment on our pension schemes and other similar commitments.\"</p> <p>The five women arrested in the plant on Monday on suspicion of aggravated trespass have been released on bail pending further inquiries.</p>",
  "<p>After watching media mass hysteria over hurricane Sandy on CNN for a chunk of the evening I went to bed on Monday night uncertain whether New York would still be with us by breakfast time. Yo, Big Apple, glad to wake up and find <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-new-york-live-blog\" title=\"\">you very wet but still more or less in one piece</a>.</p> <p>I'm not sure about CNN's reputation being intact in our house though. I don't often watch the channel much these days, but even with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Amanpour\" title=\"\">Christiane Amanpour</a> \u2013 she's a veteran war correspondent and grownup \u2013 in charge of coverage of \"the monster storm from hell\", the output was completely over the top. It's the sort of occasion when the only experts being consulted sounded like the OTT variety. And, no, little or no climatic context was provided.</p> <p>By comparison, BBC1's Six O'Clock News, which only devoted its first five minutes or so to something that hadn't actually happened to the US eastern seaboard yet \u2013 and didn't live up to its billing when it did, peaking a few hours later \u2013 was a model of reticence. As ever Radio 4 is both calmer and more informative. All those misleading pictures often get in the way.</p> <p>I won't be back on CNN in a hurry, which is worrying \u2013 and not just for CNN either because intense competition between rival media in search of readers and viewers leads to hype and hysteria which must put off many customers. Even those in search of lurid sensation go off in search of even dafter novelty when they tire of waiting to see if CNN's intrepid reporter in storm-torn Atlantic City \u2013 his name was Ali \u2013 would be picked up by the wind and blown into the sea (or the \"literal Niagara Falls\" as one eyewitness called the ocean).</p> <p>In fairness I should concede that this has been a very big storm and a pretty serious event: 13 deaths, flooding in lower Manhattan, loss of power, evacuation of hospitals and low-lying areas (200,000 New Yorkers live less than four feet above sea level), the closure (every cloud has a silver lining?) of Wall Street.</p> <p>Some 60 million people have been affected in the US alone, solemnly warned by CNN that if they lost their electricity supply, food and medicine in the fridge might perish! I tell you, it's hell out there in the freezer section.</p> <p>It's also right that the authorities should persuade those seriously at risk to take that risk seriously, not least because officialdom knows it will be blamed anyway. Be sensible, stay indoors. People who normally lead safe lives are often not good at risk assessment \u2013 they worry about the wrong thing.</p> <p>As Jonathan Watts reports on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/29/hurricane-sandy-new-york-live-blog\" title=\"\">the Guardian's storm live blog</a>, 69 people died when Sandy devastated the Caribbean, and Haiti was badly hit as usual. Alas, there are few global media corporations or foreign correspondents in Port-au-Prince, less medicine in the fridge too, so it made less of an impact. But Sandy has already been around for 10 days.</p> <p>We all understand how these things work. Extreme weather makes for great TV pictures. There's even a dedicated weather channel out there somewhere, where you can watch hurricanes or snow storms all day if you like. The same pictures of storm-lashed harbours (or if it were riots then burning buildings) come round time after time. Only the dramatic pics are shown. One ends up unsure how serious a crisis has really been.</p> <p>Not everyone sounded as if the end of the world was at hand. Bloomberg News seemed calmer. Mayor Mike Bloomberg (they are related) of New York was a model of calm, as Rudolph Giuliani was in New York's <em>real</em> trauma, the 9/11 attacks \u2013 a benchmark event that should have helped provide the city with perspective.</p> <p>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama both cancelled campaign events. The president returned to the White House and said all the right things. But he looked tired and sounded disengaged. Obama doesn't do empathy well. He was almost as hopeless as his Republican challenger safely above high tide in the mid-west.</p> <p>Since Romney wants to abolish the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency\" title=\"\">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> and leave things to individual states, there may be some advantage for Obama here. He still believes federal government can make a difference. One word \u2013 Katrina \u2013 the hurricane that devastated New Orleans in 2005 when warnings were ignored at local, state and federal level, suggests they need better government to take strategic precautions.</p> <p>Talking of which, the one phrase I didn't once hear on CNN last night \u2013 or on the BBC \u2013 was \"climate change\". In other words, context, the big picture. Climate, not mere weather. Was the scale of hurricane Sandy the product of a warming planet? Some experts say it's a contributory factor.</p> <p>I don't know the answer. That's way beyond my pay scale. What the telly boffins were saying was that its 1,000-mile size was the result of three specific weather events colliding: a traditional Caribbean hurricane, cold air coming down from the north and a high pressure system whose contribution the A-level geographer in me didn't quite understand.</p> <p>Consulting Google College (\"we never close\") this morning, I quickly found <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/29/yes-hurricane-sandy-is-a-good-reason-to-worry-about-climate-change/\" title=\"\">this sensibly tentative analysis</a>, which highlights warmer seas and melting icecaps. Both point to more flooding of port cities located by the sea, as port cities tend to be.</p> <p>There was one passing reference to a thinner icecap at the north pole which I caught on CNN last night. Perhaps the channel carried more when the excitement of the moment had passed. I hope so, not least because New York \u2013 the second most exposed US port after New Orleans \u2013 has apparently been talking about anti-surge barriers for years, but not acted.</p> <p>London of course has had its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Barrier\" title=\"\">Thames Barrier</a>, second in size only to the Dutch big boy, since 1984. It was closed four times in the 1980s, 35 times in the 90s, and 75 times in the first decade of our century. Those wimpy Europeans do get some things right.</p> <p>So Americans should ponder, though I'm not sure if enough of them will do. I heard a US expert this morning \u2013 on the radio of course \u2013 saying that the eastern seaboard had experienced a series of extreme weather events these past 15 months. Hurricane Irene last year, a savage October snowfall \u2013 \"these are things we have not seen before in recorded history\".</p> <p>Quite so. Now I must try to find out what happened to CNN's on-the-spot reporter in Atlantic City. When I last saw Ali he was no longer staggering around a windswept street as if he expected to be whisked into the air. I've reported a US hurricane from a deserted Corpus Christi in Texas. My hurricane was also a media anticlimax \u2013 but they're scary.</p> <p>The city looked calmer and Ali's authority was undermined by three kids dancing in the street behind him. It all looked a bit showbiz, and safely at home behind the Thames Barrier we unkindly wondered whether CNN's commercial sponsors would have asked for their money back if Ali had been swept away during an ad break.</p>",
  "<p>Last week environment secretary, Owen Paterson, put Gallic noses out of joint <a href=\"[http://www.thegrocer.co.uk/opinion/paterson-not-popular-at-sial-after-badger-inspired-no-show/233675.article\">by failing to pitch up in Paris</a>, where he was supposed to be leading a trade delegation <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2221297/Les-rosbifs-coming-Environment-Secretary-Owen-Paterson-leads-Parisian-invasion-sell-British-fromage-fizz-French.html\">to flog British \"fizz and fromage</a>\".

It's been a battle won latterly by Team GB, and we've <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1364381/Sacre-bleu-British-steam-ahead-French-kitchen.html\">exploited every opportunity</a> to remind our neighbours that we're cooking better food than they are.<br><br>Where the battle hasn't been fought so much is on the beaches, in the fields, and in the dairies. I remember AA Gill soliloquising, as is his wont, about French butter at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/amex/london-restaurant-festival-big-debate\">London Restaurant Festival's Big Debate</a> while arguing against the motion that French food was a spent force. Anthony Bourdain also highlights the \"rich, cheesy Normandy butter\" in Kitchen Confidential, and recalls, misty-eyed, the oyster in the Gironde that kindled his obsession with food. Even Nigella, who <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/9604050/Foamy-sauces-and-egotistical-chefs-Nigella-Lawson-gives-withering-verdict-on-French-cuisine.html\">recently referred to France</a> as \"that irritating country you have to drive through to get to Italy\", conceded that their bread and butter were worthy of note.</p> <p>It has always been a given that when it comes to produce the French wipe the floor with us. Their cheeses, meat, seafood, wine and cider have long been far superior to ours. But, stone the crows, British food exports across the channel have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19994411\">doubled since 2000</a>, even before Paterson's big push. The country that gave us roquefort, brie, and la vache qui rit is now buying our stilton and cheddar, guzzling scotch whisky by the hogshead, and even drinking some of our very accomplished <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/culture-lifestyle/food-drink/121005/Britain-champagne-IWSC-sparkling-wine-France\">sparkling wines</a>. Even more surprisingly in this post-BSE landscape, they're also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17925152\">buying our beef</a>.</p> <p>Could it really be that the quality of our produce is outstripping its venerated French counterparts? French food writer and stylist <a href=\"http://valerieberry.com/\">Valerie Berry</a> certainly thinks so. \"There's no comparison. English cheeses are just amazing. I often bring some back to France and my friends are always like 'wow'. Stilton is a unique product, and well above roquefort, I truly believe that. Then there's Wiltshire ham, Gower potatoes, beef \u2013 miles better than charolais or limousin \u2013 I could go on.\"</p> <p>Nonsense, says Jim Fisher, who runs <a href=\"http://www.cookinfrance.com/\">Cook in France</a> in the Dordogne. \"The French are so much more in tune with seasonality, as well as being more willing to deal with the icky' bits that Brits avoid. They have much more understanding of the food on their plates and how it got there, and the weather is better.\"</p> <p>Does the food actually taste better, though? \"Definitely, particularly at local markets. In Sarlat you can buy produce that the paysan has pulled out of the ground that very morning.\"</p> <p>It's a familiar story but it's less and less convincing. While in the UK farmers' markets continue to multiply, in France they are being <a href=\"http://ecosalon.com/the-decline-of-the-french-farmers-market/\">infested by pragmatic wholesalers</a> who know that, ultimately, nobody is going to notice if the leek they are eating came from the next farm or the next country.</p> <p>And if reports are to be believed, that next country is increasingly likely to be the UK. Whether or not this spike in exports is merely down to a surge in expats is really neither here nor there. We've shown that we can cook better food than our neighbours, now it's time we appreciated that we can produce better too.</p>",
  "<p>Branston Pickle is being sold to a 200-year-old Japanese vinegar manufacturer for \u00a392.5m, in the latest deal involving an Asian food business and a British household brand.</p> <p>Branston will join Sarson's and Weetabix in foreign ownership once the deal with Mizkan Group is completed. It will be the second transaction between Mizkan and Premier this year after the Japanese company <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/15/sarsons-vinegar-sold-japan-mizkan-premier\" title=\"\">bought the Sarson's, Haywards pickled onion and Dufrais vinegar brands in June</a> \u2013 a month after a Chinese firm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/03/chinese-food-firm-wolfs-down-weetabix\" title=\"\">bought a majority stake in Weetabix</a>.</p> <p>Kazuhide Matazaemon Nakano VIII, Mizkan's chief executive, indicated that Branston and Sarson's have not been bought as potential entrants into the Japanese food market. Japan's industrial base has been hit by the high price of the yen and domestic manufacturers have targeted foreign expansion in a bid to keep costs down, as well as using their strong currency to pursue takeovers abroad.</p> <p>\"Branston Sweet Pickle is an iconic brand that has established a market leading position,\" said the Mizkan boss. \"The Branston brand is also an excellent strategic fit with our global portfolio and adds to our solid foundation for growth in the UK.\"</p> <p>The deal includes the Branston sweet pickle, ketchup, salad cream and mayonnaise brands as well as the company's factory at Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, which employs 365 people. Premier said it expected \"all employees\" to transfer to Mizkan once the deal is completed in early 2013.</p> <p>The deal means that Premier has exceeded its 2014 target of \u00a3330m in disposal proceeds more than a year ahead of schedule and puts less pressure on the group to sell other brands such as Angel Delight and Bird's custard. Premier had agreed the sales target with banks as part of a refinancing of its debt burden, which stood at \u00a31.4bn earlier in the year and will now be reduced to less than \u00a31bn.</p> <p>Michael Clarke, Premier's chief executive, who joined the group last year from Kraft, is focusing the business on eight \"power brands\" including Oxo, Batchelor's, Bisto, Ambrosia and Mr Kipling. Clarke signalled that Premier will now tackle its bread business, whose brands include Hovis and Mother's Pride but is facing industry-wide problems such as high wheat prices, significant logistics costs and aggressive supermarket pricing. A disposal of the bread business, where Hovis is one of the \"power brands\", has not been ruled out.</p>",

We are still far from that kind of prognosis. In the interim, screening doesn't just save lives, it saves money.

  "<p>The Catholic condemnation of abortion and the death penalty is well known and understood. But Catholic doctrine also condemns unfettered capitalism. We offer here a list of principles of Catholic social doctrine \u2013 not to argue their priority over others \u2013 but because we judge these to be the most in danger of being ignored or distorted in contemporary public debate.</p> <p>The Catholic view of the human person is social not individual. Congressman Paul Ryan has stated that he learned from Ayn Rand to view all policy questions as a \"fight of individualism versus collectivism\". The Catholic church does not espouse \"individualism\" but rather sees it as an error as destructive as collectivism. Blessed John Paul II described \"individualism\" as a dimension of the \"culture of death\" arising from an \"eclipse of the sense of God\". The human person is \"by its innermost nature, a social being\". We are radically dependent upon and responsible for one another. Again, in the words of John Paul II: \"We are all really responsible for all.\" This truth of the human person is tied to the central doctrines of the church. It reflects the very \"intimate life of God, one God in three persons\".</p> <p>Government has an essential role to play in protecting and promoting the common good. The error of individualism leads to a mistaken understanding of the role of government. For too long politicians have echoed Ronald Reagan's misleading mantra \"government is the problem\". The Catholic church, on the contrary, because of its social understanding of the human person, considers government to be as \"necessary\" for human nature as the family. The state exists to \"defend and promote the common good of civil society, its citizens, and intermediate bodies\". Thus, while the church does not offer a specific blueprint for policy, it does view our government's action on behalf of the common good a positive good in itself.</p> <p>Catholic apologists for small government repeatedly invoke a single paragraph from John Paul II's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centesimus_Annus\" title=\"\">Centesimus Annus</a> which cautions against the excesses of a \"social assistance state\" ignoring the decades-long papal consensus supporting social insurance and welfare systems. In the same document, John Paul described the \"intervention of governmental authority\" on behalf of the defenceless as \"an elementary principle of sound political organisation\" taught by the church for a century. John Paul later stated \"one can only rejoice\" that \"states set up social welfare systems to assist families \u2026 and pension funds for retirees\". These express a sense of national \"responsibility\" and \"solidarity\".</p> <p>The doctrine of subsidiarity both limits government and demands that it act when local communities cannot solve problems on their own. Subsidiarity has both negative and positive dimensions. Negatively, it limits overreach by government (as well as other large organisations, including corporations). Positively, the concept (which means \"help\" or \"assistance\") requires that government act when problems cannot be solved on the local level.</p> <p>Ryan has invoked subsidiarity to justify devolving management of Medicaid to states thereby ending centralisation \"in the hands of federal bureaucrats\". At the same time, his budget cuts Medicaid by $750bn over 10 years, a policy that will <a href=\"http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/8185.pdf\" title=\"\">cut healthcare for an estimated 14 to 27 million Medicaid recipients</a>.</p> <p>The broader outlines of the budget plan will radically reduce the size of government and consequently cut funding for private and religious safety net providers such as Catholic charities who depend upon federal grants and contracts for much of their funding. This fails the positive obligation under subsidiarity to render needed assistance.</p> <p>The \"preferential option for the poor\" demands both individual and collective action, including the acts of the state. In the words of John Paul II, the preferential option for the poor affects \"our daily life as well as our decisions in the political and economic fields\"; placing demands upon individuals as well as \"leaders of nations\".</p> <p>The portrayal of the Last Judgment in the Gospel of Matthew is a judgment of the nations based on how they treat the \"least of these\". This was the \"central moral measure\" applied by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops <a href=\"http://www.usccb.org/news/2012/12-063.cfm\" title=\"\">in its evaluation of the Ryan budget</a>. \"The needs of those who are hungry and homeless, without work or in poverty should come first.\"</p> <p>Ryan, like Rand, sees \"dependency\" as our most serious problem. Thus, <a href=\"http://blogs.cbn.com/thebrodyfile/archive/2012/04/10/only-on-brody-file-paul-ryan-says-his-catholic-faith.aspx\" title=\"\">he describes his understanding of preferential option as</a> \"don't keep people poor, don't make people dependent on government so that they stay stuck at their station in life\".</p> <p>It should go without saying that poverty is not caused primarily by a too generous government safety net that becomes, in Ryan's words, \"a hammock that lulls able-bodied citizens into lives of complacency and dependency\". It is much easier to cut government programmes than to help people out of long-term poverty as the <a href=\"http://www.npc.umich.edu/publications/policy_briefs/brief28/policybrief28.pdf\" title=\"\">very mixed results of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act</a> prove. Ryan's 2012 budget achieves 62% of its designated savings from cuts to programmes for low-income families and individuals <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3723\" title=\"\">while cutting the top marginal tax rate and the corporate tax rate</a>. It is impossible to justify this as a serious exercise of the preferential option for the poor.</p> <p>Economic forces must be reckoned among any serious account of the threats to society and human dignity. Ryan's budget resolutions speak mainly of overbearing government and free individuals acting in a private sector whose justice is never questioned. It is hard to reconcile this vision with the history of the past 40 years, in which globalisation has deindustrialised America and deregulation has increased the power of private corporations. At the same time, unions, which official Catholic teaching has long recognised as indispensible to the rights of workers and the common good, have been severely weakened. Whatever the threat of government power, any adequate response to our challenges must address the facts of economic power as well. Modern papal social doctrine has addressed both threats since its inception.</p> <p>In Caritas in Veritate, Pope Benedict XVI has offered an analysis more probing than that offered by either political party. Benedict speaks of the loss of state power in the face of globalisation and calls for the development of new forms of government engagement:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In our own day, the state finds itself having to address the limitations to its sovereignty imposed by the new context of international trade and finance, which \u2026 has altered the political power of states\u2026 [T]heir powers \u2026 need to be prudently reviewed and remodelled so as to enable them, perhaps through new forms of engagement, to address the challenges of today's world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Benedict continues the century-long papal teaching that the market alone cannot address the needs of the common good:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Economic activity cannot solve all social problems through the simple application of commercial logic. This needs to be directed towards the pursuit of the common good, for which the political community in particular must also take responsibility. Therefore, it must be borne in mind that grave imbalances are produced when economic action, conceived merely as an engine for wealth creation, is detached from political action, conceived as a means for pursuing justice through redistribution.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Benedict offers a description of the temptation to reduce the social safety net that reads like an analysis of the Ryan budget:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"From the social point of view, systems of protection and welfare \u2026 are finding it hard and could find it even harder in the future to pursue their goals of true social justice in today's profoundly changed environment \u2026 [T]he market has prompted new forms of competition between states as they seek to attract foreign businesses\u2026 These processes have led to a downsizing of social security systems as the price to be paid for seeking greater competitive advantage in the global market, with consequent grave danger for the rights of workers, for fundamental human rights and for the solidarity associated with the traditional forms of the social state. Systems of social security can lose the capacity to carry out their task, both in emerging countries and in those that were among the earliest to develop, as well as in poor countries. Here budgetary policies, with cuts in social spending often made under pressure from international financial institutions, can leave citizens powerless in the face of old and new risks.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The momentous challenges facing our nation cry out for the full wisdom of the church's social doctrine. We live at time when the social indifference of libertarian thought is achieving broad cultural legitimacy and political power. This vision of the human person and society are fundamentally at odds with the Gospel and the principles of Catholic social doctrine. Legitimate disagreements with the Obama administration must not lead the church to edit the fullness of its teachings for political expediency. Our political obligations as Catholics go beyond choosing a candidate for which to vote. To be truly prophetic, the church \u2013 bishops, clergy and lay faithful \u2013 must proclaim the fullness of its message to all parties, movements, and powers.</p> <p>\u2022 This is an edited version of a document signed by 157 American Catholic intellectuals.

  "<p>The UK government's transparency<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/oct/15/live-discussion-open-government-partnership\" title=\"\"> commitments</a> and its leadership of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) are commendable. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/oct/17/open-government-data-pdfs?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Steps to improve</a> transparency and public services delivery are always welcome.</p> <p>However, some transparency commitments are more politically difficult than others. And it's the difficult ones that, so far, are still not appearing in the government's agenda for the OGP.</p> <p>Take, for example, transparency around the beneficial ownership of companies. One reason why treasuries around the world are continually deprived of billions in taxes is the rampant hiding of who really benefits from owning companies, particularly holding companies.</p> <p>It's a problem that the inter-governmental <a href=\"http://www.fatf-gafi.org/\" title=\"\">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a> has long been trying to solve. The task force recommends that countries should require financial institutions to know the identity of beneficial owners, before or during the course of establishing a business relationship with corporate customers.</p> <p>Country-by-country reporting is another key transparency reform that the government is still not championing. It would require companies engaged in cross-border business \u2013 everything from oil and gas, mining and forestry to banking \u2013 to report their finances separately for each country in which they operate. By knowing more about multinationals' sales, purchasing, hiring and other activities within their borders, governments in poor but resource-rich countries could significantly improve their tax revenues. They could also move out of dependence on aid.</p> <p>The government should also prioritise open contracting. Financial transparency is of limited use if people are unable to assess the deals that governments cut with companies, such as public procurement from G4S and the tenders involving Virgin and FirstGroup. MPs should at least be able to assess the deals their government is cutting with international companies.</p> <p>Transparency reforms such as these are politically difficult, but in the longer term they may unlock the cash needed to improve public services across the world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/21/global-elite-tax-offshore-economy\" title=\"\">The Tax Justice Network has pointed out that </a> \u00a313trillion-\u00a321trillion in untaxed private wealth is sloshing around the global financial system, hidden in tax havens. The sums are staggering: \u00a320tn deposited in banks earn about 5% interest a year, or \u00a31tn.</p> <p>If governments could tax just this interest income at 25%, it would raise revenues of \u00a3250bn each year \u2013 enough to pay for the millennium development goals, stabilise food prices, create jobs, resolve the global financial crisis \u2013 and so on. <a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/february2009/ChristianAid-tax-justice-campaign.aspx\" title=\"\">Christian Aid's own calculations show</a> that developing countries lose about \u00a3100bn a year to tax dodging by multinational corporations alone.</p> <p>The bottom line is that there are vast resources within governments' reach. The means of grasping them are already known \u2013 but politically difficult.</p> <p>The Cabinet Office may very well take the lead in finally pushing through these transparency reforms. It could support the introduction of legislation to require the collection of information on the beneficial ownership of companies, as well as country-by-country reporting in the OGP countries. It could also call on British overseas territories and Crown dependencies to publish their company registers. And it could include language on open contracting in its OGP action plans.</p> <p>It will be a mistake if a major transparency initiative such as the OGP does not address politically difficult transparency commitments, especially since it could obscure the larger picture on the challenges to public services delivery.</p> <p><em>Eric Gutierrez is the senior governance adviser at Christian Aid</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>When the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Higher Education Network</a> launched, its aim was to marry <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/2011/mar/14/about-guardian-higher-education-network\" title=\"\">insight, advice and best practice</a> from global higher education professionals with Guardian commentary and analysis at a time of unprecedented change and challenge for the sector at large.</p> <p>Eighteen months later and despite familiar narratives of what is (or might be) going wrong in higher education, my editorial inbox is constantly replenished with news of projects and partnerships that are going right. Proof \u2013 if it were needed \u2013 that individual universities, departments and HE professionals (academic, administrative or otherwise) are working harder than ever to ensure excellence in their own institutions.</p> <p>We now look forward to celebrating the very best of those UK projects at the inaugural <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/university-awards\" title=\"\">Guardian University Awards</a>. Launched last month and taking place on the evening of our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education\" title=\"\">Higher Education Summit</a> on 27 February 2013, these awards recognise that UK universities are filled with excellence, creativity and innovation at every level \u2013 all things that get the Guardian stamp of approval.</p> <p>This is not a rankings exercise \u2013 we already host the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/world-university-rankings\" title=\"\">QS World University Rankings</a> on the network. Instead, <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/higher-education-network/2012/sep/11/university-awards-judges\" title=\"\">our judging panel</a> are on the look out for great projects, initiatives and campaigns across <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/2012/aug/24/university-awards-categories\" title=\"\">10 categories</a>: student experience, teaching excellence, outstanding research impact, employability initiative, contribution to local community, commitment to widening participation, university facilities, sustainability project, international strategy and, finally, inspiring leader.</p> <p>This last category will be nominated by the panel and voted for by network readers \u2013 staying true to the open interaction on which this site is predicated. Most exciting to me from an editor's perspective is the Ideas Bank that we will build after the awards: a collection of 30 case studies of all shortlisted and winning entries, hosted on the network as inspiration for our global higher education readership.</p> <p>Taken together, these success stories should give us a new idea of today's university \u2013 and if that isn't knowledge transfer I don't know what is. So remember, remember, the deadline for entries is 5 November.

  "<p>It is the age-old story of counter-revolution: not the restoration of the monarchy kind, but the intellectual kind, as the pendulum of ideas in development thinking swings back from the structuralism of the 1970s left towards the new right of the 1980s.</p> <p>Before we take a look at the nature and substance of this counter-revolution, however, it's worth considering what became of the competing ideas of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/08/us-economist-walt-rostow-development\" title=\"\">modernisation theory</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/22/resource-extraction-colonialism-legacy-poor-countries\" title=\"\">dependency theory</a>.</p> <p>Underdevelopment theorists blamed the advanced countries for exploiting and so creating the poverty of the poor. Modernisation theorists saw the presumed weaknesses of poor societies as the primary barrier to future prosperity. Nonetheless, both approaches focused principally on the interplay of states and markets. As a result, neither fully captured the complex challenges confronting poorer countries at the time.</p> <p>Perhaps the principal upshot of this was what would become known as the \"impasse\" in development studies. This impasse led to considerable and often illuminating debates. But it was perceived by many at the time to symbolise a policy as much as an academic dead end. And, crucially, for a while it ceded the future to those prepared to come forth with bolder, brassier ideas. By the early 80s, that meant the new right.</p> <p>The new right was a broad church. Its ideological home was provided by the governments of Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the US. But its practical levers were the institutions of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/mar/07/china-usa\" title=\"\">Washington Consensus</a> \u2013 the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt, which would later become the World Trade Organisation) \u2013 and its momentum was provided by a more general sense of excitement about what is today (far too pejoratively) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/31/globalisation.simonjeffery\" title=\"\">referred to as globalisation</a>.</p> <p>At the heart of the new right project was a particular constellation of ideas and policies known as neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is often used today as shorthand for any idea that is pro-market and anti-government intervention, but it is actually more specific than this. Above all, it is the harnessing of such policies to support the interests of big business, transnational corporations and finance. It seeks not so much a free market, therefore, as a market free for powerful interests.</p> <p>In terms of development policy, neoliberalism often boiled down to the belief that an intensified globalisation was itself development, the two being inseparable sides of the same virtuous coin. Hence, instead of seeing that poor countries would be best served through appropriate targeted policies (limiting domestic vulnerability to the global market through protectionist measures like tariffs, say, as South Korea was doing), neoliberals claimed that \u2013 since global free markets were both the means and the desired end of development \u2013 the only viable object of development policy was to do whatever necessary to make local markets and societies \"fit\" with the new global imperatives that the rich world's drive to internationalisation was bringing into focus.</p> <p>Accordingly, neoliberal development policy was both radical and abstract and, like all such prescriptions, was to be applied strictly according to the instructions. That usually called for several policies. The local state was to do no more (or rather, no less) than facilitate the conditions for \"market society\". At the same time, all barriers to foreign investment would ideally be pulled down, the domestic labour force would be \"restructured\", industry would be privatised, and the profit motive would become the organising value of social life. This, in short, was the \"trade not aid\" approach to development. Get the market conditions right, went the theory, get that too easily corrupted (if not corrupting) state out of the way, and social justice and human development would follow automatically.</p> <p>Alas, such an uncompromising approach was always likely to come to blows \u2013 if not inflict a few of its own \u2013 in the real world. And for all that neoliberalist development policy may with reason claim to have overcome some of the problems of earlier development approaches \u2013 an overreliance on the state as the main agent of change, say \u2013 it soon become clear it had also ignored their most important lessons. Most neoliberals, for example, were convinced that the structuralism of earlier development economists betrayed an excessively political bent to which their own, more \"scientific\" theories were immune.</p> <p>It was precisely this sort of dogmatism that made neoliberalism itself so much more dangerous than the previous generation of ideas. Too many nations were to witness this at first hand in the 1980s. First via the rather callous settlement to the 1980s debt crisis that neoliberals called for (there could be no mitigating factors for third world debt, they claimed: even debt accrued illegitimately by former leaders for personal gain was to be paid back, plus the interest), then at the hands of the IMF's so-called structural adjustment policies (which frequently used poor countries' existing debt as a lever for drawing yet more market-friendly reforms out of them).</p> <p>Though heavily criticised, neoliberal development theories are still alive and well in the halls of economic and political power today.</p>",
  "<p>Impact assessment and evaluation generally doesn't excite people. Sometimes, when I'm introducing it to the projects I am working with, it feels as if I'm apologising for a drunk uncle at a wedding: \"It kind of has to be here. Sorry about that.\" This needn't be the case. Impact assessment is finding out about the changes that work has made in people's lives. This should be exciting!</p> <p>It's not the \"why\" that's the problem; it's how we're doing it. Measuring project outcomes in isolation is like trying to understand how a duck swims by measuring how far it travels in the water. If you really want to understand things, you have to look below the surface. So here at <a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Nominet Trust</a>, we've been working to find an alternative approach to evaluation.</p> <p>It's inspired by the <a href=\"http://www.globalgiving.co.uk/stories/\" title=\"\">Global Giving Storytelling project </a>and their efforts to measure the effectiveness of donations through generating community feedback using an approach developed by <a href=\"http://cognitive-edge.com/\" title=\"\">Cognitive Edge</a>. It aimed to capture the experience of people by asking them to tell stories about their involvement with a project, but uses digital tools to aggregate these stories to give an overall understanding of impact.</p> <p>There's been a lot of interest in storytelling evaluation over the past few years, but it has faced the consistent challenge of being resource intensive. Rather than maximising the rich source of information available to them, organisations are resigned to creating a few individualised case studies.</p> <p>There's a crucial part to the alternative storytelling approach that addresses this challenge.</p> <p>As well as writing a story or sharing an experience online, people articulate what their story is about within a set framework related to the programme. For example, individuals involved with projects funded by our <a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/how-to-apply/areas-investment/digital-edge\" title=\"\">Digital Edge </a>investment programme write about an experience, but then mark on a scale whether this story is more to do with their health, relationships, or work. This is important because it's not a researcher interpreting the story, but the individual themselves telling you what the story means within a framework that makes sense to them and you. It ensures the meaning is coming from the participant. (Conveniently, it also distributes the most labour intensive part of the analysis work among the participants themselves.) Ideally, this collection is done online, but it could also be done on paper and entered into a web page later if needed.</p> <p>This \"meta\" information, about how people have categorised their story, can then be digitally aggregated to understand trends that are occurring; so, for example, you may have 600 out of 1,000 stories that say they are about health. By having lots of different ways for people to categorise their story \u2013 such as where it happened, who was involved, what it was to do with, and so on \u2013 you can cross-reference different areas to get a really rich picture of what is happening. For example, you can identify stories about health that involve friends, take place in the home, and that feature certain key words.</p> <p>On the communication side, it allows you to gather openly people's experiences on a programme and draw out different themes to communicate impact to different audiences. For example, if you have a funder who is particularly interested in work skills, you can draw out stories related to that area. Crucially, though, you can also go from a big-picture analysis and drill directly down into the individual stories that form that picture.</p> <p>A further benefit of this method is that you can capture information much more frequently than with a traditional survey. Asking people to record something that's happened each week is infinitely easier than convincing them to fill out another questionnaire.</p> <p>Using this approach requires a slightly different mindset. Instead of looking for ways to \"prove\" x or y has happened, it offers a means to create a continual feedback loop where information is flowing in to help adjust delivery of programmes as time goes on.</p> <p>The advantage of using technology here is that it allows rich stories of change to be stored, analysed and aggregated much more easily, cheaply and quickly than ever before, joining what happens on the ground to big-picture trends that can share the impact of work with a variety of audiences.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto: developmentresearch@nominettrust.org.uk\" title=\"\">Drop us a line</a> if you'd like to find out more.</p> <p><em>Kieron Kirkland is development research manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.nominettrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Nominet Trust</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Renewable energy capacity will overtake nuclear power in the UK by 2018, if current rates of growth continue, and will provide enough power for one in 10 British homes by 2015, according to new research.</p> <p>The amount of electricity supplied by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wind energy</a> alone is up by a quarter since 2010, in a surprisingly good year for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/25/climate-change-windpower?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">renewables industry</a>. While the government has notably cooled on wind power \u2013 more than 100 Tory MPs signed a statement this year opposing new windfarms, and the chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, has queried the future of subsidies \u2013 the industry has continued to grow, with investment in offshore wind up by about 60% to \u00a31.5bn in the past year. Planning approvals for onshore windfarms also rose, up by about half, to reach a record level, according to the trade association <a href=\"http://www.bwea.com/\" title=\"\">Renewable UK</a>.</p> <p>Despite the outspoken opposition from many Tory MPs against wind power, there was a rise in the amount of onshore wind capacity approved last year for the first time since 2008.</p> <p>Maria McCaffery, chief executive of Renewable UK, said: \"These strong figures underline the importance of a secure trading climate to attract investment, especially in difficult times. That's why it's so important that the framework provided by the energy bill, currently under parliamentary scrutiny, must be right. Although we still have a long way to go to meet our challenging targets, we are firmly on track and gathering momentum.\"</p> <p>John Hayes, the newly appointed Conservative energy minister who has been an outspoken critic of windfarms in the past, told the Guardian he was proud of the UK's wind energy industry. \"Investing in cutting edge technology is very British,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite his past opposition to windfarms, he said he would support new turbines if built in suitable areas. \"It's about having the support of local people \u2013 that is the key thing,\" he said. Measures to make it easier for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/29/community-energy\" title=\"\">local communities to benefit from windfarms</a> \u2013 for instance, by taking a financial stake in the revenues \u2013 are to be brought forward by the coalition government.</p> <p>The energy bill, originally expected to be debated next week, is likely to be delayed until later in November as ministers wrangle over the implications. There is a sharp <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/28/tory-retreat-on-climate-change-senseless?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">split within the Tory party</a> over how to treat renewable energy, as more than 100 of the Conservatives' MPs earlier this year signed a letter opposing new windfarms. Peter Lilley, a vocal climate change sceptic, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/25/green-campaigners-condemn-peter-lilley?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">was appointed to the energy and climate change select committee last week</a> in a move that some saw as an indication of a rightward shift in the government's climate policy. But David Cameron has in the past said renewable energy would be crucial to the UK's future prosperity.</p> <p>Any last-minute changes to the energy bill risk alienating investors. Wind turbine makers are stalling decisions on whether to invest in new manufacturing plants in the UK, pending clarification from the government on its future energy policy. Several large companies, including Siemens, General Electric and Mitsubishi, are pondering building manufacturing plants in the UK, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/27/has-wind-revolution-stalled-in-uk\" title=\"\">will make no decision without firmer assurances from the government</a>. The repeated insistence from Osborne that the UK's energy future lies with the gas industry \u2013 a new \"dash for gas\" is under way, with the government clearing the path for 20 new gas-fired power stations \u2013 has unsettled renewable energy investors. \"The constant talk about gas is not reassuring for us,\" one wind investor, who could not be named, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Renewable UK said that last year there were at least 137,000 people involved in the sector, with a further 654,500 jobs in ancillary industries.</p>"
