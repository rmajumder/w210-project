  "<p>Climate sceptics feature more prominently in newspapers in the US and UK than other countries, and their views are more likely to go unchallenged in right-leaning papers, <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/4/044005/article\" title=\"\">an academic study</a> has shown.</p> <p>Friday's report, which was published in the <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/4/044005/article\" title=\"\">Environmental Research Letters</a> journal, delved deeper into <a href=\"http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/?id=687\" title=\"\">data that was first published last year</a>. For the study, 2,064 newspaper articles from the US, UK, France, China, Brazil and India over two three-month periods in 2007 and 2009-10 were scrutinised for the quantity and type of climate sceptic voices featured on both news and opinion pages.</p> <p>The authors examined in particular the political leanings of each newspaper and concluded that there was \"little evidence\" that this influenced coverage of climate sceptics in Brazil, India and China. However, in the US and UK, and to some extent France, the political leaning of the newspaper did affect coverage of climate sceptics.</p> <p>\"The strongest evidence for a distinction between left-leaning and right-leaning newspapers can be found in the opinion pages in France, the UK and the US, where right-leaning newspapers are much more likely to include uncontested [climate] sceptical voices,\" concluded the authors.</p> <p>There were some surprises in the data, though, said the authors, <a href=\"http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/about/institute-staff/james-painter.html\" title=\"\">James Painter</a> of the University of Oxford's Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (RISJ) and <a href=\"http://open.academia.edu/TeresaAshe\" title=\"\">Teresa Ashe</a> of Birkbeck College. For example, they found that there were slightly more articles of all types \u2013 opinion pieces and news stories \u2013 containing sceptical voices in the left-leaning newspapers from the countries studied, than in the centrist or right-leaning newspapers. But, in the left-leaning papers, the views of climate sceptics were far more frequently countered within an article by an opposing view.</p> <p>The data was first released last year in a report entitled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/nov/11/climate-change-scienceofclimatechange\" title=\"\">Poles Apart</a>, published by the RISJ. It limited its search to two key time periods of climate coverage: the publication of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/02/greenpolitics.ipcc\" title=\"\">the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in 2007</a>, and the release online of the hacked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/hacked-climate-science-emails\" title=\"\">\"Climategate\"</a> emails in late 2009.</p> <p>It also differentiated between three types of climate sceptic featured in the chosen newspapers: the \"trend sceptics\" (who deny the global warming trend); the \"attribution sceptics\" (who accept the trend, but question the contribution of mankind's emissions); and the \"impact sceptics\" (who accept human causation, but claim impacts may be benign or beneficial, or that the models are not robust enough to know).</p> <p>The authors refrained from trying to theorise about why climate sceptic voices featured more frequently in the newspapers published in Anglo-Saxon countries, but did observe that \"the presence of organised sceptical groups or individual climate sceptics in [the US and UK], and their virtual absence in the other four countries, could have been just as important driver of media outcomes as editorial decisions [of newspapers]. They are adept at getting their voices heard in the media when the opportunities arise.\"</p> <p>Painter, the lead author, said: \"These results are significant because they do seem to support those who argue that climate scepticism is much stronger in \"Anglo-Saxon\" countries, such as the US, UK, Canada and Australia, as measured by its presence in the media. The data would also suggest a lot of the uncontested climate scepticism is found not so much in the news reports but in the opinion pages of right-leaning newspapers in the US and the UK.\"</p> <p>Painter added that the study left some intriguing unanswered questions: \"It would be interesting to know what has happened since 2010. Others have reported that climate coverage in the media has fallen since then, but has the incidence of climate sceptics appearing in newspapers remained the same, or even increased proportionately? Also, ideally, a wider range of countries needs to be studied, including the study of countries such as Australia, Canada, Norway and eastern Europe, where climate scepticism is known to be prevalent. There is anecdotal evidence, too, that climate scepticism is now on the rise in the Brazilian media.\"</p> <p>The newspapers chosen for analysis were the Guardian/Observer and the Daily/Sunday Telegraph in the UK, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal in the US, Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo and Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, People's Daily and Beijing Evening News in China, Le Monde and Le Figaro in France, and The Hindu and Times of India in India.</p> <p>Separately, insurance company <a href=\"http://www.axa.com/en/news/2012/climate_risk.aspx\" title=\"\">Axa published a survey</a> on Thursday which showed that a higher proportion of respondents in the UK, US and Japan said they doubted climate science than in the other 10 countries polled, which included Turkey, Indonesia, Germany, and Mexico.</p> <p>More than 13,000 people over the age of 18 were asked in an online survey whether they considered that climate change has now been scientifically proven. \"Even in countries where people are least convinced of the scientific reality of this phenomenon (Japan, UK, the US), [climate] sceptics are in the minority (respectively 42%, 37% and 35%),\" said Axa. Agreement was highest in Indonesia (95%), Hong Kong (89%) and Turkey (86%).</p>",
  "<p>Eight years after it was launched as a Harvard dorm room project, Facebook has declared that its social network is now being used by 1 billion people around the world every month \u2013 or one in seven of the global population.</p> <p>Its founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, 28, is in need of good news after the company's disappointing flotation in May. He took to his personal Facebook account to say that the milestone was \"by far the thing I am most proud of in my life\".</p> <p>He has achieved his stated ambition of reaching 1 billion active monthly users just two years and three months after the social network reached the half-billion mark. Facebook reached 900 million active monthly users in April.</p> <p>With characteristic ambition, Zuckerberg talked of connecting \"the rest of the world\" \u2013 and the company launched a digital video commercial, directed by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, whose film credits include Amores Perros and 21 Grams.</p> <p>Although expected, the announcement will help divert attention from the company's disastrous flotation. Facebook launched at $38 a share in May, only to drop steadily. This week shares were trading at around $21. As a result, Zuckerberg's personal fortune has fallen by about $8bn.</p> <p>Facebook's shares slumped over fears that revenues would be hit by consumers increasingly accessing the internet via mobile devices, which are harder to generate advertising revenue from. About 600 million people use Facebook's mobile platform, and one in 10 reportedly access the site only by phone.</p> <p>Users of the social network have run up 1.13tn \"likes\" \u2013 the internet's ubiquitous thumbs-up button \u2013 140.3bn friend connections and 219bn shared photos since it launched in February 2004. More than 300m photos are uploaded every day and 62.6m songs played, demonstrating how fast the site has become part of people's everyday experience.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are considerable hurdles to overcome if Facebook is to sign up another billion. In North America it is used by nearly 45% of the population, according to data from Socialbakers.com. However, the site has yet to reach more than 6% in Africa, where mobile phones \u2013 fast becoming Facebook's achilles heel \u2013 are predominant, and 7% in Asia, where it competes with local sites.</p> <p>Increasingly, Zuckerberg has taken to travelling the globe to help push the company in new territories. He visited the Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, in Moscow last week, taking part in a TV chatshow and surprising programmers at a local event.</p> <p>The trip was an attempt to help the firm break into the significantRussian market, which is dominated by domestic social network VKontakte, which claims 100 million users. There are similar challenges for Facebook in China, where market rivals RenRen and Sina Weibo have 30 million and 300 million users respectively. It is offering a basic version of the site for users in developing countries including Cameroon, Qatar and Indonesia.</p> <p>But while Facebook is also hoping to lure more subscribers, its real challenge is to raise turnover, even to match Wall Street's reduced expectations. Richard Broughton, head of broadband at analysts Screen Digest, said Facebook is exploring multiple business models to try to boost mobile income.</p> <p>Experiments to boost growth include launching paid posts for individual users, allowing them to pay about $7 (\u00a34.30) to promote their news in their friends' timelines, and discussions with the UK government over using Facebook identities to help citizens access public services.</p> <p>Broughton added that Facebook was finding it harder to make money outside the US, average revenues per user being far higher, about $14, in the States than the $3 in the rest of the world. Facebook's primary sources of income are advertising and payments for features including gaming \u2013 at the time of the float, the Farmville games company Zynga generated about 12% of its revenue.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the analyst warned that growth is slowing: \"When they were initially filing, there were a lot of comparisons to Google, but that was predicated on growth. Now Facebook is plateauing. Social networks are substitutable. You can afford, as a user, to be on several networks. That means there is a reasonably low entry barrier to a competitor coming in.\"</p>",

It was also the first time Cook had been in the driving seat for an Apple presentation \u2013 which for years had been led by Steve Jobs, whose skill at making new products look desirable had become famed as a \"reality distortion field\".</p> <p>But Jobs was at his home nearby in Silicon Valley, gravely ill with neuroendocrine cancer, which had first been diagnosed in 2003, and surgically treated in 2004. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/06/steve-jobs-apple-cofounder-dies\" title=\"\">Jobs died the day after Cook stood on the stage</a>; his death led to a huge \u2013 and, to many, puzzling \u2013 outpouring of grief, and to a more explicable flurry of analyses suggesting that without its co-founder, Apple would wither on the vine.</p> <p>A year on, Apple doesn't look like a company in serious trouble. It has risen in value by more than 75%, from $346.2bn (\u00a3215.2bn) on 4 October last year to $619.9bn at the time of writing, becoming <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/20/apple-most-valuable-firm-facebook\" title=\"\">the most valuable listed company in the world</a> and bringing it close to an all-time inflation-adjusted record (beaten only by Microsoft in 1999). It has sold more iPhones in that period than ever before (and then bettered that with pre-orders for the iPhone 5, which was released last month). Its profits have kept growing, in apparent defiance of any law of economic gravity.</p> <p>\"I never viewed my role as to replace him,\" Cook told the AllThingsDigital conference in May. \"Steve was an original. I don't think another one of those is being made. I never felt the weight of being Steve.\"</p> <p>But is Apple really the same company without Jobs and with Cook as its helmsman? Inside the company, the word is that nothing seems different; business goes on as usual, work gets done, the relentless pressure on the staff continues. One thing that has gone: Jobs's sometimes infuriating (to staff) ability to argue one position on one day, and the exact opposite the next. \"I saw it daily,\" Cook said.</p> <p>But without Jobs, can Apple still innovate? <a href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/george_colony/12-04-25-apple_sony\" title=\"\">George Colony of Forrester Research suggested in April</a> that Apple will, like Sony after the death of its leader, Akio Morita, in 1999, decline: \"When Steve Jobs departed, he took three things with him: 1) singular charismatic leadership that bound the company together and elicited extraordinary performance from its people; 2) the ability to take big risks; and 3) an unparalleled ability to envision and design products.\"</p> <p>He suggested that Apple had between two and four years before revenue growth and product innovation would stall.</p> <p>Cook, though, denied that Jobs had had such a key importance, especially in the product field. \"The [product] curator role moves around as it always had [when Jobs was there],\" Cook told the ATD conference. \"No one person does it all.\"</p> <p>Cook, like Jobs, still runs a tight ship in every sense: Apple is secretive about its plans and workings, with high-profile one-off presentations run by the top executives \u2013 Cook; the marketing chief, Phil Schiller; the iPhone software chief, Scott Forstall \u2013 over off-the-record meet-the-press brunches. For journalists and analysts, predicting Apple's next move is like being a Kremlinologist in the Soviet era: the slightest shift in public posture or hint of an approach to another company is minutely examined, and can stir rumours and make stock prices yo-yo.</p> <p>Cook himself remains largely an enigma \u2013 though famed in the industry for his ability to control the supply chains that are essential to any hardware maker's success. Single, and just weeks from his 52nd birthday, he is known as a fitness nut who goes hiking and cycling, and whose day often starts at 4.30am with a barrage of emails. His real skill, analysts agree, lies in the hidden iceberg of getting products built: the \"supply chain\" of manufacturers and parts makers who contribute everything that goes into the phones, tablets and computers it sells.</p> <p>Yet to external observers, quite a few subtle differences are evident in the year since Jobs's death. The first was <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/2/2766403/tim-cook-apple-charity-project-red-stanford\" title=\"\">Cook's decision in February to make donations to charity with Apple's money</a> \u2013 $50m to Stanford hospitals, and a further $50m to other causes since then. Jobs, it was commonly agreed, would never have done that; one book, Inside Apple, quotes him as saying that giving money away was \"a waste of time\". (And, presumably, money.)</p> <p>The same month came another surprise: <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/02/13Fair-Labor-Association-Begins-Inspections-of-Foxconn.html\" title=\"\">a statement about working conditions at the Foxconn plants in China</a> where iPhones and iPads are made and assembled, in which Cook said: \"We believe that workers everywhere have the right to a safe and fair work environment\" and instituted wide-ranging checks by the Fair Labor Organisation, after a growing chorus of criticism over worker suicides and reports of exploitation.</p> <p>Next was another move involving money: in March, Cook announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/19/apple-dividend-share-buyback\" title=\"\">Apple would begin paying a dividend on its shares</a>, for the first time since March 1995. That was when it first began to run into financial problems \u2013 from which it was only saved by Jobs's return in 1997, and then his hiring of Cook to take over the supply chain in 1998. Also in March this year, Cook did yet another thing Jobs never did: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/27/apple-tim-cook-visits-china\" title=\"\">a public visit to the Foxconn factories</a>, where he was photographed on the assembly lines \u2013 something that none of the senior executives at other companies who also use Foxconn, such as Dell, HP or Microsoft, has done.</p> <p>Charities, fair labour, dividends \u2013 all put a much more empathic face on a company that under Jobs had seemed hard and uncaring, particularly over Chinese workers' conditions.</p> <p>That suggests that Cook is trying to mould the company to see itself not as a scrappy underdog \u2013 as it was under Jobs until recently \u2013 but as what it actually is, a business giant, even though (as Cook once put it) all the individual products it sells could fit on a tabletop.</p> <p>\"I think the overarching theme for Cook v Jobs is that Cook is trying to show a softer side of Apple,\" says Horace Dediu, who runs the Asymco consultancy. \"He seems to be willing to put a gentle and less recalcitrant face on the company. All these things, even dividends, are signals that Apple is kinder, gentler. However, it's early days. Every new manager wants to place his mark on the company and distance himself from the predecessor. In many ways they [Apple] have not changed.\"</p> <p>Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS Screen Digest, says: \"If there is a change in Apple under Cook \u2013 and that's far from certain \u2013 it has been one of communication tone, and not product substance. Apple now appears slightly softer, more human, more socially aware in its communications and is more willing to respond to consumer feedback.\"</p> <p>The clearest example of that came just last month, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/28/apple-maps-tim-cook-apology\" title=\"\">Cook penned an abject apology</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/20/apple-maps-ios6-station-tower\" title=\"\">quality of the maps service on the new iPhone operating system</a>. With 100 million people using it within just a week, the criticisms about errors \u2013 in locations, naming, or omissions \u2013 were overwhelming. Cook said he was \"extremely sorry\" and suggested a number of rival mapping services \u2013 including Nokia's and Microsoft's \u2013 available to iPhone users instead.</p> <p>A number of commentators said that Jobs would never have written such an apology \u2013 and would never have allowed maps of that quality to be released as a fully fledged product. But Carolina Milanesi, smartphone and tablets analyst at the Gartner research group, disagrees: \"People think that Steve [Jobs] would have never brought maps to market. But there are indeed examples of products or services that came to market under Steve that were not perfect: 'antennagate' with the iPhone 4 [where call quality fell when the phone was held in the left hand] and Mobile Me [Apple's first attempt at a cloud service in July 2008, which saw people lose emails and synchronisations fail].\" She thinks that when it came to the maps apology, \"doing a mea culpa was less damaging than letting people think that Apple's core values have changed\".</p> <p>Ironically, given Cook's expertise at wringing the best out of Apple's suppliers, it's also the supply chain that most threatens the company's treasured secrecy about what it will do next. Ahead of the iPhone 5 launch, almost every detail about its physical appearance was known: the screen size, new charging interface, camera. That's because parts and photos had leaked out from various plants \u2013 and because iPhones are made by the million, and there's huge value to rivals and accessory makers in knowing what the next model will look like, such details have become precious knowledge indeed.</p> <p>The latest supply chain leaks \u2013 <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304141204577506471913819412.html\" title=\"\">reported by the Wall Street Journal</a>, which demands at least two separate sources for any \"anonymous\" story \u2013 suggest that Apple is building an \"iPad mini\", a smaller version of its iPad, to be unveiled later this month. It will be the first entirely new product Cook has overseen; analysts are already totting up how many millions it might sell in the months until Christmas, even before its existence is confirmed.</p> <p>It's been a long haul for Cook, who said he wanted to work with Jobs within five minutes of his job interview in 1998. But he still has some way to go. Milanesi, says: \"The status of demigod that Steve had meant he got away with more than your average CEO gets away with. Tim is not Steve. Which is not good or bad. Just different.\"</p>",
  "<p>The British civil rights lawyer Clive Stafford Smith and international cricketer turned politician Imran Khan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/imran-khan-taliban-march-drones\">will begin a peace march</a> on 7 October into Pakistan's Waziristan region. Their aim is to highlight the plight of innocent people killed or injured by US drones. </p> <p>Smith took the precautionary measure of writing to President Obama and his CIA director, David Petraeus, informing them about the march. In the letter, he requested that the president ensure the names of him and the other marchers would not be on the weekly kill list the president reviews, along with security officials, in the White House situation room. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reprieve.org.uk%2Fmedia%2Fdownloads%2F2012_09_27_PUB_CSS_to_Obama_drones_march.pdf&amp;ei=B7RsUJ_tLunL0QXwv4A4&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_WMValkrU4AB-6TDHgVX6h4554A\">Smith wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Please remember that you and I are both lawyers from the same tradition, and it would be unseemly (as well as being both illegal and upsetting for my family) if you were to authorize my assassination.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Like the sealed corridors in which the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all\">top secret kill list nomination process occurs</a> \u2013 an account of which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/us/national-security-leaks-lead-to-fbi-hunt-and-news-chill.html?pagewanted=all\">was reportedly leaked</a> by the Obama administration to the New York Times \u2013 Waziristan has, until now, remained in the shadows, a place about which very little is known or reported. It is hoped the march will help open the area to public scrutiny by taking media there to gather independent information. </p> <p>Smith's letter also highlighted problems with the president's drone strategy, such as using the same intelligence that populated Guant\u00e1namo Bay. I think it's fair to assume intelligence-gathering has improved \u2013 one certainly hopes so, considering 88% of Guant\u00e1namo's 779 detainees were <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theguardian.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:sVxZIQKm9asJ:www.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Factsheet_Closing_Guantanamo.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjq-3GNyo5imDa4tnrRnDzPvgsriGpSlqIDMHspZ1cHhUb2VBeXDWH27XNPdLq4l6grZgWIT6aFVKb0sIvastH4bi1O79thKfcvnHtqc-y3C6OUWnLB6AB9JWk2Ffst2x3tmM1N&amp;sig=AHIEtbRdOddG33Yb5XishcmW1MeVVelSFA\">cleared for release</a>. But of greater note is how Obama campaigned against President Bush by criticising his policy of imprisoning without trial \u2013 yet has chosen to kill individuals without trial. </p> <p>There's no evidence those in Waziristan deemed America's enemies have either the will or ability to threaten America from thousands of miles away, Smith wrote. The region's threat extends, at most, to Pakistan, which should be allowed to resolve its own problems \u2013 as those such as Imran Khan argue that it is capable of doing. But on this point, I sympathise with Obama, since the Pakistan government has mastered the art of emitting mixed signals and behaves as an unreliable ally. Eyebrows that were raised over Osama bin Laden <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-02/news/29521402_1_compound-pakistani-city-military-town\">being found</a> next to the Pakistan military academy in Abbottabad have yet to find reason to be lowered.</p> <p>US concern over a nuclear-armed Pakistan is also understandable, and Smith's letter acknowledged that further radicalization of Waziristan is a threat to Pakistan and global security. But the US's chosen course of action undermines its objective, resulting in damage to its reputation, a failure to win hearts and minds \u2013 evidenced by <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/06/27/chapter-1-views-of-the-u-s-and-american-foreign-policy-5/\">research showing 97% of Pakistanis</a> opposed to US action within their territory \u2013 and culminating in what Smith calls the \"desperate failure of US policy\". Wailing Iraqi mothers and maimed Afghan children whom I saw during operational tours with the British army vouch for that.</p> <p>I share Smith's indignation at the Obama administration's suggestion that the \"just war\" theories of <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303665904577452271794312802.html\">St Thomas Aquinas and St Augustine</a> temper its use of drones. Smith highlights how the secretive machinations of the CIA do not constitute a clear declaration of war by a sovereign nation. Neither is drone use justified as a last resort \u2013 another principle of \"just war\" theory. But in applying such principles either to support or criticise drones, we risk formulating a surreal and counterproductive argument, which indeed characterises much of the debate.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, Smith takes a dim view of how the administration \"counts all military-age males in a strike zone as combatants\", <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?pagewanted=all\">according to the New York Times report</a>, \"unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.\" Stanley Kubrick's film Dr Strangelove doesn't come close to matching that logic for war room farce.</p> <p>To ensure the marchers' safe passage into Waziristan, four groups were identified from whom assurances were needed. These included locals and tribal leaders, the Pakistan army, the Pakistan Taliban and finally the US. Currently, all but the US have provided their assurances. Smith said his greatest worry concerns a CIA-sponsored attack made to appear it was carried out by the Taliban.</p> <p>Perhaps the march might also go some way to unmasking the Taliban. In Afghanistan, I never saw them. They remained heat signatures on computer screens, or the unseen origins of shots and mortars. I spurn the reductionism of the usual narrative presenting them all as lunatics hell-bent on anarchy, a lie that has been contradicted by the publication of Taliban poetry. We disrespect our enemies at our peril, primarily by missing the crucial fact we might negotiate with fellow sentient beings.</p> <p>I believe President Obama is a sentient and intelligent man, and I give him credit for shouldering responsibility for the kill list's consequences and not delegating to others. But as I found when gazing at computer screens in Afghanistan, it's easy to succumb to tunnel vision and become captivated by drones' short-term solutions.</p> <p>Most importantly, the march will bring attention to the forgotten people, 800,000 of them, who call Waziristan home, and have lived in fear for eight years since the US intervention began. We too easily forget how simple homesteads that don't look like much are the centre of inhabitants' universes, all too easily eradicated by drones' missiles \u2013 be it in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen or elsewhere, as their use spreads.</p> <p>Smith ended his letter asking the president to confirm the CIA will not target the marchers, even as they apologise to those who have suffered. \"Surely, I don't ask much: simply not to be killed,\" he wrote.</p>",
  "<p>The government's disastrous handling of the competition for the west coast main line franchise (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/03/virgin-rail-west-coast\" title=\"\">Virgin back on track in rail shambles</a>, 4&#xa0;October) is the latest in a long line of coalition cock-ups \u2013 but it also highlights all that is wrong with the UK's privatised rail system.</p> <p>Since privatisation in the 1990s, the cost of train travel in the UK has risen by 17% in real terms \u2013 compared with a&#xa0;7% drop in the cost of motoring. Fares are now some of the highest in Europe and the government's plan for a further 6.2% increase from January 2013 is the last straw for many commuters in my constituency.</p> <p>Thanks to higher interest payments to keep debts off the government balance sheet, and costs arising from fragmentation and the complex network of subcontractors, the cost to the public purse of running the railways has risen by 2 to 3 times since privatisation. Now taxpayers are told we must cough up \u00a340m in compensation to the four west coast bidders.</p> <p>What rail passengers want most of all is stability and value for money \u2013 not one unaccountable company snatching control from another with promises they may never deliver. So, instead of tinkering round the edges of a system that is not fit for purpose, the Greens are calling for an end to private ownership. Bringing the railways back into public hands could save over \u00a31bn a year of taxpayers' money \u2013 some of which could be spent on reducing fares. Britain was once world famous for its trail blazing and hugely successful railways. But unless they are returned to public ownership, we will struggle on with a fragmented, complex and often dysfunctional system that rips off passengers, harms the economy and fails the environment.<br><strong>Caroline Lucas</strong><br><em>MP for Brighton Pavilion, Green party</em></p> <p>\u2022 The rail franchise fiasco can come as no surprise if it follows the sort of procurement practices current in the \"reformed\" NHS. In Newcastle recently, the control of Grainger Medical Group, managed by the North of Tyne primary care trust (PCT), was contracted to Care UK. The process was managed by a separate company, the North East procurement service. The bids were anonymous.</p> <p>This means the PCT only became aware that the successful bid for Grainger was Care UK after the contract had been awarded. There was an outcry in protest at the appointment of a private company and at a lack of consultation. Information from the PCT revealed that, since there was no means to research track record or company structure of a bidder for such a contract, the only relevant information was what the bidder chose to submit.</p> <p>This seems insane and farcical. How do they know that the bids are from competent sources? What guarantees are there that the practice&#xa0;will be managed with the welfare of patients at its core? How does this match the avowed intent of the PCT to make quality of&#xa0;patient&#xa0;care central? The rail franchise collapse only emphasises the need for a thorough examination of all such processes.<br><strong>Martin Manasse</strong> <br><em>Newcastle upon Tyne</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have no detailed knowledge of the west coast franchise case, but it highlights a&#xa0;basic flaw in the current practice of contracting out, instead of relying on in-house public service providers. In the latter case, the essential criterion is that the decision should be the best available in the public interest, defensible as a proper use of taxpayers' money. But contracting-out decisions have to be justified under different, legal criteria, including the requirement to ensure that the interests of all parties are fully considered and safeguarded.</p> <p>No doubt the two sets of criteria overlap, and may often coincide. But judges are not best placed to decide on the public interest, and apply different rules whose effect is sometimes uncertain and unpredictable.</p> <p>For example in the past, the Department of&#xa0;Transport has lost judicial review cases on the grounds that the secretary of state's discretion must not be \"fettered\" by administrative rules \u2013 which seems to imply that a minister must decide each individual case on&#xa0;its merits, without regard for consistency.&#xa0;The creeping extension of judicial review has made life more difficult for public servants and ministers \u2013 but contracting out makes it substantially worse. <br><strong>Alan Bailey</strong><br><em>Permanent secretary, Department of Transport 1986-91</em></p> <p>\u2022 The previous minister of transport, Justine Greening, described the tender process for the west coast franchise as \"robust\". It is only because Richard Branson threatened to bring a high-court action to contest the awarding of the contract to FirstGroup that it has transpired that the process, far from being robust, is seriously flawed. The current transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, says that the fault lies with the civil servants charged with assessing the tenders. Consideration of other rail tenders has now been \"paused\". Does this cast doubt on the whole process by which civil servants assess high-value service provider contracts? Many are subsequently found to be seriously deficient in their delivery, such as those awarded to Atos, G4S, A4e and ALS (Court Translation Service). Numerous NHS services are currently being put up for tender on the open market. Can we be sure that these will go through a truly \"robust\" process?&#xa0; There will be no Richard Branson on hand to challenge the outcome.<br><strong>John Mills</strong> <br><em>Matlock, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your editorial (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/rail-franchises-signal-failure-editorial\" title=\"\">A signal failure</a>, 4&#xa0;October) identifies the problem that caused the franchise to be let incorrectly as a process failure. This implies that all franchise applications were estimated according to the same process. But then we read that: \"First's revenue projections were based on a preposterous increase in journeys.\" It seems that the four shortlisted applicants were able to make their own projections of future events which affect journeys to be made in the future. If this is the case, why not recalculate all applications on each of the proposed future projections. The best application would then be the one which gave the greatest return on the worst projection.<br><strong>Owen Ephraim</strong><br><em>Chelmsford, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Government ministers \"find evidence-based analysis 'unhelpful'\"?

So it was a bristled, vampire parrot-like dinosaur.\"</p> <p>That, of course, is not its official name. The new species that Sereno has now described in an <a href=\"http://www.pensoft.net/news.php?n=166&amp;SESID=aae59fd0600a536c454c8abc8a5d804e\">analysis in the journal Zookeys</a> is called <em>Pegomastax africanus</em> \u2013 Latin for \"thick jaw from Africa\". It is one of a well-known breed of tiny early dinosaurs called heterodontasaurs, which refers to their unusually-shaped teeth.</p> <p>Which is where the vampire moniker comes from. For Sereno's new species of heterodontasaur has especially unusual and prominent front teeth, giving its skull a fearsome look that more than resembles something about to try and suck some blood. It also has a short, parrot-like beak. \"What was it doing with these fangs?\" asks Sereno.</p> <p>In his paper he answers his own question. Though some scientists have suggested that heterodontasaurs used their teeth to eat small prey \u2013 such as insects \u2013 that could supplement a plant-based diet, Sereno disagrees. Instead he suggests that the dinosaurs were entirely vegetarian and used their teeth for other reasons, such as display to attract a mate or to frighten off larger creatures that might prey upon them. He points to modern animals, such as the peccary and the fanged deer, which have similar dental arrangements despite being herbivores.</p> <p>In order to back up his thesis, Sereno examined the fossils of a specimen of <em>Pegomastax africanus</em>, and looked at wear and tear traces, as well as the way that its jaws and teeth articulated and fitted together. He concluded that the teeth were simply not suited to cutting meat and even built a wooden model to back up his ideas. \"The fangs were something for display. These were not scissors for slicing meat,\" he said.</p> <p>Sereno did not discover his specimen out in the field. But instead came across it in a collection of fossils at Harvard. He first noticed it in 1983 \u2013 after the collection had arrived at Harvard in the 1960s from South America \u2013 but it took him almost three decades to get around to trying to officially describe it. \"I got swept up in other expeditions after I first noticed it and so it took me 30 years to write it up,\" he said.</p> <p>The specimen was found in rock that was around 200 million years old and the species eventually died out after spreading all over the world. Sereno believes its diet and habitat became specialised and made it vulnerable to changes in its environment. \"I suspect the plant life they depended upon disappeared, and that is what caused their extinction,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>As I walked out of a noticeably dirty Hyatt hotel while on a book tour in San Francisco last week, I was startled by a major labor event with a well-executed picket line and loud, disciplined chanting. It became clear that the housekeeping staff and their union were asking customers to boycott Hyatt over a dispute of which I had been unaware.</p> <p>I received a tip to the story from Julia Wong of <a href=\"http://www.unitehere.org/\">Unite Here</a>, a coalition of union members in the hospitality industry, which asserts that Hyatt commonly exploits its workers. At first, housekeepers were calling for boycotts of individual Hyatt properties. But when Hyatt refused to address some of the concerns raised \u2013 such as health and safety, when the hotel chain led the opposition to a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/19/california-hotel-maids-bedsheets_n_850766.html\">California bill</a> that would have required hotels to use fitted sheets in order to ease the physical burden on cleaners \u2013 the effort ramped up to a global boycott. </p> <p>In July 2012, Unite Here and other groups, including the National Football Players' Association \u2013 whose representatives said that many players had been raised by hardworking women like the housekeepers who had joined the campaign \u2013 launched the escalated boycott, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/23/hyatt-hotels-boycott_n_1694828.html\">Hyatt Hurts</a>. The coalition already includes some serious players in the feminist and leftwing activist worlds like the National Organization of Women (NOW), Moveon.org and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hyatthurts.org/2012/07/global-boycott-of-hyatt-launched/\">Hyatt has been awarded the dubious title of</a> \"the Worst Hospitality Employer in America\" by the Hyatt Hurts website. Rather movingly, as the movement spread, workers in Hyatts in India, the UK, Israel and the Phillipines went on strike. This is a historic effort, because as globalization extends employers' power globally, it also strengthens the global counter-protest, or global boycott, by uniting workers across the world to organize successfully from the ground upwards.</p> <p>In interviews with the housekeepers, the issue of these women often being treated as if they are \"invisible\" came up again and again, as did the quantity of extremely hard work, sometimes injurious, that is expected of the mostly female, and mostly non-white, workers. As they pointed out, hotel guests rarely think about this, simply expecting vacuumed floors and dusted surfaces. But cleaning women and men typically perform heavy labor very quickly for a big chain such as Hyatt. In May, the federal authority, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), actually <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/Blog/Corporate-Greed/OSHA-Warns-Hyatt-on-Housekeeper-Injuries\">sent a letter to Hyatt management</a>, warning executives about the health risks of driving their cleaning people so ruthlessly (a letter that is considered a first in the industry).</p> <p>The Hyatt staff whom I interviewed describe the rapid pace of cleaning room after room, including the hard physical work like scrubbing bathrooms on one's hands and knees and lifting heavy mattresses. These and other strenuous moves increase the likelihood of back and knee injuries given the expected high room turnover.</p> <p>Jacob Tomsky, a desk clerk for a luxury hotel who has written a tell-all account of working in the hospitality industry, Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles and So-Called Hospitality, has great sympathy for housekeepers' work conditions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There is nothing easy about housekeeping. There is nothing easy about dealing with other people's filth and having to get on your knees to do it. There is nothing easy about scouring and spraying and polishing and getting on all fours to make sure there isn't a porno magazine under the bed skirt \u2026 There is nothing easy about being sexually harassed by guests. There is nothing easy about scrubbing a toilet on Christmas morning, believe me.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>When I contacted Hyatt about Unite Here's claims on health and safety, Doug Patrick, Hyatt's senior VP of human resources, responded:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Hyatt provides industry-leading wage and benefits packages, maintains an outstanding workplace safety record, and is a recognized leader in promoting a diverse workforce \u2026 It is because of our commitment to our associates that average tenure of our housekeepers at our North American properties is more than 12 years, with approximately half of our nearly 40,000 associates having worked with us for more than 10 years.</p> <p>\"Housekeeping can be a physical and difficult job. Contrary to Unite Here's assertions, our associates have the tools, resources and training they need to do great work.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Patrick also said that Hyatt's workplace safety record \"has been validated\" by the OSHA, and counter-claimed that OSHA investigations had been instigated by Unite Here \"as part of its ongoing campaign to pressure Hyatt to impose union membership on employees\".</p> <p>A second issue raised by Hyatt Hurts is that Hyatt has led the industry in union-busting and exploitative temp-work outsourcing. <a href=\"http://www.unitehere.org/presscenter/release.php?ID=4644\">A federal agency has issued</a> a complaint against two Hyatts in San Francisco for violating the law by implementing \"E-Verify\" \u2013 a practice that immigrant rights advocates say is riddled with errors and can be used by employers to intimidate immigrant workers.</p> <p>On the outsourcing charge, Hyatt's Doug Patrick stated:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"More than nine out of ten workers in US Hyatt hotels are Hyatt employees. On an as-needed basis, and like virtually all hotel management companies, Hyatt uses staffing companies to supplement certain functions at our hotels so we can respond effectively to fluctuations in business levels and can operate efficiently.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In San Francisco, I was appalled at the response a representative for Hyatt's management when I asked her to explain Hyatt's position on the striking workers.</p> <p>\"Those people don't even work here,\" she said through clenched lips. Which misses the point: of course, they don't work there \u2013 they are union brothers and sisters of those who do work there. That is what a union does, that is how it works: solidarity.</p> <p>What will be the outcome of the global boycott? Can these workers win?</p> <p>The odds are daunting: housekeeper staff are at the very bottom of the social hierarchy in the hospitality industry \u2013 the hidden hands that make travel comfortable and clean. They lack money, representation and clout. And as Hyatt continues to contract out temp work systematically, the chain is probably betting that even more desperate workers will quietly take their places.</p> <p>But what was obvious from talking to the workers outside the Hyatt Embarcadero \u2013 obvious in a <a href=\"http://www.calaborfed.org/index.php/site/author_archive/1131\\\">union-busting age</a> during a presidential election where one candidate is committed to gutting labor \u2013 is the conviction that it is \"the union makes [them] strong\". Thousands of \"invisible\" women and men uniting around the world may be able to do what one woman or man kneeling alone, scrubbing a bathroom floor can never accomplish.</p> <p>I, for one, was persuaded that I no longer wished to spend another night, or one more tourism dollar, in a Hyatt hotel until a group like Unite Here can give the chain a clean bill of health.</p>",
  "<p>When Brian Clive Forster QC was appointed as a circuit judge his son grew wearily accustomed to one particular joke. \"Hope you won't be spending as much time sitting on the bench as your dad,\" quipped many of those crossing Fraser Forster's path. Five years on from his father's elevation, the family have another cause for celebration.</p> <p>Forster's inclusion in the England squad comes after Roy Hodgson faced concerted lobbying to select the 6ft 7in goalkeeper from both the FA's outgoing head of elite development, Gareth Southgate, and Celtic's manager, Neil Lennon. Following two seasons on loan at Celtic from Newcastle United, Forster signed for Lennon's side in a \u00a32m transfer this summer. The fact that he never made a first-team appearance in six years at St James' Park conceals the high regard with which the 24-year-old was held on Tyneside.</p> <p>Had the outstanding Tim Krul been poached by a leading club during the close season, Forster would have been Alan Pardew's first-choice keeper at Newcastle. Instead he bid his slightly reluctant farewells and embarked on a Champions League adventure with Celtic that perhaps finally persuaded Hodgson to summon him south of Hadrian's Wall.</p> <p>Paul Lambert may wonder why England's coach took so long. Aston Villa's manager had Forster on loan at Carrow Road during the 2009-10 season during which Forster helped Norwich out of League One, keeping 18 clean sheets in 38 league appearances.</p> <p>Born in Hexham, Northumberland, he was privately educated at Newcastle's Royal Grammar School. A promising cricketer and rugby player Forster did not take up goalkeeping until the age of 13. \"As a family we're not really football oriented,\" his father has said. Initially coaches wondered if Forster junior might be too small for the position. \"I was never the tallest until later in my teens,\" Fraser has recalled. \"Then, at about 15 I started growing and didn't stop.\"</p> <p>By then he had joined the famous Wallsend Boys Club. Evenings at Wallsend offered a very different environment from the RGS but as Forster senior once reflected: \"Fraser is a very laid back character who takes most thing in his stride and won't take too much heed of what anyone might say.\"</p> <p>Newcastle United proved the next stop but the presence of Shay Given, Steve Harper and Krul made things rather crowded for a young man who had abandoned the idea of attending university in order to turn professional. There were days when Forster senior telephoned Glenn Roeder, Newcastle's former academy director, to question his son's progress. Patience was advised and unglamorous loan spells at Stockport and Bristol Rovers were augmented by numerous outings as a Newcastle substitute.</p> <p>It would prove a sometimes frustrating induction but Forster's amalgam of brilliant shot-stopping and intimidating size have placed him within touching distance of England's 2014 World Cup squad.</p>",
  "<p>There are perhaps more relaxing preparations for interviewing Neil Young about his autobiography than reading Neil Young's autobiography. It's not that <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241962176,00.html\" title=\"\">Waging Heavy Peace</a> isn't a good book. It is, albeit in a very Neil Young-ish way. Over the course of its 500 pages, Waging Heavy Peace is variously wildly idiosyncratic, unpredictable, bafflingly digressive, wryly funny, deeply moving, plain-speaking, still in thrall to the mysticism of the late 60s, painfully honest \u2013 \"do not doubt me in my sincerity,\" counsels Young at one point, \"for it is this which has brought us to each other now\" \u2013 infuriatingly elusive and shot through with moments of rare insight and beauty, which you might say makes it the perfect literary counterpart to the 50-year career it describes, in a fairly roundabout way.</p> <p>Anyone hoping for a chronological hop through Young's triumphs \u2013 the astonishing run of albums that stretches from 1969's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Knows_This_Is_Nowhere\" title=\"\">Everybody Knows This is Nowhere</a> to 1979's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Never_Sleeps\" title=\"\">Rust Never Sleeps</a>, the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, his early 90s resurgence, borne by the alt-rock scene&#xa0;his music inspired \u2013 is going to&#xa0;go home very disappointed indeed. The main criticism of it is that it has a tendency to ramble, but as fans at Crazy Horse's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/arts/music/global-citizen-festival-with-neil-young-to-combat-poverty.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">recent show in New York's Central Park</a> would have told you&#xa0;\u2013 perhaps as their version of 1991's Love and Only Love entered its 14th minute, with no sign of a conclusion in sight \u2013 Young is an artist who has&#xa0;always reserved the right to&#xa0;ramble on a bit.</p> <p>The problem, at least for the prospective interviewer, and particularly if&#xa0;the interviewer is a huge, hawkish Young fan, comes when you reach the part where Young reveals his feelings about interviews. \"I hate interviews,\" he offers, fairly unequivocally. Journalists, meanwhile, are \"jerks\" and \"dickheads\". He is specifically referring to the journalists from Associated Press present at the infamous mid-80s interview when Young \u2013 he of the peace signs on his guitar strap and <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/17059994\" title=\"\">the song</a> about how he never knew a man could tell so many lies until he saw Richard Nixon \u2013 <a href=\"http://thrasherswheat.org/ptma/reagan.htm\" title=\"\">appeared to voice support for Ronald Reagan</a>. But you somehow get the feeling it extends to the profession as a&#xa0;whole. Still, at least the prospective interviewer can console himself with the fact that he's not a blogger, by contrast with whom journalists appear to be his favourite people in the world.</p> <p>Still, crackling down the line from his New York publisher's office, the 66-year-old sounds affable enough. If I&#xa0;never exactly get the impression that talking to me is the highlight of his day, at least it's nothing compared with some of the stories that circulate among quaking hacks who have made his acquaintance over the years.</p> <p>It might help that I can't see him: Young's eyes apparently have a habit of&#xa0;fixing journalists with a glare that causes them to wake in a cold sweat years after their encounter. \"Back in the beginning I was averse to doing press because I'm not really comfortable with reading about myself,\" he offers. \"It pisses me off that I can't just create art and have the art stand on its own. I&#xa0;would say, hey, if it's a great album it's going to sell \u2026 If it sucks, you know, no one's going to buy it. If it's mediocre, some people will buy it, or it could be great and nobody will get it. But it doesn't make any difference what you say about it.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, he says, Waging Heavy Peace isn't intended as a rebuttal, a misunderstood artist setting the facts straight: he professes not to care about the shelfloads of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/jun/29/biography.shopping\" title=\"\">books that have already been written about him</a>. \"There's nothing much I can do about it and it doesn't matter to me. I find it of interest just to look at it and go, hey wow, that's something else. What am I going to do with it? I don't know what to do with it.\"</p> <p>In fact, the book seems to have very prosaic reasons for existing. \"Writing is&#xa0;very convenient, has a low expense and is a great way to pass the time,\" he tells the reader at one juncture, with admirable candour. \"I highly recommend it to any old rocker who is out of cash and doesn't know what to do next.\" Young needed the money, because he appears to spend it as fast as he earns it. Not, it should be noted, on rock star fripperies, but on vast, complex non-musical projects about which he talks at length in Waging Heavy Peace: his <a href=\"http://www.lincvolt.com/\" title=\"\">Lincvolt</a> electric car, his inventions for model railways, and his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/shortcuts/2012/oct/02/neil-youngs-pono-change-music\" title=\"\">proprietary music system Pono</a>, an&#xa0;iPod rival he says delivers perfect studio sound quality.</p> <p>He had the time because he broke his toe and was unable to play live: \"My manager had mentioned that Penguin was interested in me doing my&#xa0;memoirs, but I hadn't thought much about it. But then when I broke my toe I was just sitting there going, what am I gonna do now? I thought: why don't I just do that book?\"</p> <p>To compound matters further, the&#xa0;author of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR6iRx9bXJI\" title=\"\">Homegrown</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6aXlqPMEXk\" title=\"\">Roll Another Number for the Road</a> had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/20/neil-young-drugs-alcohol-memoir?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">given up smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol</a> on his doctor's advice: he&#xa0;suffered a brain aneurysm in 2005, <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/obituary/ttoz/article/108045--scott-young-87-newspaper-columnist-author-wrote-in-the-morning\" title=\"\">the&#xa0;same year his father died</a> after a long struggle with Alzheimer's. He says that he had barely written a song in 40 years without smoking weed: according to the book, he had literally never performed with his most celebrated backing band Crazy Horse straight. Waging Heavy Peace is underpinned by&#xa0;a struggle to connect with his muse without the aid of a smoke. Given that he is about to release his second new album this year, it's a struggle he clearly overcame. Arriving hot on the heels of Americana, which featured Young and Crazy Horse singing the British national anthem, Psychedelic Pill opens with a track that clocks in at nearly 28 minutes: clearly Young's cranky eccentricity has survived sobriety intact. In Waging Heavy Peace, however, there are moments when Young openly wonders if he'll ever complete another song. \"How fucking loose do I have to be to write a&#xa0;song?\" he protests at one point.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y-nPsrX05Rk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y-nPsrX05Rk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"I was never really worried about it, other than I was curious about it, in a day-to-day way,\" he says<strong> </strong>to me. \"I'd go, wow, I've not written a song in&#xa0;a long time. This is very different. \" As it turns out, he didn't need marijuana to write songs at all. \"I didn't know at the time what was going to happen so I was discovering it, and now I've discovered that it doesn't matter.\"</p> <p>The book frequently turns up a fascinating nugget of information about a well-worn story from Young's career. He is wryly amusing about his mid-80s battles with his record label, which ended up suing him for making music \"that was uncharacteristic of Neil Young\": \"I don't,\" he says today, with charming understatement, \"react well to being told what to do.\" If it doesn't tell a fan much they don't already know about the demise of Crazy Horse's guitarist Danny Whitten, whose death from an&#xa0;overdose at 29 spurred Young to convene the drunken, grief-stricken recording sessions for 1975's astonishing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/album/e0207e33-af06-3862-baba-f42ca722de0d\" title=\"\">Tonight's the Night</a>, it does reveal that Joni Mitchell showed up during said sessions, proceeded to get as plastered on tequila as everyone else, then delivered what Young thinks is the greatest performance of her career: much to his chagrin, she refused to release it.</p> <p>The book also acts as an index of Young's obsessions, some of which, it has to be said, are more expected than others. He writes beautifully and very&#xa0;movingly about his wife and kids, not least his son Ben, born quadriplegic and with severe cerebral palsy, who Young calls his \"spiritual guide\". \"You can feel him,\" he says. \"He doesn't talk, so it's very spiritual, very brain-to-brain, soul-to-soul, and it's very refreshing and rejuvenating.\"</p> <p>Equally, he spends an unexpected amount of time discussing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Highway\" title=\"\">Human Highway</a>, the 1982 film comedy that he&#xa0;directed and starred in alongside Dennis Hopper: it cost Young $3m to make, and even his devoted fans tend to find it a bit of a schlep. He returns again and again to the truncated career of his and Stephen Stills's mid-60s band&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/22dc19af-d085-4c9b-adfb-22ec256251f1\" title=\"\">Buffalo Springfield</a>, which he seems to regard as unfinished business. \"It just seemed like it never reached its potential. There was always something wrong, always somebody missing, always some kind of conflict, always a&#xa0;problem. It stopped us from being as&#xa0;great as we could be, and we didn't know how to deal with it and so we really didn't quite succeed.\"</p> <p>Some people would say the same thing about Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, the early 70s supergroup torn apart in their prime by drug problems and ego, but Young insists Buffalo Springfield were different. \"The Buffalo Springfield \u2026 we lost our players, we didn't lose our minds. We lost our bass player\" \u2013 the late Bruce Palmer, who got deported back to Canada in fairly spectacular style after driving down the Pacific Coast Highway on LSD without a licence. \"We lost what made us great, and when we got the chance to record with the band in the first place we didn't have anyone good to take us into the studio and make the best of what we were. Two of the guys are no longer with us, so it's difficult, but we're yet to do something that \u2026\" His voice tails off. \"You never know.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YdVMGKOFIwY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YdVMGKOFIwY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In fact, Young writes with great affection for the late-60s hippy era, something that might come as a surprise to long-term fans. It was Young, after all, who spent his 1972 tour literally screaming at his docile hippy audience to wake up and realise that the utopian dreams of the Woodstock nation were dead, and that they had been bullshit all along. \"You can live your own life/ laid back and laughing?\" he howled on 1973's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftfNzAeO4eY\" title=\"\">Last Dance</a>, before singing the word \"no\" 60 times. A year later, he released the gripping <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZilu4ApCI0\" title=\"\">Revolution Blues</a>, which brought up the spectre of murderous hippy<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/charles-manson\" title=\"\"> Charles Manson</a>, whom no one other than Young really wanted to discuss: Crosby, Stills and Nash asked him not to perform it onstage. And yet, here he is, reflecting fondly on the clothes and drugs: he even seems quite affectionate about catching the clap. \"Well, those songs were reactions,\" he says. \"It's just disillusionment with the original idealism and naivety.\" Has time softened that disillusionment? \"Well, perspective changes it. Not softened.\" He laughs. \"It's just less in my face.\"</p> <p>Perhaps his affection had its roots in&#xa0;the enjoyment he clearly got from writing the book: reading it, his enthusiasm for the project is almost tangible. \"Well, it's always good to be doing something for the first time. There's no pressure,\" he says with an unmistakable wistfulness: in the book he keeps returning to how carefree he was in the&#xa0;early days of his solo career or Crazy Horse, before he was competing against his own past, before he had a vast, hugely influential back catalogue for his new music to be compared with. \"Well, there's the pressure to do something people feel is worthwhile, but other than that there is no pressure.\"</p> <p>Indeed, he enjoyed it so much, he is already writing another book, this time about cars. \"I do it really easily. I could probably do this and just this for the rest of my life, and I would be OK.\" But no, he says, there's no danger of that actually happening: much as the reader might get the impression he is currently more interested in electric cars or music players than music itself, he insists they're not taking over his life either. \"It gives me relief, it gives me something else to do so that music doesn't wear me out, so that I don't wear the music out. Everything should be taken in its own dose. You don't want to OD on music and then the music loses its potency. If that's all I&#xa0;did, it wouldn't be as good. I think if&#xa0;you don't have some obsession in your life, you're dead.\"</p>",
  "<p>A \"green\" energy installer who won \u00a3120,000 backing from two panellists on the Dragons' Den TV programme last year has seen his firm put into administration and his 15 staff made redundant. </p> <p>Chris Hopkins, also a member of the government's Green Construction Board, partly blames cuts in the feed-in tariff (FiT) subsidy regime for wrecking his business, Ploughcroft Business Services.</p> <p>\"A second reduction in the feed-in tariff in August finally killed it. It was probably 50/50, between that and my decision to put all my eggs into one solar basket,\" said the 42-year-old entrepreneur from Brighouse, Yorkshire.</p> <p>Hopkins also believes that winning the backing from Dragons' Den also may not have helped because it meant his high profile led to an explosion in the volume of his business. The TV programme's Theo Paphitis and Deborah Meaden put in \u00a360,000 each but Hopkins bought back their shares in May 2012.</p> <p>\"We were used to turning over more around \u00a32m a year and suddenly it went up to \u00a310m. I had to take on all kinds of new staff and computers to handle this and then business suddenly dropped off when the solar subsidy was cut [for the first time] on March 3,\" he said.</p> <p>Hopkins was talking from a rooftop on a mobile phone, which has become his new work environment. He has reconstituted the commercial operation as Ploughcroft Ltd and is working up a ladder with a couple of others fixing houses.</p> <p>It is something of a change for a man who also received the Institute of Directors' Yorkshire and Humber Award for entrepreneur of the year the and helped establish a series of innovative training schemes for solar installations.</p> <p>Hopkins said before the government started to promote the use of solar power, he had been struggling as an ordinary roofer feeling the impact of recession and a construction industry slowdown.</p> <p>The decision announced 12 months ago by the government to reduce the FiT by March 2012 led to a surge in orders followed by the sudden fall-off over the summer.</p> <p>Jeremy Leggett, founder of the much larger Solarcentury panel supply business, said the government bore a huge responsibility for destroying large parts of the photovoltaic sector. \"We are doing OK but its is quite clear that good businesses are going under because they have been ambushed by sudden and deep tariff cuts. I have no doubt that incumbent [fossil fuel] companies have successfully lobbied to derail the third [low carbon] industrial revolution.\"</p> <p>Governments across Europe have cut subsidies to solar power on the grounds that equipment prices have plummeted as Chinese and other low cost Asian producers have moved into western markets.</p> <p>But the debt crisis has also meant that ministers in many countries have been looking at cutting subsidies to save cash.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2012.

The fellow on stage said he didn't know anything about that.\"</p> <p>The confident, fired-up appearance by Obama was in stark contrast to his performance in the debate when he seemed disengaged, and at time frustrated as Romney batted away attacks on his policies.</p> <p>In one key exchange at the start, Obama said Romney was planning $5tn of tax cuts and had not explained how he was going to pay for those without increasing the deficit. Romney flat-out denied this was his policy.</p> <p>But independent analysts have said the tax cuts he is proposing would total almost $5tn over 10 years, and that it would be \"mathematically impossible\" to pay for that solely by stopping tax breaks for high-income individuals.</p> <p>Later, during a section on healthcare, Romney insisted that he had an alternative plan to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions were not discriminated against by health insurance companies. But after the debate, senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom conceded that it would be down to individual states to introduce legislation to protect people with pre-existing conditions.</p> <p>The Democrats are planning to hold Romney to account on these and other issues, Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, told reporters in a conference call on Thursday morning.</p> <p>\"Governor Romney gave a good performance and we give him credit for that,\" Axelrod said. \"The problem is that none of it was rooted in fact.\" Describing Romney as \"devoid of honesty\", he also accused the Republican of lying over his claim that he would regulate Wall Street.</p> <p>As the Obama team conducted its post-mortem, his campaign advisers faced questions about why Obama had appeared tired and uninterested, and about his failure to match Romney's aggression.</p> <p>Axelrod admitted that Democratic supporters would have been disappointed that Obama had not raised strong issues such as the Republican position on women's rights, or the secret video showing Romney disparaging 47% of voters as freeloaders or his record as chief executive of the investment fund Bain Capital. Axelrod said the president had not wanted the debate to turn into a slugfest that would have alienated the millions of television viewers.</p> <p>One of Axelrod's counterparts in the Romney camp, Ed Gillespie, interviewed on MSNBC, defended Romney's failure to go into the specifics of his tax plans, saying it would not make sense to box himself into a policy ahead of negotiations between a president and Congress.</p> <p>\"If you negotiate this now, you and me on the set or candidates in campaigns across the country, you end up locking people in positions in a political environment that makes it impossible to govern,\" Gillespie said.</p> <p>In the 90-minute debate, Romney was forceful from the start, accusing Obama of repeatedly portraying the Republican's policies as inaccurate, and he maintained that momentum throughout. Obama, looking tired and at times irritated, remained largely calm.</p> <p>Obama, seemingly frustrated with Romney's elusiveness, retorted that it had been his opponent's strategy for 18 months. \"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is: 'Never mind'\".</p> <p>At times, Romney patronised the president, saying that he did not understand business or accountancy. \"Mr President, you're entitled to your own airplane and your own house, but not your own facts,\" he said at one point. In another powerful attack which is at the core of the Romney message, he listed unkept promises and told Obama: \"You've been president for four years.\"</p> <p>The president, by contrast, was hesitant in his responses. One of the biggest surprises was that he failed to deliver any of the attacks that have been successful on the campaign trail and have been used to devastating effect in television ads in swing states. There was no mention of Romney's disparaging remarks about the 47% of the population being freeloaders, nor of his opponent's tenure at Bain Capital.</p> <p>The main image of the night will be of Romney, eyes alight, gesticulating from the podium with a rarely seen passion, while Obama, playing into his image as professorial, delivered most of his answers with his head down.</p> <p>On healthcare reform, Obama defended his controversial changes to expand coverage, saying it was almost identical to changes introduced by Romney while he was governor of Massachusetts.</p> <p>Romney denied they were identical, claimed Obama's plan increased costs and reiterated that he would repeal the reform.</p> <p>\"In my opinion, the government is not effective in bringing down the cost of almost anything. The right answer is not to have the federal government take over healthcare,'' Romney said.</p>",
  "<p>It is perhaps an unlikely theme for a blockbuster film in a country with a dire air safety record: a near miss in which a pilot steers a smoke-filled plane to safety.</p> <p>In Nigeria, Last Flight to Abuja has become the first homegrown production to outsell Hollywood films this year. Crowds have been packing cinemas to see how the Nollywood fiction matches the reality of taking an internal flight in Africa's most populous country.</p> <p>The film took a record-breaking 8m naira (\u00a332,340) in its first week on release in Lagos. It has toppled this year's box office hits The Amazing Spider-Man and Ice Age: Continental Drift, and is currently the second highest grossing film in west Africa after The Dark Knight Rises.</p> <p>\"Each time I fly in Nigeria it's a nervy experience. All the shaking, the bumpy landings, the unexplained noises, as the plane starts off five hours after you're supposed to have arrived at your destination,\" said the director, Obi Emelonye. \"The film was an accumulation of all those stories.\"</p> <p>The timing of the film's release was inauspicious. It coincided with a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/03/nigeria-plane-crash?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Dana Air plane smashing into a Lagos slum</a>, killing 163 people.

I felt I had a social responsibility to show [improvements] we could make with just a little change of attitude, being proactive,\" he said.</p> <p>Audiences have given the fictional white-knuckle ride a positive reception.</p> <p>\"When I watched it, I thought that's how a country with big dreams like Nigeria should be able to handle an aviation disaster,\" said cinemagoer Daye Sola, who has spurned domestic carriers since a \"bad experience\" 12 years ago.</p> <p>Not everybody is convinced by the fairytale ending, in which emergency workers are at the scene before the plane's dramatic touchdown.</p> <p>Femi Alade, whose house is within sight of where the Dana plane crashed, is a rare person from the slum who watched the film. \"Someone like me, I have never entered a plane and I will not do so. I enjoyed the film but afterwards I remembered how people were looting and police were beating the crowds,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The emergency reaction wasn't realistic, it was just too prompt,\" said another filmgoer, Ohimide, 32, after a showing in Lagos. The reality is undoubtedly grimmer. June's accident marked the start of a tumultuous period in which half of Nigeria's domestic airlines have been grounded.</p> <p>Africa accounts for 14% of the world's aeroplane crashes although it has only 3% of global traffic.</p> <p>Whistleblowers have claimed that heavy debts in the aviation sector routinely compromise safety.</p> <p>In some cases, insiders say planes have been dangerously overloaded with fuel to avoid paying refuelling fees in each country.</p> <p>David Kolawole's seven-month-old daughter survived the initial Dana Air impact. But emergency services took 45 minutes to push through the crowds thronging the slum's narrow mud roads. At the local hospital, staff were unable to save her amid electricity blackouts. \"In a country where people are prepared, she could have been saved,\" Kolawole said.</p> <p>An inquest revealed other failings, including emergency staff who had not been trained to put out an aircraft fire with chemical foam rather than water. The aviation minister, Stella Oduah, has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/09/nigerian-plane-crash-airline-licence?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">cleared Dana Air to fly again</a>, although an inquiry continues.</p> <p>Safety in Nigeria improved after two aircraft crashed within two months in 2005. But public distrust has returned since the country's most popular airline, Arik Air, was briefly grounded when aviation workers raided its offices, saying they had not been paid.</p> <p>Hailed for its fleet of new planes in a creaking industry, Arik had mopped up passengers in west Africa's thriving market as competitors floundered.</p> <p>Accusations of financial mismanagement have threatened to engulf the sector, which has grown steadily as air travel has become an alternative to being transported along the region's often poorly maintained roads.</p> <p>\"We had situations where some of our aircraft were flying with only one engine working rather than pay for the cost of maintaining two,\" said John Nnorom, a former finance director at Air Nigeria, one of the recently suspended airlines.</p>",
  "<p>An influential group of international banks and insurers has attacked political leaders in Europe over their handling of the Greek crisis, arguing that the singleminded pursuit of austerity has made the situation worse.</p> <p>The Institute of International Finance, which last year brokered a deal between Greece and international bond investors to halve Greece's private debts, said politicians were playing a dangerous game by putting their desire for debt reduction ahead of co-ordinated efforts to spur growth.</p> <p>Charles Dallara, the institute's chairman, said the world's major economies needed to co-ordinate their efforts or risk persistent instability and low growth.</p> <p>He said: \"The international financial community has a collective interest in reducing the uncertainty that currently surrounds the global economic outlook. If we want to lay the basis for a durable global economic expansion, then we need to see more concerted action by the world's policymakers.\"</p> <p>European policymakers are expected to come under fire at the IMF for their failure to bring an end to the crisis, which has triggered riots in Portugal, Spain and Greece. Spain is poised to apply for a bailout from the EU and IMF that could amount to \u20ac400bn (\u00a3320bn). Cyprus is expected to ask for an \u00a411bn bailout within days.</p> <p>The uncertainty surrounding the finances of major European nations has added to the instability, Dallara said.</p> <p>Central banks have flooded the world's financial systems with cheap funds to foster lending to businesses and households while banks rebuild their finances, but a disjointed and often contradictory response to financial regulation meant much of the money was not reaching its destination.</p> <p>\"The world economy appears to be stuck at the crossroads, being pushed in one direction by easier monetary policy, and pulled in another by fiscal austerity,\" he said. The situation in Greece, where unemployment and poverty have rocketed, was of particular concern, he said.</p> <p>The institute said the interest rate demanded by Brussels as the price of the Greek rescue package should be cut to allow the country to recover. \"It is urgent to complete the ongoing review of Greece's programme, with an extension of the time schedule of budget deficit targets,\" said Dallara. \"The latter can and could be accommodated without additional new financing by lowering interest charges on official credits in line with markedly reduced funding costs.\"</p> <p>Portugal's political consensus is also crumbling under the weight of austerity measures that have pushed the economy into a long depression. Portuguese unions have called for a general strike on 14 November after the government announced new tax rises and spending cuts, having withdrawn the previous batch following violent protests.</p> <p>The European Central Bank said a rescue package for Spain would not include \"punitive\" costs, as it kept base rates at 0.75%. The ECB president, Mario Draghi, hinted that he preferred to keep some of his armoury in reserve in case the economic situation in the 17-member eurozone deteriorated further.</p> <p>As Spain's prime minister Mariano Rajoy weighed up when to seek a bailout, his central bank chief yesterday undermined the government's proposed 2013 budget, saying it was based on over-rosy forecasts for growth and tax revenue.</p> <p>Speaking to a parliamentary budget committee, newly-appointed central bank governor Luis Maria Linde said: \"This outlook ... is certainly optimistic in comparison with the outlook shared by the majority of international organisations and analysts.\"</p> <p>Linde said the government, which has already raised taxes and cut tens of billions of euros in costs, should consider further steps this year to meet next year's deficit target of 4.5% of GDP agreed with the European Union.</p> <p>Linde said most independent forecasters expect a 1.5% contraction in Spain next year, rather than the 0.5% fall on which the government based its calculations.</p> <p>Fitch ratings agency also flagged the budget as unrealistic but said it would not downgrade Spanish bonds to junk status if the country sought a bailout and unlocked ECB bond-buying.</p> <p>Draghi said he stood ready to launch the ECB's latest sovereign bond buying scheme, which offers individual countries the opportunity to sell their bonds at low interest rates to remain solvent, but he had yet to receive any applications.</p> <p>But as if to exemplify the splits inside the eurozone, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, insisted that austerity measures be in place before the release of bailout funds. Sch\u00e4uble, who has a reputation as a fiscal hardliner, has previously blocked attempts to ease controls and cut interest rates for countries struggling with their debts.</p> <p>Dallara said a small group of key G20 nations, including the US and Japan should co-ordinate their efforts to tackle fundamental problems to spur growth.</p> <p>\"We call on the global policymaking leadership to act cohesively and give a clear direction. The international private financial community stands ready to do its part and cooperate, with its usual responsibility, with the official sector,\" he said.</p>",

  "<p>The circling and landing of carrion birds on waste tips is common enough.

This was spectacular over-leverage. The owners say they have invested heavily in the company, particularly in recycling, and that the \"quick buck\" was not the reason for the current state of play. Rather, the financial crisis intervened and the company can no longer service this crippling debt.</p> <p>In August, a consortium of Chinook Urban Mining, a London recycling specialist, the private equity investor Clearbrook Capital and the American bank JP Morgan bid just \u00a3520m for the group. But so far no decisions have been made either to sell, or how exactly to re-structure the debt so that the company is less burdened.</p> <p>In the words of Justin Bowden, national officer of the GMB union, the talks now going on \"are about buying and selling the debt, with the company being thrown in for free\".</p> <p>This situation is an object lesson in faulty economics, lack of democratic power, political blindness and a complete lack of solutions to an increasingly common problem \u2013 the hijacking of the real economy by financial pirates, often based offshore.</p> <p>The economics: Biffa is a good company, providing a service you can see and benefit from. It should have been protected to go on doing that. That means regulation, keeping its buyers onshore and having a legal requirement of transparency.</p> <p>Lack of democratic power: The fate of Biffa, an outsourcing company, is an awful warning amid the great outsourcing bonanza about to occur under the coalition's \"austerity\" programme. Contracts worth \u00a380bn from national and local government are coming down the slipway. Where are the political talks about how to stop any venture capitalist from plucking a good outsourcing company \u2013 Biffa \u2013 with a contract to deliver X and turning it into a debt-laden company only offering Y to an impoverished local authority with no expensive legal expertise to challenge the new owners?</p> <p>Political blindness: David Cameron knows that bins matter. He's a south Oxfordshire MP. What's stopping his government from coming up with a policy on protecting companies like Biffa from predatory purchasing?</p> <p>And the lack of solutions? South Oxfordshire is looking keenly at the upcoming Defra awards for good recycling. It's hoping Biffa will come up top. It's municipal pride in a job well done. What does that count for in the bankers' talks? The GMB has solutions that involve regulation, transparency and statutory requirements about where your takeover company is based. That must be right \u2013 but won't go down well with a government that uses the word regulation as an expletive.</p> <p>The Biffa case study shouldn't be wasted. It is an object lesson in how we have let the market run our real economy \u2013 rather than, as it should be, the other way round.</p>",
  "<p>On a drizzly, north London street last week, two police officers and three investigators from the medicines regulatory agency began ringing doorbells on a large red-brick Victorian house.</p> <p>This was a drugs bust \u2013 albeit a good-mannered one. The <a href=\"http://youtu.be/9ThzPDmlYgk\" title=\"Danny Lee-Frost talks about the raid (video)\">investigators were not after crack cocaine but illicit supplies of Modafinil</a>, a pill taken by students to help them stay up all night writing their essays.</p> <p>The team from the <a href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/#page=DynamicListMedicines\" title=\"\">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</a> (MHRA), accompanied by the Guardian, was mounting the raid as part of a global effort called Operation Pangea, involving 101 different countries.</p> <p>Pangea has seized \u00a36.5m of drugs globally, and more than 18,000 websites have been closed down or had payment facilties removed, while the MHRA has netted more than 2.3m doses of unlicensed medicine worth more than \u00a33.8m, including 68,000 counterfeit pills. The sequence of British raids was each named after a British prime minister, from Eden through to Blair \u2013 with the north-west London raid given the moniker Operation Home.</p> <p>This is the fifth year of a co-ordinated action against websites selling illegal and sometimes fake medicines. Most of the haul is Viagra and assorted versions of it; a raid the day before had turned up 13,000 packets, labelled as a Chinese herbal remedy.</p> <p>The investigators, led by Danny Lee-Frost, head of operations at the MHRA, had evidence, they said, that the less well-known Modafinil was being sold in the UK through a website registered to a man living at the London address. Although the website was registered in Hong Kong and claimed to be perfectly legal because it was outside British jurisdiction, a packet of pills bought as a test purchase by Lee-Frost's team was postmarked from north-west London. In the UK, Modafinil \u2013 also known as Provigil, Modalert and by other names too \u2013 can only be sold by a licensed pharmacist, to somebody with a doctor's prescription treating narcolepsy(a medical disorder involving the inability to stay awake) .</p> <p>\"The [operation] is to get the message out [to the public] that the internet is not a safe place to buy medicines,\" said Lee-Frost, whose idea Pangea was. Modafinil, he said, \"is a pretty powerful drug. It should only be prescribed by a doctor. It is not to be lightly used.\" The people running the websites \"are not interested in health. They are only interested in making money.\"</p> <p>The MHRA collaborates with a number of organisations to target illegal websites, from the Metropolitan police e-crimes unit to US homeland security and specialised organisations that identify suspect online activity.</p> <p>This raid was not at the crack of dawn, but at a less hostile 7.30am and there was no question of breaking down the door, although the MHRA officers are permitted to do that if it is proportionate to the offence. The two police officers, said Lee-Frost, were there \"to prevent any breach of the peace\" and \"to deal with the question of who we are\".</p> <p>Strict rules around the MHRA's powers of investigation mean there had been limited surveillance of the target. \"We're allowed one drive-by at the time we intend to go in, to see if the lights are on and there are kids' toys on the lawn \u2013 that sort of thing,\" said Lee-Frost.</p> <p>The house has been converted to more than a dozen flats, with no certainty any of the lit windows belonged to the target \u2013 just a lot of curtain-twitching from houses opposite. With no response to ringing the suspect's doorbell, the team tried all the rest in turn, until a young man in pyjamas was persuaded to come and open the front door. \"Golly,\" he said.</p> <p>Not long after the officers made their way up the stairs, Lee-Frost, on the pavement outside, got a call on his mobile. He looked glum.</p> <p>\"It's a one-room bedsit,\" he said. \"He claims he has closed down the website and it all comes from China. He rents a mailbox in the City and says that's where his laptop is.\"</p> <p>There were no pills and just a small amount of paperwork. They would try to persuade the suspect to hand over his laptop, but this raid was unlikely to lead to a spectacular court case, although they do happen. In April, the MHRA got a confiscation order in Southwark crown court for \u00a314.4m against a fake medicines dealer after tracking down his assets across Europe, which a judge decided were all the proceeds of crime.</p> <p>ModafinilUK, the website registered to the man in north-west London, was closed down on the day of the raid, just one of nearly 9,000 illegal pharmacy websites shut down. Like twigs on the branches of a tree, their URL addresses lead to a few \"anchor sites\" run, said the MHRA's head of enforcement, Nimo Ahmed, by organised crime networks, often based in Russia.</p> <p>The two biggest are well known \u2013 Eva Pharmacy, which makes around \u00a31.4m a month and GlavMed, making \u00a3620,000. Investigators spent several years targeting these organisations but, said Ahmed, it proved impossible to pin down evidence as to where and when crimes had taken place, with websites in Russia, medicines supplied from India and offshore bank accounts in which to store the proceeds.</p> <p>The Russian medicines authority went in and managed to rattle GlavMed, however. \"The individual who was supposed to be behind the website left the country a couple of weeks before the raids took place,\" said Ahmed.</p> <p>Unable to stamp out the anchor sites, the MHRA is still managing to choke off a lot of their trade, closing down linked sites, confiscating and testing suspect packages entering the country and working with Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and other payment organisations to stop the money getting through to the dealers.</p> <h2>Modafinil facts <br></h2> <p>Modafinil, sold on the internet under trade names including Provigil, is a drug developed to treat narcolepsy. Off-label use has been shown to reduce impulsiveness and help people focus.</p> <p>The drug has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/07/dementia-drugs-use-military\" title=\"\">used by the military</a> to keep soldiers awake and alert and by <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7173/full/4501157a.html\" title=\"\">scientists who want to focus</a> on a particular problem in their research. It could also be useful in helping shift workers deal with erratic working hours.</p> <p>In 2005, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/14/drugsandalcohol.health\" title=\"\">experts convened for a study on cognitive-enhancing drugs by the UK government's science thinktank, Foresight</a>,. They suggested Modafinil could improve a person's planning abilities when undertaking complex, chess-like problems.</p> <p>The Foresight group also said Modafinil might be used as a surrogate in treatment for addiction to illegal drugs such as cocaine. Modafinil can produce some of the effects of cocaine without the chronic dependence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.drugscope.org.uk/resources/drugsearch/drugsearchpages/Modafinil\" title=\"\">According to the charity Drugscope</a>, Modafinil's effects have been compared to stimulants such as Ritalin (which is used to treat attention deficit disorders in children), though Modafinil itself is not an amphetamine-related drug. <a href=\"http://www.tevausa.com/assets/base/products/pi/Modafinil_PI.pdf\" title=\"\">Side effects </a> can include skin rashes, hives, fever and swelling of the face, eyes lips or tongue. <strong>Alok Jha</strong></p>",
  "<p>The average American generates two kilogrammes of rubbish every day. That might not seem much. Until you total it up together that is. And then consider that more than half of this goes straight to landfill. Suddenly you have yourself a problem.</p> <p>How to reduce this 136 million tonne annual garbage dilemma? Get people recycling. Easy enough, you might think. Not so. Americans recycle, just not enough. Recycling rates in the US have inched up by around <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/images/index_msw_recycling_rates_900px.jpg\" title=\"\">one percent per year over the last two decades</a>. In landfill terms, that hardly makes a dent.</p> <p>It all comes down to scale. Yes, it's great that you carefully sort out your recyclables and leave them on the street for the recycling lorry. Yet the resource crisis looming over the planet requires everyone on your street to do the same. And not just on your street. On every street in your town, your nation and, dare we hope, the world.</p> <p>To date, large-scale behavioural change programmes have been the domain of governments. US recycling rates, for example, have crept up, largely thanks to curbside collection programmes laid on by local authorities. The story on public health is much the same. Attitudes to issues such as binge drinking, unprotected sex and regular exercise have largely shifted thanks to government-funded campaigns.</p> <p>Now companies are entering the fray. US consumer goods firm SC Johnson, for instance, has recently set up a <a href=\"http://www.scjohnson.com/en/press-room/press-releases/06-20-2012/SC-JOHNSON-COMBINES-LEARNING-AND-ACTION-TO-INSPIRE-GREEN-CHOICES.aspx\" title=\"\">Sustainable Behaviour Change Programme</a>. The hope is that by working out what motivates behaviour change, the company can - among other things - become \"waste neutral\" by 2016. To help it in that endeavour, it's corralled two of the best brains in the business: behaviour-change whizzes Professor Robert Cialdini and Professor Vladas Griskevicius.</p> <h2>Communicating change</h2> <p>Motivation is a good place to start. Establishing why people adopt \u2013 or don't adopt \u2013 a sustainable habit is a clearly critical if you want to move such habits into the mainstream. John Drummond, chairman of specialist consultancy Corporate Culture, gives the example of Anglian Water. The UK utility wanted to stop fast-food restaurants putting fats and oils down the sink, so it asked why blocked drains presented a problem. Restaurant owners cited the smell, which put off customers and saw income subsequently fall.</p> <p>\"You would have thought it was obvious\", Drummond says. \"But almost every other intervention up till then had been 'do it because there's legal requirement to do it.\" Anglian Water changed its messaging accordingly. Within six weeks, sewer blockages had halved.</p> <p>Action points. That's the second imperative to widespread behaviour change. Communication campaigns are vital, but they need to leave people with a clear message on what to do next.</p> <p>Unilever's work around basic hygiene provides a good example. Widespread advertising in developing world markets has raised awareness about the link between bacteria and disease. However, only by including <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/brands-in-action/detail/Lifebuoy/292086/\" title=\"\">specific messaging on the need for handwashing</a> after going to the toilet or before making food is Unilever actually contributing to a reduction in diarrhoea-related deaths.</p> <p>Trusting the messenger is a related factor in large-scale behaviour change programmes. In the UK, for instance, many homeowners have been left perplexed by the sudden array of clean energy firms that have sprung up under the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-deal\" title=\"\">Green Deal</a>. Few are accredited. The result is widespread distrust and consequent inaction.</p> <p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.energisebarnet.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Energise Barnet</a>. Based in the eponymous London borough, this community-led scheme uses trusted, quality-assured suppliers to install energy efficient improvements. The project fills the \"missing middle\" between public awareness and action, says Gemma Adams, a specialist on behaviour change at think tank Forum for the Future.</p> <p>Peer-to-peer lending initiatives such as <a href=\"http://uk.zopa.com/homepage/two?utm_expid=2529841-18&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fq%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fuk.zopa.com%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNGCBSUTcLkMIYXkvciBztQNwBeKnA\" title=\"\">Zopa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ratesetter.com/\" title=\"\">RateSetter</a> provide a similar case in point. A few years ago, few would have thought of taking a loan from a stranger. The financial crisis changed that. Banks became less trusted. The rise in social media helped too. The beauty of Facebook and Twitter and the like is that they normalise fringe ideas with exceptional speed. Take electric cars. One moment they're a fancy toy for rich eco-types. Next Justin Bieber is tweeting about them and they're \"in\".</p> <h2>Collective models</h2> <p>These examples highlight another possible avenue towards scaling behaviour change: new business models. Energise Barnet, for instance, is a community enterprise owned by local residents. Their business structure enables its 'owners' to club together to buy energy-saving technologies in bulk and at a discount.</p> <p>Such cooperative-style models are promoting collective, rather than individual, behaviour change. Therein lies the key. Neighbourhood car-sharing clubs like WhipCar and ZipCar are doing the same. <a href=\"http://swishing.com/\" title=\"\">Swishing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/Shwop/b/1672188031\" title=\"\">shwopping</a> likewise.</p> <p>\"Rather than being premised on owning an item, these models are premised on having access to an item \u2026 by [consumers] leasing or swapping rather than buying, companies offer the same benefit or more benefit as well as moving the economy in a more sustainable direction\", Adams argues.</p> <p>Another big fan of this so-called \"collaborative consumption\" as a mode of mass behaviour change is Ed Gillespie, co-director at sustainability communications firm Futerra. Companies can do a lot to increase the sustainability of their products, he argues, but the really big wins come from changing how those products are eventually used.</p> <p>\"The really enlightened thinks are mapping why the customer engages with a particular product, finding out what they get out of it and then finding an alternative to meeting that need,\" he states.</p> <p>So, to return to WhipCar and ZipCar. What's at stake here isn't the kind of car you drive, it's the basic fact of driving \u2013 or \"mobility\", as sustainability folk prefer to call it. </p> <p>\"These models are becoming more viable because they focus on what the customer gets out of it \u2026 so by offering access to a car whenever and wherever you want it, they are actively disrupting the car ownership market,\" Gillespie reasons.</p> <h2>Surprising solutions</h2> <p>Companies need to be wary of what they wish for. If sustainable mobility means people the world over start sharing vehicles, or switching to public transport, then the likes of Ford and General Motors will need a major rethink.</p> <p>Similarly, Professors Cialdini and Griskevicius might determine that one way to reduce America's landfill problem is for the US public to cook communally. Students do it. Why not everyone? That way less of SC Johnson's all-purpose kitchen cleaner would be needed and fewer empty bottles would end up in the dump.</p> <p>Such behavioural changes would hit company profits hard. That's if they stick to business-as-usual. What if consumer brands turned things on their head? Companies could start with the sustainability habits they want to see, and then design products and business models to fit. Not vice-versa as at present. A left-field idea, for sure. Until Justin Bieber tweets about it.</p> <p><em>This article forms part of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/lets-talk-sustainable-living\">Let's talk sustainable living</a>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making sustainable living mainstream.

  "<p>As Real Madrid prepare for Sunday's Cl\u00e1sico against Barcelona, they suddenly find themselves with a new weapon in midfield.</p> <p>Kak\u00e1, the 30-year-old former World Player of the Year who cost Real Madrid \u20ac67m (\u00a354m) three years ago, has been spending a surprising amount of time warming the bench.</p> <p>But on Wednesday night Jos\u00e9 Mourinho sprang a surprise by including Kak\u00e1 in the starting lineup for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/03/ajax-real-madrid-champions-league\" title=\"\">the 4-1 Champions League win at Ajax</a> and he responded with a performance full of verve and creativity.</p> <p>\"I was surprised to be starting,\" Kak\u00e1 told reporters after the match at the Amsterdam ArenA, during which he provided a delightful assist for Karim Benzema's breathtaking 48th-minute overhead kick and came close to scoring several times himself.</p> <p>\"I found out in the afternoon but at Real Madrid we all have to always be prepared to play,\" he said. \"I had a very bad time. Starting games is a personal goal and if I work hard things will come good.\"</p> <p>A victory for Bar\u00e7a in the La Liga Cl\u00e1sico at the Camp Nou would stretch their lead over their bitter rivals to 11 points and Kak\u00e1 said he was ready to play if selected in a match which could go a long way to deciding the championship.</p> <p>Mourinho said his decision to initially leave Mesut Ozil on the bench on Wednesday before deploying the German playmaker in place of Kak\u00e1 for the final 15 minutes was \"nothing definitive\".</p> <p>\"I decided that with his [Kak\u00e1's] characteristics, the nature of the opponent and the work he did during the week, it would be good for us if he played against Ajax,\" the Portuguese said.</p> <p>\"The media thinks every time a player of status is on the bench it's a big problem. My job is to think about who will play and to tease out the best performances. I have to choose 11 players and there will always be someone left out.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes I imagine a scene of a time capsule opening years after its burial, and a noxious stink arises from the urn because its socio-temporal contents have lost all their context, and thus all their meaning. \"Ew,\" says the crowd assembled, \"why ever did we bury <em>that</em>?\" Not so Hal Ashby's The Landlord, long unavailable despite being, to my mind at least, one of the most assured directorial debuts in Hollywood history, and also perhaps my favourite of all his work. I saw it as a teenager in the 70s, before it vanished out of circulation for decades. This particular time capsule is all madeleines and bitter almonds, its contents apparently not having aged a day in 42 years.</p> <p>Ashby, one of the key directors of the Hollywood renaissance of the 1970s, had an 18-year directorial career, but if he had died after the first 10 his career would have been note-perfect. Those last eight years, before his early death from cancer in 1988, saw him scorned by studios and backers as the archetypal last Hollywood hippie (Ashby can be seen in all his patchouli'd finery in the very first shot of The Landlord, at his own third, beads and kaftan-heavy, wedding that year) and a prime exemplar of the drug-fuelled 70s Hollywood that the suits wanted to get past.</p> <p>Between The Landlord and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/85217/being-there\" title=\"\">Being There</a> in 1980 Ashby offered a totally coherent artistic sensibility; his body of work both remarkably diverse, but unmistakably his own. Any film-maker who knocks seven films out of the park one after another \u2013 The Landlord, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/78471/harold-and-maude\" title=\"\">Harold and Maude</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95701/last-detail\" title=\"\">The Last Detail</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/104907/shampoo\" title=\"\">Shampoo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/105107/bound-for-glory\" title=\"\">Bound For Glory</a>, Coming Home and Being There \u2013 should have statues of himself lining Sunset Boulevard; instead, Ashby feels like he is slowly slipping from our grasp. The Landlord's reissue may, I hope, go some way to slowing that slide into oblivion.</p> <p>The Landlord tells the story of a young New York aristocrat (Beau Bridges) who buys a rundown ghetto tenement building (in Brooklyn's Park Slope, then a declining white-flight neighbourhood, now totally gentrified) with the aim of tossing out the black renters and living there alone. It represents the happy confluence of three or four exceptional talents, black and white together (most of whom died quite young) creating a still wonderfully penetrating, wise and exact meditation on race relations at the end of the 1960s.</p> <p>The most important contributor is black screenwriter Bill Gunn, adapting a 1966 novel by Kristin Hunter, also black, but adding most of the tartest lines and characterisations himself. (Try this: \"You whites scream about miscegenation and you done watered down every race you ever hated!\") Gunn, an actor and playwright who died in 1989 aged 54, should have had a proper career as a director. As The Landlord was being readied in 1969, his own major studio debut, Stop!, was shelved by an uncomprehending Warner Bros (it exists only on VHS today), which had expected blaxploitation and instead been given a thoughtful but transgressive melodrama which poetically blurred racial and sexual boundaries, and had as its protagonists two sophisticated white and black intellectual couples.</p> <p>His cult 1973 independent \"horror\" movie <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148637\" title=\"\">Ganja and Hess</a> (the only other movie starring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/93746/night-of-the-living-dead\" title=\"\">Night of the Living Dead</a>'s Duane Jones) was butchered by its distributors, who'd asked for something sub-<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/93677/blacula\" title=\"\">Blacula</a> and been given an astonishingly elliptical and incantatory Africanist tone-poem that never even mentioned vampirism. In its reassembled version it comes across as a cousin to the kind of film-making being pioneered at UCLA by Charles Burnett and the other Larry Clark (who made Passing Through) in the same period, and has been greeted, in reconstructed prints, with similar retroactively apologetic acclaim.</p> <p>The Landlord thus remains Gunn's major surviving achievement in cinema. His screenplay is predictably at home in the ghetto apartments of the renters among whom Elgar Winthrop Julius Enders comes to live, a warm and shadowy environment populated by the matriarchal Marge (the legendary Pearl Bailey, in one of her few movie roles) and by loud-mouthed, oft-incarcerated agitator Copee Johnson (Lou Gossett) and his lonely wife Francine (Diana Sands, who died at 39 in 1973). Gunn's black characters fairly sing their toothsome dialogue. Francine says to Elgar, mournfully but proudly, at one point, \"I was Miss Sepia 1957 \u2013 that's like Miss America, 'cept in colour\" \u2013 a nice line but one also, as delivered, filled with contradictory kinds of pathos for its speaker.</p> <p>And then there is cinematographer Gordon \"Prince of Darkness\" Willis, who is to his hometown of New York City what Raoul Coutard was to 60s Paris: its biographer, its poet, its painter. (Willis's camera operator/protege here was Michael Chapman, later to shoot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36313/taxi.driver\" title=\"\">Taxi Driver</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36329/raging.bull\" title=\"\">Raging Bull</a>, and Phil Kaufman's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81535/invasion.of.the.body.snatchers.-.1978.version\" title=\"\">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>) Willis gave us the sepia-toned moral murk of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36295/godfather\" title=\"\">The Godfather I</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36303/godfather-part-ii\" title=\"\">II</a> and the city-symphony of Manhattan, as well as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79376/klute\" title=\"\">Klute</a> (NYC-based) and the non-Gotham paranoia-scapes of Alan Pakula's other 70s work. Willis has always considered himself a co-author, telling the story entirely in visual terms that cohere with the film's larger narrative aims, and here he is indispensable to the film's effect. Every shadow thrown or blaze of light enriches the film's subtext and moves the movie along a little more nimbly to its inevitable conclusion (when Elgar realises he's just a clueless white tourist in the black experience, and doesn't belong).</p> <p>And then there's Ashby, tyro director. His friend Norman Jewison (for whom he'd won an Oscar editing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79409/in-the-heat-of-the-night\" title=\"\">In the Heat of the Night</a>) gave Ashby The Landlord for his directorial debut and acted as his producer. The workaholic (and everything-aholic, by many accounts) Ashby threw himself into the project, created one of his family environments on set and produced a film more deftly assembled and well argued than many other debuts. He was born fully formed as a film-maker, on the evidence available here, which I unhesitatingly put alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/95701/last-detail\" title=\"\">The Last Detail</a> as his other indisputable masterpiece.</p> <p>\u2022 The Landlord is out on DVD now</p>",
  "<p>At any of the dozens of design weeks around the world, a politician will be wheeled out on the opening night to make soothing noises about the value of design to the economy. It is doubtful, however, whether any of these events receive quite the level of political backing that <a href=\"http://www.bjdw.org/en/\" title=\"\">Beijing Design Week</a> does. At the opening ceremony last weekend, Beijing's mayor and an auditorium full of government apparatchiks applauded through a televised marathon of speeches, bouquet presentations and dance performances. What did all this pomp signify? That design deserves the full treatment of the Communist party propaganda machine.</p> <p>In 2006, China's premiere, Hu Jintao, famously declared that he wanted to see the country move from \"made in China\" to \"designed in China\". That top-level rhetoric has resulted in a wave of design weeks, biennials, museums and, above all, educational institutions. With 1,500 dedicated courses, China has more design students than any country in the world.</p> <p>The problem is that it also prompts a \"how far have they got?\" probing from western observers keen to look beyond the cliches of Chinese design \u2013 cliches about a culture of copying and a lack of independent thinking. Even among Chinese designers, the implicit pressure from on high is engendering a spiel fatigue. \"We want to forget about this 'made in China/designed in China' slogan and just get on with it,\" says designer <a href=\"http://naihanli.com/\" title=\"\">Naihan Li</a>. And get on with it they have.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://places.designobserver.com/feature/caochangdi-and-the-demolition-of-beijing-art-villages/33678/\" title=\"\">Caochangdi, a district renowned for its community of artists and designers</a>, Li has opened up her home to exhibit her Crate series of furniture. Everything from her sofa to her entertainment system is designed as a foldable crate so she can move house at the drop of a hat. With Caochangdi under threat of demolition, it's a comment on the migratory life of a young creative in a city that is developing too fast for a stable domesticity. Of course, by redeveloping such creative neighbourhoods the government is working against its own policy of nurturing new talent, but there you go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397191976\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/10/4/1349365156300/Urban-Carpets-part-of-the-010.jpg\" alt=\"Urban Carpets, part of the Instant Hutong project by Marcella Campa and Stefano Avesani\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Streets ahead ... Urban Carpets, part of the Instant Hutong project by Marcella Campa and Stefano Avesani</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In one of the neighbouring blocks of Caochangdi, two Beijing-based Italian architects are taking on similar issues. Marcella Campa and Stefano Avesani have been mapping the city's hutongs, the traditional alleyways that are rapidly being demolished to make way for highrises. Turning their maps into carpets, they've been hanging them in hutong neighbourhoods so that residents can see a streetscape that is too fine-grained to feature on official maps, and may disappear before they ever do.</p> <p>One such neighbourhood is <a href=\"http://dashilar.org/\" title=\"\">Dashilar</a>, an area near Tiananmen Square that the government is actually interested in preserving. For Beijing Design Week it is hosting dozens of pop-up exhibitions by local and international designer-makers. There's an interesting exhibition of zine culture \u2013 with the government monitoring the internet so closely, hand-printed pamphlets appear to be flourishing. Indeed, most of the work in Dashilar has a craft dimension to it. There is no industrial or product design, nor any sign of China's fearsome manufacturing muscle.</p> <p>The same is true at the <a href=\"http://e.751info.com/news/english-home/index.html\" title=\"\">751 design park</a>, a former power plant in the famous 798 cultural district. Here the emphasis is on reinterpretations of Ming chairs and other traditional Chinese furniture. It is not the stuff of a thrusting nation with ambitions to be a global design powerhouse. You wonder whether the clapping politicos at the opening ceremony knew what an embryonic and craft-orientated scene they were pumping up.</p> <p>Given that Beijing Design Week's self-proclaimed goal is to develop home-grown industries, brands and talent, it would have been encouraging to see more links being fostered between young designers and Chinese manufacturers. Or is it still true, as Lorraine Justice notes in her book China's Design Revolution, that most Chinese clients only want \"copies of products that have been successful on the market instead of orders for fresh \u2026 untested products\"? Or perhaps BJDW is symptomatic of China's highly regionalised design cultures, with industrial design focused in the southern cities of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and branding and domestic products located in Shanghai? Beijing, in contrast, is better known as a centre of art, furniture and fashion.</p> <p>\"The difference between the regions can be quite stark,\" says Aric Chen, BJDW's American-Chinese creative director. \"And Beijing has a higher degree of consciousness about what Chinese culture is. Designers here are really asking themselves how to express traditional applied arts and philosophy in a new way. China spent a lot of time destroying its own culture, and it's still rediscovering what it used to be and figuring out what it means now.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397191977\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Archive/Search/2012/10/4/1349364917247/Paper-pulp-chairs-designe-010.jpg\" alt=\"Paper-pulp chairs designed by Chinese design studio Pinwu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hot seat ... paper-pulp chairs designed by Chinese design studio Pinwu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The luckiest of these designers may get to sell their wares at Wuhao, an exclusive boutique hidden in the hutongs of the Dongcheng district. Occupying a courtyard house that belonged to the last empress, Wuhao only sells work by Chinese designers and caters to a new elite's taste for luxury that is less cliched than Swiss watches and Italian furniture. Here you'll find delicate flatware and searching furniture, such as Xiao Tianyu's Ming-style chair backs plunged into soft poufs, or <a href=\"http://www.pinwu.net/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Pinwu</a>'s paper-pulp chairs.</p> <p>And what of the tens of thousands of design students graduating in China every year? At the <a href=\"http://www.cafa.edu.cn/aboutcafa/lan/?c=1101\" title=\"\">Central Academy of Fine Arts</a>, Beijing's top design school, I meet Fei Jun, an associate professor who runs the media lab. His interaction design students produce slick iPad apps and go on to get good jobs, but he worries that most graduates are not so lucky. In fact, one of the reasons why design is the second most popular subject in the country is that the standard of entry is so low. \"We joke that even some medical schools have design departments,\" says Jun. On the other hand, he says, \"We can joke about it but we're seeing progress, and that's why we're optimistic.\"</p> <p>As any interaction designer would, Jun finds BJDW a little conservative for his tastes but he's encouraged by the way a younger generation of designers is getting involved. And it is clear that the event privileges a young scene \u2013 many of these designers are still in their 20s, and are keen to shake off any stereotypes being imposed on them, either by westerners or the Communist party. More independent-minded than their predecessors, this is China's design future. And things are moving fast here. \"The change even since I came here four years ago is really dramatic,\" says Chen.</p>",
  "<p>A catalogue of failures in how England's farmers prevent their cattle spreading TB between herds was uncovered by <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/act_getPDF.cfm?PDF_ID=9444\" title=\"\">an official European Commission inspection</a>, the Guardian has learned, undermining the case for the imminent cull of badgers.</p> <p>The previously unreported document was highlighted as government body <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2012/041012.aspx\" title=\"\">Natural England issued a licence for a pilot cull in west Somerset on Thursday</a>, following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england\" title=\"\">last month's granting of a licence to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire</a>.</p> <p>The government and the National Farmers' Union (NFU) claim the cull is necessary to curb the rising number of tuberculosis infections in cattle. But cull opponents said it was \"utterly outrageous\" that badgers were paying the price for some farmers flouting biosecurity measures.</p> <p>Cattle in England must be regularly tested for TB, and those found to have the disease must be quickly isolated and then removed. But the EC report, based on inspections made in September 2011, found numerous \"shortcomings\", including missed targets on both the rapid removal of cattle with TB and the follow-up of missed tests, and \"weaknesses in cleaning and disinfection at farm, vehicle, market and slaughterhouse levels, exacerbated by lack of adequate supervision\". All these problems increase the risk of TB spreading between cattle.</p> <p>The EC gave the UK \u20ac23m in 2011 for bovine TB control measures. Its inspectors found that the removal of cattle with TB was below the target of 90% in 10 days, and that in the first half of 2011 more than 1,000 cattle had not been removed after 30 days. They found that there were 3,300 overdue TB tests as of May 2011 and that \"many\" calf passports \u2013 used to track movements \u2013 were incomplete. They also found that only 56% disease report forms had been completed on time, with the authorities blaming lack of resources. Funding cuts were cited as the reason for the failure of local authorities to update central databases systematically.</p> <p>The EC report stated: \"Local authority surveys provided evidence that some cattle farmers may have been illegally swapping cattle ear tags, ie retaining TB-positive animals in their herds and sending less productive animals to slaughter in their place.\" There are 8.5 million cattle in Great Britain on 81,000 holdings, with 2.4m movements a year. In 2011, about 7% of herds were under restriction due to TB and 26,000 cattle were destroyed.</p> <p>Mark Jones, a vet and executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/world/united_kingdom/news/news/2012/09/badger_team_091912.html\" title=\"\">Humane Society International UK</a>, said: \"It is cattle, not badgers, that are the main transmitters of bovine TB so it is utterly outrageous for badgers to pay the price for farmers' failure to abide by proper biosecurity measures.\".</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/.../atoz/tb/isg/report/final_report.pdf\" title=\"\">landmark study in 2008</a> of badger culling as a way of controlling bovine TB concluded it could make \"no meaningful contribution\", with its leader, Prof John Bourne, telling the government: \"Scientific findings indicate the rising incidence of disease can be reversed by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone.\"</p> <p>A Defra spokesman said: \"Measures to reduce the risk of bovine TB being spread between cattle were strengthened this year as part of the government's plan to eradicate the disease in England, including tightening regulations around the movement and testing of cattle. Scientific evidence tells us that we cannot successfully eradicate bovine TB without also addressing the problem in wildlife, which is why a cull of badgers is needed.\" The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/fvo/act_getPDFannx.cfm?ANX_ID=6599\" title=\"\">government accepted</a> most of the recommendations made by the EC inspectors.</p> <p>An NFU spokesman said: \"Cattle controls have been strengthened by Defra since this report was released. We understand steps may be taken to strengthen these in January 2013.</p> <p>\"We hope these moves, alongside the pilot badger culls, and the development of badger and cattle vaccines, will help control the disease and eventually eradicate it.\"</p> <p>Jones said ministers must wait and assess the impact of tighter biosecurity: \"There is some evidence from west Wales, where the measures have been tightened up, that TB in cattle is coming down. There needs to be time to see if there has been an impact, before going ahead with a massacre of badgers.\" Bovine TB in Wales, which has rejected badger culling, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN06081.pdf\" title=\"\">has fallen since 2008</a>.</p> <p>David Fisher, a Defra-funded TB inspector in Wales until 2011, said: \"It is an open secret that isolation of [TB] reactors and inconclusive reactors is rare.\" Fisher said Defra's own database showed that in 2009 there was 20.8% non-compliance for bovine TB issues and that there was only one instance that year of a dairy farm being checked for compliance with an isolation notice.</p> <p>The government argues that the landmark study shows a 12-16% reduction in TB infections could be achieved if 70% of all badgers in a large area are killed for at least four consecutive areas. But opponents say that argument does not hold up because different methods would be used in the proposed culls, which could ultimately kill 100,000 badgers \u2013 a third of the national population.</p> <p>Prof Graham Medley, at the University of Warwick, told the Guardian the only way to eradicate TB in cattle would be a return to the strict and effective controls in place 40 years ago. \"There is no scientific underpinning for the proposed killing of badgers.\"</p> <p>Time is running out to begin the culling this year, as it must continue for six weeks, but badgers spend little time above ground in the winter months. The granting of the licence for Somerset on Thursday, however, has removed the main final hurdle for the trials to go ahead.</p> <p>The cull has prompted widespread opposition from animal and wildlife groups and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/01/badger-activists-prepare-for-cull\" title=\"\">protests are expected</a> at the cull sites during the night-time shoots. Senior police authorities have expressed their fears for public safety, and this week Gloucestershire Constabulary said it had cancelled all leave for its officers until January.</p> <p>Gloucestershire Police Federation, which represents officers, responded by warning its members had had limited leave this summer due to the Olympics and were tired. Chairman Tracy De Young said: \"We are concerned that as fatigue takes hold mistakes will be made and accidents will occur. At worst, my fear is that the longer the leave ban goes on, the worse the situation will become, until the unthinkable happens and we have a fatal incident.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">A petition on the government's website opposing the badger cull</a> now has 146,000 signatures and several MPs have told the Guardian they are confident they will win a debate in parliament on the issue.</p>",
  "<p>The British foreign secretary and the Archbishop of Westminster have joined forces in opposing the route of Israel's vast barrier along the West Bank, which adversely affects a community of monks, nuns and Christian families near Bethlehem.</p> <p>In a private letter seen by the Guardian, William Hague told Archbishop Vincent Nichols that he shared his \"concerns about the problem of land confiscation by the Israeli authorities affecting the people of Beit Jala and similar Palestinian communities in the occupied territories\".</p> <p>The letter suggested that the religious orders in Beit Jala needed to give a \"clear signal\" of opposition to the barrier's route to bolster a legal case against the state of Israel. Shortly afterwards, the monks joined the legal challenge. A ruling in the case is expected by the end of this year.</p> <p>In addition to Hague's personal intervention, the British consulate in East Jerusalem is supporting the community and the Department for International Development (Dfid) is providing indirect funding for the legal challenge.</p> <p>The consulate is championing the case as a symbolic example of the impact of the separation barrier on Palestinian communities and the loss of Palestinian land. Around 85% of the barrier is inside the West Bank.</p> <p>British government policy is that Israel is entitled to build a barrier but it should lie on the internationally recognised 1967 Green Line, not on confiscated Palestinian land. It is concerned that the route is harming the prospects of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> <p>Dfid has given a two-year grant of \u00a32.9m to the Norwegian Refugee Council, which in turn is funding the Society of St Yves, a Jerusalem-based Catholic human rights organisation, which is assisting the Beit Jala community with its case.</p> <p>The Archbishop of Westminster, England's most senior Catholic, espoused the case of the Cremisan monastery and convent, and their surrounding Palestinian Christian community, in Beit Jala following a visit last November. In<a href=\"http://www.thetablet.co.uk/blogs/222/18\" title=\"\"> last year's Christmas Eve homily</a>, two days after the date of Hague's letter, the archbishop offered prayers for the community's \"legal battle to protect their land and homes from further expropriation by Israel\".</p> <p>He went on: \"Over 50 families face losing their land and their homes as action is taken to complete the separation/security wall across the territory of the district of Bethlehem. We pray for them tonight.\"</p> <p>Nichols's principal concern was to ensure that the Christian presence in the Holy Land was preserved, his spokesman told the Guardian. \"The numbers are dwindling. The archbishop is trying to encourage and give succour to Christian communities. The imposition of this wall will jeopardise the livelihoods of many of the families.\"</p> <p>Nichols was aware that \"sensitivities are high,\" the spokesman added.</p> <p>Beit Jala has a population of around 10,000, more than 80% of whom are Christian.</p> <p>Under the current Israeli plan, the barrier will run between the monastery and convent, separating the two establishments and cutting off the monks from the local Christian community. It will also separate the convent and more than 50 families from land they own.</p> <p>As part of the campaign against the barrier's route, a mass is conducted each Friday by Beit Jala's parish priest, Father Ibrahim Shomali, under olive trees overlooking the Cremisan valley. \"This is Palestinian land,\" he said. \"If Israel wants to build a wall, they should put it on their own land.\"</p> <p>Many Palestinian Christians have emigrated as a result of the economic impact of the separation barrier which has already been built around the city of Bethlehem and its nearby villages. Residents have difficulty in accessing their land and exporting their produce. The hurdles in reaching Christian holy sites in Jerusalem is another factor encouraging them to leave.</p> <p>\"People are migrating because of the situation. There is no work, and living costs are high,\" said Samira Qaisieh, 47, whose stone house with views across the valley has belonged to her husband's family since it was built almost 100 years ago. \"If the situation stays as it is, I'm also thinking of leaving with my children.\"</p> <p>The terraces around Cremisan, on which Palestinian families picnic at weekends under olive and fruit trees, are overlooked by two Israeli settlements, Gilo and Har Gilo. Critics of the barrier say its intention is to take these settlements and as much of the surrounding land as possible onto the Israeli side in what is in effect a land grab.</p> <p>In 2004, the International Court of Justice <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/09/israelandthepalestinians.unitednations\" title=\"\">ruled that the route of Israel's barrier on Palestinian territory breached international law</a> and was \"tantamount to de facto annexation\".</p> <p>According to Israel's ministry of defence, \"the route of the security fence in the Beit Jala region is based purely on security considerations. This portion \u2026 is there solely to keep terror out of Jerusalem.\" In a lengthy statement, the MoD recalled events of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in which \"Jerusalem was the prime target of a brutal Palestinian terror campaign; suicide bombings, shootings, and stabbings were weekly, and sometimes daily occurrences\".</p> <p>It said it was co-ordinating the route of the barrier with the local community, would provide an gate to allow access to land, and would pay compensation for land taken for the barrier's construction.</p> <p>The ministry said the monks had initially requested to stay on the Israeli side of the barrier, and had only latterly demanded to be on the Palestinian side.</p> <p>According to one source, the monks \u2013 who produce Palestine's only wine, under the Cremisan label \u2013 changed their stance following pressure from the Catholic hierarchy. Initially they believed being on the Israeli side of the barrier would give them continued access to the Israeli market for their wine, the source said.</p> <p>Representatives of the monastery, whose presence at Cremisan dates back to 1891, declined to speak to the Guardian. However, after reports surfaced of tensions between the nuns and the monks over the route of the barrier, they issued a joint statement earlier this year \"clearly affirm[ing] there is no discord among them whatsoever and that their positions with regard to building the 'wall' do not differ\". The two religious communities, part of the Salesian order, \"enjoy excellent relations and mutual respect\", it added.</p> <p>The half-dozen elderly nuns at the convent have objected to the barrier's route since first being notified six years ago. Under the present proposal, the convent's premises will abut the barrier. The playground of a kindergarten and school, run by the sisters for more than 50 years and catering for almost 400 Christian and Muslim children, will be overlooked by military watchtowers, and 75% of land owned by the convent will be on the other side of the barrier.</p> <p>Manal Hazzan-Abu Sinni, a lawyer representing the nuns, said they were accustomed to a secluded lifestyle, and unfamiliar with legal procedures. \"They feel there has been a great deal of intrusion into their day-to-day lives. From a remote, serene, spiritual place, they've become the focus of news and had to deal with a great feeling of uncertainty regarding the future,\" she said. \"They're not used to dealing with such issues.\"</p> <p>Yigal Palmor, spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, said the involvement of a foreign government in a legal battle against another government was \"very odd\".</p>",

  "<p>The question \"Should literature be political?\" is timeless, and best approached not with a view to finding definitive, timeless answers, but to opening our minds as to why we might be asking it yet again.</p> <p>In Africa, it was asked in the 1960 and 1970s during anti-colonial struggles against British, French, and Portuguese colonialism. In South Africa, particularly from the time of the 1976 youth uprising, it was posed again. Its urgency increased during the state of emergency in the mid-1980s when the apartheid regime escalated its repression. The drama of conflict at that time was clear: from a moral point of view, the state represented evil, oppressing black citizens, who joined with increasing numbers of sympathetic white South Africans in representing good.</p> <p>No dramatic conflict could have been more defined. It had the clarity of a soap opera: strong bold lines of action and little subtlety. Mass protests, mass arrests and killings; mass poverty of the many; extreme wealth for the few; the enormous power of the state in defence of a small population of whites ranged against an enormous powerless labour reservoir of black people. In this situation, the call for literature was to be one of the \"weapons of struggle\". Writers became known as \"cultural workers\". Poetry flourished, particularly in performance, where the evocative power of words and images combined with the physical language of the body to create an intense immediacy.</p> <p>And the end of it all was as heroically peaceful as the repression and resistance that brought it about had been violent. The formal handing over of the instruments of state to the new government of Mandela occurred with all the pageantry of spectacle: the swearing in of the new president and the fly-past of military aircraft with four helicopters bearing the new flag had thousands gasping and shedding a tear. A film with a good ending. But there may have been a price!</p> <p>During the state of emergency, when the question of whether literature should be political enjoyed some currency, it was asked as the struggles against violent oppression themselves took on some violent forms of expression. The complex reasons behind the quest for freedom, and the ethical values which justified that quest, seemed in danger of being reduced to nothing more than escalating acts of vengeance.</p> <p>The call to reflect on such questions invited some impatience, and even charges of betrayal. In difficult moments of transition, reductive simplification my trump complexity and nuance.</p> <p>It is as if moral complexity \u2013 a major source of literary value \u2013 is contrasted with political agency, whose capacity for reductive simplification may devalue the complicating&#xa0;tendencies of literature.</p> <p>But non-political literature can be intensely political not so much in its postures but in the expressive value it earns through exploding simplification.</p> <p>In The African Child, first published in 1954, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/camara-laye\" title=\"\">Camara Laye</a> wrote about an African boy growing in a village in Guinea. In ever expanding circles of experience, he passes from the innocence of a village child to &#xa0;a world citizen living in France. In the evocation of a life ideologically degraded by colonialism, Laye \u2013 and later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/chinua-achebe\" title=\"\">Chinua Achebe</a> \u2013 &#xa0;delineated ways of life that had their sense of self: an identity that did not require justification. In a colonial environment, such a literary rendering of African life was a radical act of self-assertion.</p> <p>Published in 1960, God's Bits of Wood, by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousmane_Semb%C3%A8ne\" title=\"\">Ousmane Sembene</a> tells of a strike by railway workers along the line between Bamako in Mali to Dakar in Senegal. Self-evidently heroic in character, it nevertheless does more than depict worker heroism. At the same time that the workers are engaged in a struggle symbolic of the wider anti-colonial project, we also see them in their entire human landscape, often times complicating, at other times demeaning, even when judged by their own actions.</p> <p>These two books reveal the continuum between political literature and literary politics. Both achieve transcendence through art that politicises and depoliticises all at once.</p> <p>The risk of moral devaluation may increase even as legitimate political struggle gains momentum and draws closer to &#xa0;the humanistic goals for which it was waged. How are ethical and moral values to be rescued when children stand in a circle around a woman they have set alight after denouncing her as a collaborator, as happened in the 1980s? One can only urge closer attention to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/william-golding\" title=\"\"> William Golding</a>'s Lord of the Flies, that most political of all non-political novels.</p> <p>Much later, it was established that the murdered woman was not a collaborator at all, the imagined offence which had brought her death. At a tragically painful moment we rediscover human folly and remember why we call for and endeavour to create fair political and legal processes to mitigate that folly.</p> <p>There isn't a great deal in South Africa that can be called \"political literature\" in the sense of a literature that dramatises political activism. We are more likely to see literature that \"politicises\" by deepening of awareness, &#xa0;as in Camara Laye's book. Who really, are the people who voted for democracy in 1994? Who and what have they become since then? Different answers are emerging.</p> <p>Many tell their stories through biography or autobiography, \"setting the record straight\" through the \"facts\" of their lives. Others, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/kopano-matlwa\" title=\"\">Kopano Matlwa</a> in Coconut, challenge new prejudices held by some of South Africa's new citizens about other fellow citizens. So do <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/zukiswa-wanner\" title=\"\">Zukiswa Wanner</a>'s characters in her Men of the South, some of whom grapple with their hidden sexualities. Car-jackers in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/sifiso-mzobe\" title=\"\">Sifiso Mzobe</a>'s Young Blood&#xa0;have an intriguing human face. Their lives are subject to a code of conduct whose ethics disturbingly resembles those of \"normal society\".</p> <p>Perhaps partly through literature in its deeply reflective politics, the politics of texture, we live in the time of literature that politicises as it depoliticises. I am thinking of a book: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/literary-criticism/9780674061194/slow-violence-and-the-environmentalism-of-the-poor\" title=\"\">Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor </a>by Rob Nixon. It is not a novel. But its compelling message makes a strong case for our times.</p> <p>The aim of&#xa0;this book to make us aware of pervasive yet hidden acts of large scale on-going violence whose impact will be devastating in the future: the violence of environmental degradation; of corruption; of the depreciation of morality through weak and uncultivated leadership. \"Assaults on a nation's environmental resources frequently entail not just the physical displacement of local communities, but their imaginative displacement as well\u2026\" It is such \"imaginative displacement\" that leads to public blindness.</p> <p>To counter such contemporary tendencies, we need writing that explodes willed invisibility so that we can see with an awareness that recognises the dangerous present, and at the same time enables us to project our minds and our imaginations far into the future to prevent current trends from turning into tragedy in the long term.</p> <p>This kind of reflective capacity could very well be one of the fundamental values of modern society. It is the source of responsibility, compassion, tolerance, endurance, patience, and beauty. Africa has to cultivate it with an urgency that must permeate the entire political and social life of a continent increasingly impatient and desperate for renewal.</p> <p>And so, why do we ask this question again, at this time? Should literature be political? Maybe we sense the need for a kind of reflective activism whose coherence only literature may render with some believable conviction. Maybe we yearn for renewal.</p> <p><em>This is an edited version of Njabulo S Ndebele's keynote speech at Open Book Cape Town.

  "<p><strong>What are the aims and interests of University Alliance (UA)?</strong></p> <p>Universities Alliance represents 24 universities which are business-connected and business-focused. Our members include the large ex-polytechnics, and also universities that are very regionally located; we often work with industry sectors that are relevant to the region. We have a focus on placement opportunities, asking industry experts what graduate skills sets they are looking for, and what knowledge they require. We have lots of conversations with treasury ministers, and are working very closely with <a href=\"http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">Universities UK</a> to make sure that we present a solution-focused approach to our commentary.</p> <p><strong>How much, as both a vice-chancellor and the chair of UA, has the policy environment and also the economic environment in which universities now operate shaped what you do?</strong></p> <p>The policy context that we are currently working with is concerned with the here and now, but universities play a very long game in terms of creating futures and opportunities. I have been trying to paint a picture of higher education that acknowledges where we are at the moment, but also recognises that the knowledge economy is the economy that we are trying to grow. That means challenging future areas of investment as a country, looking for more graduates and more highly skilled workers, and changing the profile of what our workforce in the UK looks like.</p> <p>My disappointment is that the focus [of policy] has been negative \u2013 worrying about fees and how to control student numbers. In the short term this is hugely important, but we need to be having a conversation about our longer term provisions and plans. How do we create a workforce who are able to engage with the changing world, a workforce that has the knowledge, skills and attributes to allow them to be flexible, and who are entrepreneurial in their approach and who can change over time, and who can build future economies? That in itself is a big challenge.</p> <p><strong>Is that a challenge that transcends </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/26/mission-groups-university-branding\" title=\"\"><strong>mission groups</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>There is one authoritative voice for universities in Britain, and that is Universities UK. The role of the mission groups is to celebrate the diversity of UK higher education, and to profile it to policy makers and the public. If additional variability is introduced through public-private partnerships, it must be clear that they are governed and must meet all of the current requirements for existing universities.</p> <p>Mission groups have an important role to play, and where they tend to challenge each other is where policy that is being developed advantages or disadvantages any particular group. For example, UA is quite clear in that research excellence should be funded regardless of the institution or mission group. World class research is world class research, whether it is occurring in a research-intensive university or in another other sort of university.</p> <p><strong>University Alliance's latest project, </strong><a href=\"http://universityvision.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>university-vision</strong></a><strong>, aims to break down the divides between mission groups. Can you elaborate on how this might be done?</strong></p> <p>The future of learning, teaching and research is too important to be polarised by differences in views between mission groups. We've created a project which sets out, first and foremost, not to be something that is just owned by UA and havee held meetings which were purposely cut across mission groups. There needs to be a dialogue with policy thinkers, policy makers and the public around what the purpose of a university is, how we want to fund university education in the future, and how we want universities to behave \u2013 both with each other and with industry \u2013 going forward. The aim of this was to try and form some scenarios which could be used to challenge current thinking in higher education.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any sense of how well these ideas are being received within the sector?</strong></p> <p>Those who are engaging with it think it is really interesting. Now, we want to have something out there that people can engage with, that explains both what we are trying to do and the work we have done so far. We have a website, through which people can <a href=\"http://universityvision.org.uk/contribute/\" title=\"\">contribute to the thinking around these scenarios</a>. We also want to influence some of the thinking in the run-up to the next general election, in 2015.</p> <p><strong>So is that the point at which we can measure the success of university-vision \u2013 by the influence it's had on the party line regarding higher education?</strong></p> <p>Yes. By that point, we will also see how far we have moved on from the current debate, which is preoccupied with student number control and funding. The important thing, again, is that we start to think about the long term future, and we don't get caught up in only worrying about what's going to happen in the next one or two years.</p> <p><strong>Is that your message to university leaders: focus on the long term and not the short?</strong></p> <p>Politics is rooted in today and it's important that we focus on getting the here and now right for our students and staff. However, universities have been around a long time, but political parties come and go. Universities need to continually challenge themselves in terms of what they are about and what they do, but we also need to acknowledge that we are about knowledge creation, knowledge application, and through that, improving the health and welfare of our nation.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<h2><a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Even a passable performance was going to earn Romney hosannas'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201289\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/5/1/1335856877642/michael-cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"michael cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">michael cohen Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wednesday's debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama can be summed up by one moment. Early on, the president accused Romney of wanting to put in place a $5tn tax cut that will, he claimed, blow up the deficit and curtail spending.</p> <p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/presidential-debate-transcript-denver-colo-oct/story?id=17390260&amp;singlePage=true#.UG0SV_lXt8s\">Romney denied he has a plan</a> of such magnitude; that it would \"reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans\"; or that it would even widen the deficit. Why, you might ask? Because, according to Romney, he would \"lower deductions and exemptions and credits \u2026 so we keep getting the revenue we need.\" In other words, don't worry about all that lost revenue: I'm going to make some other changes to the tax code. It all sounded quite reasonable.</p> <p>The problem, however, is that it isn't plausible. A <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/03/debate-fact-check_n_1937831.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">20% across-the-board tax cut</a> <em>will</em> cut taxes for the wealthy and it almost certainly will increase the deficit, especially since Romney also wants to spend trillions more on defense and hasn't indicated any significant spending cuts that he supports.</p> <p>This is the deception lurking behind Romney's economic plan. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/url.cfm?ID=1001628\">according to the Tax Policy Center</a>, it's mathematically impossible to close enough loopholes to make Romney's tax cut plan deficit neutral. Thus, the obvious rejoinder to Romney's assertions is to ask him point blank: \"OK, Governor Romney, what loopholes would you cut? What deductions would you remove from the tax code? Would you get rid of the mortgage interest deduction?\"</p> <p>Barack Obama, for some inexplicable reason, didn't ask those questions.</p> <p>Romney's lack of policy specifics is his most obvious glass jaw. On the one hand, if unchallenged, it gives Romney the opportunity to sound credible and sensible \u2013 everyone sounds more reasonable on the issue of tax cuts when they don't have to delve into details. On the other hand, it allows Obama to test Romney's credibility or fill in the blanks himself \u2013 as Obama tried to do by claiming that Romney's plan would likely result in higher middle-class taxes.</p> <p>Yet, Obama didn't take advantage \u2013 seeming, instead, content to play defense and avoid getting in the muck with Romney. While the media hysteria over Obama's lackluster performance is overstated, this strategy was a big political mistake. </p> <p>Reporters are desperate for the race to tighten and with expectations for Romney as low as can be imagined, even a passable performance was going to earn him hosannas. That Romney gave a rather strong performance and Obama was so passive, created the perfect opportunity for the press to tout the \"Romney resurgence\" meme and give him the big debate \"win\" that he needed.</p> <p>Considering the deep polarization of the electorate \u2013 and that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney-won-debate-win-election\">debates rarely change the trajectory of a race</a> \u2013 last night is likely not going to have a huge impact on the campaign. But this was a significant and unnecessary bump in the road.</p> <p>Being likable is all well and good, but sometimes, you have to go on the offensive. If your opponent throws you a fastball down the middle of the plate \u2013 as Romney did on his tax cutting plans \u2013 take a swing.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/cheri-jacobus\">Cheri Jacobus</a>: 'Barack Obama didn't want to be there'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201290\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/3/1325610796868/cherijacobus_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Cheri Jacobus\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The body language told the story.<br>&#xa0;<br>Governor Romney spoke directly to President Obama, making it clear how his policies had failed these past four years, and gave a robust explanation of his vision and plans to create jobs and grow the economy. Obama couldn't look him in the eye. He looked down at his notes, knowing he was being taken to the woodshed, and rightfully so. There was no teleprompter to save him.</p> <p>President Obama acted as though someone else had been in the White House these past four years, and offered a scatter-brained professorial presentation of theory, with nothing to brag about from his presidency. Mitt Romney, meanwhile, hit all the right notes on Obamacare, while the president smirked and looked at his feet. </p> <p>Romney reminded America that Obamacare does, in fact, establish a board that will ultimately decide on treatment options. While Obama tried to convince us all that Obamacare was not a government takeover of healthcare, he was unconvincing \u2013 he didn't even seem to believe what he was saying.</p> <p>And kudos to Governor Romney for calling Obama out on passing the most massive piece of legislation in history without a single vote from the other party \u2013 something that no president had ever done. Even in the most partisan and rancorous of times in Washington, there was enough respect for the two-party system and voters to avoid such an arrogant and autocratic move. It is the chief reason voters threw out so many members of Congress from Obama's party in 2010 and put Republicans in charge of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>It's not an understatement to say Romney wiped the floor with Obama: even moderator Jim Lehrer was tougher than Obama was. Mitt Romney connected with voters. Barack Obama didn't want to be there.</p> <p>President Obama has a record now, and it's not one of hope and change. He knows it. And it showed.</p> <p>While many journalists were tweeting their boredom after it became apparent this was a blowout for Romney, there was one person who was even more eager than them for the debate to end. President Obama couldn't wait for the night to be over. </p> <p>I am looking forward to the debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan.</p> <p><em>Cheri Jacobus is a Republican consultant and strategist</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nancy-goldstein\">Nancy Goldstein</a>: 'Obama can't show up for 40 million viewers vibing like Eeyore'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201291\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/6/8/1307540115667/nancygoldstein_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Goldstein\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dear Obama Debate Prep Team,</p> <p>Sorry, dudes: you must feel like hell after last night. If the standard for comparison is \"Who best accomplished what he came to do?\", then this was clearly Romney's round.</p> <p>Sure, it was a lopsided fight. Romney has been looking and sounding like Vlad the Impaler for so long that all he had to do to exceed expectations was show up acting like someone who doesn't sleep in a crypt; strike a pose from the Ronald Reagan Compassionate Conservative playbook; spit out a few numbers; and seem puzzled by all of those, er, <em>rumors</em> about his plans to cut taxes for the rich and roll the rest of us back to serfdom.</p> <p>Some of Obama's gaffes can easily be fixed. Remind him to stand up straight and look directly into the camera. Get him more sleep, or cop some Adderall: the guy can't show up in front of 40 million viewers vibing like Eeyore.</p> <p>Revive Obama's ability to explain complex topics lucidly and, most importantly, fix his tone. It's all that dogs, students, and the average listener take away from most encounters \u2013 especially when confronted with a debate so teeth-grindingly filled with minutiae at the same time that it was so head-bangingly short on specifics.</p> <p>Romney sounded friendly and reasonable on the surface, where it counts most. Obama, by contrast, sounded petulant and tense, which is where he goes when he's feeling defensive, under-appreciated, or like the Smartest Guy in the Room, which is often \u2013 and never more so than when discussing the economy.</p> <p>I'm sure that the presidency is hell on a stick. But at a time of stagnant wages, rising costs, and high unemployment, Obama should expect to have to keep defending his policies. End of story. </p> <p>Now man up and get back into the game.</p> <p><em>Nancy Goldstein is a progressive writer and communications strategist </em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-wissot\">Michael Wissot</a>: 'Voters are seeing a deficit in confidence from President Obama'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201292\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/4/1325692835573/michaelwissot_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Wissot\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Mitt Romney's debate performance last night was nothing short of masterful. His readiness proved that a contentious primary is the best way to prime a nominee for the grandest stage.</p> <p>Romney has learned through each debate experience that every attack requires a direct response. Otherwise, perception quickly becomes reality.</p> <p>Barack Obama unleashed his offensive ammunition early \u2013 accusing Romney of pushing a $5tn tax cut, a $250,000 tax break for the wealthy, and a $2,000 tax hike for middle-class families. Some politicians make a mistake here by defending their plan. Romney, instead, made clear commitments against such accusations, essentially squashing the president's momentum. </p> <p>Romney needed to define himself on his own terms, and he did just that. He expressed shared goals with the president, but clearly differentiated his vision. He defended his principles with substance and conviction while maintaining a respectful tone.</p> <p>The opening topics \u2013 jobs, taxes and the federal deficit \u2013 all played to Romney's strengths. It allowed him to personalize the frustration and disappointment that Americans are feeling over the economy. It shifted the litmus test to the president's record. And it exposed President Obama's lack of focus and preparation for this match-up.</p> <p>Romney's unflappable gamesmanship will not go unnoticed, particularly among swing voters. He seized the high ground on bipartisanship, contrasting his success with Democrats in Massachusetts to the president's struggles with congressional Republicans.</p> <p>President Obama assumed a \"not to lose strategy\", but it reaffirmed his inherent weakness and disdain for debates, particularly as an incumbent. He almost appeared shocked that Romney would challenge him.</p> <p>Voters expected a much stronger performance from the president, whose arguments were circuitous and aimless. He resisted eye contact, looking down whenever Romney spoke to him. His delivery was choppy. And he appeared genuinely agitated whenever Romney refuted and redefined the president's claims. </p> <p>For the first time, voters are seeing a deficit in confidence from President Obama.</p> <p>Sometimes, the simplest of language, even pronouns, can be quite telling. When debating John McCain in 2008, President Obama excessively used \"we\" (instead of \"I\") as a rallying cry to join his crusade. Four years later, he used \"we\" to explain his record and decisions, almost removing any direct accountability. It revealed a lack of ownership over his presidency.</p> <p>The president's advisers face a dilemma: if they don't allow him to take ownership, they are stripping him of any confidence in himself or his presidency. Without that familiar confidence, President Obama may see his lead quickly dissipate.</p> <p><em>Michael Wissot is a senior strategist for Luntz Global </em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'This was Romney's most comfortable, natural performance of his candidacy'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201293\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Between his past performances in GOP primary debates and his considerable amount of time spent in debate prep, smart observers expected Mitt Romney to be at least pretty good Wednesday night. Instead, he hit it out of the park: his most comfortable, most exceptionally detailed, natural performance of his candidacy.</p> <p>Clearly, the early word that Romney would offer \"zingers\" was a misdirection, as he avoided most cutesy or canned lines. Instead, he focused on coming across as \"the man with the plan\".</p> <p>He began by saying he had a five-point jobs agenda. Lists of proposals are usually problematic for debaters, as they start describing the first few, get into the weeds, and run out of time for the last few. Romney managed to summarize his quintet of proposals in 115 words, less than a minute. It was a remarkably crisp, clear, direct opening argument, one that reached audiences before any started clicking away to other channels.</p> <p>Almost no one expected President Obama would be so listless, meandering, and off his game. I was left seriously wondering if Obama had gotten enough sleep the night before; perhaps the no-applause rule deprived him of the audience reaction that helps fuel his energy and confidence in stump speeches.</p> <p>Periodically President Obama talked about things he wanted to do \u2013 as if he wasn't the incumbent and hadn't had the opportunity to enact his proposals. Early on, he offered an anecdote of a teacher he met in Las Vegas with 42 kids in each class, not enough desks, and outdated textbooks. Many viewers probably wondered why Obama was telling us how bad things are right now, and why he hadn't done something about that school's problems.</p> <p>Shortly after Romney had laid out how tax increases would cost jobs, arguing \"there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes,\" Obama had his worst moment \u2013 turning to moderator Jim Lehrer and effectively surrendering:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Jim, you may want to move on to another topic.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>America, you may want to move on to another president.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heather-hurlburt\">Heather Hurlburt</a>: 'So what would Romney borrow money from China to pay for?'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397201294\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/10/11/1318360150849/heatherhurlburt_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Hurlburt\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Governor Romney turned to Jim Lehrer last night and pledged, \"I will eliminate programs by this test, if they don't pass it: is the program so critical that it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it,\" he seemed to be inviting another one of the moderator's philosophical questions.</p> <p>It hung in the air unasked, instead. In an interdependent global economy, what <em>is</em> worth borrowing money from a competitor and potential adversary for?</p> <p>Perhaps the answer is: anything I, my party, my political philosophy, wants, because money is fungible. Because the US economy is too big to fail. Because borrowing and the debt are part of how giant entities do business, and not as catastrophic as our national dialogue in recent months would suggest.</p> <p>Or perhaps the answer is: anything that will ultimately make our economy and society stronger to compete against and cooperate with China in growing the global economy and maintaining security. That test would offer some interesting moments.</p> <p>Borrowing money to invest in cheap, clean, high-tech energy sources, technology and infrastructure \u2013 which will, in turn, generate jobs and world-beating exports. Seems like a no-brainer.</p> <p>Borrowing money to invest in five-figure tax cuts for that 0.01% of wealthiest \"job-creators\"? Sure, if you believe in trickle-down economics. Certainly not, if you don't.</p> <p>Borrowing money to promote social cohesion? Well, do you believe we need social cohesion to be an effective, competitive society? Thinking about China, perhaps one of the world's cultures that places the highest value on social cohesion \u2013 and whose leaders are terrified at the prospect of social unrest \u2013 is instructive. And what promotes social cohesion? Keeping our promises to veterans by fully funding the veterans administration? Providing healthcare and dignity to seniors, the poor and&#xa0;vulnerable, for the sake of our shared humanity and also our collective public health?</p> <p>Borrowing money from China to increase the exponential edge our military,&#xa0;the world's largest, strongest military, has on the competition?&#xa0;Do you believe our military might is the foundation of all our power? Does it make us more economically competitive? Or do you believe, like the current and past chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff, that it works the other way around?</p> <p>What's more,&#xa0;is it worth borrowing money from China to pay for tanks that can't be used against China, and which the Pentagon doesn't want, anyway? Nuclear weapons that top security thinkers believe are obsolete?</p> <p>Just asking.</p> <p><em>Heather Hurlburt is executive director of the National Security Network</em></p>",
  "<p>Britain's nascent \"green\" business sector has hit trouble with a warning about the future of a pioneering fuel cell developer and of a solar panel factory in Wales.</p> <p>Shares in Ceres Power, which employs 160 staff in Horsham and Crawley in West Sussex, dived 76% after it told the London stock exchange that it may have to wind down or sell off the business.</p> <p>Ceres has been hit by a series of delays on the launch of its combined heat and power (CHP) energy efficient boiler as a result of technical issues with a product designed for homes in Britain and further afield.</p> <p>The company has been in talks with potential lenders but in a statement it said \"despite extensive efforts it has been unsuccessful in securing sufficient funding for the business going forward\".</p> <p>Ceres said at the end of June that it had \u00a310.2m worth of cash but had since admitted it needed to raise more by the end of September. The shares plunged to a 52-week low of 2.05p before recovering a little to 2.6p. Less than a year ago the company was trading above 30p a share.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Wrexham there are mounting worries that Japanese electronics group Sharp could make further cutbacks at, or even close, a solar panel manufacturing site.</p> <p>A spokesman at the Sharp site admitted there was intense speculation locally about what was happening following reports from Tokyo that the company, which had global losses of $4.8bn (\u00a32.9bn) last year, might decide to withdraw from production of photovoltaic modules in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Around 300 temporary jobs were axed last month at the Wrexham facility and local MP Ian Lucas said he was trying to clarify with Sharp what was going on while admitting he was very concerned.</p> <p>Lucas said the Sharp group had its own difficulties but the local solar panel plant was also being hit by the coalition government's decision to make sweeping cuts in the feed-in tariff which provides subsidies to householders to fit panels to their roofs.</p> <p>He added: \"Sharp is a massively important employer in this area and any suggestion of closure would be absolutely dreadful. I am very concerned and angry with the way Greg Barker [the energy minister] has undermined the industry. I have had a good relationship with Sharp and am trying to get information from them but that is never easy even when the news is good.\"</p>",

Residents navigate dugout canoes through a maze of brown waterways that spread far beneath the longest bridge in Africa, which connects the creek-filled islands of Lagos with its crowded mainland.</p> <p>Some see the community balanced on water as an engineering feat that is almost as impressive as the bridge that passes by it, albeit less planned. An estimated 250,000 people live in Makoko; they trade, shop and build aquafarms on the lagoon's waters.</p> <p>\"Like everybody passing over [Lagos city's] Third Mainland Bridge, I became interested in Makoko,\" said Kunle Adeyemi, a Nigerian architect who is based in the waterside city of Amsterdam. While Makoko is largely self-sufficient, the entire community is served by a single primary school. Adeyemi's visit to the area in 2009 gave him the idea of building a floating settlement \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/oct/04/lagos-living-off-the-water-in-video\">starting with a floating school</a> (video).</p> <p>As climate change pushes up sea levels and coastal erosion chips away at the shoreline, thousands of homes built along west Africa's densely populated coast are washed away each year. Each year, the tropical rains that lash Lagos overwhelm the colonial-era drainage system. During rainy seasons, fishermen sometimes canoe across roads sunk under floodwaters.</p> <p>How Africa's largest city reacts to the encroaching waters is a crucial test case for other countries.</p> <p>\"The big question is what will Lagos look like in 50 years' time? Will we have a city that integrates water into its design, or will we have a city that tries to keep water out at any cost?\" said Janthomas Hiemstra, deputy country director for the UN Development Fund, as he stood on a floating platform like the one on which the proposed Makoko school could be built.</p> <p>It a question authorities are grappling with in the main city of a country whose current growth rate could push its population to 300 million within a quarter of a century. \"A floating school like this could be part of a vision for Lagos,\" said Hiemstra.</p> <p>Amid a torrential downpour, children and adults alike leap on to the platform, which is made of locally sourced wood and kept afloat by bright blue recycled plastic barrels. \"We looked at many ways of creating a building that would still be functional regardless of the water levels, and we decided the building should float,\" said Adeyemi, as the platform swayed gently in the waters.</p> <p>Under the plan, 16 such podiums would be lashed together to form the ground floor of the school. The proposed three-storey triangular structure would address some of the infrastructure problems that plague the communities in Lagos that live on the water, said Adeyemi. Solar panels would provide renewable energy; the sloping roof would enable rainwater to be harvested efficiently, and a waste-to-energy system would solve sanitation problems.</p> <p>Adeyemi added: \"The building can be adapted for other uses, such as homes or hospitals. Ultimately, it's a vision that can be used to sustainably develop [African] coastal communities.\"</p> <p>But the government is reluctant to embrace the idea of making permanent the dozen of settlements that crowd the city's waters. Periodic attempts to evict their inhabitants have been unsuccessful.</p> <p>\"The fact remains that [the Makoko] waterbody is the main natural drainage facility for Lagos state. People living there endanger not just themselves but the general citizens of the state,\" said the city's state planning commissioner, Toyin Ayinde. \"We're trying to see how [water communities] can keep some activities on the water, but the idea is for them to live on the land. There's more to our shoreline protection than just putting cities on water.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, the floating school project has received tentative backing from local authorities, and Ayinde admitted that proposals for houses on water could still be part of a wider vision.</p> <p>Not everyone living on the water wants to leave. A Makoko fisherman, Boyo Shemede, said: \"I was born on these waters. If we leave the water, we will still be alive but we will never be truly happy. What we really want is for the government to help us with sanitation.\"</p> <p>In recent years, Lagos has begun exploiting its waters. More than 1 million Lagosians now use some form of water transport each month, and the city's waterfront ministry has welcomed private investment in projects, such as the construction of <a href=\"http://www.ekoatlantic.com/\" title=\"\">Eko Atlantic</a> city, on the southern tip of Lagos. Unlike Makoko, the new district, which is being constructed in the wealthier part of the city, will have modern water, sanitation, transport and security systems.</p> <p>Each day, workers fill a strip of reclaimed land with sand pumped from the ocean floor. Eko Atlantic's developer plan to turn the reclaimed land into a gleaming new city, surrounded by an 8km protective wall against the Atlantic surge. City officials say its tree-lined streets would house 250,000 people, roughly the same number as Makoko. \"It's the first time a project with reclaimed land has been done on this scale. Nobody knows if it will actually work,\" said an official. \"On the other hand, if it works, it shows that Lagos can be a waterfront city and a beautiful city at the same time.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UNDP remains keen on getting plans for the Makoko floating settlement off the ground.</p> <p>\"What's happening at the moment \u2013 and this is a phenomenon not only in Nigeria \u2013 is that a lot of governments are trying to do something about the effects of sea erosion. That is reactive, and that's good,\" said Hiemstra. \"But on the other hand, that money and effort could be better directed if we knew what we were after in the long term, rather than just dousing the fires.</p> <p>\"The future of Lagos has to incorporate [water-based] communities; you cannot just think them away.\"</p>",
  "<p>Syria's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/nato-pentagon-shelling-turkish-village\" title=\"\">lethal shelling of a Turkish town</a>, the latest and most serious of a string of cross-border incidents this year, has put the international community on the spot. How much longer can the US, Nato, the UN security council, the EU and major non-western actors such as Russia and China keep the expanding Syrian crisis at arm's length, variously denouncing and abetting the Assad regime, squabbling between themselves, but doing next to nothing?</p> <p>Predictions that the violence, which has so far taken an estimated 31,000 lives, would spread beyond Syria's borders are now coming true. This trend directly threatens international peace and security, as defined by the UN charter. Yet still the great powers sit on their hands. The fact Turkey has made serious miscalculations, initially underestimating Bashar al-Assad's staying power and the refugee exodus, raises fears that its leaders may make further misjudgments under pressure, leading to military escalation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_90447.htm\" title=\"\">A Nato statement issued after Turkey was attacked on Wednesday</a> acknowledged Syria's internal problems have now become everybody's business. \"The Syrian regime's recent aggressive acts at Nato's south-eastern border \u2026 are a flagrant breach of international law and a clear and present danger to security,\" it said. But Assad might well dismiss such concerns as eyewash. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Nato's secretary general, has made plain the alliance has no intention of replicating last year's Libyan intervention. Nato defence ministers are due to meet in Brussels next week but at present, Syria is not on the agenda.</p> <p>Reactions to the Ak\u00e7akale shelling from the US, Britain and others were similarly strong \u2026 and meaningless. The US state department called the incident \"depraved\" while Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, said it was \"outrageous\". But neither mentioned practical measures.</p> <p>Neither the US nor Britain has shown any appetite, for example, for creating safe havens along the Syria-Turkey border or the sort of no-fly zones imposed in Iraq in the 1990s, as backed by France and Turkey. And as the UN security council prepared to meet today, Russia, predictably obstructive, said it would not support a statement condemning the Assad regime because, in its view, Ak\u00e7akale was an \"accident\".</p> <p>On past form, Turkey's efforts to rally international support will have limited effect. Any help may be focused on Turkish self-defence, rather than on addressing the broader Syrian crisis. <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/columnist-294166-nations-run out-of-ideas-on-syria-as-fsa-runs-out-of-ammunition.html\" title=\"\">Writing in Today's Zaman</a>, columnist Lale Kemal, noted:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Neither Turkish-US bilateral cooperation nor multilateral meetings taking place among various countries on ending the bloodshed in Syria \u2026 have produced any recipe to address the problem \u2026 As the fighting takes place near the Turkish border, nations are running out of ideas over what to do with Syria and the FSA [Free Syrian Army rebels] is running out of ammunition.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Turkey recently hosted a summit of intelligence chiefs from France, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the US, in the form of CIA director David Petraeus, Kemal said.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The summit reflected an attempt by Turkey not to be left alone in dealing with the Syrian crisis [and] improve intelligence sharing \u2026 and how to coordinate to improve the FSA's ability to fight \u2026 However, the summit did not yield any results.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>This was partly because the US did not want to arm the FSA, for fear weapons might fall into the hands of al-Qaida, while Turkey worried the same thing might happen with Kurdish separatist fighters.</p> <p>All the same, the do-nothing, hand-wringing favoured by Turkey's international allies may not be politically sustainable much longer as the Syrian crisis inexorably expands not just into Turkey but into Iraq, Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, too. Turkey will not go it alone, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/turkey-syria-threat-security-live#block-506d7823c0e3aacd18e2f6a9\" title=\"\">a parliamentary motion authorising cross-border operations</a>. But pressure for more direct, multilateral intervention, most probably via Nato, is growing among Arab states and in the US, where Barack Obama's hands-off stance is under fire from Republicans.</p> <p>Alon Ben-Meir of New York University's Center for Global Affairs argued in a recent Turkish press interview that direct action was becoming both unavoidable and desirable, and that the best way forward was a no-fly zone. <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/news-294214-syria-no-fly-zone-should-be-imposed-as-soon-as-possible.html\" title=\"\">He said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Now that Turkey is asking for this, if Nato goes along with it and the United States goes along with it, that's a change in attitude. Turkey did not have the legal legitimacy to intervene. But now they also realise that everybody is intervening.<br>\"Iran is intervening by sending military advisors. Russia is intervening by sending weapons on a regular basis. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are intervening by sending money and some weapons. And the United States is intervening by sending communications gear and some weapons and money indirectly. So everyone is interfering, but they talk about no interference, which is cynical \u2026\"<br>\"The Assad regime is finished. When it might happen depends on what other powers do and when they do it. If after the [US presidential] election the United States along with Turkey, in particular these two countries, decide that the time has come, then they will be able to accelerate his demise.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Now that creating triple-A games requires similar levels of investment to making movies, we should all be grateful Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network offer an outlet for maverick developers with big ideas but little resources.</p> <p>And developers don't come more maverick than Arkedo, a bunch of wacky Frenchmen whose Paris studio, so they say, includes a pop-up restaurant. Arkedo's latest opus, Hell Yeah!

Ash is equipped with a jet-pack which is also a drill, as well as an arsenal of over-the-top machine-guns, rockets, lasers which steadily grows as the game progresses. It's very much a side-scroller, and you open up otherwise inaccessible areas by disposing of prescribed numbers of monsters. Each world, naturally, ends with a boss-battle.</p> <p>Proceedings are never allowed to become repetitive and clever touches constantly abound. When you reduce a monster's health to zero, you're treated to a finishing-move mini-game reminiscent of WarioWare Inc, and as long as you time your button-presses (or correctly answer a parody of a questionnaire), you're rewarded with a death straight out of Itchy &amp; Scratchy \u2013 involving a swarm of stinging bees, perhaps, or an angry tyrannosaurus rex hatching from a giant egg.</p> <p>The monsters are great, too \u2013 one minute, you'll be taking on a giant dancing Bearbrick-style panda with laser-shooting eyes, and the next what appears to be a turd with a chainsaw sticking out of the top of his head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397177253\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Columnists/Columnists/2012/10/4/1349353317309/Hell-Yeah-Wrath-of-the-De-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hell Yeah!

  "<p>It was supposed to be the moment the Chinese box office raised its head above the parapet and began its climb towards replacing the US as the world's largest cinemagoing audience.

Analysts reasoned that Johnson's tale of time-travelling hitmen, which stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt, had been boosted by its status as a US-Chinese co-production and several scenes and characters based in the far east. In order to placate Chinese partners, large sequences were relocated from the US to China \u2013 which, 60 years in the future, has become the world's greatest superpower \u2013 and Chinese actor Qing Xu was added to the cast as Willis's wife.</p> <p>In fact, officials who reported the Chinese box office simply mixed up yuan and dollars at several sites. The true Chinese box office may have been as low as $5-7m, Deadline reports, and the film may not even have opened at No 1 in the country.</p> <p>Such a dramatic turnaround, at the very least, highlights the fledgling nature of box-office reporting in China in comparison with the US, where grosses have been a part of the Hollywood conversation ever since films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36305/jaws\" title=\"\">Jaws</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36316/star.wars\" title=\"\">Star Wars</a> ushered in the blockbuster era in the mid-1970s. The delay in correcting the erroneous data is thought to be due to a Chinese national holiday.</p> <p>China's box office is increasing exponentially as the country builds thousands of new multiplexes each year to meet demand, and Hollywood fare often performs spectacularly due to lack of competition \u2013 only 20 or so non-Chinese films are allowed to screen there annually. The country recently overtook Japan as the second-largest cinemagoing audience, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/09/james-cameron-3d-china\" title=\"\">Hollywood film-makers such as James Cameron</a> have been scrambling to set up Chinese bases.

  "<p>One of the world's foremost climate scientists has warned that vulnerable island states may need to consider evacuating their populations within a decade due to a much faster than anticipated melting of the world's ice sheets.</p> <p>Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at <a href=\"http://www.psu.edu/\" title=\"\">Pennsylvania State University</a>, said the latest evidence shows that models have underestimated the speed at which the Greenland and west Antarctic ice sheets will start to shrink.</p> <p>Mann, who was part of the IPCC team awarded the Nobel peace prize in 2007, said it had been expected that island nations would have several decades to adapt to rising sea levels, but that evacuation may now be their only option.</p> <p>His warning comes just weeks after the <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/\" title=\"\">National Snow and Ice Data Centre</a> in Boulder, Colorado disclosed that sea ice in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/arctic\" title=\"\">Arctic</a> shrank a dramatic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">18% this year</a> on the previous record set in 2007 to a record low of 3.41m sq km.</p> <p>\"We know Arctic sea ice is declining faster than the models predict,\" Mann told the Guardian at the <a href=\"http://sxsweco.com/\" title=\"\">SXSW Eco conference</a> in Austin, Texas. \"When you look at the major Greenland and the west Antarctic ice sheets, which are critical from the standpoint of sea level rise, once they begin to melt we really start to see sea level rises accelerate.</p> <p>\"The models have typically predicted that will not happen for decades but the measurements that are coming in tell us it is already happening so once again we are decades ahead of schedule.</p> <p>\"Island nations that have considered the possibility of evacuation at some point, like Tuvalu, may have to be contending those sort of decisions within the matter of a decade or so.\"</p> <p>Mann says the Pacific islands, which are only 4.6 metres above sea level at their highest point, are facing the imminent prospect of flooding, with salt water intrusion destroying fresh water supplies and increased erosion.</p> <p>Suggesting evacuations would accelerate a change in public consciousness around the issue of climate change, he said: \"Thousands of years of culture is at risk of disappearing as the populations of vulnerable island states have no place to go.</p> <p>\"For these people, current sea levels are already representative of dangerous anthropogenic interference because they will lose their world far before the rest of us suffer.</p> <p>\"I think it is an example, one of a number, where the impacts are playing out in real time. It is not an abstract prediction about the future or about far off exotic creatures like polar bears. We are talking about people potentially having to evacuate from places like Tvulu or the Arctic's Kivalina, another low lying island which is already feeling the detrimental impacts of sea level rise.\"</p> <p>Mann, who is one of the primary targets for attacks by \"climate deniers,\" said that there is still uncertainty about the speed of global warming as it is not clear what the impact of feedback mechanisms could be. In particular, he pointed to the release of methane that will come as the permafrost in the arctic melts.</p> <p>\"We know there is methane trapped and as it escapes into the atmosphere it accelerates the warming even further,\" he said. \"But we don't know quite how much of it there is, but there is definitely the potential to lead to even greater warming than the models predict.\"</p> <p>Mann said it was not only island states that were feeling the impacts of climate change and warned that the terrible drought and wildfires suffered by the US this year were just the precursor of far worse to come.</p> <p>\"If you look at the US, some of these things are unfolding ahead of schedule and we are already contending with climate change impacts that were once theoretical,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We predicted decades ago that this might eventually happen. We are watching them unfold and there are very real consequences to our economy and to our environment.</p> <p>\"The climate models tell us that what today are record breaking levels of heat will become a typical summer in a matter of 20-30 years if we carry on with business as usual. Not only will this become the new normal but we will have to change the scale because we will see heat and drought far worse than anything we have seen before.\"</p> <p>The silver lining in all the bad news is that while the political system is gridlocked when it comes to confronting climate change, public attitudes are starting to change.</p> <p>\"It is going to take a little while to sink in,\" says Mann \"but there is evidence of a dramatic shift in awareness and the public increasingly recognises climate change is real and if the public becomes convinced of this, they will demand action and they are connecting the dots because we are seeing climate change playing out in a very visible way.</p> <p>\"I think we are close to a potential tipping point in public consciousness and what will tip it, you never quite know, but another summer like the one we just witnessed we will see a dramatic shift in public pressure to do something about this problem.\"</p> <p>One reason that attitudes are changing slowly, according to Mann, is that scientists are tending to be conservative in their forecasts out of fear that they will be attacked for overstating evidence.</p> <p>He said the tactics of those who question climate change was not only to intimidate scientists already in the public arena, but also to warn off others from taking part in the public discourse.</p> <p>But Mann believes the power of the Koch brothers and others in the fossil fuel lobby, whom he believes have been responsible for poisoning the whole climate change debate, is on the wane.</p> <p>\"I am optimistic,\" he says. \"The forces of denial will not go down with a whimper and as the rhetoric becomes more heated and the attacks become more concerted, we see the last vestiges of a movement that is dying. The effort to deny the problem exists will have set us back decades but it is still possible to avoid breaching 450 parts of per million of CO2 if concerted action is taken.\"</p> <p>While he is severely critical of those private business that are seeking to deny climate change exists, he said there were other businesses who were starting to wake up to the need to change behaviour.</p> <p>\"I personally don't believe captains of business are villains and who don't care about the legacy of the world, even though there are a few bad apples,\" he says. \"Just look at the reinsurance industry where they face devastating losses if climate change moves.</p> <p>\"There are an increasing number of companies like Walmart which are ideologically conservative but have a real commitment to sustainability as they realise that as people become more concerned, they will reward companies that are part of the solution.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>This is ostensibly a story about cycling in London but the message is relevant to all, so bear with me. The lesson is this: for all the talk of a cycling boom in the UK, cyclists largely remain a marginalised, fringe group who regularly face unchallenged slurs, falsehoods and generalisations. </p> <p>It all began in May when London's mayor, Boris Johnson, one of the more famous cyclists in the country, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/may/25/cycling-governed-dimwits\">produced the startling statistic that in 62% of accidents in the capital</a> where a cyclist was killed or serious injured this was found to be down to the rider breaking the law. It was questioned by cycling groups and it turned out Johnson was repeating some hearsay he'd been told at a public meeting.</p> <p>That was alarming enough, but Johnson is infamously light on detail and lazy at mastering briefs, so it wasn't perhaps the greatest surprise. To me, what followed was even worse.</p> <p>I (and many others) asked the mayor's office when they planned to rescind the clearly false statistic. Again and again I got the same reply: <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/\">Transport for London</a>, the quango which runs transport policy for the mayor, was \"looking into\" the statistic. Eventually I gave up.</p> <p>Luckily, <a href=\"http://www.greenparty.org.uk/people/jenny-jones.html\">Green London Assembly member Jenny Jones</a> is made of sterner stuff, and she submitted a written question which, last last month, <a href=\"http://lcc.org.uk/articles/boris-johnson-retracts-claim-that-two-thirds-of-cyclists-killed-and-injured-broke-the-law\">finally got a reply</a>. Here's Johnson's statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I asked Transport for London to look into a statistic that I was told about during my election campaign. Its own statistics and research suggest this is not the case in London and I am pleased to be able to set the record straight on this.</p> </blockquote> <p>No apology, you'll note. Also, crucially, no mention of how wrong Johnson was. I asked TfL what their answer was. Astonishingly, <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/pedal-cyclist-collisions-and-casualities-in-greater-london-sep-2011.pdf\">their figures show</a> that in accidents were a cyclist was killed or badly hurt the cyclist was presumed to have committed an offence in just 6% of cases. The vehicle driver was assumed to have done so 56% of the time while 39% of the time it wasn't clear. This information was passed to Johnson before the Olympics, TfL said.</p> <p>What can we learn from this? Firstly, that Johnson was very, very wrong. Far from cyclists being to blame almost two-thirds of the time, they're actually almost a tenth as likely as drivers to have committed an offence. Secondly \u2013 and I'd say this is more significant \u2013 Johnson sees cyclists as so unimportant that he can not just trot out an obvious falsehood about cyclists but not bother to correct it for four months, even when his slur was proven.</p> <p>There's a lot of talk in the US about \"post-truth\" politics, where people like Republican vice presidential candidate <a href=\"http://news.runnersworld.com/2012/08/31/paul-ryan-says-hes-run-sub-300-marathon/\">Paul Ryan can tell demonstrable lies</a> without apparent damage to his reputation. Johnson is perhaps our most brazen, American-style politician, so again maybe it's not so shocking to see him doing the same. But the question is: would he have dared do the same to another group?</p> <p>Last month's issue of magazine The Psychologist <a href=\"http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_25-editionID_217-ArticleID_2136-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist%5C0912walk.pdf\">carries a fascinating interview with Dr Ian Walker</a>, the man who famously <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/5334208.stm\">showed that drivers tend to give less room when overtaking to cyclists wearing helmets</a> (and gamely donned a blonde wig to see whether women get more space than me: apparently so). He describes how cyclists are treated as a classic societal \"outgroup\", meaning they suffer from \"overgeneralisation of negative behaviour and attributes\", for example, \"You all jump red lights\".</p> <p>Walker remains puzzled:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However, there has to be more to it than just this. For a long time I wondered if the outgroup status of cyclists was compounded by two other known social psychological factors: norms and majority vs minority groups. Not only are cyclists an outgroup, they're also a minority outgroup. Moreover, they are engaging in an activity that is deemed slightly inappropriate in a culture that views driving as normative and desirable and, arguably, views cycling as anti-conventional and possibly even infantile. </p> <p>But even adding these factors into the mix does not explain all the anger that cyclists experience. It's easy to identify other minority outgroups whose behaviour similarly challenges social norms but who do not get verbally and physically attacked like cyclists do: vegetarians, for example. So there's clearly one or more important variables that we've not identified yet. Any social psychologists looking for a challenge are very welcome to wade into this.</p> </blockquote> <p>I thought of Walker's words as a listened to a discussion last week on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wr3p\">Jeremy Vine's Radio 2 programme</a>. His type of show, where everyone is obliged to have a \"view\", ideally less than nuanced, might not be everyone's cup of tea but it's by no means the worst example of the sort.</p> <p>This segment was discussing cycling, and one of the guests was a journalist-turned comedy writer called Jan Etherington, who had written a particularly absurd cycling-baiting column for that day's Daily Telegraph. You can <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9562836/Wed-just-grown-to-love-cyclists-and-then-Andrew-Mitchell-had-to-come-along.html\">read it here</a>, if you have the strength. Suffice to say it was a half-baked \"humorous\" piece about how <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-police-log\">Andrew Mitchell being short tempered on a bike</a> had ruined her Olympic-tinged love of cyclists, and she now saw us all as, yes, Lycra louts. Such nonsense was repeated more or less verbatim on Vine's show.</p> <p>I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99/status/250945024957759488\">tweeted my views</a> on the exchange, and to my surprise <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/250984282632355840\">got a reply</a> from Vine. His argument, in a pair of 140-character missives, stressed that he was a cyclist and seemed to say Etherington was simply being given enough rope to hang her own argument.</p> <p>Vine said she complained that cyclists \"are using the road\" where she lives and \"wearing terrible outfits.\"</p> <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-in-reply-to=\"250948773596000256\"> <p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterwalker99\">peterwalker99</a> ...and \"wearing terrible outfits.\" Better for her to say it than for me to stop her.</p> <p>\u2014 Jeremy Vine (@theJeremyVine) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theJeremyVine/status/250984282632355840\" data-datetime=\"2012-09-26T15:44:50+00:00\">September 26, 2012</a></p> </blockquote> <p>I wasn't convinced. I can almost live with the slurs, it's the lazy generalisations about cyclists that get me. Walker's comparisons with vegetarians is quite apt: both groups are hugely heterogenous collections of people with just one, slightly arbitrary, thing in common. When Harriet Harman was <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/anger-as-harriet-harman-escapes-driving-ban-for-mobile-phone-crash-6735983.html\">caught talking on her a mobile phone in a car</a> \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/DrivingIssues/1059144296.html\">practice which most likely</a> costs more lives in a year than bad cycling would in a decade \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1217974/Im-Harriet-Harman--know--What-Minister-allegedly-told-witness-crashing-parked-car.html\">before telling police</a>, \"'I'm Harriet Harman - you know where you can get hold of me,\" there was a notable lack of Radio 2 discussions about how this showed \"drivers\" to be reckless and pompous.</p> <p>But when it comes to lazy generalisations, not to mention outright falsehoods, cyclists remain fair game. I find it very depressing.</p>",
  "<p>Last Saturday I spoke at the Harvard Women in Business Conference, an annual event that I love. I wore a bright blue dress in a sea of sober black suits and talked to them about the importance of being authentic in order to be happy. These young women, many of them ready to sentence themselves to a life of corporate status climbing, cried when I told them that only through being authentic could they be happy. It was one of the most poignant talks of my career.</p> <p>Later, during a discussion on Going Global, a young woman asked, \"For the Americans on the panel, how do you deal with being a person of privilege while working in global development?\" My eyes lit up with fury as she directed her question specifically at the white Americans on the panel. I let them answer, then smiled and added with a wink: \"I am an American, you know, and also a person of privilege.\" She instantly understood what I meant.</p> <p>Her question assumed that those of us in developing nations are to be pitied. I know as a Senegalese that her attitude is precisely what disgusts us about many who work at NGOs. Every year we see thousands of \"privileged\" young Americans and Europeans eager to come \"help the underprivileged\". Don't they understand how contemptuous that is?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c-jSQD5FVxE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c-jSQD5FVxE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The actor Djimon Hounsou performed a powerful rendition of Binyavanga Wainaina's piece <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-jSQD5FVxE\" title=\"\">How Not to Write About Africa</a>. In the most compelling passage he describes how African wildlife is portrayed with dignity. We have all seen the majesty of giraffes, lions, zebras and elephants parading across the screen. But African people are either portrayed as corrupt, evil or pathetic. The blog <a href=\"http://aidthoughts.org/\" title=\"\">Aid Thoughts</a> created the category \"poverty porn\" after reading <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/magatte-wade/does-jeffrey-sachs-believ_b_217785.html\" title=\"\">my article on Jeffrey Sachs's Millennium Village project</a>. For many of those who \"care\" about Africans, we are objects through which they express their own \"caring\". This \"caring\" is just as objectifying as old-fashioned racism.</p> <p>At the conference I replied to the young woman, \"If you see us as human beings, there is nothing to deal with. We like to eat good food, we love to talk and laugh with our family and friends. We wonder about the world, and why so often bad is rewarded rather than good.\" To give this particular young woman credit, she thanked me at the end and really internalised my perspective. She felt relieved by my message.</p> <p>But why is it so difficult for people to see others as people? Why are so many NGOs filled with young people who are incapable of relating to us as human beings?</p> <p>I prefer the humanity of a tough business person in a negotiation in which he or she is trying to make a deal. While there are jerks out there, I want to be engaged in relationships with people who believe that I'm worth struggling with, not just pitying. If you approach me with a worldview in which you are privileged and I need your help, there is no possibility of an authentic relationship. You may as well see yourself as the master and me as the slave.</p> <p>I know that there are countless people in the NGO world that have done a great deal of good. But I would like to propose that NGOs either refuse to hire, or simply fire, anyone who has a condescending attitude towards the poor. We need to certify a new class of NGO: \"No pity shit\" NGOs. Moreover, the problem goes well beyond these organisations. Many from the developed world \u2013 in government, multilateral agencies, business, and academia \u2013 have a similar attitude. I don't understand why it is so hard for some humans to see other humans as also human. Your perception of \"privilege\" is your problem.

  "<p>How many children are abducted in England and Wales? The possible abduction of April Jones has pushed the issue onto the front pages, but how common is it?</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-265883\">latest crime figures</a>, published by the Office for National Statistics, show 532 cases of child abduction reported to police in 2011/12. The figures do not include Scotland, which has a separate justice system.</p> <p>That figure is down 3% on the previous year and much lower than the high of 1,035 cases in 2004/05.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://dev.datawrapper.de/chart/HFtLl\"> <iframe src=\"http://dev.datawrapper.de/chart/HFtLl\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width=\"460\" height=\"500\"></iframe> </figure>  <p></p> <p>But, as overall crime is going down too, what do those figures mean?

If you exclude sexual offences, it shows that child abductions were 8% of those offences, so, small compared to child cruelty or neglect, which accounted for 6,081 crimes.

Of those, 62% were about serious and life-threatening hazards. Shelter says there were 487 successful prosecutions against private landlords last year, an increase of 77%, mostly driven by a small handful of local councils.

He writes: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Along with the pressures of rising rents and letting agent fees comes the dark underbelly of private renting: rogue landlords. This unscrupulous minority are flourishing as competition for rented homes leaves people on modest incomes with no choice but to rent from them.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Shelter research has shown that local authorities are most likely to take 'soft' action in response to these complaints, such as writing a letter or making a phone-call. While this allows them to tick a box saying action has been taken, it does very little to deter the minority of landlords who are serially exploiting tenants.<br>Some councils are taking a tougher line. We are tracking successful prosecutions and there is evidence of a surge in some areas \u2013 such as Manchester, Leeds, Salford and Newham.

The <a href=\"http://youtu.be/9ThzPDmlYgk\" title=\"Danny Lee-Frost talks about the raid (video)\">investigators were not after crack cocaine but illicit supplies of Modafinil</a>, a pill taken by students to help them stay up all night writing their essays.</p> <p>The team from the <a href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/#page=DynamicListMedicines\" title=\"\">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</a> (MHRA), accompanied by the Guardian, was mounting the raid as part of a global effort called Operation Pangea, involving 101 different countries.</p> <p>Pangea has seized \u00a36.5m of drugs globally, and more than 18,000 websites have been closed down or had payment facilties removed, while the MHRA has netted more than 2.3m doses of unlicensed medicine worth more than \u00a33.8m, including 68,000 counterfeit pills. The sequence of British raids was each named after a British prime minister, from Eden through to Blair \u2013 with the north-west London raid given the moniker Operation Home.</p> <p>This is the fifth year of a co-ordinated action against websites selling illegal and sometimes fake medicines. Most of the haul is Viagra and assorted versions of it; a raid the day before had turned up 13,000 packets, labelled as a Chinese herbal remedy.</p> <p>The investigators, led by Danny Lee-Frost, head of operations at the MHRA, had evidence, they said, that the less well-known Modafinil was being sold in the UK through a website registered to a man living at that address. Although the website was registered in Hong Kong and claimed to be perfectly legal because it was outside British jurisdiction, a packet of pills bought as a test purchase by Lee-Frost's team was postmarked from north-west London. In the UK, Modafinil \u2013 also known as Provigil, Modalert and by other names too \u2013 can only be sold by a licensed pharmacist, to somebody with a doctor's prescription treating narcolepsy(a medical disorder involving the inability to stay awake) .</p> <p>\"The [operation] is to get the message out [to the public] that the internet is not a safe place to buy medicines,\" said Lee-Frost, whose idea Pangea was. Modafinil, he said, \"is a pretty powerful drug. It should only be prescribed by a doctor. It is not to be lightly used.\" The people running the websites \"are not interested in health. They are only interested in making money.\"</p> <p>The MHRA collaborates with a number of organisations to target illegal websites, from the Metropolitan police e-crimes unit to US homeland security and specialised organisations that identify suspect online activity.</p> <p>This raid was not at the crack of dawn, but at a less hostile 7.30am and there was no question of breaking down the door, although the MHRA officers are permitted to do that if it is proportionate to the offence. The two police officers, said Lee-Frost, were there \"to prevent any breach of the peace\" and \"to deal with the question of who we are\".</p> <p>Strict rules around the MHRA's powers of investigation mean there had been limited surveillance of the target. \"We're allowed one drive-by at the time we intend to go in, to see if the lights are on and there are kids' toys on the lawn \u2013 that sort of thing,\" said Lee-Frost.</p> <p>The house has been converted to more than a dozen flats, with no certainty any of the lit windows belonged to the target \u2013 just a lot of curtain-twitching from houses opposite. With no response to ringing the suspect's doorbell, the team tried all the rest in turn, until a young man in pyjamas was persuaded to come and open the front door. \"Golly,\" he said.</p> <p>Not long after the officers made their way up the stairs, Lee-Frost, on the pavement outside, got a call on his mobile. He looked glum. \"It's a one-room bedsit,\" he said. \"He claims he has closed down the website and it all comes from China. He rents a mailbox in the City and says that's where his laptop is.\" There were no pills and just a small amount of paperwork. They would try to persuade the suspect to hand over his laptop, but this raid was unlikely to lead to a spectacular court case, although they do happen. In April, the MHRA got a confiscation order in Southwark crown court for \u00a314.4m against a fake medicines dealer after tracking down his assets across Europe, which a judge decided were all the proceeds of crime.</p> <p>ModafinilUK, the website registered to the man in north-west London, was closed down on the day of the raid, just one of nearly 9,000 illegal pharmacy websites shut down. Like twigs on the branches of a tree, their URL addresses lead to a few \"anchor sites\" run, said the MHRA's head of enforcement, Nimo Ahmed, by organised crime networks, often based in Russia.</p> <p>The two biggest are well known \u2013 Eva Pharmacy, which makes around \u00a31.4m a month and GlavMed, making \u00a3620,000. Investigators spent several years targeting these organisations but, said Ahmed, it proved impossible to pin down evidence as to where and when crimes had taken place, with websites in Russia, medicines supplied from India and offshore bank accounts in which to store the proceeds. The Russian medicines authority went in and managed to rattle GlavMed, however. \"The individual who was supposed to be behind the website left the country a couple of weeks before the raids took place,\" said Ahmed.</p> <p>Unable to stamp out the anchor sites, the MHRA and collaborators still manage to choke off a lot of their trade, closing down linked sites, confiscating and testing suspect packages entering the country and working with Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and other payment organisations to stop the money getting through.</p>",
  "<p>Imports of ash trees could be banned to save the UK's estimated 80m of the species from a deadly fungus.</p> <p>The tree disease <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> has already decimated around 90% of Denmark's ash population and was found in the UK at a Buckinghamshire nursery in February, raising fears of a repeat of the epidemic of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s, which wiped out virtually the entire mature population of elm trees \u2013 25m \u2013 by the 1990s.</p> <p>Infected trees have since been found at a handful of locations in the UK from outside Glasgow to Cambridgeshire \u2013 though not in wild areas outside recent plantings and nurseries \u2013 and are being destroyed as they are found. Ash accounts for around a third of our wooded landscape which includes parks and hedgerows, as well as woods and forests.</p> <p>A ban on imports could come into effect as early as November, just before the planting season, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said on Thursday, <a href=\"http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/consultations/index.cfm\" title=\"\">launching a consultation that ends on 26 October</a>.</p> <p>The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, said: \"This disease could have a devastating impact on our native ash trees so we need to take action to stop it. We are working towards a ban on imports, and looking to impose movement restrictions on trees from infected areas.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"By taking decisive action we can prevent our ash trees from suffering the same fate as elm trees did in the 1970s.\"</p> <p>Conservationists welcomed the move towards a ban on imports, saying it was \"not a minute too soon\". Norman Starks, UK operations director at the <a href=\"http://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Woodland Trust</a>, said: \"The Trust will no longer plant imported ash trees on our estate and is reducing the number of ash to be planted this season by 100,000 trees. We are committed to working with the industry to do everything possible to prevent the further spread of ash dieback and protect one of the nation's most common native trees.\"</p> <p>Dr John Morgan, head of the Forestry Commission's Plant Health Service, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2012/sep/26/fungus-kill-third-britains-trees\" title=\"\">told the Guardian last month</a> that the \"only reliable control is banning imports.\" In August, the trade body for the gardening industry, the Horticultural Trades Association, <a href=\"http://www.the-hta.org.uk/page.php?pageid=977\" title=\"\">called on its members to undertake a voluntary ban on ash imports</a>.</p> <p>The disease, which is widespread on the continent, causes leaf loss and dieback of the tree's crown, and can kill ash trees. The Buckinghamshire nursery where the disease was first found in the UK had imported 2,000 ash trees from the Netherlands and sent them on to 90 different customers around the country. Around 5m ash trees have been imported to the UK since 2003.</p> <p>Members of the public are being encouraged to report suspected cases to the Forestry Commission.</p>",
  "<p>When Lady Gaga launched her <a href=\"http://bornthiswayfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Born This Way Foundation</a> at the Harvard Graduate School of Education earlier this year, she lent major star-power to a growing movement to stem the tide of bullying and violence in schools.</p> <p>In the US, the movement's impetus follows in the wake of a string of suicides by bullied LGBT youth as well as a history of devastating school shootings perpetrated by students felt to be social outcasts.</p> <p>The popstar, who describes herself as \"mother monster\" to millions of fans worldwide, is speaking out about the importance of youth working to build safe spaces, and recognising that schools are powerful places to spark societal change, she hopes her message will \"inject love, acceptance and tolerance into culture.\" At the end of the day, the goal is not only to \"save the victim,\" she says, \"but also save the bully.\"</p> <p>How can we save both the victims and the bullies? It is a question on many minds as educators grapple with developing measures to combat school violence. At the heart of this challenge is recognising that all young people need to learn to develop healthy relationships and ways of expressing themselves.</p> <p>Whether we think about violence as a danger in the learning environment or as a wider threat faced by young people, schools are powerful places to reach and teach young people the importance of empathy. Sports and arts programmes have long been touted as important educational opportunities for helping students build fundamental life skills, such as self-esteem, teamwork and managing emotions. What might happen if sports and art were combined into a targeted pro-empathy, anti-violence curriculum?</p> <p>School administrators and celebrity advocates alike may want to take a note from the playbook of one budding young social entrepreneur who has done just this \u2013 by leveraging the power of dance to bring empathy training into classrooms around the world, with a focus on the most at-risk communities.</p> <p>Sara Potler is the founder of a social enterprise called <a href=\"http://www.dance4peace.org/index.php\" title=\"\">Dance 4 Peace</a>. Her work, which began while a Fulbright scholar in Bogota, Colombia, has grown into peace education programmes in 15 cities across four continents. Their business model generates revenue through low-cost fees, enabling them to scale up their reach.</p> <p>\"In Bogota, where our organisation began, the students we worked with were exposed to violence related to drug trafficking in the streets, and sometimes even in their homes,\" says Potler. \"Until Dance 4 Peace, the peace-building programs in their schools didn't quite meet students where they were.</p> <p>\"It wasn't until the reggaeton music came on the boombox that they recognised this was something different \u2013 something they could relate to \u2013 and began to open up to tell stories through their bodies.\"</p> <p>The catharsis of music and movement gets at the heart of what makes these young people tick. Potler and her colleagues carefully mould the curriculum by location and context in order to help students build the social and emotional skills they need to understand and transform conflict in their lives.</p> <p>Dance 4 Peace, which has programmes in Latin America and the Philippines, has also experienced success with urban schools in US and European cities, including New York, Washington DC and Leipzig, Germany.</p> <p>Whether in schools in the developing world or in low-income urban areas, Potler's staff have clearly seen the complexity of the challenges facing young people in different places and the human desire to overcome. \"Our goal,\" says Potler, \"is to instill the core competencies students need to succeed in the classroom and eventually the work place, so they can become the leaders and peacemakers their communities need.\"</p> <p>Potler says the organisation recorded a decrease in negative behaviours in a single semester. In one New York school they saw a drop in suspensions from 53 to 16 incidents.</p> <p>An appreciation for dance continues to grow in popular culture thanks in part to the television show <a href=\"http://www.fox.com/dance/videos/34619059/lauren-will-top-8-perform?bctag=extras\" title=\"\">So You Think You Can Dance</a>, an international hit developed by British producer Nigel Lythgoe. The series celebrates young dancers from all walks of life, from poppers and lockers raised on the streets, to ballerinas trained in the studio.</p> <p>Can dance be a catalyst for at-risk youth?

He cites <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/Campus_Resources/eNewsroom/topstories_1771.asp\">a study by Robert McChesney and John Nichols</a> in which they estimated that the ratio of American PR professionals to journalists grew from 1.2-1 in 1980 to 4-1 in 2010.</p> <p>According to Edgecliffe-Johnson, \"top PR firms now see themselves in the same tier of corporate advisers as investment banks or management consultancies.\"</p> <p>And there is another similarity between the British and US experience when it comes to the ubiquity of PR output. Journalists are deluged with press releases that often amount to \"oven-ready copy.\"</p> <p>Consider, for example, <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/\">PR Newswire </a>, which is owned by United Business Media. Edgecliffe-Johnson writes: \"It has started to rethink press releases as multimedia content that \u2013 partly because many news businesses are struggling \u2013 can feed hungry blogs, news outlets and social media sites...</p> <p>\"Guided by editors, clients are now using text, video, audio, infographics and dedicated web pages \u2013 some featuring 'buy now' buttons \u2013 to reach consumers more directly, without a media filter\u2026\"</p> <p>A media filter? That's us journalists, of course, people with the requisite scepticism about PR blurbs and supposed knowledge of the topic to provide readers/consumers with an analysis that will allow them to make an informed decision/choice. </p> <p>If the current trends continue, we will end up without the essential \"media filter\" that, despite its own penchant for spin and misinformation, acts at its best on behalf of a public deluged with self-interested public relations material.</p> <p>And much of that emanates from governments. Davies's book records that the UK government had 1,500 press officers, issued 20,000 press releases a year, and spent millions on PR firms. The foreign office alone spends \u00a3600m a year on \"public diplomacy\". </p> <p>In the States, in 1978, the CIA spent $265m (\u00a3165m) on \"information operations\". What we're talking about here, as we chart the rise of PR and the simultaneous decline of journalism, is an assault on democracy.</p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4ce3ec34-0d3b-11e2-99a1-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28JuMQsUd\">FT</a></p>",
  "<p>The European Union's energy chief has called the bloc's nuclear power stations \"satisfactory\" despite a report on Thursday that showed hundreds of defects, with dozens of reactors failing to meet international safety standards.</p> <p><a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/safety/stress_tests_en.htm\">The report</a> \u2013 the \"stress test\" of Europe's 145 nuclear reactors \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/15/european-union-stress-test-nuclear\" title=\"\">was commissioned after the Fukushima incident in Japan last year</a>. It found that bringing Europe's nuclear power stations up to international standards could cost \u20ac25bn. </p> <p>Some MEPs criticised the commission for not urging stronger action on the nuclear industry.</p> <p>Almost all of the EU's nuclear plants need some form of upgrade or repair, ranging from minor updates to substantial overhauls, but none requiring closure, according to the tests. One issue found in some plants was insufficient preparation for what could happen if the cooling systems were compromised, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-nuclear-meltdown-fukushima-reactor\" title=\"\">as happened in Fukushima</a>. This is potentially serious as it could lead to meltdown.</p> <p>Some of the plants do not have sufficient safety measures in place to cope securely with a serious natural disaster, the tests found. But some other changes needed can be carried out relatively easily.</p> <p>Guenther Oettinger, the energy commissioner, said: \"Our stress test was strict, serious and transparent. It reveals bluntly and objectively what we are good at and where there is a need to improve. Generally the situation is satisfactory but there is no room for complacency. We must work together to ensure that the highest safety standards are in force in every single nuclear power plant in Europe, for the safety of our citizens.\"</p> <p>Some of the defects involve basic safety and monitoring measures, such as the lack of seismic monitors at reactor sites in several countries including France and the Czech Republic.</p> <p>Oettinger said the stress test was an opportunity to ensure the comprehensive enforcement of international safety standards across member states.</p> <p>He said: \"Now we know whether the highest international standards are used for very essential safety features, for example how the risk of an earthquake is measured.\"</p> <p>The stress tests, which included international experts carrying out spot tests of plants, took place in co-operation with the <a href=\"http://www.ensreg.eu/\" title=\"\">European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group</a>, made of member states' national safety authorities.</p> <p>Oettinger said: \"We have assessed the safety and robustness of nuclear power plants in case of extreme natural events. This means especially flood and earthquakes. Both scenarios were assessed simultaneously. We have covered air plane crashes to the extent that they have the same effect as tsunami and earthquakes, meaning that they shut down normal safety and cooling functions. \"</p> <p>But campaigners and MEPs said the nuclear industry had been let off too lightly and demanded to know how the commission would enforce standards.</p> <p>Marita Ulvskog, vice president of the Socialists and Democrats grouping in the European Parliament, said: \"There are several nuclear facilities that would not withstand extreme events like an earthquake or a terrorist attack. We must guarantee that all measures are taken to protect human lives and the environment. A nuclear disaster [in one member state] would have catastrophic consequences for neighbouring countries and we need to find a common solution.\"</p> <p>Rebecca Harms, co-president of the Green grouping in the parliament, said that the stress test had \"been orchestrated to cause as little stress to the nuclear industry as possible\". She said: \"There are no real proposals for follow-up. However, the fact that the stress tests failed to address risks in crucial areas \u2013 ageing technology, terrorist attacks or human error \u2013 is a more damning indictment of the whole exercise.\"</p> <p>She insisted that the stress test should not be used as an excuse to prolong the life of elderly reactors: \"At the very least, the commission should be pressing for the security deficiencies identified in the report to be rectified. However, given the prohibitive costs \u2013 with estimates of up to \u20ac25bn \u2013 investors will only be willing to commit to this if the reactors stay online far longer than foreseen for safety reasons. These stress tests cannot be used as an excuse to justify lifetime extensions for decrepit nuclear reactors. If this exercise was serious, the commission should be recommending the closure of unsafe or ageing reactors.\"</p> <p>One nuclear insider, however, said that even under the stress of such a severe natural disaster as the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the threat to the nuclear power stations in Fukushima and elsewhere in Japan had been contained.</p> <p>Greenpeace spokesman Mark Breddy said: \"It's not surprising that the tests, though limited, have uncovered major concerns. Nuclear power is inherently risky, and failures, accidents and close calls happen all the time. But there are serious safety issues that the stress tests haven't looked into. EU governments must act fast by shutting down the oldest and most risky plants and by ordering more thorough testing on the remaining plants.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US Federal Trade Commission has carried out a huge international crackdown on a number of \"tech support\" scams being run out of India which have conned people in the UK, US, Canada and elsewhere out of millions of pounds since 2008.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/phone-scam-india-call-centres\" title=\"\">explained by the Guardian in 2010</a>, the scams used \"boiler room\" tactics, dialling through phone books for English-speaking countries. People who answered the phone were told the call came from Microsoft or their internet service provider, and that the person's computer was \"reporting viruses\". The caller would then perform an unnecessary \"fix\" on the computer and charge the person for it \u2013 and sometimes sign them up to multi-year \"support\" contracts. The cost could run to hundreds of pounds.</p> <p>People in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were targeted because they, like the people carrying out the scam, are English-speaking. The Guardian understands that the scam was worth millions of pounds a year to the organised gangs carrying it out.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2012/10/pecon.shtm\" title=\"\">FTC's request in six cases</a>, a federal district judge froze the US assets of 17 people and 14 companies that have been accused of taking part in the operations. The FTC has also shut down 80 internet domain names and 130 phone numbers used in the US to carry out the scams.</p> <p>The FTC is seeking an end to the scams, and repayments for people who were conned out of money.</p> <p>Though the FTC said it could not put a figure on how many people had been scammed, or how much they had lost, Microsoft \u2013 which has been working with the commission for the past two years to try to catch the criminals \u2013 provided data on more than a thousand people who had been scammed, whose losses averaged $875 each.</p> <p>Microsoft has repeatedly pointed out that it would not call people about any problems with their computers. In some cases, the scammers would try to sell antivirus software from reputable companies, and in some cases would install new copies of Windows on a machine. However the licence key used on the software allowed Microsoft to trace it back to its buyer, which aided the investigation.</p> <p>The fraud occurred in several English-speaking countries. Joining the FTC in the enforcement action were the Australian Communications and Media Authority, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission and the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency. David Vladeck, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said it was working with law enforcement officials in India to catch the alleged perpetrators. The commission has also referred the cases to the US justice department for possible criminal prosecution.</p> <p>The companies whose assets have been frozen are: Pecon Software; PC Care247; Connexxions Infotech; Connexxions IT Services Private Ltd; Zeal IT Solutions; Lakshmi Infosoul Services Private Ltd; Virtual PC Solutions, First PC Solution; Direct PC Solution; Virtual IT Supports; Global Innovative Service; 24x7pchelp; 24x7pctech; Transfront Solutions; New World Services; Megabites Solutions; Mega Bits; Greybytes Cybertech; Bluesystemcare; Shine Solutions Private Ltd. The FTC has also named 17 people who were singly or together directors of the accused companies.</p> <p>The companies involved had US locations which were used to funnel money back to India. Some also have UK offices. However the FTC asserts that the companies used \"virtual\" offices which were in fact just mail-forwarding facilities. The scam also used voice-over-internet phone lines to make them appear to be calling from inside the country being targeted, when in fact the caller was in India.</p> <p>The Guardian's own investigations have found that one gang was using locations and accounts in Canada to transfer money from the scams back to India.</p> <p>The defendants have been charged with violating the FTC Act, which bars \"unfair and deceptive\" commercial practices, breaching the Telemarketing Sales Rule and illegally calling numbers that are on the National Do Not Call Registry.</p> <p>The scheme involved getting a computer user to look at a program called \"Event Viewer\" that is a standard part of the Windows operating system. That displays logs of events occurring on the computer, sometimes with the label \"Warning\" or \"Error\" \u2013 but which in fact have no significance to the smooth running of the computer. The caller would then say that these were due to \"viruses\", that they had been alerted to them remotely, and that they could fix them. They then would use a remote login program to appear to \"fix\" the computer.</p> <p>\"Clearly the defendant's [modus operandi] was to exploit these fears about malware hiding in the machine,\" said the FTC chairman, Jon Leibowitz. \"These scams fleeced English-speaking consumers worldwide likely to the tune of tens of millions of dollars and resulted in innumerable Do Not Call violations in the US.\"</p>",
  "<p>Entering the community of Semoch\u00e1n involves a slow, bumpy drive off the highway. Through the window, perfect lines of young, green palm trees stretch out interminably in the gathering morning heat.</p> <p>A dozen dirt-floored homes dot Semoch\u00e1n, in the northern Guatemalan state of Pet\u00e9n. The predominantly indigenous Q'eqchi residents harvest maize and beans from small plots of family-owned land. But over the past decade, the semi-tropical climate and flat terrain has attracted the interest of palm growers. Hoping to cash in on the growing global demand for palm oil (used mainly in commercial baked goods), they have reportedly bought more than 20,000 hectares of arable land in the region.</p> <p>\"They have encircled us and we no longer have the right to cross our community,\" says Sandra*, who \u2013 since former neighbours sold the plots between her own and the town itself \u2013 must cross an oil palm plantation in order to reach the land she legally owns. An agreement has been reached to allow her access, but she fears the plantation workers, far from honouring it, will continue to intimidate both her and other women in the community with threats of eviction.</p> <p>\"They came on my parcel, and they asked me: 'Are you going to sell your land?' I told them I wouldn't,\" she said of her latest conversation. \"They told me that, someday, I would find myself not enjoying my land any more, no matter what. That is how things were left.\"</p> <p>Residents in several nearby villages are uneasy about the future of their land, with many worried that the environmental side-effects associated with the palm plantations will render it worthless.</p> <p>Santos Natalio Chic, an investigator with the national commission on displaced people in Guatemala, believes that \u2013 beyond the intimidation \u2013 company representatives have intentionally misled residents, whether by claiming that floods will render their land useless or offering spurious guarantees of lifelong employment.</p> <p>\"You never see their promises,\" says Chic. \"They say: 'This will bring development to the communities,' when really what it means is more poverty.\"</p> <p>Chic has heard hundreds of cases of local workers being paid below the national minimum of 68 quetzals (about $8.50) a day, and dozens of workers being let go simply for demanding they receive full pay. Without land to grow food, he points out, it is very difficult for families to survive on such low wages.</p> <p>Many residents believe this is part of a slow, subtle strategy to force out locals, opening up more land for the palm plantations. Workers are brought in from other states to take local jobs, while access to water, forests and roads is blocked or restricted.</p> <p>Sayach\u00e9 mayor Rodrigo Pop says it is no coincidence that communities have been encircled by palm lands. \"The lands have been bought strategically by the company buyers. They have selectively bought up the parcels, so as to circle the towns that have land,\" he says, adding that this puts pressure on the communities.</p> <p>Former Guatemalan economics minister Luis Vel\u00e1squez, the spokesman for the five palm companies operating in the region, denies these claims. He doesn't believe companies would risk paying below the minimum wage, and says people have been free to sell or keep their land as they see fit.</p> <p>Vel\u00e1squez acknowledges that some people may regret selling their land, but is quick to point out that there are signed contracts for every piece of land. Several families claim that, unable to produce a written signature, they signed with a thumbprint; few seem to have been given a copy of the resulting contract.</p> <p>Vel\u00e1squez says the real success of the fledgling industry lies in the creation \u2013 in a region where more than half the population live below the national poverty line of about $3 a day\u2013 of 40,000 jobs on the plantation and 40,000 indirect jobs, supporting the plantations in the communities. This, along with a $2m investment in local development, means the palm industry is making an important contribution to Guatemala's economy, the third weakest in Latin America.</p> <p>\"If it wasn't for the palm plantations, the region would be prone to poverty, violence, hunger and drug trafficking,\" says Vel\u00e1squez, referring to nearby regions affected by chronic malnutrition and the violent southward expansion of Mexico's drug cartels.</p> <p>Yet residents interviewed for this report were unable to discern any concrete results achieved locally by these development funds.</p> <p>Spurred by a wave of spring protests by workers and local residents, palm companies have opened discussions on improving conditions. Demands for better wages, community development, environmental sustainability and access of residents to remaining land and resources top the priority list. All sides agree that positive steps have been made, but for some the need for resolution is pressing.</p> <p>Tanya*, a young mother who lives on the edge of El Canale\u00f1o, says no reason was given for her husband being laid off after four years, allegedly without full pay. But she believes it was because he requested time to harvest food from his parent's lot, one of the few left in the village.</p> <p>\"The companies do not recognise that the salary they are offering just isn't enough,\" she said. \"They don't acknowledge that we also have the right to sow our land in order to eat, because we can't afford to buy food with the pay they offer.\"</p> <p>With no job, and little land, Tanya says they are unsure how they will stay in their town. But for people like Sandra, back in Semoch\u00e1n, the path forward is clearer, however difficult.</p> <p>\"We suffered to get this land,\" she says. \"I am completely sure that I will never sell it, no matter what price they offer. The land here belongs to our children, they are the heirs.\"</p> <p>* <em>Names have been changed to protect the identities of those interviewed</em></p>",

That ran out in the early hours of Thursday, meaning they have to go to magistrates in Aberystwyth to get another extension. In all, police could be given 96 hours to hold Bridger, which would take them through to Saturday.</p> <p>Police are continuing to ramp up the search for April, who went missing while playing near the family home at Machynlleth on Monday evening.</p> <p>A police statement on Thursday morning said they did not need volunteers to help search.</p> <p>\"We do not at the moment need to call upon their assistance and we have made no appeal for any existing volunteers or fresh volunteers to come out to assist us today,\" a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>However, the request was being defied, with people organising themselves into groups and going out to search.</p> <p>One of the organisers, Network Rail worker Carl Jones, confirmed the search was not arranged by the police \u2013 though they were talking with officers and would avoid areas they were asked to stay clear of.</p> <p>He said some people were frustrated that the police seemed to be only targeting the immediate area around Machynlleth. He said he felt the search ought to cover a wider area.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1A35Zus3rko?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1A35Zus3rko\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>More than 200 residents had registered with the volunteer co-ordinators of the local search at the leisure centre in Machynlleth.

In no way are we scaling back our search,\" said Superintendent Ian John. \"We remain completely focused and committed to finding April.\" He said police were working through 1,200 pieces of information provided by the public.</p> <p>Also on Wednesday police took the unusual step of naming the man they were holding. They <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/video/2012/oct/03/april-jones-mark-bridger-video\" title=\"\">released a photograph of 46-year-old Bridger (video)</a> and his left-hand drive Land Rover and appealed for help in piecing together his movements since April vanished.</p> <p>The most visible signs of the search on Wednesday were on and alongside the swollen river Dyfi, which runs through Machynlleth. Vessels from kayaks to RNLI lifeboats and a hovercraft were brought in to help scour the river, its banks, and the large Dyfi estuary.</p> <p>Police said they had pinpointed 20 search sites including homes, outbuildings and the hills and fields that surround the town as well as the river.</p> <p>John said: \"The terrain we're working in has been described as a hostile environment. The ground is treacherous, it's wet, we've got a flooded river we're working around.\" Asked what the chances were of finding April alive so long after she was last seen he said only: \"Our efforts are completely focused on doing that.\"</p> <p>Three experts from the police national search centre had arrived to help co-ordinate the effort and more specialist police searchers from Welsh and English forces had been drafted in.</p> <p>April went missing as she played on her bicycle with friends near her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate around 7pm on Monday. One of her friends told police that apparently April got into a vehicle \"willingly\". It also emerged that April has cerebral palsy. Her family confirmed she had the condition but declined to comment further.</p> <p>The police held four press conferences on Wednesday, reflecting the increasing urgency of the case. At the second one, Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, who is leading the inquiry, said police arrested Bridger at 3.30pm on Tuesday just north of the stone bridge over the Dyfi around a mile from Machynlleth town centre. He was walking towards the town.</p> <p>Bevan said the suspect was wearing a green camouflage jacket and black waterproof trousers over camouflage trousers. His Land Rover was found at a nearby repair garage. The detective said police were trying to piece together Bridger's movements from 5pm on Monday until his arrest. He asked people to look carefully at the images of Bridger and the vehicle and come forward if they had seen anything.</p> <p>At lunchtime on Wednesday April's mother, Coral, 40, made a heart-wrenching appeal for information. \"There must be someone out there who knows where she is and can help the police find her. We are desperate for any news. April is only five years old. Please, please, help find her.\"</p> <p>An update about the search and the process of interviewing Bridger was given on Wednesday evening by which time Bridger had been interviewed twice. Bevan refused to say if he had undergone an \"emergency\" interview, which allows police to speak to a suspect before a lawyer arrives if they believe that by doing so they can save a life.</p> <p>Bevan said only: \"He has been interviewed twice. Clearly our focus in those interviews is to find April. That is what we've been discussing with him.\"</p> <p>Bridger was born in Sutton, south London. He has lived in Machynlleth for more than 25 years, for a time on the estate where April's family live. The Ministry of Defence was checking reports that Bridger was a former soldier.</p> <p>Residents said he worked as a lifeguard at Machynlleth leisure centre. He married in 1990 and is the father of at least three children; one with his ex-wife \u2013 a boy who is now 20 \u2013 and another boy and girl, 12 and 10, by another partner. One of the places police were searching was a whitewashed farmhouse five miles north of Machynlleth, where Bridger had been living for a few weeks.</p> <p>Officers had also been examining factory units, farm buildings and forestry shacks in the area.</p> <p>Police refused to speculate on how close Bridger was to any members of April's family but said they were looking at links as they built a profile of him.</p> <p>Detectives have emphasised that the arrest of Bridger was just one of a number of lines of inquiry they were following.</p>",
  "<p>Following my article <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/05/andrew-mitchell-legacy-aid-depoliticised-development\" title=\"\">last month on Andrew Mitchell's legacy</a>, I received many responses to the idea that politics needs to be brought back into international development discussions in the UK.</p> <p>There was broad agreement that, under the Conservative party, the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) has retreated into an aid agency fixated on technical solutions and efficiency. Political battles are being fought within and between countries across the world, but DfID, and many of its European peers, appear to be sitting them out, preferring to present development as a mixture of bean-counting and results evaluations (which is not to say that audits and accountability are unimportant).</p> <p>Take the growing campaign for a UN general assembly resolution on universal health coverage, something <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2012/oct/01/worldbank-healthinsurance\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley wrote about earlier this week</a>. The push is being led by emerging countries like Thailand, Brazil and Mexico, each basking in the success of their health policies and relishing embarrassing the US, which still has a prehistoric healthcare system. It's clear from looking at the evidence of successful health reforms over the past 100 years that they have emerged from straight-down-the-line political struggles. In the UK, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Ghana, Malaysia, China and many countries in Latin America, the \"healthy wealthy\" have been forced to cross-subsidise the sicker, poorer members of society. Needless to say, the US is doing everything in its power to block this initiative.</p> <p>Where is the UK's voice on these great issues? Basically silent. But this could be changing. I have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jun/03/uk-labour-international-development-politics\" title=\"\">regularly argued in this space</a> that we need to have a more political debate about international development in the UK and that Labour, in particular, must apply its critique of rampant capitalism at home to its international policies as well.</p> <p>Now, finally, Ivan Lewis, the shadow international development secretary, appears to be grasping the nettle. In his speech to the Labour party conference this week, he criticised what he sees as a Conservative belief in trickle-down economics and a simplistic \"public-bad, private-good\" ideology. Lewis declared that it is time for: \"Big global economic and social change. Growth which is sustainable, companies that are both profitable and responsible, meaningful agreements on fair trade and climate change, universal access to free healthcare, compulsory education and social protection. Global human rights with no exemptions for our allies. Women's rights at the heart of conflict resolution. Decent work, decent labour standards for workers everywhere\".</p> <p>Of course, much of the speech was the usual party political guff that <em>conferencistas</em> demand from their spokespeople, and a fairly traditional analysis of aid remained central to Lewis's thinking. But there is no mistaking the change of tone. When Mitchell used to say: \"There is not a Conservative, Liberal Democrat or Labour development policy, but a British one\", the other parties would nod approvingly. Lewis clearly doesn't share this view \u2013 he is setting out a distinctively Labour approach to international development, one that recognises politics are as much at play beyond Britain's borders as within them, and which will be pitted against a Conservative alternative at the next general election. Labour are now even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/30/tessa-jowell-role-international-aid\" title=\"\">advocating an international Sure Start philosophy for early childhood</a>, similar to the one they enacted in the UK, which the Conservatives appear to be dismantling.</p> <p>But Labour does not have a monopoly on vision, compassion or ideas. While widely derided in the aid industry (unsurprisingly, given his fairly full-square attack on it), Conservative grandee <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9547999/Lord-Ashcroft-tells-Coalition-to-turn-off-the-golden-taps-and-stop-flooding-the-developing-world-with-our-money.html\" title=\"\">Lord Ashcroft's well-publicised critique of aid</a> last month is worth a read. Ashcroft warns Justine Greening, the newly appointed development secretary, that she will \"travel the world like a medieval potentate\" to developing countries that want \"tourism and trade, not dollops of aid\". He urges Greening to \"jettison the old-fashioned, neo-colonial approach of your predecessors\" and to \"stop parading as modern-day saviours of developing nations and step into the modern world\".</p> <p>He is wrong to call for a reduction in aid, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/oct/19/development-spending-cut-mistake\" title=\"\">as I have argued</a> in the past. But his outlook on development appears to be better grounded in reality, and more in line with the kind of messages aid recipient countries are sending out, than the perspective of those who still favour a paradigm where rich, western countries offer largesse to the world's poor.</p> <p>And let's not forget the Liberal Democrats, who used to be the most progressive British party on these issues. Where are they hiding?</p> <p>The Conservatives have ideas and instincts on international development that are worthy of debate \u2013 a particular dislike of aid dependence, a belief in private-sector solutions, a focus on auditing and accountability. Let's hope we hear them when Greening gives her first major speech on the subject next week. Let's stop pretending development is like a mathematical equation; it is a political battleground. Let's hear the arguments. Let's have a proper discussion about Britain's future role in supporting development in other countries.</p>",

  "<p>House prices fell for the third month in a row in September, according to the latest monthly report from mortgage lender Halifax.</p> <p>The average UK house price in September 2012 was \u00a3159,486, 0.4% lower than August and 1.2% lower than September 2011. The index also recorded a quarterly decline of 0.5%.</p> <p>Halifax's housing economist Martin Ellis blamed the recession for the \"slight deterioration\", but added that the relatively low mortgage payments in relation to income \"continues to provide support for house prices\".</p> <p>He added that mortgage payments as a ratio of earnings have fallen from a high of 48% in 2007 to 26% in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>Commentators said the figures showed a continued lack of confidence in the housing market. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said he expected house prices to drift down by about 3% from current levels \"in the face of limited market activity, still low and fragile consumer confidence, and muted earnings growth\".</p> <p>Buying agent Gabby Adler said: \"It is fair to say there is now a slight deterioration in outlook. There is still a lack of confidence and until it returns, house prices on the whole will be flat and bump along the bottom, give or take a few variations from region to region.\"</p> <p>The monthly drop matches Nationwide's recent house price announcement, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/02/house-prices-uk-fall-nationwide\" title=\"House prices in UK fall as annual decline hits 1.4%\">also showed a 0.4% fall</a> but put the annual decline at 1.4%.</p> <p>According to Halifax, the average home is worth 20.1% less than it was in August 2007, when the average price peaked at \u00a3199,612. The lender expects house prices to remain \"broadly unchanged over the rest of this year and into 2013.\"</p>",
  "<p>Here at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, I run an internal blog for our in-house communicators, who support more than 270 embassies and high commissions around the world, each one of them doing its bit to communicate UK foreign policy.</p> <p>I took over as head of communications excellence in March 2012. Before that, I ran marketing campaigns for other government departments for10 years, with a stint in crisis communications, and before that, I worked in magazines and newspapers, and had a little branding consultancy on the side. It's my job to help colleagues across the office get the skills, guidance, and support they need to deliver excellent communications work as part of excellent foreign policy. It's a fantastic opportunity to work on global issues and alongside some of the most dedicated and capable people in public service.&#xa0;</p> <p>We often call it public diplomacy, and it works best when it draws on our 'soft power'. In a nutshell, power is the abilityto get what you want. You can go about this by threat or by coercion (hard power), or you can attract and co-opt others so that they want what you want (soft power). The phrase soft power, coined by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power\" title=\"\">Harvard professor Joseph Nye</a> in 2004, is now widely used in international affairs and it is acknowledged that it is now less possible than ever before to achieve our international goals by exerting hard power alone. We need to make the most of all the things that have potential to make us attractive - our culture, values and policies.</p> <p>There are many examples of these. Here's just one.</p> <p>At the beginning of 2012, we went to Buenos Airesto work with the communications teams across Latin America. We talked about lots of things, including the Falklands, but what really came out of it for me was a gem of an idea about using the <a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/2012_olympic_games_and_paralympic_games/8442.aspx\" title=\"\">GREAT</a> campaign and our soft power to reach out to a new generation in Cuba.</p> <p>The idea came from our comms officer there who went back to Havana and put together a good business case (so good, in fact, that commercial sponsors like Virgin Atlantic and Diageo found funding for it), for a campaign which included music, theatre, dance, cinema, historical exhibits and a marketing communications push. In the words of our then-ambassador to Cuba, the campaign transformed our visibility and enabled us to reach a popular audience usually off limits to an embassy, change attitudes towards the UK and further our prosperity and London 2012 objectives. Cuban contacts, including ministers, have lined up to shower praise on the embassy while the rest of the diplomatic corps cannot hide their envy.</p> <p>It's great to feel that you helped light a spark like that, and I'm always impressed by how creative our own people can be.

  "<p>Police investigating the disappearance of five-year-old April Jones are increasing the scale of the search for the missing schoolgirl as they continue to question her suspected abductor.</p> <p>Already, hundreds of specially-trained police officers have been joined by dog handlers, mountain rescue teams, coastguards and volunteer search teams as they comb the \"hostile\" territory in and around the town of Machynlleth in mid-Wales.</p> <p>Supt Ian John described the search as \"unprecedented in the UK\" but said it continued to build. \"I want to emphasise this is a growing operation. In no way are we scaling back our search,\" he said. \"We remain completely focused and committed to finding April.\" John said police were working through 1,200 pieces of information provided by the public.</p> <p>Police on Wednesday took the highly unusual step of naming the man they are holding on suspicion of abduction, 46-year-old Mark Bridger, who is known to April's family. They released a photograph of him and his left-hand drive Land Rover and appealed for help in piecing together his movements since April vanished. They were given an extra 12 hours to question him on Wednesday.</p> <p>The most visible signs of the search on Wednesday were on and alongside the swollen River Dyfi, which runs through Machynlleth. Vessels from kayaks to RNLI lifeboats and a hovercraft were brought in to help scour the river, its banks, and the huge Dyfi estuary.</p> <p>But police said they had pinpointed a total of 20 search sites including homes, outbuildings and the hills and fields that surround the town as well as the river.</p> <p>John said: \"The terrain we're working in has been described as a hostile environment. The ground is treacherous, it's wet, we've got a flooded river we're working around.\" Asked what the chances were of finding April alive so long after she was last seen he said only: \"Our efforts are completely focused on doing that.\"</p> <p>He revealed that three experts from the police national search centre had arrived in the town to help co-ordinate the effort and more specialist police searchers from Welsh and English forces were on the way. April went missing as she played on her bicycle with friends near her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate around 7pm on Monday. One of her friends told police that apparently April got into a vehicle \"willingly\". It also emerged that April has cerebral palsy. Her family confirmed she had the condition but declined to comment further. But it is bound to add to the family's concerns.</p> <p>The police tactics on Wednesday reflected the increasing urgency of the case. At a first press conference shortly after first light, police said they hoped information from the \u2013 still unnamed \u2013 suspect would lead to the recovery of April. By mid-morning another press conference was called during which Bridger was named, his image issued and details of his arrest given.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, who is leading the inquiry, said police arrested Bridger at 3.30pm on Tuesday just north of the stone bridge over the Dyfi around a mile from Machynlleth town centre. He was walking towards the town.</p> <p>Bevan said the suspect was wearing a green camouflage jacket and black waterproof trousers over camouflage trousers. His Land Rover was found at a nearby repair garage. The detective said police were trying to piece together Bridger's movements from 5pm on Monday until his arrest. He asked people to look carefully at the images of Bridger and the vehicle and come forward if they had seen anything. \"Please don't assume that someone else has contacted us,\" he added.</p> <p>At lunchtime April's mother, Coral, 40, appeared at a third press conference to make a heart-wrenching appeal for information. \"There must be somewhere out there who knows where she is and can help the police find her. We are desperate for any news. April is only five years old. Please, please, help find her.\"</p> <p>An update about the search and the process of interviewing Bridger was given on Wednesday evening at a fourth press conference.</p> <p>By that time Bridger had been interviewed twice. Bevan refused to say if he had undergone an \"emergency\" interview, which allows police to speak to a suspect before a lawyer arrives if they believe that by doing so they can save a life.</p> <p>Bevan said only: \"He has been interviewed twice. Clearly our focus in those interviews is to find April. That is what we've been discussing with him.\"</p> <p>Bridger was born in Sutton, south London. He has lived in Machynlleth for more than 25 years, for a time on the estate where April's family live. The Ministry of Defence was checking reports that Bridger was a former soldier.</p> <p>Local people said he worked as a lifeguard at Machynlleth leisure centre, where hundreds of volunteers gathered earlier in the week to help the search for April. Bridger married in 1990. He is the father of at least three children; one with his ex-wife \u2013 a boy who is now 20 \u2013 and another boy and girl, 12 and 10, by another partner. One of the places police were searching was a whitewashed farmhouse five miles north of Machynlleth, where Bridger had been living for a few weeks.</p> <p>Officers had also been examining factory units, farm buildings and forestry shacks in the area.</p> <p>Police refused to speculate on how close Bridger was to any members of April's family but said they were looking as links as they built a profile of him.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, hundreds of members of the public joined the search for April, some travelling from hundreds of miles, to assist. John said the police had been \"overwhelmed\" by members of the public volunteering to help the police. But he said the conditions were \"challenging\" and police were worried that the volunteers could put themselves at risk. He asked people to leave the search to the experts but police have taken a register of people who have offered to help in case they need to call on them again.</p> <p>Police emphasised that the arrest of Bridger was just one of a number of lines of inquiry they were following.</p>",

  "<p>When Kristin Davis became involved with wildlife conservation, the combination of celebrity and cause probably seemed less incongruous. On holiday in a Kenyan safari park, the actor, who made her name as prim heiress Charlotte York in hit TV show Sex and the City, joined the hunt for a lost baby elephant when a Maasai elder waved down the truck in which she was travelling and raised the alarm.</p> <p>She followed the trail for two days, and filmed what happened when the team found the animal, later named Chaimu after the lava rocks <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNGWBk733hg&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">where she was found</a>.</p> <p>\"She kept trying to charge us, she was so traumatised and angry. We had to cover her eyes and tie her feet, you feel so horrible but you know you're helping them, and wet her skin down because she was so hot. She had been eating dirt so her digestive system was all messed up, and you can't feed them water when they are lying down in case it gets in their lungs so eventually we had to get her up and un-blindfold her so she could drink with her trunk in the proper way, and then we had to carry her on a people stretcher which was kind of hysterical.\"</p> <p>Back at the eco-tourism lodge where Davis was staying, the rangers called the <a href=\"http://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/\" title=\"\">David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust</a> whose staff arrived with supplies of elephant formula milk, antibiotics, and a plane in which to transport Chiamu to the famous nursery where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Sheldrick\" title=\"\">Dame Daphne Sheldrick</a> pioneered the hand-rearing of orphaned wild animals.</p> <p>Davis checked up on Chaimu's progress via email and was delighted, when she offered to help with a fundraiser the Sheldricks were holding in New York, to realise they had no idea who she was.</p> <p>\"They didn't know who I was which was fantastic! I didn't know they didn't know who I was but whatever, it didn't matter, right? So I had this pure relationship with them for a good long time before they realised I was an actress. Even now it's very hard to get them to ask me to do anything, they're so shy and reticent, I mean it's adorable!\"</p> <p>As Davis recounts all this over a starter-sized chicken salad in the packed restaurant of a Covent Garden hotel, it sounds like a distant memory. Nowadays she is the patron and very public face of the charity founded in memory of David Sheldrick, first warden of Tsavo national park, and is in London for a black-tie dinner to launch <a href=\"http://www.iworry.org/\" title=\"\">a new anti-ivory campaign</a>.</p> <p>In a knee-length red dress and red heels at least six inches high, with a publicist on hand to whisk her off to the next appointment, she looks every inch the entertainment A-lister who over the summer dated West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin, and made her Broadway debut alongside Cybill Shepherd and Angela Lansbury playing a presidential candidate's wife in a revival of Gore Vidal's play The Best Man.</p> <p><a href=\"http://officialkristindavis.com/\" title=\"\">Davis's website</a> shows cheerful pictures of her grinning as she feeds a baby elephant with a giant bottle. Yet as we talk, the heart-warming side of her charity work \u2013 the infants rescued, the bonds formed, the happy endings of animals successfully returned to the wild bringing their babies back to visit the orphanage \u2013 is soon overshadowed by horror. Drawn to what she saw as an inspiring place where dedicated people were making their mark on nature, Davis now finds herself at the epicentre of a wildlife disaster.</p> <p>Estimates suggest around 38,000 elephants were slaughtered for their ivory in sub-Saharan Africa last year. No one knows how many survive in conflict zones in Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia, where rare forest elephants are even more at risk. Meanwhile rhinos teeter on the brink of extinction, with fewer than 25,000 left. Seizures of illegal ivory rose from 13 in 2007 to 448 last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/04/rhino-horn-wildlife-trade-vietnam\" title=\"\">and is likely to rise again in 2012</a>.</p> <p>The reason is increased demand in China and Thailand where ivory has been prized for centuries and more people can now afford to buy it. Last month <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/world/africa/africas-elephants-are-being-slaughtered-in-poaching-frenzy.html\" title=\"\">a report on the front page of the New York Times</a> attempted to map the connections between civil war in Africa, consumers in Asia and criminal traffickers, and suggested that warlords including Joseph Kony are using proceeds of illegal ivory sales to buy arms.</p> <p>\"Ivory is basically a blood diamond,\" Davis says, \"if you buy it, you're buying the new blood diamonds.\"</p> <p>Unlike rhino horn, gathered for non-existent medicinal properties, chiefly sold in Vietnam and entirely illegal, ivory can be bought and sold legally. The \"Say no to ivory\" campaign that Davis is fronting aims to change this by persuading the <a href=\"http://www.cites.org/eng/cop/index.php\" title=\"\">2013 meeting of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> (Cites) to prevent African governments from selling stockpiled ivory, arguing that such licenses stimulate the market and fuel poaching. On the other side, southern African countries supported by some NGOs argue that the income from legal sales helps support elephant conservation. All agree that the Cites decision is crucial.</p> <p>But while reports increasingly focus on militarisation, with wildlife patrols and poachers engaged in an arms race, and NGOs plead with governments to address the role of organised crime, it is the way unarmed villagers have begun killing the animals that makes Davis cry.</p> <p>\"You'd like to hear some gruesomeness? All right\" she says, as she describes going to see an elephant trapped by its foot in stolen electricity cable, then tied to a tree around which it walked for several days until it died.</p> <p>\"And then they saw its face off, and then you walk like half a mile and there'll be another one. It's bad. It's really hard. But this is the truth of what's happening and someone needs to pay attention.\"</p> <p>Tears dabbed from beneath her eyes with a napkin, she says she admires actor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/13/observer-ethical-awards-2012-judge-colin-firth\" title=\"\">Colin Firth</a> and his wife <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/04/livia-firth-design-fashion-recycle\" title=\"\">Livia</a> for their environmental activism, and talks of her nerves about US presidential election: \"I don't know if actors talking about their opinions helps but I'm for women's rights and women's choices so obviously that doesn't really go with the Republican side.\"</p> <p>Up all night with her teething baby daughter while working in New York over the summer (14-month-old Gemma, adopted last year by Davis at one day old, is with her mother while she is away), Davis is already planning their first trip to Kenya together. \"I figure if I'm going to mess her sleep up it should be for something really good. Kids go to the nursery all the time and they love it. Little elephants are so cute and they play soccer, and they get in the mud.\"</p> <p>A film script she was sent recently did not live up to Gore Vidal but she rejects the idea that it is all doom and gloom for women actors over 40 (Davis is 47). \"Look at Meryl Streep's career. Of course she's a genius, I'm not saying I'm a genius, but at least there are people out there now that you can look to and say, wow.\"</p> <p>Sometimes she thinks about giving it all up and moving to Kenya, but then her friends the Sheldricks beg her not to \u2013 \"because they need me to be able to talk to people like yourself\".</p> <p>\"That's one thing about ageing,\" she says. \"You kind of get to a point where you don't feel so ambitious any more, you know?

  "<p>Sales of clothing made from organic cotton bucked the gloomy picture for organic products in 2011, rising in the UK by 2% against the year before while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/02/organic-products-sales-uk-fall\" title=\"\">food and drink fell 3.7% in the same period</a>.</p> <p>The figures, published by trade body the Soil Association on Thursday, come as campaigners at the SA and Global Organic Textile Standard <a href=\"http://www.cottonedon.org/\" title=\"\">called on textile manufacturers and retailers across the world to produce and sell only certified organic cotton</a>.</p> <p>The SA's policy director Lord Peter Melchett will urge companies to support the new drive, which also aims to help consumers looking for ethically-produced garments, at the <a href=\"http://textileexchange.org/event/2012-sustainable-textiles-conference-hong-kong\" title=\"\">Sustainable Textiles conference in Hong Kong</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>UK sales of organic textiles are now estimated to be worth over \u00a3100m, while last year the SA saw the turnover of its 79 textile licensees</p> <p>increase by 2% to \u00a312m.</p> <p>Four-fifths of demand comes from major retailers and brands incorporating organic cotton into their manufacturing. In addition to clothing and linen, a small but well-established market for organic cotton is women's sanitary products: market leader <a href=\"http://www.natracare.com/Default.aspx?CultureId=en-GB\" title=\"\">Natracare</a> grew by 9% in the year to June 2011.</p> <p>Approximately 65% of world cotton production currently comes from</p> <p>genetically-modified crops. But the SA says that some brands are failing to commit to organic standards, opting instead for easier, lower-level schemes or even nothing at all.</p> <p>Melchett said: \"Organic cotton is proven to deliver positive benefits for people and the environment. When it comes to making sustainability claims you can trust, nothing beats it.\"</p> <p>High-street brands featured in a lengthy report being presented to the conference include fashion label H&amp;M, which is the number one user of organic cotton worldwide and sportswear brand Nike, which is the third largest user of organic cotton in the world. M&amp;S said in 2011/12 it had sold over 8m garments from 'sustainable' cotton, which can include clothes made from either Fairtrade, organic or <a href=\"http://bettercotton.org/better-cotton/the-better-cotton-system/\" title=\"\">'Better Cotton Initiative'</a> cotton.</p> <p>But smaller brands such as <a href=\"http://www.peopletree.co.uk/\" title=\"\">People Tree</a> and <a href=\"http://www.seasaltcornwall.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Seasalt</a> have been pioneers in sustainability, producing organic clothes which are fully certified throughout production and processing. Leading designers Vivienne Westwood and Paul Smith have both produced certified organic T-shirts.</p> <p>An SA spokeswoman said: \"Larger brands tend to do a lot of 'blending' \u2013 using organic alongside non-organic. The issue is partly about shortage of supply of organic cotton, due to the dominance of the GM corporations. That is why the campaign is pressing big brands to sign up and drive the demand for organic, non-GM cotton.\"</p>"
