  "<h2><strong>9 August 2007</strong><br></h2> <p>BNP Paribas freeze three of their funds, indicating that they have no way of valuing the complex assets inside them known as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), or packages of sub-prime loans. It is the first major bank to acknowledge the risk of exposure to sub-prime mortgage markets. Adam Applegarth (right), Northern Rock's chief executive, later says that it was \"the day the world changed\"</p> <p><strong>Larry Elliott, economics editor, said:</strong> \"As far as the financial markets are concerned, August 9 2007 has all the resonance of August 4 1914.

But now that demand for securitised mortgages has fallen, Northern Rock faces a liquidity crisis and it needs a loan from the British government. This sparks fears that the bank will shortly go bankrupt \u2013 prompting customers to queue round the block to withdraw their savings.

Instead of coming to the bank, where we would be photographed coming in the front door, we were all to meet outside the McDonald's in Liverpool Street where we would be picked up in a people-carrier with darkened windows and driven in through the back of the bank. There were two problems with this. Firstly, Robert Peston had already broken the story about Northern Rock. Secondly, there were two McDonald's outside Liverpool Street.

  "<p>There can be few more poignant or bizarre illustrations of how the classically mighty are fallen than the fate of modern Greco-Roman wrestlers.</p> <p>Since it was first introduced to the games in 708 BC, exponents of the noble sport would anoint themselves with oil before strolling on to the sand to prove their strength, prowess and discipline to the spectators and each other.</p> <p>The lunchtime of Monday 6 August 2012, however, finds their latter-day incarnations squeezed into lycra singlets and soft leather boots and parading around the ExCeL, a venue traditionally beloved of arms dealers, Star Wars fans and boozy corporate types gagging for the spilling of some pugilistic blood.</p> <p>But then, despite its place as one of the world's oldest competitive activities and impeccable Olympic pedigree, Greco-Roman wrestling was never going to find itself honoured with the kind of bespoke arena granted to the likes of athletics, cycling and swimming.</p> <p>Perhaps if there were more domestic interest \u2013 and had Team GB been able to field a single entry in the sport \u2013 a stately wrestling dome might have sprung up in east London. But what the odd and primal discipline of Greco-Roman wrestling lacks in glamour and truly global appreciation, it makes up for in simplicity, history and the obsessive dedication it engenders in its fans.</p> <p>It also offers a surreal glimpse of a parallel Olympic world where union flags are conspicuous by their absence, where English chanting is seldom heard and where not every encounter is another showdown between the usual suspects. Hence the Iranian squaring up to the Iraqi, the Chinese contender facing off against the Hungarian and the Cuban taking on the Egyptian.</p> <p>Greco-Roman wrestling also harbours two other great attractions. First is its refreshing brevity: competitors have just three two-minute rounds to establish their superiority by means of throws, locks and clinches. Second is the fact that, for all its lofty heritage and curious technicalities, it is so primal as to be instantly familiar.</p> <p>Even if you've never been to a match before, you will have seen something not wildly removed from it as a child in the classroom at breaktime, or outside the pub on Saturday night when two drunks who were friends minutes before suddenly thrash around on the ground trying to extract funds for the next drink from each other's pockets.</p> <p>The more quotidian similarities, however, end in the highest weight category, in which two 120kg slabs of muscle are pitted against each other. At such times, Greco-Roman wrestling seems less a sport than a fleshy treatise on the effects of unstoppable forces on immovable objects.</p> <p>Johan Euren, a Swedish plumber weighing in at 118kg, got off to a flying start in his qualifying round against the Kazakh student Nurmakhan Tinaliyev, defeating his opponent 3-0 despite Tinaliyev's two kilo weight advantage. Apart from what appeared to be a spot of lycra-induced nipple chafing, the Swede insisted he was on top form.</p> <p>\"I feel very well,\" he said after the match. \"To beat the world bronze medallist in the first bout gives you a good feeling.\"</p> <p>Sadly for Euren, the feeling was not to last and he was beaten in the semis by Estonia's Heiki Nabi, who sailed past for a gold medal showdown with the Cuban wrestler Mija\u00edn L\u00f3pez N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who took the top spot in Beijing four years ago.</p> <p>After pummelling Abdelrahman Eltrabily of Egypt, Guram Pherselidze of Georgia and Turkey's Riza Kayaalp to reach the final, the 29-year-old Olympic champion was keeping calm and still talking strategy. The day's success, he explained, was all down to the correct application of technique.</p> <p>\"In the first round I wanted to stay in a standing position and then try my favourite technique,\" said L\u00f3pez. \"In the second round I got tired a bit, but finally I managed to perform my favourite technique again.\"</p> <p>As the action lulled before Monday night's gold-medal bout and the bars beckoned, some of the fans who had travelled to London to honour their heroes and watch them sweat and grapple under the harsh lights of the ExCel paused to reflect on the art of Greco-Roman wrestling. Many claimed that, regardless of the scorelines and the inescapably Cuban/Estonian nature of the final, their country was in fact the greatest when it came to the sport.</p> <p>\"It's a strong men's sport,\" said one fan from Tbilisi. \"It is very popular in Georgia because we are very good at it. I think Georgia is the best team in the world.\"</p> <p>Beny Betong, a 36-year-old fan from Narvik, would probably have taken issue with that assertion. But, clad in a Norwegian flag and Viking helmet and clutching four bottles of beer, he was happy to share his thoughts on the appeal of Greco-Roman wrestling.</p> <p>\"It's a fast sport and it's a hard sport,\" he said. \"It's fun to watch and it's not for girly men.\"</p>",
  "<p>After the gold rush here was a harvest of a different kind for Great Britain's Olympians. With the entire home Olympic experience threatening to turn rather giddily medal-coloured in the glow of an improbable weekend of athletic success, there was something resembling a rush for the exits on Monday afternoon as four British teams left their home Olympics within the space of an hour and a half \u2013 and not just these Olympics but perhaps even all Olympics. For the rag-tag brigades of Team GB handball, basketball, volleyball and water polo it may be not so much au revoir as adieu after seven years and several million pounds in the making, followed by one short week in bloom.</p> <p>This was a glorious star-burst of British failure, defeat without dishonour from this estimable quartet of part-timers. By 5.00pm the hand-ballers had gone. Minutes later the volleyballers were done too. At 6.20 it was the turn of the basketballers to trudge off into Olympic hiatus, just as water polo began its own final goodbye 500 metres away. On Saturday this correspondent had witnessed in the flesh five British Olympic gold medal performances. Here was the flip-side, a rat-a-tat of Olympic evictions, with handball kicking off the reverse-golden run at the Copper Box where Team GB faced Iceland in the final match of an infectious Olympic week.</p> <p>Handball was established in Britain only six years ago, a direct response to impending Olympic-dom. It is a brilliant sport, though, a cross between basketball and five-a-side football that revolves around its array of bravura close-in finishes: the pile-driver, the slot to the corner, even the cheeky dink, the palm-Pirlo. On Sunday the Duchess of Cambridge had popped into the changing rooms to congratulate Britain's women after their match against Croatia (they lost all five). And here every seat was full again as the players emerged for their own glorious moribund farewell.</p> <p>As Britain's men edged into the lead early on to vast roars inside the Box, anything seemed possible, with the Guardian columnist Bobby White in astonishing form, not so much blocking shots left right and centre as simply blocking any shots at all, such is the hapless lot of the handball goalkeeper. We will rock you, the crowd chanted, close to sporting delirium, but Team GB was already being rocked. A rocking was undoubtedly in progress. Whither handball now? Could this really be the end of this surge of unexpected momentum? Let's hope not. To paraphrase Whit Stillman, handball is surely too great and too much fun to be gone forever.</p> <p>Six miles across town at Earls Court, the first and perhaps last British men's Olympic volleyball team were underway in their own final dead rubber. This cobbled together odd-job of part-timers were sure of a rapturous reception from the temporary stands but volleyball too faces a fraught Olympic future.</p> <p>If the men's team has an ad hoc feel, the women's team are the stuff of a stirring Hollywood underdogs movie script. They lost their funding before the Games but decided to soldier on in self-sustaining fashion, organising charity bike rides and the like. Both teams exit with heads held high but also beneath a pall of uncertainty. Who needs them now, all Olympic duty done?</p> <p>If nothing else, those involved have an unforgettable story to tell. Perhaps, fertilised by Olympic exposure, volleyball can rise from the leisure centre floor and leap for the strip-lights. For now defeat by Argentina was a fifth Olympic shellacking for these estimable conscripts of the block and smash.</p> <p>And still they came. At the Stratford basketball arena there was a similar sense of ending, albeit perhaps not of a full stop. In the event, with the exit gate looming, Team GB's basketballers produced the best result in modern British basketball history, a 90-58 tournament thrashing of China. The greatest result, that is, in the past seven years, before which Britain did not have a men's team at all, astonishingly given the global reach of the sport. A decent showing at the European Championship finally persuaded the International Basketball Federation to dole out a host nation slot at these Games, coupled of course with the presence of the wonderful Luol Deng of the Chicago Bulls, who has been on board as team leader all along.</p> <p>Deng it was who led GB to victory inside what is known locally as The Marshmallow, a large disposable arena that resembles, from a distance, a giant screwed up ball of paper, and which is due to be dismantled after the Paralympic Games and shipped off to Rio. If the atmosphere inside the more cavernous Crumpled-Ball-Of-Paper lacked the Box's fevered handballisms, this is perhaps understandable. This is not Dodgeball, an Underdog Tale. It is instead a toehold for a major global industry, one that is like football rather slumming it here. There were loud, if not unconstrained, cheers as GB moved to 72-48 in the final quarter. And at the end there was a protracted musketeer-style hand grab from Team GB and some tears too as the players walked off. This team will be back, albeit shorn of its Games-bound gloss. The Olympic adventure may yet even turn out to be a high watermark for Britain's basketballers.</p> <p>Even as they departed, three sides of Great Britain's quadruple Olympic eviction already complete, the water polo team were under way half a kilometre across the park, another dead-rubber appearance for Britain\"s minor sport legions and an uphill task against the mid-table Montenegrins. Technically Britain are the third most successful Olympic water polo nation of all time, though they have not actually sent a team to an Olympics in 52 years. Again this is a labour of love for amateur players corralled into an Olympic presence. Warmly received, roundly defeated and out of their home Games at the first hurdle, Team GB water polo were at least in ample company on Monday evening.</p>",
  "<p>Planetary exploration is expensive \u2013 as Curiosity's $2.5bn robotic landing on Mars on Monday morning<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/06aug_success/\" title=\"\"> certainly shows</a> \u2013 but it is not an expensive luxury. The more we learn about the other planets, the better we know this one. A study of Earth without reference to the rest of the solar system would be a bit like the story of the UK without a mention of neighbours across the North Sea or the Channel: pointless and dangerously wrong.</p> <p>The more useful question is whether Nasa could have spent less, and got more for its buck, and that may be more usefully answered when the great experiment is over. All planetary research involves a gamble in which the risks are proportional to the potential winnings. Engineers and scientists had to devise a way of packing autonomous, powered instruments into the lightest possible vehicle, despatch it on an eight-month, 350m mile journey through unpredictable barrages of scorching radiation, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/curiosity-daredevil.html\" title=\"\">smash it </a>into a turbulent and alien atmosphere at 13,000mph and seven minutes later bring it delicately to touchdown on an unpredictable surface.</p> <p>The ostensible reason for the Mars Science Laboratory mission is the search for evidence of bygone Martian life.

This</a> requires a delivery system that can touch down on an alien surface, choose some suitable soil, scoop it up and bring it safely back to Earth. And that, in turn, would be in preparation for the most dangerous and difficult mission of all: <a href=\"http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/05/nasa-aims-for-human-rendezvous-at-mars-in-2033.html\" title=\"\">a human expedition to Mars. Inevitably</a>, some have asked: is it worth it?</p> <p>The great space adventure began in 1957 as cold war posturing. By 1962, satellite technology driven by government investment had begun to change for ever global communications, terrestrial navigation and our understanding of this planet, its oceans and its atmosphere. Because launch costs are prodigious, scientists and engineers worked to devise ever smaller, more efficient and more sophisticated detectors and computing systems, ever smarter automatons and ever surer ways of protecting astronauts and cosmonauts in the orbiting laboratories that have circled the planet. This in turn has delivered expertise to industry to advance human health, create wealth, fuel the startling speed of technological change \u2013 and to present humanity with a dramatic new perspective on <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2010/02/12/123614938/an-alien-view-of-earth\" title=\"\">its only home</a>.</p> <p>Market forces now routinely exploit the space around the planet. Only governments and international agencies, however, have the resources to blaze the new trails across the heavens, to quite literally break new ground on distant planets. Curiosity got there, so it now looks like a good bet. And science can begin to collect the winnings.</p>",
  "<p>The future of democracy in Syria is the subject of many concerns: people are worried about the treatment of minorities and women, possible acts of revenge, and the likelihood of <a href=\"http://wagingnonviolence.org/2011/12/transitional-justice-in-between-dictatorship-and-democracy/\" title=\"\">transitional justice</a>. Some ask about universal human rights. Others exaggerate fears of religious tyranny.</p> <p>But ultimately all these anxieties \u2013 intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 only serve the interests of the rapists and child killers of Bashar al-Assad's regime.</p> <p>We believe the position to take on Assad and his cabal is essentially a moral one. It is no longer a matter of political debate. Syrians must put their case to the court of global public opinion in the following direct manner: Assad, are you prepared to accept thousands of documented crimes, the torture of children and the rape of women by the state apparatus that should protect them?</p> <p>Behind the concerns for democracy in a post-Assad Syria is typical negative stereotyping of Islamic society. Is it fair that after half a century of totalitarian rule the world should disregard a civilisation whose existence extends so deep into history? The Syrian cities of Damascus, Aleppo and Homs are so ancient that their first inhabitants are not known. The eastern shores of the Mediterranean share a long history and a crucible of cultures, religions and peoples, who have always coexisted.</p> <p>The history of Syria did not begin with the Assad family. There are in Syria today descendants of peoples that go back hundreds of years before the birth of Christ. Over centuries Christians and Jews have lived together with Muslims, without restrictions on their rights. Syria is proud to preserve the <a href=\"http://www.omniglot.com/writing/syriac.htm\" title=\"\">Syriac language</a>, which was the means of translation from older civilisations during the early Islamic era. And only in Syria are there communities that still speak Aramaic, the language of Christ.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14703995\" title=\"\">modern history of Syria since its formation after the first world war </a>has also witnessed its ability to preserve its pluralist nature and protect universal human rights. Since the 1920 national conference that founded the modern state, all the elements of Syrian society have taken part in cultural and political affairs \u2013 a reality that continued until the last truly elected parliament, overthrown by the military on 8 March 1963, hijacking public life in Syria until now.</p> <p>The future that Syrians aspire to is an extension of that earlier era. After 50 years of autocratic rule, our national position and political record emphasises that we will not move towards autocracy, be that religious, political or social. The Muslim Brotherhood is committed to a Syria in which citizenship is the basis of rights and duties, and Syrians can reconstruct their unified civil society where the concept of majority and minority gradually disappears. Women must be given ample opportunity to assert themselves so future generations can play their crucial part in this national project.</p> <p>Some have sought to distort the noble image of our revolution, depicting it as a proxy for foreign interests repeating the propaganda of the decaying regime. Nothing could be more erroneous. This is, indeed, the ultimate insult to the tens of thousands who have given their lives for a democratic, free and prosperous Syria \u2013 in what is truly a people's revolution that, against all odds, has reached every corner of the country. Our vision of a fully independent Syria, master of its destiny, protects its people while rejecting the pitfalls of subservience and foreign control.</p> <p>With regard to transitional justice, we believe that the ruling clique has transgressed all boundaries of aggression, and that the desire for reprisal is inevitable. But our faith emphasises that retribution must be enacted through a fair judicial process. There should be no revenge killings, and we reject the targeting of any group on religious, sectarian or political grounds. We are worried that the international community's exaggerated reiteration of concern for minorities justifies the slaughter of the majority, and is counterproductive.</p> <p>The Syria that we aspire to is a civil state that is sovereign and in which the individual enjoys all the fundamental rights guaranteed in international laws and conventions of human rights, without any discrimination on the basis of religion, sect, ethnicity or social background. We seek to build a state founded on a civil constitution with separation of powers, and where all citizens, men and women, will participate in its governance through the ballot box in a free and fair manner that allows the election of the most capable to every office.</p> <p>As I write this article, my besieged city of Aleppo \u2013 under bombardment from ground and air \u2013 is without water, electricity, food or medicine.

  "<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I was born and raised in this country. I played little league baseball. My Mom was a soccer mom. I'm a diehard Yankees fan. I'm an American.</p> </blockquote> <p>As an American Sikh, this was my most \"quotable quote\" in the news media during the year or so after 9/11. Those words worked well for reporters or producers framing hate crimes stories back then as \"crimes of ignorance\" against a small, misunderstood minority.</p> <p>So why, almost 11 years later, in the wake of Sunday's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/06/wisconsin-suspect-wade-michael-page\">shootings at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin</a>, do I find myself uttering those words again to reporters?</p> <p>Across the country, Sikh Americans are asking themselves similar questions as they are once again pressed to explain themselves to the public. One would hope that almost 11 years after that fateful day, and more than 100 years after Sikhs came to the United States,&#xa0;there would be a better understanding of Sikhs and their contributions to America's well-being.</p> <p>But the 24-hour news cycle does not work that way. Fed a steady diet of Bin Laden and Taliban images, most Americans simply associate the turban, which Sikh men wear as an expression of faith, with terrorism. Turban equals terrorist in the minds of too many.</p> <p>In part, Sikh Americans are collateral damage of a modern climate that rarely has time for explanations of our culture, our heritage, and our beliefs. This enduring legacy of 9/11 continues to stubbornly attach itself to our community. Not only do many people not know of the peaceful beliefs of our faith, but they wrongly associate us with acts of unspeakable terrorism.</p> <p>At present, we don't know whether the shooter, Wade Michael Page was motivated by these mistaken beliefs. His reported association with white supremacist groups may mean that he was motivated by a more generalized hatred of non-whites. But we do know that far too many Americans have misguided prejudices about the Sikh community \u2013 just as they do of the American Muslim community, whose law-abiding and loyal citizens often suffer those same \"crimes of ignorance\".</p> <p>While Sikh Americans are part of the national fabric, working in every profession, serving in our armed forces, and holding important positions in civic life, at the same time, Sikh Americans experience an alarming rate of hate crimes, job discrimination, school bullying, and racial profiling. </p> <p>Still, there are rays of light in this tragedy. On Sunday, CNN and other print and broadcast outlets expended more constructive copy on Sikhs than I have ever witnessed. Journalists of all sorts rushed to explain the basic tenets of the Sikh religion and the practice of our faith.&#xa0;To be fair, the American Sikh community also has to do more to share our heritage with our neighbors. We need a more organized effort to persuade schools to teach children about their Sikh classmates, more meaningful interfaith outreach, and more well-known and accessible spokespeople.</p> <p>It may take years of concerted effort by Sikhs, the media, civil society, and government to&#xa0;create an environment where Sikhs are respected and even celebrated in their communities, but with this great tragedy comes the great responsibility to make sure that the educational work gets done. We all deserve to live in a society where no one need fear violent attack \u2013 whether at a temple, mosque, synagogue or church \u2013 simply because of our ethnic and religious identity.</p>",
  "<h2>Central bankers</h2> <p><strong>Alan Greenspan, chairman US Federal Reserve 1987-2006</strong><br>A disciple of libertarian icon Ayn Rand, Greenspan became chairman of the Fed just in time to save the global economy from the 1987 stock market crash from becoming a full-blown disaster. He went on preside over the boom years of the 90s and lead the US economy through the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and was widely referred to as an \"oracle\" and \"the maestro\".</p> <p>But Greenspan's super-low interest rates and consistent opposition to regulation of the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market are now widely blamed for causing the credit crisis. Under Greenspan's tenure the derivatives market went from barely registering to a $500 trillion industry, despite billionaire investor Warren Buffett warning that they were \"financial weapons of mass destruction\".</p> <p>His rock-bottom rates encouraged Americans to load up on debt to buy homes, even when they had no savings, no income and no job prospects.</p> <p>These so-called sub-prime borrowers were the cannon fodder for the biggest boom-bust in US history. The housing collapse brought the global economy to its knees.</p> <p>He was given an honorary knighthood in 2002 for his \"contribution to global economic stability\", but in 2008, at a Congressional hearing investigating the causes of the financial crisis, Greenspan finally admitted he \"made a mistake in presuming\" that financial firms could regulate themselves.</p> <p>\"You found that your view of the world, your ideology was not right, it was not working?\" Henry Waxman, the committee chairman, said.</p> <p>\"Absolutely, precisely,\" Greenspan replied. \"You know, that's precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.\"</p> <p>After he quit the Fed, in 2006, Greenspan joined Pimco, the world's largest bond investor, as a special consultant. Pimco's co-founder Bill Gross said Greenspan had helped make the firm \"billions of dollars'' in his role as a consultant.</p> <p>Gross said Greenspan's \"brilliance\" was a \"big money saver for us''. \"He's made and saved billions of dollars for Pimco already,'' Gross said in 2008.He has also advised Deutsche Bank and hedge fund billionaire John Paulson.</p> <p>Greenspan has also found time to criticise current Fed chairman Ben Bernanke's programme of quantitative easing. \"I've stayed away from commenting on Fed policy,\" he said on US TV earlier this month. \"I will say this, however, that the data do show that the expansion of assets has had very little impact on the economy, for an important reason, that we've created a major increase in the asset side of the Fed balance sheet and a very large trillion and a half increase in excess reserves.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967487331/Mervyn-King-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mervyn King\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mervyn King Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England</strong></p> <p>At his first meeting chairing the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) interest rates were cut to an historic postwar low of 3.5%.

If only that had been the case.</p> <p>He was slow to react to the crisis and initially refused to follow Greenspan in pumping cash into the system. The Treasury select committee (TSC) said he should have noticed that the housing bubble was becoming unstable and should have been \"more pro-active\" to damp it down.</p> <p>Just the other week King finally admitted that the financial crisis was the result of \"major mistakes\" by policymakers and not just the fault of greedy bankers.</p> <p>At the government's Global Investment Conference in London in the buildup to the Olympics he said: \"We saw this going into the crisis, we kept meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but we did nothing to solve it collectively, and I don't think that this was a problem that could have been solved individually.\"</p> <p>More recently, King had to face the TSC to explain why the Bank failed to spot the Libor interest rate-fixing scandal that pre-dated the credit crunch and last month Bob Diamond stepped down as chief executive of Barclays after King let it be known Diamond no longer had the confidence of the Bank.</p> <p>In the shake-up of regulation that followed the financial meltdown, the governor of the Bank of England has emerged with more power than ever. However, King is due to stand down next summer, with former cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell and deputy governor Paul Tucker the favourites to replace him.</p> <h2>Politicians</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394252633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Business competitions/pictures/2009/1/26/1232967669577/Bill-Clinton-001.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Bill Clinton, former US president</strong></p> <p>Politicians' current plan to help prevent another financial crisis is to ringfence banks' risky \"casino banking\" divisions from the more pedestrian high street banking departments. 13 years ago Clinton repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, which had done just that.

  "<p>The pupils file in quietly class by class, the school hall lit from the front with five candles on a table. Soft music plays in the background and images of the pupils taken at various times of the year appear as a slideshow. It is the last assembly of the academic year at Tower Hill primary in Witney, Oxfordshire, and an opportunity for staff and children to reflect on the last 12 months.</p> <p>Brandon comes forward and tells the school how he learned to curb his anger. He now counts to 10 if someone has made him cross. Annie says pupils tend not to tell lies&#xa0;any more or try to \"get out of\" something they have done wrong. Alana&#xa0;says she is proud of the moment she persevered with a difficult task in class when it might have been easier just to give up.</p> <p>This school is located in the heart of David Cameron's Witney constituency in west Oxfordshire, but its philosophy is some way removed from the culture of change and competition brought to the system by Cameron's government via its education secretary. \"Michael Gove would consider our approach far too ephemeral and touchy-feely,\" says Tracey Smith, the headteacher. \"But we would like him to visit us, and will be extending an invitation, so he can see what we're achieving here in a stable, happy environment. It might do his public image a lot of good if he did not appear so rigid in his thinking.\"</p> <p>Tower Hill is one of a growing number of schools in the UK that have adopted <a href=\"http://www.values-education.com/\" title=\"\">values-based education</a>, a fast-growing movement set up by a former Oxfordshire headteacher, Neil Hawkes. The ethos embraces qualities such as respect, courage, honesty, compassion and integrity among the school community, underpinned by high expectations. Its proponents believe that this ethical vocabulary, which is used and understood even by the youngest children, creates the ideal environment for learning by promoting a peaceful and calm atmosphere.</p> <p>Hawkes, whose movement has grown to include more than 2,000 schools throughout the UK, 49 of which have received its \"quality mark\", says values-based education is spreading largely by word of mouth as schools recognise its effectiveness. \"It empowers them to produce good results because it builds character. When children use the vocabulary of ethics they gain confidence and self-respect, and respect for others. Maths and physics have a vocabulary and so should ethics. These are innate qualities we have as human beings, which need to be developed like all skills do.\" Some areas of the country have large clusters of schools using this idea, he says, including south Wales, Herefordshire and Bedfordshire.</p> <p>Just one year after arriving at Tower Hill, Smith is achieving remarkable results. Overall, 85% of the latest cohort of year 6s has achieved the benchmark level 4 score in national curriculum tests in English and mathematics, a rise from 65% last year. Nobody would describe Witney as a disadvantaged area but this school does not mainly serve the affluent \"Chipping Norton set\" or their like. In this school more than 30% of children are entitled to free school meals, against a national average of 19.3% in primary schools and an Oxfordshire average of 9.8%. A&#xa0;third of pupils here have special needs.</p> <p>But for Smith primary education is not about passing tests, though student progress is tracked regularly. \"We don't teach to the tests because we don't need to \u2013 the majority of our pupils will pass them anyway because they learn what they need to know through our creative approach,\" she says.</p> <p>Her application for the headship dropped on the mat at Tower Hill at a time when the school was improving after a difficult few years of mediocre results and falling rolls. At her previous school, a Church of England primary, Smith had&#xa0;introduced values-based learning because she felt uncomfortable preaching about ethics in a religious context. \"Values are not exclusive to Christianity but something everyone should aspire to,\" she says.</p> <p>Liam Walsh, the chair of governors, says: \"We had a strong field of candidates, but Tracey's application and interview stood out. We had not explicitly been looking for a values-based approach, but implicitly it appears that this was what was needed. The simplicity of the idea really struck a chord.\"</p> <p>The school's motto, Be the Best You Can, applies not only to the work done in&#xa0;the classroom, but also in staff and pupils' behaviour and their relationships with each other. The sentiment behind it was noted by the prime minister himself when he visited the school at the end of term. \"I have seen a very confident headteacher and a very confident team doing great things in this school to raise its profile and results and to make sure pupils are getting the education they deserve,\" he said.</p> <p>Yet this school faces uncertain times. The day before term ended, Oxfordshire county council sent out a letter to all primary heads saying it would assist any schools choosing to convert to an academy and that it supported the government's programme. The idea does not sit comfortably with Smith, but she knows that Tower Hill will have to consider it, should other schools begin to go down that route.</p> <p>In a school that promotes stability and calm it is a potential upheaval and worry that Smith feels it can do without. \"We seek to create an environment where children feel happy, secure and can thrive because this is the very foundation of good&#xa0;learning, so this is an unwelcome distraction,\" she says.</p> <p>Although the wellbeing of pupils is no longer inspected as part of the Ofsted process, inspectors are expected to take account of children's spiritual, moral, social and cultural development. \"The first 'value' we introduced was respect, which was the theme for most of the first term,\" recalls Louise Conroy, the teacher who, with the head, has led the implementation of values-based learning. She recalls a football match when Tower Hill players approached the other team at the end of the game with outstretched hands, which their opponents refused to shake because of a disputed goal. \"We saw then that our pupils had understood the concept of respect very quickly.\"</p> <p>At lunchtimes a family scenario is created in the dining hall with pupils and teachers sitting in groups and serving each other. No one eats before everyone has their food. \"It teaches them manners and creates an environment that some may not get at home,\" Smith says.</p> <p>It has become accepted practice in the classroom for pupils to comment openly on each other's work, through a system of&#xa0;peer assessment, and for teachers to make suggestions for improvement. Previously many children would have felt threatened or criticised by such an approach, but an atmosphere of openness now pervades.</p> <p>Trust and self-esteem have grown as children reflect on their learning as well as their own behaviour and that of others, and every day is seen as an opportunity to start again and to get right things that had previously gone wrong.</p> <p>\"We hope that if nothing else these methods will enhance their life chances,\" Smith adds. \"If they go into a university or job interview and show good manners then that will help them. We want these children to have the same opportunities as everyone else.</p> <p>\"A child has to be happy to come to school and learn effectively, and we spent a lot of time talking to children about what they want to learn. This is something that Michael Gove seems to find hard to understand. It is as though he is trying to recreate grammar schools, even at primary level, but that is not the way to instil a love of learning in young children or to help them succeed.\"</p>",
  "<p>This year's Olympics have been a feat of human wonder, achievement and unity. But have you noticed something else while whiling away the hours in front of the box? The grooming.

Procter &amp; Gamble, which has set up a nail salon in the Olympic village, has provided many Team GB athletes with a patriotic nail art.</p> <p>In many cases, grooming has a twofold purpose for athletes. In her book Swimming Studies, <a href=\"http://leanneshapton.com/swimmingstudies.html\" title=\"\">Leanne Shapton</a> describes her childhood in training as a swimmer, in which female swimmers would shave one another's backs the night before a competition. \"Shaving is both psychological and practical. It does take the slightest layer of resistance off the exposed skin on backs, arms and legs, and it also scrapes some of the dead skin off, making it more sensitive in the water,\" Shapton explained. \"Swimmers can refer to their times as being done 'shaven' or 'unshaven'. I don't know if it has been scientifically proven, but I&#xa0;totally believe it helped.\"</p> <p>Grooming is as much about how it makes you feel as how it looks. But it seems to be at its most intense for the 2012 Games in part because physical upkeep is currently at its most culturally demanding across society as a whole. Social media means people are seen more than ever before. Add to that multi-channel TV, high-def and global broadcasting, and the pressure on athletes to look perfect reaches fever pitch. In a recent <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2181320/Olympics-2012-Team-USA-beach-volleyball-stars-getting-bodies-shape.html\" title=\"\">interview</a>, US volleyball player Kerri Walsh Jenning said: \"I hate getting waxed.

  "<p>Studying for a degree from one country while living in another is nothing new: Nelson Mandela famously took his University of London degree while imprisoned on Robben Island. But 2009-10 marked the first year in which more overseas students were studying for British degrees beyond these shores than within them. In January, a report from the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education revealed that there were now more than 200 overseas campuses dotted around the world. Of these, 25 are British: a figure that has doubled in just two years.</p> <p>It's a trend the universities minister, David Willetts, is keen to encourage. In a speech last June at Stanford University in the US he pointed to the surging demand for higher education in nations such as Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil, adding: \"I want to see investors from Britain and abroad helping our universities access these big overseas markets.\" But questions remain about whether financiers and universities are ready to work together \u2013 and about what form such ventures could take.</p> <p>By the time Willetts gave his speech, in fact, the wheels were already turning. In May, he convened a meeting with private firms, financial investors and vice-chancellors to discuss how to boost universities' overseas presence. And he launched UK Education Services (UKES), a new unit of the business department, with the intention of helping to sell British education suppliers to foreign governments.</p> <p>UKES won't just push overseas campuses: everything from technology to accreditation is also in its sights. But it could also market a sort of flat-pack higher education system, with campus construction, academic expertise and the finance to pay for it all in a single package. Governments in a hurry to create a new university could use Britain as a one-stop shop.</p> <p>Willetts's interest in all this is as much economic as educational. He sees higher education as \"one of our great export industries\", and wants to use its global reputation to boost the national coffers. Meanwhile, emerging economies increasingly want to educate their students at home, to reduce the risk of a brain drain. Overseas ventures will allow British universities to hang on to lucrative foreign income in the face of changing migration patterns \u2013 and unfriendly student visa policies in the UK.</p> <p>Some universities are already moving in this direction. This October, the University of Central Lancashire is launching UCLan Cyprus, the first UK university to set up shop on the island. It is planning UCLan Thailand and UCLan Sri Lanka, too. \"Within the next 10 years the face of education will change very significantly,\" says Professor Dave Phoenix, the pro-vice chancellor who has led the Cyprus project. \"There's a real opportunity for institutions that want to create a global brand.\"</p> <p>However, as big as the opportunity is, universities tend not to think in terms of business transactions. Consultant John Fielden has researched transnational education for organisations including Universities UK and the thinktank Million+. \"Most people assume universities [establish branch campuses] for money, but that's usually the wrong assumption,\" he says. In the case of newer universities, it's often a matter of \"securing a supply chain, getting students back to the UK in their third year and hoping they stay on\". For those higher up the league tables, it's about making a statement about their international reputation.</p> <p>As Professor Drummond Bone, the former Universities UK president who as Liverpool's vice-chancellor established its Chinese subsidiary, says: \"I think if you're looking at it in terms of short-term profitability, you're crazy, frankly.\"</p> <p>University bosses say the biggest barrier to getting international ventures off the ground is the lack of capital. Two investors \u2013 the Ontario Teachers' Pension Fund and investment bank Goldman Sachs \u2013 are keen, but so far neither has put its hand in its pocket, perhaps because of a lack of commercial expertise perceived in university management. And some universities aren't comfortable with the idea of teaming up with investment banks. Until that changes, foreign ventures are likely to remain relatively small, ad hoc affairs, funded largely through local investment.</p> <p>There is a third pitfall: governing bodies are a risk-averse lot, and an overseas venture that offered sub-par teaching could do a university's reputation more harm than good. And other risks are more tangible. In 2007, Australia's University of New South Wales opened a Singapore campus. It was meant to serve 15,000 students; actually, it attracted fewer than 150. It closed in a matter of weeks, leaving the university with a bill of over S$22m (\u00a311m).</p> <p>The result of all this is that full-blown campuses overseas are likely to remain a relative rarity. Fielden has just completed a report on transnational education for the UK Higher Education International Unit (IU). \"Nearly everyone is cooking up something,\" he says; but only a minority of institutions are planning branch campuses. The rest are looking instead to research partnerships or franchising arrangements: smaller, less risky ventures that require less money and management time. Others think the most likely outcome of the UKES will be \"education city\" projects of the sort seen in Malaysia's Educity Iskandar: campuses established by investors or overseas governments, into which British institutions can just slot a faculty or two. The IU's director, Joanna Newman, argues that success depends on working closely with existing local institutions: \"The old model of us supplying and them taking isn't going to work.\"</p> <p>If the government is serious about boosting higher education exports, there are other things it could do. One is to provide \"pump priming\" funding to get projects to the stage where investors might take an interest. It could also take on an active matchmaking role, Newman argues, citing a recent IU \"speed-dating\" event at which British and Brazilian universities could meet each other with a view to finding research partners.</p> <p>Even if the government does all this, though, not everyone in higher education will be jumping for joy. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the university thinktank Million+, argues that the entire debate is a distraction. \"This government's approach contrasts poorly against the previous one, which actually provided funding to boost higher education exports,\" she says. \"The Home Office visa restrictions are damaging one of the most successful UK export industries. No amount of private capital can compensate for that.\"</p> <p>If British universities don't fill the gap, though, those of other nations will. And the window of opportunity won't last for ever. Bone says that one of the reasons Liverpool went into China was to hang on to a group of students it otherwise expected to dwindle away. \"Ten, 15 years down the line, the attractions for developing countries of sending their young people to high-cost UK education is going to be a lot less, because of the development of their own systems,\" he says. By then, those countries will have built their own universities \u2013 and won't need to borrow ours.</p>",
  "<p>The second anniversary of the Browne report is fast approaching. Lord Browne promised a \"paradigm shift\" \u2013 towards the market, of course. What other Brave New World was/is available in these dog days of neoliberal triumph?</p> <p>But it's not working. Higher education has lost almost 10% of its \"market\" (student applications) \u2013 due partly to higher fees, partly to the diminishing prospects for graduates in a needlessly depressed economy. No real \"price\" competition has developed because all universities have decided to charge the maximum fee, or as close as makes no difference. Far from backing out of higher education, the state has piled in, micro-managing the controls on student numbers.</p> <p>What has gone wrong? One problem is&#xa0;the reluctance of politicians \u2013 whatever their ideological stripe \u2013 to roll back the state. Why should they be the exception to the rule that turkeys don't vote for Christmas? Another is that standards of policymaking and policy implementation, as opposed to think-tankery and spin, are now so low that all&#xa0;\"reforms\" are inevitably botched. A third is the internal contradiction between (high fee) Tories and (no fee) Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>But a more basic contradiction tends to get ignored \u2013 between the neoliberal worship of money as the only moral currency and the \"free\" market's debasement of old-fashioned sound money. There are examples everywhere.</p> <p>The best \u2013 and worst \u2013 is the billions, perhaps trillions, of dodgy derivatives that have come close to destroying the world's banks. Not content with speculating with real money, today's \"wealth creators\" invented phoney money \u2013 the only purpose of which was to act as global casino chips. Risk magically disappeared, except it didn't.</p> <p>The habit spread. Governments told voters they could have nearly all the public services they still wanted, but no longer had to pay for them through taxes, an easy (if cowardly) electoral sell.&#xa0;Individuals saw that saving, and investing in the future, were mug's games. Spend what you want \u2013 and borrow the difference.</p> <p>A second example is the private finance initiative (PFI) \u2013 and other cloned private-public \"partnerships\", which might more accurately be described as \"rip-offs\". The looming funding crisis in the NHS owes at least as much to these artificial and self-destructive schemes as to real-world causes such as more expensive drugs or&#xa0;an ageing population.</p> <p>The only reason PFI ever \"worked\" was the arbitrary rules about what counts as public expenditure. PFI schemes cost more to produce less \u2013 but they were off balance sheet in national accounts. These rules had been set by governments, central banks and other \"experts\" who were totally suffused by the neoliberal orthodoxies established in the 1980s and 1990s.</p> <p>A third example, sadly, is the government's higher education reform. The only reason it \"works\" is that the loans provided by the Student Loans Company do not count as public expenditure, while institutional grants from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) do. So would funding recouped through a graduate tax \u2013 which is why this was never a starter.</p> <p>Of course, in the real world, the old-fashioned world of sound money, there is no difference. Whether student loans or Hefce grants, the necessary resources have to be generated, through taxes or borrowing \u2013 and, having been spent on higher education, cannot be&#xa0;spent on anything else. But that reality has got lost in the smoke-and-mirrors world of 21st-century finance.</p> <p>So more is less. Real public funding on higher education will increase under the government's proposals, especially as up to 40% of graduates will never pay back their loans in full, at the time when \"headline\" public funding is cut dramatically. The only way out is to sell on the student loans book to the private sector \u2013 perhaps as opaquely packaged \"derivatives\" with a zero-risk state guarantee?</p> <p>Good news for universities perhaps: their fundamental problem is under-funding, regardless of source, compared with other countries. But a high cost will be paid \u2013 in terms of administrative disruption, betrayal of core values (treating a university education as a tradable commodity) and denial of social justice.</p> <p>There is another misconception, that&#xa0;the government's reforms will shift the burden of higher education from taxpayers to users (students and graduates). This is true only in the narrowest sense. Almost certainly successful graduates of the 1960s or 1970s have made a greater personal contribution to the cost of their higher education through the progressive tax system that once prevailed than graduates of this decade will ever contribute by (part) paying back their student loans.</p> <p>A paradigm shift, as Lord Browne claimed? Yes, in that the government's reform will disrupt, demoralise and politicise English higher education. No,&#xa0;in the sense that the \"market\" that has been created has more in common with dodgy derivatives and PFI schemes than a real-world sound-money market.</p> <p>\u2022 Peter Scott is professor of higher education studies at the Institute of Education</p>",
  "<p>We all know him: the popular guy at the party who schmoozes with everyone. He seems to have it all. Yet, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">\"popular guy\" is also the loneliest guy</a>. He has no true friends, no one in whom he can confide. It turns out that our character's social network is a mile wide, but only an inch deep.</p> <p>How is the 2012 election like the popular guy? Well, it turns out that the electoral college is fertile ground for this width v depth analogy. A candidate may win a great many states by a tiny margin and thus appear to have won a large victory even though he was actually quite close to being defeated: the mile-wide, inch-deep win.</p> <p>Jack Kennedy's <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1960&amp;off=0&amp;f=1\">1960 win</a> is a perfect example. He won 303 electoral votes or 56.4% of the available 537. That would imply an ample cushion of victory, but JFK would have fallen short of the necessary 50%+1 of electoral votes if the margin in each state had shifted by only 0.52 percentage points more toward Republican Richard Nixon.</p> <p>George W Bush's <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2004&amp;off=0&amp;f=1\">2004 victory</a> is a great example of the opposite scenario. He only won 286 electoral votes, or 53.2% of the available 538; and if Bush had lost Ohio, he would have lost the election. Yet, he won Ohio by the relatively comfortable margin of 2.1 percentage points. Bush's victory was therefore deeper than the raw number of electoral votes he won implied.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map_no_toss_ups.html\">electoral map</a> this year gives Democrats the jumping-joys and Republicans the willies. Newsweek/Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/04/michael-tomasky-on-the-possible-coming-obama-landslide.html\">puts it</a> best, as \"The (Possible) Coming Obama Landslide\". All polling aggregators give President Obama an edge over Mitt Romney in the electoral college. In fact, if the polling average of every state were correct, then as of today, Barack Obama would win 332 electoral votes, or 61.7% of the available 538.</p> <p>The question, though, is just how deep is Obama's lead? To know the answer, we have to have an idea of which states will decide the election.</p> <p>Most analysts would agree that the states with the great chance of being \"Florida 2000\" are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia. All were states won at least once by George W Bush, but were then carried in 2008 by Barack Obama. Obama leads in all of them currently. But how big are those leads?</p> <p>I've taken a median of the polling data for each state for all non-partisan polls since 1 June. I use the median to control for outlier polls and reference back to 1 June because most experts agree the race hasn't changed much since then. If a pollster has taken more than one poll in the state, I use the most recent data available.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394351901\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/8/6/1344272706399/Battlegroundmedians_220.jpg\" alt=\"Battleground state median polling\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Table: Harry Enten/guardiannews.com</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It turns out that Obama's leads are really not that deep. If the margin shifted a point and a half away from Obama in Florida, Iowa, and Virginia, he would be at 284 electoral votes, or 52.8%. Few would call that a \"blowout\".</p> <p>An Obama supporter might reason that it's no big deal if Obama loses a percentage point in Florida, because he'll still hold onto Iowa. Maybe, but states' presidential support tend to move in unison with each other. That's why <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100807112912im_/http://www.stat.columbia.edu/%7Ecook/movabletype/mlm/2000_2004.png\">uniform swings</a> referenced to changes in the national vote do a fine job of predicting changes in states' support. If Romney gains in Florida, he'll probably gain in Iowa and Virginia. Put another way, state-by-state presidential results are <a href=\"http://blogs.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/2012/08/05/an-electoral-landslide-for-obama/\"><em>not</em> independent of each other</a>.</p> <p>Thus the key state, according to the median poll data, is Ohio. If Obama wins Ohio, he will almost certainly win re-election. If Romney takes it, he is in very good position.</p> <p>Ohio seems, on the one hand, the perfect state for Mitt Romney. Romney's doing very well <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/08/obama-problem-white-working-class-americans\">nationally</a> with white working-class voters. In Ohio, 50% of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#OHP00p1\">2008 voters</a> were whites who lacked a college education \u2013 well above the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#USP00p1\">national demographic of 39%</a>.</p> <p>Yet, Romney's fallen back in Ohio. A one-time lead in a number of state polls has become a 3-point deficit in the median. The <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/241755-obama-takes-the-lead-in-critical-ohio\">auto industry</a> is recovering in the state; some <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105201/ohio-the-place-where-bain-might-be-paying\">might argue</a> that Ohio is a state where the Obama campaign's attacks on Romney's Bain Capital record seemed to be working.</p> <p>I'd point out, instead, that Romney simply hasn't consolidated the Republican base. As <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105511/obama-ohio-romney-polls\">Nate Cohn notes</a>, there is \"good reason to believe that Romney can make the jump to 46 or 47% without much difficulty, and that would effectively inaugurate a dead heat in the Buckeye State.\"</p> <p>The median poll in Ohio, which was a <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/06/obama-leads-romney-by-3-in-ohio.html#more\">Public Policy Polling survey</a> taken from mid June, illustrates this comeback potential well. Obama captured 83% of Democrats, but Romney only held 79% of Republicans. Merely bumping Romney up to an equal 83% support among Republicans cuts Obama's 3-point lead in the PPP poll in half. </p> <p>Whether Romney will actually do any of this catching-up, and win, is a different matter. It again comes down to a question of depth. Are those voters who are normally reachable for a Republican totally against Romney? Or are they just wary of him? If you can answer that question, you'll know whether Romney stands a chance in November.</p>",

  "<p>China's state-run media has lambasted the United States over its intervention in the South China Sea row, highlighting the alarming escalation of a long-running dispute.</p> <p>Furious commentaries ordered Washington to \"shut up\" and accused it of \"fanning the flames and provoking division\" in the region. The foreign ministry in Beijing called in a senior US diplomat at the weekend over the State Department comments.</p> <p>Analysts fear the South China Sea has become a major potential flashpoint, as tensions have risen sharply between China \u2013 which claims almost all the sea \u2013 and Vietnam and the Philippines. Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts of the sea, which contains valuable energy reserves and fisheries and sees an estimated $5 trillion of cargo \u2013 half the world's shipping tonnage \u2013 pass through its sea lanes annually.</p> <p>\"While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing,\" the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/asia/north-east-asia/china/229-stirring-up-the-south-china-sea-ii-regional-responses.aspx\" title=\"\">International Crisis Group warned</a> in a recent report on the six-party dispute.</p> <p>Beijing's most recent moves include offering oil and gas exploration blocks for bidding and establishing a new city, Sansha, which boasts at most a few thousand residents and 5 square miles (13 square kilometres) of land spread over several tiny islands \u2013 yet lays claim to 772,000 square miles (2 million square kilometres) of sea and its own military garrison.</p> <p>It prompted the US to publicly reenter the row, with a statement expressing concern at the growing tensions and singling out Beijing's role. The city and garrison \"run counter to collaborative diplomatic efforts to resolve differences and risk further escalating tensions in the region,\" said Patrick Ventrell, acting deputy spokesperson at the State Department.</p> <p>Beijing responded by calling in the US deputy chief of mission and state media ran a spate of hostile pieces. \"We are entirely entitled to shout at the United States, 'Shut up'. How can meddling by other countries be tolerated in matters that are within the scope of Chinese sovereignty?\" asked a commentary in the overseas edition of the People's Daily, the official Communist party newspaper.</p> <p>The domestic version accused Washington of \"fanning the flames and provoking division\" in the region.</p> <p>State media say Beijing's moves are a response to the actions of Manila and Hanoi, such as a new law requiring all foreign ships passing through the disputed waters to notify Vietnamese authorities.</p> <p>In Chinese eyes, it is \u2013 as deputy foreign minister Cui Tiankai recently described it \u2013 a \"victim\", not the instigator.</p> <p>Though its far smaller neighbours bristle at such a description, the new ICG report notes: \"China is not stoking tensions on its own. South East Asian claimants ... are now more forcefully defending their claims \u2013 and enlisting outside allies \u2013 with considerable energy.\"</p> <p>Shading the row is concern about the Obama administration's refocusing of foreign policy in a \"pivot to Asia\". The US says it has no territorial ambitions in the Sea and no position on the competing claims to land features, but has a national interest in freedom of navigation and maintaining peace and stability.</p> <p>But Chinese hawks warn of an attempt to encircle and contain China while others argue that, at a minimum, its rivals are exploiting the US shift.</p> <p>A Xinhua commentary this weekend accused the US of double-dealing and urged Washington to show it was not seeking \"to clip China's wings and shore up the United States' cracking pedestal in the Asia-Pacific\".</p> <p>In a speech quoted by the Global Times, Zhou Fangyin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences noted: \"Countries with territorial disputes with China believe that the costs and risks of provoking China have largely dropped ... China's rapid rise may also make [them] realize that their chances of reaping and consolidating benefits by encroaching upon Chinese territories would be smaller in the future.\"</p> <p>In any case, argues Rory Medcalf of Australia's Lowy Institute, \"It has become academic to ask who started it ... What we see now is an action-reaction cycle.\"</p> <p>The multitude of Chinese agencies involved has stoked tensions, the ICG has argued, with poor coordination and some actors seeing it as a way to increase their power and budget.</p> <p>Increasing militarisation of the dispute makes it harder to resolve skirmishes, but could also raise the threshold for armed conflict, it noted.</p> <p>\"More immediate conflict risks lie in the growing number of law enforcement and paramilitary vessels playing an increasing role in disputed territories without a clear legal framework\", it added.</p> <p>Domestic nationalism in other claimant countries adds to the difficulties.</p> <p>No one wants military conflict, not only because of the inevitable disruption of trade. The smaller countries would have to take on mighty China, while such a conflict \"would undermine [Beijing's] peaceful rise thesis, cause irreparable damage to its image and foreign policy in Asia and push other countries far closer to the US.</p> <p>Clearly none of that is in China's interests,\" said Ian Storey, of the Institute of South East Asian Studies in Singapore.</p> <p>Yet should it come to an exchange of fire, even the US could feel compelled to become involved \u2013 with great reluctance \u2013 to defend its credibility as an ally not only to the Philippines but countries across Asia, argued Medcalf.</p> <p>Analysts see little hope of resolving the dispute and say the best-case scenario is now the agreement of measures to handle clashes.</p> <p>\"I don't think any of the claimants have any good options. They have all painted themselves into a corner,\" said Storey.</p>",
  "<p>The cross-border <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/attack-across-egypt-israel-border?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">attack on Israel by militants</a> in the Egyptian Sinai was a highly ambitious and well-planned assault that has left Israeli authorities more certain than ever that the area is out of control \u2013 but also with a major dilemma over how to respond.</p> <p>A serious attack, potentially resulting in the deaths of many Israelis living in small communities near the border, was narrowly averted, according to senior officials.</p> <p>After killing about 15 Egyptian security personnel at a base in the border town of Rafah, the militants used a pickup truck filled with explosives to breach the Egypt-Israel border, then drove an armoured vehicle more than a mile into Israel before being struck by a missile fired from an Israeli military plane. Up to eight militants were killed.</p> <p>They were heavily armed and, significantly, were wearing suicide belts, thought to indicate a strong ideological motivation for the attack. A statement from the Egyptian military said 35 militants were involved and \"elements from the Gaza Strip\" aided the attack by firing rockets, suggesting co-ordination between Palestinian and Sinai militants.</p> <p>Israel's alarm at the mounting chaos and violence in Sinai has been growing steadily since their ally, the former president Hosni Mubarak, was ousted in the Egyptian revolution 18 months ago. As well as three serious cross-border attacks \u2013 one last August in which eight Israelis were killed, one in June in which an Israeli construction worker died and the one on Sunday evening \u2013 a pipeline supplying gas to Israel has been blown up more than a dozen times.</p> <p>The impoverished and neglected Sinai region has been a breeding ground for resentment and radicalism among its largely Bedouin inhabitants for years. But Israel says it now detects the presence of \"global jihad\" militants and groups, some loosely connected to al-Qaida.</p> <p>\"There is a problem with Bedouin tribes drifting towards a fundamentalist Islamic ideology, making themselves part of the Islamic jihad movement, by which I mean a loose network of small terror organisations trying to fight the current order,\" said Major General Dan Harel, former deputy chief of staff for the Israel Defence Forces.</p> <p>One of the difficulties Israel faces is intelligence-gathering across the border.</p> <p>\"Israel has a good hold on what's happening in Gaza\" as a result of close monitoring via aerial drones and human intelligence, said Yaakov Katz, a journalist specialising in defence and military affairs. \"Sinai is much more difficult.\"</p> <p>Even so, Israeli military intelligence had advance indication that an attack was imminent and responded swiftly when it was launched, thwarting an extremely serious incident, according to the defence minister, Ehud Barak. In Gaza, such intelligence would have resulted in a pre-emptive strike on a militant cell planning an attack \u2013 an option simply not available across the Egyptian border.</p> <p>Assuming that Israel shared its intelligence with its Egyptian counterparts, the Israeli military distrusts its neighbour's willingness to take effective action to rein in militants in Sinai and exert a grip on the area. That may now change.</p> <p>\"I hope this will be a wake-up call for Egypt regarding the necessity to be sharp and efficient on their side,\" said Barak while touring the site of the attack on Monday morning.</p> <p>Cairo cannot afford to ignore the loss of more than a dozen Egyptian soldiers. According to Katz, Mohammed Morsi, the new Muslim Brotherhood president of Egypt, \"is going to have to deal with this. Up until now he could pretend this wasn't a big problem. But this could be a turning point. Is [the government] going to take control or allow [the region] to remain a safe haven for al-Qaida and global jihad types?\"</p> <p>And, indeed, within hours of the attack, Morsi was pledging to \"impose full control\" on Sinai, later sending helicopter gunships to join a security sweep of the area.</p> <p>Israel, however, does not like to outsource its security \u2013 and does not usually shy away from taking action on foreign territory to protect its citizens and interests.</p> <p>But this is a delicate situation. Since Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979, Sinai has been a demilitarised zone, with tight restrictions on troops on the ground. Israel is unlikely to take steps which could threaten the treaty's durability, especially in the context of its concerns over the post-revolution government's commitment to the accord.</p> <p>\"Israel has strategic interests in keeping the peace treaty. This is why we're not attacking on Egyptian soil and instead conveying alerts we have to the Egyptian authorities in the hope they will deal with it,\" Harel said.</p> <p>The repercussions of Israeli action across the border would be significant, Katz said.</p> <p>\"The end of the peace treaty, demonstrations throughout Egypt, our ambassador being kicked out of Cairo? Israel's ability to respond is very limited.\"</p> <p>After Israeli forces shot dead five Egyptian security personnel on Egyptian soil after last August's cross-border attack, anti-Israel sentiment rose markedly and the Israeli embassy in Cairo came under violent attack.</p> <p>But some are urging a robust response. According to Alex Fishman, the defence analyst for Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, the time for direct action is drawing closer.</p> <p>\"The political leadership in Israel&#xa0;\u2026 is being respectful of Egyptian honour, afraid to sneeze next to them or demand, heaven forbid, that they do anything,\" he wrote. \"There will be no choice: Israel is approaching the point at which it will have to deal with Sinai on its own, with everything this entails, including how it will affect the relationship with Egypt. Otherwise there will be a bloodbath here in a style we have not seen before.\"</p>",

It's his tank,\" says Daossa Mohammed, the perennially cheerful editor of Iriba's Radio Absoun. \"It's been there for 22 years as a reminder to the population not to go to war.\"</p> <p>On 20 July, the international court of justice ordered that Senegal should immediately organise a trial of Habr\u00e9, who is accused of a catalogue of human rights abuses during his eight years in power in Chad, or extradite him to Belgium for trial.</p> <p>Another journalist pipes up from the back seat, \"People are no longer interested in Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9. We need to move on. It's old news.\" \"You mustn't say that!\" shouts Daossa, the smile falling abruptly from his face. \"He killed thousands of people. He threw people in boiling water and banished families from this very land. Chadians deserve justice!\"</p> <p>It's a powerful indication of how polarised reactions to attempts to bring Habr\u00e9 to justice can be; between the older generation who lived through the terror (Habr\u00e9 was said to have had an underground swimming pool in which the DDS, his secret police, tormented victims), and younger people who see Habr\u00e9's alleged crimes as from another place and time \u2013 a Chad from the history books.</p> <p>Many young people have never known a time when Habr\u00e9 was in Chad \u2013 he fled the country shortly after Idriss D\u00e9by's forces progressed westwards from Iriba, and eventually sought refuge in Senegal. Many of his victims have since left the country, and 22 years later others are now elderly or have died.</p> <p>On the day of the international court judgment, not one Chadian in the restaurant I was sitting in looked up when the news story with images of Habr\u00e9 was on television. Later in the day, I chatted to young people around town and the comment that stuck most in my mind was: \"Yes, Chadians want justice, but this has gone on so long now we won't believe it until we see it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394262493\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/8/3/1344011023959/MDG--Tank-said-to-belong--008.jpg\" alt=\"MDG : Tank said to belong to former Chad dictator Hissene Habre \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A tank said to belong to Habr\u00e9. Photograph: Celeste Hicks</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celeste Hicks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But for those who suffered at the hands of the notorious DDS, the judgment is an important step on the road to justice. Victims have been supported by organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/legacy/english/docs/2005/09/30/chad11786_txt.htm\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>, which obtained papers showing that more than 1,000 people were killed in detention and thousands of others were tortured during Habr\u00e9's rule.</p> <p>\"Today, my friends who were tortured, the people I saw die in jail, those who never gave up hope, are one step closer to achieving justice,\" says Souleymane Guengueng, who almost died in prison when Habr\u00e9 was in power, and founded an association to help victims.</p> <p>So what is the priority for Chad? Is it more important to face the past head-on or should Chadians put the dark days of the 1980s behind them?</p> <p>\"Habr\u00e9's crimes have caused deep wounds in Chadian society \u2013 people look at each other like dogs with their teeth bared,\" says Emmanuel N'Dalbaye, a sociology lecturer at the University of N'Djamena. \"They say they forgive each other but then everyone is scared of everyone else. We are a tolerant country, but without justice Chad will never move away from the ethnic and religious division that it suffers from today.\"</p> <p>The Habr\u00e9 case has presented unique challenges for international justice. The former dictator has been living in exile in Senegal for 21 years, but efforts to prosecute him have faltered. Former Senegalese president <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20110711-justice-hissene-habre-african-legal-soap-opera-chad-senegal\" title=\"\">Abdoulaye Wade made several unfulfilled pledges to put him on trial</a>, and at one point demanded that international donors should pay for the establishment of a special court there.</p> <p>Frustrated with the lack of progress, lawyers representing Habr\u00e9's surviving victims went to Belgium, which has international jurisdiction, and asked them to try the former president. Hopes had been riding high that last week's judgment would effectively force Senegal to hand him over to Belgium.</p> <p>But there is a glimmer of hope that, with the recent peaceful handover of power in Senegal to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/mar/26/senegal-votes-new-president-sall\" title=\"\">Macky Sall</a>, there may be a window of opportunity for progress.</p> <p>\"The Senegalese government appears to be committed to trying Habr\u00e9 and has taken steps in that direction,\" says Clement Abaifouta, the N'Djamena-based representative of the association for the victims of the crimes of Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9. \"However, we've been disappointed and betrayed before by Senegal so we will remain vigilant until we see Habr\u00e9 in that courtroom.\"</p>",

Hence the outrage in Turkey over this photograph, released by the White House last week, which shows Obama in the Oval Office, talking to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, while fiddling a souvenir bat signed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Aaron\">Hank Aaron</a>.</p> <p>\"The photo reveals from whom our prime minister receives orders to rule the country,\" said one Turkish opposition politician, Metin Lufti Baydar, cannily spotting a PR opportunity, though <a href=\"http://english.ruvr.ru/2012_08_06/Obama-and-his-baseball-bat-speak-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick/\">my favourite take on the matter</a> comes from a columnist for Russia's government-sponsored world service media:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Had he been dressed in a tracksuit and tennis shoes, perhaps we could have been convinced of Obama's sporting virtues and love of sports, yet the photograph shows Obama in his official uniform, complete with jacket and tie, as he very demonstrably holds a baseball bat with a white-knuckle grip \u2026 the White House knows exactly what it is doing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This seems, shall we say, relatively unlikely, not least because deliberately sparking a row with Turkey right now would be crazy, given its centrality to addressing the situation in Syria. (The White House was <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/picture-obama-holding-baseball-bat-angers-turkish-political-circles-article-1.1129098\">troubled enough to issue a statement denying any such inference</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/turkeys-leader-dismisses-opposition-criticism-of-obama-holding-baseball-bat-during-phone-call/2012/08/05/0b35d72a-df23-11e1-8d48-2b1243f34c85_story.html\">Erdogan has now added his voice</a>, calling Obama \"a friend who never falls short of respect or politeness\".)</p> <p>Perhaps there's also an issue of cross-cultural symbolism here. In America, a baseball bat can connote violence, but primarily, it connotes a beloved national pastime in which sportsmen and spectators gather in stadiums across the country to eat snacks. On the other side of the ocean, the connotation is mainly just the former.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394337659\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/8/6/1344269154864/obamaapples_220.jpg\" alt=\"President Obama and Vice-president Biden in the Oval Office, with apples\" width=\"220\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Obama and Vice-president Biden in the Oval Office, with apples, 31 July 2012.

  "<p>Banks and mining groups led the way as leading shares hit a three month high.</p> <p>The rise would have been even higher if not for a last minute reversal - a substantial one - in <strong>Standard Chartered</strong>. The bank's shares slumped more than 6% to \u00a314.70 as the market closed, following reports the New York state regulator had filed an enforcement order relating to an alleged $250bn of unauthorised transactions with Iran.</p> <p>On the whole, although volumes were light, investors were encouraged by hopes of progress in the eurozone crisis. Comments from Spain seemed to suggest the country may be willing to seek a bailout, although no countries have as yet apparently asked for help from the EU funds. Reports from Greece that inspectors from the troika - the European Central Bank, IMF and European Union - had made positive noises about the country's budget measures also helped sentiment, as did indications from China of possible action to boost the country's economy.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 21.49 points higher at 5808.77, having earlier reached 5837.</p> <p>Other banks did better than Standard Chartered, the biggest faller in the index. <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> led the risers, up 12.8p at 228.8p after weekend speculation that its US business Citizens could attract bids of up to \u00a310bn. There was also the optimism over the eurozone, which lifted <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> 0.75p to 31.36p and <strong>Barclays</strong> 5.85p to 177.2p.</p> <p><strong>Evraz</strong>, the steelmaker part owned by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovitch, added 11.4p to 251p after UBS removed the company from its least preferred list following recent share price falls. Miners benefited from growth hopes, with <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> up 14.9p at 403.1p.</p> <p>There was even a burst of takeover talk, with <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> climbing 6.6p to 347.7p after <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9452750/Banks-see-MandS-as-bid-target-after-shares-fall.html\" title=\"\">weekend reports</a> that bankers were lining it up as a \u00a36bn bid target after its recent falls. Analyst Clive Black at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> That M&amp;S has made no comment on these stories as yet implies that the company's board has nothing to consider as yet to our minds; we would imagine that the regulatory authorities will be keeping a watch on matters. Whether there are M&amp;S files being dusted off by inactive and bored bankers on the one hand and financial buyers on the other; well who knows? That said, we doubt that the stories are total flights of fancy or fiction. </blockquote> <p><strong>Burberry</strong> was 25p better at \u00a313.30. Hints from the Chinese central bank that it may act to boost its economy helped luxury goods groups, which see the area as important for their future growth.</p> <p>Burberry was also helped by Richemont, the maker of Cartier jewellery, reporting strong growth, especially in emerging markets.</p> <p>But <strong>Centrica</strong> closed 2.9p lower at 320.6p and <strong>SSE</strong> slipped 13p to \u00a313.15 after Deutsche Bank cut its ratings on both from buy to hold. Analyst Martin Brough said:</p> <blockquote> The expected UK energy market transformation is well underway, but political consensus on energy policy is breaking down. Weakness in global commodity prices makes upstream investments look less valuable, and we cut [our recommendation on] Centrica and SSE. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Telecity</strong> climbed 39p to 877.5p after the data centre operator unveiled a 26.6% rise in half year earnings to \u00a362.6m. and bought its first operation in Finland. The Helsinki-based Tenue, bought for \u00a33.7m, will give Telecity capacity at an important crossroads for growing traffic between Russia and western Europe. Jonathan Imiah at Canaccord Genuity kept his hold recommendation but raised his target price from 700p to 735p:</p> <blockquote> These are yet another strong set of results from Telecity, particularly in the context of a substantial weakening in the euro over the past few months. The entrance into the key Finnish market \u2013 a bridgehead for Scandinavia (adding to the group's existing asset in Stockholm), Russia and Eastern Europe \u2013 makes clear strategic and financial sense. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Heritage Oil</strong>, suspended in July at 123p when it announced an $850m deal to buy a major stake in Nigeria's OML 30 and a $370m rights issue to help pay for the purchase, narrowed its half year losses from $6.9m to $6.7m.</p> <p>Marketing services group <strong>Creston</strong> climbed nearly 8% - up 5.63p to 75.625p - following news after the market closed on Friday that French advertising giant Havas had declared a 5.18% stake. Johnathan Barrett at Singer Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> Unless there is clarity to the contrary there is likely to be bid speculation. In general, larger agencies are significantly more highly rated than smaller peers and therefore acquisitions would be prima facie accretive. The marketing services sector is in good health, despite tough [macroeconomic environment], and larger groups are looking to invest cash flow in acquisitions. Creston [is] both cheap and likely to be subject to approaches unless its valuation rises to reflect the fundamentals of its attractive assets, client list and health unit. </blockquote> <p>Finally, just days after struggling retailer <strong>HMV</strong> announced the departure of Simon Fox as chief executive, came news the finance director was following him out of the door.</p> <p>Responding to weekend reports, the company said David Wolffe had indicated his intention to leave, but would stay until a successor had been found. The news sent the company's shares down 3.5% to 3.5p.</p>",
  "<p>Streaming radio service <a href=\"http://tunein.com/\">TuneIn</a> has raised $16m (\u00a310.2m) in its latest round of funding, while announcing that it now has more than 40m monthly active listeners.</p> <p>The service, which is available as a website, mobile apps and through connected hi-fis and TVs, helps people stream more than 70,000 radio stations, while also providing on-demand shows and podcasts.</p> <p>Its success comes alongside similar growth for personal radio service Pandora, which had 54.5m active listeners <a href=\"http://blog.pandora.com/archives/press/2012/07/pandora_announc_13.html\">at the end of June 2012</a>, all in the US. TuneIn's audience is global: the company says it has listeners in 230 countries and territories, and stations from 206.</p> <p>The company's latest funding round was led by venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners, with Jafco Ventures, Google Ventures and Sequoia Capital all chipping in.</p> <p>The round follows $6m raised in 2010, bringing its total to $22m. Chief executive John Donham said in a statement that it will be spent hiring new staff and investing in product development and marketing.</p> <p>TuneIn's mobile apps have been the key driver of its growth. The company says that its number of mobile listeners increased by 267% in the last year, with the amount of mobile \"listening hours\" increasing by 348% in the same period. TuneIn hasn't revealed specific numbers for either metric.</p> <p>The company is also benefiting from the fact that it's not a competitor for traditional radio stations like Pandora, but a supporter and potential partner. It has deals with radio broadcasting groups including CBS, NPR and Entercom.</p> <p>TuneIn is hoping to help stations keep their audiences as those listeners switch to streaming as their preferred way to access radio. As Donham <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/jan/05/tunein-radio-apps-social-cars\">told The Guardian</a> in January 2012: \"DJs still play tastemakers. The place that people are still discovering the majority of their music is the radio: this person that's there and hand-selecting pieces of content.\"</p> <p>Besides Pandora, TuneIn's key competitor in the US is iHeartRadio, the service belonging to Clear Channel, which offers a streaming combination of traditional stations and Pandora-style personalised channels.</p> <p>iHeartRadio had more than 45m unique users in April 2012, with 10m of them registered to use its personal channels. Also in the US radio mix is Spotify, whose own personal radio feature is available in a free version of its iOS and Android apps in the US.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland faces the loss of some of its most vulnerable bird species and habitats after ministers cut environment spending on farmland by \u00a325m, a senior conservationist has warned.</p> <p>Stuart Housden, the Scottish director of the RSPB, said ministers in Edinburgh were risking legal action by the EU after \"raiding\" the budget which was intended to conserve corncrakes, rare orchids, peatbogs and flower meadows in the face of modern farming techniques, climate change and habitat loss.</p> <p>Despite the heavy emphasis that Alex Salmond's government has put on promoting Scotland's wilderness and iconic species like the golden eagle, Housden said Scotland already had the EU's lowest level of spending on the so-called <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/farmingrural/Agriculture/Environment/Agrienvironment\" title=\"\">agri-environment schemes</a> \u2013 that encourage farmers to manage their land to benefit wildlife \u2013 before the latest cuts.</p> <p>His comments came after the Scottish government disclosed to the Guardian that for the next three years spending on agri-environment projects will fall in total by \u00a325m, dropping from \u00a347m last year to \u00a340m this year and then to \u00a338m in 2013 and 2014.</p> <p>Those reductions are in addition to parallel cuts of \u00a316.1m for the conservation agency Scottish Natural Heritage, prompting fears among environmentalists that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2012/apr/05/scotland-wildlife\" title=\"\">losing more than \u00a340m in environment protection</a> would cause significant damage to their efforts to adapt to climate change, and to protect threatened species.</p> <p>Housden said the decision by Richard Lochhead, the Scottish environment secretary, to cut agri-environment spending in favour of protecting direct subsidies to farmers, put the UK at risk of breaching its obligations under European conservation directives.</p> <p>The cuts would also damage efforts to adapt to climate change \u2013 agri-environment schemes helped farmers preserve unproductive bogs and wetlands, which played a key role in flood prevention and as carbon sinks.</p> <p>Recent official studies on the health of Scotland's sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) \u2013 legally protected places with rare, vulnerable or significant species and habitats \u2013 had found that only 78% are in favourable condition.</p> <p>EU environment directives require member states to preserve and improve SSSIs by getting 95% to favourable condition. Some expert studies suggested Scotland needed to spend \u00a3250m a year to meet its obligations. Housden said the funding cuts meant that task would be made even harder.</p> <p>Scottish government papers confirmed that surviving agri-environment grants would be made harder to apply for, to cut costs. Future planning by farmers who supported the schemes was also being held up by delays in the EU to agree future funding.</p> <p>By contrast, UK environment ministers had protected agri-environment spending in England, and were looking for a thousand more farmers to apply for grants. Successive Scottish governments had refused to compel land owners and farmers to protect sensitive sites, but cutting grants made it far harder to persuade farmers to spend time and money voluntarily conserving threatened species and habitats.</p> <p>\"Scotland's fantastic wildlife and landscapes have to be protected and this requires investment, and a fall in investment will inevitably lead to decline in biodiversity and key species,\" Housden said. \"This will be a loss to us all. The government has to get these policies firmly embedded in its future actions and policies.\"</p> <p>The Scottish government insisted it was trying to preserve future funding while wrestling with deep cuts in UK government funding, and said this year's pot of money was not yet fully spent.</p> <p>\"We recognise the importance of agri-environment funding to Scotland and are confident that there is sufficient funding to meet demand, despite the tough financial settlement imposed on Scotland by the UK government,\" a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>\"We understand concerns about uncertainty surrounding future funding and are investigating options available when this year's funding round concludes, including asking the European commission to clarify whether we can continue offering contracts. We will continue to press the commission for a clear steer and will give guidance as soon as it clarifies its position.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Dutch judoka who tackled the man after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/bottle-thrown-olympic-100m-final\" title=\"\">he hurled a plastic bottle on to the track seconds before the 100m final</a> was about to begin said today she intervened because he dishonoured Olympic sport.</p> <p>Edith Bosch, who won a bronze medal in the 70kg category, found herself at the centre of a global story when a man began causing a commotion near to her trackside seat for the Olympic final and hurled a green plastic beer bottle that bounced across the track.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of commotion. I was just there to watch a fantastic event. I'm an athlete and a person who loves sports. Somebody came around who was having behaviour problems and was disrespectful in a big way. I did what any other person would have done and corrected it. I said 'Man, you're crazy. What are you doing?',\" she said.</p> <p>\"It's because we are here for Olympic heroes, people performing on the highest level and we have to honour them and not disrespect them. I pushed him away hard and said, 'Dude, what are you doing, are you crazy?' That's what I did.\"</p> <p>Bosch said the worst thing about the incident was that she missed the 100m final in the commotion. \"This is just one thing and now it's big. The other 80,000 people were cheering for the athletes and that's the most important thing,\" said Bosch. \"The worst thing is that due to all the commotion and this guy I missed out on the 100m. I could ask Usain Bolt to run it again but I don't think he's going to do that.\" She said she hoped someone would give her a ticket for the 200m so she could see Bolt run.</p> <p>The man was charged with a public order offence following the incident, which was seen by 20 million viewers watching in the UK and hundreds of millions more around the world.</p> <p>Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, from South Millford, near Leeds, will appear in custody at Stratford magistrates court on Monday afternoon. A police spokesman said he will be charged with intending to cause intentional harassment, alarm or distress.</p> <p>Gill-Webb was arrested after the incident on Sunday night at the Olympic Stadium. He is reportedly a father of two and a member of a local football team in South Millford. A police spokesman said a man had been heard shouting abuse and was seen throwing a bottle, which landed behind the sprinters just after the starter told them to \"set\".</p> <p>The London 2012 organising committee chairman Lord Coe said this morning that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/06/coe-olympic-bottle-thrower-justice\" title=\"\">there was \"poetic justice\" in the fact that Bosch happened to be sitting near the man who threw the bottle</a>. \"Throwing a bottle on to the field of play is unacceptable, not just at the Olympic Games but any sports venue. The guy was removed and anyone who does that in future will be removed. There is zero tolerance,\" he said. \"I'm not suggesting vigilantism but it is poetic justice they happened to be sitting next to a judo player.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US is helping the Philippines to modernise and improve its military capability in the face of a growing confrontation with China over supremacy in the South China Sea.</p> <p>The Americans have already agreed to transfer two naval vessels to an underpowered Philippine navy, and deployment of fighter jets, a coastal radar system and even increased numbers of American troops on the ground in the Philippines are under discussion.</p> <p>The Philippines has several territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea, and while all sides know its armed forces will never be a match for China, the military moves are designed to give the country a \"minimum credible defence position\", officials say.</p> <p>The US has transferred to its Pacific ally two decommissioned coastguard ships. The first, the Gregorio del Pilar, arrived August 2011 and replaced a second world war vessel as the Philippine navy's biggest and newest ship. The second is expected to arrive this year.</p> <p>Officials familiar with defence and security policy have told the Guardian this may be the beginning of an era of greater military co-operation. Rodolfo Biazon, chair of the Philippine house committee on national defence, told the Guardian there were plans to buy \"big-ticket items for the air force and navy\".</p> <p>Lieutenant Colonel Miko Okol, spokesman for the Philippine air force, says surface attack aircraft, attack helicopters, long-range patrol aircraft and radar are among the items already approved for purchase and soon to be put up for bid. He says, \"I cannot give you a specific, like a specific aircraft, or what country we're gonna get them from. But these are the things we will be getting in the next two or three years.\"</p> <p>A request for a squadron of F-16 aircraft has been made to US defence officials, but Okol is unsure of where it will lead: \"We have told officials we would like to get these items as part of the things we might ask them [for] in terms of our defence co-operation with them\".</p> <p>The Philippines may also receive help in upgrading its military equipment from US allies such as Japan, South Korea and Australia. Ricky Carandang, the presidential communications secretary, says that talks are being held with Japan to acquire 12 patrol boats for the coastguard. The US is also understood to be considering increasing its troop presence from current levels of around 600.</p> <p>The developments come as the scramble intensifies for control of the South China Sea, a crucial expanse of ocean with coastline in China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.</p> <p>China has been asserting its military power in recent years, claiming territorial rights over Scarborough Shoal and other island groupings deep in the 200-mile maritime exclusion. Smaller regional powers have felt cowed in the face of a superpower flexing its muscles, and are turning to the other global superpower for support.</p> <p>But Carandang says territorial issues are not the main reason for the drive to upgrade military capability. \"If you look at our configurations, there is always a focus on primarily fighting internal threats since the late Marcos era,\" he explains. \"Basically, we have allowed our external defence capabilities to deteriorate. Whether or not there was an issue with China, there was that need and the president recognised it.\"</p> <p>Prof Rommel Banlaoi, vice president of the Philippine Association for Chinese Studies, mentions the other threats which would be reasons for the country to build up its maritime domain: \"It can also mean against other international terrorist groups, maritime pirates, smugglers of arms, drug smugglers, human traffickers, and other forms of transnational organised crimes using the South China Sea, the Celebes Sea, the Sulu Sea.\"</p> <p>But Banlaoi says access to the sea lanes in the South China Sea is also an issue. Although the US says it does not take a position on competing territorial claims, it does have an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation in the area for American ships, whether military, civilian or commercial.</p> <p>\"In my opinion the US is doing this because of the China challenge,\" says Banlaoi. \"Of course it will not admit it \u2013 the US also has interests in keeping a cordial relationship with China as an economic power. The US fears that if China increases its influence in the area then it will affect the unhampered use of the waters in the South China Sea.\"</p> <p>According to Banlaoi, the support given to America's former colony is part of President Obama's \"pivot towards Asia\" is an attempt to strengthen all its existing alliances in Asia- including Australia, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.</p> <p>Banlaoi says that the Philippines needs the assistance most: \"Among American allies in Asia the Philippines is the only country with no credible capabilities. We are very ill equipped, in fact the Philippines is what I call belonging to the weakest link in the US alliances in Asia.\"</p> <p>The United States is also assisting the Philippines with a system to better monitor the archipelago's Western coast. Details as to the timeframe of such a project are unclear but according to Carandang, \"It's going on ..its moving, it's happening.\"</p> <p>Rep. Biazon details the form such assistance might come in: \"You need not only the radar systems, but including communication systems. You can't operate the aircraft without a radar. That will be part of the package. And probably even armaments.\"</p> <p>But debate exists as to whether or not these efforts to modernize the military with new equipment will really make a difference.</p> <p>Neri Colmenares, party list representative for the leftist Bayan Muna movement, believes efforts to make Philippines defence \"credible\" are in vain and will only serve to increase dependence on the US: \"We can spent a hundred years' budget on the armed forces of the Philippines and it will not make our defence credible against China,\" he says. \"An increase in budget or capabilities is not the way forward&#xa0;\u2026 because the armed forces itself has not been reformed. It's still a corrupt and politicised body.\"</p> <p>Academics such as professor Benito Lim, a China specialist who teaches political science at Ateneo de Manila University, questions the sincerity of American help, pointing out that China's defence system is stronger than all the military weaponry of the Asean countries combined.</p> <p>Referring to the Gregorio del Pilar, which was stripped of most of its weapons, he says: \"Suppose the Americans know that China owns a machine gun, but they give the Philippines a kitchen knife \u2013 it makes the Philippines look ridiculous when confronted with the Chinese in the Scarborough Shoal.</p> <p>\"Suppose they see Chinese ships enter the area of the contested islands. What can the Philippines do? Can they drive them out? They will probably just to do what they are doing now \u2013 say 'The Chinese are bullying us!'\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Read Emily and Olivia's summing up and Storify of Day One <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/05/olympics-sheffield-jessica-jess-ennis\">here.</a></strong></p> <p>As the sun sets over the Don Valley Complex on Sunday evening, Sheffield can certainly be proud of its brand new festival prot\u00e9g\u00e9. </p> <p>With a total of 20,000 people singing, dancing, eating and drinking their way through the festival weekend, <a href=\"http://www.sheftival.com/\">Sheftival</a> can safely say it's made it's mark on the South Yorkshire festival scene.</p> <p>After a rip-roaring start on Saturday, with the likes of Ryan O'Shaughnessy, Laura Steel and Toots &amp; The Maytals gracing the stages, Sunday was a quieter affair. But the sense of camaraderie and sunshine and Yorkshire's Olympic glory (7th in the medal table, were we an independent country) ensured that the excitement and enthusiasm was carried over to the festival's final day. </p> <p>After Sheffield's Jessica Ennis sealed that well-deserved heptathlon gold with her performance in the 800m race on Saturday night, it was difficult to envisage how the same level of Olympic excitement could be fostered for the festival's second day. But, GB tennis star Andy Murray wowed the crowds once more by beating Wimbledon champion Roger Federer in straight sets, He may be a Scot, but everyone was glued to the screen at the Don Valley stadium. </p> <p>And the athletes weren't the only ones working hard this weekend, as hundreds of children tried out twenty-five different sports at Ennis' home training ground. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorbing\">Zorbing </a>was one of them, allowing intrepid participants to launch themselves downhill in a giant plastic orb (rather you than us). Those less adventurous could opt for a game of football. But they'd have to deal with playing on an inflatable pitch\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394246139\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344260812676/SarahMac.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Mac at Sheftival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Mac on the Buskers Barge. Fine hat and it didn't matter about the keyboard stand...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Festival Director Dave Healy said</p> <blockquote> <p>What made Sheftival unique was the combination of sport and music. The participation in sport has been a real success, who know, maybe we have just inspired the next Jess Ennis.</p> </blockquote> <p>All the while, everyone taking part in sports was racking up stamps on their Sheftival Activities Passport, competing for Browse, Silver or Gold prizes. After the exercise, it was time for a culinary re-charge, and Sheftival wasn't about to disappoint. Hungry punters filled their bellies with treats from across the globe; sampling cuisine from dozens of stalls set up throughout the complex, from stone-baked pizzas to a mouth-watering Jamaican Jerk BBQ tent. Not to mention Ostrich Burgers and Curried Goat-yum. </p> <p>Another contributor to the festival's identity was the unmistakable cartoon branding on tickets, posters and t-shirts across the city. This was all thanks to local design company <a href=\"http://www.peterandpaul.co.uk/\">Peter and Paul</a> (no nursery rhyme jokes, please). They were most recently responsible for design work on Kid Acne's 'South Yorks', Toddla T's merch and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/24/tramslines-festival-sheffield-music\">Tramlines Music Festival</a>. Their work made Sheftival instantly recognisable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394246140\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344260892315/Poster.jpg\" alt=\"Sheftival poster\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But Sunday's big highlight was the Dodgy secret gig on the 'Buskers Barge', treating passengers to an hour of nostalgic '90s hits down the canal, such as 'Good Enough' and 'Staying Out For The Summer.' Opening for the band was local solo artist Sarah Mac. With an air of modesty, she confessed with a meek smile and soft Sheffield twang, to having forgotten her keyboard stand. At which point the furry-hatted songstress launched into her first ballad, singing and playing piano with the depth and maturity of someone who's been in the biz for decades. </p> <p>As they came off, people were instantly drawn to the Jetty Side Stage, to hear an entire brass band playing Human League's 'Don't You Want Me'. Only in Sheffield. </p> <p>The sounds of reggae and ska dominated the musical side of the festival complimenting its relaxed atmosphere and family-friendly environment. And Kanda Bonga Man, Macka B and The Beat took to the stage on Sunday to deliver just that. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394246141\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/6/1344260952138/barge.jpg\" alt=\"Dodgy at Sheftival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dodgy on the barge - '90s nostalgia along the cut</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other local acts were The Crookes, who performed a late night session on the Buskers Barge with See Emily Play and In Fear of Olive. </p> <p>And finally, Brit pop act Lightning Seeds brought Sheftival to a crescendo of a close.

  "<p>Tens of thousands of jobseekers have had their benefits stripped unlawfully and are likely to be entitled to a rebate following a high court ruling on Monday, lawyers have said.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/aug/06/unpaid-work-scheme-ruled-lawful-poundland\" title=\"\">judicial review</a>, claims by two jobseekers that the government's back-to-work schemes amounted to \"forced labour\" were rejected. They also failed to persuade a judge that the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) had failed to publish enough official information about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/feb/22/unemployment-work-programme-welfare\" title=\"\">the schemes</a> for them to be lawful.</p> <p>However, in a 50-page ruling, Mr Justice Foskett said that a letter sent out by the DWP to a 41-year-old benefit claimant did not conform to its own rules on providing clear information, making his six-month benefit sanction for failing to work unpaid for 26 weeks unlawful.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.publicinterestlawyers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lawyers acting for Jamieson Wilson</a>, an unemployed lorry driver who was forced to live on handouts from family and friends after the DWP stripped him of all benefits, say the ruling will affect tens of thousands of jobseekers who have been sanctioned after being sent the same or similar letters and many should therefore be entitled to a rebate.</p> <p>Following the ruling, the DWP confirmed that it had changed its sanction letters but denied any fault, and said it would be appealing against the judgment and contest any rebate claims.</p> <p>The DWP said: \"We don't think there's anything wrong with our letters, and believe they are both clear and concise.</p> <p>\"We will appeal this decision. However, given the judgment we have revised the wording of our standard letters.\"</p> <p>In the written judgment, Foskett ruled that the DWP's standard letter sent out to Wilson was not sufficiently clear and precise to comply with the governments own regulations concerning benefit sanctions.</p> <p>\"It should not be necessary,\" he said, \"[for those on the receiving end of a letter to] \"ferret around for what for most people would be inaccessible regulations to find out his or her position.\"</p> <p>Declaring Wilson's eventual six-month benefit sanction following his refusal to participate in what he called \"forced labour\" unlawful, Foskett said: \"There could be no question of sanctions being validly imposed if no proper notice of the sanction consequences was given.\"</p> <p>The DWP told the Guardian that the same or similar letters have been sent to tens of thousands of benefit claimants but could not yet give <a href=\"http://83.244.183.180/sanction/sanction/LIVE/tabtool.html\" title=\"\">exact numbers</a> on how many people they judged to be affected by the ruling.</p> <p>Foskett also rejected a claim by Cait Reilly, a 23-year-old geology graduate, that a scheme requiring her to work for free at a Poundland discount store breached Article IV of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits forced labour and slavery.</p> <p>Foskett said that \"characterising such a scheme as involving or being analogous to 'slavery' or 'forced labour' seems to me to be a long way from contemporary thinking\".</p> <p>Wilson and Reilly, who <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">first contacted the Guardian with her concerns about government schemes last year</a>, had also argued that the government had failed to publish any official information about the schemes so their clients were unable to understand what their real responsibilities were and what they were compelled to do without falling foul of the rules.</p> <p>During the case the DWP admitted that mistakes had been made in notifying Reilly about the requirements of the Sector Based Work Academy Scheme she was sent on, which meant she had to work unpaid for six weeks included stacking and cleaning shelves in Poundland.</p> <p>Rejecting the main forced labour allegations, the judge said both the schemes under challenge \"are a very long way removed from the kind of colonial exploitation of labour that led to the formulation of Article 4.</p> <p>\"The [human rights] convention is, of course, a living instrument, capable of development to meet modern conditions, and views may reasonably differ about the merits of a scheme that requires individuals to 'work for their benefits' as a means of assisting them back into the workplace.\"</p> <p>The judge added: \"Whether the problems in Miss Reilly's case and Mr Wilson's case were 'merely teething problems' remains to be seen.\"</p> <p>The DWP said: \"We are delighted, although not surprised, that the judge agrees our schemes are not forced labour.</p> <p>\"Comparing our initiatives to slave labour is not only ridiculous but insulting to people around the world facing real oppression.\"</p> <p>She added that the scheme was making a real difference to people's lives. \"Those who oppose this process are actually opposed to hard work and they are harming the life chances of unemployed young people who are trying to get on.\"</p> <p>however, the judge also quashed any impression that either of the claimants were \"benefit scroungers\".</p> <p>\"In relation to Miss Reilly and to Mr Wilson it is important that it is appreciated that each has been actively looking for work: they have not taken their objections to the overall scheme as a means of avoiding employment and seeking simply to rely on benefits,\" he said.</p> <p>Public Interest Lawyers, representing Wilson and Reilly, said they would also appeal against the ruling to a higher court.</p> <p>Wilson said: \"I am pleased that the DWP's decision to strip me of my benefits for six months had been found to be unlawful.</p> <p>\"It has been very difficult for me to live without my jobseekers allowance since May. I hope that I and all the thousands of others who have had their benefits unlawfully removed will now be quickly reimbursed.\"</p> <p>PIL solicitor Tessa Gregory said the issuing of unlawful warning letters meant that \"tens of thousands of people stripped of their benefits must now be entitled to reimbursement by the DWP\".</p> <p>PIL added: \"Today's decision should mean that many of those subjected to benefit sanctions will be entitled to reimbursement by the Department of Work and Pensions.</p> <p>\"It is truly extraordinary that the government has found itself in this position by failing to provide basic information to those affected.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nawra.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers</a> called on the government to launch an urgent review. It said: \"It's a disgrace that people have had benefits stopped because of misleading information routinely issued by the DWP. The DWP must now urgently review all such cases. Sanctions plunge people into severe hardship and advisers see the harm that sanctions cause to claimants and their families.\"</p>",
  "<p>Technology and gadgets are often seen as a male-dominated preserve. But when it comes to mobile, it's clear that in many respects women are actually taking the lead and brands need to design and develop their apps and m-commerce services with this in mind.</p> <p>Recent research that we conducted at <a href=\"http://www.ogilvyaction.com/\" title=\"\">OgilvyAction</a> into the mobile behaviour of 1,000 UK consumers backs this up. We found that 56% of women own a smartphone, as opposed to 51% of men, and BlackBerry is clearly their preferred platform (21% of women against 15% of men). There is an argument that the more functional approach of BlackBerry and often cheaper devices appeal to younger and especially female audiences.</p> <p>But even more importantly, women are more likely to use their phones for more than just calls: one in six had bought something on their mobile, opposed to one in nine men. They are also far more likely to purchase groceries, clothing or toys via m-commerce.</p> <p>So why does mobile appeal to women? Our research found that one third (35%) thought it was easier to buy on a mobile than on a desktop or laptop (against only a quarter of men). Similarly, 42% of women think mobile commerce is faster (vs one third of men) and 55% think it's more convenient, as opposed to 40% of men.</p> <p>What becomes swiftly apparent is that mobile plays perfectly into women who are looking for a simpler, more convenient way to buy online \u2013 particularly those who may be already out and about on the high street than sitting at home in front of the computer.</p> <p>Our research also found that women are more likely than men to go in-store and take a photo for future reference, or to use a price comparison app or an online voucher or another sales promotion (although, interestingly, men are actually far more likely to scan QR codes).</p> <p>The research also found that women are more likely to use their mobiles to shop around rather than sticking with the services of the store they're standing in. Also, 46% of men will visit the store's own website (against 42% of women), but just under a half of women will visit a competitor's website on their mobile.</p> <p>All these statistics show that brands need to understand this female audience when it comes to m-commerce. First, it's about research: nearly half of women will buy something via the mobile if they've used the device to research the best price first (as opposed to only a third of men). Second, they're more likely than men to prefer using a mobile-dedicated site rather than an app for that purchase.</p> <p>But although many women may prefer a mobile site to an app, it doesn't mean they shy away from the app market. Quite the contrary; in fact, our research found that women are significantly more likely than men to regularly use mobile apps in sectors such as health, entertainment, lifestyle, social networking and, perhaps contrary to another stereotype, games.</p> <p>\u2022 Health \u2013 9% of women use health apps a lot vs 4% of men.</p> <p>\u2022 Entertainment \u2013 28% of women use entertainment mobile apps a lot vs 15% of men.</p> <p>\u2022 Lifestyle \u2013 17% of women use lifestyle apps frequently vs 8% of men.</p> <p>\u2022 Social networking \u2013 48% of women use social apps a lot vs 26% of men.</p> <p>\u2022 Games \u2013 37% of women use gaming apps regularly vs 26% of men.</p> <p>Whereas men might choose a console or laptop for their gaming fix, women are both increasingly likely to play games online and to do so on their mobiles. The biggest difference, however, lies in social networking, where our research reinforces the now commonly-held view that women are leading the charge online.</p> <p>In the US, Google Ad Planner has calculated that 82% of active Pinterest users are female, while Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has said that female Facebookers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/mar/02/female-species-more-digital-male\" title=\"\">have 8% more friends and are responsible for 62% of sharing on the network</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/PNLondon/men-are-from-foursquare-women-are-from-facebook\" title=\"\">recent Porter Novelli research</a> found that almost two-thirds (65%) of UK females access social media at least once a week, compared with around half (51%) of men. It also revealed that a similar percentage (64%) of social-media active women, as opposed to 56% of men, follow brands in order to find better discounts.</p> <p>Brands are already taking this behaviour into account in their social media marketing, but it's clear that the same shifts of tone of voice and approach (ie towards messaging that will appeal more to women) that we've seen in their presence on social networks should equally be applied in the mobile environment.</p> <p>In an increasingly feminised digital media environment, mobile sites and apps designed more with female customers in mind may well be the best way for businesses to attract a higher proportion of mobile business.</p> <p><em>Simon Stebbing is managing director of digital at </em><a href=\"http://www.ogilvyaction.com/\" title=\"\"><em>OgilvyAction</em></a><em> \u2013 follow them on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ogilvyaction\" title=\"\"><em>@ogilvyaction</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Greenwash. Some would argue it happens all the time. Indeed, as a CSR professional I have been accused of aiding and abetting greenwash myself. I like to think otherwise, but I can see why people hold those views, when companies seem to do good with one hand and bad with the other.</p> <p>Imagine what people will think when they see those same companies with a website that ends with .eco. It could well be happening by next year but by working together, the global environmental community could ensure .eco is not greenwash. Instead it can become a vehicle for improving corporate sustainability performance.</p> <p>In June, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the organisation that runs the Internet, <a href=\"http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-13jun12-en\" title=\"\">announced</a> that 1,910 different companies had applied to run 1,410 new top-level domain names (those website suffixes like .com). Sometimes these are companies aiming to protect their brand name such as .apple and .google (which is also applying for .earth), while others include geographic domains such as .scot. When the winning companies start selling these next year, we will see what has been described as the digital equivalent of the 19th century American landgrab.</p> <p>There's money to be made in this new digital landscape, so perhaps it is not surprising that 751 of these applied-for domain names are contested. Intriguingly, industry bigwigs Sedo have <a href=\"https://www.sedo.com/fileadmin/documents/resources/gTLD_Values_Factsheet_US_RGB.pdf\" title=\"\">rated .eco</a> as one of the top ten new domains in terms of value. Of the four applicants to run .eco, one commercial applicant has applied to run a total of 306 domain names and another 91. I think it is safe to say they are in it for the money.</p> <p>That is where the community bid which has been submitted is different. Convened by Vancouver-based Big Room, the <a href=\"http://doteco.org/\" title=\"\">doteco.org community bid</a> has been put together after an exhaustive five-year process of consultation and policy development with stakeholders from the environmental and sustainability community including over 50 international groups such as Greenpeace International and WBCSD. And these community groups remain involved in the governance of .eco, with the current co-chairs being WWF International and the Akatu Institute, based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p> <p>The community bid's policies would mean that only companies that commit to sustainability and publicly report performance against key metrics will have the right to run websites that end .eco.</p> <p>These metrics will be searchable and comparable through .eco, thus providing consumers and others with a valuable resource to help make better-informed decisions about which companies they should buy from. As sustainability professionals, we all recognise the value of more transparency and disclosure.</p> <p>What can the sustainability community do?</p> <p>It can register its support for the community bid.&#xa0;The 60-day window for submitting comments lasts until 12 August. The received wisdom in domain registry circles is that winning a community bid is next to impossible, because it is easy to drum up a couple of groups that object to the community designation. Dark mutterings are that ICANN may not unearth links between objectors and commercial interests that stand to gain from .eco not being awarded to the community. As individuals and organisations involved in sustainability, we can show our support for the doteco.org application <a href=\"https://gtldcomment.icann.org/comments-feedback/applicationcomment/login;jsessionid=826C24ED345C6AA575BBC975529B2FFF\" title=\"\">here on the ICANN website</a>. Let's ensure that instead of being a licence for digital greenwash, .eco is a force for positive environmental change.</p> <p><em>Adam Garfunkel is an associate CSR consultant with Two Tomorrows, a DNV company.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Monday mornings for Dr Tim Brabants will soon consist of the usual dash to work, dodging the rush-hour traffic on his way to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. For now, though, he is still a defending Olympic champion, after paddling his kayak into the final of the men's K1 1,000m sprint by the narrowest of margins. While his medal hopes appear slim, this is not a man who lies down easily.</p> <p>The Beijing gold medallist, who also has two bronze medals in his collection, has already fought his way back from shoulder surgery and a slipped disc, and feared his sporting career was over when he tore a pectoral tendon during a bench-pressing gym session in 2010. When he finished fifth in his heat it seemed the long months of recuperation might have been in vain but he dug deep in his semi-final to qualify by less than five-hundredths of a second.</p> <p>From the stands it looked like bad news initially, the cheers which have echoed across Dorney Lake during this Games dying in British throats as his younger Bulgarian rival Miroslav Kirchev appeared to pip him for fourth place in their semi-final. The official timings, though, insisted Brabants had finished the faster and ensured a safe passage through to the final in his fourth Olympic Games.</p> <p>Even the 35-year-old Brabants feared he had not made it. \"When I crossed the line I didn't know. The Bulgarian guy is coming through the ranks quite quickly and, because of the wind, I knew he had a more favourable lane than I did. We were both looking at each other not knowing who'd won until it came up on the scoreboard.\"</p> <p>The home crowd, as was the case during the rowing regatta, played its part. \"With the wind blowing across it was the worst lane I could possibly have hoped for. But it was the best lane in terms of the crowd. It was amazing the noise coming from the crowd in the last 200 metres.\"</p> <p>Whether Brabants can find another gear in Wednesday's final remains to be seen. He acknowledges it will require something \"special\" even to make the podium but is refusing to give up hope. \"Everyone's got a chance. The last four international races we've had have had four different winners. At the top it's that tight. It's anyone's race unless someone pulls out an exceptional performance.\"</p> <p>Either way he will be back working as a junior registrar in A&amp;E next month. \"I'll be doing anything from pulling pen-tops out of people's ears to performing chest compressions on someone who's had a cardiac arrest. I love it. You get as much of a kick out of performing in that environment as you do in this one. Then again, a lot of my colleagues up in Nottingham have been texting me saying I'm doing the right thing rather than medicine at the moment.\"</p> <p>The women's K4 of Jessica Walker, Rachel Cawthorn, Angela Hannah and Louisa Sawers qualified fourth-fastest for Wednesday's final but Richard Jefferies finished a distant last in his 1,000m single canoe semi-final. Jefferies, who was selected for the Olympics after being recruited through the Sporting Giants talent-spotting scheme, is also due to compete in the 200m canoe sprint on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>So, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/the-killing-canceled-amc-338554\" title=\"\">the US version of The Killing has been axed</a>. \"Finally\", may well be the response of many fans of the original version of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_(Danish_TV_series)\" title=\"\">Forbrydelsen</a> who wondered why they bothered to remake it in the first place.</p> <p>However, rather than learn from this seeming folly, executives from the US are buying up the rights to remake Nordic drama with as much enthusiasm as box-set addicts had for the original versions. FX, the home of The Shield and Justified have announced they are making <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/07/fxs-louie-russell-brand-renewed-network-orders-the-bridge-drama-pilot/\" title=\"\">a pilot of a US version of the The Bridge</a>, where the story that hinges around a murdered woman found lying across the Swedish/Danish border will be swapped for US/Mexico. NBC is hoping to emulate the successof political drama The West Wing <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2011/09/nbc-to-adapt-danish-drama-borgen-with-fnls-david-hudgins-and-jason-katims/\" title=\"\">with an adaption of the Danish political drama, Borgen</a>, and Those Who Kill, the Danish TV police series that was broadcast on ITV3 earlier in the year is also getting the make-over treatment.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of US remakes of foreign-language TV shows and films, apparently based on the belief among industry executives that large swathes of the American public are not willing to sit through subtitled programmes, however strong the quality of the drama itself. Whether this is true or not, the terrestrial networks and cable channels seem unwilling to risk losing advertisers or subscribers in order to find out.</p> <p>So, for producers looking for the next big hit the logic is obvious; buy the rights to an incredibly well-written drama with a proven track record of success in its home country, make a few tweaks here and there, and you have the next \"must see\" drama on your hands.</p> <p>Of course it is easy to dismiss the US as having a lack of subtlety when it comes to the art of on-screen storytelling, but The Killing came from AMC, the cable channel that commissioned Mad Men and Breaking Bad \u2013 two of the bravest and most critically acclaimed dramas of recent years. And why should Homeland, the remake of the Israeli drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/may/05/homeland-hatufim-gideon-raff\" title=\"\">Hatufim</a>, be one of the big contenders at this year's Emmys if this was really the case? Scandinavian screen writers have a huge respect for US drama, and consider series such as The Wire and The Sopranos as proof they are masters of the art. The producers of Occupied, an original TV drama written by Jo Nesbo (also considered to have development potential for the US market) that goes into production in the new year, have invited an American screenwriter over to Norway to teach them the finer points of the US style.</p> <p>The UK is of course not averse to a remake; there's the BBC's lavish and heavily stylised incarnation of Detective Wallander, and \u2013 cringe, if you hadn't heard before \u2013 a British/French version of The Bridge in the pipeline, where the corpse will no doubt be found lying somewhere in the middle of the channel tunnel.</p> <p>Ultimately, for fans of the original versions of Nordic TV drama it does not really matter whether remakes by foreign countries flounder or are hugely successful. What does matter is if all the money now flooding into the industry changes it for the worse.</p> <p>The show's creators now have the pressure to deliver to a global audience as well as the potentially distracting trappings of international fame and success. \"You have to keep your plough in the ground,\" says Bo Ehrhardt, a producer on the original Danish version of The Bridge. \"A lot of people did their best work when no one knew who they were. You have to come up with good stories, otherwise you'll lose your small audience at home as well as the big international one.\"</p> <p>Hopefully they will \u2013 and then foreign drama departments can continue to plunder Nordic TV drama's back catalogue as much as they like.</p>",
  "<p>Dan Harris's tragic death last Wednesday and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/02/bradley-wiggins-law-cyclists-helmets?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Bradley Wiggins' response</a> have put cycle safety in the news again. But while we'd all love <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/aug/02/bradley-wiggins-helmet-cyclist-death\" title=\"\">better cycling infrastructure</a>, there is neither the money nor the political will to make our streets safer for cyclists. For all the positive talk about increasing the <a href=\"http://www.theaa.com/motoring_advice/safety/cycle-safety-debate.html\" title=\"\">bike awareness component of the driving test</a>, there is a limit to how much you can tell someone to be aware of their position on the road, and a limit to the effect that theoretical knowledge can have. So why not make cycle proficiency a mandatory condition for getting a driving licence?</p> <p>Every driver should have firsthand experience of what it's like to ride a bike in the traffic. Any driver wanting to acquire an HGV licence has to get a normal driving licence first. And people wanting to take a car on the road should have the experience of cycling alongside cars and other vehicles. Drivers need to know how smaller vehicles and their more vulnerable users behave on the road, and the only real way to understand how cyclists act is to have a go at being one. Providing safety training to more cyclists on the streets is obviously desirable, but mandatory cycle training and licensing, often suggested by the more irate and vocal petrolhead crowd, would be a disaster and create a barrier to cycling take-up.</p> <p>An additional benefit would be that many more people would get a chance to see how convenient and safe cycling is. Many people are still too scared to travel by bike. In <a href=\"http://www.brake.org.uk/latest-news/commuters-call-for-safer-streets-for-cycling-to-enable-more-to-get-on-their-bikes.htm\" title=\"\">a recent survey</a>, 46% of those who took part said they would switch to cycling for short journeys if roads were safer. While there is plenty of practical work to be done in this area, changing people's perception of what is safe by increasing their confidence works wonders too. <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/bike-training-success-for-london-borough-18822/\" title=\"\">In a 2008 study</a> of people who had received cycle training in Lambeth, half of those who cycled more after training said they felt more confident.</p> <p>There are also health and economic advantages. A <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12\" title=\"\">recent paper in the Lancet</a> concluded that replacing short journeys in cars and on public transport could save the NHS \u00a317bn over 20 years.</p> <p>The average cost of learning to drive is \u00a31363, according to <a href=\"http://www.uswitch.com/car-insurance/learn-to-drive/\" title=\"\">uSwitch</a>. The additional cost to the learner driver, thus, would not be significant. For example, a complete cycle training course for a resident of Hounslow would cost \u00a382.50, giving the learner four hours on-road experience. For someone with the most basic cycling ability who could skip the first session, the cost drops to \u00a355. Hounslow's provider, <a href=\"http://www.cycleexperience.com/adult-training-applicant-book3.php?adulttrainingvenueid=18\" title=\"\">CycleExperience</a>, makes a small charge for bike rental, while other outfits will loan a bike for free.</p> <p>Many local councils offer free or highly subsidised bike training, and while the demand might put pressure on these services the fact remains that cycle proficiency lessons are very economical and would not significantly increase the cost of learning to drive. In fact, cycling could save them money \u2013 60% of adults who participated in the Lambeth study cycle more after having received the training, saving money on petrol and public transport.</p> <p>Evidence suggests that having more cyclists on the road <a href=\"http://www.ctc.org.uk/resources/Campaigns/CTC_Safety_in_Numbers.pdf\" title=\"\">decreases the proportion who are involved in accidents</a>, so more people taking up cycling makes it safer. Introducing a measure which is guaranteed both to get more people on bikes and make sure drivers understand cycling is a no-brainer. It would be relatively cheap, have a big impact and would improve cyclist safety without infrastructure investment.</p>",
  "<p>Many academics are now enjoying a brief breather before the summer term begins but not so long ago, we were in April, battling through the cruellest month in (Anglo-North American) universities. April marks the point at which the yearly academic cycle reaches its peak with final exams, which are preceded by the crushing weight of end-of-term assignments. Some students, worn out by the demands of the season, lapse into a state of caffeine-fuelled zombie-like vacancy. For those of us on the receiving end of their work, there is the prospect of a mountain of marking that forms the final obstacle before this - the summer holidays.</p> <p>Based on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/03/tim-leunig-on-teaching-and-marking\" title=\"\">feelings expressed</a> regularly by many professors and graduate students, I don't think grading is something many people see as a form of genuine and enjoyable engagement with students, unless it is a case where the course director has been creative with the assignments and/or most of the students are motivated to work hard. Instead, professors and teaching assistants tend to experience grading as a chore (or in some cases, an ordeal) that must be completed so that marks can be submitted \u2013 a technocratic necessity rather than a pedagogical one.</p> <p>This makes sense for a few reasons. Grading is not an inherently meaningful activity, but more a function of a hierarchical institution, that mass produces graduates. A letter or number grade assigns a relative value to a student's performance, which is then used as a measure of his or her value within the educational system overall. Outside of this system, assigned marks have little relevance.</p> <p>As such, in an increasingly competitive environment students may see grades more as tokens of exchange than signifiers of acquired skill. That's partly because it's so hard to assess genuine learning and link that to an objective 'standard'. Students may (rightly) see grades as flexible, and act on this assumption, possibly encouraged by the consumerist tendency that comes with attaching a price tag to education - conflating payment for access with payment for an outcome.</p> <p>Another issue is that we've institutionalised the factors that make grading unenjoyable. The process and schedule of the academic year ensures this: grading tends to happen all at the same time, there's usually quite a lot of it, and because students are fatigued and under pressure, what we see might not be representative of their potential.</p> <p>In the past I've also felt as if I have little influence over the outcomes I see when I'm grading assignments. I remember this was among the first issues that alerted me to 'something rotten' in the state of academia, years ago when I started working as an undergraduate teaching assistant. It wasn't that I didn't care \u2013 I cared a lot; I wanted then, and still want now, to help students to learn and write well and earn the marks they desired. But I didn't have the time and energy (and skill) to provide the level of help they seemed to require. Later, it was both relieving and distressing to realise I was working with all their past and present educational (and life) experiences, not just my own inadequacies.</p> <p>A student's pre-higher education experience matters but grading must also be assessed within the institutional framework in which university teaching takes place. Not only do we have more students now, but the students themselves must juggle their involvement with education with other demands on their time and energy. We must also find ways of engaging with, and helping students from more varied educational backgrounds, without making unreasonable demands on those who do the teaching (and grading). And somehow, as teachers in this system we must become more 'efficient', given the perpetual economic tightening - all the while, there are larger connections to job insecurity for academic staff.</p> <p>This is where governance meets (and clashes with) pedagogy in higher education. And for all these reasons, the conditions of post-secondary teaching demand attention at the level of the egg timer often used to ration each minute of essay marking. Grading, and the feelings and problems associated with it, show us only a few of the ways in which the long-term devaluing of teaching in the academic economy is both experienced and perpetuated in our everyday lives.</p> <p><em>Melonie Fullick is currently a PhD student working on research in post-secondary education, policy and governance at </em><a href=\"http://www.yorku.ca/web/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>York University</em></a><em> in Canada.

  "<p>A \"new frontier\" in mining is set to be opened up by the underwater extraction of resources from the seabed off the coast of Papua New Guinea, despite vehement objections from environmentalists and local activists.</p> <p>Canadian firm <a href=\"http://www.nautilusminerals.com/s/Home.asp\" title=\"\">Nautilus Minerals</a> has been granted a 20-year licence by the PNG government to commence the Solwara 1 project, the world's first commercial deep sea mining operation.</p> <p>Nautilus will mine an area 1.6km beneath the Bismarck Sea, 50km off the coast of the PNG island of New Britain. The ore extracted contains high-grade copper and gold.</p> <p>The project is being carefully watched by other mining companies keen to exploit opportunities beneath the waves.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/\" title=\"\">The Deep Sea Mining (DSM) campaign</a>, a coalition of groups opposing the PNG drilling, estimates that 1 million sq km of sea floor in the Asia-Pacific region is under exploration licence. Nautilus alone has around 524,000 sq km under licence, or pending licence, in PNG, Tonga, New Zealand and Fiji.</p> <p>\"PNG is the guinea pig for deep-sea mining,\" says Helen Rosenbaum, the campaign's co-ordinator. \"The mining companies are waiting in the wings ready to pile in. It's a new frontier, which is a worrying development.</p> <p>\"The big question the locals are asking is 'What are the risks?' There is no certain answer to that, which should trigger a precautionary principle.</p> <p>\"But Nautilus has found a place so far away from people that they can get away with any impacts. They've picked an underfunded government without the regulation of developed countries that will have no way of monitoring this properly.\"</p> <p>The mining process will involve levelling underwater hydrothermal \"chimneys\", which spew out vast amounts of minerals. Sediment is then piped to a waiting vessel, which will separate the ore from the water before pumping the remaining liquid back to the seafloor.</p> <p>The DSM campaign has compiled <a href=\"http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/report/\" title=\"\">a report</a>, co-authored by a professor of zoology from University of Oxford, which warns that underwater mining will decimate deep water organisms yet to be discovered by science, while sediment plumes could expose marine life to toxic metals that will work their way up the food chain to tuna, dolphins and even humans.</p> <p>\"There are indirect impacts that could clog the gills of fish, affect photosynthesis and damage reefs,\" says Rosenbaum.</p> <p>Activists also claim that <a href=\"http://www.cares.nautilusminerals.com/ResponsibleVision.aspx?npath=1\" title=\"\">an environmental analysis by Nautilus</a> fails to properly address the impact of the mining on ecosystems, nor explains any contingency plan should there be a major accident.</p> <p>Wenceslaus Magun, a PNG-based activist, told the Guardian that local fishing communities are concerned about the mining and are planning to challenge the exploration licence.</p> <p>\"We are really concerned because the sea is the source of our spirituality and sustenance,\" he said. \"The company has not explained to us the risks of deep sea mining. They haven't responded to my requests for information.\"</p> <p>\"The government has turned a blind eye to the concern of its own people. We are mobilising people to raise funds to take this to court and retract Nautilus' licence.\"</p> <p>However, proponents of deep-sea mining point out that it is potentially far less damaging than land-based extraction.</p> <p>\"The material is very high grade so you have to mine less in order to get the same amount of metal,\" said Chris Yeats, a geologist at <a href=\"http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/Earth-Science--Resource-Engineering/ChrisYeats.aspx\" title=\"\">CSIRO</a>, the Australian government's scientific arm. \"At those depths there are bacteria, but there's a cut off at around 1,000m where most fish are, so it should have little impact.\"</p> <p>\"Unlike a terrestrial mine, you don't have to build infrastructure such as roads and you don't displace people. You chop off one of these venting chimneys and another one will grow back, so it's a little like the mining equivalent of cutting grass.\"</p> <p>Steve Rogers, the CEO of Nautilus, said the company had gone through a \"rigorous\" study of environmental impact over the past six years.</p> <p>\"This will be a relatively small footprint compared to a mine on land, on an area about the size of a dozen football pitches,\" he said. \"We've sought out the best scientists in the world. We aren't trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes.\"</p> <p>\"This isn't in a fishing area and won't impact coral. Even if it were in a fishing area, it won't affect that upper area where the fish are.\"</p> <p>Rogers said that Nautilus had contacted 15,000 local people in PNG to hold workshops on the project. The company estimates that the 30-month first phase of the mining will bring $142m(\u00a392m) in benefits to the PNG economy, with a plan to employ 70% of the project's staff from the country within three years.</p> <p>Despite these assurances, the project has been delayed by <a href=\"http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/former-aust-chief-justice-to-arbitrate-on-nautilus-dispute-with-png/982344\" title=\"\">an undisclosed commercial dispute between Nautilus and the PNG government</a>, which is currently under arbitration in Sydney.</p> <p>The PNG government has come under fire for taking a 30% equity stake in the project, which will require it to contribute about $25m(\u00a316m) towards infrastructure, provoking accusations of a flagrant conflict of interest.</p> <p>In return, PNG will receive $40.8mn (\u00a326m) in tax from a project estimated to generate $1bn(\u00a3642m) although Rogers said revenue would be \"a long way short of that\") along with a 30% return on what is still a highly experimental mining process.</p> <p>\"It was the government's choice to take a stake, we didn't ask them to do it,\" says Rogers. \"I'd stress that the government isn't threatening any of our mining permits. We're disappointed to be in a dispute with the government but I'm confident we will resolve this.\"</p> <p>What isn't in dispute is that the mining industry is starting to eye major opportunities on the seabed.</p> <p>\"A number of governments are exploring for minerals in this way, such as Russia, Japan, China and the UK,\" said Rogers. \"It will take time, it's not a gold rush, but the demand is increasing.\"</p> <p>Yeats added: \"As the global population increases, we're likely to see large-scale marine mining. How far away that is depends on how successful they are. But we will have to turn to the 70% of the world we currently aren't mining for minerals.\"</p>",
  "<p>It must be the day for takeover speculation.</p> <p>Marketing services group <strong>Creston</strong> has climbed nearly 11% following news after the market closed on Friday that French advertising giant Havas had declared a 5.18% stake. Johnathan Barrett at Singer Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> Unless there is clarity to the contrary there is likely to be bid speculation. In general, larger agencies are significantly more highly rated than smaller peers and therefore acquisitions would be prima facie accretive. The marketing services sector is in good health, despite tough [macroeconomic environment], and larger groups are looking to invest cash flow in acquisitions. Creston [is] both cheap and likely to be subject to approaches unless its valuation rises to reflect the fundamentals of its attractive assets, client list and health unit. </blockquote> <p>News of the stakebuilding has sent Creston 7.63p higher to 78p.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> is still 8.5p better at 349.6p after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/aug/06/marks-spencer-bid-talk-ftse\" title=\"\">weekend reports it could be a target</a>, while <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> has risen 2.5p to 218.5p on talk of a number of possible bidders for its US business Citizens, which could be worth \u00a310bn.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Telecity</strong> has climbed 51p to 889.5p after the data centre operator unveiled a 26.6% rise in half year earnings to \u00a362.6m. and bought its first operation in Finland. The Helsinki-based Tenue, bought for \u00a33.7m, will give Telecity capacity at an important crossroads for growing traffic between Russia and western Europe. Jonathan Imiah at Canaccord Genuity kept his hold recommendation but raised his target price from 700p to 735p:</p> <blockquote> These are yet another strong set of results from Telecity, particularly in the context of a substantial weakening in the euro over the past few months. The entrance into the key Finnish market \u2013 a bridgehead for Scandinavia (adding to <br>the group's existing asset in Stockholm), Russia and Eastern Europe \u2013 makes clear strategic and financial sense. </blockquote> <p><strong>Heritage Oil</strong>, suspended in July at 123p when it announced an $850m deal to buy a major stake in Nigeria's OML 30 and a $370m rights issue to help pay for the purchase, has narrowed its half year losses from $6.9m to $6.7m.</p>",
  "<h2>Athletics is the new cycling</h2> <p>After winning a long jump gold that was a surprise to everyone but him, Greg Rutherford spoke of the way the mindset in UK Athletics had changed over recent years as the \"no compromise\" philosophy espoused to such good effect by rowing, cycling and sailing spread to the most competitive and high profile of Olympic sports. Before, he said, many athletes were happy to turn up and collect the T-shirt \u2013 being at the Games was their victory. Now, winning was everything. That has come with increased investment but also the discipline and focus that flows from the head coach Charles van Commenee. He told them they were the best crop of British athletes in 30 years, and they believed him.</p> <h2>Brits love sport</h2> <p>The Locog chief executive Paul Deighton said on Sunday morning that he had always seen his job as removing any obstacles that could stand in the way of the British public embracing these Games, so confident was he that they would go mad for them given the chance. Every single National Olympic Committee chief or federation panjandrum has paid fulsome tribute to the passion and knowledge of the London crowds. Even for obscure match ups between no hopers in sports of which we traditionally have no knowledge, the atmosphere has been kept bubbling. In the velodrome, the aquatics centre and the main stadium it has been nothing short of a revelation.</p> <h2>Think global, act local</h2> <p>Mo Farah, a proud Londoner but a global citizen, has plucked off all the expertise and know how he can from around the world. Supremely relaxed and affable off the track, ruthlessly driven on it, he has trained at altitude with the Kenyans, commuted across the Atlantic to work with Alberto Salazar at the hi-tech Nike facility in Oregon and availed himself of the best brains in sports science at home. All that came together in a magical 10,000m on Saturday night, when a wave of noise propelled him around the last lap to victory after a masterful display of distance running.</p> <h2>Winning at home takes huge mental strength</h2> <p>Seb Coe said that from the moment she stepped onto the track for her first event \u2013 the 100m hurdles \u2013 it was never in doubt that the poster girl of these Games would win gold. For four years Jessica Ennis has smiled and enthusiastically answered every question, shrugging off the pressure on her shoulders. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/05/london-2012-team-gb-medals\" title=\"\">Afterwards, she revealed the extent of the crushing expectation and admitted to bouts of self doubt</a>. Ben Ainslie did the same, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/05/london-2012-ben-ainslie-fourth-gold?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">saying the experience had been the worst of his life</a>. For those under the most pressure to deliver, there was as much relief as jubilation.</p> <h2>The greatest British Olympian debate will run and run</h2> <p>We started the week debating the claims of Bradley Wiggins, before moving on swiftly to Sir Chris Hoy as he notched his fifth gold. This weekend, as Ben Ainslie displayed all the physical and mental strength that has made him the greatest Olympic sailor of all time, he pushed his claims to the fore.</p> <h2>Athletics can rock</h2> <p>The events of the weekend proved that with a world-class field, in a purpose built arena filled to the gunnels with enthusiastic fans, track and field can put on a show to match any sporting spectacle in the world. The pulsating drama and ear splitting noise of Saturday night will stay with those who were there forever. While there is an ongoing debate about whether music during races as well as before and after is appropriate, the staging and presentation has also been first class. There was only a minor disconnect as the stadium announcer encouraged the crowd to come back for the Diamond League. The big challenge for track and field is to capitalise on its moment in the sun and ensure that the Olympic Stadium is full again for future meetings.</p> <h2>Coe has his magic moments</h2> <p>The London 2012 chairman understands better than most the power of a single transcendent moment that a Games will be remembered by. Cathy Freeman in Sydney or, for a domestic audience, Kelly Holmes in Athens would qualify. He can now add Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah to that list. Privately, Coe would probably swap any number of other medals for one of those moments that transcend sport.</p> <h2>The 100m final is the most intense experience in world sport</h2> <p>To see Usain Bolt's vanquished opponents walking through the press mixed zone with dazed expressions and tears in their eyes is to understand the intense pressure condensed into less than 10 seconds when the eyes of the world are on a 100m strip of track. Bolt's success has helped return the event to its rightful place as the centrepiece of the Games.</p> <h2>Never doubt Usain Bolt</h2> <p>Bolt, of course, laughed his way through the whole thing. He arrived in London with a host of questions about his fitness and form swirling around him, which he brushed off in habitually cool fashion. But they persisted through the heats, until it really mattered. The fervour around the stadium among those who had tickets, and the adulation that rolled down from the stands afterwards, confirmed his status as one of the biggest names in any sport on the planet. With the 200m to come, he said he was halfway to being a legend. Some would say he's already there.</p> <h2>The volunteers are making the Games</h2> <p>Unpaid, forced to wear purple and with only a travel card and a free uniform for their trouble, the army of 70,000 so-called Games Makers are helping transform international perceptions of Britain. Witty, cheery and knowledgable despite long days and often menial tasks, Coe and company owe them a huge debt. On Saturday, when the Park was starting to creak at the seams with an influx of 200,000 people \u2013 leading to long queues for everything from a cup of tea to the opportunity to spend money in the megastore \u2013 it was the volunteers that maintained the atmosphere of cheery goodwill in this corner of east London that has become a mecca for the world's sports fans.</p>",

The forces will impose full control over these areas of Sinai.\"</p> <p>The president convened an emergency meeting with military and security leaders in the aftermath of the assault, which he described as a \"serious challenge to the Egyptian sovereignty\".</p> <p>Following the attack, which was launched just after sunset on Sunday, the Israeli defence minister, Ehud Barak, said it had \"again raise[d] the need for determined Egyptian action to enforce security and prevent terror in the Sinai\".</p> <p>He said Israel had contacted the Egyptian authorities to offer help. \"We hope this will be a fitting wake-up call for the Egyptians to take things in hand on their side more forcefully,\" he told the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee on Monday.</p> <p>Israel has become increasingly concerned about a security vacuum in the Sinai in the 18 months since Hosni Mubarak, the former president and staunch ally of Israel, was deposed in the Egyptian revolution.</p> <p>There have been a number of attacks and attempted attacks on Israel from across the border.</p> <p>Israel says some militant groups in Gaza have joined forces with Islamists operating in the Sinai.

According to a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), eight armed men launched an attack, killing around 15 men and injuring another seven.</p> <p>The militants commandeered two armoured vehicles, which they drove towards the Israeli border. One vehicle exploded on the Egyptian side of the border, and the other broke through the security fence near the Kerem Shalom border crossing and was targeted by Israeli air force planes.</p> <p>The Israeli government spokesman Ofir Gendelman said seven militants had been killed, four on the Israeli side and three in Egypt.</p> <p>The Israeli military instructed Israeli civilians to stay inside their homes while combing the area for other militants who might still be on the Israeli side of the border.</p> <p>Officials say Egypt has deployed at least two helicopter gunships to the Sinai in the hunt for the militants behind the checkpoint attack.</p> <p>Security and military officials said on Monday that more aircraft were expected to arrive in the town of El-Arish before a military campaign against the militants in the area.</p> <p>Egypt and Israel blamed the attack on Islamist militants from both Gaza and the Sinai.</p> <p>Hamas, the Islamist organisation which rules Gaza, issued a statement condemning the attack. It has made efforts to contain militant activity since the end of its war with Israel three and a half years ago.</p> <p>\"Hamas condemns this ugly crime which killed a number of Egyptian soldiers and extends its deep condolences to the families of the victims and to the leadership and the people of Egypt,\" it said.</p> <p>Islamic Jihad and the Popular Resistance Committee, both of which have frequently launched rockets into southern Israel, also condemned the attack.</p> <p>Israeli intelligence services said they had information about an impending infiltration and sent aircraft to strike at the second car the militants had seized from the Egyptian forces. \"We were prepared for it, so there was a hit,\" said the Israeli military spokesman Brig-Gen Yoav Mordechai. The military \"averted a major attack on southern Israel\", he said.</p> <p>The Egyptian authorities closed the Rafah crossing to Gaza following the attack.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, a militant in Gaza was killed and another injured in an Israeli air strike on a motorcycle travelling near the Egyptian border. The IDF said in a statement that it had targeted a \"global jihad-affiliated terrorist squad in the southern Gaza Strip\" which was responsible for an attack on the Israel-Egypt border in June in which an Israeli civilian was killed. Another attack was being planned, the IDF said.</p> <p>However, the two incidents were not connected, according to an IDF spokesman.</p>",
  "<p>Surely one of the most enduring images of London 2012, over and above the herculean sporting achievements of Team GB, will be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jul/30/thomas-heatherwick-olympic-cauldron?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Thomas Heatherwick's copper cauldron</a>. The drawing together of 204 long-stemmed and flaming petals seemed to prompt a collective gasp of delight across the UK \u2013 for its symbolism as well as its technical grace. It was the perfect summation of what had already been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/poll/2012/jul/30/london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony-arts-culture\" title=\"\">a remarkably inventive show</a>, and a powerful reminder to the rest of the world of one of the greatest strengths of this tiny isle: our creativity.</p> <p>Thomas Heatherwick has form in this regard. The survey of his work currently on show in the V&amp;A is not only testament to his personal talent, and to his studio's breadth, ingenuity and skill, but also to the amount of projects he has completed worldwide. Sir John Sorrell, an ambassador for the UK creative industries, recently half-joked that the 'seed cathedral' pavilion Heatherwick designed for the Shanghai Expo last year is almost entirely responsible for China realising the UK is, rather than a nation of stuffy afternoon tea-drinkers, a highly creative place.</p> <p>This reputation for creativity, design and innovation is incredibly important; not just because it feels good but because it makes us competitive. It is one of the few things that still distinguishes us on a world stage, allows us to compete with vastly larger and better resourced nations, and keeps us ahead of the game. This is not new \u2013 from Brunel and the invention of industrialisation alluded to in Boyle's ceremony, to the first ever Great Exhibition, to the William Morrises of the early 20th century, to the swinging sixties, to the first city-wide design festival in London, the UK has been known for its design innovation.</p> <p>And it is not a false reputation. We really are very good at design, which in turn powers the other creative industries. If this is hard to visualise, try imagining how the rest of the Olympic ceremony would have gone without design input: the landscape and set, the costumes, the soundtrack, the digital displays and films, the torch \u2013 all the product of different creative disciplines, but all dependent on design.</p> <p>Beyond the creative industries, design adds value all over the place, not least in manufacturing. You can see this in the number of global car companies that base their design functions in the UK: JLR, Nissan, Ford, Tata, as well as the home grown brands \u2013 Bentley, Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce.</p> <p>But, as we have learned with sporting prowess, you get out what you put in. Invest enough money in the late 1990s, and in 2012 you have a Tour de France champion. The same is true with design and the other creative industries it supports. We are good at the moment because we've had a great creative education system over the last 50 years, a solid manufacturing base (though many people will try and insist otherwise) and an open and permissive business environment, all set within a very socially liberal context.</p> <p>But we cannot be complacent. It would be a shame if reinvesting in our creativity had to be prompted by some form of national design sector 'failure' \u2013 just as it took the British Olympic squad's poor performance at the 1996 Games in Atlanta to kick start policymakers into providing appropriate (and, in some disciplines, world-leading) levels of funding for British athletes.</p> <p>Only a fool would believe that other rapidly industrialising nations aren't desperately seeking to move up the industrial scale. There is no reason why China would want to remain the home of low-value manufacturing. They are explicitly seeking to upgrade from 'Made in China' to 'Designed in China' \u2013 hundreds of design schools are flowering at the instigation of the Chinese government.</p> <p>What is worrying, then, is the very real possibility that in the UK we underrate our skills in this area, underinvest, and risk undermining one of our greatest assets. Our politicians are unfortunately the worst culprits. It was allegedly almost impossible to get a British politician to turn up and represent (take credit for) the UK <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2010/apr/30/china-world-expo-shanghai?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">at the Shanghai Expo</a>. There is scant evidence that Osborne's 2011 budget statement, in which he committed to economic recovery through a 'March of the Makers', has any real policy to back it up.</p> <p>In fact we have no long term design policy or strategy at all. We are potentially on the verge of removing art and design as statutory curriculum subjects at school; they are already excluded as qualifying subjects for the English Baccalaureate, the new gold standard for achievement at GCSE. It is becoming more and more expensive to train in these subjects at university.</p> <p>Designers' IP is not protected in the same way as other industries \u2013 design infringement carries no criminal sanction. Too few businesses (and government departments) understand the real value of design, as a fundamental process and strategic asset, rather than a logo, or some nice cushions. And it would be very surprising if <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/21/heseltine-review-public-bodies-private-sector?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Lord Heseltine's competitiveness review</a> addresses these sectors with the same seriousness as, for example, manufacturing.</p> <p>To remain competitive, we have to take design seriously, and not make the mistake of believing it's 'nice-to-have'.

  "<p>House prices fell by 0.6% in July, reversing much of the 0.8% increase recorded in June, according to mortgage lender Halifax.</p> <p>The bank's latest snapshot of the housing market echoes that of rival lender <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/01/house-prices-sharpest-drop-since-2009\" title=\"House prices hit by sharpest drop since 2009\">Nationwide, which reported a 0.7% fall in July</a>. But while Nationwide put the annual decline at 2.6%, Halifax said it was just 0.6%.</p> <p>The three-month change, which is regarded as a better indicator of the state of the housing market, showed prices remained flat. Halifax now puts the average value of a UK home at \u00a3161,094 \u2013 about the same as in the summer of 2009.</p> <p>The bank's housing economist, Martin Ellis, said the ongoing stability in prices was a result of a lack of activity in the market. According to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the ratio of house sales to unsold properties has changed very little over the past 21 months.</p> <p>Ellis said: \"Looking forward, we expect little change in prices over the remainder of 2012, so long as the economic climate in the UK does not worsen substantially.\"</p> <p>However, Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the latest round of price data heightened his belief that the market would fall further over the remainder of 2012.</p> <p>\"With the economy slumping in the second quarter, and the outlook highly uncertain amid worryingly strong domestic and international (mainly eurozone) headwinds, we believe there is a very real and mounting danger that house prices could fall by appreciably more than 3% from current levels.\"</p> <p>Property website Rightmove said homebuyers and sellers were locked in a stand-off over prices, which could lead to a further fall in sales over the coming months.</p> <p>The website, which surveyed almost 40,000 home movers, found that 49% of those planning to buy within the next 12 months believe house prices in their local area are above what they regard as \"fair and reasonable\". Only a third of those expecting to sell held the same view, suggesting they may not be prepared to cut prices to secure a sale.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/jul/30/mortgage-approvals-slump-bank-of-england\" title=\"Mortgage approvals slump to 18-month low\">Recent figures from mortgage lenders</a> show that approvals for new loans fell to an 18-month low in June and, at 44,192, are running at about half of the average monthly level seen since 1993.</p> <p>The government's new funding for lending scheme is designed to boost mortgage lending and kickstart the housing market, but so far <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/03/mortgage-rate-war\" title=\"Mortgage rate war rages as banks court the 'lowest-risk' borrowers\">many of the deals have been aimed at those with large deposits</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last two years real wages have fallen, on average, by 7%, a downward trend set to continue well into 2013. Of course, with an economy that is still shrinking, some fall in wages and living standards was inevitable. But what appears to be happening is a direct attempt by the government to engineer, under the cover of the crisis, a further fall in the share of the national cake going to earnings.</p> <p>This comes on top of a three-decade long downward trend in the wage-share. The proportion of the workforce in low-paid work has almost doubled over the last two decades and now stands at more than a fifth. Some groups of workers \u2013 from forklift truck drivers to bakers \u2013 are now paid less in real terms than in the 1980s, while the UK now has the second highest share of employees in low pay (after the United States) among leading economies.</p> <p>Five forces are exerting downward pressure on earnings. First, the near four-year long freeze (a real cut after inflation) on public sector pay. Second, voluntary sector organisations and charities responsible for a large share of public service provision are responding to disproportionate budget cuts by imposing sharp cuts in pay. Many care home staff and those working with the homeless are facing pay cuts of up to a fifth.</p> <p>Third, pay freezes have also been commonplace in parts of the private sector including distribution and manufacturing and especially in low-paid sectors such as fast food and construction. Fourth, the minimum wage rate has been increased by less than inflation for three years running, and is now back to its 2004 level. Finally, the widely floated plans for regional pay rates across the public sector will mean paying staff less in poorer parts of the country.</p> <p>Many of these pay cuts are likely to prove permanent, with the falls unrestored even when the economy recovers. Much of the voluntary sector, for example, is engaged in a process of downgrading, with new staff being recruited to do the same job on lower pay scales. This is history repeating itself. In the Great Depression of the early 1930s, most developed economies followed the call made by the multimillionaire US treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon, after the 1929 crash, to \"liquidate labour\". Forty-five years later, at the height of the next global economic crisis in the mid-1970s, Arnold Weber, the head of President Nixon's wages and prices board, called on business to \"zap labour\".</p> <p>The \"liquidationists\" are back. Just how far the tightening squeeze is likely to go is revealed in a table tucked away in a report by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/economic-and-fiscal-outlook-november-2010/\" title=\"\">This shows</a> a fall in the share of wages in the economy of a further four percentage points by 2016.</p> <p>The government no doubt hopes that stagnant wages will boost Britain's competitiveness. Yet much of big business is sitting on record cash piles and could afford higher wages without losing its competitive edge. Moreover, making the labour force pay a disproportionate price for a crisis for which they are not responsible is self-destructive economics. Cutting pay will simply squeeze even more of the lifeblood out of an economy already suffering from a severe shortage of demand. Indeed, falling real wages since 2009 is the key explanation for the economy sinking back into recession.</p> <p>What is happening is a largely ignored rebalancing of the economy of the wrong kind. What is needed is a reversal of the long-term fall in the wage share, taking it back closer to the level of the immediate postwar decades. Indeed, <a href=\"http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/oecd-employment-outlook-2012_empl_outlook-2012-en\" title=\"\">both the International Monetary Fund and the OECD have acknowledged</a> that wages-shares have been falling too sharply in many richer nations.</p> <p>A continuing squeeze on pay is merely likely to prolong the crisis, while opening an even wider pay gap and taking Britain further down the road of a low-paid economy.</p>",
  "<p>Summer seems to be here so it's time for a bit of bid speculation, this time surrounding <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong>.</p> <p>As markets take a breather after Friday's rises on the back of better than expected US jobs data, the retailer is heading higher. Its shares have climbed 7.6p to 348.7p following <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/9452750/Banks-see-MandS-as-bid-target-after-shares-fall.html\" title=\"\">weekend reports</a> that bankers were lining it up as a \u00a36bn bid target after its recent falls. Analyst Clive Black at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> That M&amp;S has made no comment on these stories as yet implies that the company's board has nothing to consider as yet to our minds; we would imagine that the regulatory authorities will be keeping a watch on matters. Whether there are M&amp;S files being dusted off by inactive and bored bankers on the one hand and financial buyers on the other; well who knows? That said, we doubt that the stories are total flights of fancy or fiction. </blockquote> <p>He added that Marks was on his buying list anyway, based on its medium-term cash generation prospects once it has completed its investment programme and it can reap the benefits:</p> <blockquote> Time will tell as to whether M&amp;S is subject to a bid approach. The stock may be temporarily marked up on the back of the growing band of press stories. However, we deem that M&amp;S' brand, market positions and stores to be worth a lot more than the present stock multiples. Accordingly, should bid talk become a lot more serious the upside should, to Shore Capital, be material. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has dipped 11.14 points to 5776.14 as investors bank some profits.</p> <p><strong>Burberry</strong> is up 22p at \u00a313.27, with weekend hits at more action by the Chinese central bank to boost its economy helping luxury goods groups, which see the area as important for their future growth.</p> <p><strong>Centrica</strong> has fallen 4.3p to 319.2p and <strong>SSE</strong> has slipped 10p to \u00a313.18 after Deutsche Bank cut its ratings on both from buy to hold. Analyst Martin Brough said:</p> <blockquote> The expected UK energy market transformation is well underway, but political consensus on energy policy is breaking down. Weakness in global commodity prices makes upstream investments look less valuable, and we cut [our recommendation on] Centrica and SSE. </blockquote>",
  "<p>The Treasury chief secretary, Danny Alexander, one of the most senior Liberal Democrats, has said Britain's credit rating is not the \"be-all and end-all\".</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, has always put enormous store by the rating, issuing a statement on the eve of the Olympics opening ceremony to highlight how one credit agency had again reasserted Britain's coveted triple-A status.</p> <p>Alexander's remarks probably represent the first time a government minister has downplayed the importance of the credit rating, but they reflect a wider view within his party that it needs to push harder for what it describes as a \"Plan A plus\" economic policy, in which greater emphasis is put on government investment, especially in housing, to boost demand and spending.</p> <p>\"The credit rating is not the be-all and end-all,\" Alexander said. \"What matters is have we got the right policy mix for the country to get people back into work, to support economic growth, to deal with the huge problems in our public finances, and the credit agencies reflect on those things and the ratings they give are a reflection of the credibility of that mix.\"</p> <p>It has been pointed out in some Lib Dem circles that the US lost its triple-A rating with some credit agencies before the summer but has not experienced a hike in interest rates.</p> <p>Typically, a credit rating downgrade is seen as a threat to interest rates as markets take fright that a country will be unable to pay its debt.</p> <p>Last Friday, Standards &amp; Poor's said in a statement: \"We project that despite recent weakness, the UK economy should begin to recover in the second half of 2012 and steadily strengthen, and we expect economic policy to continue focusing on closing the fiscal gap.</p> <p>\"In our view, monetary flexibility remains a key credit strength owing to the British pound sterling's role as a global reserve currency.\"</p> <p>S&amp;P said its stable outlook for the rating reflected its \"expectation that the UK government will implement the bulk of its fiscal consolidation programme and that the economy should recover in the remainder of 2012 and strengthen thereafter\".</p> <p>But it added: \"We could lower the ratings in particular if the pace and extent of fiscal consolidation slows beyond what we currently expect.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/26/david-cameron-britain-economic-figures\" title=\"\">Dreadful growth figures</a> released at the end of July showed the UK economy sliding deeper into recession, with a 0.7% fall in GDP between April and June.</p> <p>After Osborne hailed the S&amp;P judgment, David Cameron swung behind his chancellor, rejecting speculation that he may be shifted in a cabinet reshuffle and asserting that Osborne \"is going nowhere\". Labour responded by saying that if Osborne is going nowhere, neither is the British economy.</p> <p>There have been reports that Osborne and Cameron are looking again at what measures can be taken to stimulate growth, including airport expansion. But UK growth prospects remain limited by the state of the eurozone economy. It is expected that growth will recover somewhat in the third quarter, partly off the back of the Olympics and the wider feelgood factor.</p>",

  "<p>The world had wondered: openly, loudly, some may even say rudely, if Usain Bolt was ready. There were rumours of injury, speculation over his commitment to training, worries over his wavering form, suggestions that the triple world record holder might even be psychologically damaged \u2013 from last year's false start in the world championships final, from the car crash in June, from his defeat at the hands of his training partner Yohan Blake in Kingston, Jamaica, just five weeks ago. But when that gun went in the 100m final Bolt delivered one almighty response to anyone who had dared to question him, dared to dream of beating him.</p> <p>Crossing the line in an Olympic record of 9.63sec, the 25-year-old became the first man to defend an Olympic sprint title since Carl Lewis in 1988. Legend? Job done. What did Bolt have to say to the doubters? \"I have nothing to say,\" said the two-times Olympic champion. \"I said it on the track. All they can do is talk. I said when it comes to the championships it's all about me.\" Did he ever doubt his own ability? \"I was slightly worried about my start, so I sat in the blocks a bit, but I executed and that was the key. My coach said, 'Stop worrying about your start, your best race is at the end.'\"</p> <p>The Jamaican had to work hard for a victory in which a record seven out of eight men ran under 10 seconds but once Bolt had made up the deficit of his awkward start and drawn level alongside the four fastest men in the field it was easy for him to pull away. At 50 metres Bolt was already going away, just as his compatriot Asafa Powell dropped back, hit by injury. From thereon in the win, although tight, never looked in doubt.</p> <p>Yohan Blake, the 21-year-old world champion who had twice inflicted defeat on Bolt in recent weeks, was left fighting the two Americans alongside him to take silver. He needed to equal his personal best of 9.75 to do it. On the line Justin Gatlin timed his dip perfectly to snatch bronze from his team-mate Tyson Gay in 9.79 \u2013 a miraculous return to the sport for the 2004 Olympic champion who served a four-year suspension after testing positive for a banned substance in 2006. At the finish both Powell, the former world record holder who has never won a global title, and Gay, the second fastest man in history who has never won an Olympic medal, appeared devastated.</p> <p>Bolt's victory was emphatic and, as the evening had progressed, it had looked ever more likely. In those last few minutes on the warm-up track Bolt and Blake provided an image reminiscent of Bolt's demeanour before his 100m victory in Beijing four years ago.</p> <p>Joking about together, as though back on the training ground at their Kingston track, they were as relaxed as anyone can be ahead of such a momentous event. Playful as ever, Bolt had toyed with the TV camera that spied on them, leaping left and then right, in and out of vision with seemingly boundless energy as though the fact that he was about to attempt to defend the first of his Olympic titles was not even on his mind. In Beijing, so the story goes, he had been the same, rolling about on the floor, play-fighting with his agent.</p> <p>Earlier in the evening, in the semi- finals, Bolt had already begun to turn on the speed. Crossing the line in 9.87, the third fastest semi-finalist, Bolt wagged his finger as if to say: did you doubt me? Now you know the answer. Like a knife through butter, Bolt had run easy, languid, assured, as soon as he turned on the accelerators the competition, including Britain's Dwain Chambers, fell away unable even to hang on to his coat tails. Of all the semi-finalists, it was Bolt who looked the most comfortable. That was the giveaway. There lay the hint of what was to come. Not the time as such but the manner in which he won. Glancing right and left before leisurely crossing the line, Bolt was back in his formidable stride.</p> <p>The performance lay in sharp contrast to his first-round performance on Saturday morning that had kept onlookers guessing. The Jamaican had run the slowest winning time of all seven heats, only 10.09. The Americans blasted their way out of the blocks and powering to record speeds \u2013 first Gatlin in 9.97, and then 23-year-old Ryan Bailey in 9.88. Set against that background one could not help wondering if Bolt might be missing a trick. Some accused him of playing a poker game; others simply believed that he was not up to the job. Either way there was reasonable doubt, and a final medal prediction looked difficult to call.</p> <p>With Jamaica celebrating 50 years of independence, the national anthem already having rung out around the stadium during the medal ceremony for Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce's 100m victory, it was a Jamaica sprint double.</p> <p>Wrapped in the green, black and gold of the Jamaican flag, Bolt and Blake performed their victory lap, the older athlete paying tribute to the younger man. \"He works harder than me,\" Bolt said of the youngster known as \"The Beast\". \"He will do better next time because he was a little bit stressed this time.\" Bolt's legacy may prove to be far more than simply securing his own status as a legend. He may well have secured a golden future for generations of Jamaican sprinters.</p>",

According to a spokesman for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), eight armed men attacked while the Egyptian security guards were eating the traditional iftar meal that breaks the Ramadan fast. A further seven guards were injured.</p> <p>The militants commandeered two armoured vehicles, which they drove towards the Israeli border. According to Arab media reports, one vehicle exploded on the Egyptian side of the border, the other broke through the security fence near the Kerem Shalom border crossing and was hit by Israeli air force planes.</p> <p>Israeli government spokesman Ofir Gendelman said seven militants were killed, four on the Israeli side of the border and three in Egypt. He said Israeli soldiers were combing the area for other militants who might still be on the Israeli side of the border. The military instructed Israeli civilians to stay inside their homes.</p> <p>Defence minister Ehud Barak said the attack \"again raise[s] the need for determined Egyptian action to enforce security and prevent terror in the Sinai\", and the country's security forces had \"thwarted an attack that could have injured many\".</p> <p>Israel has become increasingly concerned about a security vacuum in the Sinai in the 18 months since the Egyptian revolution. There have been a number of attacks and attempted attacks on Israel from across the border. Israel says some militant groups in Gaza have joined forces with Islamists operating in Sinai.</p> <p>In the past year, Israel has permitted the Egyptian government to station more troops in Sinai than is allowed under the 1979 peace treaty in the hope of beefing up security.</p> <p>According to Egypt's state news agency, the attack was the responsibility of militants from Gaza who entered Egypt through the tunnels beneath the border.</p> <p>Hamas, the Islamist organisation that rules Gaza, condemned the attack. It has tried to contain militant activity since the end of its war with Israel three-and-a-half years ago. \"Hamas condemns this ugly crime which killed a number of Egyptian soldiers and extends its deep condolences to the families of the victims and to the leadership and the people of Egypt,\" it said.</p> <p>Earlier on Sunday, a militant in Gaza was killed and another injured in an Israeli air strike on a motorcycle near the Egyptian border. The IDF said it had targeted a \"global jihad-affiliated terrorist squad in the southern Gaza Strip\" which was responsible for an attack on the Israel-Egypt border in June in which an Israeli civilian was killed. Another attack was being planned, the IDF said.</p> <p>The two incidents were not connected, according to an IDF spokesman.</p>",

  "<p>In the current humanitarian emergencies in South Sudan, Somalia, Niger and Kenya, the strong likelihood is that tarpaulins \u2013 one of the most basic relief items \u2013 will have come from China.</p> <p>Tarpaulin production is concentrated in Asia (80%), where India and China are the main manufacturers, and the US (18%). More than half of India's output is used internally and the same goes for Pakistan, so China is a main source of tarpaulin for many of the world's aid agencies.</p> <p>Distant manufacturers mean long lead times for supplies to arrive and great expense \u2013 even if they are flown in from pre-positioned stocks in, say, Dubai or Europe. Providing supplies for humanitarian emergencies is a $15bn business.</p> <p>Given that Africa has more than its fair share of emergencies, some wonder why more African firms are not manufacturing emergency supplies, from tarpaulins to blankets to mosquito nets. Not only would it make sense logistically, but it would also provide manufacturing capacity and jobs in Africa.</p> <p>This was precisely what motivated David Dickie to set up <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/\" title=\"\">Advance Aid</a>, in 2006, after a career in publishing and advertising. A big believer in trade not aid, Dickie thinks it absurd to fly large amounts of aid material around the world to areas where unemployment is the highest on the planet.</p> <p>\"Aid is not working,\" Dickie said in an interview recently. \"I wanted to do things in a different way. I'm trying to turn the market on its head by creating jobs in Africa. Building this capacity in Africa will make a real difference to agencies, to the beneficiaries of the aid and to local businesses.\"</p> <p>Advance Aid made a breakthrough last year by supplying World Vision and Catholic Relief Services with non-food items. Advance Aid said it was the first time that African-produced emergency relief goods had been provided for African emergencies. The goods are bought in Kenya and more than 80% of their value will be manufactured domestically, pumping $1.5m into the economy, said Advance Aid, adding that, directly and indirectly, it had brought orders to 12 Kenyan manufacturers.</p> <p>For World Vision, Advance Aid sourced 5,000 emergency kits, each consisting of a tarpaulin, a family-size mosquito net, three blankets, a kitchen set and a hygiene kit, that enable a family of five to survive when they have lost everything in a disaster. For Catholic Relief Services, Advance Aid acquired more than 14,000 plastic jerry cans and the same number of tarpaulins. Two-thirds of the jerry cans have already gone to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/18/kenya-turn-dadaab-into-asset\" title=\"\">Dadaab, the big refugee camp near Kenya's border with Somalia</a> that is home to 465,000 refugees.</p> <p>\"I badgered World Vision and sold them the concept,\" said Dickie, who points out that procurement policies at aid agencies in recent years have worked against African manufacturers. Some of the major aid organisations such as Unicef and UNHCR have introduced <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49f6d3d26.html\" title=\"\">frame agreements</a>, typically lasting three to five years, with a supplier of goods and services. Such agreements include price guarantees, quality standards, volume and required inventory holdings.</p> <p>For aid agencies, these agreements were simpler than previous arrangements of competitive tendering in relation to individual requirements. However, few African companies have the capacity to produce supplies in the required quantities and there may be problems of quality, at least initially.</p> <p>\"These agreements are a huge drawback for small- and medium-sized African companies who lack the capital to put the necessary stock in place,\" said David Taylor, a former senior research fellow at Cardiff business school, who was commissioned by Advance Aid to write a chapter in the book, <a href=\"http://www.igi-global.com/book/relief-supply-chain-management-disasters/50516\" title=\"\">Relief supply chain management for disasters: humanitarian, aid and emergency logistics</a>.</p> <p>African producers that previously supplied products to aid agencies lost business as a result of frame agreements. One of Advance Aid's goals is to act as an intermediary between groups of African producers and big aid agencies so that African companies can produce goods locally for these agreements.</p> <p>\"Redeploying into the local economy as much as possible of the massive sums spent on humanitarian assistance is a very efficient way of bringing together the development and humanitarian agendas,\" said Dickie. \"Every Kenyan who has a job is likely to be supporting an average of six dependants, so the more people we can get into work, or keep in work, the more resilient the country will be to disasters.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.igi-global.com/book/relief-supply-chain-management-disasters/50516\" title=\"\"><em>Relief supply chain management for disasters</em></a><em>, edited by Gy\u00f6ngyi Kov\u00e1cs and Karen Spens.

  "<p>'U-sain! U-sain! U-sain!\" chanted the crowd, which seemed packed with a comical number of pasty Brits wearing Jamaican flags and facepaint. He did the lighting bolt gesture. They returned it with howls of delight.</p> <p>He may run in Jamaican colours, but it should be perfectly obvious that Usain Bolt is One of Ours. The Brits have always adored people who appear not to be trying, and there is simply no top athlete alive, not even Lionel Messi, who appears to try as little as Bolt. It is the source of his galaxy-class charm. The fastest man on the planet disports himself like a gentleman amateur. When his career comes to an end, they will retire the adjective \"effortless\".</p> <p>When Britain ruled the world, amateurs ruled sport, and while it may be quite unacceptable to rue the passing of the former, there's a nostalgic admiration for any chap who puts us in mind of the latter. If he happens to pull off that feat while being able to consistently post times that would once have seemed superhuman, the hat is formally, ecstatically doffed.</p> <p>After that almost mythical turn in Beijing, it became fashionable to inquire, with an incredulous giggle, what time Bolt would have run if he'd bothered to do up his shoelaces. If he hadn't started celebrating at the 70 metre mark. If he hadn't slowed down to have a good look about. If he'd tried. He managed a mere 9.63 in Stratford \u2013 but then, he has been under the weather this year.</p> <p>In this country, the London Olympics may have become an ensemble piece, a star-studded cast of British talent in the perfect feelgood movie.</p> <p>But for the rest of the world, only one athlete gets pre-title billing at this Games. Bolt.</p> <p>Britain is having a national moment where hard work and near-anonymous sacrifice are being joyously rewarded, and it's almost unspeakably marvellous to be celebrating the dedication of Lizzies and Heathers and Gregs, who've shivered in icy training sessions, who've feared for their funding, who've never nearly crashed their Aston Martins during a row with their agent over an extra five grand a week, and who you're convinced would be the most brilliant giggle on a night out to celebrate their medals if they'd only let you tag along and let you tell them you bloody loved them six hundred times before you all lost your coats and got everyone on the night bus home to sing Heroes.</p> <p>But something deep in the psyche is powerfully \u2013 more powerfully, I think \u2013 seduced by Bolt. Isn't he the one everybody wants to be?</p> <p>I yield to no one in my awestruck, sofabound desire to weep along with Jessica Ennis, the British face of the Games, whose astonishing achievements in this stadium only last night felt local and global, sporting and cultural. But in our hearts, in that presumably supra-orgasmic moment when he crosses a finish line, don't we all just yearn to be Usain Bolt?</p> <p>Even the hacks are mad for him, craning their cameraphones to get a souvenir snap of Bolt finally leaving the stadium after a victory lap that had included a somersault, a kiss of the track, some comic interaction with the unlovable 2012 mascot, and any number of lightning bolt gestures punctuated by uproarious laughter. He was accompanied for all of it by the puppyishly grinning silver medalist, his training partner Yohan Blake.</p> <p>I know, I know. Some phrases pull you up short when you're reading them, and \"Usain Bolt's training partner\" is one of them. \"Training partner?\" seems the only appropriate thing to shriek. \"Usain Bolt doesn't TRAIN! \u2026 Does he? I mean, doesn't he just turn up and BE USAIN BOLT?\"</p> <p>Someone once said that Fred Astaire was willing to kill himself to make his art look effortless, and you'd be mad to think that Bolt isn't toiling behind the scenes.</p> <p>But you'd be equally mad to think anyone wishes to hear about it. The popular imagination screens out the tales of Bolt's application, because it knows the story it wants to tell about him, what it wants him to mean.</p> <p>So the stories you remember are the ones about how he clean bowled Chris Gayle (he might have had a crack at being an international cricketer had he not been mildly taken with this running thing). Or how his training schedule in the weeks before the Games included crashing his BMW on the way back from a party in Jamaica at 5.15am.</p> <p>Many times during the past week, we've watched winning athletes celebrate with tears which seem so private that you feel almost a voyeur for watching them on TV.</p> <p>That's not Bolt's style, and he's worshipped for it.</p> <p>He celebrates like those of us who watch the 100m dream we'd celebrate if we won the 100m.</p>",
  "<p>Mike Thiedke was training to be a primary school teacher when a lecturer noticed his analytical skills and suggested an academic career instead. Thiedke went on to complete a PHd in children's rights and participation. The research took him to the townships of South Africa where hesaw work that he wanted to do in the field of international development. He says: \"I liked the international element of the work and if academic life wasn't enough for me I thought I could use my skills in a more practical way to help the disadvantaged.\"</p> <p>As a volunteer in the Cape Town townships Thiedke helped establish health centres in schools, working on a range of education and relief projects with young people. He says: \"I wasn't shocked by what I saw. I'm not shocked when I see people living in terrible conditions because it doesn't help them. What helps them is if I see their reality, and have a respectful relationship with them and try and see what needs to be done.\" This pragmatic approach doesn't mean that Thiedke lacks passion \u2013 he just shows it in a different way. He says: \"Lots of people are moved by a 'bleeding heart.' But pity doesn't help people. You need to truly understand the situation and find ways out of it \u2013 that's passion. I am quite an emotional person but it's about being measured about your emotion and channelling that into being practical.\"</p> <p>Thiedke's PHd included a six-month internship at the United Nations in New York which led to a job on its youth engagement programme. He then went on to become project manager for preparedness of the UN's own staff for a possible swine flu pandemic. He says: \"Originally my boss didn't want me \u2013 she wanted somebody with medical experience who knew about Avian Flu. I said that what she really needed was somebody trained in project management who had analytical skills who could get things done.\" He regards his work on the swine flu project as one of his career highlights: \"It was quite a difficult task \u2013 we started off talking about body bags and had to turn this into strategy and appraisal. But I built the plan and it's something I am proud of.\" He stayed with the UN for another two years becoming business manager for emergency planning and preparedness, before reaching a crossroads. He could either \"take the comfortable and lazy route\" and carve himself a career at the UN or seek fresh challenges. \"I had to make a personal decision \u2013 I wanted to go back to Europe and I think I was too young to get stuck in the UN system,\" he says.</p> <p>But he acknowledges it was at the UN where he honed his communication skills. \"What I learnt in that international arena was diplomatic skills and to be truly respectful in the way you engage with people \u2013 that is what you need [when you want] to convince people. I behave in a diplomatic way without being fluffy. I'm direct with people \u2013 without being rude \u2013 and that usually works. I think that's what makes a good communicator because you come across as genuine.\"</p> <p>His ticket back to Europe came as international head of child sponsorship and support for the international charity, <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Action Aid</a>. It was an organisation he had come across working in Cape Town and he liked the methods it used in the field motivating young people. \"That links back to everything I've been saying \u2013 it's all about doing something in a constructive and respectful way.\" Although he hadn't worked in fundraising before he was confident that he had the skills to lead on its flagship child sponsorship programme: \"I think fundraising requires a lot of basic skills which I had. I think I had enough for the job that I was asked to do.\" It's this confidence and tenacity \u2013 reflected in his record at the UN where he increased the number of young people on its youth participation programme 10-fold \u2013 which has stood him in good stead. In his three years at <a href=\"http://www.actionaid.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Action Aid</a> he has been interim international director of fundraising and communications and interim executive director of the charity's US division. One of his greatest achievement's there so far was identifying the \"disconnect\" between the child sponsorship programme and the rest of the charity's work and bringing the two together in a new global strategy underpinned by education and youth work.</p> <p>As he looks to the future Thiedke thinks he might go for a chief executive role or maybe return to the UN although he says: \"It's not on my radar at the moment.\" Whatever his ultimate decision, Thiedke's unswerving belief in mutual respect and that nobody is off-limits will help take him to the top. He says: \"I think it is a privilege coming from an educated background. When I came to the UN I came with the attitude that I could talk to the Secretary General \u2013 there is nothing that makes that impossible \u2013 he is an interesting man and I have something to say. Then I find myself having coffee with Kofi Annan \u2013 I don't have boundaries. It's not disrespectful. You might call it naivety. Back then I was in my youth, but I am now in my late 30s and I'm still doing the same thing.\"</p> <p><em>Mike Thiedke was named Charity Voice 2012 in the annual award organised by PR company Porter Novelli and the Media Trust charity.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
