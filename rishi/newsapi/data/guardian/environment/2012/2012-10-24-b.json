  "<p>A new fund of \u00a350m to create calming environments for people with dementia, which aid treatment by helping sufferers to avoid confusion, will be announced on Thursday by the health secretary Jeremy Hunt.</p> <p>The money will be available to NHS trusts and local authorities working in partnership with social care providers to help tailor hospitals and care homes to the needs of those with dementia.</p> <p>Hunt's aides claim that the announcement puts the care of sufferers at the heart of his priorities in a week when abusive workers from Winterbourne View care home are sentenced for assaulting elderly and frail patients.</p> <p>But critics point out that the money will make an insignificant impact upon the key problem within the sector. It does not address long term funding for thousands of sufferers who need constant care but are increasingly left to fend for themselves in the private sector.</p> <p>Hunt said that the announcement will have a real impact upon the lives of patients across the country.</p> <p>\"Being one of the best for dementia is a priority for this government, and doing what we can to help people with the condition feel more safe and secure in their environment is an important part of this.</p> <p>\"Responding with dignity and compassion to dementia is the only sensible reaction to the urgent challenges we face as our population ages,\" he said.</p> <p>The money will be used to expand the range of care services offering dedicated dementia-friendly environments, and to promote further use of design techniques to help the growing number of people with dementia get the best possible care.</p> <p>Options for the money include specially-designed rooms that include hi-tech sensory rooms using lighting, smells and sound to stimulate those with dementia, or specially-adapted outside space to prevent patients from wandering.</p> <p>It could also fund technology such as controllable mood lighting to simulate day and night, which help people with dementia stay independent and well-cared for, or pay for calming colours and large-print signs to help residents know where they are and find their way back to their room.</p> <p>Research by The King's Fund has shown that cluttered ward layouts and poor signage in hospitals and care homes were the top reasons for causing confusion and distress in people with dementia.</p> <p>Taking steps such as using a particular colour scheme, creating a designated quiet space or establishing a gardening patch significantly helped to reduce patient distress and assisted with the management of the condition.</p> <p>Funding will go to NHS Trusts and local authorities working in partnership with social care providers to make improvements. But the money will only be awarded if care providers sign up to the Dementia Care and Support Compact, which commits them to providing first rate care and support for people with dementia and their families.</p>",
  "<p>Britain should focus less on creating a viable state in Afghanistan and seek to work at a local level to deliver \"measurable benefits\" for people, MPs said on Thursday.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/international-development-committee/news/afghanistan-report-published---press-notice/\" title=\"\">a grim report looking at Afghanistan's development prospects after 2014</a>, when western combat troops are set to withdraw, the international development committee said the priority of state-building may not be attainable when there are so many factors at play, such as the situation in neighbouring Pakistan.</p> <p>\"This priority set for the Department for International Development (DfID) may become harder, if not impossible to work towards in the absence of a political settlement and if the security situation deteriorates further,\" said the report.</p> <p>MPs said DfID should instead give greater emphasis to providing services and alleviating poverty. The report said the department's evaluation in 2009 found that its most successful work was on small-scale rural development and not large-scale government projects.</p> <p>\"We recommend that DfID be prepared, as Afghanistan moves closer to 2014, to be able to shift the focus of its governance programme away from consultants in Kabul towards helping the Afghan government deliver basic services at a local level,\" said the report. It urged DfID to encourage other major donors to keep up their aid programmes so that there would be no sudden drops in funding that might exacerbate an already fragile situation.</p> <p>\"The Afghan people want their country to succeed, and the UK should continue to support them with a major aid budget in the country after the troops leave,\" said Malcolm Bruce, the committee chairman. \"It is questionable whether DfID has the capacity to build a viable state but we should be able to deliver effective development.\"</p> <p>Since 2001, donors are estimated to have devoted nearly $30bn (\u00a319bn) in development and humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, and the volume of aid has risen each year. Afghanistan is the world's largest recipient of official development assistance; 71% of its gross domestic product is funded by foreign aid. Military aid of $243bn, however, dwarfs humanitarian and development programmes.</p> <p>The UK is Afghanistan's third biggest donor, behind the US and EU institutions. <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Where-we-work/Asia-South/Afghanistan/\" title=\"\">DfID has committed \u00a3178m annually up to 2014-15</a>, having increased spending in 2010 by 40%. The programme's three objectives are improving security and stability; stimulating economic growth and job creation; and helping deliver basic services. The UK also has a 10-year partnership arrangement on poverty reduction and aid effectiveness.</p> <p>The large amounts of foreign aid have led to some improvements. More than five million children attend school, compared with 1 million in 2001 under the Taliban, and mortality rates for children under five have fallen by 40%. But the country remains one of the world's poorest, with an estimated 9 million Afghans (about a third of the population) living in poverty (according to the World Bank definition of a person living on less than $1.25 a day). An estimated 5.4 million Afghans lack access to health services, 4.4 million of whom are women.</p> <p>The report noted a host of problems with the massive aid effort. Most of it bypasses the Afghan government, limiting its ability to build public services and strengthen governance systems. Yet even when aid is delivered through the government, it lacks the capacity to absorb it, spending only an estimated 18-20% of the aid it receives from the US.</p> <p>Dovetailing aid \u2013 a running sore in development \u2013 is particularly acute in Afghanistan. \"Co-ordination among donors, all with different priorities, has been a significant obstacle as it has led to poorly co-ordinated or ill-advised projects,\" said the report. \"Implementation of aid projects on the ground has often been fragmented among donors with complex structures.\"</p> <p>The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), an independent watchdog, has raised concerns about the financial management of British projects. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/22/uk-aid-afghanistan-overseen-more-effectively\" title=\"\">In March, ICAI gave the Afghanistan aid programme an amber-red mark</a>, signifying that the scheme is \"not performing well\" and needs \"significant improvements\".</p> <p>MPs found a gap between DfID's rhetoric and its actions in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/25/treatment-afghanistan-women-test-uk-aid\" title=\"\">advancing the cause of women</a>. The committee said it found little evidence to back up the UK government's claims that it is committed to protecting and promoting the rights of women and girls. \"DfID could be doing a lot more to help support women in Afghanistan,\" said Bruce. \"The department should start by examining what programmes have been effective for women in Afghanistan, then draw up a plan to expand these programmes, while doing all it can to secure commitments from other donors.\"</p> <p>A DfID spokesman agreed women's rights should be at the heart of its work in Afghanistan, adding that UK funding has helped get 2.2 million girls into school and its \u00a319.5m Tawanmandi civil society programme is providing more than half its grants to women's organisations. \"Preventing sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict countries is a priority across government which is why, last month, the foreign secretary [William Hague] announced \u00a31m to support the UN on <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?id=815183582&amp;view=News\" title=\"\">sexual violence in conflict</a>,\" said the spokesman.</p> <p>ActionAid estimates that $90m is needed for the Afghan government to tackle the problem of violence against women, pointing out that Australia has already committed $17m towards this. The NGO said: \"It is time for the UK government to put its money where its mouth is when it comes to supporting women in Afghanistan and make a sizeable new financial commitment to help end the shocking abuse of women.\"</p>",

At least one of those investors, Paul Singer, managed at least $1 million from a blind trust belonging to Ann Romney.</p> <p>When the bailout worked for Delphi, Singer made money and the Romneys made money, Palast writes. If the Romneys did not know about their investment in Delphi, Palast writes, they should have figured it out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nevertheless, even if the Romneys were blind to their initial investment in Elliott [Singer's hedge fund], they would have known by the beginning of 2010 that they had a massive position in Delphi and would make a fortune from the bailout and TARP funds. Delphi is not a minor investment for Singer; it is his main holding. To invest in Elliott is essentially a \u201cDelphi play\u201d: that is, investing with Singer means buying a piece of the auto bailout.</p> </blockquote> <p>Palast lays out the case in an interview with Democracy Now <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/18/greg_palast_mitt_romneys_bailout_bonanza\">here</a>. The Romney campaign replied to the report in <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/transportation-report/automobiles/262839-report-romney-profited-153-million-on-auto-bailout-\">The Hill</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Romney's campaign did not deny that he profited from the auto bailout in an email to The Hill Wednesday afternoon, but it said the the report showed the Detroit intervention was \"misguided.\"</p> <p>\"The report states that Delphi had 29 US plants before the misguided Obama auto bailout, and just four after. Is this really what the president views as success,\" Romney spokeswoman Michele Davis said.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney would have taken a different path to turning around the auto industry,\" Davis continued. \"As President, Mitt Romney will create jobs and give American workers the recovery they deserve.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T22:04:54.151Z\">at 11.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088595895cb4897f0db5298\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T21:10:48.540Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a> calls<strong> Donald Trump's office</strong> to ask for his college records and passport records.

But campaigns depend on the media to get their messages out. A quid pro quo develops. Campaigns trade access for coverage. What's strange is when a campaign asks for coverage but wants the access part to be invisible. Case in point: asking for a newspaper endorsement based on an off-the-record conversation.</p> <p>President Obama agreed to speak with the Des Moines Register this week about the election and why the paper should endorse him. But then the White House made the conversation off the record.</p> <p>The story might have ended there, with the Register editors deciding to endorse without ever releasing the nature of their conversation with the president.</p> <p>But Register editor Rick Green wrote a <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/OPINION/121024001/Register-editor-Obama-off-record-comments-deserve-shared-voters?nclick_check=1\">blog post</a> Tuesday evening about the strange stipulation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president\u2019s vision for a second term. He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection. [...]</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we discussed was off-the-record. It was a condition, we were told, set by the White House. [...]</p> <p>We requested that the White House be asked to reverse course so whatever the president shared with us could be reviewed by voters and our readers.</p> <p>No reason was given for the unusual condition of keeping it private.</p> <p>We relented and took the call. How could we not? It\u2019s the leader of the free world on line one.</p> </blockquote> <p>Green's post caught the attention of Register readers and other media outlets. Speculation cropped up that the president had said something the White House did not want to be released. Questions about the off-the-record condition threatened to eclipse whatever impact an endorsement might have. There was the uncomfortable fact that Governor Romney had conducted an extensive, hourlong interview with the paper that he allowed <a href=\"http://bcove.me/bin26964\">to be filmed</a>.</p> <p>The White House then suddenly reversed course, conceding to the newpaper's request to release details of the conversation. The paper published the <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/NEWS09/121024003/After-editor-s-blog-President-Obama-releases-transcript-of-Register-interview?Frontpage\">transcript of the conversation</a> online today.</p> <p>The bombshell in the transcript? No bombshell. Obama said a couple things slightly differently than he has said them before.

  "<p>It was a small point of law, well-spotted by the lawyers, but it may have changed the landscape \u2013 the equivalent of the <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/237038\" title=\"\">cloud no bigger than a man's hand</a> that grows into a storm. On Wednesday, the supreme court ruled that some out-of-time equal pay claims could come before the civil courts. It could, at last, be the moment when local authorities abandon the hopeless cause of resisting equal pay claims. It is a critical victory, but it is not the end of the war. The new battleground is the private sector, where those women who escape from lower-paid jobs are, according to <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/tucfiles/251.pdf\" title=\"\">TUC research</a>, penalised by a gender pay gap twice as big as it is in the public sector.</p> <p>Since the Equal Pay Act came in more than 40 years ago, it had seemed that the six-month cut-off point for unfair pay claims heard by employment tribunals was unbreachable. As a result, hundreds of thousands of women missed their chance of justice. The ruling that cases beyond the six-month limit could, after all, be heard in the civil court makes it possible to launch claims up to six years after leaving an employer. That delivers a deserved windfall to the low-paid cleaners, cooks and care assistants of Birmingham who retired or left before the council recognised their rights, and it also opens up the chance for thousands more women reluctant to challenge discriminatory employers while they still work for them, or in the same sector. Meanwhile, Birmingham, at a time of desperate cuts, is left with a huge bill for fighting and losing a battle it should have conceded years ago.</p> <p>The Equal Pay Act was a grand gesture in the dying days of a failing Labour government. Designing legislation that would successfully change the way people behaved was a novelty and its passage was a stitch-up between patriarchal unions and patriarchal employers. A five-year gap before implementation was meant to allow employers to equalise pay. Instead it allowed thousands of jobs to be reassigned to women only, perpetuating the undervaluation of women's work. Fighting cases is tricky, because an individual rather than a trade union or the equalities commission has to bring the case. The process was made worse by job segregation, because it made it near impossible to find a comparator to prove men got more for doing similar work. Where attempts have been made to make the law work better, they've been piecemeal: amendment on amendment, overlaid by EU law to produce something so dense that it's incomprehensible to all but specialist lawyers. Above all, the law is about providing a remedy when it has been broken, not about trying to shape the environment to encourage compliance. And when finally a serious attempt at reform was made, it again came at the end of a Labour government heading for defeat. The Equalities Act 2010 repeats its predecessor's mistakes. Its postdated proposals for pay transparency lie unimplemented and ignored by the coalition.</p> <p>Yet, although the women who marched on parliament on Wednesday<a href=\"http://ukfeminista.org.uk/events/feminist-lobby-of-parliament/\" title=\"\">under the UK Feminista banner</a> rightly protest at the distance still to travel before women are treated equally, the world is transformed since equal pay law was first introduced. Nearly as many women as men now work. The pay gap <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/economics/2012/07/were-solving-pay-gap-wrong-way?destination=node%2F187943\" title=\"\">is better understood</a>. It can be seen to be clearly linked to events in women's lives \u2013 motherhood, caring responsibilities, an interrupted work record (nearly half of all low-paid women earn even less when they return to work). And last year the pay gap for workers on median hourly pay was actually narrower than it has ever been.</p> <p>Hold the cheers. It is true that women's pay has been rising faster than men's, but that's not as exciting as it sounds. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/economics/2012/07/were-solving-pay-gap-wrong-way?destination=node%2F187943\" title=\"\">Men's pay is static,</a> and fathers' pay has actually fallen as more men work part-time. Families are faring worse than other groups. The parent penalty is falling more equally, but that just means more children are in poverty. Affordable childcare and higher-quality part-time work are at last issues for men as well as women. A new equality is emerging, but it's an equality of misery.</p>",
  "<p>Some people are claiming this as a week in which the government's U-turns hit triple figures before we even got to Wednesday. This is a bit rich. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/23/badger-cull-postponed-2013\" title=\"\">Badgers stopped holding their breath on Tuesday</a>, and the decision to un-close, or consider un-closing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/22/jeremy-hunt-closure-childrens-heart-units\" title=\"\">children's heart units</a> came on Monday. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-live-reaction\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell, though, was toast by Friday</a>, so really it's three U-turns spanning two weeks.</p> <p>But the debate is not about whether they got lucky on the calendar, but whether to call this a U-turn. Tories insist that these are actually postponements, or halts, or pauses. If you consider the behaviour in the terms of the driving metaphor whence the image came, a U-turn would be by far the best thing to do: you changed your mind, but&#xa0;at least you were decisive and&#xa0;didn't&#xa0;just sit in the middle of the road, annoying everyone.</p> <p>However, the entire concept is understood in Westminster as being far larger than simply changing your mind. The act of U-turning is thought to convey disarray and incompetence; a lack of control and internecine infighting; crucially, a failure of mettle at the most fundamental level; a failure to be Margaret Thatcher, and therefore a failure to create an atmosphere of government in which its sagacity on individual matters has ceased to be questioned, as its fitness to govern has been accepted as fact. Put like that, it doesn't look good. And yet, I think this is a lobbyist's fallacy. To a normal person, changing one's mind following reasonable, sustained argumentation from a number of reputable sources is not a sign of weakness, it's just a sign that you're awake.</p> <p>However, there I go, conjuring up the \"normal person\"; following Mitchell's demise, plenty on his side insisted that the \"normal person\" didn't care what he'd said to a policeman. The normal person (I'm going to give over with the inverted commas, you've got the message) didn't know that \"pleb\" was a snobbish word, he or she just assumed it meant \"moron\"; the normal person couldn't pick George Osborne, let alone Mitchell, out of a lineup; and polls, furthermore, proved as much.</p> <p>You can split hairs about this. Some polls thought he should resign, some didn't; 90% of Sun readers thought he should go from the off, so you can make of that what you will (here's what I make of it: in Cameron's shoes, Tony Blair would have fired him immediately. But I didn't like that modus operandi either. In an ideal world there'd be some middle ground between reacting immediately to anything a tabloid said and holding on to your position for dear life, until someone had to prise your fingers off it, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Last!\" title=\"\">Harold Lloyd</a>).</p> <p>Or you could say, that's not the point. Mitchell had to go not because he was uppermost in the public mind but because he is a snob. You can't govern people you despise. The problem isn't his public face, it's what's going on behind his face. In other words, it doesn't matter what the normal person thinks, if the answer is the normal person hasn't thought about it very much; there are plenty of aspects of government that normal people haven't given much thought to, but are nevertheless vital to the way things are run and have a defining impact on many normal lives.</p> <p>As Stuart Hall has said, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/feb/11/saturday-interview-stuart-hall\" title=\"\">\"Politicians always talk about what the people feel, but there is no such thing as a 'the people'. It's a discursive device for summoning the people that you want.\"</a></p> <p>In fairness, most people use the device as a last resort, when the decision&#xa0;has already gone against them \u2013 so what that Mitchell resigned? You may think you've won, but normal people don't care. It both summons the \"normal\", and insults the victor with abnormality, which they don't mind, because they've already won.</p> <p>Politicians and commentators seeking to swing an issue before it's been decided usually try to refine their definitions, with the deployment of some judiciously chosen apolitical traits \u2013 so they might address themselves to strivers or the hardworking; to mothers or parents; to women or \"grown-up\" women. (This is an old school Tory favourite: \"grown-up women don't need you telling them what to do for their childcare arrangements\", they say, when you suggest that cutting the childcare allowance might cause hardship. However poor you are, if you are a proper grown-up, you put your desire not to be patronised above your desire to pay your rent. Apparently.)</p> <p>What we're really looking at is a crisis of authority, a creed of \"I'm their leader, I must follow them\". The crucial problem with normal people \u2013 along with hardworking families and grown-up women \u2013 is that they don't all agree. Nobody knows what normal people think about U-turns, or about Mitchell, or about heart hospitals. You can poll them, interpret the results, appropriate their answers, mimic rhetorically what you think is in their hearts, and all you'll have is a circuitous route to looking even more craven than you did before. Better by far to say, I don't care what normal people think; I'm relatively normal, and this is what I think.</p> <p>Badgers are a bit different, of course. All normal people care about badgers.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Chaos in the Greek parliament following a row over the country's revised bailout plan brought fresh gloom to the eurozone as figures showed the currency union moving closer to recession.</p> <p>The Greek finance minister was forced to drop claims that he had secured a two-year extension for debt repayments and an agreement with creditors over \u20ac13.5bn (\u00a310.9bn) of proposed austerity measures when he addressed MPs on Wednesday.</p> <p>Yannis Stournaras had previously told MPs that a deal was ready, only to later admit that negotiators had yet to approve a final draft. The U-turn, which Stournaras was forced to admit after Germany denied any deal, triggered chaotic scenes in parliament as opposition MPs objected to proposed tax rises and job cuts.</p> <p>It was unclear last night whether the government will be able to submit two separate bills on austerity cuts and labour reforms due to be debated in parliament next week.</p> <p>Greece has spent months in talks with its creditors, headed by the troika of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union.</p> <p>Stournaras wants Greece to cut its debt pile by reducing the interest and extending the term of its bailout loans. Analysts still expect Athens to win improved loan terms, though not until it relinquishes more supervisory powers to the troika, which wants to closely monitor any deal.</p> <p>One Greek official said the troika would need to back down over demands for tough labour laws or risk a political revolt.</p> <p>\"Even if the troika give us a negative report, what are they going to do? Are they really going to not give us the instalment [to keep Greece's economy afloat] two weeks before the US elections, with everything that entails \u2013 default, bankruptcy, global market turmoil?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"These labour reforms will turn our country into Bangladesh. They have no fiscal benefit and will actually derail the adjustment programme. The political system will collapse if we impose them.</p> <p>\"The troika is demanding that we commit suicide, which is why we believe this is a matter that should be solved on a political level by the prime minister and not with the troika.\"</p> <p>Stournaras was forced into his U-turn after the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, told reporters in Berlin that a deal would be impossible until the troika concluded its report.</p> <p>Sch\u00e4uble, who is a key architect of the austerity measures dominating Europe's economic landscape, warned that the eurozone's finance ministers must also read the report before agreeing to the two-year loan extension called for by the Greek government.</p> <p>The failure to settle the long-running dispute in Greece over the terms of its second bailout came as the latest data showed other eurozone economies worsening.</p> <p>Factory output plunged in Germany, Europe's top economy and exporter, matching deteriorating conditions elsewhere that suggested the downturn will accelerate over the last quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The financial data provider Markit said its eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 45.8 in October, its lowest reading since June 2009. The index has now been below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since February.</p> <p>Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist, said the eurozone was heading for recession. \"The PMIs are running at levels in the third quarter and start of the fourth quarter historically consistent with GDP falling at about 0.6%,\" he said.</p> <p>A decline in manufacturing output in Europe was offset by figures from the US and China showing the world's top two economies recovering from a poor summer.</p> <p>A survey of Chinese manufacturers showed output shrank for a 12th straight month, but at the slowest rate for three years and order books were their most robust since April.</p> <p>Manufacturing grew in the US, edging up to 51.3, said Markit. But falling overseas demand and uncertainty surrounding the US elections and fiscal policy suggested the sector's recent struggles would continue in the months ahead.</p> <p>Many US companies have reported lower earnings for the quarter, hit by lack of demand and slower global growth.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><br>Ajax have been champions of Europe four times. Which makes those three primary school-style stars on Manchester City's jersey seem a celebration of piffle. But this is not, of course, the Ajax of yore; rather, similar to Greek mythologists, we must distinguish between Ajax the Great and the current outfit, Ajax the Lesser. If my comprehensive knowledge of the classics (read: hasty consultation of a well-known web-based encyclopedia) is anything to go by, Ajax the Lesser had impressive potential, pulled off some marvelous feats but, ultimately, began to believe he was better than he really was and perished through his own hubris, drowning while attempting to walk on water. There could be a significant omen in there for this Ajax side ahead of tonight's encounter with the far better-resourced City. On the other hand, this opening could be complete waffle, in which case try the next paragraph instead. </p> <p>Right then. Fail to win here and City are as good as out of the Champions League at the first stage, again. And serial European flop Roberto Mancini could be as good as out of a job. Win here and City will live on to be outplayed by Real and Dortmund again before being knocked out. No English team is going to win the Champions League this year, are they? </p> <p><strong>Teams: </strong><br><strong>Ajax the Lesser:</strong> Vermeer; Van Rhijn, Aldenweireld, Moisander, Blind; Schone, Poulsen, Eriksen; Sana, De Jong, Twitter's Ryan Babel<br>Subs: Cillessen, Enoh, Sulemani, Boerrigter, Veltman, Dijks, Fischer<br><strong><br>City:</strong> Hart; Richards, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy; Milner, Tour\u00e9, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Pantilimon, Sinclair, Kolarov, Tevez, Nastasic, Balotlli, Evans</p> <p><strong>Ref: </strong>S Moen (Norway)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Mancini explains his selections:</strong> \"We had a players who spent a lot of energy on Saturday because we played for 70 minutes with one player down so I need fresh players for tonight.\" He also explains that Pablo Zabaleta is not fit but should be OK for Saturday; and that he reckons his team could be particularly dangerous form set-pieces tonight.\"</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.37pm: \"As an Ajax fan, while I certainly agree that this is indeed Ajax the Lesser, I don't think Ajax thought it was better than it really was (although that is indeed a real Ajax quality),\" howls Simon Broekema, who has misunderstood my intricately-compiled analogy. \"Rather, the Bosman ruling made it extremely difficult for Ajax to hold on to the talented players they had either grown themselves or scouted successfully. May I remind you that if you could make any team now featuring former Ajax players, that team would feature players like Sneijder, Van der Vaart, Nigel de Jong, Huntelaar, Ibrahimovic and Suarez. In any case, the Lesser Ajax is now a team full of young puppies, and they are unfortunately going to get destroyed tonight.\" That last bit is what I was driving at: they may have bitten off more than they can chew with this Champions League campaign.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>Aside: As yet another ad for the latest James Bond movie blazes across my screen, I would like to formally register my disdain for this sort of thing. This ubiquitous marketing campaign for the new film, all designed to convey the notion that this release is some kind of vital cultural event, has put me right off seeing it. As has the fact that the last, ooooh, at least five Bond movies have been increasingly atrocious. Casino Royale was a nadir. Pure dross. And a poker scene shoehorned in to chime with the times but which, alas, made no sense whatsoever.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>7.43pm: Anyway, speaking of vital cultural events, we've just had the Champions League theme. Always makes the hairs on the palms of my hands stand up.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> City kick off, and within second hoof the ball long towards Dzeko. A sign of things to come? Ajax deal with it easily.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Ajax are endeavouring to play their usual brand of slick and expansive football but it's all a bit patchy so far, and City haven't shown much either. Indeed, they have had little of the ball. In other news, here's <a href=\"http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2012/Oct/rio-and-anton-ferdinand-issue-statement.aspx\">a statement from Rio and Anton Ferdinand about matters you may have heard of</a>.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Ajax are looking the more coherent. A nice one-two twixt Babel and De Jong concludes with the latter curling a shot well over the bar from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Ajax give the ball away in midfield, granting City a chance to come forward for the first time in the game. Do they try to build a meaningful attack? No, Dzeko tries to smash the ball into the net from 35 yards. And fails miserably, his feeble effort trickling harmlessly wide. \"You are lucky, Paul: we have incessant ads for who will make the best president, senator, congressman, dog catcher, floor sweeper et al,\" groans Geoff Ashworth, who presumably lives in Gambia.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Lovely effort! Again City were guilty of being too meek as Ajax played their way skilfully through them. They worked it quickly to Schone at the edge of the City box and the Dane fed it back to Eriksen, who cracked a vicious volley inches wide from 20 yards. Hart wouldn't have got to that.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> The Champions League is all about clashes between the planet's biggest stars. So I should tell you that the big Christian Poulsen-Gareth Barry duel has been pretty even so far.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> City build a threatening more for the first time, with Aguero heavily involved. After his team zip the ball about with more speed and purpose than they had previously summoned, the Argentinian tried to skedaddle his way into the box ... and he would have gotten away with it too, if it not for some excellent meddling by Alderweireld at the edge of the box.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Here's a worry: Yaya Tour\u00e9 is down injured. The replay does not reveal anything particularly damaging in the challenge by Blind so Tour\u00e9 may be able to continue. \"When I hear the injured players left behind are mostly the new ones, am I the only City fan who feels relieved they're not there and Mancini's got less choice about sticking with what's worked in the past?\" barks Paul Ruffley. City sure done botched their summer recruitment.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> This Ajax may be The Lesser compared to their Great forefathers, but they're currently a good deal better than City, for whom, at least, Tour\u00e9 has just returned to the pitch after getting his ankle strapped.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> As Ajax continue to circulate the ball nicely around a desperately passive City side, Gary Neville is asked by fellow Sky commentator about his memories of playing against Ryan Babel. \"I remember that whenever the ball came to his feet he seemed to be having an argument with it.\" Gary Neville, a prince among pundits!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Eriksen, playing as a false nine, is becoming ever more influential and executing some delicious moves. He just intigated another flowing Ajax attack before arriving at the end of it to flummox Barry before firing just wide from 20 yards.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 0-1 City (Nasri 22')</strong> City score with a splendid counter-attack, their first of the game! Richards began it with an excellent pass to Milner, who slid it wide to Nasri, who, having charged in unmarked from the left, struck it first time past the keeper and into the corner of the goal form 17 yards. A classic sucker punch.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> The match has quickly reverted to its pre-City goal pattern, with Ajax dominating play but showing little hint of a cutting edge. \" Come on Paul, I'm no Alan Partridge-level Bond devotee but, surely, Casino Royale -with a proper, gritty actor at its heart - was better than prety much all Brosnan Bonds!\" fumes Ryan Dunne. No! There was something about Brosnan that made it clear he knew how preposterous the Bond wheeze was. Not nearly as much as the brilliant Roger Moore, who always looked like he was trying to suppress a laugh and never looked like he could really beat anyone up, let alone a villain hellbent on global destruction. Daniel Craig seems to take it too seriously.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Ajax look quite ragged at the back when City do go at them. A routine move down the right suddenly results in Richards cantering into the box with a free shot on goal. He blems it hard but straight the keeper, who bats it away.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Nasri over-hits an intended pass to Aguero. If he'd got it right, the striker would have been in for number two.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> De Jong sweeps a fine cross-field ball to Van Rhijn, who has got in down the right behind Clichy. But then he loses the head and sends a curler over the bar when a pass to a well-placed team-mate would have been a wiser option. \"Kolarov must wonder what he has to do to get a start over Clichy (who has been poor so far this season), especially after his masterful display against Sunderland,\" parps Daniel Field. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see him heading back to Italy soon.\" Who would match his wages?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> City rumble forward again after absorbing lots of impotent Ajax possession. Milner finds Nasri in space on the left again but Van Rhijn gets across quickly to block the Frenchman's attempted cross-shot.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Ajax eschew an opportunity to send a cross into the box and instead take a short freekick from 30 yards. And then Schone dinks the ball straight into Hart's hands. Elsewhere in this group, Dortmund have just taken the lead against Madrid. Probably not what City want.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Schone has a whack from 25 yards. Into a canal it goes. Meanwhile, Ronaldo has just equalised for Madrid against Dortmund. \"The trouble with Bond movies is that they cannot make up their mind if they are serious films or not,\" sermonises Simon McMahon. \"Bond as depicted in the Fleming novels is a hard, unsympathetic character, whereas Bond on screen, and Daniel Craig in particular, is caught between portraying a serious role whilst having to put up with the inevitable one-liners and product placement. Connery remains the original and best, however.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Ajax continue to enjoy the majority of possession but have yet to look truly dangerous. \"Now, I've not bothered sitting through a Bond film since the one with the evil media mogul on a ship, but I'm pretty sure I would expect a poker scene in a film with Casino in the title,\" barfs Matt Dony. \"Wouldn't it have been odder to not have any gambling in it?\" Yes, but the scene itself made no sense, as in the dynamics of the game were wrong.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 1-1 City (De Jong 45')</strong> Did I say impotent Ajax attack? Not that time! Van Rhijn fired a cross to the edge of the area, where De Jong arrived at speed to batter a low shot into the net. Hart barely moved.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Ajax did not look capable of cutting City for most of that half but the moral of their fine equaliser is that if you let a side play around you for long enough, they will eventually punish you. City need to be more assertive in the second half; but Manicni will probably continue to try absorbing Ajax's pressure and strike on the counter-attack. It may work. But being bolder is more likely to bring joy here, in my opinion.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Bond blather:</strong> \"What English footballer could play James Bond?\" wodners Justin Kavanagh. \"There aren't many suave enough: Bobby Moore in his pomp maybe? Steve Gerrard's too scouse. David Beckham is too Hollywood. Gary Neville might be wry enough, but that high-pitched orgasmic reaction to the Torres goal might turn off women fans of Bond. The villain of course would have to be a Johnnie Foreigner with schemes of world domination, maybe a Johan Cruyff, pontificating on the state of the global game from his Barcelona lair.\" Ray Wilkins or Micah Richards would get my vote.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> \"City brought this on themselves,\" blasts Michiel Jongsma. \"Leaving their left back position completely exposed and no urge trying to kill off the game after that first goal... I don't know what they're doing. Ajax have been fragile mentally all season, drawing five games from nine in the league, throwing away two goal leads and stuff. If City won't take all three points, they have only themselves to blame.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> That's more like it from City! RIght from the resumption they tear forward, Nasri threading a pass through to Aguero. A fine tackle by Moisander thwarted his first shot and then the Argentinian clipped a cross into the centre but Ajax scrambled it away again.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Pleasingly, there is a higher pace to proceedings in this second half. Looks like Manci0ni has given his troops what for. Proper order. But will they sustain it? \"Danny Murphy would be a perfect Bond,\" trumpets Matt Dony. \"He would be sent by M (Karren Brady) to nullify the threat caused by Platini's evil schemes to wipe out the classic English footballing traditions of getting clubs into insanely deep debt and tackling like psychopaths. Along the way, Danielle Lloyd would try and catch his eye, then try to kill him, but one of Q's gadgets ( Joseph Barton) would see her off.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> City enjoy their longest unbroken spell of possession of the match. It ends when Nasri swipes the ball down the left for Dzeko to chase; the Bosnia gets there and fires in a decent cross that Barry nods wide from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Hats claims a corner with authority. Moments later City are down the other end threatening again, with even Tour\u00e9 getting involved around the opposing box, which he had singularly failed to do in the first half. City have certainly improved in this period.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Nasri escapes a booking despite a late tackle on Van Rhijn. So does Milner moments later (for a foul on Eriksen). In other news, my inbox is creaking under the volume of emails demanding that Scott Parker be hired to play Bond with immediate effect.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 2-1 City (Moisander 56')</strong> This is shoddy from City! Concding the corner in the first place was slack but their attempt to defend it was worse, as no one was near Moisander as he rose near the front post and directed a powerful downward header into the net!</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Milner attempts to recreate Tom Cleverley's cross for Javier Hernandez's second goal last night but Ajax defend it better than Braga did, as Van Rhijn heads behind for a corner. And that corner is then defended well too. City have got themelves into a right old pickle here. \"George Best could have played Bond,\" bugles Travis Dudfield. \"Sure, he was from Northern Ireland but who else had or has that kind of swagger?\" If we're broadening it out to include non-Englishmen (and why shouldn't we, given that Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan have played him), then my vote goes to Paolo Di Canio.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Dzeko penalised for leaping with the goalkeeper in a bid to connect with a loopy Nasri cross. Meanwhile, the Amsterdam Arena is rocking. \"If City fail to win this game (and thereby seriously endanger their chances of getting out of this group) because they, in stereotypical Italian fashion, lounged back on a designer divan on the edge of their own box after going 1-0 up with their first shot on target in the game, then Mancini's gonna seriously cop it,\" declares SB Tang, who's not wrong.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>City substitution: </strong> Looks like Mancini is going to switch to a back three: off comes Lescott, on comes Kolarov. Meanwhile, Tevez and Balotelli remains on the bench. Clichy is not looking best pleased about this defensive realignment and, it must be said, it hasn't worked very well previously this season.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> That's a delicious cross from the left from Kolarov. Milner throws himself at it but can't keeper his header down. \"For an English James Bond, look no further than Teddy Sheringham,\" blurts Tobin Druce, who has a point.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Now Ajax are sitting back, allowing City the ball around mid-way ... until Richards gives it away to Babel, who hurtles forward. Kompany gets back to tidy things up.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Ajax 3-1 City (Eriksen 68') </strong> City are in serious trouble! Barry ceded possession deep inside City territory and Sana helped the ball on to Eriksen, who shot from 20 yards takes a treacherous deflection off Clichy and wrongfoots Hart.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> The switch to three at the back has made a rabble of City, who nearly concede a fourth. Hart saves them, surging off his line to charge down a Sana shot after City were cut apart by a quick one-two. Moments later a long ball from the back flies over Ajax heads and into the path of Dzeko. It's Vermeer's turns to pull off a fine save.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>City substitution:</strong> Tevez on, Barry off.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Suddenly this game is wackily open! Dzeko twists his way into the box at one hand, beats the keeper but finds himself at too acute an angle to score so manoeuvres himself to a more conducive position, enabling Vermeer to recover and make another crucial block. Then Ajax break down the other end and Babel's low shot from the left is held by Hart.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Ajax switch:</strong> Sana off, Enoh on. Ajax are trying to shore up this lead.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Kolarov bnooked for an immoral challenge on Schone.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Nasri takes the ball down with a beautiful touch inside the Ajaax box but then falls over under a challenge from Moisander. Nothing doing, says the ref. Meanwhile, Mancini appears to have rejigged his defence again as his team switch to a Hail Mary formation. Meanwhile, Simon McMahon is back with a suggestion for a Bond-sinspired post-match interview. \"If it stays like this I'm hoping that Mancini's post match interview goes something like this: Mancini - 'Do you expect me to talk?'. Interviewer - 'No, Mr Mancini, I expect you to cry.'</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Balotelli is now on the pitch, in place of Milner. \"Two things,\" booms HT. \"Surely Berba's your Bond? Also, a propos foreigners, a bit disappointed with SB Tang's tasteless Italian bashing, has he forgotten Napoli or Juve against Chelsea, to name recent examples?\" Why do you think SB Tang is a foreigner?</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Freekick to City close to the corner flag on the right. Kolarov clatters it towards the near post. Vermeer punches it clear and Schone tonks it further away. It's not looking good for City.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> City dink the ball around their own half for a while, looking vainly for options. None occur to them, so Nasri lofts it long into the box. Something nearly comes of it as Dzeko nods it down to Aguero, who tries to wriggle his way into a shooting position but is eventually crowded out.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Mancini's tinkering has left City light in midfield so the defenders are just hitting it long. Dzeko is is doing his best to turn punts into passes but it's not very productive so far.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Aguero wins the ball just outside the Ajax bonx and slams a shot just over. \"Man City - the George Lazenby of Group D?\" chuckles Simon McMahon, who's in a rich vein of form.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Dzeko meets Kolarvo's corner. Vermeer's saves Dzeko's header.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Ajax substitution:</strong> Boerrigter on, Schone off.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Dezko does well to take down another long ball, then feeds Tevez, who forces another corner. Ajax deal with it competently.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> City have four minutes to save their Champions League campaign and redeem themselves.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Kolarov bangs a 25-yard freekick straight into the wall. \"Even Steve McClaren can conquer Dutch teams,' tweets Will Unwin.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> The sky has fallen in on City. The most expensively-assembled team of all time are bottom of their Champions League group and tonight were punished for a passive, disjointed and at times feckless performance. They took the lead against the run of play and then seemed to the think they had already done enough. After conceding an equaliser on the stroke of half-time, they played the first 10 minutes of the second half with pace and purpose. And then relented again. And then conceded two sloppy goals. All in all, this was no why for a team with their resources to perform against valiant but eminently beatable opponents. City may need to win all three of their remaining games to save themselves: play like they have done in their first three (or at least two of their first three) and they probably won't win any.</p>",
  "<p>Gore Vidal, the recently demised American writer, once famously quipped that the US economic system is \"free enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich\".</p> <p>Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, not only has the US lived up to Vidal's caricature but the whole of the rich capitalist world has become more \"American\". The poor are increasingly exposed to market forces, with tougher conditions on the diminishing state protection they get, while the rich have unprecedented levels of protection from the state, with virtually no strings attached.</p> <p>The poor are told that their states are bankrupt because their previous governments splashed out on welfare payments for them.</p> <p>They \u2013 especially if they happen to be from the \"lazy\" eurozone periphery countries \u2013 are lectured that they have to pay for the \"good times\" they had with \"other people's money\" by working harder at lower wages and by accepting lower levels of welfare provision, with more stringent conditions.</p> <p>Of course, this narrative is completely misleading. The current budget deficits are mainly the outcomes of the fall in tax revenues caused by the financial crisis, rather than excessive social spending.</p> <p>In fact, in the runup to the crisis, countries like Spain and Ireland had run budget surpluses (for a decade, in the case of Ireland), while the deficit levels in other countries, except in Greece, were at manageable levels.</p> <p>The \"laziness\" argument also does not wash, as most poor people work much harder than the rich in any given country, while the Greeks, the Spaniards and the Portuguese work much longer (by at least a few hundred hours per year) than the Germans or the Dutch. In contrast, the rich are enjoying unprecedented levels of protection from market forces.</p> <p>Many financial and industrial companies have been bailed out with the public's money, but very few of those who had run those companies have been punished for their failures.</p> <p>Yes, the top managers of those companies have lost their jobs \u2013 but with a fat pension and mostly with a handsome severance payment. None of them have been punished for gross negligence or incompetence, even when they had flatly denied there was anything wrong with their business.</p> <p>The most prominent case in point is Joe Cassano \u2013 the chief financial officer of AIG, the American insurance company, who has been described as \"<a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-wall-street-is-using-the-bailout-to-stage-a-revolution-20090402\" title=\"\">Patient Zero of the global economic meltdown</a>\" by the journalist Matt Taibbi, who famously referred to <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2011/12/matt-taibbi-coiner-vampire-squid-tired-its-ubiquity/46149/#\" title=\"\">Goldman Sachs as \"vampire squid\"</a>. Just six months before his company's bailout, Cassano had said: \"[i]t is hard for us, without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of the [credit default swap] transactions\".</p> <p>There were, to be sure, occasions when the governments punished companies for obvious wrongdoings. However, those punishments were too meek to have any corrective effect on their subsequent behaviour, in contrast to the harsh punishments meted out to benefit cheats (they used to call this \"class justice\" in the 19th century).</p> <p>For example, in 2010, the US government fined Goldman Sachs $550m for the misselling of financial derivatives, but that was equivalent only to a couple of weeks' profit for the company in that year.</p> <p>Not only were they not punished for their failures, the surviving financiers have been drawing large salaries and bonuses despite the fact that they are living off state protection: \u2013 guarantees for bailouts, in the case of deposit banks and other financial institutions allied with them; and monetary policy of historical laxity, which has allowed them to operate with a fat profit margin even within a generally depressed economy. And some of them have done this even when their companies were doing very poorly, defying the basic market principle of linking compensation to performance.</p> <p>Moreover, even when they injected public money into failing companies, the governments made sure that they didn't apply market disciplines. When it bailed out General Motors, the US government deliberately took shares that do not have voting rights (albeit priority in dividend payouts) \u2013 so that it would not have any say in the management of the company.</p> <p>The British government has taken over (with shares with voting rights) two of the world's biggest banks \u2013 the RBS and HBOS \u2013 but refuses to order them to do its bidding, as any decent capitalist would have done to a company that he/she had taken over.</p> <p>While being helped by government protection to make money, the rich have also been given special allowances to keep as much of it as possible.</p> <p>And while they spend significant resources tracking down and punishing welfare cheats, the governments of the rich countries do nothing to close down tax havens, which have allowed many large companies and super-rich individuals to get away with paying less than their fair shares of tax.</p> <p>The spread of Vidal's \"American\" system, fortunately, may be meeting resistance. The recent news about the French government's injection of public money into the struggling car maker Peugeot-Citroen in return for tough conditions on the company's dividend payouts and re-investment, is a case in&#xa0;point.</p> <p>The very fact that the French government proposal is considered unusual eloquently speaks to the absurdity of the current situation in which the rich get more and more government protection with fewer conditions, while the poor get less and less protection with increasingly demanding conditions. It is time to redress the imbalance.</p>",
  "<p>Amazon is to be stripped of its huge tax advantage on the sales of electronic books after the European commission ordered Luxembourg to close a VAT loophole.</p> <p>Amazon is registered as a Luxembourg company and pays that country's VAT charge of 3% when it sells an ebook to a British reader, rather than the 20% it would have to charge if it were UK-based.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed this week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/21/amazon-forces-publishers-pay-vat-ebook\" title=\"\">Amazon is forcing British publishers to cover the cost of a 20% VAT charge on ebook sales</a> even though the true VAT cost to the online retailer is a fraction of that.</p> <p>The European commission \u2013 which oversees European Union law as the EU's executive arm \u2013 on Wednesday gave Luxembourg 30 days to increase its VAT rate on digital services from 3% to 15%. This will close a tax loophole that has encouraged companies such as Amazon, Skype and Netflix to be based in Luxembourg to benefit from the 3% rate when selling throughout the EU. Luxembourg must agree to change its VAT rate before the end of November, or face being referred to the European court of justice and risk fines. France has also been issued with a similar warning over its 7% rate for digital services.</p> <p>Amazon is expected to contest the commission ruling, so there will be no immediate impact on the cost of ebooks bought from its UK website.</p> <p>Luxembourg, with the lowest standard VAT rate in Europe, has been successful at attracting many global e-services providers. Under EU rules these companies are able to charge consumers across the EU the reduced Luxembourg VAT rate for these services. The home state of the consumer who makes the purchase receives no tax revenues.</p> <p>Charging ebooks at the 3% rate gives firms such as Amazon a huge competitive advantage over UK ebook retailers, which have to charge the local rate.</p> <p>The commission issued infringement proceedings in July against Luxembourg and France on the grounds that their policy was incompatible with EU law. The next step, a reasoned opinion, was published on Wednesday. Luxembourg and France will rely on the defence that there is an anomaly in EU VAT law which allows paper books and newspapers, for instance, to be charged at a reduced VAT rate; but digital must be charged at the standard, higher rate of the country in which the company is based.</p> <p>The commission, which is being pressured by national online booksellers which lose out to Amazon's better margins on digital sales will demand that member states cannot act alone and must seek unanimity amongst all 27 states. Richard Asquith, Global Head of VAT, TMF Group, the indirect tax consultancy, said: \"Countries across the EU have been breaking ranks by charging cut-rate VAT on services sold across borders. Luxembourg's move at the start of 2012 to cut its ebook rate to only 3% to help attract and retain the media industry has been copied by France, and I expect Belgium to do the same. The UK has held out at the full 20% VAT rate, which has a detrimental impact on the UK industry. The EC's move will seek to end these anomalies and tax competition amongst member states, and comes under pressure from member states' ministers of finance.\"</p> <p>The EU's move against Luxembourg will please the British publishing industry. British authors and publishers are fearful that Amazon's market dominance will send the industry into decline with consumers facing a smaller and less varied choice of books from fewer authors on sale in fewer retail outlets.</p> <p>Amazon is able to wield such power over publishers because it has a near monopoly of the UK digital book market. According to industry estimates, it sells 90% of all ebooks in Britain, while using its Luxembourg tax status to squeeze profitable terms from publishers.</p> <p>According to a contract seen by the Guardian, Amazon starts negotiations with its publishers on the basis that the UK VAT rate of 20% must be knocked off the cost price. However, its base in Luxembourg allows it to benefit from the European tax anomaly and pay VAT at 3%. This means that Amazon can charge the difference between the UK VAT levy imposed on publishers and the 3% it actually pays, creating a supplementary profit of \u00a31.38 a \u00a310 ebook in Britain. It then negotiates further substantial discounts on top of the VAT subsidy, which can result in Amazon seeking a discount of up to 65% on ebooks including the phantom VAT charge.</p>",

  "<p>Compared to the immense dignity of the Spanish nation following the Lorca earthquake in May 2011 in a region known for its past seismicity, when they realised better building codes were needed, the Italians have conducted a judicial witch-hunt following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in a far more seismically active area (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/jailing-italian-seismologists-scientific-community\" title=\"\">Italian court sends shockwaves around the world as it convicts seismologists</a>, 24 October). What would have happened if, due to the seismic swarm of small tremors, a full evacuation had been ordered and there had been widespread looting, but as often happens there had not been a major earthquake? Would the courts have jailed or bankrupted the experts for this costly disruption?</p> <p>The best scientific advice tries to estimate the likely size of the biggest quake a region is going to experience, and then looks at ground conditions, which can be a very significant factor. Soft alluvium wobbles like a jelly and major earthquakes can trigger landslips, and yet 60% of this tectonically active country has yet to be geological surveyed to modern standards. Rather than looking for scapegoats, the new Italian government needs to address this problem. Closer to home, supposedly unforeseen ground conditions and poor planning waste far more than the British Geological Survey failing to maintain an ongoing geological mapping programme, as large areas of our own country still require a complete overhaul and publication of 1:50,000 geological maps.<br><strong>David Nowell</strong><br><em>Fellow of the Geological Society</em></p> <p>\u2022 Italy's environment minister is quite right to highlight the ludicrous notion that doubt is no longer permitted in scientific evaluation.

  "<p>The news that the UK is doubling its drone deployment in Afghanistan (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/uk-double-drones-afghanistan\" title=\"\">New drones in Afghanistan to be controlled from Britain</a>, 23 October) raises some important questions that the British public needs to have answered. What rules of engagement currently govern the deployment of weaponised UK drones and who determines them? What influence will the US maintain over UK drone missions? Will UK deployment be confined to Afghan territory, or might cross-border strike missions be undertaken? If the MoD \"has no idea how many insurgents have died [in UK drone strikes] because of the 'immense difficulty and risks' of verifying who has been hit\", how can they state categorically that \"only four Afghan civilians have been killed\" since 2008?</p> <p>The announcement that the current five UK Reapers have already flown 39,628 hours and fired 334 Hellfire missiles in Afghanistan makes the escalation to 10 even more shocking. Parliament must assert a central role in publicly monitoring current and future deployment of UK drones to ensure there is no mission creep \u2013 President Obama's cavalier programme of distance slaughter cannot be replicated in UK conduct. If we kill as many innocent civilians as the CIA reportedly has, we shall surely reap what we sow.<br><strong>Robin Gill</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 This move reflects an incredibly disturbing trend in UK military policy. There has been no public debate or consultation about drone warfare, but the use of these unmanned killing machines has grown rapidly. While they purportedly allow for targeted, surgically precise strikes, recent reports have condemned the widespread killing of civilians \u2013 including hundreds of children \u2013 by drones. For the British public, it should also be disconcerting that RAF Waddington will be the new home for such remotely piloted violence. The distance afforded by unmanned aerial vehicles separates the military personnel guiding them from the arena of conflict in ways which we are only beginning to understand. Through such distorted interactions, a cheapening of the human impact of these vehicles \u2013 and the resultant civilian casualties \u2013 is inevitable. This decision represents a complete disregard for international law and innocent lives.<br><strong>Kate Hudson</strong><br><em>General secretary, CND</em></p> <p>\u2022 With regard to the moral aspect of the use of such weapons, I am reminded of the response of Bill Westwood, the late bishop of Peterborough, to the use of the atomic bomb on Japan in 1945. As a young paratrooper stationed in Sri Lanka awaiting deployment in the proposed invasion of Japan, he noted that the loss of life was going to be horrendous, given the Japanese renown for not surrendering. When asked later what he thought at the time, he said that while he didn't know what the atomic bomb was, he was relieved that he would not now be invading Japan. While the use of these drones is subject to debate, perhaps what little can be taken by the use of this weapon is that fewer UK troops engaged in fighting in Afghanistan will die while we remain in theatre.<br><strong>Robert Thomas</strong><br><em>Botcheston, Leicestershire </em></p> <p>\u2022 It is vital the suggestion that British support for US drone strikes \"may be a war crime\" is raised urgently (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/uk-support-us-drones-pakistan-war-crime\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 24 October). The increasing use of drones, not only by the US, but Israel, France and now the UK, raises questions of legitimacy not covered adequately by the present Geneva convention. Two weeks ago, Medact (a charity concerned about the impact of war on people's health) launched a report, <a href=\"http://www.medact.org/article_health.php?articleID=990\" title=\"\">Drones \u2013 The Physical and Psychological Implications of a Global Theatre of War</a>. It examines the devastating impact of drone warfare on the health of those in areas where they are deployed. Drone warfare has the attraction for the belligerent nation of providing the means to conduct war at arm's length and thus avoid endangering its own soldiers. Many other countries are also now researching drone warfare, and a rapid proliferation of their use will have far wider implications than even nuclear proliferation itself.</p> <p>It is vital our government develops policies to cover this new type of warfare in accordance with Geneva convention guidelines before it becomes another scourge of humanity, profiting only the powerful armaments manufacturers.<br><strong>John Green</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 We need to add the US base at NSA Menwith Hill to the list of concerns. There are GCHQ personnel at NSA Menwith Hill and this base plays a crucial role in \"intelligence-led warfare\". You don't have to be too smart to make the connections. Recently, Fabian Hamilton MP asked the defence secretary whether RAF Menwith Hill played a role in the planning and deployment of drones in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. The answer? \"For operational and security reasons we do not comment on the specific activities carried out at RAF Menwith Hill.\" It is wrong that the UK government hides behind this \"operational and security\" blanket. The bottom line is whether what the UK government is complicit with at either NSA Menwith Hill or RAF Waddington is legal and accountable. <br><strong>Lindis Percy</strong><br><em>Joint co-ordinator, Campaign for the Accountability of American Bases</em></p> <p>\u2022 According to your report, between 2,562 and 3,325 people have been killed in Pakistan from coalition drone attacks between June 2004 and mid-September 2012 \u2013 of whom between 474 and 881 were civilians, including 176 children. The UK is spending \u00a34bn of taxpayers' money on developing more of these drones, which I cannot recall being debated by and agreed on by parliament. These weapons are breaking international and humanitarian laws and fostering a video game mentality in warfare. Future wars will be fought not by people in the frontline but by remote-controlled killing machines. This type of warfare increases the sanitisation of conflict in which aggressors avoid taking moral responsibility for their actions.<br><strong>David Penney</strong><br><em>Colne, Lancashire</em></p>",
  "<p>We've reached a moment in American history where debates can be judged by who buys the most clever keyword on Twitter and how quickly (and how many) Tumblrs are launched while they are still happening. As the series of debates this month ended, I felt a pang of guilt and jealousy for every journo-tweet that scrolled across my screen with the simple message: \"Read my take here.\" We're doing \"takes\" now \u2013 though I think of them not as quick sketches of opinion, but in the movie-production sense: a series of line-readings varied in intonation but not content.</p> <p>It would be heresy to say anything besides what's already been decided (by whom? I can't always tell), and the tide of identical opinion overwhelms subtle distinctions about individual arguments. So, when it comes to the presidential contests: Obama lost the first debate; Romney lost the second debate; foreign policy lost the third. </p> <p>The insistence on declaring a \"winner\" in presidential debates has always irritated me. In arguments over philosophy, ideology or morality, what counts as \"winning\"? Back in high school forensics, we walked into speech-and-debate tournaments ready to argue either side, fully aware that the judges evaluated logical consistency, command of the material, originality of arguments, and presentation \u2013 not who was <em>right</em>. To \"win on points\" was a meaningful phrase, because someone was keeping score.</p> <p>Today's presidential debates don't even have a consistent standard for accuracy, and \"winning on points\" just means you came out ahead in a very high-level battle of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens\">the dozens</a>. Very well, never mind: it's exactly like high school except then we trusted the judges, because \"zingers\" and moments of special fluency, and not truth, are what seems to sway voters. Voters are not, for instance, undecided on the question of whether across-the-board tax cuts are a good idea. (In fact, they seem set against them <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/poll-don-t-extend-bush-cuts-for-wealthy-20120618?mrefid=mostViewed\">when you ask directly</a>.)</p> <p>Voters take in a discussion of tax rates as a form of instructional moral theater, a passion play in which the roles of good and evil haven't been definitively cast but will be determined by who makes the argument that <em>sounds</em> the most righteous. How else do you explain the consistent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253665216922005506\">approval</a> of Romney's tax spiel among undecided voters? The Twitter feed of the professors who supervised CNN's \"dial test\" shows, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253662826395209728\">again</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErinBurnett/status/258378909014425600\">again</a>, undecided voters reacting positively to policies that are demonstrably unpopular with most Americans, including independents, by <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57416095/cbs-news-nyt-poll-4-18-12/%20?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">margins of 20-30%</a>. (Only 36% all voters say the best way to promote economic growth is \"lower taxes and cut spending\"; 34% of independents say the same.)</p> <p>Judging the debates on salesmanship makes it easier to see past complaints from Democrats that the Romney who showed up for the debates was a different one than we saw on the stump: you can't really say Romney misrepresented <em>himself</em>, just his policies. Indeed, we saw both candidates' true nature, if not always the truth, throughout the series. </p> <p>They are both thin-skinned nerds, whose confidence about their command of facts is more certain than the facts themselves. Obama's sleepy nonchalance in the first debate and narrow-eyed near-sadism in the second spoke, in their way, to his arrogance; whereas Romney's casual, inappropriate references to all things he wants to subdue as things he \"likes\" (Big Bird, teachers, green energy) did the same.</p> <p>Romney showed himself to be awkwardly distant from the norms of American life (what struggling family doesn't look forward to tax-free capital gains!?) and speech (binders!). Obama demonstrated a Gen-X sense of humor, bordering on contemptuous (\"the 80s called\"). Romney's persnickety fixation with the debates' guidelines underscored a preoccupation with compliance that I felt belied the Obama camp's worst insinuations about him: whatever his tax returns or time at Bain might reveal, the guy is not a rule-breaker, much less a felon.</p> <p>Romney is as obsessed with following the letter of the law as Obama is with fudging literal fulfillment of regulations he believes objectionable \u2013 or, at least, politically inconvenient. However well-intentioned he might be, this is an apt description of the administration's position on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/politics/immigration-administration-reaction/index.html\">immigration law</a> and the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obamas-legal-progression-on-defense-of-marriage-act/\">Defense of Marriage Act</a>: intentional avoidance of enforcement. This casual attitude toward regulations one doesn't care for makes Obama more like George Bush than many Democrats would like to admit (see also: drone strikes, kill lists).</p> <p>Such self-assured capriciousness when it comes to governance is not a moral position I'm particularly comfortable with \u2013 and I'm not sure it's superior to Romney's programmatic intellectual alchemy (\"You say I'm inconsistent? Here is why I'm not! See? I fixed it!\"). Even more to the point, Romney abides by the rules \u2013 but wants to rewrite them so that they benefit him and people like him. And he sees nothing wrong with that.</p> <p>Yet, for a long time, I've thought that Romney's ingrained devotion to rules would make him a relatively unobjectionable president. As my dad put it once:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At least he won't get us into illegal wars.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But, of course, the debates showed that Romney's most unwavering trait is changeability. He might not get us into any \"illegal wars\" \u2013 but only because <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/08/02/627031/dan-senor-romney-closest-adviser/?mobile=nc\">Dan Senor</a> will convince him that there's a law they're following somewhere. Romney is somehow more adaptive to his environment than even our first biracial president.</p> <p>And in that way, he's following a path to victory much like the one we followed as high school rhetoricians: say anything.</p>",

Instead, the author was commissioned to write it by a charity \u2013 the Liverpool-based Reader Organisation \u2013 and <a href=\"http://thereader.org.uk/events-and-publications/our-read/\" title=\"\">50,000 copies were given away for free this year</a>. It beat books by authors including Roddy Doyle, the late Russell Hoban and Eva Ibbotson, to win the \u00a31,500 award.</p> <p>It is not the author and screenwriter's first major children's literature prize. In 2004 he won the Carnegie medal for his novel Millions, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366777/\" title=\"\">which was made into a film directed by Boyle and released the same year</a>.</p> <p>The Guardian's children's books editor, Julia Eccleshare, who was joined on the judging panel by authors Cressida Cowell, Tony Bradman and Kevin Crossley-Holland, said The Unforgotten Coat contained \"a very profound message dressed up in a magical, original, humorous story\".</p> <p>The story follows two brothers from Mongolia who go to school in Bootle, Merseyside, but are forced to return to their homeland. It is told from the perspective of their new friend Julie, also in year six.</p> <p>\"It absolutely captures the feel of being a child of that age,\" said Eccleshare. \"It's not a big blockbusting novel with obvious themes of dystopia and apocalypse \u2013 instead it's a heart-warming, imaginative, funny story with a very serious message at its heart.\"</p> <p>The Unforgotten Coat was inspired by the true story of a Mongolian girl called Misheel who Cottrell Boyce met while doing a reading at a primary school.</p> <p>When she was taken in the night by the immigration authorities to be deported, one of the things her classmates were most worried about was that Misheel had left her coat behind, as they knew how cold it was in Mongolia. It was an image, Cottrell Boyce said, that haunted him.</p> <p>\"It wasn't a commercial book at all \u2013 it came from a very different place,\" he said. \"The Reader Organisation promotes reading to all kinds of different groups, from kids with difficulties to alcoholics, and they were looking for a book which would cross all the groups. They found it very difficult to find, so I wrote this as a gift.\"</p> <p>Featuring original pictures by Liverpool photographers Carl Hunter and Clare Heney, The Unforgotten Coat \"wasn't written to win prizes or sell loads of copies\", said Cottrell Boyce.</p> <p>\"I love the Guardian prize, the fact it's given by other writers, and that it's gone to books I loved reading like The Owl Service. It's fantastic to win it anyway, but to win with something so exuberant, that was not trying to win any awards, is really great. This is a book that was written for fun, and for friendship.\"</p> <p>Sue Kendall \u2013 the woman who invited Cottrell Boyce to speak at the school where he met Misheel \u2013 was at the ceremony. The author writes in an afterword to the novel that as he was putting the finishing touches to the book, he bumped into Kendall, \"and she told me that Misheel had \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 rung her that morning from Mongolia\".</p>",

The Forestry Commission has stopped planting ash in its woodlands as a precaution.</p> <p>Morgan said the trees found with the disease could have been infected some time ago, and that further tests were needed.</p> <p>He said: \"Scientists from our own Forest Research agency are also carrying out diagnostic tests on a number of other samples from established woodland trees in East Anglia with symptoms indicative of this disease, and we expect the results within a few days.</p> <p>\"It is still early days and investigations are continuing, but there is a possibility that the East Anglia outbreak is an isolated one which has been present for some time.

  "<p>Ford has called a meeting of trade union officials in the UK this morning amid speculation that its Southampton plant is at risk of closure with the loss of 500 jobs.</p> <p>The continuing crisis in the eurozone has forced the US car maker to restructure its European operations and yesterday it announced the shutting of a Belgian factory with 4,300 redundancies.</p> <p>Ford declined to comment on reports that it is preparing to close its Southampton site, which employs 500 people and makes Transit vans - the only vehicle that Ford makes in the UK. However, it has taken the unusual step of calling its British trade union representatives to a meeting at its Basildon technical centre at 10am on Thursday.</p> <p>The staff representatives will be addressed by Stephen Odell, head of Ford's European operations, who said on Wednesday that Ford had to address a capacity glut caused by a 20% fall in demand in western Europe since 2007. Announcing the closure of the Genk site in Belgium, he said: \"The proposed restructuring of our European manufacturing operations is a fundamental part of our plan to strengthen Ford's business in Europe and to return to profitable growth.\"</p> <p>Tony Burke, assistant general secretary at Unite, which represents 7,500 Ford staff, said management had given no indication about the reason for the meeting. \"This is a very worrying time for the UK workforce. Unite is currently working hard alongside its European colleagues to get clarity about Ford's plans,\" he said.</p> <p>However, an industry source said that the last time Ford called a meeting of all UK shop stewards was in 2007, when it announced the closure of its Leamington foundry site with the loss of 450 jobs.</p> <p>Ford refused to confirm whether there will be a statement about the company's UK operations. Ford's Dagenham plant in Essex, which makes diesel engines and panels, is its biggest UK outlet with 4,000 employees, followed by its nearby technical centre in Basildon which has 3,000 employees and Bridgend in Wales, where 2,000 people make petrol engines.</p> <p>However, the company did confirm that a restructuring of its European operations is under way, as the continent's carmakers grapple with excess factory capacity and falling sales. Ford's Genk plant will close in 2014 with the loss of 4,300 jobs, the company said. Production of the Mondeo, S-Max and Galaxy vehicles will move to Valencia in Spain. Ford said it had to address a capacity glut caused by a 20% fall in demand in western Europe since 2007. Sales in Ford's main European markets have fallen 12% in the year to date, to 861,000 vehicles.</p> <p>The Southampton plant, in Swaythling, made 28,000 engines last year. Unite warned in September that 1,000 jobs could be lost if manufacturing of the next-generation Transit van engine moves from Dagenham to Romania.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande risked a backlash from European carmakers and governments by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/24/francois-hollande-backlash-peugeot-citroen-rescue\" title=\"\">rescuing France's Peugeot Citro\u00ebn with a \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.66bn) state-financing package</a> on Wednesday.</p> <p>The German state of Lower Saxony, the second largest investor in Volkswagen, has already expressed opposition to the financing plan and Peugeot must also seek European Union approval for the deal. The European competition commissioner, Joaquin Almunia, said Brussels would have to conduct a \"very careful assessment\" of the deal. The French government is offering \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for Peugeot's financing arm, Banque PSA Finance, which underpins Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn dealer networks and car loans.</p> <p>Peugeot has no French state shareholding and is 25%-owned by the Peugeot family. But it will have to submit to political oversight as a condition of the deal, a caveat made explicit by the French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, who said the government has \"no intention of handing out gifts like this without return commitments.\" Peugeot will not pay dividends, launch share buybacks or grant share options to senior executives while the state guarantee is in place. The company will also revisit plans to close its Aulnay plant near Paris and axe 6,500 jobs, according to reports.</p> <p>It is France's biggest intervention in its car industry since 2009, when it gave Peugeot and Renault \u20ac6bn in low-interest loans. Peugeot said this morning that third-quarter sales fell 4% to \u20ac12.9bn in the three months to September. \"The competitive environment is getting tougher, with increased pricing pressure and ongoing deterioration in the markets of southern Europe,\" the company said.</p> <p>Volvo, the Gothenburg-based truck maker, said on Wednesday it expected no growth in the European and US markets next year after third-quarter orders fell by a quarter compared with the same period last year.</p>",
  "<p>You won't see another picture of a leering Jimmy Savile here. I don't want to see any more of him. Really, can the media stop with the Savile imagery now that we know what he did?</p> <p>However, it seems some people are still fundamentally missing the point. This is a story about an environment of abuse, how it flourished in plain sight, how supposedly \"good guys\" did nothing to stop it, and how girls are never really to be trusted. Or never actually a priority.</p> <p>Some weird cultural transference has taken place to turn all this into a crisis of trust in the BBC. In some ways, that's much easier to \"debate\" because it fits several agendas. There will always be those wanting to bash the BBC in a post-Leveson world, in a multi-channel \"why should I not get everything for free?\" world. The critics have been aided by the muffled, ill-informed and frankly useless appearances of those at the top of the organisation. These guys appear to lack ability, humility or even basic empathy. When the bosses of the other institutions, prisons and hospitals involved have to explain how Savile was given a free run to sick and vulnerable people, we may hope they are better prepared.</p> <p>Part of that preparation might be simply to understand what sexual abuse actually <em>is</em>. Comments, such as those attributed to Newsnight editor Peter Rippon about \"just the women\" not being sufficiently credible sources, or about the crimes being not \"the worst kind\" as the girls were not \"too young\", or these not being the worst sort of offences, show not only total ignorance but innate arrogance.</p> <p>There are plenty of organisations that work with those who have been abused, men and women. Some people are deeply damaged. The ones you step over like bags of rubbish as they sleep in doorways, the crack \"whores\" with swivelling chameleon eyes, the women in prisons who night after night try to strangle themselves with homemade ligatures. We could ask such people about how sexual abuse affects one's life.</p> <p>We could ask that much-vilified profession, social workers, about abuse. Indeed, the BBC earlier this year made a brilliant series in Bristol \u2013 Protecting Our Children \u2013 about the dilemmas social workers face in complicated cases where cycles of abuse continue. I know people right now are having to make a decision to remove a child from a family after a series of disclosures about the white stuff that came out of \"Daddy's willy\" when they were having their special time. The last thing this child wants is for her Daddy to be taken away.</p> <p>One current myth is that we now overprotect children, and that in Savile's day it was different. Not so. I worked in residential care homes in the late 1970s and we knew damn well what abuse was. Suspicions would arise about fellow workers and they would be reported and acted upon. Of course, we saw a lot of highly \"sexualised\" behaviour by kids in care, which was difficult to read. The worst was in a lock-up unit where the scale of self-harming \u2013 we didn't use that term then \u2013 was impossible to bear. It was not unusual to hear a girl say her father taught her \"the facts of life\" at 10 by taking her outside and raping her.</p> <p>I am not sorry if this upsets you. It should. We learned that there are different ways of working with victims. For some, abuse at a very young age provides emotional insulation, for others it means a permanent splitting in how they relate to the world. When force had been used, strangely, some girls were able to heal themselves more easily than when it hadn't. This clearly applies to Savile's victims. They felt stupid, disposable and as if they had only themselves to blame.</p> <p>Their silence was amplified by a culture that saw girls as untrustworthy and worthless. This has not gone. Both the right and far left embody virulent anti-women positions. The right focuses on the lone paedophile stranger as it cannot accept that abuse occurs in its sacred heart, the nuclear family. The far left sees abuse as a product of the dreaded middle-class liberal imagination.</p> <p>The failure of agencies to intervene is not new. The cultural whisperings are not new. Check out <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/phreakdown/jimmy-saville-1988\" title=\"\">Jerry Sadowitz's comedy routine about Savile's predilections in the late 1980s</a> or Irvine Welsh's character Freddy Royle in Ecstasy. Remember the silence of those who knew what was going on in the Fred West household. Child rape done in the name of do-gooding is not new. We can look at the blighted history of the missionary position, never mind the Catholic church.</p> <p>So whether a few highly paid TV executives get pensioned off is not my concern. That this predicament should shove aside the voices of the victims disgusts me. Now is the time to listen to those who work with children, to what they tell us about routine gang rape, about pain and anger directly, inwardly, and outwardly. I resent being told about the priorities of this story. For me it is about listening to the realities of young women's lives now, as well as those of Savile's victims. The abuse of power inherent in the phrase \"just the women\" rings as clear as a bell. You can choose to hear it, or not.</p>",

  "<p>There was a moment, in the second presidential debate, when President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney circled each other warily, looking like they were about to come to blows. So when they agree on something, it perks up the ears.</p> <p>It turns out that, in the final debate on Monday, they agreed on two things.</p> <p>The first point is that Americans, largely don't care about \u2013 or at least won't vote based on \u2013 foreign policy. That's why both candidates, after some bickering about Syria, Egypt and Libya, hijacked Monday's final presidential debate into the political version of a Thelma and Louise rebellion, careening into domestic policy, education, and other issues more likely to sway the American heart.</p> <p>But before they did, there emerged another, subtler point of agreement: the highlight of American foreign policy right now has been our successful sanctions against Iran, which may be working on developing a nuclear weapon. As each candidate struggled to outdo the other in protestations of the purity of their love for Israel, they knew that the way to Israel's heart was to shut down Iran. Both Obama and Romney were happy to point to evidence that America has done just that.</p> <p>Obama noted, during the debate, that the Iranian rial has dropped in value by 80% and the country's oil production is lower than it has been for two decades. \"So their economy is in a shambles,\" Obama said. Romney agreed that Iranian sanctions have been successful, adding only that he would go even further \u2013 perhaps even to the brink of military action.</p> <p>But have we been smart and powerful enough to bring Iran around to our way of thinking after decades of trying? Has the threat of American financial power been the decisive factor that may have wiped the confident smirk off the face of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad?</p> <p>It's easy to see why it's appealing to think so.&#xa0;In an otherwise bleak year for both foreign policy and the economy, when the US seems to be floating somewhere undefined between a grim recent financial past and a tiresome future of endless sniping about tax policy, the fact that we can exert financial pressure on Iran seems a chance for a well-deserved pat on the back.</p> <p>This summer, the US financial authorities fined major international banks \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-bank-charges-merit-real-penalties-if-proved\">HSBC, Standard Chartered</a> \u2013 for money-laundering, which included, in part, helping Iran evade US financial sanctions. Between the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/07/white-house-insists-iran-sanctions-are-working-130653.html\">presidential chest-beating</a> and the big fines, the message seemed clear: one thing, at least, is going right. America still has its old mojo. The war in Iraq didn't turn out quite right, our influence in Afghanistan may be questionable, and we may remain baffled about what to do about Benghazi and even Egypt, but when it comes to Iran, America has come out like a champ.</p> <p>But, not so fast. As another iteration of President Obama might have said, \"If you have successful Iranian sanctions, you didn't build that.\"</p> <p>We owe, instead, a lot more credit to our beleaguered compatriots who run the European financial system. Iran gave up on the US years ago; America has had sanctions on Iran, in some form or another, since 1979. Getting around that was easy for Iran. Every time US authorities banned one suspicious Iranian entity, another would pop up, as quick as zucchini, and would go on doing business \u2013 most likely, in Europe.</p> <p>Jim Rickards is the author of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2012/03/12/book-review-james-rickards-currency-wars/\">the book Currency Wars</a> and a partner with the hedge fund JAC Capital, as well as an adviser to intelligence agencies on financial and economic issues. Of America's attempts to root out Iranian dictators and particularly Ahmedinejad, he says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We've tried everything: cyberwarfare, financial warfare, psychological operations, assassinations and sabotage. It's not like we haven't been trying. But because the [Ahmedinejad] regime is so brutal, so entrenched, so powerful and so rich, it has not produced the thing everyone wants, which is Iran giving up on its nuclear ambitions. It's very clear diplomacy has failed and Iranians use the promise of negotiations just to buy time.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, why is Iran weakening now \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/world/iran-said-ready-to-talk-to-us-about-nuclear-program.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">as the New York Times reports, seeking talks</a>?</p> <p>Because, since March, the European financial system, which had been adamantly neutral, has turned against Iran. Europe&#xa0;is the base of the core of the global financial system: <a href=\"http://www.swift.com/banks\">Swift, a kind of international instant-message service of banking</a>. Every major financial transaction in Europe has to be chronicled in Swift. When Citigroup has to send, say, $1bn to Deutsche Bank, it doesn't just shovel the money over. Citi sends a message through Swift first.</p> <p>In March, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/world/middleeast/crucial-communication-network-expelling-iranian-banks.html?_r=0\">Swift kicked out 30 Iranian banks</a>, preventing them from doing business in euros. The US also prevented Iran from doing business in dollars. Then, in mid-October, <a href=\"http://hsf-fsrandcorpcrimenotes.com/2012/10/17/eu-strengthens-sanctions-against-iran-with-particular-impact-for-oil-and-gas-sector-and-financial-institutions/\">Europe proposed to penalize any banks doing business on behalf of Iran</a> and proposed penalties on natural-gas exports.</p> <p>After that, it wasn't long before that New York Times report surfaced that Iran was ready to start diplomatic talks with the US. The Obama administration <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/report-on-iran-talks-reverberates-on-sunday-shows/?ref=politics\">denies the report, though the New York Times stands by it</a>.</p> <p>\"Getting [Europe's] commitment to tighten the noose on Iran is really important to help persuade that country,\" said Tony Fratto, of Hamilton Place Strategies, who was an adviser in the Bush administration. \"We haven't had indirect or loose ties with Iran since 1979. Europe has. A lot of Iranians with wealth store their wealth in Europe.\"</p> <p>Unable to do business in either dollars or euros, Iran is in a dangerous political position. A few months ago, Iran started creating multiple exchange rates in its economy, allowing people to get rare dollars more cheaply only if they are importing absolutely essential goods into Iran. So, $1 in America is now worth 12,279 rials \u2013 and that's only if the rials are used to buy essentials like medicine and grain for food. Those who want to buy livestock or minerals pay something closer to 25,500 rials for a single US dollar. The actual exchange rate, which now functions largely in the black market, is closer to 35,000 rials for each American dollar.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1276152--international-sanctions-mean-skyrocketing-prices-for-iranians\">hits both the rich and the poor</a>. Iran is still a country of sophisticated consumers, who like their iPods and their HP printers as much as we do. But those goods are smuggled into the country, and the smugglers accept usually dollars. Simple supermarket trips are becoming a complicated calculus. And as for Iranians in hospitals, or those served by charities, they are suffering for lack of supplies.</p> <p>Overall, the Iranian economy is struggling with sky-high inflation \u2013 as high as nearly 70%, <a href=\"http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article37144.html\">estimates Johns Hopkins economist Steven Hanke</a>. This is exactly what America wants: a regime struggling with a bad economy has much more trouble holding on to power.&#xa0;Hyperinflation is a reliable harbinger of a government that's about to topple. Look at Germany during the Weimar Republic, or China just before the Tiananmen Square riots. Hyperinflation often predates revolutions.</p> <p>Iran threatened Tuesday to stop producing oil, a move that Fratto compared to cinematic farce. \"Iran doesn't even produce their own gasoline; they don't have refineries,\" he pointed out. \"They need to export oil or go bankrupt. I guess they could turn off the spigot for a short while, but it's really suicidal for them to do it. It's like Blazing Saddles when the guy holds the gun up to his own head and says 'Stop or I'll shoot.'\"</p> <p>Iran's bind is a good lesson not in American power, but in America's power when we share it with allies.</p> <p>During and after the financial crisis, what helped stabilize the US and European economies was the fact that the US Federal Reserve worked with the European Central Bank to pour money into the system. The old unilateral model of a single country ruling a financial empire \u2013 even a soft empire \u2013 seems to have passed. To influence the world economy and topple regimes, you need coalitions to move money. And only then can you move the world.</p>",
  "<p>It was 1999 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/uk-garage-pop-craig-david\" title=\"\">the UK garage scene</a> was in full swing. I was covering nightlife for the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sleaze-hits-the-high-street-1147171.html\" title=\"\">London clubbing magazine Sleazenation</a> and used to start off at one party and wait for people to tell me about others. I heard about this rave, in a disused warehouse just off the Old Kent Road, on pirate radio. Walking past, you wouldn't have known it was there but for the dull thud of the music. It was all pretty haphazard: a sound system had just been put in, and a makeshift outdoor bar.</p> <p>I was a mod before I&nbsp;became a photographer and have always wished I'd been able to capture that era. So I&nbsp;was&nbsp;keen to document UK&nbsp;garage, which was very much about showing off, looking sharp and appearing to be moneyed. I&nbsp;think those are the defining characteristics of British youth culture: the idea that, whatever your circumstances, you are perceived to be doing well and living for the weekend. It was&nbsp;great to photograph: people would&nbsp;hire expensive fancy cars just to&nbsp;pull up outside the club, or dress from head to toe in Moschino.</p> <p>In those days, I had a medium-format Japanese camera. It looked quite unusual. I'd try to make pictures around scenarios \u2013 singling out characters, waiting for things to unfold. This made me stand out and people would often say hello. It was like having a night out with a camera. There were 10 frames a film and I'd average 20 rolls&nbsp;a night.</p> <p>It was all very hedonistic: there was&nbsp;a heavy smell of weed. The guy&nbsp;offering a spliff to someone is&nbsp;up next to MC. None of them were any good at MCing. The lyrics were generic&nbsp;and you couldn't hear them&nbsp;properly anyway.</p> <p>I think the shot is a succinct depiction of youth culture over the last&nbsp;20 years. Here they are in their own environment, with their community, making the most of what they've got. We can all find something we recognise in images of adolescence. I hope that's the success of this picture. We've been there, one way or another, and know it's an exciting time.</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1971</p> <p><strong>Studied</strong> University of Brighton</p> <p><strong>Influences</strong> <a href=\"http://artsite.arts.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/hebdige.html\" title=\"\">Dick Hebdige</a>, <a href=\"http://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/men-women-2\" title=\"\">Tom Wood</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/petetownshend\" title=\"\">Pete Townshend</a></p> <p><strong>High point</strong> \"Self-publishing my own books was a real buzz.\"</p> <p><strong>Low point</strong> \"Living through an apolitical time.

  "<p>Vladimir Kim, chairman of the FTSE 100 mining company Kazakhmys and one of Britain's wealthiest residents, has been accused of giving false evidence to a foreign court during the trial of a former prime minister of Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Kim, who was ranked 32nd in the 2012 Sunday Times rich list with a fortune of \u00a32bn, has been sent a letter from lawyers acting for Akezhan Kazhegeldin, who was prime minister of Kazakhstan from 1994 \u2013 1997, challenging testimony the businessman supplied to a Kazakh court in 2001 when the former politician was convicted in his absence of abuse of office.</p> <p>Kazhegeldin, who lives in exile in London, is now attempting to win compensation in international courts and says that key evidence that convicted him \u2013 including the claims he received a Mercedes Benz and a Toyota for his personal use while still in office \u2013 was falsely provided by Kim.</p> <p>The letter, which has been seen by the Guardian and sent to Kim at his London office and Knightsbridge apartment, said: \"We understand that you knew that your evidence was not true. You gave evidence that you had delivered the cars to Mr Kazhegeldin, but we can prove that this did not happen, nor could it have done so.</p> <p>\"We can well imagine the pressure was brought upon you in order to have you give false evidence. It would assist our client ... if you were to make a statement explaining this pressure and providing full details of your involvement in the whole affair\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Kazakhmys, which will make its third-quarter trading statement on Thursday, said that Kim denied receiving the correspondence. He added: \"These matters have already been extensively dealt with in the press and we have no more to add beyond the evidence given by Mr Kim in court in 2001.\"</p> <p>However, the spokesman could not point to any previous press coverage on the topic and only referred to a <a href=\"http://www.globalwitness.org/library/risky-business-kazakhstan-kazakhmys-plc-and-london-stock-exchange\" title=\"\">report into Kazakhmys published two years ago by the campaign group Global Witness</a>, which detailed Kim's testimony about paying bribes to the former prime minister, as well as Kazhegeldin's denials.</p> <p>The document, though, focused on questioning why investors were not warned at Kazakhmys's flotation that the company's chairman claimed to have been forced to pay bribes in Kazakhstan. It did not mention Kazhegeldin's claims of possessing supporting evidence that could potentially contradict Kim's testimony.</p> <p>The request by Kazhegeldin's lawyers for a statement from Kim, who owns one of London's most luxurious apartments at One Hyde Park, relates to cases they have launched in Malta and Italy against Rakhat Aliyev, a former head of Kazakhstan's committee on national security.</p> <p>Kazhegeldin claims that Aliyez launched a campaign against him while he was prime minister which resulted in his conviction and has caused him financial loss.</p> <p>Aliyev, who was also once Kazakhstan's ambassador to Austria and formerly the son-in-law to President Nursultan Nazarbayev, has himself fled Kazakhstan and is now living in exile in Vienna and Malta. Like Kazhegeldin, he claims to be a victim of a political witch-hunt in his homeland. Aliyev's lawyer did not respond to phone calls and request for comment.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q:</strong> In the inaugural George Bradshaw Address last year, Rick Haythornthwaite said: \"We know that many of the public view the leadership of the industry with confusion, suspicion or disdain. They don't trust us and therefore are resistant to changes we want to make.\" Is there a lack of public support for the rail industry and if so, how serious an impediment is it to the industry's progress?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The points that Rick made last year are very important and what we have done on the Rail Delivery Group, and what I hope to bring out in my speech, is to carry forward the answers to the questions he posed. Given the current state of the industry it is critical that we come together to find the answers. There is an issue of public comprehension of the industry and I hope to develop that theme in my speech, pointing to a complexity in the industry that creates value in many ways but it also creates confusion in the minds of the public. They feel that it is difficult to understand the industry and to do business with it, to access it, to be sure they are getting the best deal. It is incumbent on the industry to overcome that. And that, partly, leads to the perception issue that Rick talked about.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> &#xa0;The west coast franchise process has been cancelled and the award of three more contracts has been postponed. What does this mean for the franchise system going forward and for its credibility?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> If there is a crisis in this industry then it is with regard to this subject. We have to work with the government to make sure that we preserve the benefits of what franchises have given us, while addressing the concerns that have been raised. However, those concerns are in many ways unclear to all of us since the deficiencies outlined by the government are to do with its own deliberations on the west coast main line contract. I</p> <p>don't know if anyone has clarity about what exactly happened. The need to react constructively, and find a new way forward, weighs heavily on FirstGroup in particular, since we were the wronged party who, as the government said, acted entirely in accordance withits instructions. We don't, however, want to exacerbate the problems caused by this decision taken by the department. At FirstGroup we have to find a constructive way forward while at the same time protecting our position.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>&#xa0;As chair of the Rail Delivery Group, in your view how far has the industry come in achieving the reforms outlined by <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/publications/realising-the-potential-of-gb-rail/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sir Roy McNulty's report into realising value in GB rail</a>?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>We have come a very long way in comprehending the reforms outlined byMcNulty. That is important because now we know what is in the realm of the possible, what can be developed and what cannot be counted on.</p> <p>The very large numbers that relate to train utilisation will not be achieved [McNulty said costs could be lowered if trains are used more] because we think there are some basic problems in the analysis. Achieving the numbers outlined by McNulty would require such an extensive change in service patterns that we don't believe there would be sufficient interest.</p> <p>In terms of changes to asset and supply chain management, we believe we can put structures in place that will allow the industry to grasp those savings. However, most of those savings occur in the CP5 period between 2014 and 2019 and achieving them requires the government to make choices. So they have to approve basic structures and incentivise train operating companies, freight operating companies and Network Rail to co-operate with each other.</p> <p>Train operators and freight operators have to see that long-term vision in place in order to feel that they are not giving away some competitive advantage in franchising, in order to get those sums. That's why we have to get franchising back up and running. We will not uncover all the savings that McNulty talked about if we don't recover the franchising programme promptly. We will not be able to get the alliance structures, and other structural changes, that will be critical to creating those savings.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much further does the industry have to go before it can achieve McNulty's vision, as well as \u00a31bn in cost cuts?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The \u00a31bn target is a serious ambition. This will come out in the government's High Level Output Statement, which sets out what it wants from the railway over the next five years. As the industry completes its response to that, which sets out how they are going to deliver the HLOS with the funds available, we run into this \u00a31bn number head-on. While at the RDG we are absolutely confident in the work that we have done and it opens up savings, we are working with the government to make sure that everybody has the sums in the right columns, to avoid double-counting and duplication. There is no way that Network Rail can hit its goals without the full cooperation of the rail operating companies and freight operating companies.</p> <p><strong>Q:&#xa0;</strong>Do you sympathise with passengers who complain that rail fares are too expensive, consistently rise higher than inflation, and are poor value for money?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I do sympathise with passengers. So long as we have fare increases above inflation, people are going to feel aggrieved. But the growth keeps coming. At FirstGroup we find that the growth is coming not from people paying high-profile fares that we see in the media, but from finding value on the network. The industry labours under the fact that the government's policy is to shift the cost from taxpayers to passengers. That transition makes us look like we are going for big rate increases. I don't think that is a fair depiction of what is happening. With the government's recent changes on fare increases [being lower than expected], I hope that perception starts to balance out.</p> <p><strong>Q:&#xa0;</strong>You had a successful career in the rail industry in the United States before coming to the UK, how does rail and public transport in the US compare with over here?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>This speaks to the wider perception of rail among British people. The public transport market in the UK is infinitely superior to the US. The great success in the US has been on the freight side. Passenger services, with the great exception of New York City, have largely been neglected.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>&#xa0;What is the international role model for rail that the UK should follow, and why?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Paradoxically, governments in international markets, and certainly in Europe, are looking to the UK model. So the whole impetus behind the single signalling solution of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rail_Traffic_Management_System\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">the European Rail Traffic Management System</a>, for instance, is an opening of the market and a separation between track and train - like in the UK. One of the reasons why the sovereign rail entities like Deutsche Bahn and SNCF are active in the UK market is that they want experience of it before it spreads through Europe.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong>&#xa0;If McNulty says the rail industry is too expensive, and you agree with that, why is it so costly and is it an inherent consequence of the fact that rail has three masters: franchisees, Network Rail and the Department for Transport?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>This is about the structure of the industry and making sure we have a better way of presenting choices to the government about how we spend its money on transport. Since the Strategic Rail Authority went away the government has not had as much assistance in helping it choose how to spend its rail budget. That is a role the Rail Delivery Group is hoping to fill. We will outline to the government the choices that it has. If we as a group continue to cooperate and work together - although the current environment will test that after the West coast mainline decision - then there could be a better way for industry to explain itself, and its costs, to the public.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>The train operators appear to have a bumpy relationship with Network Rail at the best of times. How will the RDG improve that?</p> <p><strong>A: </strong>Once the RDG is formalised, it will force Network Rail and the train operators to make the whole structure of the industry coherent. We do not want separate bodies, all of whom seem to have a separate piece of the industry. We want them organised into a more unified structure under the RDG, so we don't have an uncoordinated industry representing itself to the government and the public.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>&#xa0;You ran the London Underground for six years and your tenure was widely recognized as a great success. By extension, would a vertically integrated railway be a more successful structure?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> That's a generous depiction. Although I did not always work with a fully integrated underground [due to the failed PPP to upgrade and maintain the network], the integration of track and train had enormous advantages and I would not dispute that. The challenge facing the UK rail industry is a little different though. One of the things that a more diverse industry gives you is innovation and more answers. It is highly unlikely that if you put a monolith like British Rail in control you would have had the innovation that we have seen, that has driven record passenger numbers - one of the biggest increases in rail use modern history. A vertically integrated structure would not address the main challenges facing the British rail industry right now.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Ending \"trafficking\" is perhaps the most well-known, well-resourced, well-loved social cause of the 21st century that doesn't require its proponents' agreement on what it even is they wish to end. What is \"trafficking\"? How many people are \"trafficked\"? Look beyond the surface of the fight against trafficking, and you will find misleading statistics and decades of debate over laws and protocols. As for the issue itself, the lack of agreement on how to define \"trafficking\" hasn't slowed campaigners' fight. Rather, defining trafficking has become their fight.</p> <p>Over the last 15 years, anti-trafficking campaigns have ascended to the most visible ranks of feminist, faith and human rights missions, enjoying support from organizations as ideologically unneighborly as women's rights NGO Equality Now and the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation. The dominant contemporary understanding of trafficking took hold only around the turn of the century, driven in significant part by the advocacy of women's rights groups who sought to redefine trafficking specifically as the \"sexual exploitation\" of women and children. Indeed, this is the definition that groups like the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women succeeded in getting written into the <a href=\"http://www.uncjin.org/Documents/Conventions/dcatoc/final_documents_2/convention_%20traff_eng.pdf\">first international laws (pdf)</a> related to trafficking. When many people hear about \"trafficking\", this is the picture that comes to mind, and it is one that women's rights groups \u2013 and, increasingly, evangelical Christian groups like Shared Hope International, International Justice Mission and Love146 \u2013 use explicitly in their campaigning.</p> <p>In fact, it is with the influence of these groups that the issue of trafficking itself began to migrate: from relative obscurity, to sessions at the United Nations, to highways in the United States, where drivers now find anti-trafficking billboards featuring shadowy photographs of young girls, images meant to \"raise awareness\". Using such images in service of ending \"sexual exploitation\" may seem contradictory, as the girls photographed are presented in what would otherwise seem to be a quasi-pornographic setting. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/melissagira/status/244241917905346560\">A billboard I passed by last August on the interstate in Louisiana</a> showed a girl who looked sweaty and wide-eyed \u2013 only, with the words \"'NOT FOR SALE: END HUMAN TRAFFICKING\" stamped in red over her face.</p> <p>But what \u2013 and who \u2013 is being fought in what is pictured here?</p> <p>Accurate statistics on trafficking are difficult to come by, which does not stop some anti-trafficking groups from using them anyway. For instance, Shared Hope International, which is aggressively pursuing anti-trafficking legislation in 41 US states, claims \"<a href=\"http://www.sharedhope.org/WhatWeDo/Prevent/CommunityAwareness/DoyouknowLacy.aspx\">at least 100,000 juveniles are victimized</a>\" each year in the United States, and possibly as many as 300,000 \u2013 a figure that has been cited (<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/23/siu.selling.girl.next.door.judge/index.html?iref=allsearch\">repeatedly</a>) by CNN. In truth, the figure is an estimate from a <a href=\"http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/restes/CSEC_Files/Complete_CSEC_020220.pdf\">University of Pennsylvania report from 2001 (pdf)</a> of how many youth are \"at-risk\" of what its authors call \"commercial sexual exploitation of a child\", based on incidences of youth homelessness. But it was not a <em>count</em> of how many youth are victims of \"trafficking'\", or involved in the sex trade.</p> <p>Prostitution is often conflated with \"trafficking\" in these statistics, in part because the definition of trafficking that has been pushed to prominence refers exclusively to \"sexual exploitation\". In fact, this conflation has found its way into the collection of data: according to a report from the <a href=\"http://www.gaatw.org/\">Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[W]hen statistics on trafficking are available, they usually refer to the number of migrant or domestic sex workers, rather than cases of trafficking.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This purposeful conflation of sex work and trafficking distinguishes the many feminist and faith-based anti-trafficking groups that focus on sex-trafficking from groups that work directly with people who are involved in forced labor of all kinds, whether or not it involves sex work. This schism over who gets to define trafficking is about to come to a head <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-end-prop35-20121010,0,4382854.story\">for California voters in the form of Proposition 35</a>, which, if passed this November, will set higher criminal penalties and fines for those who commit what the authors of the bill define as sex-trafficking, as opposed to labor trafficking. It will also force those convicted of \"trafficking\" to register as sex offenders and submit to lifelong internet monitoring \u2013 whether or not sex or the internet were involved in their case.</p> <p>There is no question that California is home to several industries where, <a href=\"http://freedomnetworkusa.org/what-is-human-trafficking/human-trafficking-basics/\">according to the Freedom Network</a> (whose member organizations employ a human rights-based approach to anti-trafficking work), forced labor is known to occur: agricultural work, restaurant work, construction work, hotel work, garment work and sex work. But what unites the workers in these industries is not \"commercial sexual exploitation\", but the erosion of labor protections and the toughening-up of immigration policies \u2013 which makes many more people vulnerable to coercion and abuse. Cindy Liou, staff attorney at the <a href=\"http://www.apilegaloutreach.org/trafficking.html\">Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach</a>, a Northern California-based project that has worked with hundreds of survivors of human trafficking, is advocating for Californians to vote no on this proposition. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It redefines trafficking in a way that's incorrect, confusing, and terrible. It's highly problematic because it does this at the expense of all trafficking victims \u2013 it ignores labor trafficking victims.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In fact, so-called \"sex-trafficking\" constitutes only a small percentage of all forced labor, <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/Informationresources/ILOPublications/WCMS_181953/lang--en/index.htm\">as estimated by the International Labor Organization</a>. In their 2012 report, the ILO categorizes \"forced sexual exploitation\" as distinct from other kinds of forced labor, which, in some ways, is helpful as not all forced labor involves sex, and in other ways, adds more confusion to the issue (because what distinguishes \"sex-trafficking\" from sexual abuse is its occurrence within a workplace or work relationship). Still, of the nearly 21 million people the ILO estimates are forced laborers, 4.5 million are estimated to be what the ILO calls \"victims of forced sexual exploitation\" \u2013 that is, over three-quarters of the people around the globe estimated to be in forced labor are <em>not</em> involved in \"forced sexual exploitation\". By contrast, the ILO estimates that 2.2 million people worldwide are forced laborers in prisons or in the military \u2013 people whose stories we are quite unlikely to find on a highway billboard.</p> <p>But, as in the furor over \"sex-trafficking\", it would be wrong to let the volume of public outcry stand in for how significant a problem it is \u2013 however that issue is defined or ill-defined. Similarly, the push for \"real numbers\" can also lead us further into the ideological morass that itself defines the trafficking issue. Jo Doezema, a researcher with the Paulo Longo Research Initiative and author of Sex Slaves and Discourse Masters: The Construction of Trafficking, cautions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[E]ven a recognition that disputes over the meaning of trafficking involve politics and ideology does not go far enough: it still leaves intact the idea that trafficking can be defined satisfactorily, if political will, clear thinking, and practicality prevail.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is, there can be no assessment of the severity of \"trafficking\" if we define this issue by a simple and coherent accounting of \"victims\". What's lost in the relentless defining and counting are the complex factors behind what is now almost unquestioningly called \"trafficking\". Most of all, what is lost is any understanding or appreciation of the challenges faced by the millions of people working, struggling and surviving in abusive conditions, whose experiences will never fit on a billboard.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Editor's note: the photo caption originally stated that the ILO survey referred to trafficking victims; in fact, it refers to victims of forced labor, which may include trafficking victims, but it did not specifically attempt to count those.

  "<p>Writing on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/oct/05/green-investment-bank-caroline-lucas?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">green investment bank</a> a few weeks ago, I had been optimistic about the emergence of a cross-party consensus and the chances of a positive outcome. Unfortunately, as is so often the case in the House of Commons, what followed was more than a little disappointing.</p> <p>In last Wednesday's vote on the bank, MPs had the opportunity to amend the enterprise and regulatory reform bill by supporting two crucial changes: the ability to borrow from the capital markets by 2015 at the very latest, and ensuring the bank would actually invest in projects that would fit with the UK's climate change objectives.</p> <p>It proved a very frustrating day, not least because the government made sure that there was barely enough time to debate the amendments. In the 45 minutes allowed, there was only enough time for the minister and the opposition spokesperson, and no time at all for backbenchers to speak.</p> <p>Worse still, all the work by organisations and MPs behind the scenes to create a cross-party consensus evaporated in a cloud of political posturing.</p> <p>The bank must be able to borrow as soon as possible in order to take advantage of the current low cost of capital and to leverage in a large proportion of the private sector investment needed for the UK's low-carbon economy to flourish.</p> <p>But despite Labour talking passionately about the need for policy certainty and the need for the bank to borrow by 2015 at the latest (rather than the expected 2017), they seemed to ditch this view at the last minute. The Labour amendment included a caveat that reintroduced uncertainty and aligned their position with that of the Treasury.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats were hardly better. Just a few short weeks after a vote at their party conference to do exactly what my amendment proposed, the Liberal Democrats had a fit of amnesia and didn't take the opportunity to support it.</p> <p>Second, on the \"purposes\" of the bank: the green remit that the government has put forward for the bank to invest in is so wide that it is almost legally meaningless. There is a risk that it could even allow new fossil fuel power generation to receive support, which would be completely unacceptable.</p> <p>The amendment I tabled with other MPs would have required the bank's overall investment portfolio to increase the UK's ability to meet our carbon budgets. Importantly, it proposed an explicit link with the Climate Change Act, requiring the bank's board to consider advice from the Committee on Climate Change.</p> <p>Labour backed this amendment, but it was defeated because the Liberal Democrats opposed it, alongside the vast majority of Conservatives. Shockingly, a total of 292 MPs voted against ensuring that the investments made by the bank wouldn't undermine the UK's Climate Change Act.</p> <p>The CBI and many others in the business community have been vocal in recent weeks about the desperate need for certainty from ministers on the coalition's green policies \u2013 otherwise the investment needed for the green infrastructure of the future will simply not materialise.</p> <p>And yet, once again, MPs on all sides have allowed politics to get in the way of a good thing. The green investment bank could be at the heart of the green economy, but only if it lives up to its name.</p> <p>One piece of encouraging news did emerge on the day of the debate, but from outside Westminster. As part of the UK's state aid agreement with the European Union, the commission ruled out the possibility of the bank funding new nuclear power.</p> <p>Since the basic purpose of the bank is to support new and emerging innovative green industries \u2013 allowing them to grow and take advantage of new markets, and to be deployed at the pace and scale needed to meet our carbon targets \u2013 it's good news that nuclear, an old and failing technology, is now off the table.</p> <p>Now, in the months to come, I'll be doing all I can to ensure the bank can still reach its full potential. Next stop, the Lords \u2026</p>",
  "<p>For some young people reading can be a huge chore. Especially when at a touch of a button they have so many other ways of finding immediate entertainment through television, computers and mobile phones.</p> <p>It's not surprising then that the <a href=\"http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/research/nlt_research/4816_childrens_and_young_peoples_reading_today\">National Literacy Trust's recent research</a> revealed that more than half of young people prefer watching television to reading. However, young people's lack of enthusiasm for reading cannot simply be blamed on the distractions of modern technology. The National Literacy Trust research also found that 17% of young people are embarrassed to be seen reading a book and, since I began teaching, overcoming negative attitudes towards reading picked up during students' formative years remains one of the biggest challenges in getting them motivated to read.</p> <p>To tackle this it is important to work with parents, as well as students, and foster a positive attitude towards literature that pervades all areas of their lives, both inside and outside the classroom.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://bedfordacademy.co.uk/\">Bedford Academy</a> we have run many different initiatives to do this, such as encouraging parents to attend National Literacy Trust scheme sessions to involve them in their child's literacy development. We are also looking at ways to get parents involved with reading groups and support groups, so we can help parents who are not big readers themselves encourage their children to read. Students don't have to sit up all night gripped by a novel to prove they can enjoy reading. Being encouraged at home to read all forms of literature with confidence is as important as ensuring students are motivated by us at school.</p> <p>The structure of lessons at Bedford Academy are also designed around the idea of 'stage not age,' recognising that students develop at different rates and need different levels of support. Students who have low literacy levels have both timetabled literacy lessons and also after school classes at the end of the day. After all, how can you expect a student to make more progress than their peers in the same amount of lesson time?</p> <p>I think it is also vital to emphasise the importance of all forms of literature, from magazines and newspapers to ebooks and novels, exposing our young people to literature that is of interest to them or relevant to their lives, so they can begin to accept reading more readily. In particular, introducing Kindle and e-readers can target students who do not want to actually pick up a book, and harnesses the appeal of technology to enhance rather than distract from their reading pleasure.</p> <p>There are many different schemes that can complement the school curriculum, and the <a href=\"http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/premier_league_reading_stars_challenges\">National Literacy Trust's Premier League Reading Stars</a> has been a fantastic programme for encouraging some of our boys to read using the appeal of sport: a 10-week programme based on newspaper and magazine articles on sports stars to test student's literacy skills.</p> <p>Adapting this programme, we set our students the task of producing marketing materials on a speedway competition, which they had to present in front of a panel of judges at an actual speedway track. As well as testing their literacy skills, the project allowed students to develop their teamwork, project management and communication skills. By taking them outside a typical classroom environment, the exercise became much more memorable and a less daunting method of testing their literacy skills than perhaps reading a novel would be for some students.</p> <p>We also recently ran a media production and journalism programme after school to encourage reading through a creative angle, which also involved students' participation in the production of the school newsletter. Producing their news stories and seeing them published within the school community really encouraged students to step up to the mark to do themselves and the school proud, and opened their eyes to the power their literacy endeavors can have beyond the classroom.</p> <p>I think students sometimes feel that they have been forced in their academic and personal lives to read literature that they do not enjoy and so build up a negative attitude to all forms of literature. By bringing students into contact with literature that does appeal to them, and being able to see the benefits literacy will have on other areas of their lives, this negative attitude can be overcome, and once students have improved their literacy skills in one area, they are then able to access different levels of the whole curriculum.</p> <p><em>Claire Smith is principal of <a href=\"http://bedfordacademy.co.uk/\">Bedford Academy</a>.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/approximated-eu-ghg-inventory-2011/\" title=\"\">UK cut greenhouse gas emissions</a> by more than any other European country last year, over-achieving on targets under the <a href=\"]\" title=\"\">Kyoto protocol on climate change</a>. Some of the reduction was owing to <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/2012/winter.html\" title=\"\">milder weather</a> and an increase in renewable energy generation, but the sluggish economy is also likely to have contributed.</p> <p>France and Germany also made sizeable cuts in emissions, but Spain and Italy are lagging and are in danger of missing their Kyoto targets, according to <a href=\"http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/ghg-trends-and-projections-2012/\" title=\"\">figures released by the European Environment Agency</a> on Wednesday.</p> <p>The EU as a whole will meet its target under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kyoto-protocol?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">1997 treaty</a>, which requires developed countries to cut their emissions by a total of just over 5% from 1990 levels by the end of 2012. Currently, EU member states are the only major countries pledging to continue the Kyoto protocol beyond the end of this year, when its current provisions expire.</p> <p>Britain's emissions fell by 36m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2011, a 6% drop, while France's fell 5% and Germany's 2%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/connie-hedegaard?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Connie Hedegaard</a>, EU commissioner for climate action, said the EEA's research showed that it was possible to cut emissions while boosting economic growth. \"The EU is delivering on its Kyoto commitment,\" she said. \"While our economy grew 48% since 1990, emissions are down 18%. These figures prove once again that emissions can be cut without sacrificing the economy. Now, it is important to keep the direction.\"</p> <p>The EU is also on track to exceed its commitment, set out at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/copenhagen\" title=\"\">Copenhagen climate summit in 2009</a>, to cut emissions by 20% by 2020.</p> <p>But the EEA warned that Italy would not meet its Kyoto targets, and said Spain would have to revise its plans, on current form. While the bloc operates a \"burden-sharing\" agreement that means member states are mutually responsible for emissions reductions, member states with individual targets must also make efforts to meet them. If countries cannot cut their own emissions sufficiently, their only option is to buy \"carbon credits\" under the United Nations' emissions trading system.</p> <p>This could represent a substantial cost for the economies that are falling behind. Carbon prices are currently depressed, with credits changing hands for less than \u20ac5, but depending on the progress made on emissions, Italy and Spain could face a bill running into tens of millions at a time when their economies are already in deep trouble.</p> <p>However, this bill can be deferred \u2013 although the current commitment period under Kyoto comes to an end this year, countries can make up the deficit by buying credits until 2015.</p> <p>\"The European Union as a whole will over-deliver on its Kyoto target,\" said Jacqueline McGlade, executive director of the EEA. \"In two months' time we will be at the end of the first commitment period under the Kyoto protocol.

Politically, not so much; the figures will be out tomorrow and they will be whatever they are. We plebs can wait. But it does matter to markets; these figures are highly market sensitive, especially if they're better or worse than expected. And the exchange rate clearly did move at about the right time: there was a significant upward movement in the sterling/dollar rate that began shortly after 12pm (I chose that rate because the US markets haven't opened yet, so it's less likely to be distorted by other news than the sterling-euro rate) ...</p> <p>So if Nick Robinson's interpretation is that the PM was talking about the GDP figures, that's a problem. It&#xa0;undermines public trust in the independence and reliability of the official statistics, which in the long turn benefits nobody. So I don't think there's much point going on about the PM's possible but unprovable violation of the rules; or of trying to establish exactly what explains market movements.

Over the last two years we've had countless white papers, consultations, updates and even a draft bill, but not once have we seen anything that recognises the need for urgent reform or challenges the prices and practices of the big companies, or lives up to its name and genuinely reforms the energy market.</p> </blockquote> <p>To coincide with the debate, Labour has published <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/uploads/57e4ad64-60c7-31e4-35ce-400ed575ed04.pdf\">its own five-page document on energy policy (pdf).</a> Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A Labour Government would do three things to reform the energy market. We would abolish Ofgem and create a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall. We would require the energy companies to pool the power they generate and to make it available to any retailer, to open up the market and make it more transparent. We would also require energy companies to put all over-75s on their cheapest tariff, which could save as many as 4 million pensioners as much as \u00a3200 a year from their annual energy bills.</p> </blockquote> <p>Consumerism seems to be at the heart of Ed Miliband's politics at the moment and, reading Nick Robinson's cracking new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-From-Downing-Street-Robinson/dp/0593066804\">Live from Downing Street</a> (part lively, incisive potted history of the relationship between politicians and journalists, part colourful memoir of his experience as a broadcaster, including the obligatory \"how Peter Mandelson tried to get me sacked\" anecdote that features in all autobiographical books by contemporary political journalists), I came across an excellent phrase to describe this. It's \"Which? magazine socialism\". Robinson recalls hearing John Cole using the phrase shortly after the 1992 general election, in a private argument with Tony Blair in the On the Record green room after Blair gave an interview about how Labour needed to change. Cole was using the term to disparage the consumer-focused politics that Blair was championing. In retrospect, it does not seem a particularly good definition of Blairism (not least because it contains the word socialism). But if you look at the announcements that Miliband has been making on energy bills, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/29/miliband-attack-ripoff-pension-charges\">on pension fund charges</a>, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/rate-swap-scandal/9623036/Ed-Miliband-to-demand-FSA-acts-faster-on-missold-swaps.html\">on mis-selling by banks,</a> and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/sep/23/labour-aim-rail-energy-prices\"> on rail fares</a>, \"Which? magazine socialism\" sums it up perfectly.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T14:55:50.106Z\">at 3.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087ee6395cb4897f0db5262\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T13:34:28.076Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/audio/2012/oct/24/prime-ministers-questions\">Here's the Guardian audio from PMQs.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5087e32fb5794584b1c13ed8\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:47:49.519Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 David Cameron has rejected a call from the government\u2019s most senior law officer for Britain to obey the European court of human rights ruling saying the blanket ban on prisoner voting should be lifted.</strong> Giving evidence to the Commons justice committee this morning, Grieve said that Britain observed its international legal obligations, that ignoring international law would be a breach of the ministerial code, that ignoring the ruling would be \u201ccostly\u201d because the government would have to pay compensation to prisoners and that flouting the court could lead to Britain being expelled from the Council of Europe.

But, at PMQs, Cameron said prisoners would not be given the vote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No one should be in any doubt. Prisoners are not getting the vote under this government. I don\u2019t want prisoners to have the vote, and they should not have the vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>However Cameron did not rule out having another vote on the matter to allow parliament to express its view.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it helps by having another vote in Parliament on another resolution to make absolutely clear, to help put the legal position beyond doubt, I am very happy to do that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has announced that the Crown Prosecution Service will review its decision not to charge Jimmy Savile over alleged sexual abuse.</strong> He made the announcement at PMQs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The director of public prosecutions has confirmed that his principal legal adviser will again review the papers from the time when a case was put to the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] for prosecution. The director of public prosecutions specifically is going to consider what more can be done to alert relevant authorities where there are concerns that a prosecution is not taken forward. The government will do everything it can do, other institutions must do what they can do, to make sure that we learn the lesson of this and it can never happen again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has told MPs that Britain\u2019s economic prospects are improving.</strong> In a clear hint that tomorrow\u2019s GDP figures will show Britain is out of recession, Cameron told Ed Miliband: \u201cI can tell him, the good news will keep coming.\u201d Cameron also said that, overall, Britain was on the right track.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is what\u2019s happening in the country; inflation, down; unemployment, down; crime, down; waiting lists, down; borrowing, down.</p> </blockquote> <p>Number 10 later said Cameron\u2019s line about the good news still coming was not a reference to the growth figures, although the prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not deny that Cameron had seen the figures (which are released to key Whitehall figures 24 hours in advance). Miliband used PMQs to mock Cameron over the west coast mainline fiasco, over the energy announcement last week that subsequently had to be clarified and over the resignation of the chief whip. Miliband said the energy policy had \u201ctotally unravelled\u201d and was \u201canother dodgy offer from this prime minister\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has agreed to look into allegations that a paedophile network may have had links to a senior aide a former prime minister.</strong> The Labour MP Tom Watson raised the case during PMQs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The evidence file used to convict Peter Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring. One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister, who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad. The leads were not followed up, but if the files still exist, I want to ensure that the Metropolitan police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10.</p> </blockquote> <p>Watson did not name the senior aide, or the prime minister for whom he worked, and Cameron said he was not sure which prime minister Watson was referring to. But he said he would look at the case carefully and see if he could give Watson the assurances he wanted.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland?INTCMP=SRCH\">the controversy about Alex Salmond\u2019s allegedly lying over legal advice relating to Scottish independence</a> shows that the case for separation \u201ccompletely falls apart\u201d under scrutiny.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has refused to rule out introducing some form of statutory regulation following the publication of the Leveson report.</strong> When the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg asked him to accept that statutory press regulation was incompatible with a free press, Cameron refused. \u201cWhat matters most is that we have a regulatory system in which the public can have confidence,\u201d Cameron said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has said that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the way large multinational companies minimise their tax payments in the UK.</strong> Labour\u2019s Margaret Hodge said that Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starburks were avoiding tax worth nearly \u00a3900m. Cameron agreed this was a problem.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an international problem about how to make sure that companies pay tax in an appropriate way, I\u2019m not happy with the current situation, the HMRC needs to look at it, we need to make sure these companies are investing in our country but we need to make sure they are paying taxes as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/24/jimmy-savile-scandal-culture-secretary\">Maria Miller, the culture secretary, has defended her decision to write to the BBC about its handling of the Jimmy Savile controversy</a>.</strong> \u201cIt was right the government reflect the deep level of concern,\u201d she said today, in a move likely to escalate the row between the government and the BBC over this issue. In a separate development, the Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, a former BBC producer, said the Savile affair could lead to Chris Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, and George Entwistle, the director general, having to resign.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BBC management, over far too many years, has sought to maintain an imperious disdain for criticism and it has become clear that successive directors general have, while happy to criticise others for not answering difficult questions, either turned a blind eye to criminal activities or have not known what has been going on on their own doorstep, which is also culpable.</p> <p>It is as if your favourite and respectable aunt has been revealed to be on the game, and if Lord Patten is not able to grasp that, then I fear that not only the director general but also the chairman of the BBC Trust are going to have to fall on their swords.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 has said that the proposed 6.8% increase in the EU budget approved by MEPs yesterday is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.</strong> Asked about the vote in the European parliament yesterday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe think European budgets need to reflect the context, which is that countries across Europe are having to take some very tough decisions on public spending. I think we look at that proposal from the European parliament and it is just completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Theresa May, the home secretary, has said that the threat to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism has been downgraded from substantial to moderate.</strong> She made the announcement in a written statement to MPs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today the Security Service reduced the threat level to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism from substantial to moderate. This means that a terrorist attack is possible, but not likely. The threat level to the UK from international terrorism remains at substantial, which means that an attack is a strong possibility. The threat level to Northern Ireland from Northern Ireland-related terrorism remains at severe, meaning that an attack is highly likely. Neither of these two levels has changed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has called George Osborne a liar who is not up to the job of being chancellor.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/24/nadine-dorries-george-osborne-is-a-pernicious-influence-on-david-cameron_n_2007992.html?1351070858&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk-politics\"> an interview with the Huffington Post,</a> she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think George Osborne is out of his depth. He might be a politician and a strategist and a political campaigner. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s up to the job of being chancellor.</p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier this year Osborne said, in response to criticism from Dorries, that she had not agreed with anything he had done for the last seven years. Asked about Osborne\u2019s comment, she told the Huffington Post: \u201cOsborne lied when he said that. Osborne and I have worked together for years. We worked together in Oliver Letwin\u2019s office for three years, from 2001, when I wasn\u2019t an MP, and I got to know George Osborne quite well.

Actually what the United Kingdom should do is not specified and it is quite clear that there is a great deal of latitude in respect of what the United Kingdom can do in respect of implementing the Scoppola judgment ...</p> <p>The United Kingdom government is adherent to the convention. The convention is one of our international legal obligations. And successive governments, including this one, have always put a great emphasis on the observance of our international legal obligations. We live in a world where international law matters increasingly ... We do observe international obligations that are imposed on us.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Britain's reputation would suffer if it ignored the ruling.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The issue is whether the United Kingdom wishes to be in breach of its obligations, and what that does reputationally.</p> <p>Inevitably, if we were to be in default of a judgment in the European court of human rights, whilst clearly there would be some people who could put forward logical arguments as to why we should be, equally I have absolutely no doubt that it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said there was considerable flexibility in how the ruling could be implemented.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are numerous ways in which government or parliament might, could, if it wished to, approach the issue of change to the blanket ban, and that that approach need not necessarily be entirely in the direction that we have got to give more convicted prisoners the vote. There is an inbuilt flexibility in the&#xa0;Scoppola judgment which wasn\u2019t really present in [an early judgment from the court in this case].</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say whether there would be a draft bill published on the matter.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that ultimately parliament could decide to ignore the European court if it wanted.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is entirely a matter for parliament ultimately ... to determine what it wants to do. Parliament is sovereign in this area. Nobody can impose a solution on parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said ministers were obliged under the ministerial code to honour their international legal obligations.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But, as I say, the accepted practice is that the United Kingdom observes its international obligations. And that is something that is spelt out in a number of places, including the ministerial code.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected a suggestion from the Tory MP Nick de Bois that nothing would happen to the UK if it ignored the European court.</strong> In theory, the UK could even be thrown out of the Council of Europe, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not in a position to speculate one way or another what the outcome would be if the United Kingdom government and parliament decided not to respond to the&#xa0;Scoppola judgment. What would happen in practice is a matter of speculation ...</p> <p>As to what the end game would be, whether it would mean that the United Kingdom decided to leave the Council of Europe, or be expelled from the Council of Europe, I don\u2019t think I would wish to hazard a guess. But it is at least technically possible that a country that is in breach of its obligations can be removed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that this had only happened once, to Greece in the 1960s, after the military staged a coup.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said ignoring the ruling would be \"costly\" to the government.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s an issue, I think, that has been canvassed previously, that there would be damages claims stacking up against the United Kingdom government in respect of individual prisoners who would claim that their right to vote had been denied them.

They should also point out to ministers that since the division on votes for prisoners was a free vote - the government backed down after indications to the contrary, and some PPSs voted against the proposals - the practice should be repeated in the event of a bill: it would, in any event, be impossible to whip.

  "<p>Microsoft's Surface \u2013 the company's first tablet computer produced in-house, and a crucial part of the software giant's strategy to survive the decline of the PC \u2013 has been given a thumbs down by reviewers.</p> <p>Verdicts published overnight in the US, the first from journalists to have tested Surface at home, have praised its touchscreen interface but slated the machine for poor resolution, being too heavy, using substandard cameras, and having a narrow selection of apps which are prone to crashing.</p> <p>Reviewers are not urging readers to rush out and buy the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb\" title=\"\">\u00a3399</a> tablet, which is competing for attention not only with Apple's iPad and Google's Nexus 7, but Amazon's Kindle Fire in high definition.</p> <p>Wired reviewer <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/10/microsoft-surface/\" title=\"\">Mathew Honan</a> describes Surface as a tablet of both compromises and confusion, a puzzling machine which is designed both for consuming content like the iPad and for creating it like a traditional PC.</p> <p>The tablet will be available worldwide on Friday after Thursday's global launch of Windows 8, the most radical redesign of Microsoft's best-selling operating system since Windows 95 a full 17 years ago.</p> <p>Surface, which will only be available to buy online in the UK, runs on a version of Windows 8 called WindowsRT, and its interface is primarily designed for touch.</p> <p>However, it also comes with a keyboard \u2013 starting at \u00a399.99 for the touch version \u2013 and the basic Office software like Word, Excel and PowerPoint.</p> <p>\"Microsoft should have cleanly pulled the band-aid off and ditched the desktop metaphor altogether,\" Honan says.</p> <p>Surface is delightfully gesture friendly, but it does not compete with the iPad or the Kindle for reading, says Honan, because its long 10.6in screen and 1.5lb weight means it gets uncomfortable quickly.</p> <p>The two high definition cameras are described as junk, with some reviews claiming their pictures are grainy. But Honan's greatest criticism is reserved for the apps, or lack of them. \"You'll find a better selection of apps at your local TGI Friday's,\" he concludes.</p> <p>Microsoft's late arrival in the tablet space means few programmers have created content for the Windows 8 interface.</p> <p>There are just under 4,000 apps worldwide, compared to 275,000 for the iPad. Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and Angry Birds are all missing from the US store, according to the New York Times.</p> <p>The paper's reviewer, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/technology/personaltech/microsoft-unveils-the-surface-its-first-tablet-review.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">David Pogue</a>, says: \"Surface is a brilliantly conceived machine whose hardware will take your breath away \u2013 but whose software will take away your patience.\"</p> <p>He describes the device as a compromise: \"[Like] a stunning mansion on a bluff overlooking the sea \u2013 in Somalia\". The screen resolution does not compare with the new iPad's, (1,366 by 768 pixels compared to 2,048 by 1,536 pixels for the Apple product), making small type harder to use.</p> <p>There was also disappointment at the lack of a 3G or 4G connection \u2013 Surface connects to the internet via Wi-Fi only.</p> <p>Pogue complains about what he calls the tablet's insanely confusing split personality, moving back and forth between the fast, fluid and fun to use touch interface of the start screen to the old Windows desktop whenever the user fires up the Office programs.</p> <p>At technology site The Verge, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review\" title=\"\">Joshua Topolsky</a> that complained the kick stand, which pops out from the back of the machine to prop it upright like a picture frame, was sharp and scratched wooden surfaces.</p> <p>He was unimpressed with the Microsoft designed email service, describing it as slow to update and unresponsive to touch on a regular basis. Other apps, made by Microsoft and by third parties, could be slow to open, then stall or crash altogether.</p> <p>On balance, reviews of the touch interface were generally glowing, and battery life was not an issue \u2013 Microsoft's claim that Surface gives eight hours of intensive use was mostly exceeded.</p> <p>The Verge's conclusion: \"There may be a time in the future when all the bugs have been fixed, the third-party app support has arrived, and some very smart engineers in Redmond have ironed out the physical kinks in this type of product which prevent it from being all that it can be.</p> <p>\"But that time isn't right now \u2013 and unfortunately for Microsoft, the clock is ticking.\"</p>",

  "<p>The narrative was, perhaps, just a little too good to be true. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/nazi-buddha-statue-carved-from-meteorite\" title=\"\">news broke last month</a> of the so-called \"buddha from space\" \u2013 a swastika-emblazoned statue, apparently 1,000 years old, that had been carved out of a meteorite and looted by a Nazi ethnologist \u2013 the world was enthralled.</p> <p>There were only, it turns out, a few slight catches. According to two experts who have since given their verdict on the mysterious Iron Man, it may have been a European counterfeit; it was probably made at some point in the 20th century; and it may well not have been looted by the Nazis. The bit about the meteorite, though, still stands.</p> <p>According to Buddhism specialist Achim Bayer, the statue bears 13 features which are easily identifiable by experts as \"pseudo-Tibetan\" \u2013 and which sit uneasily with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19735959\" title=\"\">speculation by researchers last month</a> that it was probably made in the 11th-century pre-Buddhist Bon culture.</p> <p>These include the 24cm-high statue's shoes, trousers and hand positioning, as well as the fact that the buddha has a full beard rather than the \"rather thin\" facial hair usually given to a deity in Tibetan and Mongolian art. In his report, Bayer says he believes the statue to be a European counterfeit made sometime between 1910 and 1970.</p> <p>\"I would like to briefly address readers from outside our field and clarify that there is not any controversy among experts about the authenticity of the statue, the 'lama wearing trousers', as I would like to call it,\" writes the University of Seoul academic. \"Up to date, no acknowledged authority in the field of Tibetan or Mongolian art has publicly deemed the statue authentic and the issue has to be considered uncontroversial.\"</p> <p>The statue's Asian provenance is not the only aspect of the story to have been questioned. In September, the man leading a team of German and Austrian researchers, University of Stuttgart geologist Elmar Buchner, said its previous owner had claimed it had been brought to Europe in the late 1930s by Ernst Sch\u00e4fer, a Nazi ethnologist who led an SS expedition to Tibet.</p> <p>But German historian Isrun Engelhardt, who has studied Sch\u00e4fer's trip to Tibet in depth, has cast doubt on this suggestion, questioning the statue's absence on the long list of items brought back. \"There is an extremely precise list of the purchased objects, including date, place and value,\" she told Spiegel.</p> <p>Buchner says he had no reason to doubt the account of the previous owner, and stresses that his team was only looking into what the statue was made of \u2013 a rare form of iron with a high content of nickel \u2013 not where it had come from. While they felt able to say the material most likely came from the Chinga meteorite, which crashed to earth 15,000 years ago, the researchers admitted that \"the ethnological and art historical details \u2026 as well as the time of sculpturing, currently remain speculative\".</p> <p>Moreover, Buchner's statements about the origins were qualified. He told the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science: \"If we are right that it was made in the Bon culture in the 11th century, it is absolutely priceless and absolutely unique worldwide.\"</p>",

  "<p>In a converted 1871 grain storage facility near Rio de Janeiro's old waterfront docks, I joined my fellow <a href=\"http://www.nesst.org\" title=\"\">NESsT</a> staff from 11 different countries to transform an empty historical building to a sustainably designed venue in a matter of days. Helping us celebrate 15 years, we hosted this year's annual <a href=\"http://www.nesst.org/sewf/\" title=\"\">Social Enterprise World Forum (SEWF2012)</a>, and chose the theme Impact Investing to enhance the sector's financial resources and multi-sector collaboration. Coming from 38 countries, we convened almost 700 delegates, 180 speakers and 55 university scholars for a week filled with various strategic and hands-on sessions. The following are eight key highlights, categorised in the same core themes of the event's different tracked sessions.</p> <h2><strong>1. Finance and investment</strong></h2> <p>On the funding side, we saw the potential of crowd-funding to deliver funding to micro-entrepreneurs, creative thinkers, and social businesses through organisations like <a href=\"http://catarse.me/en\" title=\"\">Catarse</a>, <a href=\"http://www.itsnoon.net/\" title=\"\">Itsnoon</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.aliancaempreendedora.org.br/\" title=\"\">Alian\u00e7a Emprendedora</a>. Philanthropy and impact investing are part of a financial toolkit focused on delivering social change. Philanthropy is indispensable, and impact investing provides a tremendous opportunity to scale social enterprises.</p> <h2><strong>2. Social enterprise in Brazil</strong></h2> <p>Focusing on how to enhance the social enterprise sector in Brazil, the forum invested 75% of the event budget in local social enterprise vendors. There is a need to develop a greater pipeline of social enterprises for impact investing. We also need to align investor and social enterprise expectations. We need to increase earlier enterprise investment readiness and investors should be prepared to take risks and invest at the early stage.</p> <h2><strong>3. Leadership development and education</strong></h2> <p>Universities can play an important role in building the social enterprise field, and a standardised curriculum for teaching social enterprise should be developed by multidisciplinary teams from various sectors \u2013 one that is focused on technology and also has students doing classwork in the field working with social enterprises.</p> <h2><strong>4. Social justice and economic opportunity</strong></h2> <p>Collaborative research, monitoring and evaluation should be encouraged where social enterprise practitioners and beneficiaries provide insights and data that can be expanded upon by the research community and shared with the sector as a whole. Former president of Chile and current under-secretary-general and executive director, UN Women, <a href=\"http://ow.ly/eAe0k\" title=\"\">Michelle Bachelet</a>, said: \"Invest in women; women are natural social entrepreneurs.\"</p> <h2><strong>5. Environment</strong></h2> <p>Building on the Rio+20 conference in June, where Nicole Etchart, my co-chief executive, urged policy makers and impact investors to encourage \"an enabling environment that helps businesses to grow,\" the forum included elements such as an Investor Day, a Pitching Place and specific sessions led by corporate and financial leaders to develop social enterprise. New government procurement and regulatory practices are also fostering social enterprises and is becoming a vehicle to attract capital, without stifling the development of new models.</p> <h2><strong>6. Management and skills-building</strong></h2> <p>We need to commit to building capacity of social entrepreneurs. For example, it is crucial they can pitch effectively to both investors and all different relevant audiences. Social entrepreneurs should always be ready with three versions of their pitch, making sure to say, in the first minute, what the product or service is, and how much funding the enterprise needs. First, they should have a one-sentence pitch; second, a 45 second-pitch; and third, the full pitch.</p> <h2><strong>7. Innovation, invention and design</strong></h2> <p>Innovation creates impact only when it is put in practice and responds to market and social needs. Innovators need capital, capacity support and networks, and they should partner with universities and for-profit organisations, and use design thinking and its human-centered approach to increase the chances of success.</p> <h2><strong>8. Social enterprise cases and models</strong></h2> <p>These sessions presented various case studies sharing both the social enterprise and investor perspective. In the same integrated way, we need to invest, test and share industry knowledge from all different perspectives.</p> <p><em>Lo\u00efc Comolli is co-chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.nesst.org\" title=\"\"><em>NESsT</em></a><em> and is responsible for the overall strategic direction of NESsT and mobilizing financial resources to fund the organisation's growth.

  "<h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Jimmy Savile was an eccentric British DJ, TV host and a tireless charity worker who was a big media personality in the UK for close to 40 years. When he died, aged 84 in October 2011, the former coal miner was one of Britain\u2019s most well-known personalities, famous for his trademark fat cigar and garish tracksuits.</p> <p>Savile was a Catholic teetotaller who worshipped his mother and was knighted for his charitable work in 1990, the same year he was given a papal knighthood by pope John Paul II. But, unbeknown to most people, Savile was a paedophile, and police believe he used his position to abuse hundreds of children across the UK.</p> <p>A year after Savile\u2019s death, Scotland Yard revealed it had launched an investigation into his involvement in allegations of child sex abuse \u201con an unprecedented scale\u201d.</p> <p>Jim\u2019ll Fix It, Savile\u2019s most famous show, was a ratings hit and a family favourite, broadcast in the Saturday \u201cteatime\u201d slot \u2013 a prestigious spot for British broadcasters\u2019 flagship shows. The programme involved Savile making people\u2019s (usually children\u2019s) dreams come true.</p> <p>The BBC, the UK\u2019s most respected media organisation, is now accused of having, at the very least, turned a blind eye to allegations of Savile\u2019s behaviour \u2013 some of which is said to have occurred on its premises to children Savile had met on his shows. An investigation by the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme was scrapped amid allegations of pressure from senior executives. The BBC said it was dropped because of editorial reasons.</p> <p>Lord Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, the BBC\u2019s governing body, has spoken of a \u201cthe appalling allegations, the cesspit of the Jimmy Savile allegations\u201d. John Simpson, veteran BBC foreign correspondent and one of Britain\u2019s most respected journalists, has called the scandal \u201cthe worst crisis that I can remember in my nearly 50 years at the BBC\u201d. Prime minister David Cameron has said: \u201cThe nation is appalled by the allegations of what Jimmy Savile did, and they seem to get worse by the day.\u201d</p> <h2>The victims</h2> <p>So far 12 victims are believed to have come forward and are considering legal action against the BBC and others. Scotland Yard has said Savile may have been at the centre of a network of paedophiles who targeted more than 200 victims. Police are investigating whether he had accomplices: former pop star and convicted paedophile Gary Glitter is alleged to have raped a 13-year-old girl in a BBC dressing room.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/11/jimmy-savile-sex-abuse-claims\">According to reports</a>, Savile abused sick and disabled children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Berkshire, a hospital that was the beneficiary of millions of pounds raised by Savile, and where he boasted he had his own bedroom. The hospital has said it has \u201cno record\u201d of complaints about him.</p> <h2>The BBC</h2> <p>The British Broadcasting Corporation is an organisation as central to life in the UK as the National Health Service. While it is not in the strict sense a state broadcaster, it is funded by a compulsory \u00a3145.50 ($231.79) TV license. While the broadcaster is held in so much affection that its nickname is \u201cAuntie\u201d, it is also an object of fierce criticism from media rivals who argue that the TV levy has given the BBC an unfair commercial advantage.</p> <p>The Savile scandal has prompted a fierce debate about the culture of the BBC, an institution run by \u201ccontrol freaks and cowards\u201d according to the newspaper columnist Max Hastings.</p> <p>Criticism is just as strong within the BBC. Reporters on Newsnight, the BBC\u2019s flagship and often hard-hitting current affairs show, have said they believe their editor, Peter Rippon, was under pressure from BBC bosses to drop an investigation into the allegations. Rippon wrote a blog post about the dropping of the show that contained a number of inaccuracies and has been described as a \u201cmatter of regret and embarrassment\u201d by BBC director general George Entwistle. A rival BBC show, Panorama, this week broadcast a film that detailed the tensions within the BBC over the Newsnight report.</p> <h2>What now?</h2> <p>The British police and the BBC are now conducting formal investigations into the allegations. Under questioning from members of parliament, Entwistle was accused of \u201can extraordinary lack of curiosity\u201d when first told about Newsnight\u2019s Savile investigation. Entwistle was not directly responsible for Newsnight at the time but he did have responsibility for BBC1, which was planning a Savile tribute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398308463\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/17/1345203790511/Mark-Thompson-To-Leave-BB-004.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Thompson To Leave BBC In Autumn 2012\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Thompson, the outgoing director general of the BBC, claimed for a return flight to New York in February that cost more than \u00a33,000.

It\u2019s worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC has some \u201cvery big questions\u201d to answer, according to John Whittingdale, the chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee in the British parliament</p>",
  "<p>Food, the bedrock of life and the foundation of our physical, spiritual and emotional wellbeing, is at the heart of many of the critical environmental and social challenges we face in the 21st century. And the need for addressing the interlinked challenges of hunger and sustainability must be among our top priorities.</p> <p>Put this in the context of a population that will reach some 9 billion by 2050 and changing dietary patterns, particularly in China and parts of the Far East, and the challenge becomes even more daunting. Land and water are key limiting factors here; agriculture already dominates two thirds of ice-free land and continues to be a key driver of habitat and ecosystem loss across the globe. Global forest loss is continuing at a rate of some 130,000 sq km/year, equivalent to an area roughly the size of England and we are literally eating into the natural capital on which our agricultural system depends.</p> <p>Over the last 50 years or so agriculture has arguably served us well in terms of meeting the needs of providing food for growing populations with shifting dietary needs, with many of us spending significantly less of our weekly pay packets, proportionately, on our shopping baskets. This has of course been at a cost, with our natural resource base used at unsustainable rates.</p> <p>So how does global agriculture need to adapt to the challenges of the future and move towards sustainable practices? I would argue that we need to focus on principles that can be applied to many farming systems rather than a never ending and sometimes polarised debate about which farming system is best suited to feed the world within environmental limits.</p> <p>There is never going to be a single silver bullet and sustainable farming systems of the future are going to need to reflect very different political, cultural and social situations. Whether these are organic farmers or inorganic farmers, small scale subsistence farmers in Africa or larger scale farms in the American mid-west, they will all have an important role to play.</p> <p>Sustainable farming systems need to encompass three key factors. They need to be environmentally sound, socially responsible and economically viable. By taking this approach, all farming systems need to consider a certain set of basic principles, which will of course vary slightly depending on context, but may help us set a direction of travel towards more sustainable practices.</p> <p>From an environmental perspective, for example, these could include the need for farming systems to address soil health and erosion, carbon sequestration, waste production or to consider agro-ecological processes that employ closed loop cycles within the farm wherever possible to limit inputs and reduce waste. Examples here include nutrient cycling (macro and micro), biological nitrogen fixation, predation and symbiosis.</p> <p>Another obvious principle would be reducing environmental impacts and enhancing our natural capital, building on key environmental services on which our food system depends. From a social perspective, using this principles based approach, farming systems may still need to address issues such as respecting the rights of local people \u2013 rights to land, water, food and access to markets and the right to decision making.</p> <p>Strengthening the protection of the human rights of land users, including internationally-recognised labour standards and improved outcomes for marginalised groups within the food system (particularly women and children in developing countries through education and empowerment) would be another obvious social principle which should underpin sustainable farming systems.</p> <p>Economically, farming systems could follow principles based on the need for resilient, efficient, productive and profitable farms which provide fair returns to farm labour, land and invested capital. There are potentially many more principles that could apply here and I have just given a few potential examples, but surely this is the most appropriate way forward?</p> <p>The principle of reducing closed loop systems and reducing waste is also an obvious one that applies to all farming methods. One of the biggest issues confronting small scale farmers in Africa, for example, is the issue of post-harvest losses, due to lack of adequate storage facilities or poor access to local markets. While in theory the solutions on the ground seem obvious in practice it's far more complex; farmers often struggle to access advice or more importantly microfinance schemes to build grain storage facilities.</p> <p><strong>Examples on the ground</strong></p> <p>There are many great examples of sustainable farming systems in practice. WWF is working with farmers, scientists and national institutions <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?uNewsID=114481\" title=\"\">in India to promote a System of Rice Intensification</a> (SRI) as an option to reduce pressure on freshwater ecosystems and improve food production and the profitability of rice farmers involved.</p> <p>Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world's population. In Asia alone, more than 2 billion people obtain 60-70% of their calories from rice and its products. Rice farmers, big and small, play a crucial role in ensuring global food security. After all, it is farmers in the developing world who are the key to solving hunger crisis in the developing world, using sustainable methods of production most appropriate to their needs.</p> <p>Politicians, governments, businesses and civil society need to work more collaboratively to find principles based solutions. This approach may require a new emphasis on issues such as knowledge exchange, so that there is better co-ordinated research efforts and improvements to the way in which research and advice is shared or exchanged throughout the food, farming and environment sectors and between the developed and developing world.</p> <p>The issue of integrated pest management and minimum tillage is an example here where research suggests that this can deliver both environmental and economic benefits. What is required is knowledge exchange mechanisms that can look at improved understanding and uptake of these.</p> <p>Across all farming systems, we should be talking about efficiency of production or productivity measured in terms of output per unit input, linked to rewarding producers with fair prices and for a range of other environmental and social goods and services. There has been much recent debate about exactly how much we need to increase production to feed the world in the future; whether its 10% or 60%, one of the key challenges in terms of global food security is access to and distribution of this food.</p> <p>Today we produce enough food in the world to feed everyone with a nutritious and adequate diet. Ultimately of course, we will only move to fairer and more sustainable farming systems globally if we address some of the structural barriers that will enable farmers across the world to do this \u2013 and here of course the role of food businesses, the retail sector and governments are key.</p> <p><em>Mark Driscoll is </em><a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/what_we_do/about_us/building_a_one_planet_future.cfm\" title=\"\"><em>WWF-UK's One Planet</em></a><em> Food Lead</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A coat made from a duvet complete with removable cover; a jumper made from eight pairs of socks and a leather dress inspired by a car seat cover. These items of clothing, as odd as they might sound, are not the latest avant-garde catwalk looks or a spin on recycling chic. Instead, these they swing on the rails of H&amp;M. These bold pieces, in stores in November, feature in the Swedish shop's most conceptual fashion collaboration to date, with Maison Martin Margiela, a brand more accustomed to Paris fashion week than the high street.</p> <p>On Tuesday, to celebrate this off-kilter union, a nine storey derelict building in downtown Manhattan was transformed into a series of installations. Models, fashion designers and celebrities, including Sarah Jessica-Parker and Julianne Moore, entered on a concrete walkway, a typically Margiela spin on the red carpet.</p> <p>Strip lights, peeling paint and crumbling walls epitomised the brand's aesthetic. Models wearing clothes from the H&amp;M collection cavorted in white powder, which had been dusted on to large squares on the floor, creating impromptu artworks. These performances were in keeping with a label not known for the conventional catwalk experience.</p> <p>\"So many clothes look the same now, and actually they're quite easy when you put them on,\" says Margareta van den Bosch, creative adviser for H&amp;M of this latest collection, which follows previous hit collaborations with the likes of Karl Lagerfeld, Stella McCartney and Versace. \"Oversizing and the hand-craft look \u2013 things they [Maison Martin Margiela] play with \u2013 are also in fashion at the moment, so it's really not so strange,\" she said.</p> <p>Made up of 40 items for women and 30 for men, all of which are based on original pieces from the 23-year-old Margiela archive, more wearable styles, such as wool coats, coated denim and tailoring, will also go on sale. A range of stand-out accessories, including metallic sweetie-wrapper clutch bags, horse hair necklaces, hi-top trainers and \"invisible heels\", where a wedge made of Plexiglass is designed to give the impression that the wearer is walking on air, looks set to be a hit with shoppers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398276062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351073908025/Perfomance-for-the-Maison-008.jpg\" alt=\"Perfomance for the Maison Martin Margiela with H&M Global Fashion Event in New York\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfomance for the Maison Martin Margiela with H&M Global Fashion Event in New York Photograph: H&M</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H&amp;M</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Each piece will come with a label telling the wearer which year and from which collection the garment originates from. \"Everything has been created from the original sketches and cut as they were originally seen on the catwalk,\" explains a representative from team Maison Martin Margiela. \"There were some compromises on materials and price. So what was originally a fur coat is now a faux fur coat and so on.\"</p> <p>Belgian designer Margiela founded the label in 1988 in Paris. He studied at the influential Antwerp Royal Academy before going on to assist Jean Paul Gaultier. In contrast to the \"star designer\" behaviour of his peers, Margiela created an enigmatic persona for himself. He wasn't photographed, he didn't take catwalk bows and he only gave interviews via fax. Between 1997 and 2003 he also designed the women's collections at Herm\u00e8s. It is reported that the designer left the brand he created during 2009.</p> <p>Despite being responsible for some of fashion's most extreme statements, including a jacket made of pen lids, clothes sprayed with mould or cardigans crafted from bin bags, the label's overall aesthetic has been popular with both the high street and other contemporary designers. Ideas, such as wonky hems, exaggerated volumes, experiments with masculine-feminine tailoring and exposed stitching, all central to the brand, have been particularly influential across the fashion spectrum.</p> <p>The idea of bringing the label's groundbreaking concepts to a new audience via H&amp;M is a particularly savvy idea. In 2011, Versace's H&amp;M range injected new buzz into the label while bringing with it new customers. Collaborations with Anna Dello Russo, Marni and Karl Lagerfeld have also been a success. A spokesperson for Margiela explains: \"When Martin Margiela was at the house, he designed something separately for a French catalogue called Trois Suisse. So really from the beginning there has always been the idea that we want as many people as possible to know what we do.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK government needs to rethink its education programmes to better support marginalised children and young people in accessing education in poorer countries, according to a report published by the Global Campaign for Education (GCE) UK on Wednesday.</p> <p>The report, <a href=\"http://files.groupspaces.com/GCEUK/files/540050/Equity+%26+Inclusion+for+All+in+Education%2C+GCE+UK+2012.pdf\" title=\"\">Equity and inclusion for all in education</a> (pdf), analysed 14 of the Department for International Development's (DfID) operational plans. It found that, while the department has a clear mandate to ensure girls attend school, there is little evidence that it is addressing barriers to education faced by young people with disabilities, or those from particular religious minorities or ethnic groups. The needs of children living in vulnerable situations or locations, such as on the streets or in informal settlements, are likewise receiving too little attention, according to the study.</p> <p>Getting more girls into school has been a priority for donors to achieve the second and third millennium development goals, on universal primary education and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/aug/05/millennium-development-goal-gender-equality\" title=\"\">gender equality</a> respectively. The <a href=\"http://www.ungei.org/whatisungei/index_211.html\" title=\"\">UN girls' education initiative</a> was established in 2000 to accelerate progress in these areas.</p> <p>But the report noted that, while \"some of DfID's education work appears to tackle some aspects of marginalisation beyond concerns around gender\", this was \"not the same as ensuring that all education initiatives prioritise addressing the rights of all marginalised groups in a comprehensive and co-ordinated way\".</p> <p>The GCE is calling on the department to develop a clear strategy to ensure equity and the inclusion of all marginalised groups across all the countries in which it works; invest in research and programmes that promote inclusion; support civil society groups in their work with marginalised young people; and ensure that support for private sector initiatives does not undermine young peoples' right to education.</p> <p>The report examined DfID in Bangladesh, Burma, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Vietnam, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda, although researchers noted that some information about the programmes could not be downloaded on the DfID website. This, they said, \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/oct/17/open-government-data-pdfs\" title=\"\">raises concerns</a> in regard to the transparency of DfID's project implementation and dissemination of results\".</p> <p>The GCE found that in some countries, including Zambia, Tanzania and Vietnam, DfID programmes that had improved attainment for girls had also improved outcomes for other vulnerable groups. But the absence of a comprehensive strategic approach meant outcomes were fragmented.</p> <p>The report questioned DfID's support for private-sector involvement in education, querying how this approach promoted inclusion. The researchers found no direct evidence from the operational plans that support for private-sector involvement in education had a positive or negative impact on marginalisation. But they questioned how DfID regulated the private sector, and asked what evidence the department had to justify this approach.</p> <p>\"Arguments against the promotion of low-cost private education note that it is less likely to ensure equity, sustainability and accountability, or offer scaled provision of education,\" said the report. \"Private education is also likely to lead to rural areas becoming increasingly marginalised in a scenario whereby profitability begins to determine the location of schools; poor families are likely to become more marginalised as school fees begin to divert income from other priorities.\"</p> <p>Sunit Bagree, Sightsavers policy adviser and co-author of the report, said Britain's policy needed a rethink. \"Although DfID's focus on increasing the number of girls in education is welcome, government policy is failing other marginalised groups such as disabled children, ethnic minorities, street children and those living in very remote areas,\" he said. \"For example, being disabled more than doubles the chance of never enrolling in school in some countries, yet we know that education is a fundamental route out of poverty. Unless DfID urgently reviews its policies and starts meeting the needs of marginalised children, progress on reaching the goal of universal primary education by 2015 will stall.\"</p> <p>A DfID spokeswoman said the UK government is committed to helping all poor children get a good quality education, including the most marginalised, adding that by 2015, it would be supporting 9 million children to go to primary school, more than half of them girls.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Mann, a scientist at the centre of the \"climate wars\", has sued a rightwing thinktank and a magazine for comparing him to the convicted sex offender and disgraced football coach Jerry Sandusky and accusing him of academic fraud.</p> <p>Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, announced the defamation lawsuit against the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) and the National Review in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MichaelMannScientist/posts/437351706321037\" title=\"\">a posting on his Facebook page on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://legaltimes.typepad.com/files/michael-mann-complaint.pdf\" title=\"\">37-page complaint</a> arises from blog posts published last July, and accuses National Review and CEI of recycling \"false and defamatory statements\" about Mann's research.</p> <p>Mann, the author of the iconic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_controversy\" title=\"\">hockey stick graph</a> showing a sharp uptick in global temperatures after 1900, has come under repeated attack from climate contrarians.</p> <p>He has been cleared of academic wrongdoing by seven separate investigations, but the attacks have persisted \u2013 culminating in last July's blogs which likened Mann to Sandusky.</p> <p>A post on the CEI blog referred to Mann as \"the other scandal\" at Penn State and accused the scientist of \"molesting data\" about climate change. The sentences likening Mann to Sandusky were later removed.</p> <p>National Review later picked up the post, although the writer added a minor caveat.</p> <p>\"Despite their knowledge of the results of these many investigations, the defendants have nevertheless accused Dr Mann of academic fraud and have maliciously attacked his personal reputation with the knowingly false comparison to a child molester. The conduct of the defendants is outrageous, and Dr Mann will be seeking judgement for both compensatory and punitive damages,\" Mann's Facebook page said.</p> <p>Mann said the lawsuit was part of a larger effort by scientists to push back against the attacks on climate science.</p> <p>Another new front was opened up in that broader fight, with the release of a report by climate contrarians intended to undermine an authoritative US government study on the effects of climate change.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://wwwp.dailyclimate.org/tdc-newsroom/2012/10/cato-climate-science-report\" title=\"\">Daily Climate reported</a> that another rightwing thinktank in Washington, the Cato Institute, planned to put out its own version of a landmark US government climate science report \u2013 aimed at discrediting mainstream climate science.</p> <p>The Cato report appears almost identical to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jun/16/climate-change-sea-level\" title=\"\">a 2009 study detailing the effects of climate change on the US</a>.

  "<p>Jeremy Paxman has made history by appearing on Newsnight this week <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2222112/So-Mr-Paxman-tieless-TV-Presenter-opts-open-neck-look-hosts-Newsnight.html\" title=\"\">without a tie</a>. Traditionally, male news presenters across all television channels wear ties, because it conveys the necessary air of authority and respectability that viewers might expect when receiving serious information. But Paxman is a maverick who plays by his own rules; it's worth noting that he went one step further than just ditching his neckwear, by leaving not one but two buttons undone on his shirt. Did he think he could revolutionise television protocol in one fell swoop? Probably, because that's the kind of chap he is.</p> <p>In 2007, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/07/time_to_go_tieless.html\" title=\"\">Paxman wrote on the BBC website</a>: \"Is it time for Newsnight men to stop wearing ties? It has always been an utterly useless part of the male wardrobe. But now, it seems to me, the only people who wear the things daily are male politicians, the male reporters who interview them \u2013 and dodgy estate agents.\" Yet it has taken him five years to put his money where his mouth is, so he clearly has felt duty bound to follow the rules of his profession \u2013 until now. Politicians like to bury bad news stories about their party when a huge global disaster suddenly dominates the media, releasing them at a carefully chosen time. Perhaps Paxman used the BBC's current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/blog/2012/oct/24/jimmy-savile-scandal-bbc-awful?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">huge PR disaster</a> to bury his hated collection of ties?</p> <p>The BBC has always seen itself as the maintainer of standards, both moral and sartorial. There is a photograph from the 1930s of a newsreader reading the news in full morning dress and spats \u2013 for <em>radio</em>. This is what we expect from the BBC. We might expect to see a Channel 5 newsreader in a T-shirt and jeans, but not under Auntie's watch.</p> <p>However, there are actually no strict guidelines governing how BBC presenters should dress. Former head of presentation Mike Kavanagh, when once asked whether there were any formal guidelines about what BBC staff have to wear, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_4330000/newsid_4339900/4339987.stm\" title=\"\">replied</a>: \"The most important point to make is that a presenter's clothes should not distract the viewer from the news. Our presenters should wear modern, stylish clothes which fit well. We want our presenters to be warm and engaging with the audience and well-styled clothes can help the presenters achieve this.\"</p> <p>In other words, Paxman is not such a maverick after all. He is proving a common misconception about dress codes: the Newsnight viewers who have complained about his lack of neckwear labour under the misapprehension that the BBC imposes a dress code on its presenters. It is very similar to the English National Opera making a big fuss about young folk <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/eno-dress-opera-formal-wear\" title=\"\">being allowed to the opera in casual dress</a>, even though there was never a dress code for opera in the first place; people assume that you have to wear white or black tie, but it's just tradition.</p> <p>Ultimately, viewers want to see politicians squirm under Paxman's angry and informed interrogations \u2013 and if he prefers to ditch his tie in order to fire himself up for that task, then let him be.</p>",
  "<h2>Brand campaign and marketing</h2> <p>Guardian News &amp; Media has a strong desire to increase its audience in order to spread its unique blend of liberal journalism as well as to maximise commercial opportunities.</p> <p>But we are not prepared to do this at any cost and the Guardian has avoided using the cult of celebrity to maximise our online audience.</p> <p>In fact, GNM has made it clear that it does not want to be all things to all people but concentrate on attracting a progressive audience who feel in tune with our core values.</p> <p>To aid this process, the marketing department, for the first time in more than 25 years, developed a brand campaign aimed at demonstrating the Guardian's values and unique form of open journalism.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/advertising/the-whole-picture\">The Whole Picture campaign</a> launched on 29 February with a two-minute TV spot, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/feb/29/open-journalism-three-little-pigs-advert\">The Three Little Pigs</a>. The film ran on Channel 4-owned stations for four weeks, as well as playing nationally in cinemas. It was also hosted on YouTube, Facebook and at&#xa0;theguardian.com/open. </p> <p>The response to the campaign has been extraordinary. The film kick started global debates about the future of news reporting, about open vs closed, about citizen journalism, about the digital future and about the role of great advertising.&#xa0;</p> <p>We were thrilled that the debates weren't confined to the media village; rather they involved a range of schools, universities, Facebook groups as well as other news organisations. We were equally pleased that this wasn't just a UK conversation: the spread of online views from all around the world shows that there is universal interest.&#xa0;It has become by far the most viewed film we have ever made, with more than two million views online alone.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Marketing footprint</h2> <p>The consumer marketing department has been working with Envido, a carbon solutions company and PHD, our media buyers, to measure the carbon output of our bought media. This is the first step towards being aware of the CO<sub>2</sub> impact of our marketing and how our decisions affect GNM's overall carbon footprint.<br>&#xa0;<br>A retrospective report of media buying in 2010 showed less than 1% of the Guardian's operational footprint could be attributed to media buying. However, what is crucial is understanding how we make better decisions and not simply report a number. </p> <p>In 2012 we are again running this analysis, but we want to understand better where the high-risk emission areas are in each form of advertising TV, radio, billboards etc). We continue to work with PHD to take forward learnings, without affecting campaign reach or impact. </p> <p>We are also planning to engage our creative agencies in this project. This means we will be measuring the carbon footprint of our Whole Picture campaign. <br>&#xa0;<br>At the same time,&#xa0;many media owners are already taking substantial steps to reduce their carbon output. This knowledge will be used by GNM and PHD in the briefing process to make responsible and informed decisions.</p>",

We set up a dedicated email address and telephone line for customers to contact us directly and made sure that these were manned at the weekend to cope with the expected volume of inquiries. </p> <p>A significant number of customers contacted us, and feedback was generally positive that we have been open and proactive about the security breach.</p> <p>Through <a href=\"http://www.guardianholidayoffers.co.uk/home\">Guardian Holidays</a>, the department actively promotes train travel in the UK and Europe and invites readers to participate in the <a href=\"http://www.guardianhomeexchange.co.uk/\">Guardian Home Exchange</a>, which encourages low-cost holidays. We are also launching a boutique hotels site this summer to provide accommodation-only options for Guardian customers who do not wish to join an escorted tour. This will have a high UK inventory too \u2013 promoting the staycation.</p> <p>Guardian Holidays have also developed a <a href=\"http://www.guardiancottages.co.uk/sites/cottageselection/partners/gdn/pages//popups/GHOSustainablePolicy.pdf\">Sustainability policy</a>, which we will circulate to our travel partners soon and feature on the site for customers to see how we aim to work. This policy was developed based on an assessment of the sustainability risk of our offers and services to identify the priorities for the policy. </p> <p>The process looked at the scale of the risk, the opportunity for improvement, and the influence or control GNM had over the risk. As a result the policy will focus on: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Social justice</strong> Respect for the rights of all individuals, protection of human rights and fair labour practices.</li> <li><strong>The environment</strong> Respect and care for the environment to support human health, resources and the climate.</li> <li><strong>Economic equity</strong> Ensure financial stability of partners, provide fair opportunities for small and local suppliers, and removal of corruption in all its forms.</li> <li><strong>Passenger welfare</strong> Understanding the diverse needs, well-being and ensure the security and safety of our travellers.</li> </ul> <p>The publishing partner for <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/home.do?gclid=CJ_i7f3mlrECFUdvfAodLn2zeg\">Guardian Books</a>' print business is Random House, the first consumer publishing group in the world to be awarded FSC chain-of-custody accreditation. They work with their paper mills to ensure that all black and white demy, royal, A format and B format titles are produced on FSC paper. </p> <p>Random House also has a full paper procurement policy that looks to guarantee responsible use of natural resources in the production and distribution of books, the efficient use of energy, water, raw materials and space, the reduction of waste, the recycling of packaging, and the prevention of pollution. </p> <p>In August 2011, Guardian Books launched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/info/series/guardian-shorts\">Guardian Shorts</a>, an ebook-only publishing programme. Digital publishing arguably reduces the environmental impact and waste associated with traditional publishing, as there is no risk of overprinting (which leads to paper wastage). </p> <p>The Guardian Shorts list also features a range of titles highlighting environmental concerns and promoting more sustainable ways of life, including guides to walking and cycling in the UK, an urban wildlife spotting handbook, an exploration of the commercial opportunities and threats presented by the exploitation of Arctic natural resources, and a book about M-PESA, a company that provides mobile money services to more than 16 million Kenyans, sparking entrepreneurship and new business formation.&#xa0; </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mobile/streetstories\">Streetstories</a></h2> <p>In April 2012, Guardian News &amp; Media's business development and multimedia teams launched Streetstories, a prototype app for iPhone and Android, which triggered audio clips relevant to the users' location, using GPS. </p> <p>It was launched to test whether there was consumer interest in apps that created immersive storytelling experiences in specific locations. </p> <p>Streetstories worked in King's Cross, London \u2013 GNM's neighbourhood \u2013 and users could explore 70 stories with over two hours of audio. With subjects ranging from Charles Dickens's childhood to the 90s clubbing scene, the team recorded audio clips with artists, musicians, historians, architects and residents.&#xa0;</p> <p>The app attracted significant media interest, and the local community's help and support to create high quality content was key to this. Lead producer Shehani Fernando threw herself into the project and spoke to everyone from community members trying to regenerate sections of the canal to the children and pensioners of the Somers Town estate. </p> <p>She climbed the tower of St Pancras hotel to talk to Harry Handelsman, a permanent resident there, and revisited the <a href=\"http://camden.gov.uk/ccm/content/leisure/local-history/kings-cross-voices.en;jsessionid=776BA9A025B59AB51A27CE2B5174A08D\">King's Cross Voices project</a>, which Camden council ran a few years ago, trawling through their audio archive and transcripts, as well as working with oral historian Alan Dein.</p> <p>It was a wonderful experience that really grounded the app launch team in the King's Cross area, as well as introducing them to new neighbours.&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.prixpictet.com/\" title=\"\">Prix Pictet</a> is possibly the world's greatest photography prize. In just four years it has become like an Oscar or Nobel prize for stills photographers. It is backed by a private bank, so the cheque for 100,000 Swiss Francs prize is unlikely to bounce.</p> <p>The competition is only open to people nominated by others, attracts the very best entries and the pictures chosen by the judges travel the world for a year in a major exhibition. (Don't think about buying them, though: Pictet has helped elevate pictures of the environment into mainstream \"art\", but a set of any of this year's shortlisted photographers will set you back \u00a310,000 or more.)</p> <p>After water, earth and growth over the last few years, this year's theme was power, and earlier this month the 12 shortlisted photographers showcased some of their work at the Saatchi gallery in Chelsea. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/09/luc-delahaye-wins-2012-prix-pictet-award\" title=\"\">main prize was won by Luc Delahaye</a> for a selection of pictures covering the tsunami, Dubai, the World Economic Forum and Opec. It is a brilliant body of work compiled over eight years around the institutions that pull the levers of power and the victims of war and natural disaster.</p> <p>But of the 11 other shortlisted photographers, six submitted pictures of physical environments that have been bruised or violently damaged by industrial power. They included pictures from the 2010 Gulf oil spill, the aftermaths of Chernobyl and Fukushima and destruction of forests.</p> <p>In the words of Stephen Barber, group managing director of the bank Pictet &amp; Cie and founder of the prize:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Here is art with purpose, art with power to penetrate every sphere of human activity, art with the energy to open the most jaded eye to the catastrophe that creeps upon us or art to document the sleepwalk to cataclysm.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Together, the pictures illustrate the war - there is no other word - being waged by global industry on the environment.</p> <p>Daniel Beltra's pictures of the BP oil spill, first commissioned by Greenpeace, show abstract beauty and seductive horror side-by-side in the Gulf of Mexico. His images of a coral green, oil-stained sea, ablaze with the violent colours of dispersants, illustrate the tiny scale of the clean-up and the gorgeousness of the water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398275977\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/10/19/1350665671215/Prix-Pictet-2012--Daniel--008.jpg\" alt=\"Prix Pictet 2012 : Daniel Beltra\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil Spill #1 by Daniel Beltra.

But reading between the lines, this may be the last Pictet to focus on the damage that man has done. In an afterword in the accompanying book, Barber makes the case for expanding the \"mission\" of the award to embrace not just \"environment\" but \"more general questions of sustainability\".</p> <p>This could prove a dangerous road because \"sustainability\" can mean all things to all people. The judges of the Pictet and its advisory board - largely investment managers, business journalists, bank employees and art collectors including Leo Johnson, the brother of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers partner - come largely from that section of the international art and business establishment that has paid little attention so far to climate change or the great environment issues of our time, and who just might welcome a change from these uncomfortable images.</p> <p>Five years ago, writes Barber, \"with the world economy expanding with abandon and easy money in abundant supply, environmental activism seemed not only affordable, but a convenient expiation for our sins of overconsumption. But as the financial crisis took hold, the pieties of the environment lobby came to be seen as extravagant scaremongering\".</p> <p>Well, that may be true in the charmed European, American and British financial corridors of power that created the crisis, but Pictet's directors should need no reminding that the war goes on and those on the frontline would certainly not agree.</p>",
  "<p>The development of online professional networks is an excellent example of how Guardian News &amp; Media can make money and do good.</p> <p>There are now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">15 professional networks</a>, covering many areas that are core to social and environmental justice, such as the social enterprise, social care, local government, education and sustainable business.</p> <p>They provide insight, analysis, best-practice knowledge, jobs, training and career advice to their professional community, based on our open journalism philosophy.</p> <p>The networks achieve this in various ways including news updates, blogs from our community members, comment pieces from our expert panels, interviews with sector leader, live Q&amp;As and debates, conferences, roundtables and networking events. </p> <p>The networks also promote jobs relevant to that industry, allowing the networks to become a one-stop shop for business professionals. </p> <p>Our communities are engaged through our own platform and numerous social media sites. We have more than 100,000 engaged Twitter followers and many more users on Facebook and LinkedIn.</p> <p>Each network also condenses information on a specific topic, relevant to that industry through the use of content hubs, which are sponsored. There are now 30 commercial relationships with external partners.</p> <p>New networks launched in the past year have included the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\">Guardian Media</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network\">Culture</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network\">Guardian Students</a>. Other networks cover a range of topics, including public leaders, volunteering and healthcare.&#xa0;</p> <p>The success of the professional networks has seen membership subscription more than quadruple in the past 12 months to almost 170,000 members. </p> <p>Members receive weekly newsletters as well as discounts to events and seminars and an ability to contribute to the ongoing development of the networks through participating in quarterly surveys, and specialist content and careers advice.</p> <p>Surveys across the networks are a new initiative that has already seen outstanding results. Twenty two surveys conducted so far have included questions on topical issues such as the London riots and the Health and Social Care Act, as well questions regarding jobs and events \u2013 all enabling members to tell us what they would like to see more of on the networks as they move forward.</p> <p>Each month, the professional networks have more than 2 million page views and more than 1 million unique visitors. They have also been developing a strong international membership and supported a number of large international events this year, with various teams visiting Brazil, New York and Europe.&#xa0;</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business\">Guardian Sustainable Business</a></h2> <p>Guardian Sustainable Business (GSB), one of the professional networks, is striving to be the world's leading platform for progressive business to engage with the sustainability agenda.</p> <p>We recognise that the Guardian platform gives us unique means to explore the complexities of the role that business plays in society.</p> <p>The website seeks to walk the tightrope of showing where good practice exists and showcasing leading-edge thinking, while constantly challenging business to be more courageous in creating change.</p> <p>Key to our growth is the community we build and interact with GSB now has more than 10,000 members and regularly sees 120,000 monthly unique users, up from 50,000 at the beginning of the year. </p> <p>The GSB sponsorship team has focused on commercial partnerships that build integrity and trust with both our commercial customers and audiences. They actively approach companies that have the best reputations for leadership and pioneering change, as opposed to organisations that have committed substantial budgets for greenwashing or superficial public relations campaigning. </p> <p>These commercial partnerships range from editorial partnerships, conferences and awards to webinars, supplements and podcasts.</p> <p>This has allowed us to build a community of progressive sponsors and advertisers who have in turn attracted other like-minded businesses to work with us. Our readers have also responded positively, engaging regularly with sponsor-generated content and live debates. </p> <p>An example of the collaborations we have forged is the partnership with Unilever, which is a leader in the field of sustainability. </p> <p>Our brief was to develop content around the issue of sustainable lifestyles and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/unilever-five-levers-for-change\">levers that affect behaviour change</a>. One aspect of this project was an event that we live broadcast to 55 countries, pulling in business leaders and global sustainability experts from around the world. This was followed by a crowd-sourcing initiative to develop ideas to encourage consumers to take shorter showers and save water and energy. </p> <p>Alongside our online content we have developed several mechanisms for professional development, such as quarterly free conferences and seminars. We also organise annual awards to help drive the agenda by inspiring companies to act.</p>",
  "<p>This week we've seen a geek-baiting bit of US drama cross-referencing on Sky1. In Monday's opening episode of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/oct/23/arrow-hit-the-target\" title=\"\">absurd archery-based action drama Arrow</a>, our hero had spent five years shipwrecked on a remote island. When he returned home, his best friend filled him in: \"OK, what did you miss? Super Bowl winners: Giants, Steelers, Saints, Packers, Giants again. We've got a black president, that's new. Oh and Lost? They were all dead. Um \u2026 I think.\"</p> <p>Meta knowingness aside, it's an indication of the disappointment that greeted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/may/24/lost-ending-final-episode-reviewed\" title=\"\">the denouement of JJ Abrams's plane-crash saga</a> that it has since become a byword for short-changing viewers. Let's hope Lost's sister drama and Abrams's creation, Fringe, doesn't fall victim to the same fate. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qC9mdKS44ZM\" title=\"\">fifth and final series</a> starts tonight \u2013 also on Sky1, neatly \u2013 and fans are salivating at the prospect of its mysteries being solved.</p> <p>The cult show follows the FBI's Fringe Division: high-flying agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), former con artist Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson, who has gone all wise-looking since <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEUH3uIyXxw\" title=\"\">his Dawson's Creek days</a>), and Peter's father Walter (the craggy and incredible John Noble), a mad scientist who steals most of his scenes. This endearingly motley trio use \"fringe science\" \u2013 state-of-the-art biotechnology, psychotropic drugs and old-fashioned procedural detective work \u2013 to investigate unexplained events, usually grisly deaths.</p> <p>Over four seasons, Fringe has gradually shifted away from \"monster of the week\" cases to explore over-arching themes and its own mythology. It turned out to be Walter's Timothy Leary-ish experiments back in the 60s that created many of these supernatural phenomena in the first place. Olivia realised she was one of his guinea pigs and as a result, possesses otherwordly powers. Peter was revealed to be not Peter at all. But still sort of Peter. It's a long story involving parallel universes and wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey stuff. </p> <p>We return, in an episode brilliantly titled \"Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11\" (sounds like an album track by the Fall), to find Team Fringe in the year 2036, a dystopian future where \"The Observers\" \u2013 bald, besuited, superpowered figures who have benignly watched over the series from the start \u2013 have gone bad, wiped out much of humanity, enslaved the rest and begun modifying Earth's environment to suit their own purposes. Fringe Division discovered this plan in 2015 and froze themselves in amber to save the future world. Rescued from suspended animation by Henrietta \u2013 Peter and Olivia's daughter, last seen as a toddler but now a renegade Fringe agent and key member of the human resistance movement \u2013 the Fringe family are the planet's last hope. Still with me? I'm impressed.</p> <p>In fact it sounds more complicated than it is. At its heart, Fringe is about good versus evil and emotional relationships: Peter and Olivia's romance, Walter's father-son bond with Peter and now a third generation in the form of Henrietta (who looks unnervingly like Fearne Cotton). It's classy, inventive sci-fi with shades of Doctor Who, Looper, The Matrix and The X Files. Now there are a mere 13 instalments left, bringing it to a nice, round 100 episodes.</p> <p>Unlike Lost, which had a haphazard narrative and didn't know its own duration until three series in, Fringe was always planned to last five seasons. Having learned his lesson on both Alias and Lost, Abrams insisted on drafting out all the long-running plot lines, including the finale, prior to production of the first series, so the writers have known all along where they are going. Hopefully the characters aren't all dead and in limbo. Again.</p> <p>So have you stuck with Fringe since the start or will you be tuning into the climax out of curiosity? And what are your hopes for the big finish? Let us know below \u2013 and please, no spoilers if you've already seen episodes from the new season.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II - Update III)</strong></p> <p>A primary reason for opposing the acquisition of abusive powers and civil liberties erosions is that they virtually always become permanent, vested not only in current leaders one may love and trust but also future officials who seem more menacing and less benign. </p> <p>The Washington Post has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html\">crucial and disturbing story</a> this morning by Greg Miller about the concerted efforts by the Obama administration to fully institutionalize \u2013 to make officially permanent \u2013 the most extremist powers it has exercised in the name of the war on terror. </p> <p>Based on interviews with \"current and former officials from the White House and the Pentagon, as well as intelligence and counterterrorism agencies\", Miller reports that as \"the United States' conventional wars are winding down\", the Obama administration \"expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years\" (the \"capture\" part of that list is little more than symbolic, as the US focus is <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/14/chomsky_on_obama/\">overwhelmingly on the \"kill\" part</a>). Specifically, \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade.\" As Miller puts it: \"That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.\"</p> <p>In pursuit of this goal, \"White House counterterrorism adviser John O Brennan is seeking to codify the administration's approach to generating capture/kill lists, part of a broader effort to guide future administrations through the counterterrorism processes that Obama has embraced.\" All of this, writes Miller, demonstrates \"the extent to which Obama has institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent war.\" </p> <p>The Post article cites numerous recent developments reflecting this Obama effort, including the fact that \"CIA Director David H Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of the agency's fleet of armed drones\", which \"reflects the agency's transformation into a paramilitary force, and makes clear that it does not intend to dismantle its drone program and return to its pre-September 11 focus on gathering intelligence.\" The article also describes rapid expansion of commando operations by the US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and, perhaps most disturbingly, the creation of a permanent bureaucratic infrastructure to allow the president to assassinate at will:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"JSOC also has established a secret targeting center across the Potomac River from Washington, current and former U.S. officials said. The elite command's targeting cells have traditionally been located near the front lines of its missions, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. But JSOC created a 'national capital region' task force that is a 15-minute commute from the White House so it could be more directly involved in deliberations about al-Qaeda lists.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The creepiest aspect of this development is the christening of a new Orwellian euphemism for due-process-free presidential assassinations: \"disposition matrix\". Writes Miller:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Over the past two years, the Obama administration has been secretly developing a new blueprint for pursuing terrorists, a next-generation targeting list called the 'disposition matrix'.</p> <p>\"The matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine operations. US officials said the database is designed to go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the 'disposition' of suspects beyond the reach of American drones.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The \"disposition matrix\" has been developed and will be overseen by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). One of its purposes is \"to augment\" the \"separate but overlapping kill lists\" maintained by the CIA and the Pentagon: to serve, in other words, as the centralized clearinghouse for determining who will be executed without due process based upon how one fits into the executive branch's \"matrix\". As Miller describes it, it is \"a single, continually evolving database\" which includes \"biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations\" as well as \"strategies for taking targets down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrols\". This analytical system that determines people's \"disposition\" will undoubtedly be kept completely secret; Marcy Wheeler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/260906328980086786\">sardonically said</a> that she was \"looking forward to the government's arguments explaining why it won't release the disposition matrix to ACLU under FOIA\".</p> <p>This was all motivated by Obama's refusal to arrest or detain terrorist suspects, and his resulting commitment simply to killing them at will (his will). Miller quotes \"a former US counterterrorism official involved in developing the matrix\" as explaining the impetus behind the program this way: \"We had a disposition problem.\"</p> <p>The central role played by the NCTC in determining who should be killed \u2013 \"It is the keeper of the criteria,\" says one official to the Post \u2013 is, by itself, rather odious. As Kade Crockford of the ACLU of Massachusetts <a href=\"http://privacysos.org/node/857\">noted in response to this story</a>, the ACLU <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/biggest-new-spying-program-youve-probably-never-heard\">has long warned</a> that the real purpose of the NCTC \u2013 despite its nominal focus on terrorism - is the \"massive, secretive data collection and mining of trillions of points of data about most people in the United States\". </p> <p>In particular, the NCTC operates a gigantic data-mining operation, in which all sorts of information about innocent Americans is systematically monitored, stored, and analyzed. This includes \"records from law enforcement investigations, health information, employment history, travel and student records\" \u2013 \"literally anything the government collects would be fair game\". In other words, the NCTC - now vested with the power to determine the proper \"disposition\" of terrorist suspects - is the same agency that is at the center of the ubiquitous, unaccountable surveillance state aimed at American citizens.</p> <p>Worse still, as the ACLU's legislative counsel Chris Calabrese documented back in July <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/biggest-new-spying-program-youve-probably-never-heard\">in a must-read analysis</a>, Obama officials very recently abolished safeguards on how this information can be used. Whereas the agency, during the Bush years, was barred from storing non-terrorist-related information about innocent Americans for more than 180 days \u2013 a limit which \"meant that NCTC was dissuaded from collecting large databases filled with information on innocent Americans\" \u2013 it is now free to do so. Obama officials eliminated this constraint by authorizing the NCTC \"to collect and 'continually assess' information on innocent Americans for up to five years\". </p> <p>And, as usual, this agency engages in these incredibly powerful and invasive processes with virtually no democratic accountability:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"All of this is happening with very little oversight. Controls over the NCTC are mostly internal to the DNI's office, and important oversight bodies such as Congress and the President's Intelligence Oversight Board aren't notified even of 'significant' failures to comply with the Guidelines. Fundamental legal protections are being sidestepped. For example, under the new guidelines, Privacy Act notices (legal requirements to describe how databases are used) must be completed by the agency that collected the information. This is in spite of the fact that those agencies have no idea what NCTC is actually doing with the information once it collects it.</p> <p>\"All of this amounts to a reboot of the Total Information Awareness Program that Americans rejected so vigorously right after 9/11.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It doesn't require any conspiracy theorizing to see what's happening here. Indeed, it takes extreme naivet\u00e9, or wilful blindness, not to see it.</p> <p>What has been created here - permanently institutionalized - is a highly secretive executive branch agency that simultaneously engages in two functions: (1) it collects and analyzes massive amounts of surveillance data about all Americans without any judicial review let alone search warrants, and (2) creates and implements a \"matrix\" that determines the \"disposition\" of suspects, up to and including execution, without a whiff of due process or oversight. It is simultaneously a surveillance state and a secretive, unaccountable judicial body that analyzes who you are and then decrees what should be done with you, how you should be \"disposed\" of, beyond the reach of any minimal accountability or transparency. </p> <p>The Post's Miller recognizes the watershed moment this represents: \"The creation of the matrix and the institutionalization of kill/capture lists reflect a shift that is as psychological as it is strategic.\" As he explains, extra-judicial assassination was once deemed so extremist that very extensive deliberations were required before Bill Clinton could target even Osama bin Laden for death by lobbing cruise missiles in East Africa. But:</p> <blockquote> <p>Targeted killing is now so routine that the Obama administration has spent much of the past year codifying and streamlining the processes that sustain it.</p> </blockquote> <p>To understand the Obama legacy, please re-read that sentence. As Murtaza Hussain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MazMHussain/status/260898386000089091\">put it</a> when reacting to the Post story: \"The US agonized over the targeted killing Bin Laden at Tarnak Farms in 1998; now it kills people it barely suspects of anything on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>The pragmatic inanity of the mentality driving this is self-evident: as I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/klein-drones-morning-joe\">discussed yesterday</a> (and many other times), continuous killing does not eliminate violence aimed at the US but rather guarantees its permanent expansion. As a result, wrote Miller, \"officials said no clear end is in sight\" when it comes to the war against \"terrorists\" because, said one official, \"we can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us\" but trying is \"a necessary part of what we do\". Of course, the more the US kills and kills and kills, the more people there are who \"want to harm us\". That's the logic that has resulted in a permanent war on terror.</p> <p>But even more significant is the truly radical vision of government in which this is all grounded. The core guarantee of western justice since the Magna Carta was codified in the US by the <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am5.html\">fifth amendment to the constitution</a>: \"No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" You simply cannot have a free society, a worthwhile political system, without that guarantee, that constraint on the ultimate abusive state power, being honored.</p> <p>And yet what the Post is describing, what we have had for years, is a system of government that \u2013 without hyperbole \u2013 is the very antithesis of that liberty. It is literally impossible to imagine a more violent repudiation of the basic blueprint of the republic than the development of a secretive, totally unaccountable executive branch agency that simultaneously collects information about all citizens and then applies a \"disposition matrix\" to determine what punishment should be meted out. This is classic political dystopia brought to reality (despite how compelled such a conclusion is by these indisputable facts, many Americans will view such a claim as an exaggeration, paranoia, or worse because of <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/believing-oppression-only-happens.html\">this psychological dynamic I described here</a> which leads many good passive westerners to believe that true oppression, by definition, is something that happens only elsewhere).</p> <p>In response to the Post story, Chris Hayes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/260908192643575810\">asked</a>: \"If you have a 'kill list', but the list keeps growing, are you succeeding?\" The answer all depends upon what the objective is.</p> <p>As the Founders all recognized, nothing vests elites with power \u2013 and profit \u2013 more than a state of war. That is why there were supposed to be substantial barriers to having them start and continue - the need for a Congressional declaration, the <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html\">constitutional bar</a> on funding the military for more than two years at a time, the prohibition on standing armies, etc. Here is how John Jay <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed04.asp\">put it in Federalist No 4</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In sum, there are factions in many governments that crave a state of endless war because that is when power is least constrained and profit most abundant. What the Post is reporting is yet another significant step toward that state, and it is undoubtedly driven, at least on the part of some, by a self-interested desire to ensure the continuation of endless war and the powers and benefits it vests. So to answer Hayes' question: the endless expansion of a kill list and the unaccountable, always-expanding powers needed to implement it does indeed represent a great success for many. Read what John Jay wrote in the above passage to see why that is, and why few, if any, political developments should be regarded as more pernicious.</p> <h2>Detention policies</h2> <p>Assuming the Post's estimates are correct \u2013 that \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade\" \u2013 this means that the war on terror will last for more than 20 years, far longer than any other American war. This is what has always made the rationale for indefinite detention \u2013 that it is permissible to detain people without due process until the \"end of hostilities\" \u2013 so warped in this context. Those who are advocating that are endorsing nothing less than life imprisonment - permanent incarceration \u2013 without any charges or opportunities to contest the accusations.</p> <p>That people are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/guantanamo-prisoner-death-democrats\">now dying at Guantanamo</a> after almost a decade in a cage with no charges highlights just how repressive that power is. Extend that mentality to secret, due-process-free assassinations \u2013 something the US government clearly intends to convert into a permanent fixture of American political life \u2013 and it is not difficult to see just how truly extremist and anti-democratic \"war on terror\" proponents in both political parties have become.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>As I noted yesterday, Afghan officials <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-afghanistan-taliban-idUSBRE89M0N120121023\">reported that</a> three Afghan children were killed on Saturday by NATO operations. Today, <a href=\"http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/24/3-killed-kids-hurt-as-fury-grows-over-u-s-drone-strikes-in-pakistan/\">reports CNN</a>, \"missiles blew up part of a compound Wednesday in northwest Pakistan, killing three people - including one woman\" and added: \"the latest suspected U.S. drone strike also injured two children.\" Meanwhile, former Obama press secretary and current campaign adviser Robert Gibbs <a href=\"http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2012/10/23/obama-adviser-robert-gibbs-blames-denver-teens-terrorist-father-for-his-drone-death/\">this week justified</a> the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-airstrike-that-killed-american-teen-in-yemen-raises-legal-ethical-questions/2011/10/20/gIQAdvUY7L_story.html\">US killing of 16-year-old American Abdulrahaman Awlaki</a>, killed by a US drone in Yemen two weeks after his father was, on the ground that he \"should have a far more responsible father\".</p> <p>Also yesterday, <a href=\"http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/23/al-qaeda-figure-comes-back-to-life-in-yemen/\">CNN profiled</a> Abu Sufyan Said al-Shihri, alleged to be a top al-Qaida official in Yemen. He pointed out \"that U.S. drone strikes are helping al-Qaida in Yemen because of the number of civilian deaths they cause.\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-yemen-us-airstrikes-breed-anger-and-sympathy-for-al-qaeda/2012/05/29/gJQAUmKI0U_story.html\">Ample evidence</a> supports his observation.</p> <p>To summarize all this: the US does not interfere in the Muslim world and maintain an endless war on terror because of the terrorist threat. It has a terrorist threat because of its interference in the Muslim world and its endless war on terror.</p> <h2>UPDATE II</h2> <p>The Council on Foreign Relations' Micah Zenko, writing today about the Post article, <a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2012/10/24/institutionalizing-americas-targeted-killing-program/\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Recently, I spoke to a military official with extensive and wide-ranging experience in the special operations world, and who has had direct exposure to the targeted killing program. To emphasize how easy targeted killings by special operations forces or drones has become, this official flicked his hand back over and over, stating: 'It really is like swatting flies. We can do it forever easily and you feel nothing. But how often do you really think about killing a fly?'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is disturbingly consistent with <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-rise-of-the-killer-drones-how-america-goes-to-war-in-secret-20120416?print=true\">prior reports</a> that the military's term for drone victims is \"bug splat\". This - this warped power and the accompanying dehumanizing mindset - is what is being institutionalized as a permanent fixture in American political life by the current president.</p> <h2>UPDATE III</h2> <p>At Wired, Spencer Ackerman reacts to the Post article with <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/disposition-matrix/\">an analysis</a> entitled \"President Romney Can Thank Obama for His Permanent Robotic Death List\". Here is his concluding paragraph:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Obama did not run for president to preside over the codification of a global war fought in secret. But that's his legacy. . . . Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign Relations writes that Obama's predecessors in the Bush administration 'were actually much more conscious and thoughtful about the long-term implications of targeted killings', because they feared the political consequences that might come when the U.S. embraces something at least superficially similar to assassination. Whoever follows Obama in the Oval Office can thank him for proving those consequences don't meaningfully exist \u2014 as he or she reviews the backlog of names on the Disposition Matrix.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's worth devoting a moment to letting that sink in.</p>",

  "<p>Joining a graduate scheme is a great way to begin your accountancy career \u2013 the start of a journey that will offer endless experiences with a professional services firm.</p> <p>To apply for a scheme, a student must have work experience although technical skills are not usually expected at this stage. Applicants with a range of skills and attributes, including commercial awareness, and planning and relationship building, are also welcome as these can be successfully transferred to a graduate scheme.</p> <p>The key to gaining this experience is to think about it during the early years of your university career, using your vacations productively and being open to different learning experiences. There are a variety of ways to develop these skills, from part-time work during studies, such as working in a shop, volunteering and charity work, or doing a work placement during holidays. If you have identified accounting as your chosen career in advance, applying for a placement in your first or second year is a good idea as this gives you as much experience as possible.</p> <p>The application process for accounting graduate schemes can be lengthy and competitive. For example, at Deloite the successful graduate will need to complete an online test and face-to-face interview, as well as assessment centres. But remember that your degree studies are ideal preparation for the workplace. The self-discipline required for study, an enthusiasm to learn, problem-solving skills, giving presentations, group work, written and verbal communication and analytical skills are all used to a greater or lesser extent while studying for a degree. All of these skills are transferable and will be used from the very beginning of a career with any professional services firm.</p> <p>One of our new graduates summed up this comparison very well recently, saying: \"I studied English at university and was worried that I had minimal experience in a commercial environment ... after a month it dawned on me that Deloitte provides all the technical training we require for the job, I just need to apply the skills I learnt at university within this environment.\"</p> <p>If successful it can be helpful for new recruits to talk to those already working in the firm. Some companies do this formally, for example, graduates are assigned a 'buddy' who works at Deloitte. The buddy is able to answer any questions the graduate did not want, or may have forgotten, to ask during the interview stages. It's important for new recruits to feel comfortable by the time they reach their first day so they are able to hit the ground running. The buddy also guides our graduates through any preparation work they should be aware of before they join the firm so keep your eye out for this too.</p> <p>Accountancy graduate schemes are stepping stones between university and employment and every day will be different. The first few years with the firm will still involve a lot of studying in between working on client projects. These can range from working with a FTSE-listed company to a family business or a public sector organisation. The length of study will depend on which part of the firm you join \u2013 such as tax, audit, corporate finance, consulting or technology.</p> <p>When in the office, graduates can expect to spend their time researching, attending industry events and seminars and doing preparatory work for clients. There are also plenty of opportunities to work on site with the client. Graduates can gain experience pitching for work, taking a brief from clients, interviewing staff for further information or presenting our recommendations.</p> <p>Although the responsibility may seem a little daunting, the opportunities to begin and develop your career in the finance sector is vast and, on established schemes, there is plenty of support to help you on your way.</p> <p><em>Rob Fryer is the graduate recruitment manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/index.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Deloitte</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Waste from mining, lead smelters, industrial dumps and other toxic sites affects the health of an estimated 125 million people in 49 low- and middle-income countries. This unrecognised health burden is on the scale of malaria or tuberculosis (TB), a new report has found.</p> <p>This year's <a href=\"http://www.worstpolluted.org/files/FileUpload/files/2012%20WorstPolluted.pdf\" title=\"\">World's worst pollution problems</a> (pdf) report was published on Tuesday by <a href=\"http://www.blacksmithinstitute.org/\" title=\"\">the Blacksmith Institute</a> in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.greencross.ch/en/home.html\" title=\"\">Green Cross Switzerland</a>. It documents, for the first time, the public health impact of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/oct/24/top-10-toxic-pollution-problems-in-pictures\" title=\"\">industrial pollutants</a> \u2013 lead, mercury, chromium, radionuclides and pesticides \u2013 in the air, water and soil of developing countries.</p> <p>\"This is an extremely conservative estimate,\" said Bret Ericson of the Blacksmith Institute, a small international NGO based in New York City. \"We've investigated 2,600 toxic sites in the last four years, [but] we know there are far more.\"</p> <p>The US has an estimated 100,000-300,000 toxic sites, mainly factories or industrial areas, but toxic sites in the low- and middle-income countries assessed in the report are often in residential areas. \"We see a lot of disease when we go into these communities,\" said Ericson. \"But we were surprised the health burden was so high \u2013 as much as malaria.\"</p> <p>Ericson cited gold mining in the Nigerian state of Zamfara by way of example. In 2010, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res doctors carrying out vaccinations in villages in Zamfara <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=5989\" title=\"\">were shocked to see so few children</a>. The villagers were small-scale gold miners who crushed gold-bearing rocks inside village compounds; the raw ore contained extremely high levels of lead, which had killed hundreds of children and left thousands more with lead poisoning.</p> <p>The health impact of exposure to toxins at the 2,600 sites identified in the report was estimated using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year\" title=\"\">disability adjusted life years</a> (DALYs) metric, which the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other bodies use to measure overall disease burden. The metric is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death, with one DALY equivalent to one lost year of healthy life. The estimate for impact of pollution from toxic sites is 17m DALYs; according to the WHO, malaria's annual toll is 14m DALYs.</p> <p>The human toll of pollution in terms of lost productivity, healthcare cost, lowered life expectancy and social impact is very high. Countries need to wise up to this and realise there are inexpensive ways to avoid toxic pollution, said Ericson.</p> <p>Stephan Robinson, of Green Cross Switzerland, identifies globalisation, and especially mining and resource extraction, as the reason for many toxic sites. The high price of gold has led to increases in both small- and large-scale mining, while lead production rose 10% last year to meet the needs of <a href=\"http://www.worldresourcesforum.org/resource-snapshot-6-lead\" title=\"\">battery and electronics manufacturers</a>. \"Much of this industrial activity is to serve our needs in the developed world,\" said Robinson, who added that toxic sites have received very little attention internationally despite their significant impact on the health of millions of people.</p> <p>According to Green Cross, 4m-10m tonnes of <a href=\"http://www.gcint.org/what-we-do/pollution-reduction-toxic-waste-cleanup/toxic-waste-cleanup-introduction-better-practices\" title=\"\">obsolete but still dangerous pesticides</a> have been abandoned in tens of thousands of locations and must be destroyed. The cost of doing so will range from $3,000-8,000 (\u00a31,900-5,000) a tonne, but attributing responsibility is difficult and it is unclear who will foot the bill, said Robinson. The survey did not include ongoing industrial and large petro-chemical sites.</p> <h2>Top 10 toxic industries in 2012, listed by DALY</h2> <p><strong>1)</strong> Lead-acid battery recycling (4.8m)</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Lead smelting (2.6m)</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Mining and ore processing (2.5m)</p> <p><strong>4) </strong>Tannery operations (1.93m)</p> <p><strong>5)</strong> Industrial/municipal dump sites (1.23m)</p> <p><strong>6)</strong> Industrial estates (1.06m)</p> <p><strong>7)</strong> Artisanal gold mining (1.021m)</p> <p><strong>8)</strong> Product manufacturing (786,000)</p> <p><strong>9)</strong> Chemical manufacturing (765,000)</p> <p><strong>10) </strong>Dye industry (430,000)</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/oct/24/top-10-toxic-pollution-problems-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Top 10 toxic pollution problems \u2013 in pictures</a></p>",

  "<p>Well done, Sir Roger Carr \u2013 president of the CBI and chair of Centrica. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/responsible-capitalism-businesses-reputation\" title=\"\">Writing on this website on 19 October</a>, he laid out the agenda facing corporate boards and C-suites in the UK. \"All businesses,\" he argued, \"are increasingly judged not just on how much money they make, but how they make money; business behaviours and business performance are increasingly inseparable.\"</p> <p>Not that you'd guess it from the behaviours of some leading companies. \"In the last 12 months,\" Sir Roger noted, \"malpractice in the media and the disreputable activities of the banks, have continued to poison the general public's view of business \u2013 and particularly big business.\"</p> <p>His welcome conclusion: \"Bad behaviour must be stamped out by self discipline in our boardrooms, not only to avoid the onerous burden of further red tape and damaging taxation through government intervention, but also so that we can attract diverse, talented people into our organisations.\"</p> <p>All this resonated powerfully because we are working on the next phase of our evolving <a href=\"http://www.breakthroughcapitalism.com/\" title=\"\">Breakthrough Capitalism programme</a> \u2013 which aims to pin down what we should be asking not only of UK boards and C-suites but also of their international counterparts in what we dub the Global C-suite.</p> <p>The nature and scale of that task was brought home recently when Bloomberg carried a blog <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-11/top-1-000-companies-wield-power-reserved-for-nations.html\" title=\"\">by Bob Eccles, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, and George Serafeim</a>, assistant professor of business administration at HBS.</p> <p>Their conclusion: \"Globalisation has concentrated economic power within a group of large companies who are now able to change the world at a scale historically reserved for nations. Just 1,000 businesses are responsible for half of the total market value of the world's more than 60,000 publicly traded companies. They virtually control the global economy. This vast concentration of influence should be the starting point for any strategy of institutional change toward a sustainable society.\"</p> <p>Interestingly, it turns out that there's substantial concentration even within the top 1000. Just 83 companies now account for a third of the Global 1000's $32tn in revenue, Eccles and Serafeim report, while the top 172 companies account for about half of it. The 172nd&#xa0;largest corporation, the Russian oil company Rosneft Oil, had revenue equivalent to the GDP of the 74th&#xa0;largest country, Uruguay.</p> <p>The wider demographic and environmental evidence, meanwhile, suggests that we are headed in unsustainable directions, with the Global C-suite distracted by the downturn and other factors. In this context, Sir Roger's self-discipline and voluntary initiatives can only take us so far. We must change the rules within which capitalism operates \u2013 indeed the very rules of capitalism.</p> <p>True, as Eccles and Serafeim accept, many companies now see they have some responsibility to the world beyond company operations. \"They know that if they are to continue such rapid growth in developing markets \u2013 or, as Willie Sutton might say, 'where the money is' \u2013 they might need to bring in more than goods and services, such as civil-society upgrades where they're most needed: housing, health and education,\" they write. Now that's an idea: multinational corporations helping build civil society institutions that will help keep their own activities in check.</p> <p>All this will require revolutions in our institutions, economics and accounting practices. One of the more interesting blogs was <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-thinking-in-economics-by-andrew-sheng-and-geng-xiao\" title=\"\">posted in October by Andrew Sheng and Xiao Geng of the Fung Global Institute</a>, based in Hong Kong, which highlighted that economics tends to focus on the micro and macro levels, whereas two others levels are of growing concern: the meso and the meta.</p> <p>\"Meso-economics studies the institutional aspects of the economy that are not captured by micro or macroeconomics,\" say Sheng and Geng. \"By presupposing perfect competition, complete information, and zero transaction costs, neoclassical economics assumes away the need for institutions like courts, parties, and religions to deal with the economic problems that people, firms, and countries face.\"</p> <p>And meta-economics? This approach \"goes still further, by studying deeper functional aspects of the economy, understood as a complex, interactive, and holistic living system. It asks questions like why an economy is more competitive and sustainable than others, how and why institutions' governance structures evolve, and how China developed four global-scale supply chains in manufacturing, infrastructure, finance, and government services within such a short period of time.\"</p> <p>The add on our inner Darwin that: \"In order to study the deep hidden principles behind human behaviour, meta-economics requires us to adopt an open-minded, systemic, and evolutionary approach, and to recognise the real economy as a complex living system within other systems. This is difficult, because official statistics mismeasure \u2013 or simply miss \u2013 many of the real economy's hidden rules and practices.\"</p> <p>Clearly, then, we have meso and meta-level challenges that we can't address solely by switching on particular boards and C-suites. Still, converting key elements of the Global C-Suite can be a critical first step. Happily, whatever the intentions may have been, the market trends Eccles and Serafeim explore have already gone a fair way towards making the global economy more adaptable by concentrating market and (potentially) moral leadership into 1,000 boardrooms and/or C-suites.</p> <p>But, as they conclude, ultimately every individual must show responsible behaviour, which can be helped by institutions. So we'll gladly take the best that self-discipline and voluntarism have to offer, Sir Roger, but look forward to hearing how Centrica, the CBI and eventually the Global C-suite plan to embrace the meso and meta dimensions to good effect.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and a non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Should the newest and best drugs we have for treating malaria be stocked in pharmacies and even grocery stores across some of the poorest countries in Africa? That's a question that donors have to decide now, following pilot projects in seven countries and <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/amfm/independentevaluation/\">an evaluation by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</a> (LSHTM).</p> <p>It's an issue that is provoking huge arguments and intense passions, because it is not just about what goes on the shelves of rural drug stores. It is about the belief on one side that the private sector is the most effective way to get medicines to those who need them \u2013 and the certainty on the other side that bolstering the public sector to diagnose and treat people is a fairer and safer way to go. These are not just practical matters, but highly political.</p> <p>The Affordable Medicines Facility\u2013malaria (AMFm) is described by the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which hosts it, as an innovative funding mechanism, which aims to enable countries to increase the provision of affordable artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) through not only the public sector but also the private sector and NGOs. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This will save lives and reduce the use of less-effective treatments to which malaria parasites are becoming increasingly resistant. It will also reduce the use of artemisinin as a single treatment or monotherapy, thereby delaying the onset of resistance to that drug and preserving its effectiveness.</p> </blockquote> <p>ACT prices are heavily subsidised by the AMFm, funded by donors, so that any drug store can afford to stock them. The idea is to flood the market with affordable, high-quality combination treatments, in the hope that families with a sick child will buy ACTs rather than ineffective old drugs for malaria. It also aims to squeeze out the single artemisinin drugs, which ought not to be on the market at all, because using them will lead to resistant strains of malaria developing. The supporters of the scheme point out that people in poor countries buy antimalarials from drug stores all the time, because government-funded health clinics in rural areas are constantly struggling with stock-outs. </p> <p>The independent evaluation of the pilots in Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Zanzibar was very positive. It found that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>AMFm has been a \"game changer\" in the private for-profit sector for all pilots except Niger and Madagascar, with a dramatic impact on the antimalarial market.</p> </blockquote> <p>ACTs had dropped in price, become much more available and increased their market share, said the LSHTM researchers. There was much less impact in the public sector, which continued to be dogged by bureaucratic delays. The limited impact in Madagascar and Niger could have been due to limited mass media campaigns, political, economic or even weather issues and the preponderance of general stores rather than pharmacies to buy the stocks, and, in Niger, itinerant vendors who are not allowed to sell ACTs.</p> <p>But not everyone is impressed. On the eve of a meeting of an expert group that will advise the Global Fund on the future of the scheme, <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/policy/salt-sugar-and-malaria-pills\">Oxfam has launched a scathing attack on it</a>. Far from saving lives, Oxfam says it may put children's lives at risk. Dr Mohga Kamal Yanni, Oxfam's senior health policy adviser, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is dangerous to put the lives of sick children in the hands of a shopkeeper with no medical training and to pursue a scheme that doesn't help those people who need it the most. </p> </blockquote> <p>Many fevers are not malaria, she says, so a child with pneumonia may be given ACTs and die for the want of the antibiotics he or she needs. Shopkeepers will not know the difference. Furthermore, selling medicines excludes the poorest people from treatment \u2013 or forces them to \"economise\" by taking a child out of school or cutting back on food. And those who buy the drugs may well not give their child the full course in order to save some for another occasion, which risks resistance developing.</p> <p>Oxfam is not impressed by the argument that the AMFm is simply replacing the bad antimalarials in the drug stores with good ones. It says the evaluation was limited, because availability of ACTs is not the same as numbers of children treated or lives saved (which are far more difficult to measure). </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.clintonfoundation.org/main/our-work/by-initiative/clinton-health-access-initiative/about.html\">Clinton Health Access Initiative</a>has done some work to try to address the gap, with an analysis of studies looking at the effect of subsidies on the use of ACTs. It found that use \u2013 not just availability \u2013 went up.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Importantly, the observed increases in use occurred among children under five as well as the general population. This finding suggests that ACT price reductions may have substantial impact on populations most at risk of malaria mortality.&#xa0;With as many as 60% of young children in areas with the highest burden of malaria obtaining treatment through private channels, these findings demonstrate that subsidies can significantly increase overall ACT coverage among this vulnerable population.</p> </blockquote> <p>But even this argument is unlikely to win over Oxfam and others that argue the private sector is not the right place to send people for treatment. Most important of all is diagnosis, they say, so children and adults can get the right treatment. Drugs alone are not enough. They want to see trained community health workers, who will meet and chat to women with children with fever, advise them and, if possible, diagnose them and give them drugs \u2013 or refer them to the primary health clinic. Not a public/private partnership \u2013 but a public/public partnership. The cost of the subsidy and support interventions so far has been $517m (\u00a3323m), says Kamal Yanni. That would pay for the training and a year's salary for 390,000 local health workers.</p> <p>Whatever the Global Fund board decides next month, this fundamental clash of views is unlikely to be resolved.</p>",
  "<p>The images from the summer of 2010 were undoubtedly gruesome: the carcass of a young sperm whale, decayed and partially eaten by sharks, sighted at sea south of the Deepwater Horizon oil well.</p> <p>It was the first confirmed sighting of a dead whale since the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2010/jul/08/bp-oil-spill-timeline-interactive\" title=\"\">BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</a> in April that year \u2013 a time of huge public interest in the fate of whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other threatened animals \u2013 and yet US government officials supressed the first reports of the discovery and blocked all images until now.</p> <p>The photographs, along with a cache of emails obtained by the campaign group Greenpeace under freedom of information provisions and made available to the Guardian, offer a rare glimpse into how many whales came into close contact with the gushing BP well during the oil spill.</p> <p>They also show Obama administration officials tightly controlling information about whales and other wildlife caught up in the disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398266518\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/10/23/1351008575615/A-dead-Sperm-Whale-floati-009.jpg\" alt=\"A dead Sperm Whale floating in the Gulf of Mexico seen from the deck of NOAA Ship Pisces\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The dead sperm whale in the Gulf of Mexico.

Twenty-four hours after the sighting he had heard, through the wife of another officer, of a crew member \"posting something on their Facebook page to the effect that they saw a 'dead critter' yesterday but are being censored by NOAA from saying anything else \u2026 followed by a lot of indignant comments from others.\"</p> <p>The attempt to shut out the media also sat uneasily with Greenpeace.</p> <p>NOAA <a href=\"http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100617_whale.html\" title=\"\">did put out a press release about the dead whale</a>. However, the release was edited and shortened in a way which appeared to minimise the effects of oil on whales.</p> <p>\"The public has no idea what the fate of those animals is,\" Davies said.</p> <p>That information may never surface. There were believed to be about 1,200 sperm whale in the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the spill, making it one of the biggest populations in the world.</p> <p>However, scientists concede little is known about how whales respond to oil spills \u2013 even in an area as heavily mined as the Gulf of Mexico. Few whales strand on land, and it is practically impossible to carry out necropsies at sea.</p> <p>\"We do know that oil spills do kill whales but we know very little about how lethal they are and what makes them lethal,\" said Hal Whitehead, cetacean research biologist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. \"The whales that are there or used to be there move around a fair amount so if they weren't actively avoiding the spill there is a good chance that quite a large proportion of them might have gone into it.\"</p> <p>NOAA scientists, working with Oregon State University, have been tracking a number of sperm whale in the Gulf of Mexico through satellite transmitters since the spill. \"There isn't at least anything published that has clear linkages between sperm whale that got covered in oil and died in the same way,\" said Bruce Mates who heads the marine mammal institute at Oregon State.</p> <p>And with the one whale carcass recovered so far, scientists were not able to establish the definitive cause of death.</p> <p>\"Scientists did take samples from the carcass, but because the animal was so badly decomposed the cause of death could not be determined,\" Smullen said.</p> <p>Indeed, Smullen said he was unable even to confirm whether the whale had even been exposed to BP oil, writing: \"Due to ongoing litigation issues, we are not able to discuss this aspect of our investigation.\"</p>",
  "<p>Bengalis, wherever they are, can smell the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/oct/16/india.internationalnews\" title=\"\">Durga Puja</a> in the air at this time of the year. I can every year, but after a decade in the UK, I was looking forward to them more than ever before, because it would be my half-English toddlers' first taste of the magic of the Pujas.</p> <p>\"I'm English,\" my four-year-old son said with total conviction, \"not Indian.\" That's when we decided it was time our half-Indian children learned to love the other, more distant (5,000 miles distant) side of their heritage. Living in Britain from birth, it wasn't surprising that he and his little sister considered themselves English.</p> <p>Their paternal side, a close-knit Yorkshire family, celebrate Christmas and Easter in style. Every Christmas Eve, we travel to their little village outside Doncaster where the family home is done up beautifully and there are several rounds of traditional tipples and goodies to be had before the festivities have even begun. The snack left out for Santa the night before is magically gone when the kids tumble out of bed on Christmas morning. In its place is a mountain of gifts for the kids to dig into. They get everything they wish for, and more. That jolly elderly man in the red suit never gets it wrong. Spring heralds the arrival of the Easter bunny, with his bonanza of chocolate for our kids and their cousins, gathered together at their grandparents. On top of the many sweet treats they receive, there is an exciting egg hunt that yields more chocolate!</p> <p>Is it any wonder the kids love their English festivals? They are completely enchanting. And I, the only non-English member of the clan, am all for it. I grew up in a liberal Indian family that celebrated everything. We were Hindu by descent but \"festival tarts\" in practice. We rarely exchanged gifts (not even for the pujas) and never even dreamt of so much chocolate, but we always did up a little Christmas tree, sang carols and scoffed cake on Christmas Day.</p> <p>I love the beauty and bustle of the principal Bengali festival, the Durga Puja, equally. Come autumn, <a href=\"http://www.calcuttaweb.com/puja/\" title=\"\">Kolkata is transformed</a>. It scrubs up like no other place. The day-to-day constraints of life in this cash-strapped city are forgotten in an effort to put on a fantastic show for its millions. From broken pavements and rutted roads spring the most amazing temporary temples known to man, made from every conceivable (often recycled) material under the blazing Kolkata sun. The clay images of the goddess and her family, made by a community of sublime craftsmen on the banks of the Hooghly, are wonders to behold for their artistry and individuality. Thousands of these \"temples\" and images are created every year, each one like no other; some are stunning, some witty, every one of them worth visiting. And Bengalis from far and wide flock to the marvel that is Kolkata at Puja time. The fabulous, ingenious, shimmering story-telling lights draw massive throngs in the evenings, but the day is no less special, as that's when Kolkatans enjoy a heady mixture of friends, family and the tastiest food on the planet.</p> <p>Our children, my husband and I agree, are very lucky to have more than one wondrous festival to celebrate. A dual heritage like theirs is a privilege that gives them access to so many marvels. Not just festivals, but the wealth of art, culture, literature and history that India and Britain have to offer. We want them to enjoy every last bit of it. Young as they are, they have shown a penchant for embracing the new: whether it's snacking on snails in France or deftly picking up the footwork of a foreign dance. Despite that, it was clear we had to do more to help them connect with their Indian roots. It was time for them to discover Durga.</p> <p>Fully aware what a hard act the Kolkata pujas are for an expatriate community to follow, I still wanted to take our toddlers to the nearest British puja for their rendezvous with Durga. Kolkatans wait all year to spend millions of their hard-earned cash on the festivities. A large London do might stretch to \u00a340,000, but would a modest Midlands puja be able to mount an extravaganza to dazzle the kids? Brought up on the larger-than-life celebrations of the British Isles, the numbers were against us. Britons spend an average of \u00a3600 on Christmas every year, and we're no different. In fact, the UK spent \u00a31.2bn over the Easter period last year. Even if budget permitted, UK health and safety laws wouldn't allow an English puja to stage a light-and-sound spectacular to equal Kolkata.</p> <p>But we had a plan to make Durga as attractive as possible to our offspring. Besides the twinkling bangles and bindis and sumptuous outfits to tempt them, we had also cooked up the legend of the \"puja fairy\". Watching over them from her perch on the bookshelf, she would reward their enthusiasm with gifts of a book each (just the one, we weren't duplicating Christmas) to remember her by, the rest of the year. The innovation was not dissimilar to our unexpectedly successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2011/oct/26/diwali-festival-of-lights#/?picture=381002202&amp;index=0\" title=\"\">Diwali </a>celebrations last year, where alongside the traditional clay lamps and sparklers, we introduced toasted marshmallows and sky lanterns, to the delight of not only our children but their friends as well.</p> <p>As it turned out, we didn't need the embellishments.</p> <p>It may have been frosty outside the Leicester temple when we arrived, but the warm welcome we got inside more than made up for it. Smiling like old friends, they sat us down and chatted. When the toddlers grew peckish before dinner time, they happily served them early. The delight on our children's faces when the music started was confirmation our children were learning to love their Indian side. They sang and danced with every number, piped up about the \"pretty princesses\" on stage at inappropriate times, and were showered with indulgent smiles and praise in return. They had so enjoyed the delicious, vegetarian meal they had earlier, they nearly ate all of ours as well.</p> <p>Agreeing to leave at the end of the evening only after a promise had been extracted from us to return next year, the children presented the most heart-warming picture when they put their palms together in a traditional goodbye. That is, until my son bellowed: \"Adios amigos!\"</p> <p>Clearly, there was work to be done before they were completely at home in their half-Indian skin, but for now, Durga had won them over, and that was enough.</p>",

That is why we are finding ways to monetise the Guardian's unique space to facilitate debate and an exchange of ideas.</p> <p>One example is the development of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business\">Guardian Sustainable Business</a> (GSB) website, which aims to support the engagement of business in seeking solutions to the multiple challenges of climate change, resource depletion, ecosystem degradation and social inequality.</p> <p>GSB was specifically created for the dual purpose of making money and providing high-quality editorial content to sustainability professionals and others who are interested in the role of business in society.</p> <p>Another innovation from GNM is the Select advertising model, which works by bringing together the best independent publishers and blogs from across the web and helping them monetise their sites by running premium advertising campaigns across them. The benefit to GNM is access to excellent content sites and extended reach to a quality audience above and beyond theguardian.com users.</p> <p>The Guardian carries out an annual survey of paper readers and web users as part of the Living our Values audit. This includes questions on whether they think we should refuse to accept advertising from certain types of companies. </p> <p>The 2012 result shows a smaller proportion of print readers than in past years, Guardian 12% and Observer 12%, who would not object to any specific forms of advertising. For theguardian.com visitors, this was 20%, down from 28%, in 2011. </p> <p>The type of advertising that most Guardian and Observer readers and users would like to see omitted from the paper is for financial institutions involved in unethical investment, tax avoidance and mis-selling. Nearly three-quarters of readers from both titles objected. Online users also objected most to this type of advertising, although at 63% it was slightly lower than their print reading counterparts.</p> <p>High levels of concern were also directed at companies who maintain highly damaging environmental practices and fashion brands with unethical labour practices. In many cases, the opposition to this type of advertising was in the seventy percentile and higher. </p> <p>These concerns do appear to align with the sense of injustice that many in society are feeling currently and the very public anger at the banks. </p> <p>At the same time, there is a realisation that advertising is essential to the financial sustainability of the Guardian, with only 13% of Guardian readers saying they were willing to pay more for an advertising-free experience. </p> <p>However, 41% said that they would be prepared to register and log-in to Guardian digital services if a proportion of advertising revenues went to charity or community partnership projects.</p> <p>The Guardian's commercial departments follow advertising industry guidelines and also on occasion refuse to carry advertisements or agree to sponsorship deals that are felt to strongly contravene our editorial values.</p> <p>In general terms, however, there is a recognition that the Guardian's job is not to act as censor and that it also needs to attract advertising revenues to ensure its financial sustainability.</p> <p>This is made clear in the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainability/sustainability-vision\">sustainability vision</a>, which states: \"We recognise that tensions can arise between our need for advertising revenues to sustain our business and being a medium for promoting consumption. Our role is neither to hector our readers nor to censor on their behalf. Our editorial coverage informs and influences our audience in their choices.\"</p> <p>Even though GNM is facing a tough economic climate, the Guardian increased overall environmental and ethical revenue for the financial year ending March 2011.</p> <p>In fact, revenues from these areas on a like-for-like basis increased by 13%, compared with 3% total growth for ads and sponsorship revenues.</p> <p>GNM's environmental and ethical income has grown to a 5.9% share of total revenues. It is worth noting here that we miscalculated the percentage last year, stating it at 6.6% rather than the actual 5.4%.</p> <p>The main reason for this growth has been the expansion of business and professional sustainability services.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Thompson has said that he did not know that Jimmy Savile's behaviour was a \"pressing concern\" while he was BBC director general, but that if he had he would have \"acted very differently\".</p> <p>Thompson, who left the BBC in September and starts as chief executive of the New York Times Company next month, is facing scrutiny in the US about the Savile sex abuse scandal before taking up one of the most high-profile jobs in American media.</p> <p>\"I had no reason to believe that his conduct was a pressing concern,\" he said in an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/world/europe/mark-thompson-says-he-did-not-block-savile-program.html?ref=business&amp;_r=3&amp;\" title=\"\">interview with the New York Times</a> published on Tuesday. \"Had I known about the nature of the allegations and the credible allegations that these horrific crimes had taken place during his time at the BBC and in the building at the BBC, I of course would have considered them very grave and would have acted very differently.\"</p> <p>BBC foreign correspondent Caroline Hawley said that she thought she had told Thompson the \"broad context\" of the axed Newsnight investigation into Savile at a pre-Christmas drinks party at BBC Television Centre in late 2011.</p> <p>\"I think I must have mentioned the broad context of the investigation, but genuinely don't remember the words I used,\" she told The Times.</p> <p>In direct response to Hawley's allegation, a spokesman for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/jimmy-savile-scandal-mark-thompson\" title=\"\">Thompson admitted that he was aware that Newsnight was investigating Savile</a>.</p> <p>\"Mark attended a party late last year where a journalist mentioned the fact that Newsnight had been investigating Savile,\" the spokesman told The Times. \"The journalist said words to the effect that 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation'.</p> <p>\"This was the first that Mark had heard about the investigation.

Surely, they say, being as visible as technology and vanity permits is the only sensible option? Sceptics counter that such garish outfits a) perpetuate the idea that cycling is inherently unsafe, putting off would-be new riders and b) places responsibility/blame with the rider rather than encouraging drivers to be more vigilant.</p> <p>Having introduced that debate I'm now going to sideline it entirely to ask instead: if you're taking the high-vis route how far can you go? What weapons are in the armoury of the extreme high-vis-er? Here are two approaches, one tried out by myself, the other by Uli Kraeling, a reader. They're arguably not flattering, but they certainly get you seen:</p> <h2>The Visijax jacket</h2> <p>Even before its array of high-tech gizmos have been switched on, the <a href=\"http://visijax.com/home\">Visijax rain jacket</a> is perhaps the brightest single thing I've ever seen. An eye-melting yellow/lime shade which somehow transcends day-glo to approach outright luminescence, it is possibly visible from space. If that's not enough it's covered in reflective trim.</p> <p>But the British-designed jacket's main selling point comes when you press the button on a small plastic battery compartment tucked into an inner pocket. Suddenly, this is part jacket, part Christmas tree. Rows of tiny but very bright white LED lights flash on the front and some red ones at the back. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398267815\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/visijax_460.jpg\" alt=\"Bike Blog - Visijax high viz jacket\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Visijax jacket - part coat, part Christmas tree. Photograph: Visijax</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visijax</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sort of trickery we have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/green-living-blog/2010/nov/02/lights-visible-night\">seen before</a>. But the Visijax's party piece comes when you raise an arm to indicate a turn. All of a sudden sets of amber lights flash on the front and rear of the appropriate sleeve.</p> <p>The effect is certainly different, and whether or not you like it largely depends on personal taste. My view errs more towards \"a solution seeking a problem\", but then virtually all my night-time riding takes place in London, where darkness is a relative concept. I might take a different view if my ride took me into less well-lit outer suburbs, let alone rural roads.</p> <p>It's worth mentioning too, that the Visijax seems to function pretty well as a waterproof jacket, albeit one that's a bit on the baggy side for my tastes. It has a cosy fleece inner collar and, unlike some very high-viz products, is relatively lightweight and not inordinately sweaty.</p> <p>Did I feel a bit self conscious, blinking like a mobile traffic light, or pretend car, every time I lifted an arm? A bit. But I'm sure you get used to it.</p> <h2>The 'Polite' waistcoat</h2> <p>For more than three months I have been cycling with a kind of novelty hi-visibility jacket I found online. I was just looking for something that would be more durable than the building site hi-vis vests I used to wear. </p> <p>My <a href=\"http://www.highvisibility.uk.com/cycling/polite-cycling-waistcoat\">new waistcoat</a> features, in large, capitalised white-on-blue letters, the word \"Polite\" on the back, as well as blue and white reflective checkerboard detail around the shoulders. The intention is clear: to make road users think, at least on first glance, that you're a police officer on a bike.</p> <p>The website is full of satisfied customers feeding back how they felt like they had a forcefield around them when wearing the garment, so I decided to give it a try. In combination with my predominantly black cycling gear and a white helmet, the disguise is complete: whenever I see my own reflection in a passing car window, I nearly get caught out myself. </p> <p>So far I have refrained from acquiring the additional <a href=\"http://www.highvisibility.uk.com/cycling/polite-cycling-hat-band\">checkerboard helmet band</a> which complements the vest. There's a whole range of similar items, many for horse riders, for whom the idea was originally developed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398267816\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/polite.jpg\" alt=\"Bike blog - polite jacket\" width=\"460\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kraeling wearing the 'Polite' cycling jacket. Photograph: Uli Kraeling</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: reader</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since I started wearing this on my daily commute to and from Kingston in west London to Kings Cross in the north of the city, the vest has definitely had an effect, though not always in ways I might have expected. Friends and colleagues warned me not to cycle through any dodgy areas while wearing the outfit and I am sure I have had a bottle thrown at me the other day.</p> <p>Every now and then at red traffic lights fellow cyclists and even pedestrians inquire where I got the jacket, but so far I have never encountered a fellow wearer.</p> <p>The idea of this garment is obviously to get more respect on the road and I feel drivers have been reacting in different ways: I can hear a lot more braking and taking the foot of the gas going on behind me and I feel I do get a wider berth than before from some. With others, though, I feel like they want to emphasize they are not fooled by my disguise and so overtake closely with a revving engine.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, the vest has also changed my own behaviour on the road: I am now sticking a lot more to the Highway Code so as to keep up the disguise of a law enforcer \u2013 who would fall for a policeman going against the one-way system and jumping red lights? Getting a shorter haircut was a pure coincidence, though, and not an attempt to further deceive.</p> <p>Initially I was even concerned I might get arrested for impersonating a policeman but then found out it was actually a superintendent who devised this jacket. By now, I have passed so many police cars and bobbies on the beat without any problems that I am not worried anymore.</p> <p>The other morning, a motorist halted me and asked me to intervene in a traffic dispute \u2013 she was apparently being followed by another driver. Said driver pulled up next to me a few seconds later and addressed me directly: 'You should have heard what she said to me, officer!\" When the red mist of road rage comes up you are obviously more gullible. </p> <p>I revealed I was not a policeman and they sped off, still arguing at the next red light. I wish I had been more prepared for this situation. I mainly thought a policeman with a German accent would not seem very credible. Maybe the bike blog readers could suggest what to do if it happens again? </p> <p>Surprisingly even fellow cyclists can be fooled: I was told a group of road cyclist had put the brakes on behind me on a fast downhill section in Richmond Park, thinking I was a policeman about to enforce the 20mph speed limit.</p> <p>Would I recommend the \"Polite\" vest? It's certainly well made and looks the part. If you're undecided but would like to test the public's response, maybe try it out on a stag do/hen night, when it might be more acceptable to dress up as a policeman or woman.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Uli Kraeling, 34, is an architect originally from Munich, who rides for transport and for sport.</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Arm</strong> continues its recent surge, with the UK chip designer boosted by both the launch of Apple's mini iPad and the forthcoming unveiling of Microsoft's Windows 8.</p> <p>Its shares rose on Tuesday after it reported better than expected results, and they have climbed another 18p to 658p as analysts issued positive notes. Thursday sees the Windows 8 presentation, with Microsoft moving away from its long time partner Intel to create a second version for the tablet and smartphone market using Arm designs.</p> <p>Paul Morland at Peel Hunt raised his target price from 650p to 700p and said:</p> <blockquote> All the important metrics were at record levels just as Arm continues to diversify its market exposure and improve earnings quality. An investment case this strong is hard to value, but it is definitely a buy. <br> </blockquote> <p>Morgan Stanley was also positive, saying:</p> <blockquote> The results not only proved for a second quarter in a row that Arm could be resilient to a weakening semis environment but also showed continuing share gains and ASP increases. With Arm in the sweet spot for nearly every product launch (iPad mini and new iPad with bigger Arm ore), we remain overweight. </blockquote> <p>UBS issued a buy note although its analyst Gareth Jenkins outlined some risks to the outlook:</p> <blockquote> Arm's results and subsequent management meeting provided reassurance around many of the positive long term drivers of the business model including; addressing new end markets/market share wins (networking, microcontrollers aided the third quarter), penetrating hold-out customers (Broadcom networking, Renesas first foothold in microcontrollers), driving royalties up in established end markets and penetrating existing markets with new products <br> While there is much momentum for Arm currently, not least in licensing backlog, it is important to remember the risks, namely; the lack of maturity around new product areas (eg servers), device integration, possible high end smart phone market maturity and the loss of Apple to Intel. </blockquote> <p>Arm is leading the way in an uncertain <strong>FTSE 100</strong>, which has recovered from earlier losses to stand 8.24 points higher at 5806.13. European manufacturing and confidence figures were fairly downbeat but there was brighter news from China, where the HSBC purchasing managers index hit a three month high.</p> <p>Banks are among the main fallers thanks to their exposure to the flagging eurozone, with <strong>Barclays</strong> down 3.85p at 228.8p and <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> 2.4p lower at 275.3p.</p> <p>A handful of companies went ex-dividend, including <strong>BSkyB</strong>, down 8.5p at 712p.</p>",

Although the likes of Google, Samsung or Amazon have found a market opportunity for their smaller and cheaper tablets, as consumers started to realise what a tablet could be used for, but wanted a more portable and cheaper device. </p> <p>The seven-inch size, priced at around $200, with content provided from companies like Amazon or Google was expected to become a sweet spot in the market. Despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/oct/22/ipad-mini-steve-jobs-7in-tablets\">the position that Steve Jobs took against the 7-inch tablets</a>, Apple needed to respond, otherwise it would risk losing an important share of the tablet market. The popularity of the Kindle eReader and the Android smartphones made consumers aware of Amazon content and Google services. The low price points of the Google Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire have been attracting consumers looking for more affordable devices that also come with the content and services they already use or want.</p> <p>\"This new product from Apple will disrupt the market again. The iPad Mini is now the new category killer. Competitors will need to return to their R&amp;D centres and find ways to develop even cheaper versions of their products and figure out how to profit from the content, while Apple will continue to make a profit from the hardware and the content!</p> <p>\"The popularity of the brand, the iOS ecosystem and now a more affordable price will make the iPad mini a hot product this Christmas season. Despite a higher price and strong competition from the Google's Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire, Apple continues to deliver the best in class integration between software and hardware, delighting users with a rich content experience. </p> <p>\"When Apple launched the first iPad, consumers didn't know what to do with it, but they knew they loved and wanted it. Now Apple launches a product for those who always knew what to do with a tablet, but couldn't afford it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fred Huet</strong>, managing director at Greenwich Consulting thinks that discussion of \"missing features\" misses the point: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Today's launch of the iPad Mini could prove to be a pivotal moment in disrupting the 7-inch media tablet space, an area that Android vendors have largely operated in alone, up until this point. Whilst mini in size, this device is set to throw one almighty punch in the direction of all competitors, who have for so long now had a torrid time competing against the 10-inch iPad. The iPad Mini is a clear warning shot to all competitors that the world's most valuable company is not willing to share any of its 70% market share in the tablet industry, at least not without a strong fight.<br> \"As with all Apple launches, critics are always there to raise an eyebrow and discuss the missing features, and this is no exception. The lack of retina display for example was always to be expected, after all, one of Apple's biggest predicaments is that its current iPad is proving far too successful. This is a strange position to be in, but it must be remembered that the iPad Mini has been primarily launched to support its bigger brother and to maintain Apple's overall market share. The nightmare scenario for Apple would be if their latest device was so convincing that it substituted potential new iPad custom to a smaller model on a lower price tier, effectively cannibalising existing sales. \"Whether the iPad mini takes off among consumers remains to be seen. Sales are expected to be strong in Asia, and particularly China, where there is recognised consumer demand for a product of this size. Such a trend remains in its early stages in the UK, but with mobile screens becoming increasingly larger in size, this seems like a natural progression, something that Apple could capitalise upon. </p> <p>\"Over the years, Apple have been somewhat reserved when selecting screen sizes for each its mobile devices, as confirmed at the launch of the iPhone 5, a smartphone designed to stand 0.8 inch smaller than its key rival, the Samsung Galaxy SIII. Those past reservations however could now play into the hands of Apple, with the iPad Mini clearly positioned as a neat compromise to those seeking a mid-sized Apple device, one that is arguably too big to compete with a smartphone and yet small enough not to damage sales of the iPad. </p> <p>\"This is a strategy that Steve Jobs himself opposed in 2010, but is one that has become necessary today considering the growing consumer demand across the globe for mid-sized devices. Furthermore, this is a launch that would perhaps not be as beneficial for the likes of Samsung to execute, considering the vast array of sizes that already exist in its product range. Should the iPad Mini sell out with its premium price tag, competition will need to quickly find another point of differentiation, in order to take a hold on the tablet market, which is projected to stand at around $162bn by 2017.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ravi Kamran</strong>, chief executive of Trademob, a European app marketing platform, thinks the money is in the ecosystem: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"The tablet market is gaining steam. Initially Google and Amazon had to respond to the iPad, and they did so with their 7-inch tablets. Now it's Apple's turn to respond with the fourth-generation iPad and iPad Mini. Ultimately, when we see this kind of heated competition, it's consumers who benefit. At last count, there were about 225,000 apps optimised for the iPad \u2013 an impressive number, but only a fraction of the apps available on the iPhone. As more people purchase tablets, app developers will increasingly see an opportunity to make money from a market that has nowhere to go but up. </p> <p>\"Apple, Google and Amazon clearly view tablets as vehicles for content. For them, the money isn't there to be made with the hardware, but rather with the rich ecosystem of apps and similar content.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has risked a backlash from European carmakers and governments by rescuing France's Peugeot Citro\u00ebn with a \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.66bn) state-financing package, as Ford announced the loss of 4,300 jobs in Belgium.</p> <p>The German state of Lower Saxony, the second largest investor in Volkswagen, has already expressed opposition to the financing plan and Peugeot must also seek European Union approval for the deal. Meanwhile Ford said it would shut its Genk plant in Belgium as European carmakers grapple with too much factory capacity amid slumping sales. The French government is offering \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for Peugeot's financing arm, Banque PSA Finance, which underpins Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn dealer networks and car loans.</p> <p>\"The French state has announced its intention to provide up to \u20ac7bn in refinancing guarantees for new bond issues \u2026 A guarantee monitoring committee comprising representatives from the state and the group will be set up,\" said Peugeot, which has no French state shareholding and is 25%-owned by the Peugeot family.

Peugeot added that it will not pay dividends, launch share buybacks or grant share options to senior executives while the state guarantee is in place. It also agreed to elect an employee to its supervisory board and \"elect more women\". The board will also appoint a new independent member, although reports this week said that independent member would be government-approved.</p> <p>Jean-Marc Ayrault, the French prime minister, said Peugeot would be asked to reconsider the Aulnay closure as a condition of the financing. \"The government has no intention of making gifts without demanding anything in return,\" he said. It is France's biggest intervention in its car industry since 2009, when it gave Peugeot and Renault \u20ac6bn in low-interest loans.</p> <p>Peugeot said this morning that third-quarter sales fell 4% to \u20ac12.9bn in the three months to September. \"The competitive environment is getting tougher, with increased pricing pressure and ongoing deterioration in the markets of southern Europe,\" the company said.</p> <p>Peugeot is not the only Europe-based automotive business struggling with stagnant sales and too much manufacturing capacity. Ford said this morning that it plans to shut its assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, in 2014 with the loss of 4,300 jobs as production moves to Spain. Volvo, the Gothenburg-based truck maker, said it expected no growth in the European and US markets next year after third-quarter orders fell by a quarter compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>The French government gave a show of support to one its stonger industrial players this week. On Tuesday Ayrault attended the inauguration of the final assembly line for the Airbus A350 airplane in Toulouse. In a speech that referred to the pan-European structure of Airbus \u2013 the German, French and Spanish states are stakeholders \u2013 Ayrault also dwelt on France's industrial competitiveness. \"We need to be competitive because we need to fight unemployment this way,\" he said. Referring to the global success of Airbus, which has received orders for more than 550 A350 jets already, he added: \"It shows that France and Europe can be very successful in international competition.\"</p>",

Ban Ki-Moon had a chance to smooth out any flaws in his K-Pop repertoire on Tuesday when he was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uawoEjBvPxc\" title=\"\">visited at the United Nations</a> by Psy, the rapper behind the global hit Gangnam Style.</p> <p>\"I'm a bit jealous,\" Ban told reporters, as the pair joked about their shared nationality. \"Until two days ago someone told me I am the most famous Korean in the world. Now I have to relinquish. I have no regrets.\" Psy, whose song mocks the lifestyles of the wealthy residents of the Seoul neighbourhood of Gangnam, added: \"So now you have first and second famous Korean in the same building.\"</p> <p>The pair posed for the cameras with their hands in the now-familiar horseriding gesture made famous by the hit, which became the first South Korean song in history to go to No 1 in the UK pop charts. Ban even performed a few seconds of the riding motion alongside the 34-year-old singer before appearing to think the better of it.</p> <p>\"I know that you are here to see me dance but don't worry \u2013 I cannot even imitate your movement,\" he said.</p> <p>The secretary general was keen, though, to lavish praise on Psy, whose real name is Park Jae-sang. \"We have tough negotiations in the United Nations. In such a case I was also thinking of playing Gangnam Style-dance so that everybody would stop and dance. Maybe you can bring UN style?\" he said.</p> <p>Viewed more than 530m times on YouTube since it was released in mid-July, Gangnam Style has done its bit to unite nations around the world. Among the many tributes it has spawned are <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ2hFlLMBg4\" title=\"\">illegal flashmobs in Indonesia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/04/psy-gangnam-style-filipino-prisoners-video\" title=\"\">mass prisoner workouts</a> in the Philippines, and a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfzCkatPlU0\" title=\"\">co-ordinated cheerleading and marching band routine</a> in Oregon.</p> <p>\"I think the music can play a very important role. I hope that we can work together using your global reach&#xa0;\u2026 You have, I think, unlimited global reach,\" he told Psy.</p> <p>According to Reuters, he added: \"You are so cool; I hope that you can end the global warming.\"</p> <p>Earlier on, Ban met <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/video/2012/oct/14/felix-baumgartner-skydive-space-video\" title=\"\">Felix Baumgartner</a>, who last week became the first supersonic skydiver after jumping 24 miles from a balloon. Ban hailed the Austrian as \"the most courageous person in the world\".</p>",
  "<p>Retail is in demand as a career destination for graduates, while other more traditional sectors are cutting back. According to <a href=\"http://www.highfliers.co.uk/download/GMReport12.pdf\" title=\"\">High Fliers Research</a>, retail is the second fastest growing sector for graduate recruitment, with an increase of 44% in vacancies since 2007.</p> <p>The sector holds stereotypical images of working on a shop floor or stacking shelves, however many retailers now offer robust graduate schemes that open doors to a variety of roles in HR, buying and marketing etc. In fact, graduates are starting to cotton on to the opportunities that a career in retail could offer and graduate applications to employers in retail went up by 34% in 2011-2012.</p> <p>I spend a lot of time reviewing job applications \u2013 around 50 to 60 every month \u2013 and read through all the information to get a rounded picture of the applicant. A recruiters' nightmare is 'the one that got away' so it's a process that requires time and attention.</p> <p>Having said that, there are certain traits that indicate the right aptitude for success, so it's important to bring these out in your application. Beyond the obvious technical skills that might be required for a particular role, the three main things that retailers are looking for on CVs and in interviews are: evidence of leadership, responsibility and people skills.</p> <p>While it's important to show that you've put the time in studying to graduate with a good degree, we, like many other employers, are also looking for employable people with a good work ethic. So how can you show that you have these skills?</p> <h2>Show you're a leader, not a follower</h2> <p>Leadership qualities are critical to retailers. Graduates need to show initiative and authority in difficult situations. Put yourself forward for projects: it doesn't matter if this is in a business context or not \u2013 demonstrating your ability to get involved, co-ordinating a team and managing a project to a successful conclusion will be a great asset. In your job applications, talk about your aims, what you achieved, what you learnt along the way.</p> <p>It's really important that you don't undersell yourself. Don't undervalue how your experiences, however apparently trivial, may bring value to a prospective employer. This doesn't mean that you should misrepresent what you did \u2013 don't pretend you almost ran the restaurant if you were actually washing dishes. But be careful about how you describe experiences as it this may reveal a lot about how you see the role. After all, good dishwashing is critical to running a successful restaurant. The task may be menial but the role is crucial; show that you understand this when you talk about the experience.</p> <h2>Show you can be trusted</h2> <p>In a retail environment, you'll often be thrown in at the deep end and be given certain responsibilities from the beginning. Prepare for this by getting involved in university life. Being a member of clubs, societies and committees is valued highly by employers. Explain your positions of responsibility, such as being treasurer or club secretary. Why did you take on the role? Highlight your achievements, for example, \"we doubled our membership and increased club profits by 50% when I became secretary of the rowing club\".</p> <h2>Show that you're a people's person</h2> <p>In retail there's no getting away from the fact that you'll have to deal with people \u2013 whether it's customers, colleagues, managers, suppliers \u2013 there's a long list of relationships that you'll have to nurture.</p> <p>Work experience and internships can really help to develop the sort of people skills that retailers require. More companies are now offering internship programmes so it's always worth checking out corporate websites of companies to see if there are any opportunities for you to broaden your experience.</p> <p>Once you've secured a placement, the key to making it a success is to get involved in all aspects of the business. Participate in work-related networking and volunteering activities as these give you further opportunities for networking.</p> <p>LinkedIn provides an easy way to keep in touch with contacts and to build a network of business leaders that can help you now or in the future. Before you leave your work experience, ask your managers for a written reference and when connecting on LinkedIn, ask for as many recommendations as possible.</p> <p><em>Ashley Hever is european talent acquisition manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.enterprise.co.uk/car_rental/home.do\" title=\"\"><em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

A lot of comments have been made about this commitment. But we have to understand how markets work. Interventions are designed to send a clear signal to investors that their fears about the euro area are baseless.</p> <p>Second, as a pre-requisite for OMTs, countries must have negotiated with the other euro area governments a European Stability Mechanism (ESM) programme with strict and effective conditionality. This ensures that governments continue to correct economic weaknesses while the ECB is active. The involvement of the IMF, with its unparalleled track record in monitoring adjustment programmes would be an additional safeguard.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121024.en.html\">The full statement has been uploaded to the ECB website</a>.</p> <p>Draghi also warned that deflation is a bigger risk than inflation today, which may not convince German lawmakers who fear a return to the 1920s.</p> <p>Dow Jones Newswires' <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/djfxtrader\"><strong>FXTrader</strong></a> service tweets other highlights:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082243638886400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Sees Weak Economy In Near Term, Gradual Recovery in 2013</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082243638886400\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:30:32+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082649303605248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Tells German Lawmakers Governments Alone Could Not Remove Fear</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082649303605248\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:32:08+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082759487971329\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>ECB's Draghi Says ECB Only \"Fully Credible Backstop\" Could Remove Market Fear</p>&mdash; DJ FX Trader (@djfxtrader) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/djfxtrader/status/261082759487971329\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:32:35+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:56:31.068Z\">at 1.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087e10695cb4897f0db525c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:37:26.540Z\">1.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Germany denies Greek deal is done</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>News is flashing up that Germany has denied that Greece has got the two-year extension (as finance minister Stournaras claimed - see last few posts).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/261080782012039168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>***German government spokesman says there is no basis for the Greek 2-year extension reports***</p>&mdash; Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/261080782012039168\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-24T12:24:43+00:00\">October 24, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Curiouser and curiouser.

  "<p>You would expect that when a local authority takes children into its care, it automatically accepts the responsibility of protecting and nurturing their young lives. Currently, however, almost half the young people in residential care are living outside the boundaries of the authority that looks after them \u2013 sometimes far outside.</p> <p>The Department for Education leaves us in the dark on the reasons for this and we are left to speculate: perhaps it's a simple case of too few residential homes in one area and a surplus in another, or maybe there's a financial factor behind it.</p> <p>There are, of course, cases where placing a young person away from their own area is in their best interests, for their safety. There may even be instances where the young people are thankful, for good reasons, to be living \"away from home\". In many more cases, however, I wonder how appropriate it is for children and young people to be removed from a familiar environment and taken to some far-away town or city.</p> <p>An important consideration when moving a young person out of their area is how it affects their relationships with others. Relationships, especially significant ones, take time to build and grow \u2013 like the close friend they can trust and talk to about their hopes and dreams for the future, or the aunt, uncle or other adult they have come to respect and who supports and advises them when they need it. These relationships are very precious things and offer comforts and securities for looked-after children that cannot be obtained any other way; the implications of severing them are significant.</p> <p>And remember that when the young person arrives at a \"home\", they are the outsider. They may find it hard to trust others and strike up new friendships. It is at this point that they need to be able to call on those important relationships that they have built up.</p> <p>Transparency may be the key. Wherever possible we need to keep these young people close to their \"home turf'\". To minimise the danger and/or damage they may face, we must first know why a looked-after child or young person is being moved to a residential home outside their local authority area. If the reasons given are unconvincing, then it simply should not be happening.</p> <p>Maxine Wrigley is co-ordinator of A&#xa0;National Voice, an organisation run for and by young people who are or have been in care</p>",
  "<p>Despite the unprecented scale, pace and focus of the government's public service cuts, a lack of overall workforce planning means it is almost impossible to predict the longer-term implications of the cuts for the wider labour market, for particular groups being affected and for regional employment.</p> <p>The government has embarked on a major programme of public service cuts on an unprecedented scale and pace. Many of the cuts will fall in areas such as health, education, social services and the police, areas which the Margaret Thatcher and John Major governments largely spared. Yet we know remarkably little about the implicationson the country's workforce.</p> <p><a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)</a> has made some<a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.independent.gov.uk/category/topics/economic-forecasts/\" title=\"\"> global predictions</a> of total losses between now and 2017. But this is essentially an educated guess. The OBR has also given up trying to give a more accurate profile of when and where the cuts might fall, because the government has made it clear that it has no intention of introducing workforce planning for public services as a whole.</p> <p>Past experience tells us that the UK labour market can cope with large-scale reductions in the public sector workforce, and to date the cuts have beenbalanced by strong private sector hires.But if private sector job growth falters, public sector job cuts will feed through into higher unemployment and higher levels of economic inactivity.</p> <p>What we know about the impact of the workforce cuts thus far can be summarised as follows:</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0; Nearly one million who said they were employed in the public sector at the end of 2010 had left by the end of&#xa0;2011 \u2013 far more than can be accounted for by public sector job cuts. It is a significant concern that many of those leaving the sector are moving out of the workplace altogether, rather than into new jobs. This could have long-term consequences for growth.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0; Although female workers make up the majority of job losses from the public sector, male public sector employment has fallen faster in percentage terms than female public sector employment to date. Some commentators have blamed the cuts for the relatively weak growth in women's employment. But this is at best only a partial explanation. Jobs held by women account for most of the jobs being cut, but male employment across the sector has been falling faster in percentage terms. More importantly, many of the new jobs in less well-paid areas such as administrative, personal, and retail services, which have been traditionally dominated by women, have been going to men. In the two years to April-June 2012, employment across these occupations went up twice as fast for men as for women.</p> <p>\u2022 Claims that cutting public sector pay in the regions would help encourage private sector employment are not convincing given high levels of unemployment and lack of demand. There are also particular blind spots around the long-term implications for the regions \u2013 if we find it hard to make predictions at the national level, it is all but impossible at the regional level. No clear pattern has yet emerged. There is however, no convincing evidence that cuts in public sector wages in lower wage regions will \"crowd in\" private sector jobs at current levels of unemployment.</p> <p>What is consistently striking about this picture is just how little the government knows about the wider implications of these cutbacks.</p> <p>We believe the Cabinet Office and the Office for Manpower Economics could do a lot more to provide policymakers and public service managers with an overview of how the cuts are reshaping the public sector labour market and the wider impact on particular groups. This would also help the OBR get a grip on the scale and profile of the cuts in the public sector workforce and therefore the wider implications for the economy. Without such an overview, the government is essentially flying blind.</p> <p><em>Ian Brinkley is director of </em><a href=\"http://www.theworkfoundation.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Work Foundation</em></a><em> and is the author of </em><a href=\"http://www.theworkfoundation.com/Reports/323/Public-Loss-Private-Gain\" title=\"\"><em>Public Loss, Private Gain?</em></a></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>The UN high-level panel to draw up a post-2015 strategy, co-chaired by Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, is expected to hand in its first draft around March and submit its final report in May, a senior official said on Tuesday.</p> <p>The UN has launched a broad consultation process, which makes the timetable particularly ambitious. The <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/reports.shtml\" title=\"\">millennium development goals (MDGs)</a>, although considered to have had a galvanising effect on the development discourse, were seen as having been foisted on developing countries by donors.</p> <p>This time round, the UN will be co-ordinating consultations in more than 50 developing countries to help gather input. As an example of its outreach programme, the UN has set up a website inviting contributions from civil society. The <a href=\"http://www.worldwewant2015.org/Post2015HLP\" title=\"\">site is asking for input ahead of next week's meeting of the three co-chairs of the panel in London</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/25/replacing-millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">Cameron briefly met his two co-chairs, Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, at the UN general assembly in September</a>. London, where the theme will be household poverty, will be the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">substantive meeting of the panel's 26 members</a> and the UN's special adviser on post-2015 development planning, Amina Mohammed. Subsequent meetings in Liberia and Indonesia will focus on national development and global partnerships respectively.</p> <p>At a hearing of the international development committee, Mohammed said she hoped the panel would produce a \"bold and ambitious report\" that would feed into the post-2015 development agenda. While it was too soon to go into detail about the panel's report, she mentioned a number of themes it will contain: the poverty agenda, conflict, the youth bulge, and how to deal with the unmet MDGs.</p> <p>The existing targets, which were agreed at a meeting in New York in September 2000, set out eight goals for the international community, including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, and reducing childhood mortality rates.</p> <p>Some of those goals in some countries are expected to be achieved by the 2015 deadline; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/13/world-target-development-goal-child-mortality\" title=\"\">others most definitely will not</a>. But the MDGs have had an enormous impact on the international donor community and how it spends its money.</p> <p>Some MPs wondered how the panel's report would mesh with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/23/rio-20-earth-summit-document\" title=\"\">sustainable development goals that emerged from the Rio+20 Earth summit</a>. Mohammed acknowledged that there were two processes \u2013 the high-level panel and a working group on sustainability \u2013 but said they shared one secretariat and the end result would be \"one development agenda\". Asked who would lead the political process, she replied that it would be the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon.</p> <p>According to Charles Abugre Akeylyria, Africa regional director of the UN millennium campaign, the consultation process has \"kicked off a bit of a buzz\" \u2013 both at a national level, where community hearings are planned, and also in regional terms, with the African Development Bank and the African Union pitching in. \"This buzz is useful,\" he told the committee. \"It's how we pool all this buzz into the report. This is very different from the MDGs, which were concocted by the elite.\"</p> <p>Professor Andrew Dorward, from the School of Oriental and African Studies, underlined the difficulty of getting real bottom-up participation, citing the example of poor smallholder farmers. \"It's time consuming and it is difficult to get poor farmers represented, but it's not unique to agriculture,\" he said.</p> <p>More broadly, Dorward said the panel had to decide whether its objective was to mobilise resources, enlist support for the <a href=\"http://www.globaldashboard.org/2012/04/25/christmas-tree-jigsaw-or-bullseye-a-rough-guide-to-post-2015-frameworks/\" title=\"\">post-2015 agenda</a>, or both. Asked what he thought such a framework would look like, he called for as holistic an approach as possible, combining overarching goals such as wellbeing, health, climate change, population stabilisation and water. As a concept the MDGs had been successful, he said, as they had been easy to grasp and communicate.</p>",
  "<p>The anger surrounding the government's proposed requisitioning of over \u00a31.5bn currently earmarked for councils to spend on local family projects <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog/2012/oct/09/sure-start-confusion-over-cuts-nursery-care\" title=\"\">continues to grow</a>, to the extent that even senior Tories are now demanding to know why ministers appear to be so keen to take money away from specialist services for vulnerable children.</p> <p>As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/27/free-nursery-places-funded-sure-start\" title=\"\">reported in September</a>, councils are up in arms over government plans to scrap next April the \u00a32.3bn Early Intervention Grant (EIG), out of which councils pay for a range of family support services, including Sure Start, parenting support and short breaks for disabled people.</p> <p>The money that makes up the grant will be then divvied up three ways over the subsequent two years: \u00a31.3bn will go to a ringfenced schools grant to pay for free nursery care for two year olds; \u00a3300m will be top-sliced by the Department for Education for purposes unclear; and the remainder will be rolled into councils' central revenue stream.</p> <p>Councils say this will translate into a 20% reduction in early intervention spending at local level.</p> <p>This week the Conservative leader of the Local Government Association (LGA), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/16/localism-government-tighten-grip-councils-cash\" title=\"\">Sir Merrick Cockell</a>, wrote to Michael Gove, the education secretary, asking him to justify the move.</p> <p>The letter, released by the LGA last night, focuses first on the \u00a3150m the Department for Education proposes to take for itself in each of the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15.</p> <p>Cockell's letter states:</p> <blockquote> As you would expect, we are very anxious to understand how the money withheld will be used, as it is funding for frontline services for vulnerable children, in an extremely tight financial environment. As you know, Early Intervention Grant already represented a substantial cash cut compared to the sources of funding it replaced; the additional \u00a3150m top-slice appears to suggest the government wants to see a further reduction of around \u00a31m by each council in early support to children, young people and families that need it most. </blockquote> <p>It goes on:</p> <blockquote> I fear this move is counter-productive because it will force local authorities to cut early intervention services even further which will inevitably lead to increased demand for more costly longer-term/lifelong interventions. </blockquote> <p>Cockell adds:</p> <blockquote> When combined with removing the money for expansion of provision for two year olds into the ringfenced Dedicated Schools Grant, this constitutes a fall in non-ringfenced resources of 27%. Removing local authorities freedom to allocate funding inevitably means greater pressures on other services. </blockquote> <p>Cockell finishes with a polite demand for the money to be returned. It is clear that Cockell and the LGA are not satisfied with the government's explanations thus far. In the Lords a fortnight ago, Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/susan-garden/35605\" title=\"\">Baroness Garden of Frognal</a> declared:</p> <blockquote> It has become clear that local authorities and others believe that \u00a3534 million will be removed from the early intervention grant in 2013 and transferred to the dedicated school grant, but this is not the case. The department consulted earlier this year on the proposals to transfer funding from the EIG to the dedicated school grant, and the change was supported in the consultation, but the two year-old offer is funded with \u00a3760 million of new money, as announced in the Autumn Statement. So it is not true to say that it is being funded through cuts to children's centres, which indeed is not what we would wish. </blockquote> <p>In other words: the government admits that the money currently spent by councils on early years services is being switched to the Dedicated Schools Grant account, which happens also to pay for the free nursery scheme. But you would be wrong to assume that it is the same money.</p> <p>Miraculously, in the process of switching the cash between accounts it seems the old money marked \"early intervention grant\" becomes \"new money\" marked \"free nursery care for two year olds\".</p> <p>It is hard not to agree with another senior Tory local politician, who has <a href=\"http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Council-boss-questions-pay-free-nursery-places/story-17039678-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">described the way the Coalition has justified the move as</a>:</p> <blockquote> Typical smoke and mirrors </blockquote> <p>Whether it is old money or new money, the LGA is adamant (<a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/web/guest/briefings-and-responses/-/journal_content/56/10171/3736125/ARTICLE-TEMPLATE\" title=\"\">in its very clear briefing on the subject</a>) that the effect on frontline services of scrapping the EIG will be negative:</p> <blockquote> Removing the two-year-old money to the ringfenced Dedicated Schools Grant is counter-productive and will lead to significant cost pressures in the longer term... Local authorities will be less able to provide support for children and families affected by disabilities... </blockquote> <p>It's concern is shared by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Tickell\" title=\"\">Dame Claire Tickell</a>, the chief executive of charity Action for Children, which has championed the early intervention agenda. Responding to the LGA letter she said:</p> <blockquote> The uncertainty about the future of the Early Intervention Grant is potentially disastrous for local services which would be unable to plan confidently for the future. <br>We're seeing the number of families coming to our children's centres needing help rising - when they are already stretched as it is. If we don't act now we'll have even greater problems to support when we have even less money to do something about it \u2013 a perfect storm. <br>We know that Children's Centres work and that they provide proven benefits to the tax payer \u2013 but without the backing of the Early Intervention Grant, local authorities are going to be forced to make impossible choices with even tighter budgets. </blockquote>",
  "<p>The incoming chief executive of the New York Times is facing new questions over what he knew about the Jimmy Savile paedophile scandal when he was director general of the BBC, amid apparent inconsistencies in his public statements.</p> <p>Mark Thompson is due to start his new job on 12 November, but the NYT's public editor, or ombudsman, questioned his suitability for the role in a <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/times-must-aggressively-cover-mark-thompsons-role-in-bbcs-troubles/\">blogpost on Tuesday</a>. In her article, Margaret Sullivan called for the paper to cover Thompson's knowledge of the scandal and allegations of a cover-up \"more aggressively\".</p> <p>Adding to his woes with his new employer, Thompson is now attempting to reconcile two apparently contradictory statements over what he knew about a TV report into Savile by the BBC's Newsnight programme. The report was pulled in December 2011, and the allegations of abuse were eventually aired earlier this month on rival network ITV. </p> <p>The decision by the Newsnight editor, Peter Rippon, to kill the story is now the subject of<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/16/jimmy-savile-scandal-bbc-inquiry-heads\"> an independent inquiry</a>. Rippon has already<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/22/bbc-newsnight-jimmy-savile-scandal\"> had to \"step aside\" from his post</a>. </p> <p>Amid questions over whether he will be able to start his new job as planned on 12 November, Thompson gave an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/world/europe/mark-thompson-says-he-did-not-block-savile-program.html?ref=business&amp;_r=2&amp;\">interview to the New York Times on Wednesday </a>in which he insisted he had not done anything that would \"impede my ability\" to join the organisation.</p> <p>Thompson, whose role as director general also carried the designation \"editor in chief\", made his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/world/europe/silence-on-jimmy-savile-abuse-reports-plunges-bbc-into-scandal.html\">first statement about the scandal to the New York Times on 13 October </a>. </p> <p>He said: \"I was not notified or briefed about the Newsnight investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to complete and air the investigation. I have no reason to doubt the public statement by the programme's editor, Peter Rippon, that the decision not to pursue the investigation was entirely his, and that it was made solely for journalistic reasons.\"</p> <p>He added: \"During my time as director general of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile.\"</p> <p>But in response to inquiries by the Times newspaper in London, which is not connected to the New York Times, Thompson admitted through his spokesman that he was aware that Newsnight was investigating Savile. The spokesman told the London-based Times: \"Mark attended a party late last year where a journalist mentioned the fact that Newsnight had been investigating Savile. The journalist said words to the effect that 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation'.</p> <p>\"This was the first that Mark had heard about the investigation. The journalist did not go into what Newsnight was investigating. Mark did not respond at the party but did mention the conversation to senior colleagues in BBC News and asked if there was a problem with the investigation.</p> <p>\"He was told that Newsnight had begun an investigation into Savile but had decided to drop it for journalistic reasons. Mark assumed that this meant that the decision not to proceed had been taken by Peter Rippon.</p> <p>\"He was not told anything about the allegations Newsnight had been looking at. The first time he became aware of the allegations that Savile had committed serious crimes and that some had taken place in the course of his employment at the BBC was when he heard the 'pre-publicity' for the ITV investigation. This was after he had stepped down as director general.\"</p> <p>Thompson's spokesman told the Guardian there was \"no contradiction\" between the two positions.</p> <p>\"Mark told the New York Times he was not briefed on the Newsnight investigation. He wasn't. As he made clear yesterday he was only made aware of the allegations relating to Jimmy Savile when ITV published pre-broadcast publicity regarding their documentary in recent weeks,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>Thompson's spokesman insisted to the Guardian that he stood by both statements and said there was no inconsistency between them. But Thompson's position appears to rest on the difference between being \"made aware\" and being \"notified or briefed\". The BBC journalist who spoke to Thompson at the party, Caroline Hawley, told the Times of London on Wednesday that while she could not remember exactly what she said, she was likely to have given the \"broad context\" of the allegations.</p> <p>In his interview with the New York Times on Tuesday, Thompson conceded he had been told of the investigation but insisted that he did not know of the specifics and had not put any pressure on the Newsnight team. \"I did not impede or stop the Newsnight investigation, nor have I done anything else that could be construed as untoward or unreasonable.\" </p> <p>Rob Wilson, a Conservative MP, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article3577578.ece\">told the London Times:</a> \"Mark Thompson has already had to clarify his version of events once. He originally implied that he knew nothing about the Newsnight investigation, before admitting that a BBC journalist had told him he had reasons to worry about it. Now there are questions about whether he was told more about the subject of the Newsnight investigation than he has previously admitted.\"</p> <p>The inquiry into which BBC executives knew what and when is in danger of overshadowing the initial story into the abuse conducted by Savile over his 40-year career as a radio DJ and TV host. George Entwistle, Thompson's successor as director general, gave a faltering performance<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/bbc-newsnight-jimmy-savile\"> before a committee of MPs on Tuesday</a>, where he was accused of a \"lack of curiosity\" over the Newsnight investigation. </p> <p>Thompson has said that he will return to London to face MPs if he is called to appear. His position at the New York Times was put under significant strain this week when Sullivan, the public editor, asked whether he was the \"right person for the job,\" given the importance attached to integrity at the paper. She suggested that the NYT should cover the story more aggressively. In her blogpost, she asked: \"How likely is it that he knew nothing?\"</p> <p>Questioning Thompson's suitability, Sullivan wrote: \"How likely is it that the Times Company will continue with its plan to bring Mr Thompson on as chief executive? (It's worth noting that as public editor, I have no inside knowledge on such corporate matters.) His integrity and decision-making are bound to affect the Times and its journalism \u2013 profoundly. It's worth considering now whether he is the right person for the job, given this turn of events.\"</p> <p>In his New York Times interview, Thompson said: \"It is my belief that there isn't anything in my participation or my role in this story that would impede my ability to join and work with my colleagues at The New York Times.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for the New York Times Company said he would join as planned on 12 November. \"We believe his experience and accomplishments make him the ideal person to take the helm of the Times Company as we focus on growing our businesses through digital and global expansion,\" the spokeman told the NYT.</p> <p>The vice-president of corporate communications at the New York Times, Eileen Murphy, said it would not comment on the public editor's questioning of Thompson's suitability. Murphy said: \"The public editor is an independent voice in the newsroom and she is doing her job. We do not make a habit of commenting on her columns.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2012. The original said Margaret Sullivan rebuked Mark Thompson.
