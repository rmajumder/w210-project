In the Republican primaries, candidates queued up to pour scorn on the very notion of man-made climate change. And now Bloomberg has made their party \u2013 which he was once a member of \u2013 pay the ultimate political price.</p> <p>Bloomberg then fires a lethal shot at Romney:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Interestingly, a close reading of Bloomberg essay makes it seem that he was planning to endorse Obama before Sandy.

Of course, he knows in current circumstances no sane person would really push defence spending, projected to fall below 3% of GDP, to 4%; of course President Romney would strike a deal that raises overall tax revenues, even if he cuts tax rates.</p> <p>However, even if you accept that Romneynomics may be more numerate in practice than it is in theory, it is far harder to imagine that he will reverse course entirely. When politicians get elected they tend to do quite a lot of the things they promised during their campaigns. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, France\u2019s famously pliable new president, was supposed to be too pragmatic to introduce a 75% top tax rate, yet he is steaming ahead with his plan. We weren\u2019t fooled by the French left; we see no reason why the American right will be more flexible. Mr Romney, like Mr Hollande, will have his party at his back \u2014 and a long record of pandering to them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well that's the Balliol College SCR vote gone for Romney. Finally, the Economist concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of <em>The Economist</em>\u2019s readers, especially those who run businesses in America, may well conclude that nothing could be worse than another four years of Mr Obama. We beg to differ.

Internal surveys conducted for candidates like George Allen in Virginia, Richard Mourdock in Indiana and Josh Mandel in Ohio draw much rosier conclusions than polls conducted for their Democratic counterparts Tim Kaine, Joe Donnelly and Sherrod Brown. And media surveys, at least in Virginia and Ohio, show Kaine and Brown winning (restrictive Indiana laws make polling prohibitively expensive there).</p> <p>Republicans say their party is a victim of media bias \u2013 but not in the standard Lamestream Media sort of way. Pollsters on both sides try to persuade public surveyors that their voter turnout models are more accurate reflections of what's going to happen on Election Day. This year, GOP pollsters and strategists believe those nonpartisan pollsters are adopting Democratic turnout models <em>en masse</em>.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Reid's conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Republicans believe Democrats are counting far too much on low-propensity voters and a booming minority turnout that isn't going to materialize on Election Day. Democrats believe Republicans are hopelessly reliant on an electorate that looks far more like their party than the nation as a whole. The day after Election Day, somebody's pollsters are going to be proven seriously wrong.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T17:05:24.997Z\">at 5.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5092a8b695cb1506d24446df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:52:06.508Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Obama for America is back on the offensive with another smack at <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>'s \"let Detroit go bankrupt\" comment.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP41ogzwsBk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FP41ogzwsBk?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There's no telling how much damage a dumb remark can do \u2013 and this is an example of something that was never an issue in the GOP primary \u2013 Romney won <strong>Michigan</strong> \u2013 but blows up big time in the general election.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5092a3bfb579f74bac7648de\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T16:30:55.588Z\">4.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Nate Silver v Joe Scarborough</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>For fans of media-politics inside baseball: Many <strong>Republicans</strong> and <strong>Politico</strong> have been engaged in bizarre guerrilla warfare aimed at the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">New York Times' polling guru</a> <strong>Nate Silver</strong>, whose election model was the only thing keeping the Democratic party from headless panic while the Romney surge was at its height last month.</p> <p>The motivations of the those involved at throwing mud at Silver is suspect \u2013 the Republicans because it punctures their narrative of inevitable Mittmentum and Politico because of jealousy.

  "<p>\u2022 It is not enough for these eco campaigners to have the will to occupy gas and power stations. They've got to have the knowhow, which they have in spades; but, crucially, they have to have the gear. This week 11 activists from the group No Dash for Gas successfully scaled a 91m (300ft) metal chimney at a gas-fired power station in West Burton, Nottinghamshire. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">Another six occupied a second one that was not yet in use, securing themselves on ledges</a>. How did that happen? Cast back to 2009 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/14/police-arrests-environment-campaigners\" title=\"\">and the attempted invasion of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station</a>, also in Nottinghamshire. That was thwarted as the result of infiltration of a protest group by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2012/jul/16/mark-kennedy-spying-on-drax-activists\" title=\"\">libidinous undercover policeman Mark Kennedy</a>. A pre-emptive raid uncovered the plan and loads of the protesters' equipment, including hard hats, climbing harnesses, ropes and sleeping bags. Well, as you know, the secret and carnal activities of Kennedy came to light, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/20/police-spy-on-climate-activists-unlawful\" title=\"\">resulting in all convictions arising from the Ratcliffe-on-Soar prosecutions being quashed</a>; and as a byproduct of that fiasco, the police were obliged to return the confiscated equipment. Much of which was used for this week's occupation in West Burton. But isn't that the great thing about our police. Always there to help.</p> <p>\u2022 After the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/cameron-commons-defeat-eu-budget\" title=\"\">humiliating loss of that vote on the EU budget</a>, meanwhile, the blame game begins in earnest. Big Dave has had three chief whips since ascending to leadership of the country. But, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/19/in-praise-of-philip-cowley\" title=\"\">political analyst Philip Cowley pointed out</a> on talk radio station LBC 97.3, two of the three have manifestly failed him. In 2011 Patrick McLoughlin, since exiled to transport, lost a vote on the state of the economy \u2013 the government was defeated by 213 votes to 79. And the incumbent, Sir George Young, has his fingerprints on the latest debacle. The only chief whip Dave could trust was Andrew Mitchell, whose record for herding and bullying colleagues remained unblemished. But he started swearing at the wrong people. The stuff of tragedy.</p> <p>\u2022 But then, the lot of a chief whip was never a particularly happy one. We see that at the National Theatre, where politicos are rushing to the Cottesloe to see <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/this-house\" title=\"\">This House</a>, a play about the whips offices in the 1970s. As Labour and Tory whips scheme and plot, the audience watches from benches positioned to replicate government and opposition in the Commons. And on Tuesday, one of the visitors was the former MP <a href=\"http://www.johnhoram.com/\" title=\"\">John Horam</a>. The question, where would he sit? For Horam was elected for Labour, defected to the SDP and then migrated to the Tories, for whom he represented Orpington in Kent until the last election. He opted for the Labour benches, where he sat in the 70s when the action was unfolding. Presumably for old times' sake.</p> <p>\u2022 The squeeze is on and money's tight, but if the Met's really that hard up, wouldn't it make sense for it to sell the contents of the Crime Museum at New Scotland Yard, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/30/scotalnd-yard-sell-met-costs?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">rather than the building itself</a>? It's worth millions. There are now websites such as murderauction.com that sell such stuff \u2013 their slogan is \"every man has to have a hobby\", a quote from an old murderer and bodysnatcher called Ed Gein. What the Met has got \u2013 items from Dr Crippen, the Krays, death masks from people hanged at Newgate and so on \u2013 would bring in loads of cash on eBay and elsewhere. A roulette wheel from one of the Krays' old clubs has recently been valued at \u00a35,000. Think what the cooker belonging to serial killer Dennis Nilsen, his partner in grisly crimes, would be worth.</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, the squeeze is on and amid the perils of life in the economic downturn, more advice from Spear's, <a href=\"http://www.spearswms.com/in-this-issue/\" title=\"\">the magazine for the super wealthy</a>. Last year's riots may have been just a precursor to nastier happenings. If the revolution starts, they'll take everything, says the magazine. \"Although revolution seems unlikely, art collectors should be under no illusion that, were it ever to happen, their art would be a target, irrespective of their nationality or background; and revolutionaries have tended to find that the easiest way to deal with the owners of art they confiscate has been to execute them by axe (Charles I), guillotine (Louis XVI) or firing squad (Tsar Nicholas).\" Nasty. That lithograph of dogs playing cards. We've locked it away.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Christian Horner on Thursday hailed Red Bull's third successive year of domination in Formula One as \"for sure our biggest achievement.\" And the team principal suggested that Sebastian Vettel could go on to emulate and even beat Michael Schumacher's record of seven titles when he said: \"I can quite easily see him with us for another five years.\"</p> <p>Red Bull are poised to become only the fourth team to win a hat-trick of constructors' championship in Abu Dhabi this weekend. Vettel, meanwhile, is favourite to land another hat-trick \u2013 the drivers' title \u2013 in Texas or Brazil later this month.</p> <p>Horner could be forgiven his moment of pride, because his claims are justified. Formula One, dreading another period of monotonous domination so soon after the Schumacher/Ferrari era, changed the rules this year, especially in relation to the blown diffuser and the flexi-wing, to emasculate the runaway bulls from Milton Keynes.</p> <p>The plan was to drag Red Bull back into the pack. And for the first two thirds of the season, it worked. But the old order has been restored, with Vettel winning the last four grands prix; he has led every lap of the last three races, equalling Ayrton Senna's 1989 record.</p> <p>Referring to the rule changes that were designed to bring an end to his team's hegemony, Horner said: \"Formula One has a history of doing that sort of thing. Look at active suspension, or you can go back 20 years and see it. I think we saw a big regulation change which had a big effect on our performance. We have not moaned or complained about it, we have just worked hard on the same sheet of paper as everyone else.</p> <p>\"It is uncomfortable [for some people] the success that Sebastian has had and uncomfortable for some the success that Red Bull has had. That's not our fault.\"</p> <p>Time and again, Horner talk about the ethos of a successful team. \"It is very simplistic to say it is all about [chief technical officer] Adrian Newey. Yes, it's Adrian's team but you have to have all of the elements doing their bit. I liken it to a conductor \u2013 you can have the greatest conductor in the world but if you haven't got the right string instruments or wind instruments, the music will be rubbish.\"</p> <p>But Horner's efforts were in vain because Newey and Vettel were the only members of the team his audience wanted to talk about. \"Adrian is the greatest designer in Formula One since Colin Chapman. What he has achieved is unprecedented, in the modern world of F1 and we have created an environment that has got the best out of Adrian, one that he enjoys and feels stimulated in.\"</p> <p>Red Bull's domination is looking dangerously like an epoch. And if they do go on to match Ferrari, Horner feels it will be the greater achievement. \"The difference between that time and now is that then you had total freedom. You had competition of tyre manufacturers, you had total freedom of testing, and there was no one else operating at Ferrari at Schumacher's level. Whereas now, the way the regulations are, everybody's got the same tyres and everybody is allowed the same amount of testing.</p> <p>\"It's much more constricted and restricted. So to achieve success now, and dominance, is arguably a lot harder than it was in that period.</p> <p>\"This year, we have worked really, really well and effectively because we quite often haven't had the quickest car. On those days, the drivers \u2013 particularly Sebastian \u2013 have dragged the best out of it.\"</p> <p>Horner reserved his most fulsome praise for the driver who \u2013 aged only 25 \u2013 could equal Sir Jackie Stewart's record of 27 victories in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.</p> <p>\"What Sebastian has achieved in a relatively short period has been hugely impressive. And he will get better. That's the exciting thing about him.</p> <p>\"He's driving better this year compared to last year, and he drove better in 2011 than he did in 2010 because his experience is growing and his character is continuing to evolve. You forget what a young guy he is.\"</p> <p>Formula One is expected to have a fourth British driver next season, with Max Chilton tipped to take over from Charles Pic at Marussia. Chilton, who organises his own sponsorship and has a multimillionaire father, will take Pic's place in the first practice session on Friday. The 21-year-old said: \"I'm a racer and I want to get a race seat. I'd love the chance, and hopefully it will come soon. I'd like to do a good job, but it would be a bit silly for an F1 team to try to work out whether you are ready with just one session.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"The third coming of Berg\" was how Blackburn's ever-quotable global adviser Shebby Singh heralded Henning's arrival as Rovers manager. The Norwegian won Premier League and League Cup titles during two stints as a player at Ewood Park but those notable achievements will be eclipsed should he heal a divided club and lift it out of the Championship at the first attempt.</p> <p>Singh left no one, least of all Berg, in any doubt as to what Venky's want from their choice to succeed the calamitous Steve Kean as manager. \"Promotion is the minimum and the maximum,\" he said of this season's target. \"We have emphasised that time and again but the most important thing is that Henning welcomes the pressure, he welcomes the challenge. He didn't sit in front of us and say: 'I need three years to build a team or two seasons to get them promoted.' He said: 'I know what you want and I want to be the man to deliver that.'\"</p> <p>The initial reaction to Berg's appointment among Blackburn supporters suggests judgment is reserved on that score, though no one disputes the 43-year-old must succeed following the club's rapid decline since Venky's bought control two years ago. Lessons have been learned. Berg will not have to make regular trips to visit Venky's owner Anuradha Desai in India, as Kean did, and will have a greater say on transfer targets, as Kean allegedly did not.</p> <p>Rovers' new manager needed to do his own repair work before signing a three-year contract having delivered a scathing assessment of Venky's following the club's relegation in May. Working as a television pundit in Norway, Berg had said: \"There are no real managers with credibility who would accept a job like that.\"</p> <p>As the man who accepted that job, he now explains: \"Those comments were made by me looking in from the outside. Now I know what is happening on the inside and I know what the owners have done in the summer. They are making big decisions. They are putting money in and buying players like Leon Best, Jordan Rhodes, Danny Murphy, Dickson Etuhu and Nuno Gomes; big, important players for this team. They are showing their intent by changing the management as well. They are taking the club in the right direction, looking to make sure this club gets back into the Premier League.\"</p> <p>Berg started his managerial career with three productive seasons at Lyn before a difficult period at Lillestrom ended in dismissal last year. \"They had been going for the championship when the economic crisis set in and then really struggled financially,\" he says of Lillestrom. \"We had to halve the costs. I suppose my biggest achievement as manager was making more money for the owners than we spent.\"</p> <p>Concern at Venky's running of Blackburn was not eased by the five weeks it took to appoint Kean's successor. Berg was one of five names on a list eventually compiled by Singh, the managing director Derek Shaw and the press officer turned general manager Paul Agnew after failing to secure Tim Sherwood's release from Tottenham Hotspur. Harry Redknapp, Ian Holloway, Gus Poyet and Huddersfield's Simon Grayson were the others, although Poyet was reluctant to leave Brighton and talks with Redknapp's representatives broke down. Diego Maradona was even linked at one point. \"Come on,\" said Singh to that invented tale. \"He wouldn't want to consider us even if we were interested.\"</p> <p>As for Redknapp, Singh added: \"It was important to meet Harry's representatives and to tell them where we were coming from and where the speculation was coming from because sometimes that can be very detrimental. In no way the club wanted to be in a situation where we upset Harry by what was said in the media. We had a very constructive discussion and we move on.\"</p> <p>Singh insisted a thorough managerial search was required to guarantee there was no repeat of the mistake with Kean. Singh's explanation of how they ultimately arrived at Berg, however, did not suggest that he was an early frontrunner.</p> <p>Singh, who claimed a legal dispute over the manner of Kean's exit had been resolved, said: \"We looked at three different categories. We looked at the wise old head; the senior men, then we looked at the middle group; who have been in management enough, who have tasted success and failure, and then we looked at the third group; the young, vibrant, dynamic modern-thinking manager who could possibly be the next best thing. I think that is no different from what most top clubs in the world do.</p> <p>\"I always cite Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as an example. In 2002, Porto said 'you are the man.' AVB [Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas] in 2010, J\u00fcrgen Klopp in Borussia Dortmund in 2008, so that was the third category. I think we have found a manager in Henning who is in the middle group and is also in the third group, so we have got a mixture of both.\"</p>",
  "<p>New York City's mayor Michael Bloomberg took climate change out of the closet on Thursday by invoking the issue in his endorsement of Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"This November, vote for a president who will lead on climate change,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikeBloomberg/status/264080226886221824\">Bloomberg wrote on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>The stunning snub to Mitt Romney, in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, at a stroke turned climate change from liability into a potentially winning political issue in this presidential election.</p> <p>It might even embolden other Republicans, who do support action on climate change, to come out of the closet as well. At least, that seems to be partly Bloomberg's intention.</p> <p>The real test of power will be whether Obama makes climate change part of his standard stump speech \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">something that has been notably lacking so far</a> \u2013 and whether Republicans dare to admit a connection between Sandy and climate change.</p> <p>Obama, in his response to the endorsement, relegated climate change to a lesser item on his list. For Bloomberg it was the focal point as a result of the disaster that has struck his city.</p> <p>\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of next Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" Bloomberg wrote. \"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it may be \u2014 given the devastation it is wreaking \u2014 should be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"</p> <p>Businessweek, which is owned by Bloomberg, made the point even more trenchantly with a cover reading: \"It's global warming, stupid.\"</p> <p>But Bloomberg made a point of rebuking Romney for abandoning his own record on climate change, as governor of Massachusetts, in an effort to win over conservative Republicans. The New York mayor also praises Obama for his efforts on climate change in the White House.</p> <p>\"Over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks,\" Bloomberg said.</p> <p>The mayor went on to invoke the administration's moves to clean up coal-fired power plants \u2013 which have been vigorously opposed by Republicans \u2013 before citing his own efforts on climate change.</p> <p>Then comes the swipe at the Republican contender. \"Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change \u2026 He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course.\"</p> <p>In the aftermath of Sandy, a number of Democrats including Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and New York's governor Andrew Cuomo have begun talking publicly about climate change.</p> <p>The mention comes after an election season in which climate change has been strangely absent \u2013 to the frustration of campaigners and the bewilderment of European observers.</p> <p>For Obama, the silence was strategic. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/01/obama-strategy-silence-climate-change\">The White House saw climate change as a vulnerability for Obama</a>.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's most prominent mention of climate change was as a laugh line in his convention speech \u2013 an attempt to win over conservative Republicans.</p> <p>The Tea Party movement has turned climate denial into a litmus test of conservative credentials \u2013 and that has made climate change one of the most sharp divisions between Obama and Romney.</p> <p>But even Republicans who accept climate science are opposed to the kind of sweeping economic transformation required to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming.</p> <p>George Pataki, the former governor of New York, argued it was the Democrats' focus on big solutions to climate change had set Republicans on edge. \"Part of it is a reaction to the stridency of some of the activists who really are looking to expand government power,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Obama's policies on climate change amounted to a \"massive power grab\".</p> <p>\"This president and his administration supported the Waxman-Markey bill that was horribly flawed \u2013 one more aimed at expanding government control over industry, generated government revenue, and extending favours to friends than at dealing with climate change.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Serious Fraud Office made \"irregular\" pension and severance payments of \u00a3422,000 to its former chief executive that cannot be clawed back, the National Audit Office has found.</p> <p>As a result, the public spending watchdog has qualified the SFO's accounts for 2011-12, which means they have not been approved as showing that money was spent in the way parliament intended.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the public accounts committee, has condemned what she called the \"sweetheart deal\" between the SFO and its former executive.</p> <p>Phillippa Williamson took voluntary redundancy in April and was paid \u00a3407,000 to cover any pension costs arising from early departure. The SFO \u2013 an independent government department charged with investigating and prosecuting serious or complex fraud and corruption \u2013 failed to gain approval from the Cabinet Office for this payment.</p> <p>There is also no evidence that it sought Treasury approval, as required, for a special severance payment of \u00a315,000. Both payments have been deemed irregular by the NAO. Further, it found no evidence due process was followed in instigating the voluntary redundancy \u2013 for example, in relation to whether alternative positions within the civil service were sought.</p> <p>Williamson, who along with her boss, director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/29/serious-fraud-office-humiliation-battle-vincent-tchenguiz\" title=\"\">Richard Alderman, bungled an inquiry into property developers the Tchenguiz brothers</a>, followed him out of the door soon after he was forced to issue a humiliating apology and step down at the end of his contract.</p> <p>Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: \"By failing to seek approval from the Cabinet Office and the Treasury, the Serious Fraud Office entered into an agreement which forced it to make irregular payments. While positive steps have been taken by the incoming director, I have qualified the organisation's accounts.\"</p> <p>The SFO's new director, David Green, sought legal advice on taking office that confirmed Williamson's agreement was legally binding. He has commissioned an independent review into the matter and has taken steps to ensure that all future exit packages are appropriately reviewed, the NAO said.</p> <p>The SFO said Green notified the NAO of his decision not to seek retrospective approval from the Treasury of what he considered \"unjustified expenditure\".</p> <p>Hodge said she was astonished to discover the SFO's former chief executive was given a special severance payment, at a time of sharp cuts in public spending which are affecting essential services. She said the CEO and the SFO sealed the terms of this \"sweetheart deal\" outside official Treasury procedures, and deplored the fact that the SFO was unable to claw back the money.</p> <p>\"The SFO showed a total disregard for taxpayers' money when they wrote out a five-figure cheque to the CEO and failed to provide valid justification for the payment,\" said Hodge.</p> <p>\"The SFO also ignored Cabinet Office rules when signing off \u00a3407,000 worth of pension entitlements. My committee will want to see an immediate stop to unacceptable payments of this kind.\"</p> <p>Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, said: \"This is jaw-dropping. We cannot have irregular payments being made inside what is supposed to be the country's leading fraud investigator.</p> <p>\"This comes hot on the heels of a string of high profile blunders, such as the botched probe into the Tchenguiz brothers. Since this government took office, the SFO has been haemorrhaging staff, so we need to establish that this is an isolated incident. The SFO faces budget cuts of more than 25% this parliament and can ill-afford squandering half a million on appalling decisions like this.\"</p> <p>The SFO said: \"The present director David Green took up post on 21 April 2012. Upon learning of the exit terms he asked Treasury solicitors to conduct a full independent inquiry. He took legal advice as to the enforceability of the agreement and notified the National Audit Office of his decision not to seek retrospective approval from HM Treasury of what he considered unjustified expenditure.\"</p>",
  "<p>'It was just going to be a party label. We didn't take it too seriously,\" says <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Piller\" title=\"\">Eddie Piller</a>. His cockney tones a little frayed after a soul weekender at the Ambassador Suite in Bournemouth, the clubland veteran and DJ is contemplating the remarkable feat of keeping an independent record label alive for a quarter of a century. And not just any label. Like 2 Tone before it, his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Jazz\" title=\"\">Acid Jazz</a> imprint \u2013&nbsp;25&nbsp;years old this year \u2013 became a genre of its own.</p> <p>The phrase \"acid jazz\" itself was a coined by Piller's partner at the birth of the label, <a href=\"http://www.gillespetersonworldwide.com/\" title=\"\">Gilles Peterson</a>. These days a globe-trotting musical tastemaker with his own show on BBC 6 Music, Peterson was the driving creative force behind a scene that sprang up in the late 80s, just as acid house was taking off. It had its roots in classic jazz, but shared acid house's energy \u2013 hence the slightly arch \"acid jazz\" tag. But while the pounding house sound sat naturally in the main arena, Peterson and Piller's was always happiest in the back room.</p> <p>\"Gilles and I realised in 1987 that there was a growing crowd around our two club nights: Monday at the Wag in Soho, and Dingwalls in Camden on Sunday afternoons,\" says Piller. \"And among that crowd were musicians who had something to say. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/9b8d6e2c-2b4e-4924-82ae-226b4e701f6b\" title=\"\">Brand New Heavies</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/95495d6a-c1f2-4a62-b0e3-b9c5f2e9dea6\" title=\"\">James Taylor Quartet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/f4857fb9-e255-4dc6-bd01-e4ca7cc68544\" title=\"\">Jamiroquai</a> \u2013 they all came out of that group of about 250 people.\"</p> <p>The label's first release, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZwdyuPqHg0\" title=\"\">Frederick Lies Still</a>, featured Peterson's flatmate reciting poetry over an obscure instrumental track. But Piller's roots were in mod culture \u2013 his mother ran the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/7771a68c-ef6a-400f-978d-64050d45a54c\" title=\"\">Small Faces</a> fan club when he was growing up \u2013 and so lost gems, unearthed from the past, were also a key element. What really caused sparks to fly was when the two men combined new and old to curate a series of influential compilation albums.</p> <p>\"We did the first <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Totally-Wired-Illicit-Grooves-Acid/dp/B000VZPPX6\" title=\"\">Totally Wired</a> compilation in 1988,\" says Piller. \"No one had ever tried to create an album of past and present that you could put on at a party and just leave on and every track gets played. That's where our interest in licensing oldies came from. The major labels wouldn't license their tracks to independents like us. So to get permission, to use them we had to track down the artists themselves. The detective work made it a bit more exciting.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/27940835?badge=0\"> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/27940835?badge=0\" width=\"460\" height=\"340\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/27940835\">The story of Acid Jazz, as told in a previously never aired film</a></p> </figure>  <p>That hunting eventually saw Piller reignite the career of Terry Callier, the Chicago singer who died this week. By that point, Peterson had left Acid Jazz to set up a label of his own, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkin%27_Loud\" title=\"\">Talkin' Loud</a>. \"It gave me a free hand to do more of what I wanted,\" Piller says. \"Me and Gilles had brilliant chemistry, but we didn't really agree on what we wanted to release. So I thought, 'Well I'm going to have to make some kind of a splash now, cos Talkin' Loud's got massive budgets.\"</p> <p>Piller's pursuit of Callier gave Acid Jazz the hit he was looking for in the rereleased <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0YwWU5wdEo\" title=\"\">I Don't Want to See Myself (Without You)</a>, and in turn brought to a wider audience a man whose talents never failed to touch those who heard him perform. \"Terry was the most spiritual person I'd ever come across,\" says Piller. \"Very quiet, shy, humble. He had not had a good time in music, but once he came to the UK and saw the passion and obsession that British kids had for him \u2013 which he had no idea about, like so many black Americans who come here to perform totally unaware that they are cultural icons \u2013 it blew him away.</p> <p>\"He was very grateful to me, and I really don't think I deserved it. Even two years ago I was reading interviews where he thanked me for digging him out of a life of computer programming at Chicago University. No one else has ever thanked me, and I've made quite a few people millionaires!\"</p> <p>Back at the post-Peterson Acid&nbsp;Jazz label, Piller's millionaire in the making was Jay Kay, the young west Londoner soon to be Jamiroquai. \"It's one of the things I'm proudest of,\" says Piller, who signed him in 1992 for the debut single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo7iwlMFPrM\" title=\"\">When You Gonna Learn?</a>. \"Discovering a kid like Jamiroquai, who was constantly turned down when I&nbsp;tried to take him to major labels.\"</p> <p>Eventually Sony saw a future in his protege, and gave him a contract. \"I&nbsp;did make money out of him,\" Piller adds. \"We had his publishing rights. But I sold him, because I couldn't afford his recording style and techniques. That first single cost 37 grand \u2013 and at the time I was still working out of two rooms. But Jamiroquai paid for the Blue Note, which is the other thing I'm most proud of.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8314v7RN6g\" title=\"\">Blue Note</a> was the club Piller opened in 1993 in Hoxton Square, at the time an almost entirely forgotten part of London. \"I purchased a derelict jazz club called the Bass Clef from a receiver for 220 grand. My dad, who is a bookmaker and grew up a hundred yards from Hoxton Square, said, 'Son \u2013 you do not want to be owning a night club in Hoxton. It's a dark, dangerous place. You're in the heart of the gangster territory. People will be asking for protection money.' There were almost no other businesses there. One pub, one sandwich shop and a gay club called The London Apprentice. Everyone said we were mad.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7wSYlaEZJa6IVlDyMqlcSf\"> <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7wSYlaEZJa6IVlDyMqlcSf\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"340\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Nonetheless, the DJs at Piller's new club were soon beginning to persuade people to venture east for a night out. \"I approached the club in the same way that I approached the record label. Each night had to be different, but run by the best people for the job. So the best drum'n'bass night would be Goldie and Metalheadz; the best breakbeat night would be Coldcut or James Lavelle; the best dub night would be Aba Shanti. It took a few months for people to get their heads around going to that part of London \u2013 Shoreditch, as it's now called \u2013 and staying out until 5am, but eventually it was full seven nights a week.\"</p> <p>It's no exaggeration to say the success of the Blue Note was a key factor in the great turning toward the east that has characterised the capital in the past 20 years. That shift has in turn been at the heart of its reinvigorated status as a global creative centre, with the triumphant Olympics and all that has followed. Piller laughs at the memory of it all: \"I was consulted by politicians about how to relaunch bereft areas through the night-time economy. I wrote a paper for the Lib Dems at one stage. Obviously they didn't take any notice, but there you go \u2026</p> <p>\"Once creative people move into a derelict area, then you get gentrification. The council changed, gentrified the area, and the newcomers didn't want 200 people queuing outside the Blue Note seven nights a week. They changed a bylaw so that my half of the square became a residential area, and I had to close the club at 11pm. We couldn't appeal, so that was the end of it. I sold it to a developer, and tried to relocate it to Islington. But I chose the wrong partners, and in the end I decided to leave it as a happy memory, and I got back on with running Acid Jazz.\" Piller now has curated a new boxset that commemorates the label's 25 years and tries to put into context all the complex and diverse musical influences \u2013 from house to hip-hop, bossa nova to funk \u2013 that made up the acid jazz scene. But it is undoubtedly Peterson who has really taken forward its eclecticism and kept its flame alive. I ask him what he made of it.</p> <p>\"I'm proud and delighted about that time,\" he says. \"We put out some great records. What Eddie did with Jamiroquai \u2013 setting up a huge artist \u2013 was fantastic. And the Blue Note was massively influential. But from my point of view, acid jazz had its time. In the end, it got taken over by the marketing people \u2013 people with no taste or politics. It became a very easy, lazy way of marketing jazz. It was a shame, because I met a lot of people of the Clash generation \u2013 the last generation that really got involved with music and politics \u2013 who really believed in the movement that was coming out of acid jazz. It was a real shame that nothing more substantial was made from it. But maybe that's a whole other story. I just want to be positive for Eddie and the label, because they've maintained, they've kept at it. And he deserves total respect for that.\"</p> <p>For Piller, the triumph is in continuing to put out music. He has a new young Manchester act on his books, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM3XTy7B0qI\" title=\"\">the Janice Graham Band</a>, which he calls the most exciting since Jamiroquai. \"I was never that money-minded,\" he says. \"Acid Jazz has sometimes been really successful, sometimes things have been really tight. That's the nature of an independent label: you are at the mercy of the market, but you don't have the cushion of a catalogue that the major labels have. But now we have a catalogue, of about three or four thousand titles. We've released about 600 records in 25 years \u2013 that's quite a lot for an indie.</p> <p>\"We didn't plan any of this. We had quite a bad time from 2000-2008. People weren't interested. And so to deal with the unfashionableness, we just retreated back underground and went back to releasing records. And it took us seven eight years of being really unfashionable. But each time I thought about walking away and doing something else, I thought, 'I love my catalogue! I love what I've done! Why would I want to give up?' So we just carried on putting out music with a small team. And eventually you come up with something cool, and people say, 'Oh,&nbsp;they're still going. Great!'\"</p>",
  "<p>You can smash a building, bomb a city, impoverish a nation and the world grants you a hearing. But break the twig of a British tree and hobgoblins will descend and destroy you. Thank goodness for that.</p> <p>Britain this autumn is ablaze. The year's eccentric climate has given us dying leaves of unprecedented splendour. Researching a book on English landscape, I travelled last week through the Midlands to the Peak District and the Yorkshire Dales. The golden beechwoods of the Chilterns gave way to the yellows and oranges of Cannock Chase, the purples of the Peak District and the ambers of the Calder, the Aire and the southern dales. England was never so beautiful. If the coalition is now presiding over the last rites of the open English countryside, it has at least granted it the loveliest of funerals.</p> <p>The climax of my journey was a question posed by a Guardian reader. Which is the finer view, he asked: from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanage_Edge\" title=\"\">Stanage Edge</a> in the High Peak west towards <a href=\"http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/mam-tor\" title=\"\">Mam Tor</a>, or from Mam Tor east to Stanage Edge? From each vantage point, black snow clouds dodged bright sun. Swirling light and shadow turned Hope Valley into a set for a Tolkien novel. The scene was of nature untrammelled, a palette of brilliant colours with hardly a sight of human habitation. The view from Mam Tor won.</p> <p>How soon before these colours are&#xa0;gone and the horizon is lined with turbines, as now is the Peak's northern rim, promoted unbelievably by the same&#xa0;Nick Clegg whose Sheffield constituency borders this paradise? During the last war artists such as John Piper and Sir William Russell Flint were&#xa0;commissioned by Whitehall to depict buildings at risk from bombing, creating the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/recording-britain-collection/\" title=\"\">Recording Britain archive</a>. A&#xa0;similar record is now urgently needed of the landscape.</p> <p>In the news this week were two new threats to add to the government's renewed eagerness to build in the country rather than towns. The first is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/28/ash-dieback-fungus-change-countryside?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">fungal disease threatening ash</a>, and possibly others affecting larch and chestnut. The second is confusion over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/coalition-wind-farm-dispute-renewables\" title=\"\">coalition's plan for onshore turbines</a> to rise from some 3,000 today to 7,000-plus by the end of the decade. This constitutes nothing less than the mass industrialisation of the landscape.</p> <p>The threat of ash dieback is mitigated by the vigour with which new trees regenerate in the British climate. The losses of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2007/oct/10/conservation\" title=\"\">great storm of 1987</a>, heart-breaking at the time, have been more than made good. Anyone must regret the loss of the ash, a serenely delicate adornment of woods and hedges, especially in favour of such bruisers as sycamore and poplar. But I am told ash does revive, unlike elm.</p> <p>Trees also benefit from public affection. The wider countryside enjoys no such iconic status. In the recent debate over planning reforms developers were able to persuade ministers to favour rural against urban building, entirely because rural building was more profitable. Countryside was considered to have no intrinsic planning virtue outside the 15% of land designated as national park or natural beauty reserve. The concept did not arise.</p> <p>Against windfarms there is not even&#xa0;that defence. They can go anywhere an inspector or a minister decides. Nowhere in Whitehall guidance on turbines is there any reference to natural or visual beauty. This is no surprise to a sector now drunk on public subsidy, but even its opponents feel they must avoid any reference to aesthetics. They talk of wind power's cost and intermittency, its abuse of peat and extravagance of imported minerals, its forcing poor energy users to cross-subsidise rich landowners.</p> <p>This week the energy minister <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/9644558/Death-knell-for-wind-farms-Enough-is-Enough-says-minister.html#\" title=\"\">John Hayes upset David Cameron</a> by saying what he thought was Cameron's view, attacking turbines not for their intrusion but for offending local opinion. Where does that leave the turbines strung across Oxfordshire's Vale of White Horse? They have wrecked the finest view in Thames Valley.</p> <p>A modern nation claiming some visual sensitivity would not build such colossal structures as now stride, or are about to stride, along the Northumbrian coast and across the Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales, Snowdonia and the Cambrian mountains. Cornwall intends to saddle its visitors with a proposed 490 turbines, carpeting its fragile landscape. An astonishing wall of 279 turbines is about to rise smack down the middle of the Bristol Channel.</p> <p>If that view is not sacred, what of Hampstead Heath or the white cliffs of Dover? This industry has no shame. Yet as Oxford University's <a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dieter Helm says in his new book, The Carbon Crunch</a>, the impact of this desecration on actual global warming is trivial.</p> <p>The truth is we have lost the words to define or discuss the beauty of the landscape. We assume it is \"anti-growth\" and therefore a social cost, because green lobbyists say so to justify their subsidies. Whitehall maps each wind farm not as energy generated (let alone carbon saved) but as jobs temporarily created, as if it were a Trident submarine. The debate has become enslaved to the irrational logic of an inherited folly.</p> <p>The coalition government's visual legacy may yet be a British landscape littered with the carcasses of dying trees and great waving semaphores, their arms dipping into everlasting vats of public money. If so, it will be because no one dared utter the word beauty, for fear of being thought a wimp. See Mam Tor before it is too late.</p>",
  "<p>\"I'd love to say I had a genius plan but the whole thing was a fluke,\" says Timfy James, guitarist and founder member of the band Hacktivist. Ostensibly exponents of <a href=\"http://got-djent.com/\" title=\"\">djent</a> \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/03/djent-metal-geeks\" title=\"\">complex, technically formidable form of heavy music</a> \u2013 the young five-piece from the Milton Keynes suburb of Wolverton combine thunderous riffs and quick-fire grime rhyming in a fashion poised to take this obscure scene overground. But as James tells it, their genre cross-pollination came about almost by accident.</p> <p>\"I was recording some grime stuff with my friend J Hurley, who's been an MC for years,\" James<strong> </strong>says, looking every inch the surly hardcore archetype with his asymmetrical haircut and box-fresh skate gear. \"One day I was tinkering around with this metal track and he really liked it and asked if he could try some lyrics on it. I just thought: 'Why not?' We put it up on Soundcloud and it just took off from there. The rest of it is a blur.

They have a frontman who comes from the grime scene and knows nothing about the metal scene at all. It all seems very real&#xa0;as a result and it's not contrived. It&#xa0;just works.\"</p> <p>Although Hacktivist represent the cutting edge of djent, several other bands are also making waves: Reading's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4h0rlWX5lM\" title=\"\">TesseracT</a>, named best new band at the recent <a href=\"http://www.progrockmag.com/tag/progressive-music-awards/\" title=\"\">Progressive Music awards</a>, as well as US six-piece <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pskj9sbffg\" title=\"\">Periphery</a> and London-based <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7m3K7IrBiE\" title=\"\">Monuments</a> (both of whom tour Europe and the UK this autumn). Thanks to an extraordinary level of international support that has evolved almost entirely online, djent has been growing steadily for several years away from the mainstream. Visit the forums on websites such as <a href=\"http://got-djent.com/\" title=\"\">got-djent.com</a> and witness fans from Europe, the US and Australia expressing their fanatical support for the genre. In fact, there are obvious parallels with the dubstep scene. Djent is created primarily by suburban nerds with laptops using state-of-the-art music software that is then used to power and control live&#xa0;performances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/255364/vidId=1495075&amp;la=n\"> <object width=\"640\" height=\"366\" id=\"muzuplayer-255364\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/255364/vidId=1495075&la=n\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://player.muzu.tv/player/getPlayer/a/255364/vidId=1495075&la=n\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"283\" name=\"muzuplayer-255364\"></embed></object><br /><a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/periphery-emi/make-total-destroy-music-video/1495075/\">Periphery - Make Total Destroy</a> on <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/\">MUZU.TV</a>. </figure>  <p>Reading this on mobile? <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/periphery-emi/make-total-destroy-music-video/1495075/#\">Click here to view</a><br>\"Djent is definitely metal but if you listen to dubstep, our music is around the same tempo, with the same syncopated rhythms,\" says James, who at 24 speaks with the assurance of a veteran. \"I love dubstep, hip-hop and drum'n'bass and I use a lot of that ambience in our stuff. We're uniting a lot of people. People have said, 'I've never listened to metal before but you make it speak to me,' and others have said, 'I really hate hip-hop but I love what you're doing.' That's really&#xa0;exciting.\"</p> <p>The creation of djent is usual attributed to maverick Swedish metal band <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/cf8b3b8c-118e-4136-8d1d-c37091173413\" title=\"\">Meshuggah</a>, who established their blend of bewildering polyrhythms and intricate riffs in the early 90s and continue to confound conservative fans of heavy music today. But this new generation is taking that blueprint and gleefully mixing it up with anything that strays on to their radar, regardless of how it might polarise&#xa0;opinion.</p> <p>\"There are people from the dance arena who see Hacktivist as something with similar crossover potential to something like the Prodigy,\" says Phillips, exuding fatherly pride for the scene his label has nurtured. \"They're pricking up ears outside of the metal world and that speaks volumes.\"</p> <p>Several labels are currently buzzing around Hacktivist, sensing that something remarkable is happening. It certainly helps that the band's live performances have more in common with a low-key grime or hip-hop gig than a bright and blustery metal show. Shrouded in darkness and dressed in hoodies or black skate wear, the quintet exude an air of menace that fits perfectly with their gritty, urban sound. Frankly, you wouldn't mess with them even before the monstrous riffs and ultra-precise beats kick in. Hurley's lyrics combine braggadocio and rebellious sloganeering with an underlying sense of bleak urban unease. \"Volcanoes erupt from beneath,\" he barks on Cold Shoulders, \"as we stand here gritting our teeth \u2026\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F62297220&amp;show_artwork=true\"> <iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F62297220&show_artwork=true\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>With a self-titled debut EP released on 12 November to coincide with <a href=\"http://www.songkick.com/artists/5691769-hacktivist\" title=\"\">a first headlining tour of the UK</a>, the band are eager to maintain their independence. But it's not hard to imagine a future where this forward-thinking music gatecrashes the mainstream.</p> <p>\"Djent is evolved music,\" says John Browne, guitarist with Monuments. \"If you listen to the pop charts you just hear Michael Jackson over and over again. But with this, it's not a blatant copy of anything. It's taking elements of great things and making them into something that's new and hopefully great, too. It's just the evolution of more complex music and it really seems to connect with people.\"</p> <p>\"This scene proves that people can do what the hell they want and reach the other side of the planet without big labels interfering,\" James says. \"People are doing it on their own. It's&#xa0;just a new way of making music. I can make up a band name, put some songs up on Soundcloud and YouTube, and if it's got the right spark it'll go global.\"</p>",

After dropping to 7.8% last month, any rise could dominate the final days of the campaign, tilting what remains of the tiny group of undecided voters towards Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Romney, who resumed campaigning day earlier, made the economy and unemployment a big part of his final pitch. \"If the president were to be re-elected, we're going to see high levels of unemployment continue,\" he said.</p> <p>An Obama spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, asked about the figures yesterday, said: \"Regardless what they are, the president is going to feel there's more we need to do to help people get back to work.\"</p> <p>The Obama team is hoping that any poor unemployment figures will be more than compensated for by the plaudits Obama has won this week for his handling of Sandy.</p> <p>The president, looking more confident and with more vigour than he has throughout most of the campaign, told a small crowd gathered near the steps of Air Force One at an airport in Green Bay that America had been inspired by what it had witnessed this week.</p> <p>\"All the petty differences that consume us in normal times all seem to melt away. There are no Democrats or Republicans during a storm, there are just fellow Americans,\" the president said.</p> <p>The line is a reprise of the plea for bipartisan cooperation that saw him rise to national prominence after a speech to the Democratic convention in 2004 and that he used repeatedly in the 2008 campaign.</p> <p>\"Leaders of different parties working to fix what's broken. neighbours helping neighbours cope with tragedy; communities rallying to rebuild; a spirit that says, in the end, we're all in this together -\u2013 that we rise or fall as one nation, as one people.\"</p> <p>Both the Obama and Romney campaigns claim they are winning. National polls show the two tied but of 11 polls published yesterday/Thurs in the eight swing states that will decide the election Obama is ahead in eight, Romney in two and the other a dead heat.</p> <p>The election could hinge on Ohio, a volatile and unpredictable state in which Obama holds a small lead, up two points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls.</p> <p>The Republican challenger enjoyed a surge in support after his success against Obama in the first of the presidential debates on October 3, regularly attracting crowds of 10,000 or more, but in the aftermath of Sandy these have dropped away. The crowd at his first event in Virginia yesterday attracted fewer than 3,000.</p> <p>Some Republicans are rehearsing excuses if they lose, such as blaming Sandy.</p> <p>The former Republican governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, emailed Politico to say: \"One thing is obvious \u2013 for a period of three days or more, nobody on the news media was reporting anything about the economy or job, spending, deficits or debts. And that's the Obama campaign's dream.\"</p> <p>In Green Bay, Obama shifted quickly from talking about Sandy to making his closing argument, a reprise of the stump speech he had been giving before Sandy.</p> <p>He described Romney as \"using all his talents as a salesman\" in trying to sell the same policies of George W Bush that had created the economic mess and that he would rubberstamp Tea Party policies.</p> <p>Obama's bipartisanship message is aimed not just at independents but Congress, hoping that a victory for him might persuade Republicans who control the House to cooperate in working out a deal in the face of an impending economic crisis.</p> <p>Although the White House is careful to avoid any accusations of complacency, work is underway on post-election priorities. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, briefing reporters, refused to discuss specifics beyond saying that the administration is always working on budget issues. The big problem looming is a face-off with Congress over tackling the 'fiscal cliff', major spending cuts to reduce the burgeoning deficit.</p> <p>\"The president has said and believes that after the election we will be able to come together in a bipartisan way to resolve these issues and to deal with our deficit and debt challenge with a balanced proposal that reflects an overwhelming consensus among experts and the American people about how we should get this done. And he looks forward to tackling those issues after the election,\" Carney said.</p> <p>Romney, in his first speech of the day in Virginia, stuck too to his stump speech, reprising an anecdotes about Boy Scouts, the song America the Beautiful and lines from a fictional football team in the show Friday Night Lights in which there was a rallying cry on the way out of the locker room: \"clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose\".

Some of those goals in some countries are expected to be achieved by the 2015 deadline; others definitely will not.</p> <p>This week's meetings \u2013 the first substantive discussions on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/31/post-2015-development-agenda-explained\" title=\"\">post-2015 development agenda</a> \u2013 focused on household poverty, both defining it and looking at ways to get households out of poverty. Describing this week's sessions as lively, constructive and productive, Cameron cited the importance of rights for women, a free press, the rule of law, an open society and an open economy \u2013 a combination amounting to what he described as the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204712904578090571423009066.html\" title=\"\">\"golden thread\" of development</a>.</p> <p>Cameron and his co-chairs, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the president of Indonesia, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/nov/02/liberia-johnson-sirleaf-women-politics-video\">Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf</a> (video), all emphasised the importance of listening to civil society, the private sector and young people, in an attempt to achieve the widest possible consensus for the follow-up to the MDGs.</p> <p>\"The goals we come up with are not handed down from rich to poor countries \u2026 they are not tablets of stone handed by the UN. We all have responsibilities,\" said the prime minister at a joint press conference with his co-chairs at Downing Street.</p> <p>Yudhoyono emphasised the importance of \"sustainable growth with equity\" amid a growing awareness among policy makers and development experts that economic growth alone is no guarantor of wellbeing and stability.</p> <p>\"We need to ensure that growth will be shared equally,\" he said.</p> <p>Johnson Sirleaf, speaking for a state slowly recovering after decades of bloody conflict, stressed the fundamental importance of peace and security to reduce the fragility and vulnerability of states. She said Africa \u2013 the new frontier \u2013 stood to gain much from a new development agenda.</p> <p>\"The global economic pie has the best opportunity to be widened,\" she said, with Africa benefiting from a bigger pie.</p> <p>With only 15 minutes, the three did not delve into any detail on what a post-2015 agenda would look like. The task of writing up a report by May will fall to 26 experts, with inequality expected to be a strong theme.</p> <p>A Save the Children report published on Wednesday said the gap between rich and poor is at its highest since the 1990s and is growing, with children hit hardest.</p> <p>Born Equal said in some countries, the gulf between the richest and poorest families has <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news-and-comment/news/2012-10/gap-between-rich-and-poorest-widest-nineties\" title=\"\">increased by up to 179% over the past two decades</a>. Moreover, the gap between rich and poor children has grown by 35% and in some countries more than twice the numbers of poor children die before the age of five than rich children.</p> <p>The charity calculated the household income per child in the top and bottom 10% of income scales in 32 countries.</p> <p>\"Unless inequality is addressed,\" said Justin Forsyth, Save the Children's chief executive. \"The MDGs and any future development framework will simply not succeed in maintaining or accelerating progress. What's more, it will hold individual countries \u2013 and the world \u2013 back from experiencing real growth and prosperity.\"</p> <p>The UN says a post-2015 framework will have at its core the continuing fight against poverty, climate change and sustainable development, while addressing inclusive growth, equality, peace and security, and human rights.</p>",
  "<p>Last weekend I invited one of my closest friends over for dinner. We chewed over the usual unremarkable topics: The X Factor, future plans, idle gossip, the new Bond film. And then the conversation turned to something less unremarkable; something most people will never talk about with their friends. What if none of the memories we share, the secrets we've told each other, or the histories we've disclosed to one another were real? What if everything we knew about each other was based on a lie, so that one of us could extract information from the other that would eventually be used against them? It was such a distressing thought that we changed the subject almost immediately.</p> <p>My friend is an activist. I know quite a lot of activists. I have been one for some time. I don't know any who have hurt another human being. I don't know any who are a danger to society. Most of the activists I know engage in the odd nonviolent demonstration, like the protesters at Fortnum &amp; Mason, some of whose guilty verdicts were overturned yesterday, or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">people halfway up West Burton power station</a>.</p> <p>Despite the peaceful nature of their actions, the simple act of protesting means that activists' lives sometimes resemble that of Tony Soprano. Surveillance, police intimidation and undercover officers are routine hazards they must negotiate. As one environmental campaigner who has come into contact with undercover officers puts it: \"You don't have to be self-important to suspect you're the victim of state surveillance. If you're politically active, it's simply a fact of life.\"</p> <p>Occasionally we read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robevans+uk/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans\" title=\"\">stories of undercover officers</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/04/sussex-police-criticised-harassment-protester-liaison\" title=\"\">police intimidating campaigners in their homes</a> or sending <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/08/met-accused-scare-protesters-letter\" title=\"\">threatening letters</a>; but rarely do we talk about the psychological toll this takes \u2013 that a feeling of constantly being watched is an invariable factor in the lives of people who take part in protest. Often activists are depicted as being like the mafia \u2013 part of an underground coterie that is somehow separated from ordinary life. It's a depiction that makes constant surveillance seem acceptable, perhaps even justified. But activists are just ordinary people who work, watch TV, and drink too much at the weekend, just like anybody else.</p> <p>After police unlawfully visited me at my home following a protest to tell me they were \"watching me\", I still jump every time my doorbell rings. More seriously, I have female friends who are reticent about relationships in case the men they are sleeping with are not who they say they are. One person whose campaign group was infiltrated told me the reason it often takes activists a while to spot undercover officers is denial. \"It's just too horrible to contemplate that every memory you've shared with that friend has been a lie,\" she said.</p> <p>Consistently being treated like a criminal, even when you're not doing anything illegal, excludes you from normal society \u2013 as though that's something you have to give up if you want to act on your political beliefs. The officers who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/21/hillsborough-investigation-extend-orgreave-miners\" title=\"\">allegedly fabricated evidence</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/police-violence-orgreave-miners-truth\" title=\"\">battle of Orgreave</a> or those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/undercover-with-paul-lewis-and-rob-evans/2012/oct/19/women-fighting-police-over-relationships-with-spies\" title=\"\">who slept with campaigners,</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/16/undercover-police-officers-lives-women?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">gain their trust,</a> have never been disciplined. The message is clear: if you participate in activism nothing is off limits and you're on your own.</p> <p>Last April the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8473880/Syria-William-Hague-condemns-crackdown.html\" title=\"\">foreign secretary, William Hague, called for Syria to</a> \"respect basic and universal human rights to freedoms of expression and assembly\". What does the intrusive surveillance of activists mean for a society that champions freedom of expression to the world? How can we justify extending the net of surveillance so widely, unsettling the lives of so many, and apparently for so little? The truth is that enduring this type of psychological harassment \u2013 for that's what it amounts to \u2013 is not the domain of paranoid fantasists or mobsters. It is a routine problem for anyone taking part in even the most innocuous forms of dissent.</p> <p>That conversation I had with my friend over dinner was not outlandish; it&#xa0;was almost a rite of passage. It is&#xa0;the&#xa0;sort of conversation that activists must expect to have in a society such as&#xa0;ours, which spies so relentlessly on&#xa0;its own citizens.</p>",
  "<p>In early summer, Abu Ismael, a six-year veteran of al-Qaida, left the insurgency still blazing in his homeland of Iraq and travelled to what he believes is the start of the apocalypse.</p> <p>He secured cash from a benefactor in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil, then approached a weapons dealer in Anbar province, a desolate corner of the country that was not long ago a staging point for jihadis arriving from Syria and is now a gateway for those going the other way.</p> <p>\"It was easy,\" he said, in the sitting room of a house in the Syrian city of Aleppo. \"The money was no problem, neither was the weapon, or the motivation. This will be a fight against the great enemy.\"</p> <p>Around the hard-bitten 23-year-old sat three members of a Syrian rebel militia who were acting as his hosts. They looked at the floor as the young jihadi explained Qur'anic teachings that he said were shaping the battle ahead. \"I don't care about the future,\" he said. \"I care about today. Muhammad the Messenger said there would be a battle between the Persians and the Sunnis. And it is coming.</p> <p>\"When the regime falls, all those who fought against the Muslims will be my enemy, especially the Shias,\" he said, reiterating a view held by some Sunni extremists that Shia are their biggest foes.</p> <p>The hosts shifted nervously, still avoiding eye contact. The stranger in their midst had sought refuge among them two months ago. Since then he had rented a house, won a ride to the battle zone whenever he wants and earned the support of some of the area's rebel units.</p> <p>He has even won a more coveted prize: the right to marry the daughter of one of the fighter's cousins, a union that took place on Thursday with the qualified blessing of residents and clerics.</p> <p>Not everyone in the unit was happy with the wedding. \"It's you scratch my back, I scratch yours,\" said one young rebel, Abu Saif. \"He's a Salafi, there is no doubt about that,\" he added, referring to the ultra-fundamentalist school of Qur'anic thinking. \"And he doesn't represent what we believe.\"</p> <p>Remonstrating with the unnamed young girl's uncle sitting nearby, Abu Saif said: \"You tell me what benefit we get from him, or that your family gets.\" The uncle shrugged, offering no reply.</p> <p>As Syria's civil war grinds inexorably on, it is becoming as much a clash of ideologies as a battle of military will. The frontlines that were hurriedly carved out of Aleppo's ancient stone heart and concrete suburbs during the heady days of summer now seem almost secondary in the contest to determine the type of society that will one day rise from the ruins.</p> <p>For the most part, the opposition movement is staying true to the ethos that led many of the country's towns and citizens to mount a challenge to President Bashar al-Assad's absolute state control over their lives. But around the fringes, there are signs that the revolution's original values are starting to fray. The narrative of a defiant street versus a draconian state, so simple in March 2011, is now far more complicated.</p> <p>\"We want just what they got in Tunis and Egypt,\" said Mahmoud Razak, a shop-keeper in the outer suburbs. \"Freedom and the chance to progress in life. But we thought it would take 19 days like it took [in Egypt]. It's now 19 months. We didn't know it would be this difficult.\"</p> <p>To those now hosting Abu Ismael, the Iraqi jihadi embodies one of the major problems. Though for the most part conservative and pious, the men of this part of Aleppo refuse to see the crisis now consuming Syria in existential terms. To them, this is still a fight for self-determination, not the forum for an apocalyptic showdown with a preordained foe.</p> <p>\"What is this global jihad that he talks about?\" asked a town elder, Abu Abdullah, after the Iraqi had left to prepare for his wedding. \"We will be used as toys by them, just as the Sunni communities were in Iraq. When they have had their way with us they will demand that we return to the seventh century under the blade of a sword.\"</p> <p>Abu Ismael made no secret of his wish for Syria to be the heartland of an al-Qaida-led renaissance. Nor, unusually, did he hide what he had done in Iraq, or what he planned to do in the new war. In a candid hour-long discussion, he offered a rare insight into the terror group's designs on Syria and the organisation's fraught battle to assert itself. \"I was a member of the al-Qaida organisation from 2005-11,\" he said, his black eyes set in an unflinching stare. \"I joined them with my father when I was 16 and apart from one and a half months in prison, I was very active in every way.\"</p> <p>The young Iraqi's attire and demeanour were unmistakably those of a Salafi. He refused cigarettes, cuffed the bottoms of his fatigues at ankle level and wore a black skull cap over closely cropped black hair. More instructively, he spoke with derision about Shia Muslims, whom he said were increasingly travelling to Syria to fight the Sunni-led opposition.</p> <p>\"They are saying they are going to protect the Sit Zeinab mosque in Damascus,\" he said of a shrine revered by Shias. \"The Jaish al-Mahdi [Mahdi army] and Hezbollah are just using that as cover to enter the rest of Syria. We will not let them. We will attack it, perhaps not to destroy it, but to drive them out.</p> <p>\"There are around 50 Iraqis in each area of northern Syria. Perhaps more. It was not difficult to get here and it is not hard to find other mujahideen. We can fight where we want to and when we want to. And God willing we will prevail.\"</p> <p>His restless hosts were not so sure. Bound by social customs that offer wayfarers shelter and hospitality, this rebel unit seemed to sense that trouble is brewing between them and the growing band of global jihadis. Many rebel groups the Guardian spoke to this week said a showdown was looming with the new arrivals.</p> <p>\"I give it six months,\" said one rebel officer at a checkpoint in the old market place in the central Aleppo suburb of Midan on Thursday. \"Maybe a year,\" said another. \"I was in Iraq fighting the Americans and I saw how they changed once they sensed they had power.\"</p> <p>\"It's so mixed up,\" said a third young rebel, a defector from Damascus. \"And this is just how Bashar wants it.\"</p> <h2>Rise of the Salafis</h2> <p>Bashar al-Assad has insisted from the start that Syria was facing attack by \"armed terrorist gangs\", not a popular uprising \u2013 though there is ample evidence of the army firing on mostly unarmed demonstrators. But it has become clear that extremist Salafi or jihadi groups, some linked to al-Qaida, are now a significant element of the armed opposition.</p> <p>Alongside fighters from al-Qaida in Iraq or Fatah al-Islam from Lebanon is the mysterious Jabhat al-Nusra, which has claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Damascus and Aleppo. It is sympathetic to al-Qaida. Others hail from Jordan, Libya and Algeria.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of jihadis are Syrian, with the number of foreigners ranging from 1,200 to 1,500 members. Jihadi groups in Syria represent less than 10% of all fighters. Still, many have combat experience in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Libya and compete for funds and weapons with the Free Syrian Army, the main armed opposition group.</p> <p>\"Most foreign fighters go abroad to defend their fellow Muslim brethren from being slaughtered,\" according to Aaron Y Zelin, an analyst at the Washington Institute.</p> <p>\"Once in the area of battle, though, many come into closer contact with hardline jihadis, as well as fighters from other countries, and are exposed to new ideas.</p> <p>\"Therefore, portions of foreign fighters are not fighting to help establish a future state for Syrian nationals. Rather, they hope to annex it to be part of their grander aims of establishing emirates that will eventually lead to a re-established caliphate \u2013 however fanciful this project might be.\" <strong>Ian Black</strong></p>",

  "<p>The government's perma-shambles continues. Almost everything goes wrong. A new chief whip was greeted on Wednesday night with a crushing defeat after 53 Tories voted with Labour over Europe, ignoring their prime minister. And the minister for energy, a Conservative, is now completely at odds with the energy secretary, who is a Liberal Democrat.</p> <p>Clearly the secretary of state, Ed Davey, should be in charge. He told us that he was in charge. The minister of state, John Hayes, nominally his understrapper, had said there would be no more windfarms blighting our landscape. \"Enough is enough,\" was how he put it.</p> <p>Mr Davey believes there can never be enough windfarms. Only when, say, the entire Lake District is covered with the things, generating at peak periods enough electricity to power several toasters in the Penrith area, will he and the other Lib Dems be satisfied. I exaggerate, but not a great deal.</p> <p>For someone who had allegedly been given a bollocking by the boss, Mr Hayes looked remarkably pleased with himself. He resembled the schoolboy who, having been summoned to the headmaster for a caning, has remembered to wear his cast-iron Y-fronts.</p> <p>He had an air of casual insouciance, or as he put it \"What a pleasure it is to answer energy questions for the first time, and to do so with the wind in my sails.\" One of his joys is making life difficult for the Tories' coalition partners. Simon Hughes said the coalition agreement meant there could be no public subsidy for nuclear power. Mr Hayes was far too happy about the offer from Hitachi to provide us with nuclear power to let that one go. \"Let me be crystal clear,\" he said, using the politicians' term for \"let me obfuscate\". There would be no subsidy, \"unless similar support is provided more widely for other forms of generation\".</p> <p>In other words, the Tories were perfectly prepared to rip up the agreement. As they always are, when they can get away with it. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, complained. Mr Hayes said he would not be influenced by \"the preoccupations of bourgeois-left academics\". Who, presumably, are the only people concerned with the fate of the planet, in their horrible Marxist, middle-class, tree-hugging, beard-growing, Monbiot-reading way.</p> <p>Later, Mr Davey said he would be quite happy to listen to the views of bourgeois-left academics. Another coalition split! Mr Hayes was, by now, out of control. He praised himself for his clarity. He slapped himself on the back for the speed with which he acts.</p> <p>Mr Davey had the air of a man who couldn't take much more of this. Labour's Caroline Flint wanted to know if he and Mr Hayes were working together. Apparently they are. \"We may occasionally disagree on matters of substance \u2026 but I have to say that I really admire his style.\"</p> <p>And so does Mr Hayes. At last, they agree on something.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday, the October employment numbers will be revealed, and they are not expected to be particularly good. In four days, Americans will vote on a president.</p> <p>The connection of these two events cannot be ignored. The political punditry has widely speculated that no matter how the economy is going, voters will make their decision for a new president based on their views of the economy \u2013 that President Obama will have a harder time if the jobs numbers are bad, and Governor Mitt Romney may get a boost.</p> <p>This would be a mistaken way to cast a vote. In economics and psychology, there is a phenomenon known as \"recency bias,\" which we've all experienced even without knowing it: the most recent thing that happens seems to have the greatest effect on the future, whether it is actually important or not. For instance, if your brother-in-law borrows money and pays it back every time except the last one, it's the last time that will influence you to think that perhaps you would be unwise to lend money to your brother-in-law. In other words: our whole view of track records is skewed.</p> <p>So by election day, the most recent jobs report has a psychological impact that is pretty big, because it's the last thing about the economy we will remember as we go out to vote.</p> <p>There is little doubt that tomorrow's jobs report will be negative news, even if it adds jobs, as many expect. (Barclays, for instance, advised its banking clients to expect a modestly positive jobs report this week.)</p> <p>The news will be negative, no matter what, because the employment snapshot of America, as a whole, is so bleak. As University of Maryland professor Peter Morici pointed out in a report this week, \"the jobless rate has fallen mostly because 6 milion adults have chosen not to look for work. [Except] for this phenomenon, the unemployment rate would still be 9.7%. More than 8 million part time workers would like full time work but can't find it. Adding in those folks, the unemployment rate is 14.7%.\"</p> <p>What is remarkable is that the employment statistics stay stubbornly low while, elsewhere in the economy, there are signs that a true recovery may be stirring. Barclays analyst Pierro Ghezzi wrote a note this week titled \"Tentative Signs of a Recovery,\" which concluded: \"On balance, recent global economic releases have been stronger than expected, appearing to confirm that global economic activity is picking up, albeit modestly.\" He included the US in that estimation, saying that the economy was \"at a crossroads,\" but that there were positive signs of growth for the next three months.</p> <p>There are other economic indicators that give us a clearer view of the U.S. economy as a whole and how it's doing right now.</p> <p>These indicators tell us that the labor market is strengthening as productivity increases and workers pick up high-wage jobs as well as the low-wage ones; that consumers and businesses feel more optimistic; that they're looking to buy real estate and cars and going to banks for the money to borrow to make those purchases. They tell us that manufacturing - brought low earlier this year \u2013 is rebounding a bit; that personal income is increasing at the fastest pace in six months; that consumers are spending money in stores, resulting in better retail sales; and the housing market is strong enough that homebuilders are seeing their stocks rise and new home sales are rising fast.</p> <p>Of course, not everyone's in on this recovery surge. Businesses have been putting in lower orders for good. Other indicators also tell us that companies have been holding back in other ways this year, worried about issues like the fiscal cliff and the outcome of the election. The vastly different political implications of an Obama administration or a Romney one have caused some companies to hit the brakes until they decide how to proceed. Companies have not been growing their earnings like they used to. Peter Tchir, of TF Market Advisors, summed it up: \"Earnings suck. I was looking for a kinder word, but I think 'suck' works. Companies are missing the already lowered expectations and are almost universally less excited about next quarter.\"</p> <p>While that doesn't sound like good news \u2013 and it isn't, for those who own the stock of those companies \u2013 it does indicate, if you're an optimist, that there's lots of room for improvement. Tchir, for instance, pronounced himself reluctant to go \"bearish,\" or have a negative view on the economy. Barclays believes that economic growth will continue, and many other economists and analysts agree.</p> <p>The improvement in so many other economic indicators, while employment numbers remain dismal, may be an indication that the employment numbers don't really help us judge our current economy as well as we wish they would.</p> <p>Employment numbers are what is known as a lagging economic indicator, because they don't indicate how the economy is doing now; they indicate, at best, how it was doing, a month ago or even a few months ago. The reasoning for calling employment an lagging indicator is easy to understand: by the time people lose their jobs, things are already pretty bad. And when things start to pick up, jobs aren't the first sign that things are changing.</p> <p>It also doesn't help that the actual jobs and employment numbers are infamously vague and not tremendously informative. There are two main sources: the bureau of labor statistics, which is the much-watched government report, and payroll provider ADP, which is generally seen as a supplement to the BLS report but is taken less seriously. </p> <p>These numbers could make your head spin with their unreliability. ADP, for instance, released its employment report today. It said that in October, the economy added 158,000 jobs. That seems like good news, particularly because the prevailing expectation was for 135,000 jobs.</p> <p>But in that same report, ADP said that it had revised September's numbers, and they were much more disappointing than it had first thought.</p> <p>ADP said they were only 88,200 jobs added in September, after previously saying there were 162,000 jobs added. That's a big error.</p> <p>Similarly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says it can regularly be off the mark by 100,000 jobs in its monthly estimates. When the economy is barely adding that many jobs in the first place, that's another huge area of potential error.</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest economic data point that voters can take into the voting booth is this: the president, while having tremendous power over legislation, does not control the economy alone. He (or some day, she) depends on Congress, the Federal Reserve, small-business owners, corporations and even other countries to help support the American economy.</p> <p>The biggest fallacy of any election is that one man can cause, or fix, all of our economic ills.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 First came the suspension of politics. Then, exactly one day later, came the awkward splitting of reality into two: bipartisanship of a genuinely stirring kind in those areas worst hit by Sandy \u2013 and the resumption of warfare elsewhere. As Barack Obama and the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, surveyed storm damage, the president's press secretary told reporters: \"It's not a time for politics.\" Translated from Washingtonese, that meant \"release the Biden\" \u2013 and the vice-president responded with a Greatest Hits retrospective. \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/31/vp-im-being-a-good-biden-today/\" title=\"\">I'm being a good Biden today</a>,\" he told one crowd, though he did also call the Cleveland Plain Dealer, an Ohio paper, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IC2b_6ztnoU\" title=\"\">one of the major newspapers in this state</a>\", which technically speaking wasn't Ohio but Florida. He also needlessly risked offence by <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/joe-biden-are-you-indian-man-american\" title=\"\">asking a member of the public</a> \"Are you Indian?\" (\"American,\" the man replied.) And he insisted on telephoning one supporter's Republican brother, engaging him in an impromptu debate on healthcare, then expressing the hope that \"you'll vote for me in 2016\" \u2013 thereby <a href=\"ttp://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-biden-presidential-campaign-2016-20121031,0,4332077.story\" title=\"\">apparently announcing a run for the presidency</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Not that the president's camp seemed troubled. Indeed, Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod, was so sure of victory in the crucial states of Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania, he told NBC, that he'd \"come on [television] and I will shave off my moustache of 40 years if we lose any of those three states\". The American Moustache Institute (\"protecting the rights of, and fighting discrimination against, moustached Americans\"), which exists solely for comedic purposes, condemned the offer as \"incredibly irresponsible\". All credit to the Washington Post's Natalie Jennings, though, for <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/31/axelrod-bets-his-moustache-on-three-states/\" title=\"\">pointing out</a> that at least Axelrod was \"willing to put his money slightly above where his mouth is\". Current polling averages suggest his facial hair is probably safe \u2013 though it could be close. No, not a \"close shave\". We're not writing gags for Joe Biden here.</p> <p>\u2022 Just how deep does political division run in the toss-up state of Colorado? The highways outside the city of Boulder are peppered with the burrows of prairie dogs, a species of rodent related to the squirrel, and also, it seems, blessed with a degree of political awareness unusual among herbivorous burrowing animals. The Boulder Daily Camera newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_21886717\" title=\"\">reports</a> that tiny \"yard signs\" have started to appear outside their roadside burrows, bearing the logos of the Romney and Obama campaigns. The split in signage was roughly 50/50, suggesting that neither side can yet feel confident in having locked down the prairie dog vote, though admittedly it's also possible that the whole thing is some kind of prank. (Prairie dogs are well-known for their love of practical jokes.)</p> <p>\u2022 Squeaking in under the wire comes the election's best campaign ad, from Richard Tisei, a Republican congressional candidate from Massachusetts. It consists of 27 seconds of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Alzz11k9yMk\" title=\"\">relaxing footage of a Massachusetts beach</a>, apparently at sunrise, the waves lapping gently on the sand. \"Because you need a break from all the campaign ads,\" reads the caption. Contemplative quiet, gentle humour, and an appreciation for the natural environment: why haven't the Republicans expelled Tisei yet?</p>",
  "<p>For a sustainability or corporate responsibility director, the major threats to making a business a sustainability champion don't come in the form of pesky campaigners or a worsening financial climate \u2013 they come from the people sitting around them.</p> <p>In general, anyone tasked with the sustainability agenda for their company should spend at least half of their time outside the office. This is a major challenge when hours of the working week are taken up navigating internal politics, negotiating even small amounts of capital expenditure or overcoming organised resistance from all manner of departments. Too often time and resource are wasted making the case internally when they could be better spent actually doing something. So who needs convincing?</p> <h2>The far too busy and important CEO </h2> <p>The CEO sees peers and competitors getting credit for sustainability and demands to know why his or her company isn't doing the same. Once the order has come from the top, everyone scrambles around trying to pull together examples of good work already underway. It usually amounts to a fairly unambitious ad hoc set of recycling initiatives and a donation to a school.</p> <p>However let's assume the company is further down the path and there is good work underway to improve sustainability performance and derive some credit. This is the moment at which the CEO becomes key. It is also often the moment when the CEO's diary is almost impossible to negotiate.</p> <p>A schedule in which two annual sustainability 'slots' can only be found with great difficulty is not a diary of someone thinking daily about their company's planetary and social impact. It is almost as if some top bosses think sustainability no longer matters when their firm is out of immediate danger. This is a risky strategy.</p> <p>CEOs vary enormously by temperament, but many have certain traits in common. In the early years they look to make their mark by doing things differently to their predecessor; sustainability is one of the most powerful and commercially relevant ways to do this.</p> <p>Some CEOs wish to raise their personal profile and 'humanise' the look and feel of their company. Again, being hands-on about sustainability challenges \u2013 visiting farmers, water projects and factories \u2013 is one of the easiest ways to become known for more than just quarterly results. Statistics that bring to life what will happen to the commodity prices on which their business depends, what facilities and factories might be rendered impotent by climate change, what a lawsuit on a spill or child labour scandal might cost: these are things that increasingly get CEOs out of bed.</p> <p>In order to influence a CEO you have to understand what makes them tick, what drives them to increase business performance, what they wish to be judged upon. Part of this means helping them see emerging points of view, threats and opportunities; sustainability is still not the everyday natural parlance of the corporate sector.</p> <p>Some of the challenge lies in illustrating where competitors are outclassing them. This appeals to the competitive instinct without which you cannot run a major company.</p> <p>But I find that before all this, CEOs have begun to hear increased chatter levels about sustainability. Not from the business media or NGOs or governments; sometimes not even from customers. Often the first place they hear about all this is from their own employees.</p> <p>The workforces of multinational companies are the great untapped resource in promoting a positive vision of sustainable business. Too often effort is expended communicating on green and social issues to the outside world, instead of starting with the ready-made taskforce of ambassadors a company already has. Mobilising staff only accelerates the sustainability mission in a business. Enlightened CEOs spot it, nurture it, and enjoy the rewards of a motivated workforce that feels it, too, is changing the world.</p> <h2>The cynical finance director</h2> <p>The fastest time I have seen a company move from first base to advanced sustainability strategy was when the client's head of sustainability was also the group finance director. To have this often tricky obstacle as an enabler and driver is a rare luxury. Too often, finance directors see this tedious sustainability business as either simple compliance or a 'cost' (if your view of balance sheets is somewhere in the late 1950s).</p> <p>Accustomed to viewing everything in quarterly cycles, the idea of long-term ROI is a struggle for these directors. Often, sustainability directors spend as much time trying to circumvent finance directors as they do embedding sustainability in their business. The most successful corporate sustainability champions tend to have bridged this divide.</p> <p>Finance directors aren't easily convinced. Investors are still not clamouring for sustainability in the numbers or scale required for global transformation. The obvious route to a finance director's heart is to show the long-term cost savings and increased profit margins of implementing real, long-term sustainability initiatives. The sustainable business revolution is old enough to provide more than anecdotal evidence.</p> <h2>The blinkered marketing department</h2> <p>Some marketing professionals seem to see their role as ensuring nothing fundamental changes in whatever brand they promote. This is particularly true of household brands that have large consumer loyalty \u2013 be it toothpaste, a chocolate bar or hair gel, working with marketing teams on a new initiative such as packaging reduction or a certified ingredient can be hell for a sustainability department.</p> <p>Marketeers are often surprisingly illiterate about the major changes taking place within the consumer base they claim to know. Much of this knowledge gap comes from the research and focus group agencies they use that don't know what to ask consumers.</p> <p>I've lost count of the number of consumer research reports I've seen implying consumers will react negatively to a brand promoting sustainability innovation. \"Looks expensive,\" \"will it taste worse?\" are often highlighted in speech bubbles next to unreadable pie charts.</p> <p>It is clear the idea that consumers in western Europe and north America are banging down company doors demanding more sustainable produce is nonsense. That does not mean, though, that smart product innovations and brand outreach cannot carry consumers along the sustainability journey to great effect. Growth in sustainable seafood sales, certified coffees, chocolate bars and fruit show sustainability works.</p> <p>If a marketeer asks: \"Do you love your favourite snack the way it is?\", then loyal consumers will say: \"I love it, thanks.\" If a marketeer were then to ask: \"Would you love it as much if you knew it killed orangutans, destroyed rainforest and was picked by eight-year-olds?\", then many consumers would change their answer. The third question: \"Would you like reassurance that this product does good for people and the environment?\" then provokes an enthusiastic response. Many miss out the vital second question, seldom reaching the third.</p> <p>We have to do a better job at demonstrating the benefits of sustainability to the marketing industry. The entire basis of its training needs to be re-modelled.</p> <h2>The threatened and hurt</h2> <p>These are the people who think they've been doing a good job on sustainability and don't understand why suddenly their work is deemed unfit for the purpose. \"We've tried that before\", \"we're already doing that\", \"I think that would be a distraction\" are the most common phrases in this group's songbook. They might have spent years seeing sustainability as compliance and diligently collecting data as required. They may have attended conferences but failed to import their learning back to business because they had insufficient internal prominence. The problem is that if there is any decent information about a company's past performance, these people are usually sitting on it.</p> <p>The best way to deal with this is to make them realise all their good, if unambitious, plodding away is about to hit big time and take centre stage in the company's global strategy. They will be even more important than before, and none of it will be possible without their collaboration and help. Often the threatened then feel valued.</p> <h2>Recalcitrant managers</h2> <p>It's an unfortunate reality that many businesses have layers of internal management for which sustainability is not an exciting new frontier but an irritating set of KPIs designed to torment them. The indifference of these line managers often becomes the sticking point long after senior management have bought into sustainability and junior staff are motivated \u2013 those who are tasked with translating it into culturally relevant action plans don't want to know.</p> <p>\"Can't do it, won't do it\" attitudes can derail the best of bold intentions, which is why embedding sustainability metrics into appraisals \u2013 and, for the most advanced companies, linking pay and rations to individuals' performance in this area \u2013 is useful. Turning sustainability into a positive, incentivised activity rather than a burden is absolutely critical.</p> <p>This is an on-going challenge and requires the resource of a good HR director.</p> <p>While I'm a great believer in bottom-up as well as top-down management of sustainability, the most important nuts to crack are the CEO and the finance director. With their backing, leadership and commitment, the other obstacles become traffic cones instead of road blocks.</p> <p><em>Brendan May is founder of the Robertsbridge Group.

  "<p>Every day three scenes, on the surface unconnected, unfold in different corners of the world. By breakfast time in Macau, China's gambling mecca, thousands of people are inside vast casino resorts spending money on baccarat, poker, slot machines and restaurants. Managers monitor the profit by the hour.</p> <p>By lunchtime in Israel commuters and shoppers are perusing Israel Hayom, a brash giveaway tabloid and the country's most-read newspaper. It supports the government of Binyamin Netanyahu. And it clobbers rival dailies to the point of extinction.</p> <p>By dinnertime viewers in Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and other swing states in the US presidential election are watching, for the umpteenth time that day, television advertisements attacking Barack Obama and promoting Mitt Romney. Their volume and cost have set records.</p> <p>This eclectic, global triptych is connected by a fourth, less visible scene. In the quiet hum of his air-conditioned Las Vegas headquarters a short, portly man with thinning red hair absorbs reports detailing it all, Macau, Israel, the election, because in every one he is a player. He crunches the profits, circulation and polling and ponders his next move. His name is Sheldon Adelson, and he is one of the world's richest men.</p> <p>\"I suppose you could say that I live on Vince Lombardi's belief. Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,\" <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81588.html\">he told a recent interviewer,</a> citing the legendary American football coach. \"So, I do whatever it takes, as long as it's moral, ethical, principled, legal.\"</p> <p>No one doubts Adelson, 79, lives to win. But with the White House race entering the final stretch of what both sides call the most important election in decades there is growing controversy over his business interests and methods.</p> <p>\"I've studied Sheldon Adelson closely but I don't claim to know him,\" said John L Smith, a Las Vegas-based author and columnist who tangled with him in a bitter court case. \"I'm like a kid at the zoo watching the big predator but not understanding.\"</p> <p>How the son of immigrants \u2013 Adelson's Lithuanian-born father was a taxi driver, his British-born mother a seamstress \u2013 rose from poverty in Boston's tough Dorchester district to become a force in global politics and commerce is, depending on your perspective, an inspiring story of entrepreneurial grit and flair, or a cautionary tale of plutocracy and democratic dysfunction.</p> <p>Adelson, with a fortune valued at over $20bn, controls a unique web linking gaming empires in Nevada and Asia, media control in Israel and mega-donations to Romney and other Republican candidates.</p> <p>He represents a new breed of tycoon, said Chrystia Freeland, the editor of Thomson Reuters Digital and author of Plutocrats: the rise of the new global super-rich and the fall of everyone else. \"The caricature is of conspicuous consumption, yachts and jets, but for the super-rich the real status symbol is having a voice, having an impact on public policy, and in that sense Sheldon is characteristic of his class.\"</p> <p>He is not shy about declaring his wealth. \"You know,\" <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/30/080630fa_fact_bruck#ixzz2A4OeCImt\">he reportedly bragged to George W Bush</a>, when he was president in 2008, \"I am the richest Jew in the world.\"</p> <p>If few knew that then, many know now. Adelson has burst onto the international stage by becoming, as one observer noted, \"sugar daddy\" to zionist and conservative causes.</p> <p>He is a modern Croesus who converts cash into influence. The question, which to critics becomes more urgent with each day of the campaign, is the extent to which he may convert, or try to convert, influence into cash. In a written reply to Guardian questions, Adelson said he wished only that the White House invite him to its annual Hanukah party and save him some potato pancakes.</p> <h2>'He doesn't give up'</h2> <p>A Romney victory could yield Adelson billions in tax cuts and make the White House an ally. His businesses are under investigation from the justice department and other agencies over alleged wrongdoing in Asia.</p> <p>There was little in his background to suggest Adelson would become the right's impresario. Reared in liberal Massachusetts, he worked his way through multiple jobs \u2013 vending machine salesman, court reporter, real estate dealer, toiletries packager \u2013 and scored big with Comdex, a computer trade show he launched in 1979.</p> <p>In 1988 he bought a chunk of the Sands hotel and casino, a fading, one-time rat pack haunt and turned it into Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a glitzy triumph with the Venetian as its flagship. He gambled, correctly, that if he built convention centres conferences would flock to Sin City.</p> <p>Even in a town known to be filled with tough operators, Adelson's steeliness stood out. He drove aides as hard as he did himself, did not take no for an answer, and did not forgive trespasses.</p> <p>He successfully sued the Daily Mail for libel and in a separate case went after Smith and his publisher, Barricade Books, over a depiction of Adelson in Smith's book Sharks in the Desert.</p> <p>Threatened with a $15m lawsuit, the publisher entered bankruptcy and agreed to a judgement of libel. Smith also entered bankruptcy. A judge dismissed the suit against him and ordered Adelson to pay some of the author's costs. \"He's a real sweetheart,\" said Smith. \"He doesn't give up.\"</p> <p>Ron Reese, a spokesman who who has represented Adelson for a decade, defended his boss. \"It is easy to be a critic of someone if you don't know them, haven't taken the time to learn about their values, or if you are simply jealous of their accomplishments. It's a lot like criticising the coaches and players of a football match you didn't watch or attend. The fact is, Mr Adelson is among the world's greatest philanthropists and has created tens of thousands of jobs throughout his business career.\"</p> <p>What vaulted Adelson into a league Donald Trump can only dream of was Macau, the former Portuguese colony that is part of China and hosts gambling under the \"one country, two systems formula\".</p> <p>He outfoxed rival casino moguls to open the territory's first Las Vegas-style resort, the Sands Macao, in 2004. In reality it is two vast resorts, one of them the world's biggest. On its first day the crowd reportedly ripped doors off their hinges in a stampede for the gaming tables. Adelson recouped his $265m investment within a year.</p> <p>\"In 2004-5 the big question was when Macau would overtake Las Vegas; it was taking about $4bn to Las Vegas's $6bn. Now Macau is taking nearly $40bn a year - and Las Vegas is still on about $6bn,\" said Aaron Fischer, head of consumer and gaming research at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets.</p> <p>Asia \u2013 he expanded into Singapore \u2013 has made him a multi-billionaire. \"Other guys have made promises that may be they weren't able to deliver on. Sheldon stuck to the promises that he made [to officials] even though they have not always been perceived to have the best relationship,\" said Fischer.</p> <p>\"He doesn't have a reputation for always saying the right thing. I really think he's a character. I respect him and I find him to be quite honest and very down to earth. Maybe that's sometimes been his problem; he's not very good at diplomacy.\"</p> <p>Sergio Terra, editorial executive director of the Portugese-language newspaper Tribuna Macau, said Chinese officials bristled even as they benefited from Adelson's investment.</p> <p>\"He wanted everything and everything first. That's not the way the Macau government works. And he had to adjust to the Beijing approach. They don't like pressure.\"</p> <p>One veteran observer of the casino industry, who declined to be named, said Adelson charged through barriers. \"It's served him well but he might have knocked down a few too many and used weapons that are going to be subject to review by regulators. I think his quest is to be the world's richest man \u2013 I don't think he's made any secret of that. He's always referring to his ranking.\"</p> <p>Las Vegas Sands faces three lawsuits over its Macau operations: a former executive, Steve Jacobs, claims wrongful dismissal and alleges the company collaborated with triads and sought to blackmail officials. The company is also snagged in a bribery scandal and claims it violated US anti-money laundering laws. Adelson vehemently denies wrongdoing. \"We're going to be found absolutely clean,\" he said last year. The company blamed the accusations on disgruntled former employees.</p> <h2>Breaking into the Israeli newspaper market</h2> <p>Macau is the golden egg, but Israel is Adelson's enduring passion. The mogul often tells the story how he stepped off the plane for the first time wearing the shoes of his late father, who had been too poor to travel. His commitment has grown since marrying his second wife, Miriam, an Israeli, in 1991.</p> <p>The Adelsons have underwritten think tanks, exchange programmes, DC-based lobby groups and, most controversially, the interests of Netanyahu. Adelson believes Israel's hawkish prime minister is a necessary bulwark to supposed peace talks and Palestinian statehood, a prospect he abhors.</p> <p>After false starts, Adelson established his tabloid, Israel Hayom, in 2007. It now has a 38% share of the weekday newspaper market, compared to 36% for its main rival Yedioth Ahronoth, 11% for Ma'ariv and 7% for Haaretz.</p> <p>The heavily advertised paper is given away by uniformed distributors on the streets, outside supermarkets and at gas stations. It also has paid home-delivery sales.</p> <p>Its partisanship earned the nicknamed \"Bibiton\", a play on the prime minister's nickname and the Hebrew word for newspaper.</p> <p>Many have blamed it for the catastrophic demise of paid-for newspapers. Maariv faces possible closure. Haaretz is also in crisis, with layoffs and pay cuts looming. Yedioth announced cutbacks earlier this year, including dozens of job losses.</p> <p>The Israeli business website Globes quoted a senior Yedioth executive as saying: \"You must know that Israel Hayom is destroying Israeli journalism not only at the professional level, with its embarrassing editorial conduct, but also at the economic level.\"</p> <p>Israel Hayom was breaking the market with ads at zero cost, crippling rivals' revenue streams, he said. \"Israel Hayom has finished Ma'ariv, and it is now finishing Haaretz. Adelson has simply brought ruin.\"</p> <p>The mogul's friends disagree. \"He put his money up for an alternative voice and people liked it. That's capitalism,\" said Sig Rogich, a businessman and media consultant in Las Vegas. Rogich also defended his friend's plunge into this year's US presidential and congressional races after years of confining himself to Nevada politics. He has shattered records by spending an estimated $70m backing Republican candidates nationwide.</p> <p>\"This is a country built on the principle of freedom of speech,\" said Rogich. \"When George Soros funded the other side no one complained. Sheldon has been transparent (about his contributions). You have to admire the truthfulness of standing up and telling the world that's he's responsible for the message.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398724982\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/4/1344108450223/Sheldon-Adelson-and-his-w-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, expanded their involvement in US politics out of Nevada and onto a national state in the 2012 presidential campaign.

As the money has flowed, and as Paul Ryan and other Republican figures paid homage to their benefactor in Las Vegas, the New York Times, among others, <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/.../in-thrall-to-sheldon-adelson.html\">asked what does he expect in return</a>. </p> <p>Consciously or not, at a private fundraiser Romney echoed Adelson's views when he appeared to dismiss a two-state solution and said the Palestinians had no interest in peace. The Republican's proposed tax cuts could swell the mogul's bank account by about $2bn.</p> <p>In an interview with Politico, Adelson, who runs the only non-unionised resort on the Las Vegas strip, accused Obama's administration of waging a vendetta. If Romney wins, observers will closely watch the fate of the probes into Adelson's businesses.</p> <p>Onkar Ghate, a vice-president of the Ayn Rand Institute, which champions free markets, said tycoons had a right to fight back against vindictive governments: \"If they spend money purely defensively then I think that's entirely correct.\"</p> <p>But others, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21564418\">including the Economist</a>, fret that Super Pacs backed by the \"0.1%\" are rigging the system and entrenching inequality. \"It is hard to believe that this surge of cash from the richest will have no impact at all.\"</p> <p>Freeland, the author of Plutocrats, said Adelson's activism raised profound issues. \"Democracy is supposed to be one person, one vote. But when economic disparity grows and transfers into political disparity, well, you have to ask where it's going.\"</p> <h2>A conversation with Sheldon Adelson</h2> <p><strong>Guardian: You have made substantial donations to the Romney campaign. Do you expect a return from this investment? How do you respond to critics who say you are buying influence?</strong></p> <p><strong>Sheldon Adelson:</strong> I do not expect any type of return, except that if the candidate we are supporting becomes president he maintains this country's freedom and its free-market capitalist ways, as opposed to his opponent who I believe is following socialist policies \u2013 it may work in other countries, but not here.</p> <p>There is absolutely no expectation of any favoritism whatsoever, though If I'm fortunate enough to be invited to the White House Hanukkah Party I hope someone would save me a couple of potato pancakes. They ran out the last time I was there.</p> <p><strong>Guardian: Some critics also say a Romney victory could yield you billions in tax cuts and possible protection from multiple investigations into your business affairs. How do you respond?</strong></p> <p><strong>SA: </strong>I would be entitled to no preferential tax cuts or any other type of preferential treatment whatsoever. Any tax cuts that would apply to me would apply to President Obama, his wealthy donors, and everyone else. By the way, what is wrong with supporting a candidate whose economic views and values are the same as yours?</p> <p><strong>Guardian: It's been said of you that you are probably the most aggressive, unforgiving individual in the business world today. What do you say to that?</strong></p> <p><strong>SA:</strong> Friends I've had for as long as 70 years would never match that word with me or my way of life. The word unforgiving and my name don't belong together \u2013 it is inconsistent with my concept of giving away much more than I make or spend on my family to help repair the world \u2013 through our drug treatment centers which rehabilitate drug addicts, specifically women who turn to prostitution because of drugs; our medical research foundation; the strong support we provide for our military veterans here in the United States and many other causes.</p>",
  "<p>Who is the richest person to have lived? Given the impossibility of comparing chariots with private jets, this is an absurd question. But it is still one economists have sought to answer, with perhaps the best measure \u2013 as defined by Adam Smith \u2013 based on annual income as a multiple of the average wage of fellow citizens.</p> <p>Their answer is not Marcus Crassus, whose fortune was the same size as the entire government treasury of the Roman Empire. His annual return was paltry for a plutocrat, equating to the average yearly income of 32,000 Romans. Nor was it those robber barons of the Gilded Age \u2013 Andrew Carnegie, whose wealth peaked in 1901, took home the same as 48,000 typical Americans while John D Rockefeller's vast riches yielded an annual income equal to 116,000 of his countrymen.</p> <p>The wealth of these figures from history pales in comparison with the strutting financiers of Wall Street, the geeky billionaires of Silicon Valley and the grisly oligarchs who plundered Russia. Trumping them all is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/09/carlos-slim-tops-forbes-rich-list\" title=\"\">Carlos Slim</a>, the telecoms tycoon whose \u00a353bn fortune is equal to that of an incredible 400,000 of his fellow Mexicans.</p> <p>There has always been a gap between rich and poor but this is just one sign of how the gulf has widened into a chasm over the past few decades. Creaming off more and more wealth is a new elite, a transglobal class of mainly self-made men carving out unimaginable fortunes. They are the subject of this timely and absorbing analysis by former <em>Financial Times</em> deputy editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/feb/26/financial-times-tett-freeland\" title=\"\">Chrystia Freeland</a>.</p> <p>Forget the 1% targeted by the Occupy mob. Freeland is talking about the 0.1 per centers who look down with disdain at the paupers scrabbling around on a few million a year. She quotes another shocking sign of our times: three decades ago the average American chief executive made 42 times as much as the average worker; today this ratio is an obscene 380. And bear in mind the richer you are, the smaller proportion of your income you tend to pay in tax, levels diminishing even at the very top of the&#xa0;tree.</p> <p>Despite the cheap book cover and passing mention of private parties with pop stars paid a million dollars to perform, this is no voyeuristic glimpse into the fabulous lifestyles of the rich and famous. Freeland charts the rise of this class by examining global trends and exploring the consequences of the creation of such a money-laden elite, shifting smoothly from dense academic studies and interviews with George Soros to grappling with the success of Lady Gaga.</p> <p>So who are these people? They are nearly all men for a start, sacrificing family life in their search for a fortune. One executive spending a third of the year in transit says forlornly: \"We are the people who know flight attendants better than we know our own wives.\"</p> <p>Often middle-class and frequently mathematicians, they make their own money rather than inheriting it. They go to the top universities and create their first fortunes early. Many are outsiders to some extent \u2013 most Russian oligarchs, for example, were Jews clever and driven enough to get degrees from top universities under the old Soviet system \u2013 and often they are immigrants. Unsurprisingly, bankers and financiers dominate this club, followed by the technology titans, but \u2013 like pilot fish feeding on the leftover food from sharks \u2013 the likes of lawyers and even dentists who service their needs can join their ranks. \"The superstars who work for the super-rich can charge super fees,\" observes Freeland drily.</p> <p>Her findings are fleshed out with fine research, strong statistics and neat nuggets of information. She argues that technology and globalisation are creating winner-take-all superstars in many sectors who join a cosy, conformist bubble. These people flit round the world attending the same events and using the same services; they freely admit to having more in common with one another than their fellow citizens, whether coming from Africa, Asia or the west.</p> <p>Some display extraordinary arrogance. \"If a man is not an oligarch there is something wrong with him,\" said Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man \u2013 although his outlook has since been tempered by his time in jail. Indeed, extreme wealth and rampant egotism can be a combustible mix; in China, at least 14 billionaires have been executed over the past decade.</p> <p>Although short of solutions, Freeland highlights the danger when a small, self-serving and self-satisfied group dominate public discourse, then seek a system tilted even more in their favour. \"I think the ultra-wealthy actually have an insufficient influence,\" says one billionaire Republican donor. Another says taxes should be virtually abolished, arguing that the government should pay the likes of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs for their contributions to society. \"It's that top 1% that probably contributes more to making the world a better place than the 99%,\" he concludes outrageously.</p> <p>Yet these super-elites are not evil people; they genuinely think what is good for them is good for the rest of society. The irony, as the author points out, is that a big intrusive state is often the plutocrat's best friend, whether it's a state capitalist regime such as China or the protectionist capitalism of the west. Just look at all those fat-cat bankers who pushed for the biggest state intervention for a century to rectify their disastrous mistakes \u2013 although, needless to say, they don't blame themselves but all those poor people who choked on cheap credit after buying their dodgy products.</p> <p>As the financial meltdown showed, the best brains follow the money, so the regulators \u2013 earning a fraction of the immense incomes enjoyed by bonus-chasing bankers \u2013 were no match for the global behemoths. Such is their power and wealth, these mega-rich plutocrats proclaim free market values yet lobby hard and often successfully to bend markets in their favour, devastating the traditional middle classes and dislocating social mobility. In so doing, they are destroying the very things that gave birth to so many of them \u2013 to all our&#xa0;detriment.</p>",
  "<p>For Beijing residents to understand the gravity of the upcoming 18th congress of the Chinese Communist party, they need only to take a taxi. Or buy a toy. Or own a pigeon.</p> <p>While the Chinese government often boosts security during sensitive political meetings, measures surrounding the forthcoming congress border on extreme: Authorities have placed restrictions on buying remote-controlled helicopters, warned cab drivers to child-lock their doors, and instructed pigeon-fanciers to keep their birds caged.</p> <p>During the congress, which begins next Thursday, more than 2,000 delegates from across the country will gather in Beijing to approve a once in a decade leadership transition. Seven out of the country's nine top leaders will step down, including president Hu Jintao and prime minister Wen Jiabao.</p> <p>Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher in Hong Kong, said the authorities' clampdown on seemingly banal activities springs from an \"overabundance of caution\". \"They can't control everything, but they will do their best to try,\" he said.</p> <p>Chinese social-networking websites are rife with anecdotes about vanishing street food stalls and overbearing new security checks at train stations. Conferences, music festivals, football matches, and even the internationally well regarded Beijing marathon have been <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-10/25/content_15847553.htm\" title=\"\">cancelled at short notice</a>.</p> <p>Shopkeepers have been instructed to remove sharp items such as kitchen knives and pencil sharpeners from their shelves. The Happiness Supermarket in central Beijing replaced its stock of knives with neat rows of can openers and potato peelers. \"The police came in and said we're just not allowed to sell them,\" said an employee.</p> <p>There have been even stranger developments. Beijing's taxi drivers have been instructed to dismantle their backseat window cranks and child-lock their doors. \"The company management said at the meeting that in the past, some passengers had thrown leaflets out of the taxi window,\" <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/740900.shtml\" title=\"\">one driver told the Global Times</a>. A widely circulated post on Sina Weibo, the popular microblogging website, shows an ostensibly leaked set of rules for taxi drivers to follow during the congress. One instructs them to refrain from driving through \"areas of political importance\". Another warns them to keep an eye out for passengers holding slogan-bearing balloons and \"<a href=\"http://chinadigitaltimes.net/2012/10/taxi-zero-spread-rule-for-18th-party-congress/\" title=\"\">ping-pong balls bearing reactionary messages</a>\".</p> <p>Balloons and model planes have been banned during the congress, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper, which also quoted a police officer as saying that pigeon enthusiasts \u2013 ubiquitous in the city's old-fashioned neighbourhoods \u2013 must keep their birds grounded.</p> <p>Official notices have appeared on toy-store sales counters restricting the sales of remote-controlled helicopters \u2013 aspiring customers must now register at nearby police stations with their government-issued IDs, reported the Beijing Youth Daily.</p> <p>The security effort is striking if only for its sheer scale. Beijing authorities have \"processed\" 33,000 cases of \"illegal activities\" such as gambling, prostitution and unlicensed taxis since August, according to Xinhua, China's official newswire. Some 1.4 million volunteers have been recruited to bolster the capital's security presence. 1,725 businesses have been shut down.</p> <p>The former political prisoner <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hu-jia\" title=\"\">Hu Jia</a> said in a phone interview that he has been under tight surveillance since 18 September, when rumours about the conference date started to spread(The authorities did not announce the meeting's actual starting date until September 28th).</p> <p>On 20 October, state security officers escorted Hu to a train station in Beijing and bundled him off to his hometown in Anhui province. Hu said the police threatened his parents with violence if he returned to Beijing before the end of the meeting.</p> <p>\"This has been way worse than the 17th party congress,\" Hu said, referring to a similar event in 2007, while he was formally under house arrest. \"At that time I was allowed to go out and buy things to eat. This time there's just no way.\"</p> <p>Wu Lihong, an activist who was jailed from 2007 to 2010 for his environmental campaigning, said that the police have not allowed him to travel since the summer.</p> <p>Yet according to Wu, police in his hometown near Lake Tai in Jiangsu province were afraid that sympathetic neighbors would help him flee to Beijing, so offered to take him on a chaperoned \"vacation\" to scenic Huang Mountain in Anhui Province until late November.</p> <p>\"They say let's go look at the scenery, it's really beautiful, we'll go travel,\" Wu said in a phone interview from Lake Tai. \"But I won't go, and this gives them a headache.\"</p> <p>Zhang Feng, an official at the ministry of industry and information technology, denied rumours that China's internet will be shut down during the 18th party congress. But, Zhang told the 21st Century Business Herald newspaper, it will undergo maintenance \"<a href=\"http://www.21cbh.com/HTML/2012-10-26/0MNDE1XzU0ODg0MA.html\" title=\"\">to guarantee the conference can smoothly complete its work duties</a>\". The term \"18th party congress\", as well as the names of top political leaders including Hu, Wen, and presumptive future president Xi Jinping, have been blocked on Sina Weibo.</p>",
  "<p>What times we live in: strange and mutable, packed with incident. But every so often, something occurs that makes the very ground shake beneath us, an event of such importance that those who witness it feel the world stop for a moment, before continuing: but different now, changed for ever. We take these events with us to the grave, remembering not only their details, but&#xa0;the details of our own lives at the moment they occurred. In years to come, we feel driven to recall both, wryly contrasting the mundanity of the latter with the magnitude of the former.</p> <p>Lost in Showbiz feels confident that, at some distant point in the future, children too young to remember Tuesday 30 October 2012 firsthand will look to those who bore witness and plaintively ask us: \"What were you doing when former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Chantelle Houghton<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/lostinshowbiz/2012/oct/30/chantelle-houghton-sex-dungeon-twitter\" title=\"\"> revealed that her ex-partner, cross-dressing cage fighter Alex 'The Reidinator' Reid, had 'turned my house into a sex dungeon'?</a>\"</p> <p>For a mercy, there isn't space here to go into the full chain of events that led up to Houghton's Twitter explosion: the marriage proposal on live TV, the breakup, Reid's demand that Houghton stop airing their grievances in public \u2013 a&#xa0;demand fairly mind-bogglingly made in a video shot by Now! magazine during an interview with showbiz reporter Dan Wootton.</p> <p>But even before his former partner took to the microblogging site, it was shaping up to be a bad week even by the standards of The Reidinator, a man who earlier this year had to contend with his ex-wife Katie Price enlivening a press conference to promote her new&#xa0;novel by informing the assembled journalists that she had once stuck a vodka bottle up his bum. There was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/31/review-come-dine-with-me-halloween\" title=\"\">an appearance on Celebrity Come Dine With Me</a>, during which Reid's cage-fighting tough-guy image took a bit of a knock when he was relentlessly bullied by, of all people, TV medium \"Psychic\" Sally Morgan, his woes compounded by glamour model Nicola McLean offering her frank appraisal of his personality: \"I think he's a bit of a twat.\" Worse, the resulting programme was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/nov/01/alex-reid-come-dine-with-me\" title=\"\">outranked in the ratings by both Autumnwatch and Watchdog</a>. But such&#xa0;things paled into insignificance following Houghton's online tirade, in which she also accused him of texting prostitutes about orgies, arranging to meet a man \"for sex\" while dressed as his alter-ego Roxanne, and trying to get his hands on money placed in a trust fund for their daughter.</p> <p>And yet, at the sex dungeon revelation, Lost in Showbiz found itself swelling with a certain admiration for Price's hapless former paramour. For one thing, there was Houghton's insistence that he had thus transformed her home when she was eight months pregnant with their child. Lost in Showbiz doesn't know how much experience its readers have of heavily pregnant women, but it can remember only too vividly the tsunami of wildly unpredictable hormonally driven emotions that constituted the latter months of its own wife's pregnancy, a&#xa0;period of its life that Lost in Showbiz spent in a permanent state of bafflement and fear, having quickly realised the most innocuous of queries, suggestions or actions could provoke a&#xa0;tearful screaming fit. It recalls with a shudder the evening that the question \"this gravy's nice, what's in it?\" was inexplicably answered with a lengthy and expletive-laden monologue, delivered at enormous volume centimetres away from Lost in Showbiz's face, in which its multitude of failings as a husband and indeed human being were expounded on in wounding detail. Frankly, by the time its wife was eight months gone, Lost in Showbiz was so terrified of her that it wouldn't turn over the TV without getting written permission first. Given that, at the same period in his partner's pregnancy, The Reidinator apparently took it on himself to turn her house into a sex dungeon without telling her, Lost in Showbiz can only boggle at his fearlessness. This man doesn't deserve our opprobrium, he deserves a medal for bravery. What a pity this year's Pride of Britain awards have already come and gone.</p> <p>Second, who can fail to be impressed by the sheer scale of the enterprise? After a thought-provoking afternoon's Googling, Lost in Showbiz can report that the internet abounds with websites offering helpful information on the construction of a DIY sex dungeon: presumably you don't just ring up your local builders and ask them to give you a quote for one (\"Are you Check-A-Trade registered? I'm looking for someone to make me a sex dungeon\"). Their advice ranges from the practical (\"a cheap Ikea overdoor shoebag makes&#xa0;ideal storage for sex toys and nipple clamps\") to the eye-watering (\"construct a testicular vice out of perspex so the victim's crushed flesh can be seen\") to sad tales of BDSM \"bloopers\" (\"unfortunately the load-bearing studs were not conveniently located for a fucking sling\"). But they all have one thing in common: they're about converting a single room. By Houghton's account, Reid converted her entire house. The remodelling works were so extensive she had to move out and \"sleep on my flat floor\".</p> <p>Without wishing to condone turfing a heavily pregnant woman out of her own home in order to create a more pleasing environment in which to slake your fell desires, Lost in Showbiz once again feels impelled to take its hat off to the Reidinator. A whole house! This is a man with vision! Come Dine With Me? He should have been on Grand Designs. What an episode that would be: Kevin McCloud sadly shaking his&#xa0;head as a supporting wall is inadvertently removed to make way for a mock gynaecological examination table, and earnestly asking: \"Did you not consider having this so-called 'rim chair' made out of <em>sustainable</em> materials?\" Lost in Showbiz doesn't want to tell Channel 4 its business, but it is fairly certain more people would tune into that than Autumnwatch.</p>",
  "<p>The US has added 1.1 million new millionaires since Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, according to a new survey of high-net-worth individuals.</p> <p>Amid an election campaign that has been defined by fierce fights over the taxation of millionaires and accusations that Obama is anti-wealth, the so-called \"1%\" of the population grew by 29%, the equivalent of a thousand new millionaires per day, over the president's first three years in office. According to analyst WealthInsight, those high-net-worth individuals now hold assets worth $18.8tn \u2013 34% of total US individual wealth, well above the global average of 29%.</p> <p>\"It doesn't really fit the campaign rhetoric that one side is against the rich and the other is for,\" said WealthInsight analyst Christopher Rocks. \"The total number of millionaires is growing and will continue to grow whether Obama or [Mitt] Romney is elected.\"</p> <p>The number of new US millionaires fell following the financial crisis. At the end of 2011 there were just over 5.1m millionaires in the United States \u2013 165,360 fewer than in 2007, before Obama's election and the worst of the financial crisis. The recent rise in stock markets and signs of a recovery in real estate mean the number of millionaires will be back to pre-recession levels by the end of 2012. </p> <p>However, their wealth will remain below 2007 levels until the end of 2013. In 2007, high-net-worth individuals' total wealth was about $20tn; WealthInsight forecasts that at the end of 2012 the number will be fractionally lower, at $19.9tn. By the end of 2013, such individuals' wealth will top $21tn, surpassing pre-recession levels. WealthInsight calculates that the total number of US millionaires will reach 6.1m by 2016, when their assets will be worth $23.5tn.</p> <p>The super rich have come back fastest in the financial services sector. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals \u2013 those with assets in excess of $30m, excluding their primary residences \u2013 in the sector has risen by 12% since 2007. Manufacturing accounted for the wealth of 16% of the super rich, followed by transport and logistics at 10% and technology and telecommunications at 8%.</p> <p>The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression had little impact on the ultra-wealthy. At the end of 2011, in the US, the super rich numbered 39,378 compared to 40,197 in 2007. Similarly, in 2011 the wealth of \"ultras\" was about $5.5tn, down from $5.6 tn in 2007.</p> <p>Connecticut, which is home to many hedge-fund billionaires, experienced the fastest growth in ultra-rich people under Obama, rising 26%. The largest number of ultra-rich people were found in New York, with 4,363 people defined as ultra-rich. Texas came second with 3,828, according to WealthInsight.</p> <p>\"Politics is short-term,\" said Rocks. \"The trend is clear \u2013 there are a lot more rich people.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Good afternoon, Nicki. What scared you when you were six years old, and what scares you now?</strong></p> <p>Heights, and heights.</p> <p><strong>Did you have a traumatic height-related experience?</strong></p> <p>Yes! When I was younger, in Trinidad, one of my cousins was really tall and he would pick me up then throw me in the air. I was so scared. I remember thinking: \"I'm a young kid, I'm going to die, why is everyone laughing?\" I was three years old!</p> <p><strong>I was once put in a hammock by a sailor, and now I don't like hammocks. </strong>You see <em>I do</em> like hammocks. I need you to get over that fear.</p> <p><strong>We're sitting here in Selfridges because of your new lipstick, which is flamingo pink. What are the top five shades of pink?</strong></p> <p>Well, flamingo pink. Hot pink. Baby pink! HOT PINK! And fuchsia <strong><a href=\"#1\">(1)</a></strong>.</p> <p><strong>Flamingos are pink because they eat pink things. If you were to turn the colour of what you eat the most, what colour would you be?</strong></p> <p>Now that's a <em>great</em> question. [Guffaws] I'd be brown! [Cackles] <em>Like fried chicken!</em> No, I don't eat fried chicken any more. I'd be yellow. Yellow like a mango. I eat a lot of mangoes.</p> <p><strong>Your lipstick business is a bit different from normal product endorsements. Can you explain your connection? </strong>Two of my mom's brothers died of Aids, in Trinidad. It was a long time ago, but they passed, both of them. On top of that, a quarter of a million people in Trinidad have Aids [see clarification footnote]. That's a lot of people on a tiny island, and it's an island that I'm from. Forty percent of adolescents in Trinidad have no education on HIV and Aids. And that's what the campaign does \u2013 it puts it out there on blast. Awareness, awareness, awareness. And my fans really got behind it. They made my lipstick the biggest-selling Mac Viva Glam lipstick ever, and now we're introducing the lipgloss.</p> <p><strong>That part is a bit lost on me, Nicki. I've never even worn lipstick. </strong></p> <p>[Eyes light up] You've never put on lipstick? [Turns to entourage] Do we have a brand new lipstick? [Grabs lipstick from assistant] Now, I'm going to apply it. Look, you start right on the outer ridges. Oh my God <em>look</em> at how your face is coming to life already! [Continues applying lipstick] Amazing. I love it. Oh this colour is so <em>pretty</em>. Do you have children?</p> <p><strong>Yes.</strong></p> <p>Oh God. [Turns to entire entourage] Doesn't he look <em>nice?</em> I swear! I'm not kidding! It looks pretty. I know that's not what you wanted to hear. [Brandishes hand mirror] Look!</p> <p><strong>That's actually marginally better than I was expecting. </strong></p> <p>RIGHT!</p> <p><strong>If you were to go back to LaGuardia <a href=\"#2\">(2)</a> and teach pop music, what would be the lesson on day one?</strong></p> <p>Arch your back and stick your boobs out.</p> <p><strong>On whom do you model your amazing English accent <a href=\"#3\">(3)</a>?</strong></p> <p>[Slips into amazing English accent] There are so many, but one person was Scary Spice.

[Back into Nicki voice] Oh, and Hermione from Harry Potter!</p> <p><strong>Can you do a Scary Spice face now?</strong></p> <p>[Contorts face into ludicrous expression] There!</p> <p><strong>You know your song Marilyn Monroe <a href=\"#4\">(4)</a>, and the way it is the best song on the album?</strong></p> <p>Yes!

We're going to take <em>care</em> of that one.</p> <p><strong>What advice do you have when it comes to dealing with idiots on the internet?</strong></p> <p>Not to react! I've got caught up in reacting, sometimes, 'cos I'm crazy. It's better to realise that they're not talking to you, they're talking to your image. I'm not Nicki Minaj.</p> <p><strong>CANCEL THE INTERVIEW! </strong></p> <p>[Laughs]<strong> </strong>But seriously, it's important to know that you're an amazing person. You have to know that as long as you love who you are \u2013 your morals, your values, that type of stuff \u2013 you're OK. And I have to remind myself of that, I really do. It gets tough. I just tell people: don't even come in the business if you think it's going to be peaches and rainbows and unicorns. It's not for the faint of heart. It's for fighters.</p> <p><strong>I like to think of your lyric \"starships are meant to fly\" as being a heartfelt line about human beings not reaching their full potential in life. But is it just there to rhyme with \"reach up and touch the sky\"?</strong></p> <p>No, that's exactly it! That's what I feel. Just go for it! Stop limiting yourself! And that's a great feeling.

I was at his full debut for the Fire against Chivas USA earlier this year, and while he had an eventful game (conceding a penalty, then scoring an equalizer a couple of minutes later), there wasn\u2019t much to suggest he would go on to have such a breakthrough season. That said, interviewing him afterwards I was impressed by how unfazed he was by the occasion - only becoming modestly excited with the news his family had flown in for the occasion.&#xa0;</p> <p>But when Arne Friedrich was out injured, rather than becoming unmoored without his more experienced counterpart, Berry grew in stature, and he and DC United\u2019s Nick DeLeon are now neck and neck for <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2012/10/24/rookie-rankings-two-left-standing-dust-clears-2012\">MLS 2012 Rookie of the Year</a>. For me, Berry\u2019s consistency has shaded it, despite how quickly DeLeon has integrated himself into his team. Berry has been steady in an exposed position, and even chipped in with goals, for his side, while DeLeon has been more eye-catching at times, but disappeared a little after a bright start. Both would be worthy winners, but after Tim Ream missed out a couple of years back, I'd like to see a good young defender rewarded.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091c71295cb39eabe475ebc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T00:49:22.408Z\">12.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Houston Dynamo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Dominic Kinnear has a way of getting a side ready to peak at the play-offs. This year, he looked to have skipped a beat, as the Fire\u2019s late season surge coincided with a late season stutter by Houston. They were still difficult to beat, but too many ties were creeping into the equation, as the Dynamo slowly began to lose traction in the playoff race. A 3-1 win over Philadelphia on the penultimate weekend was good, but only negated the 3-1 loss they\u2019d suffered to the same opponents when the playoff contenders were beginning to shake out a month earlier.</p> <p>Pluses: designated player Oscar Boniek Garcia has slotted tidily into the 4-3-3 when it\u2019s employed and on his day is very hard for defenders to pick up (though the reluctance of Kandji to defend continually asks questions of a system designed in part to accommodate his undoubted pace and talent). Ricardo Clark is back with all his playoff experience, and Davis and his set pieces are still in the mix. Minuses: you can\u2019t replace a Geoff Cameron (sold to Stoke City) just like that - and the defense has been an issue. Whether they win or not tonight will depend on large part on their midfield smothering Chicago\u2019s and dominating possession. In an open game and a straight shootout, Chicago might well edge it.</p> <p>On a broader note, having completed their beautiful BBVA Compass Stadium this Spring, and ridden the attendant home bounce to an unbeaten record there, Houston could have done without their further participation in the play-offs being contingent on victory on the road tonight. Still the prize for victory is that with two legged semi-finals and finals to come, Houston\u2019s home form could yet be a significant factor in this competition - and of course they have the memory of what happened last year when they faced Philadelphia. Just like the Fire, the Union had lost momentum coming into the playoffs and the Dynamo duly eliminated them with a 2-1 victory at PPL Park followed by a routine 1-0 win at their old Robertson Stadium \u2014 sparking a run that took them all the way to the MLS Cup final.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091c629b57959e43bca9544\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T00:45:29.473Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chicago Fire</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The key to Chicago\u2019s line up for this game may now reside in Holland. Heerenveen signed Marco Pappa from the Fire in the summer and then promptly benched the former Chicago star. Around his departure and to a lesser extent the sudden absence of playmaker Grazzini, came a risky overhaul by Frank Klopas that could easily have been a tinkering too far - just see Vancouver Whitecaps having to hastily get back to basics, after their own revolving door gathered speed then threatened to run out of control this summer. Instead, aside from the disappointing Alvaro Fernandez, Chicago developed a more multi-faceted and productive attack for much of the second half of the season. Fan favorite Chris Rolfe returned and was able to play a slightly unfamiliar role to great effect, ensuring that Grazinni, seemingly permanently exiled to Argentina, was not unduly missed. Playmaker is not what Rolfe really does, but in linking the midfield and attack and chipping in his share of goals (8), alongside new designated player, Sherjill Macdonald (4) he helped the Fire go on a run of 8 wins in 9 games, through August and September.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was a run that was bookended by a draw in San Jose and a 2-0 road loss to Sporting Kansas City. The latter game - billed as a potential Eastern decider, seemed to knock the rampant Fire team off track. They lost next time out to Philadelphia, rallied to beat a New York side with problems of their own, then suffered another embarrassing loss in New England, before last weekend\u2019s decisive and disappointing draw against DC.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, there\u2019ve been signs that the defense, marshalled by German veteran Arne Friedrich and the blossoming talent of rookie Austin Berry, has settled again, and they\u2019ll be tough for Houston to break down. Here\u2019s what happened when the sides last met, during that run by the Fire in the Fall.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVxmctbKTbY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nVxmctbKTbY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091c44eb57959e43bca9543\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-01T00:37:35.116Z\">12.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Welcome to the first of the wild-card games that will narrow the field for MLS Cup - as Chicago Fire host Houston Dynamo. And it should be an absorbing struggle, as two of the teams in the East who\u2019ve both enjoyed their moments in the sun this year, face off against each other, with one side, Chicago, slipping rather alarmingly from the form that catapulted them into the playoff mix, and the other, Houston, seeming to run out of steam as their season, front-loaded with road trips while their stadium was being finished, began to lose momentum with the addition of Champions league fixtures and a general uncertainty over what system worked best for them.</p> <p>Both sides have rather limped over the line, though Houston at least got to retire from the race a little early, after New York\u2019s victory over Philadelphia meant that no matter what they did at Colorado over the weekend, they were bound to finish fifth. Dominic Kinnear duly rested key players in advance of tonight\u2019s game, and the Dynamo went down to a meaningless 2-0 defeat.</p> <p>Chicago meanwhile, started the weekend in third and hosting second placed DC United, in what was in essence a pre-wild-card game, with high hopes of overtaking them on the last day. They took a lead, relinquished it, and then could not get past Bill Hamid in the DC net, to finish their regular season in fourth and this face tonight\u2019s game.</p> <p>So neither side is exactly enjoying a surge of momentum coming into this one, though on the plus side, the winner of tonight\u2019s game will get a decent bounce going in to face Sporting Kansas City in the Eastern Conference semi-final. I\u2019m not going to be so foolish as to try to call it, but we have taken the liberty of preparing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/30/mls-cup-previews-2012\">a complete playoff preview for your edification</a>, and we have also canvassed the opinion of some of our regular game previewers for these teams, in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/31/mls-cup-2012-wild-card-fan-previews\">a special wild-card edition of our fan previews</a>.</p> <p>Have a read of those, and using your new found knowledge of gut feelings in Illinois and Texas, send me your own thoughts on tonight\u2019s game to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com\">graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com</a> and I\u2019ll be back shortly with more build up and team news.</p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>The invitation to the White House in the spring of 2009 struck Barack Obama's allies in the environmental movement as a big moment: a clear sign that climate change was on his radar and that the president was eager to get to work.</p> <p>The event was indeed a turning point, but not the one campaigners expected. Instead, it marked a strategic decision by the White House to downplay climate change \u2013 avoiding the very word \u2013 a decision some campaigners on the guestlist say produced the strange absence of climate change from the 2012 campaign, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/sandy-climate-change-us-election\" title=\"\">until hurricane Sandy blew it right back on the political agenda</a>.</p> <p>The storm \u2013 which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/obama-sandy-aftermath-campaign?utm_term=%23SGS&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">interrupted campaigning for three of the last eight days of the presidential race</a> \u2013 may even prove the decisive factor in the elections, with voters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/30/new-jersey-christie-obama-response-sandy\" title=\"\">watching how Obama handles Sandy's aftermath</a>. The devastation has already sparked debate about America's present-day vulnerability to climate change.</p> <p>But back in 2009, the off-the-record event with the White House green team at the old executive office building offered the first chance for the White House to share its plans for getting a climate change law through Congress. Aides handed round a one-page memo of polling data and talking points.</p> <p>\"It was in the context of the financial collapse. With everyone struggling, how do we connect with the public and build political support when everyone's mind was on the very scary economy,\" said <a href=\"http://breakthroughstrategiesandsolutions.com/About_Us.html\" title=\"\">Betsy Taylor, president of Breakthrough Strategies and Solutions</a> an organisation that works with philanthropic and non-profit clients, who attended the meeting.</p> <p>The answer was clear: climate change was not a winning message. Raising the topic would also leave Obama open to attack from industry and conservative groups opposed to intervention in the economy.</p> <p>\"What was communicated in the presentation was: 'This is what you talk about, and don't talk about climate change'.\" Taylor said. \"I took away an absolutely clear understanding that we should focus on clean energy jobs and the potential of a clean energy economy rather than the threat of climate change.\"</p> <p>The message stuck. Subsequent campaigns from the Obama administration and some environmental groups relegated climate change to a second-tier concern. After industry and conservative groups mobilised to attack Obama's policies and climate science in the summer of 2009, the topic was seen as an even greater liability and politically toxic.</p> <p>There was no mention of climate change during six hours of televised debate. Moderators failed to bring up the question, and Obama and Mitt Romney made no effort to fill in the gaps \u2013 even during a long and heated exchange about offshore drilling and coal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/29/ann-romney-chris-christie-address-video\" title=\"\">Romney's convention speech</a> reduced climate change to a laughline. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">Obama defended climate science at the Democratic convention</a>, and he answered a question on climate in an MTV interview last month.</p> <p>Otherwise, Obama mentioned climate only in passing and in front of safe or rock-solid Democratic audiences, such as fundraisers in San Francisco and New York or events on college campuses. Since Sandy's devastating storm, a number of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/sandy-climate-change-us-election\" title=\"\">prominent Democrats like Bill Clinton and Al Gore have talked about climate change</a>, and taken Romney to task on the issue.</p> <p>Those gathered on 26 March 2009 to hear from key members of Obama's green dream team \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/25/carol-browner-obama-climate-advisor-departs-white-house\" title=\"\">Carol Browner, then energy and climate adviser</a>, Nancy Sutley, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq\" title=\"\">Council on Environmental Quality</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/07/van-jones-resignation\" title=\"\">Van Jones, then green jobs adviser</a>, believed it would be a pivotal year.</p> <p>The White House and both houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats, world leaders were due to gather in Copenhagen in December to finalise a global climate change treaty.</p> <p>But the economy was in meltdown. The White House, after studying polling and focus groups, concluded it was best to frame climate change as an economic opportunity, a chance for job creation and economic growth, rather than an urgent environmental problem.</p> <p>\"My most vivid memory of that meeting is this idea that you can't talk about climate change,\" said Jessy Tolkan, who at the time was a leader of the climate youth movement, Power Shift. \"The real sense at that time was that talking about clean energy jobs, green jobs, was the way we were going to be able to gain momentum and usher in real change. Talking about climate change and global warming was not going to resonate as much.\"</p> <p>None of the principal White House officials would talk on the record about the meeting. The White House did not release materials related to the meeting or respond to a request for visitors' records.</p> <p>But most of the environmental groups were inclined to go along. \"When the White House invites you to a meeting and says: 'here is how we are going to talk about these things', it sends a very clear message,\" said <a href=\"http://www.foe.org/about-us/our-team/our-president\" title=\"\">Erich Pica, president of the US Friends of the Earth Action</a>, who was also at the meeting.</p> <p>Now with Obama fighting for re-election, and the climate agenda stalled and under constant attack from Republicans and industry, environmental groups acknowledge the go-softly strategy was a mistake.</p> <p>\"I thought it was a mistake and I told them,\" said Bill McKibben, who heads the <a href=\"http://350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a> group, who was one of the few people at the meeting to voice his misgivings. \"All I said was sooner or later you are going to have to talk about this in terms of climate change. Because if you want people to make the big changes that are required by the science then you are going to have to explain to people why that is necessary, and why it's such a huge problem,\" he said.</p> <p>The stealth approach also gave the opposition an opening. The White House reluctance to even mention climate change allowed some in industry and on the right of the political spectrum to discredit climate science.</p> <p>Others argue the strategy of downplaying climate change was a politically necessity. It was na\u00efve to expect to get ambitious measures through Congress in a debate clogged up with scientific detail.</p> <p>\"I don't think it was a mistake,\" said Steve Cochran. vice-president of climate and air at the <a href=\"http://www.edf.org/\" title=\"\">Environmental Defence Fund</a>. \"The people that supported climate were already with us. The people who had questions needed arguments beyond climate, which led to more and more focus on arguments beyond climate.\"</p> <p>Campaign groups agree Obama continued to push the climate agenda, even if he did so below the radar, through the Environmental Protection Agency regulations and other branches of the government.</p> <p>The economic recovery plan included some $90bn for green-ish measures, such as high speed rail and public transport, and weather-proofing low-income homes.</p> <p>Obama also publicly embraced some environmental measures, standing out in front when the administration proposed raising car mileage standards in May 2009. But the president left climate change out of his Earth Day event, and was a no-show in June 2009 at the release of a landmark scientific report on how America's cities and coastlines would be affected by climate change. There was no mention of climate change in his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/25/state-of-union-2012-environment\" title=\"\">2012 state of the union address</a>.</p> <p>Environmental groups, taking their cue from the White House, also downplayed climate. The coalition pushing for climate change law in Congress called itself Clean Energy Works. The bill itself was called the American Clean Energy and Security Act. Campaign groups ran ads featuring former steel workers in green helmets talking about the well-paying new jobs building wind turbines.</p> <p>\"If you look at the messaging being done during the climate legislation, it was mostly not about climate,\" said Carl Pope, who was then the executive director of the Sierra Club. \"They realised it was going to be a big target as soon as it passed the house.\"</p> <p>And it nearly didn't pass. The house of representatives' vote on the climate bill was uncomfortably close, 219-212, with only eight Republicans supporting and 44 Democrats opposed, and it set off a furious backlash.</p> <p>The oil and gas industry alone spent $175m in 2009 trying to block climate legislation, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2010/08/pro-environment-groups-were-outmatc.html\" title=\"\">according Open Secrets</a>, which tracks money in politics. The conservative Tea Party movement turned opposition to climate legislation, even climate science, into an article of faith.</p> <p>In the summer of 2010, the US senate dropped the bill, with then Democrat Senate majority leader Harry Reid admitting: \"We know we don't have the votes.\"</p> <p>The administration and environmental groups talked about climate change even less, said Pica, and when they did the connections were even less clear.</p> <p>Facing public confusion about the green jobs promised by Obama's recovery plan, and scepticism about his promise to build a clean energy economy, administration officials switched to talking about climate through healthcare or even national security. They recruited Iraq war veterans to talk about wind energy.</p> <p>\"There was a really big emphasis on talking about what I call the sub-narratives \u2013 that there were other ways to speak about the opportunity and the challenge of climate change rather than calling it that,\" said <a href=\"http://climaterealityproject.org/our-ceo/\" title=\"\">Maggie Fox, the chief executive of Al Gore's Climate Reality Project</a>. \"There was a whole suite of sub-narratives: national security, clean energy future, diversification of energy, health, future generations \u2026 \"</p> <p>But Fox acknowledges none of those reasons \u2013 although compelling \u2013 went far enough in justifying the need for sweeping transformation needed to avoid catastrophic climate change. \"Over time it became in effect an absence of conversation about climate change as a threat, and I think in the end that proved to be unwise because it is the one reason all these storylines matter.\"</p> <p>The problem now, say campaign groups, is that it has become even more difficult for politicians to talk about climate change, even when evidence is all around them in extreme weather events and even when there is growing public concern about climate change. <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Climate-Beliefs-September-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">A Yale University study last month found 70% of Americans now believe in the reality of climate change</a>, a sharp rise over the last two years. The administration, the campaigners say, missed an educational opportunity.</p> <p>Obama, in debates and in campaign stops, continued to talk up the importance of investing in America's future through building a clean energy economy. But the connection to the threat of climate change was lost.</p> <p>\"It's really hard to sell clean energy. Clean energy is really struggling because the story has gotten garbled,\" said Larry Schweiger, president of the <a href=\"http://www.nwf.org/\" title=\"\">National Wildlife Federation</a>. \"You can't have a clear conversation, and the reason there can't be a clear conversation is because of this elephant in the room which is climate change.\"</p>",
  "<h2>SUPER CALEY GO BALLISTIC, RANGERS ARE ATROCIOUS, IS THE HEADLINE WE'D DEFINITELY HAVE USED HAD THIS STORY BEEN ABOUT THE LEAGUE CUP IN SCOTLAND AND NOT THE CORRESPONDING TOURNAMENT SOUTH OF THE BORDER</h2> <p>On the face of it, last night wasn't a particularly good one for Liverpool. They had been in proud possession of Tin Pot, the shiny three-handled metal jug which the do-gooders of the Football League charitably loan out each year to the most desperate and needy in society, the idea being that everyone should get the chance to feel special at some point. Sort of like when it was Dribbling Dave's turn to look after the class gerbil at infant school. (He's now PM, proof positive this isn't just wishy-washy liberal nonsense.) But yesterday evening the Football League was forced to confiscate Tin Pot from Liverpool, because they simply hadn't been looking after it properly. Joe Cole had got his head stuck in it, and spent the entire time waddling around blindly, clanking into things in the style of a knock-kneed buffoon. A League mandarin eventually managed to prise Tin Pot off Cole's confused noggin, but not before it had been battered completely out of shape, and covered in drool to boot. Oh Joe! Oh Liverpool! You'll not be seeing Tin Pot again any time soon, we'll be bound!</p> <p>Still, it wasn't all bad news for Liverpudlians, because at Stamford Bridge, secret agent Scott Wootton, with Anfield roots but subsequently planted at Old Trafford, ensured rivals Manchester United won't be in possession of Tin Pot this season either. For Wootton delivered a masterclass in humour, the sort of act that hasn't been caught on film since the imperial phase of Harold Lloyd, one which could only have been more slapstick had he been receiving therapy for motor-skills disorder from Dr J Cole. Wootton spent most of United's tie at Chelsea bowling people over for penalties, gifting possession to the opposition near his own goal, and hanging precariously off the face of a clock, a routine which single-handedly snatched defeat from the jaws of victory for United \u2013 and for which a thermonuclear Sir Alex Ferguson hilariously blamed Nani instead.</p> <p>All good knockabout fun, quite literally in Wootton's case, but the evening was to leave a sour taste \u2013 it's almost as if Carling should still be the tournament sponsor \u2013 when some toolkit in the crowd was spotted supposedly acting like a toolkit. An image published on the internet appeared to show some loser throwing monkey shapes at one of United's players, while breathing heavily through his mouth, though that second bit may not have been a conscious part of the gesture. Chelsea are looking into the matter, as well as investigating a series of objects pelted on to the pitch from the away section. Given what also happened last weekend, it's just as well these two clubs won't be playing each other for a wee while. Chelsea in particular, with Refgate looming over them, really could do with some space to chill out and relax. So, what's next up for them, then? A trip to their old pals in Leeds for the first time in eight-and-a-half years, that's what. Oh Tin Pot! How could you!</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"This prize is important only if Zlatan wins it. This would prove it to be a fair and independent award.

  "<p>Expanding into new markets is often tricky and complex for small businesses. There are a number of tasks which can seem daunting, from spotting the right country to establishing export links.</p> <p>A recent panel discussion on Accessing New Markets, jointly organised by the Guardian Small Business Network, Lloyds TSB and Institute of Directors, at Gatwick focused on the issues involved in expanding into emerging markets.</p> <p>The panellists \u2013 Steve Hyams, international business manager of Lloyds TSB, Sagar Patil, co-founder of the Global Entrepreneurs' Meeting (GEM) Club and David Seall, chairman of the IoD in Surrey under the chairmanship of Guardian industrial editor Dan Milmo \u2013 had a broad brief in covering 'new markets'.</p> <p>The discussion focused on expanding overseas, countries with better growth rate, the reality of the 'easy option' of selling in Europe and finding out about the markets.</p> <p>The panel stressed the need to target markets in which there was still room for expansion. \"More than 50% of world growth is predicted to be coming from 10 emerging countries in the next 18 years,\" said Hyams. Patil concurred, pointing out that in terms of consumer spend, Europe and Japan are declining. \"[Businesses targeting] consumer markets should aim at BRIINCS \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, China and South Africa,\" he said.</p> <p>Milmo talked about how few entrepreneurs speak a second language.</p> <p>Patil said local markets had to be seen as local ecosystems with some of their own rules. \"For example unlike the west, the east works on personal relationships more frequently than on business logic. There might be no business logic in having a business relationship but they retain it so that it makes business sometime in the future.\" In many regions, such as the Arab world, India and elsewhere, the business language is English so speaking it isn't actually a disadvantage.</p> <p>Marmite, Hyams said, spent a lot of money marketing itself in India only to find that the local population was not at all sold on the idea of bread with a spread on it, or indeed toast. \"So they marketed it as a flavouring for cooking and it sold,\" he said. The company was flexible and able to repurpose its product to fit the local ecosystem, turning a spread that would have been disastrous into what turned out to be a rousing success.</p> <p>Inevitably a lot of British businesses stick with targeting Europe because it appears easier. Often the media gives the impression that European regulations are too unwieldy and overregulated to deal with. A show of hands from the audience, however, proved that most of them weren't finding this at all. There are other areas in which it is difficult to establish a smaller business' presence, though. The EU and other territories in which there was actual growth still seem to have a lot of projects in the public sector.</p> <p>Small businesses often feel left out of these deals. Seall, IoD chairman, said we need stronger leadership in UK and possibly elsewhere. Under previous administrations, for example, it had been clear what was available for tender and what wasn't \u2013 this gave entrepreneurs and managers an idea of where they might be wasting their time in even thinking about bidding but it's not there now. \"There's a strategic vacuum from government at the moment,\" he said.</p> <p>To get the attention of public sector contractees internationally, Patil recommended a strategy of joining a consortium, which would then be harder to ignore \u2013 and to remember that definitions of 'small business' varied outside the EU. \"'Small' in the UK might mean 100 people, which in Mauritius, Vietnam and other places that would be considered large,\" he said. An alternative to joining a large consortium is joining up with a local business, which as long as the right company is selected was thought to be a good strategy for opening up territories.</p> <p>But do banks back small businesses? Milmo quoted figures that suggested only two out of 10 companies applying for credit got it. Hyams, however, said his bank approves eight out of 10 applications. There is a formal appeal process in place, he explained, and if a business appealed successfully it would secure both its loan and some compensation for the refusal. This covered startups as well as established businesses, he said.</p> <p>The panel also said that it was vital to look for the right advice at the right time \u2013 before signing the contract. An audience member suggested UKTI and LinkedIn as sources for contacts overseas.</p> <p>The audience also raised the issue of offering equity instead of borrowing when seeking funds. There are many organisations, funding networks and groups of small investors offering such finance options.</p> <p>However, investors can be a mixed blessing. Seall pointed to a number of instances in which the short term venture capitalist had risked damaging companies. \"I was at an AGM of one business which was really on a roll, making a lot of profit, beating all its targets \u2013 then one of the key investors, a VC fund, said 'sorry, we're getting to the end of our usual period, we want to get out' \u2013 just because they didn't usually invest for the long term.\" He called for a change in investment culture, to encourage and seek long term investments.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 December 2012 to correct a statement made at the roadshow.</p> <p><em>The </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Small Business Network</em></a><em> and Lloyds TSB Commercial will be running 12 regional seminars in total, in conjunction with the Institute of Directors.

  "<p>\"Amazing\", \"wonderful\", \"wow\", \"great result\", \"incredible\". It's hard to imagine any housing job attracting such superlatives, but that's how my normally sober friends from the now defunct Audit Commission reacted to my new posting as housing executive for the south Atlantic island of St Helena. And apart from astronaut or rock star, I can't imagine any job deserving it.</p> <p>Mind you, not all comments were so effusive: \"sounds really interesting if that's what you want\" was typical of well-meaning friends who don't share my enthusiasm for housing and travel. Others enjoyed the irony of me having turned down a housing policy manager post in London because I didn't want to commute, only to end up in one of the remotest places on the planet \u2013 five days by boat from Cape Town or three days from Ascension Island, if you can get there.</p> <p>Discovered by the Portuguese and settled by the East India Company and freed slaves, St Helena is a volcanic island with a population of 4,255 and located more than 1,200 miles (1,931km) from south west coast of Africa. The island's economy has been on a downward trajectory since the growth of air travel. The loss of trade has been matched only by the exodus of young people seeking work and a living wage.</p> <p>This is now set to change: a huge airport investment, a five-star hotel and the unique attractions of the island look set to reverse the trend. St Helena is a microcosm of Costa Rica, with its 400 native species, incredible geography and with its capital city's high street made up of listed Georgian buildings. It's being shortlisted for world heritage status \u2013 just so long as there are homes for the hundreds of people who will now be attracted to stay and return to the island. This is where I come in.</p> <p>As housing executive I have responsibility for improving the existing housing stock, developing new homes and even new communities. The most exciting part of the job is that there is a blank sheet of paper when it comes to housing legislation and housing management. St Helena has had very little of either.</p> <p>This is not, thank goodness, about imposing UK practices on the island. It's pretty clear to everyone that the UK model has failed: we've failed to develop the number of homes we need, the planning system continues to move at the pace of a supertanker and localism places even more weight in favour of the haves over the have nots. The result is that house prices are way beyond the means of all but a few first-time buyers, homelessness is rising fast and the housing benefit bill is going through the roof.</p> <p>There really could be an alternative. It's all about land use since that affects land prices and, in turn, housing costs. Shielding housing prices from the ravages of inflation is the way to make housing affordable for local people in perpetuity.</p> <p>At the same time, international investment and luxury homes are essential for future development. We have an opportunity to get the right balance between social rents, incomes and the benefits system.</p> <p>Unfortunately the UK agenda appears to be to force up social rents so high that nobody earning a half decent income will want to rent, to privatise the housing associations now that they are earning huge surpluses and to continue to reduce benefits to such a level that anyone who can't get a job feels the pain. What I'd also rather avoid are the convoluted and costly financial models being developed to make a broken system work.</p> <p>St Helena is a special case, with the challenges of climate, terrain, supplies and local people naturally wary of an unknown face. Then there is the unique natural environment, with 400 indigenous species including the wirebird and the world's oldest known living creature, Jonathan the giant tortoise.</p> <p>No wonder Charles Darwin liked it so much. The volcano last erupted several million years ago, which may or may not be a good thing. I am hoping that neither it nor the local people will have cause to erupt at my arrival.</p> <p><em>Andy Crowe is housing executive for the government of St Helena.

The government is clear that these must be properly sited and they must provide genuine benefits for local communities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leadsom says she is disappointed Hayes is not answering her question. She asks about her constituents who have fought a wind farm but had that opposition overturned on the basis that national policy overrides local wishes. Davey says ministers don't comment on particular planning decisions, \"but I have made it absolutely clear, working with the DCLG [Department for Communities and Local Government], that the planning system needs to be more responsive to local communities\".</p> <p>Caroline Flint asks Davey how closely he is working on wind farms with his Conservative colleagues.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My honourable friend suggested I use the word \"intimately\", but, er ...

Osborne said the government needed to listen to all coalition MPs and that \"the real test\" would be when the House of Commons was faced with a choice of whether to accept a deal or go for the alternative - as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/nov/01/politics-live-blog-fallout-for-eu-budget-defeat#block-509242ccb57959e43bca9574\">Clegg repeated earlier</a>.</p> <p>\"Let us see what we bring home, if we think there's a good deal,\" Osborne said. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenemulholland\">H\u00e9l\u00e8ne </a>writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osborne said other member states had favoured a freeze, pointing to a letter Cameron signed in 2010 with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, the Dutch prime minister and the prime minister of Finland \"saying that they want a freeze, at worst a freeze and, actually, there was the possibility of a reduction. Let's see what happens in these negotiations and there are a lot of moving parts here.\"</p> <p>He said the moment of truth would come when the House of Commons was faced with a choice of whether to accept a deal or go for the alternative.</p> <p>\"It will come in the next year or so. It will only come if, in David Cameron's judgment and the judgment of the British government, a deal is better than no deal. If that is our judgment then we will put it to the House of Commons, but the House of Commons is sovereign and it will make that decision.</p> <p>\"The question is and the question that the House of Commons and the British government will have to face and, ultimately, I guess, it's also for the British people is: 'Is that deal better than the alternative?' And the alternative if we don't have a deal in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and, of course, we've not just got to get this past the House of Commons, there are also 26 other European countries who have also got vetoes and the like, are they also prepared to live with a deal?\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/helenemulholland\">H\u00e9l\u00e8ne </a>also has some reaction from Tory MPs.

  "<p>The latest government initiative to relax planning laws is driven by the need to stimulate the economy and remove obstacles in one of the most difficult fiscal environments many of us have ever seen.</p> <p>Planning legislation is about social policy \u2013 the maintenance of communities and the protection of the environment for residents today and into the future. It is also about encouraging commercial development. The economic viability of schemes is an important consideration and, thanks to the overlap between public and private interests, tensions often come to light within the system. Two questions arise as a result:</p> <p>\u2022 Do the proposals go far enough to make the balance sufficiently fair to all involved?</p> <p>\u2022 Will these changes improve and speed up development as the government hope?</p> <p>In the case of the proposed planning reforms, it seems the scales have been tipped very much in favour of private interests. If government rhetoric is to be believed, the proposed new regime aims to \"get Britain building\". Unfortunately this means that rather less consideration has been paid to how this will affect the wider public.</p> <p>For example, one proposed change is an expansion of the existing permitted development rights to allow for extensions to homes and business premises for a period of three years. Neighbourly discord is likely to increase as a result and some councils, including Tory-led Richmond, have already expressed their desire to restrict these proposed new rights in order to avoid local conflict.</p> <p>In theory, councils will be able to reject the government's proposals under the Article 4 Direction (more typically used in conservation areas) which allows local authorities to remove permitted development rights if these are seen to be harmful to the local community. If the government does permit councils to evoke Article 4, the proposal will achieve very little in reform and (by implication, at least) in assisting the national economy.</p> <p>A more tedious but equally important point is that these proposals are reliant on the resources of councils and the planning inspectorate for their success. Demand outstripping the capacity to deliver the reforms is a real concern for all involved.</p> <p>However, the prevailing view of the property industry is that the planning system needs a much more fundamental overhaul to speed up, simplify and make it more flexible (with or without economic growth). The proposals are certainly promising, but walking the tightrope between public policy concerns and supporting developers remains a challenge. This challenge must be mastered if indeed we are to get Britain building again.</p> <p>There is good news here, but we are a long way off striking that balance between sustainable public policy and the desire to support developers which would allow Britain to get building in any meaningful way.</p> <p><em>Rachel Lee is a solicitor at </em><a href=\"http://www.brecher.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Brecher</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/local-government/\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Hugh Grant and some of the country's leading journalism academics, including two former heads of BBC News, have renewed calls for the end of self-regulation of the press as battle lines are drawn ahead of the publication of the Leveson report.</p> <p>The actor has launched a spirited defence of the Hacked Off campaign which he fronts <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8743851/what-im-fighting-for/\" title=\"\">in the Spectator magazine</a>, claiming he is not out to muzzle the press and would close down the lobby group if he \"detected even a bat's squeak of genuine threat to public interest journalism\".</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/8744591/what-the-papers-wont-say-2/\" title=\"\">in another Spectator comment piece published online on Thursday</a>, former Daily Mail and Daily Express political journalist turned PR Kirsty Walker made the opposite case, warning of the \"chilling effects\" Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry is already having on newsrooms.</p> <p>The academics, including the former director of global news at the BBC Richard Sambrook and the corporation's former head of news Ian Hargreaves, both now at Cardiff University, said in a letter published in Thursday's Financial Times that proposals for a new press watchdog made by newspaper editors would merely extend the life of the discredited Press Complaints Commission.</p> <p>In the Spectator, Grant said he would even back Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre, who caused a furore at the Leveson inquiry after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/feb/07/paul-dacre-leveson-hugh-grant\" title=\"\">accusing the actor of spreading \"mendacious smears\"</a>, over his right to be \"impertinent, spiky, nosey and unfawning to power or success or wealth\". \"[The press] have always pissed people off, as they should,\" he added.</p> <p>But he said the press are \"the Goliath\", part of the establishment that has \"effectively run the country for the past 40 years\".</p> <p>Grant said he would support Leveson if he were to recommend a new press regulator, independent of the industry and government, with minimum statutory underpinning.</p> <p>\"What I (and Hacked Off) campaign for is only this: that the press should obey the law and comply consistently with a fair and decent code of practice,\" he added.</p> <p>\"If we detected even a bat's squeak of genuine threat to public interest journalism we would pack it in. In fact, we also campaign for public interest defences in law for journalists in libel, bribery and other cases. We want more investigative journalism, not less. We want journalists to be free to speak their minds, unconstrained by their corporate masters. That's why we share platforms with the NUJ.\"</p> <p>Grant's Spectator article was published on the same day that 26 academics including professor James Curran of Goldsmiths and Steven Barnett of the University of Westminster came together to reject proposals put forward by newspaper editors and executives, who oppose statutory underpinning for a new press regulator.</p> <p>The academics dismissed the proposals as \"an attempt to perpetuate self-regulation by editors, an approach that has been shown over nearly 60 years to have failed both journalists and newspaper readers\".</p> <p>The proposals were made by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jul/09/leveson-inquiry-lord-black-lord-hunt-live\" title=\"\">Lord Black, Telegraph Media Group executive director and the chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, the body that funds the Press Complaints Commission</a>, at the Leveson inquiry after consultation with all newspaper groups including the Guardian. Black's plan calls for a new body which has the power to investigate newspapers and impose fines but editors would still be involved in the watchdog.</p> <p>Walker, who now works for PR agency iNHouse Communications, wrote in the Spectator that the mere prospect of Leveson's report, which will offer the government recommendations on the future of press regulation, had already encouraged \"the rich, the powerful, the venal and the pompous to intimidate journalists and frighten papers into not covering stories\".</p> <p>\"This is the judge who read a 200-word article in the Times about how The Thick of It was planning to satirise him in one episode \u2013 and promptly asked the editor of that paper whether it was 'appropriate' for him to run the piece. It is all too easy to guess what a judge with such an attitude to newspapers will do for press freedom,\" Walker said.</p> <p>The academics' letter and Grant and Walker's interventions marks a stepping up of the lobbying ahead of the publication of the Leveson report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/30/leveson-report-late-november?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">now expected in the last week of November</a>.</p> <p>Ten days ago the Free Speech Network was launched with support from industry bodies including the Newspaper Society, Society of Editors and Newspaper Publishers Association to campaign against statutory regulation. Tim Luckhurst, journalism professor at Kent university, said at the launch that \"officially regulated press\" would \"spell the slow, painful death of a raucous, audacious and impertinent press\".</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>The movements of the North Korean leadership have long been a source of fascination to outside observers. When the country's Dear Leader died late last year, it was only a matter of days before <a href=\"http://www.kimjongillookingatthings.tumblr.com/\">Kim Jong-il Looking At Things</a> was replaced on tumblr with <a href=\"http://www.kimjongunlookingatthings.tumblr.com//\">Kim Jong-Un Looking At Things</a>. </p> <p>More seriously, with so few sources of information on the Hermit Kingdom, analysts scan the official media for hints of possible changes in policy and personnel. The recent disappearance of First Lady Ri Sol Ju from public view - and her subsequent reappearance this week - fuelled endless speculation: Could she be pregnant? Had she briefly fallen from favour?</p> <p>The US-based <a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/\">NK News</a> site and the <a href=\"http://www.keia.org/ \">Korea Economic Institute of America</a> - which is funded by South Korea, via a think tank in Seoul - have now launched a data visualisation project for such visits. The <a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/nk-leadership-tracker/\">NK Leadership Tracker</a> pulls together 17 years worth of information from sources such as North Korea's state news agency and the South's Unification Ministry, allowing users to filter events geographically or pull out information such as which officials have appeared with the leaders. </p> <p>There's a limit to the conclusions one can draw from treating this kind of data in this way; one analyst warned against equating a week-long visit to a province with a brief stop at the foreign ministry in Pyongyang. But Tad Farrell of NK News says it illustrates trends such as the increased prominence of Kim Jong-un's aunt Kim Kyong-hui and her husband Jang Song-thaek in recent years. </p> <p>\"Of course, it's propaganda,\" added project officer Luke Herman. \"You are not seeing the full picture; you are seeing what North Korea wants you to see. But it is one piece of the puzzle.\"</p> <p>The trickiest part remains how to contextualize and interpret the raw data, said John Delury of Yonsei University. \"Drawing one-to-one correlations between visits to military units and a hardline posture, for example, does not necessarily work. Kim might have reason to pay even more attention to the military in a period when he is tilting the balance away from the KPA [Korean People's Army] toward the party, government, and 'people's economy'.\" he noted.</p> <p>\"Still, NK Leadership Tracker is a user-friendly, graphically-innovative site that puts a lot of information at our fingertips, and is a real contribution to more rigorous study of the DPRK by paying attention to what their political leaders say and do.\"</p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022 Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Nurseries import hundreds of thousands of potentially diseased ash trees into Britain every year because the grant system that funds most commercial tree planting is unpredictable and chaotic, leading forestry companies have claimed.</p> <p>Growers are also sceptical that the government ban on imports of ash trees to prevent the spread of the fungus that causes ash dieback will be effective, because they say it is not extensive enough.</p> <p>\"The government has not banned imports \u2013 it has just insisted that ash trees come from a pest-free area,\" said Jamie Dewhurst of J&amp;A Growers. \"It is possible for anywhere in Europe to be declared a pest-free area, so imports may continue after inspections. We cannot rely on the government to sort out this mess: the fact remains that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/uk-forests-unprecedented-threat-disease\" title=\"\">European plant health regime has proved to be inadequate</a>.\"</p> <p>But Defra rejected this, a spokseman saying: \"All ash trees have been banned from coming into Britain from any country indefinitely.\"</p> <p>Ash trees infected with the <em>Chalara fraxinea</em> fungus that causes ash dieback were first detected in the UK in a nursery in Buckinghamshire. The disease was confirmed in the wild last week and the government introduced a ban on ash seedlings from infected areas from Monday.</p> <p>Nearly 10 million young trees of all species are imported to Britain for planting annually, of which hundreds of thousands are likely to be young ash trees whose origins and health are unknown, said Grant Murray, sales director at <a href=\"http://www.albatrees.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Alba trees</a>, the UK's biggest container tree grower.</p> <p>But British growers say that foreign imports are not needed. \"It's ridiculous,\" said Murray. \"British nurseries could easily grow all the trees needed here and we could guarantee their health, but there is absolutely no predictability about what will be needed to plant in Britain. The grant system is unstable and in chaos.\"</p> <p>The industry depends on government grants to landowners and the Forestry Commission, which determine which tree species are grown where. The criticism from the industry is that Whitehall makes changes too often, so it is hard for tree nurseries to predict demand.</p> <p>\"We never know year to year how many [trees] will be needed. So many nurseries have had to make up shortfalls from imports,\" said Murray. \"If the bureaucratic grant system was better run, then there would have been far fewer imports and we might have avoided this situation.\"</p> <p>He said demand was controlled by the decisions of a few civil servants. \"We do not know what is happening until our trees are halfway through their growing cycle. You buy from one European nursery and you do not know whether they have brought them in from another. Every year the industry burns hundreds of thousands of trees at the same time as it imports them.\"</p> <p>According to trade body the <a href=\"http://www.confor.org.uk/Default.aspx?pid=1\" title=\"\">Confederation of Forest Industries,</a> nurseries either overproduce and then have to destroy hundreds of thousands of young trees every year, or grow what they think will be needed and then import. \"For a long time we have said we need long-term thinking. All the changes in grants result in uncertainty. We have had a hiatus where no grants are available for several years,\" said Jane Karthaus of&#xa0;ConFor.</p> <p>The shadow environment secretary, Mary Creagh, said that the 25% cuts to the budget of the Forestry Commission made it likely that it will be impossible this year to ascertain how far ash dieback has spread into Britain's 90 million ash trees.</p> <p>\"Those cuts have reduced the Forestry Commission's ability to identify and tackle tree disease,\" she said.</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: \"We work with people who are given funding through our woodland grant schemes to help ensure their woodland planting schemes are successful. The species of trees grown is ultimately their choice, and nursery businesses have to plan for what they believe their customers will want.\"</p>",
  "<p>The nuclear industry could get subsidies from the taxpayer to build new reactors, the new energy minister has said, despite opposition in the coalition agreement and repeated assurances to the contrary.</p> <p>John Hayes told MPs on Thursday that new nuclear power would not receive specific government subsidy but could be eligible if other forms of electricity generation also benefited from the scheme.</p> <p>The Conservative minister's admission during energy questions in the House of Commons appears to back up a long-held suspicion that the government's proposed scheme to offer a guaranteed minimum price for new low-carbon energy to encourage companies to build new capacity \u2013 known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/20/coalition-u-turn-nuclear-energy-subsidies\" title=\"\">Contracts for Difference</a> \u2013 would become a backdoor subsidy for the expensive nuclear industry.</p> <p>In reply to a question from the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Simon Hughes, Hayes said: \"Let me be crystal clear \u2026 there will be no direct payment, no market support for electricity supplied or capacity provided by a private-sector nuclear operator, unless similar support is also made available more widely to other types of generation.\"</p> <p>His reply was seized on by the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, who said: \"A subsidy is still a subsidy, even if it is given to others.\"</p> <p>The one-hour session for all three ministers at the Department for Energy and Climate Change was the first appearance in his new job for Hayes. This week in an <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225531/Minister-signals-end-wind-farm-We-pepper-turbines-country--declares-energy-minister.html\" title=\"\">interview with the Daily Mail</a> he appeared to signal his opposition to building more onshore wind turbines, declaring \"enough is enough\".</p> <p>That view, popular with many of his party but in contradiction to coalition energy policy, prompted warnings from private renewable companies and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\" title=\"\">put-down from Ed Davey</a>, the Lib Dem climate secretary.</p> <p>On Thursday the two men were at pains to put the incident behind them. Hayes joked more than once about his reference to \"bourgeois leftwing intellectuals\" whom he supposed to be behind onshore wind power. But he also delivered a strong statement in support of renewable energy, though notably there was no direct mention of wind power.</p> <p>\"The commitment to renewable technology is an essential part of delivering the energy mix: that builds sustainability, it helps us meet our targets [to cut emissions and increase renewables], and it's also good for consumers because that mix guarantees our energy security,\" he said.</p> <p>Davey faced several questions over perceived splits in the department. \"My honourable friend the minister for energy [Hayes] and I might on occasion disagree on issues of substance, and I certainly didn't agree with his comments the other day, but I certainly admire his style,\" joked Davey.</p> <p>Greg Barker, the other Tory climate minister, revealed that the department was considering a new subsidy paid through electricity bills \u2013 known as a feed-in-tariff \u2013 for households that install energy efficiency measures. Currently such tariffs are only available for homes and businesses that fit small-scale renewable technology such as a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/24/feed-in-tariffs-solar-wind\" title=\"\">wind turbines or solar panels</a>.</p> <p>\"This is one of a number of measures under active consideration at the moment,\" Barker said. It could be added to the upcoming energy bill through a government amendment, he said.</p> <p>Labour asked Hayes about doubts over the coalition agreement's pledge to support four projects to showcase carbon capture and storage at coal and gas-fired power stations. The government is running a competition for one such scheme, and there have been reports that money earmarked for the other three has been spent by the Treasury on other projects.</p> <p>\"Britain is the world leader. It's critically important in dealing with emissions we recognise that carbon capture and storage can be a vital part of those ambitions,\" Hayes said. The shadow energy minister Tom Greatrex said the delays were putting at risk up to \u20ac600m of European funding.</p>",
  "<p>The National Children and Adult Services Conference (NCAS) last week was an essential diary entry for anyone with responsibility for commissioning and delivering social care services. It was a way of keeping up with best practice and latest thinking.</p> <p>It is also a necessary respite from the lonely role of director, especially in the current financial times, when the real challenge for local government is the increasing number of people needing care and protection.</p> <p>The mood at NCAS this year was surprisingly upbeat \u2013 possibly because of the change in minister for adult social care. Norman Lamb MP has taken on the role and attended the whole conference, listening to the workshops and meeting with directors. It was obvious that he was not only well informed but also willing to learn more and understand the challenges.</p> <p>Richard Humphries from the King's Fund offered a good challenge to the Dilnot debate at the conference, and made the point that there was money to spend if we chose to. The NHS underspent by more than \u00a31bn last year, and this saving could be redirected into social care \u2013 having separate funding streams no longer makes sense.</p> <p>The challenge is not just Dilnot, however. We need to also ensure there is enough funding for everyone who needs care and support, especially at a time when increasing numbers of people with learning disabilities need properly supporting in the community.</p> <p>The week after 11 workers at Winterbourne View were sentenced is a good time to reflect that it is not only about money.</p> <p>Quality of care is the most important aspect of our work, and while many might debate the relationship between quality and funding, what we saw at Winterbourne were yet more examples of abuse of power, combined with those in authority being unwilling to challenge the concerns being raised.</p> <p>We are still treating people with learning disabilities and mental health needs in a dehumanising way and seeking to lock them away, as we did many years ago.</p> <p>Dr Margaret Flynn, who wrote the serious case review on Winterbourne View, spoke at the conference, asking the minister to consider the closure of all such assessment and treatment centres.</p> <p>These centres are not cost effective, do not serve the people who are sent there well and contradict all of government's current policies of supporting people locally in a person-centred way. We have not spent years closing long-stay hospitals just to see these centres emerge and repeat all of the mistakes we abhorred in the institutions of the previous century.</p> <p>But we do need to help make our communities friendly for people to live in locally. There has been lots of work done on dementia-friendly communities, and perhaps we need to do the same for people with learning disabilities.</p> <p>The other hotly debated issue at NCAS was the idea of integration between health and social care and what it means. Again, it is something we have been trying to sort out for many years, and we need to be clearer about what we are trying to achieve.</p> <p>Of course people want co-ordinated care provided by professionals who talk together and plan together \u2013 as every serious case review in childrens and adults identifies \u2013 but that is achieved by improving relationships, making time for people and aligning budgets around individuals. These are all things we can do now, tomorrow, within our current resources and people.</p> <p>We need to stop talking and start doing, so that we have social workers, nurses, doctors and other professionals recognising the parts that they need to play in achieving outcomes for people \u2013 and not hiding behind organisational barriers.</p> <p>Integrated care is simple good practice for any professional involved in the health and social care of any individual \u2013 we only don't do it because we haven't created the environment for it to flourish. That is our challenge between now and the next NCAS conference in 2013.</p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

The Dallas collective often mistaken for a cult in thrall to their charismatic, ever-joyous leader, Tim DeLaughter, has spotted its perfect niche: performing cult musicals for fancy-dress party crowds.</p> <p>For Halloween, clad in blood-red robes and black boas, they recreate (most of) the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show_(soundtrack)\" title=\"\">Rocky Horror Picture Show soundtrack</a>, DeLaughter relishing the role of Frank-N-Furter in a panto vampire cape. His <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc80tFJpTuo\" title=\"\">Tim Curry</a> impression is fan-faithful, and his band's silken take on these pouting pastiches of boogie-woogie rock'n'roll transcends the tribute act, thanks to their sawing cellos, blaring horns and maniacal harpist. Yet an am-dram air pervades, even when The Time Warp finds the entire stage pelvic-thrusting blasts of steam and confetti.</p> <p>Rocky dispatched, a large red ribbon is stretched across the stage, from the centre of which DeLaughter cuts a heart to unveil the white-clad Spree of old. Even in this second set of their own material, they include a hefty chunk of the Who's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV_9pn7MGUo\" title=\"\">Tommy</a>, suggesting they might finish with a run through side two of Abbey Road. But the closing half-hour finally reaches event status: glitter cannons are set to semi-automatic, the ecstatic choral punch of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uzddaCSwpE\" title=\"\">Section 8 (Soldier Girl)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My4Khyt5_ps\" title=\"\">Section 9 (Light &amp; Day/Reach for the Sun)</a> is dampened little by the reduction of the choir to four. DeLaughter is a rousing presence, riding the crescendos and using a frozen pause in their Andrew Lloyd Webberian, prog-epic Section 19 (When the Fool Becomes a King) to wander the stage, playing everyone's instruments like a shaman who has stopped time. His unbridled positivity neutralises all traces of cheese \u2013 so expect them back on Valentine's Day, doing Mamma Mia!.</p> <p><em>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>Shell has warned that the global economy is weakening \"just about everywhere\" as it reported a 6% fall in third quarter profits.</p> <p>The oil and gas group's chief financial officer, Simon Henry, said business and consumer demand was weak \"across the board\" in Europe, with the consumer retrenching in north America as well \u2013 although the industrial sector has performed more strongly in recent months. Shell said net adjusted profits fell 6% to $6.6bn, reflecting lower gas and oil prices. Shell's average third quarter gas price in the Americas fell by 38% against last year, while the Brent crude oil price has slipped 3.5% over the same period to $109.50 per barrel.</p> <p>Asked by reporters about demand weakness in the global economy, Henry said: \"In the last couple of quarters it is just about everywhere. European demand, specifically consumer and commercial industrial demand, is pretty weak across the board and there are few signs of recovery.\" Referring to north America, he said there was \"stronger commercial industrial demand\" but the consumer and retail market was \"relatively weak\". Some emerging markets, such as Brazil, Turkey and Poland, are performing well, said Henry, with China \"recovering\" after some weak quarters.</p> <p>Analysts said the quarterly production average of just below 3m barrels a day \u2013 from fields in areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Nigeria \u2013 indicated softening demand. \"Volumes are actually quite weak, below 3m barrels a day for the first time in three years in what's supposed to be a growth year,\" said Royal Bank of Canada analyst Peter Hutton.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/30/bp-beats-forecasts-5bn-profit-dividend\" title=\"\">As with BP earlier this week</a>, Shell said its downstream business \u2013 which refines oil products \u2013 had benefited from shortage of supply from Venezuela and the US, which pushed up refining margins. Henry warned, however, that refining remains under pressure. \"We are seeing a weak economy all around us,\" said Henry. \"So the downstream rally could be short-lived.\" In an indication of the long-term pressures facing an over-supplied refining industry, a Shell-backed consortium agreed this year to buy the Coryton refinery in Essex and convert it into a fuel import terminal.\"</p>",
  "<p>The BBC World Service has urged all its network news journalists to consider voluntary redundancy as it aims to avoid compulsory layoffs as part of \u00a342m budget cuts.</p> <p>The BBC's global arm is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/18/bbc-world-service-73-posts/\" title=\"\">closing 73 editorial posts</a> following its cut in funding by the government in 2010.</p> <p>Post closures include 16 in network news, which includes domestic journalists based around the UK, 14 in World Service news, and two in newsgathering for world and business.</p> <p>Stephen Mitchell, the BBC's deputy director of news, urged staff to consider voluntary redundancy in an email on Thursday morning.</p> <p>He said: \"We are committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies where possible, and have previously been very successful in achieving this. We hope to continue our good record, and therefore are asking all network news staff once again whether they wish to be considered for voluntary redundancy.\"</p> <p>Mitchell urged staff to register their interest in voluntary redundancy by 19 November.</p> <p>In the email, Mitchell said that network news would have some \"outstanding posts to close\" by 1 April 2013.</p> <p>A spokesman for the BBC confirmed that the outstanding posts did not mean additional job losses.</p> <p>Compulsory redundancies at the World Service led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/01/bbc-strike-world-service-cuts\" title=\"\">two walkouts</a> by staff last year.</p> <p>The BBC said the 73 post closures were a reduction on their original estimate of more than 100. A total of about 1,250 people work at the World Service worldwide.</p> <p>The National Union of Journalists has criticised the World Service cuts. General secretary Michelle Stanistreet said the job losses \"fly in the face\" of the corporation's commitment to quality programming, and urged director general George Entwistle to push for a renegotiation of the licence fee settlement.</p> <p>\"The World Service is a source of information for people across the world, described by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan as 'perhaps Britain's greatest gift to the world',\" Stanistreet added.</p> <p>\"[BBC global news director] Peter Horrocks says, in one breath, how audiences around the globe, particularly in the Arab world, increasingly rely on medium wave transmissions, yet in the next announces massive cuts in medium wave services being broadcast in Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan,\" she added.</p> <p>\"These cuts will severely impair the BBC's scope and services at a time when they are needed more than ever. The BBC needs to stop and rethink its approach to the World Service before it does irreparable damage.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Do you live on a major road? Or a side street in a leafy suburb? Either way, in most parts of Britain, that means you still have vehicles, cars and lorries rushing past your door at 30mph. If, in a moment's inattention you should step out in front of one, it will likely kill you.</p> <p>Actually, if you are an adult, and reasonably young, you're not so much at risk. Statistics show that it is the young and the old who are most in danger - and poorer people, who are more likely to be walking and more likely to live on busier roads. In Britain 24% of our road deaths are pedestrians - one of the highest percentages in Europe.</p> <p>The safety argument to reduce speed limits in places where people and cars interact is clear \u2013 if you need convincing, you can listen to the emergency responders and their experiences, particularly in having to treat child victims. But the benefits of 20mph limits go far beyond that.</p> <p>It is no coincidence that Britain is the most car-dependent nation in Europe, and the state with the biggest obesity problem. We need to greatly increase \"active transport\" - walking and cycling - for the good of our health and wellbeing, as well as to reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>We need to ensure that older people feel comfortable crossing the road, secure that cars will have time to see them, and that pedestrian lights allow them enough time to cross. That's the only way they can feel fully able to participate in their communities - with all of the benefits to health and wellbeing that brings.</p> <p>Parents need to feel that they can let their children walk or cycle to school and establish good exercise habits for life, as well as enjoy all the educational advantages of freely interacting with the natural and built environment around them.</p> <p>Even for drivers, there are significant advantages: reduced fuel consumption, less congestion, smoother traffic flow so less wear and tear on their vehicles.</p> <p>In light of these powerful arguments, 20mph zones are increasingly being imposed, planned or proposed in places like Blackpool, Plymouth, Uckfield and Chichester.</p> <p>But installing small, fragmented zones across the country does take funds for signage and road markings, for road design \u2013 and that's often a factor preventing or delaying their implementation.</p> <p>Drivers may, sometimes rightly, argue confusion, while police plead lack of resources for enforcement. And each individual zone usually involves a campaign, a lot of time and energy - good for the community, but time and energy that could be used for other productive purposes.</p> <p>Furthermore, many of the zones installed thus far are in residential areas, but main roads with heavy pedestrian footfall suffer higher collision rates than residential side roads, so that's where 20mph can make the biggest difference.</p> <p>People living in villages bisected by main roads have to suffer the danger, noise and inconvenience of fast flowing traffic, but they're no physically tougher than the rest of us \u2013 nor do they have faster reaction speeds to skip between the speedsters.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19999762\" title=\"\">London borough of Islington is leading the way</a> in showing an alternative approach: a blanket 20mph limit across all of the roads that it controls. The Labour council deserves credit for standing up to police resistance to bring in 20mph on major as well as residential roads. Now it is over to Transport for London, which controls a few remaining major routes, to do the right thing and apply the limit.</p> <p>When that happens \u2013 and it surely is a \"when\" not an \"if\" \u2013 the only signage needed will be on the borough boundaries, with occasional reminders.</p> <p>Islington has made a start, but surely, with 8.4 million people across Britain now covered by 20mph standard speed limits, it's time to think bigger. Local individual campaigns can and should continue - it is all part of the pressure - but it is time to say that safe, pleasant roads designed for people and communities \u2013 not cars \u2013 should be the norm everywhere people live, work and shop.</p> <p>Make 20mph the default in built-up areas, and the need for extensive signage \u2013 the excuse for police to say that enforcement is too difficult, and a chance for drivers to claim they were confused by varying limits \u2013 is done away with.</p> <p>We'd get streets all around the country on which the young, the old, all of us could feel much safer, streets we were more inclined to use as pedestrians and as cyclists, pavements that felt more comfortable as a place to stop to catch up with our neighbours. We'd have started to reclaim our streets.</p>",
  "<p>Four years ago, eLearning entrepreneur Steve Dineen had one of those rare, lightening-bolt moments. Fuel, his company, was running along just fine. It had grown into the second largest provider of online training in Europe, with blue-chip clients around the world.</p> <p>Then Dineen undertook an informal poll of his workforce. Of his 200 or so employees, he couldn't find a single one who admitted to using his training modules in their free time.</p> <p>\"The company was perfectly profitable, but what became apparent was that people were not choosing to learn using this traditional eLearning model. The only place you'll find traditional eLearning courses is in your corporate life, never at home\" he explains.</p> <p>Dineen decided to go back to the drawing board. His mission was clear: find a way to digitise the best teachers in the world and provide access to anyone, anywhere \u2013 for free. The result is a new social enterprise, <a href=\"http://www.fusion-universal.com/\" title=\"\">Fusion Universal</a>, and what Dineen calls a global \"virtual school\".</p> <p>eLearning is not new. Educators have seen the potential to market expert knowledge online through the use of the latest information technology. Intel has its <a href=\"http://www.skoool.com/\" title=\"\">Skool programme</a>, Microsoft's <a href=\"http://business.microsoftelearning.com/\" title=\"\">e-learning business</a>, and Cisco's <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/netacad/index.html\" title=\"\">Network Academy</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Fusing business and education</strong></h2> <p>Dineen ran the numbers. He realised that to achieve his goal by traditional means \u2013 what he describes as a \"Hollywood-style process\" of designing, producing and (re)editing multimedia content \u2013 would take about six years and require around \u00a330m.</p> <p>So he turned everything up on its head. He cut the online material to bite size chunks. Each session now lasts two to four minutes each, and he bypassed <a href=\"http://scorm.com/\" title=\"\">Scorm</a>, the cumbersome industry standard designed to bring conformity and compliance to e-learning management systems.</p> <p>Instead, he adopted a Cloud-based approach based on collaborative content production. In additional to a new technological approach, the system relied on an alternative approach to content provision. In short, he persuaded the best schoolteachers to offer their time for free. In exchange, their schools gain access to the resulting eLearning materials. Eight of the top 10 UK teaching schools are now on board.</p> <p>All the sessions can be accessed on mobile devices or computers via YouTube, with additional supporting materials available through a free web-based platform called Fuse.</p> <p>The London-based company has developed around half of the 15,000 bite-size course it believes are necessary to cover a secondary education syllabus. Full roll-out is expected early next year.</p> <p>In the long-term, Dineen and his partners plan to finance the service through advertising revenue and one-on-one online tutoring. That model still stands. For the moment, however, Fusion Universal has struck on a rich seam of alternative revenue: corporate cash.</p> <p>\"When companies began to hear what we were doing in terms of digitising the best teaching available and making it available to everyone, they began asking us if they could capture their own internal expertise in a similar way\", says Dineen.</p> <p>BT, Panasonic, Virgin Media, Lloyds and Bupa are among the 40 or so corporations to have sought its services since the beginning of the year. The flexibility and ease of use is one of the cloud based platform's main selling points. \"The idea is to give staff the ability to capture and share expertise instantly making that accessible at the point of need, rather than asking the person to the left or right of you when you're stuck.\"</p> <p>The notion of using the same technology to deliver a profitable business service and a free education service is \"very exciting\", says Nic Laycock, managing director of training advisory firm Amos Laycock Consulting. \"Fusion's corporate clients are aware that the profits from this service are going directly to support education projects in the developing world.\"</p> <p>Lloyds Bank is one of those currently piloting the new approach. The UK-based bank hopes that by shifting training and information-sharing sessions online, it can cut meetings by a fifth. Instead of sitting around a table all together, employees can access the same material from their desks and comment on it as necessary.</p> <p>Less time in meetings means more time on revenue-generating activities. It also translates to fewer miles travelled, which has knock-on environmental benefits.</p> <h2><strong>Disruptive learning</strong></h2> <p>Another small company looking to disrupt the e-learning market is Brighton-based <a href=\"http://www.brightwave.co.uk/livetime-learning/\" title=\"\">LiveTime Learning</a>. Its founder, Matthew Turner, also spent many years in the conventional online training market.</p> <p>Most e-learning is 'asynchronous', he says. \"You'll typically do it on your PC or laptop or smartphone, and you'll be learning a particular skill.\" The direction of learning is one-way: the teacher teaches, while you \u2013 the learner \u2013 sit and listen.</p> <p>Turner has come up with a 'synchronous' approach whereby lessons occur in a virtual environment that is both collective and interactive. The sessions run three times a day, last around 20 minutes each and are accessible via Adobe Connect from anywhere in the world \u2013 just as long as users have internet access.</p> <p>The subject matter deviates from the norm too. Rather than the technical or academic material that dominates most eLearning services, LiveTime focuses on 'soft skills' such as leadership and project management.</p> <p>The firm's clients include multinationals like BP, Hitachi and Tata Steel. The ability to deliver consistent training throughout the world appeals to such companies. So too does LiveTime's flexibility. Corporate employees are often obliged to cover compulsory courses, but beyond that they can pick and choose from a list of around 120 sessions.</p> <p>\"When we looked at the usage of our multinational clients, what we found was that it's much higher among developing world \u2026 I've a strong suspicion that's because they have less access to training, when they get that opportunity they lap it up\", says Turner.</p> <p>So great is the demand in India, for example, that users regularly hook up their PCs to a loudspeaker and invite 10 or 15 friends to share the session with them.</p> <p>\"Then they discuss it and talk about how they'll put the training into practice\", Turner says. \"They are potentially using a lot fewer licenses than they technically should be, but I don't really mind so much because that's really applying eLearning.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Plans to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing appear to be on the rocks after figures showed activity in the sector contracted for the sixth straight month in October.</p> <p>The CIPS/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.5 from a downwardly revised 48.1 in September, dipping further below the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.</p> <p>The downturn worsened as companies received fewer orders and costs rose at a faster pace than in September, forcing firms to cut jobs and scale back investment plans.</p> <p>News that manufacturers are continuing to cut production will sound alarm bells in the Treasury and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which have argued for a shift in policy towards creating the conditions that favour industrial production.</p> <p>The Treasury is also concerned that a weaker manufacturing sector will drag the economy back into the third recession in four years when official figures for GDP in the fourth quarter are published early next year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/25/uk-emerges-from-double-dip-recession-george-osborne\" title=\"\">UK has just emerged from its second recession since the financial crash</a> following a 1% rise in national income in the third quarter. But economists put most of the rise down to one-off factors and many have predicted another period of contraction as the slowdown in global growth and government austerity measures take their toll.</p> <p>The October figure is below economists' forecasts of 48.0 and may throw the debate about the chances of more stimulus from the Bank of England open again.</p> <p>Several economists changed their view following strong economic growth of 1% in the third quarter, expecting no extension of the BoE's government bond purchases at next week's policy meeting.</p> <p>But manufacturers cut production for a fourth month in a row and new orders fell at a faster rate than in September as export demand dwindled, the PMI data showed.</p> <p>Markit economist Rob Dobson said: \"While the road to an export-led recovery is still blocked by the ongoing difficulties in the eurozone, it is concerning to hear further reports of the global slowdown hurting trade with other regions such as Asia.\" The index for new orders fell to 47.7 in October from 49.9 in the previous month.</p> <p>The report said that signs of spare capacity encouraged some manufacturers to reduce employment, mainly in reaction to a fall in the backlog of work. Alarmingly, backlogs of work fell for the twenty-first consecutive month in October, with the rate of contraction sharper than the long run average for the PMI series.</p> <p>\"Manufacturers remained cost-cautious overall, leading to lower levels of purchasing and further depletion of inventory holdings. The rate of reduction in input buying volumes accelerated sharply and was one of the fastest signalled during the past three-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, margins were squeezed further, as cost inflation hit a seven-month peak at a time when pricing power remained muted,\" the report said.</p> <p>The only comfort for the government is that most other European countries have suffered a downturn manufacturing output. Figures for Sweden on Thursday showed the Nordic country's manufacturing PMI fell to 43.1.</p> <p>Dobson also noted some positive signs. \"The consumer goods sector bounced back robustly in October to really buck the wider trend,\" he said. \"This chimes with ongoing signs that domestic retail sales volumes are holding up reasonably well.\"</p> <p>Business lobby CBI raised its forecast slightly for this year and next on Thursday after the bounce in the third quarter, predicting a stagnation in 2012 and 1.4 percent growth in 2013.</p> <p>Bank of England policymakers have cautioned that the strong growth from the third quarter was unlikely to be repeated.</p> <p>In a worrying sign for the central bankers, companies' costs rose at the fastest pace since March. Firms also increased their prices at a much slower rate, squeezing profit margins.</p>",
  "<p>'Data as culture' is a phrase new to many, but its roots will be familiar. We live in an age of data-driven decision-making: decisions that impact every aspect of our lives.</p> <p>Whether it's the prime minister reviewing data about our economic growth, or your sister checking your <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/\" title=\"\">FourSquare</a> check-ins, data is ubiquitous and pervasive.</p> <p>Since the early days of the internet, and the web, we have seen more data becoming available. Mobile phones, smart meters and sensors, store cards, and social media are all generating data that simply didn't exist before. This is in addition to the huge amounts of information that already exists; health records, transport routes, maps, spending information, are now all digital \u2013 but rarely accessible.</p> <p>Open data does not mean 'all data', or that it's a free-for-all. For example, your personal health data is extremely private. There are benefits to access: for example aggregated anonymous statistical analysis can help us make better decisions. There are also risks \u2013 we know that companies, governments, and individuals are not always well equipped to handle information in the most appropriate ways. We also face challenges of transparency. We need to be clear on whose data we are using and how it is being used: 'provenance' or 'traceability' needs to form part of our data literacy. If a minister is making a data-driven decision about our economy, I'd certainly like to know their sources.</p> <p>Simultaneously, we now face new challenges that need different kinds of innovation, collaboration, and engagement. From environmental threats such as climate change and energy security, to social equity, and economic prosperity, we now live in an age where accurate information not only guides our decisions but the ability to examine the systems impact are crucial. For example, solving one issue, such as energy security, with the wrong solution will have devastating impacts on our environment, and such impacts will in-turn have devastating impacts on our economic and social well-being. The availability of data is crucial to collaboration, the development of novel solutions to problems, and to monitoring their impacts.</p> <p>We face three systems' challenges in the creation of a new ecosystem around data and information: supply, enablement, and demand.</p> <p>Founded by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt, <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/\" title=\"\">the Open Data Institute (ODI)</a> has been created to help address these challenges.</p> <p>Since assuming the role of chief executive officer in October at the ODI, I have been struck by the ubiquitous enthusiasm, and momentum building around this emerging domain.</p> <p>It's not just the Googles and Facebooks of the world who understand the potential in the system, although they have helped to trailblaze the path. UK government (cross-party) has helped lead public-sector engagement, and I have been encouraged by the government's desire for transparency and open data. Large corporates, start-ups, investors, NGOs, hackers, and citizens; all have interests in unlocking data, for many purposes.</p> <p>This places the ODI in an amazing position. As a non-profit, non-partisan organisation, we can help to shape the landscape. First, we have to facilitate supply: providing 'plumbing-like' processes and technology standards. Second, we need to make sure they are used: this means training people on what open data means, how to use it, and why it is valuable. Finally, we need to demonstrate value: nurturing organisations, new and old, to deliver positive change.</p> <p>Much of the rhetoric around 'value creation' falls short, in my view, of an adequate definition of 'value'. We have therefore, begun, by defining three focal points for our lens on value: social, environmental, and economic.</p> <p>To scale our efforts, we will also help mentors: training influencers within organisations, and creating experts that can empower others to unlock benefits from data.</p> <p>Critically, we have to focus on information that is useful. 'Build it and they will come' is not a good foundation for any movement. As <a href=\"http://archive.dconstruct.org/2012/admiralshovel\" title=\"\">James Burke</a> has noted, \"information causes change, otherwise it's not information\" .</p> <p>We are therefore in the process of creating a culture of experimentation, to explore and discover what works, what is useful, what is surprising, and what may lead to unexpected results. Continuous experimentation also allows for failure \u2013 without it success is impossible. &#xa0;In addition, there are some obvious areas, such as ensuring existing data is published in a structured, reliable, and traceable form \u2013 that will help us all access the data we need to make credible, informed decisions.</p> <p>We are off to a flying start: \u00a310m in seed-funding from the Technology Strategy Board, a 5,000sq ft space in Shoreditch, a post-graduate diploma in open data ready to go, a corporate membership model, our <a href=\"http://www.mastodonc.com/\" title=\"\">first start-up</a> in-situ, a number of hack-days, including seed invention events such as <a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/events/hack4health-2012\" title=\"\">Hack4Health</a>, and our first public call: for<a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/odi-embraces-data-culture-art-commission\" title=\"\"> data-driven artworks</a>, to state clearly why data-as-culture is at the heart of our thinking.</p> <p><em>Gavin Starks is the chief executive officer of </em><a href=\"http://www.theodi.org/\" title=\"\"><em>the Open Data Institute</em></a><em> @ukODI</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\"><em>public leaders network</em></a><em>, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

Since coming to power, Africa's first elected female leader has stabilised the economy. Foreign debt has been virtually wiped out and Liberia has enjoyed annual growth rates of 6.5% for the past six years. Johnson Sirleaf hopes Liberia will be free from aid dependence in 10 years' time and achieve middle-income status by 2030.</p> <p>Notwithstanding her achievements, Johnson Sirleaf has recently come under fire for nepotism, having appointed three of her sons to top government posts, although one of them, Charles, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19333908\" title=\"\">has been suspended as deputy governor of the central bank</a> for failing to declare his assets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/10/former-ally-ellen-johnson-sirleaf\" title=\"\">This month, Leymah Gbowee, a Liberian activist and joint winner with Johnson Sirleaf of last year's Nobel peace prize, resigned from the country's peace and reconciliation commission</a>, criticising the president's decision to appoint her three sons to senior positions. Gbowee also criticised Johnson Sirleaf for not doing enough to address poverty.</p> <p>While acknowledging that corruption is a problem in Liberia, Johnson Sirleaf said defiantly: \"I challenge anyone who says it's with me or my family. We have a very vibrant society, a society that's full of rumours and innuendoes \u2026 Now I have to put [people] in certain places where I get the best results based upon talent, based upon competence and based upon integrity, and that's what I do. I stand the test and I challenge anyone who says there are other motives. I stand by my record and stand by the record of my family very firmly.\"</p> <p>On Gbowee's resignation, Johnson Sirleaf, who spoke as a guest of the <a href=\"http://www.royalafricansociety.org/\" title=\"\">Royal African Society</a>, said her fellow Nobel laureate was too young to know what Liberia had been through to achieve peace. \"We respect her decision,\" said Johnson Sirleaf. \"We suspect she will change her mind \u2026 we'll need all our talent.\"</p> <p>On another contentious issue, the president said the government was aware of complaints that foreign companies had taken advantage of local communities in pursuit of land deals. Liberia is seeking to attract foreign investors that can develop its rich natural resources \u2013 gold, iron ore and agricultural land. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/21/opinion/in-liberia-a-nobel-laureates-problem.html\" title=\"\">According to Liberian campaigners, Johnson Sirleaf's government granted more than a third of Liberia's land to private investors for logging, mining and agro-industrial enterprises between 2006 and 2011</a>. More than 2.8m hectares (7m acres) have become forestry and agricultural concessions. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/feb/29/liberia-land-deals-could-seed-conflict\" title=\"\">Land deals with the Malaysian corporation Sime Darby</a> for the production of palm oil have been particularly divisive, with about 150,000 people directly affected in the first five years of plantation development.</p> <p>The president said her government is reviewing land concessions and, where there had been unfair agreements, land would be returned to the community. But activists say this is mere window dressing and that the problem of unfair land deals is a direct result of the absence of a clear land tenure policy. \"The government recognised the problems, placed a moratorium on the sale of public land and established the land commission to come up with policies regarding land,\" said Robert Nyahn, programme manager of <a href=\"http://oecdwatch.org/organisations-en/samfu-save-my-future-foundation\" title=\"\">Save My Future Foundation, a Liberian NGO that monitors foreign companies in the extractive sector</a>.</p> <p>\"While the policy is not yet developed by the land commission, the government contradicts itself by granting large concessions for forestry, mining and agriculture on what it claims to be public land \u2026 the same public land \u2026 while people's right to land, especially customary ownership, is still in question. These concessions are granted by government without consultation with communities who live on the land granted as concession. When communities start to raise the issues, the government pretends it will review the concession agreements,\" Nyahn added.</p> <p>Johnson Sirleaf was speaking at a business breakfast in London. The Liberian leader is one of three co-chairs of the high-level panel deciding what should come after the millennium development goals (MDGs) along with David Cameron, the UK prime minister, and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the Indonesian president. Johnson Sirleaf said three years remained to meet the eight MDGs and she wanted to see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/31/millennium-development-goals-key-datasets\" title=\"\">a big push to meet those off-track</a>. \"The post-2015 agenda has to build on the MDGs, but peace has to be fundamental,\" she said. \"Without it, it is hard to achieve other goals.\"</p>",
  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.ref.ac.uk/timetable/\" title=\"\">the 2014 REF deadline</a> looming and job search committees eyeing up ways of banking a few more high quality REF-ables, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the pressure to produce. As an early career researcher this is particularly the case \u2013 you know what prospective departments are looking for. But despite increasing advances in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/open-access\" title=\"\">open access publishing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/19/peer-review-research-impact-altmetrics\" title=\"\">peer-review</a>, getting published still takes considerable time and personal commitment. <a href=\"http://www.phd2published.com/2012/10/15/announcing-acwrimo/\" title=\"\">Academic Writing Month</a> (AcWriMo) may therefore seem like impeccable timing or a bid to push already overworked academics over the edge.</p> <p>Inspired by <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/\" title=\"\">National Novel Writing Month</a>, a challenge to write 50,000 words of fiction in a month, <a href=\"http://digitalcritic.org/\" title=\"\">Charlotte Frost</a> (then a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href=\"http://www4.uwm.edu/\" title=\"\">University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee</a>) set herself a similar task in 2011 for her own academic writing. Using <a href=\"http://www.phd2published.com/\" title=\"\">PhD2Published</a>, the publishing resource she had set up the previous year, she then extended the invitation world-wide.</p> <p>Within a few weeks more than a hundred people had signed up to join what she called AcBoWriMo (Academic Book Writing Month). Over the month of November they all shared tips about academic writing and encouraged each other to meet their goals using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23acbowrimo&amp;src=hash\" title=\"\">#acbowrimo</a> on Twitter and through various other social media platforms. During this period, Frost also received criticism for promoting quantity over quality and for feeding the fast culture of academia.</p> <p>But this misses the point: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jul/25/the-art-of-academic-writing\" title=\"\">academic writing is a problem</a>. It's a problem because it is still the primary way we share our research and gain esteem. It's a problem because the long-form writing we have to do as PhD students can feel more like purgatory than an apprenticeship. And it's a problem because few of us start our careers with positive attitudes to writing or having established a regular and sustainable writing practice.</p> <p>During the first run of the initiative, a powerful support community emerged <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/2012/oct/02/global-researcher-professional-development-advice\" title=\"\">for academics with global reach</a>. People discovered a safe place to talk about their writing woes and to discover new ways of working. It proved so positive that participants kept the channel of discussion alive with a permanent twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23acwri\" title=\"\">#AcWri</a> and as managing editor of PhD2Published, I have partnered with Jeremy Segrott of Cardiff University to host <a href=\"http://www.phd2published.com/acwri-2/live-twitter-discussion/about/\" title=\"\">a regular live discussion</a> on all things academic writing. Jennifer Lim in Malaysia and Wini Cooke in Australia have joined us to ensure we cater for a variety of academic cultures and time zones.</p> <p>Together we found that large numbers of academics lacked confidence in their approach to writing and held quite negative perspectives on the issue. But through the fortnightly live chats (which mimic the formula of other successful Twitter-based discussions like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23phdchat\" title=\"\">#PhDchat</a>) we witnessed a tide of change. Just getting problems out in the open is a start, and by talking about why and how we write, academics can find a process that suits them \u2013 fast, slow or a mixture. In reflecting on our issues, the pressure to 'publish or perish' tends to ease.</p> <p>This year's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23acwrimo\" title=\"\">#AcWriMo</a> has dropped the book aspect to allow more people to get involved and ensure that tweeted content shows up in the regular #AcWri stream. Approaching the initiative as a diagnostic tool, Charlotte has set out six key rules:</p> <p>\u2022 Decide on a goal that's word, time or task based (and stretches you)</p> <p>\u2022 Publicly declare said goal (this gives you a push from the start)</p> <p>\u2022 Draft a strategy (planning in advance will focus you)</p> <p>\u2022 Openly discuss your problems and progress</p> <p>\u2022 Don't slack off</p> <p>\u2022 Declare your results at the end</p> <p>This process provides an opportunity to think through how much (quality) writing you can get done which previously you might not have achieved. You can also identify your own obstacles and find solutions, all with the support of an online community (350 participants and counting). And as <a href=\"http://thesiswhisperer.com/\" title=\"\">the Thesis Whisperer</a>, aka Inger Mewburn from the University of Melbourne, points out, it's just for one month \u2013 one month to work out your academic writing future.</p> <p>Those who suggest this dedicated month of writing encourages hyper-productivity miss another important phenomenon illustrated by the wider #AcWri movement. Dubbed variously as 'feral' and 'outstitutional' education, these public scholarship projects are growing at a rapid pace. Social media platforms offer a great hybrid space \u2013 somewhere between the formal institution we're affiliated to and the comfort of our own homes \u2013 where we can think out loud, ask for advice, build a support network, write and research collaboratively.</p> <p>Such initiatives will be discussed at an upcoming session, 'Social media as higher education pedagogy', at the <a href=\"http://www.srhe.ac.uk/conference2012/index.asp\" title=\"\">Society for Research into Higher Education Conference 2012</a>. We want to reflect on how the internet promotes new ways of being an open source academic; how blogging, tweeting and social networking sites offer us an unprecedented opportunity to cut through the myths of higher education and talk freely about what we do.</p> <p>Personally, I'm hoping to communicate the value of my hands-on experience within one of these powerful communities and how it augments my research practice and inspires me to think and work differently. Far from adding to the pressure to publish, ventures like #AcWriMo offer me a chance to stop and reflect upon what it is I do and how I might do it better.</p> <p><em>Anna Tarrant is a research Associate in the faculty of Health and Social Care at the Open University and managing editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.phd2published.com\" title=\"\"><em>PhD2Published</em></a><em> \u2013 follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/dratarrant\" title=\"\"><em>@dratarrant</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://dratarrant.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><em>visit her blog </em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The battle raging at the heart of the UK's energy and climate policy has taken another dramatic turn. The new Conservative energy minister, John Hayes, has gone on a rampage against the government's renewables policy \u2013 airing his <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/9644558/Death-knell-for-wind-farms-Enough-is-Enough-says-minister.html\" title=\"\">anti-windfarm views</a> in the press and setting himself on a collision course with the Liberal Democrat-run department tasked with delivering a secure and sustainable energy future.</p> <p>The energy secretary, Ed Davey, has responded by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">confirming there will be no policy change</a>, reaffirming the target of 30% of UK electricity from renewables by 2020. But it's astonishing that he has allowed the minister to keep responsibility for delivering this policy.</p> <p>Hayes's swivel-eyed exclamations that \"enough is enough\" \u2013 painting a frankly unrecognisable picture of windfarms spreading like wildfire through the countryside \u2013 represent the latest intervention <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-16893018\" title=\"\">in a co-ordinated campaign</a> by an anti-renewables lobby with vested interests in propping up the declining fossil fuel industries. They peddle a number of myths \u2013 on effectiveness, cost and public opinion \u2013 which must be challenged.</p> <p>The UK has some of the best wind resources in the world, with onshore wind already playing a lead role in renewable electricity generation. Our wind turbines <a href=\"http://www.bwea.com/energy/rely.html\" title=\"\">produce electricity 70-85% of the time</a>, last year generating enough for more than 3.5m homes. A single turbine generates enough power to cover more than 1,000 homes in a year.</p> <p>The environmental case is clear: windfarms are estimated to save around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/26/myth-wind-turbines-carbon-emissions\" title=\"\">6.1m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> over the course of a year \u2013 about 4% of UK emissions from electricity. DECC's own figures show that onshore wind <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/wind/onshore/delivering/why_onshore/why_onshore.aspx\" title=\"\">is one of the cheapest renewable technologies we have</a>. At a time when fossil fuel prices are rising, the costs of onshore wind are falling \u2013 already making it possible for the government to reduce the subsidy.</p> <p>Attempts to blame recent energy bill rises on support for onshore wind and other renewables have already been demolished. From <a href=\"http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Media/FactSheets/Documents1/Why%20are%20energy%20prices%20rising_factsheet_108.pdf\" title=\"\">Ofgem</a> and the committee on climate change, we know that the rise in wholesale gas prices has been the primary culprit when it comes to bill rises \u2013 not subsidies for renewables. For some, however, the onshore wind debate is driven more by aesthetics than numbers.</p> <p>Whether you believe that wind turbines are an attractive addition to the landscape or a hideous blemish on this green and pleasant land is a personal matter. But while Hayes and the Daily Telegraph would have you believe that the public is fighting tooth-and-nail against onshore wind, polls have indicated that the majority of people are in favour of wind energy. A <a href=\"http://www.smartenergyjournal.com/2012/10/23/uk-public-want-more-wind-farms-according-to-yougov-poll/\" title=\"\">YouGov poll</a> for the Sunday Times found that 69% of the public want the current level of wind increased or maintained. Only 17% of people support more gas and coal power stations, while less than a third back shale gas.</p> <p>That's not to say that wind developments are always welcomed with open arms. I agree with Hayes that windfarms shouldn't be imposed on communities. We need a far better process of community engagement to make sure all concerns are properly listened to. Importantly, when communities feel like they have a stake in these projects, support for wind becomes even greater. <a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.com/community-owned-renewable-energy\" title=\"\">According to an ICM poll</a>, 49% of people would support a wind turbine within two miles of their home, but if the project were community-owned, support rose to 68% and opposition plummeted to 7%.</p> <p>In Germany, where 65% of its renewable energy capacity is community-owned, opposition to wind is much rarer. So if the government is serious about creating a secure, home-grown energy supply and a new generation of green jobs, it must recognise the flaws in the upcoming energy bill that could make our energy system an even more hostile environment for community projects.</p> <p>Ed Davey says the right things on community ownership. Even the Conservatives in their <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/news/news_stories/2010/04/~/media/Files/Downloadable%20Files/Manifesto/Quality%20of%20Life%20Agenda.ashx\" title=\"\">2010 manifesto</a> said: \"We believe in allowing communities to be active participants in, as well as beneficiaries of, onshore wind development.\" Yet the policies simply aren't there.</p> <p>For a start, the government should ditch its impossibly complicated contracts for difference in favour of fixed feed-in-tariffs \u2013 the most cost-effective policy for deploying renewable power. The government also needs to be honest about the energy choices on the table. If Hayes chose to back a shale gas revolution, would he really expect communities to choose a local fracking station over a windfarm? And would consumers be willing to pay the price for a <a href=\"http://s0.2mdn.net/3786356/bgwelcomepage.html?rfp=http://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2216974/business-bosses-attack-george-osbornes-policy-of-dash-for-gas\" title=\"\">new dash for gas</a>? Because not only would more unabated gas be incompatible with our carbon targets, more exposure to volatile gas prices would be bad news for those already struggling to pay their energy bills.</p> <p>At this turning point in the UK's energy policy, the potential for onshore and offshore wind to create jobs, improve energy security and reduce emissions cannot be ignored. And communities must be able to benefit from this. So rather than allowing ministers to peddle anti-wind propaganda, Cameron must confirm his support for renewables in no uncertain terms \u2013 and decide if Hayes has a future in the energy department at all.</p>",
  "<p>House prices in the UK jumped by 0.6% in October, more than offsetting the previous month's 0.4% fall and bringing the average cost of a property to \u00a3164,153, according to Nationwide building society.</p> <p>The lender's monthly house price index showed prices were down 0.9% year-on-year, but the three-month figure moved into positive territory for the first time since January and showed a 0.5% rise.</p> <p>Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, said while monthly figures had failed to show any strong trend, with three months of rises and three months of falls since May, the annual rate of change showed \"a picture of relative stability\".</p> <p>However, Gardner said that while the UK had exited recession this month, continued problems in the eurozone and the US would hold back exports, meaning a sudden rise in house prices was unlikely.</p> <p>\"Although the UK economy has been adding jobs in recent quarters, even in the midst of recession, conditions remain very difficult for households,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Wage growth is still not keeping up with the cost of living and unemployment is still well above normal levels. This helps to explain why housing market activity has remained subdued, with the number of mortgage approvals still running at little more than half their long-run average.\"</p> <p>Nationwide's figures are based on mortgages it has approved over the month. Borrowing remains sluggish, despite the government's efforts to boost the number of loans available by offering banks and building societies cheap funds through the Funding for Lending scheme.</p> <p>Figures from the Bank of England show a total of 50,024 house purchase loans were approved in September, compared to a long-term average of more than 80,000 a month.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, had been predicting a 3% fall in house prices over the course of 2012. Following Nationwide's latest figures, however, he said: \"The chances are rising that house prices will essentially stabilise over the coming months, although the risks are still slanted to the downside and any significant turnaround in house prices still looks some way off.\"</p> <p>Property buying agent Gabby Adler said: \"The autumn market has been slower than expected with fewer new properties coming up for sale, so transactions remain at low levels. Prices remain fairly flat and bumping along, as they have throughout the year.\"</p> <p>Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, added: \"Increased loan availability, better rates as a result of Funding for Lending and increased confidence among buyers as we emerge from the double-dip recession all have a part to play in contributing to a slightly more positive picture for the housing and mortgage markets. What is still required is cheaper mortgages at higher loan-to-values.\"</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.surveymonkey.com\" title=\"\">SurveyMonkey</a> is a great tool, but I sometimes wonder if monkeys are putting together the headlines on some sustainability surveys. <strong> </strong></p> <p>A couple of recent examples: Deloitte claims that chief financial officers (CFOs) <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GX/global/insights/focus-on-the-issues/367d2dd9cc9b9310VgnVCM2000001b56f00aRCRD.htm\" title=\"\">see sustainability \"as a key driver of financial performance\"</a>. This view is based on the officers of 250 companies in 14 countries with more than a billion dollars in revenues. But if they really believed that, the business world would be undergoing the huge transformation we need to achieve sustainability.</p> <p>Some people obviously believe this is happening, <a href=\"http://www.edie.net/sustainability_report/business_leaders_sustainability.asp\" title=\"\">because another survey</a> recently asked: \"Why are business leaders prioritising sustainability?\"</p> <p>However, the question doesn't actually fit the facts. This UK survey actually found that only half of the biggest companies with sustainability policies in place see it as explicitly part of their value creation. Similarly, what Deloitte actually found was that just under half of their 250 CFOs believe \"there is a strong link between sustainability performance and financial performance\". Not quite the \"key driver\" of the headline writing monkey.</p> <p>Another piece of research, <a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/Pages/global500.aspx\" title=\"\">this time from the Carbon Disclosure Project</a> (CDP) is more like it. Summing up the results from its Global 500 report, CDP concludes: \"Few are setting the necessary targets or making the investments required\".</p> <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers, which worked on the report with CDP, reckons that we need to reduce absolute emissions by around 4% every year from 2020 to 2050 if the world is to avoid temperature increases above the two degrees that is considered not too disastrous. The world's leading companies, responding to the CDP survey, are nowhere near that level of ambition.</p> <p>Most don't have absolute targets at all. Instead they target \"normalised\" reductions, relative to sales or some other measure of activity. Most don't have long-term targets (beyond 2020). And even those leaders that do have a long-term target are aiming for a 1% reduction per year instead of the 4% needed.</p> <p>Congratulations, then, to the 33 companies that qualify for the CDP's Leadership Index based on performance. And perhaps especially to the eight that made it into the index for the third consecutive year: Bank of America, Bank of Montreal, BMW, BASF, Bayer, National Australia Bank, UBS, and Westpac.</p> <p>On the other hand, this list gives the game away. Five of the eight are banks. For them, cutting carbon means saving energy and switching to renewables in their buildings. Not difficult technically and not hard to justify financially. But <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/blog/banking-sustainability-financial-sector?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">as I wrote here last time</a> a sustainable bank would be reducing emissions from their lending and investment activities, not just their buildings.</p> <p>The CDP report also provides some clues to why more companies are not taking emissions reductions seriously enough. First, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/08/firms-tories-2030-carbon-target?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">as 50 companies recently told the UK government</a>, clear regulation is essential to reduce the uncertainty around energy and climate policy. But more significantly, one of the things that distinguishes the Leadership Index companies is their willingness to accept longer payback periods for emission-reducing investments.</p> <p>Short-termism is the culprit. It explains why, contrary to the survey headlines above, most business leaders are not prioritising sustainability and most CFOs do not see sustainability as a key driver of financial performance. They will not do so unless they lift their eyes beyond the short-term horizon that restricts most major companies' financial decisions.</p> <p>This brings the focus back to the CDP, which is backed by investors controlling assets worth $78tn (\u00a348tn). If you consider that Apple and Exxon-Mobil (the world's two biggest companies) together are worth about $1 tn (\u00a3622bn), that shows you how powerful these investors are. They own the Global 500. But despite their backing for the CDP, they are not seriously telling companies to take climate change more seriously.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ipe.com/pfpr/\" title=\"\">Here's another survey</a> that demonstrates this sad truth: pension funds (owning much of that $78 trillion) choose asset managers to look after their money based primarily on their perceived ability to deliver returns and report effectively. \"ESG [environmental, social and governance] and engagement issues were among the least highly ranked\".</p> <p>CDP has done a great job of shedding light on business emissions. Now its backers in the financial world need to apply pressure so that business leaders really do prioritise sustainability and CFOs really do see it as a key driver of their bonuses.</p> <p><em>Roger Cowe is a writer and consultant on corporate sustainability </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\" title=\"\">\"Enough is enough\"</a> says Conservative energy minister John Hayes about the building of onshore windfarms in Britain. It makes you wonder where else in energy policy he might consider enough to be enough: the accumulation of hazardous, long-term radioactive waste from nuclear power, for example, or the build-up of life-threatening greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels?</p> <p>Why pick on wind, and in particular, now, is it really such a threat? No country has yet been invaded to annex its windfarms, and no terrorists or foreign powers are known to be fiendishly acquiring wind turbine technology with which to hold the world to ransom.</p> <p>Hayes' intervention raises eyebrows for several reasons. Timing is one. Attacking renewable energy, which is part of the answer to solving climate change, just as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/31/superstorm-sandy-cleanup-live\" title=\"\">a massive extreme weather event</a> \u2013 the kind set to worsen in a warming world \u2013 is ripping through north America leaving carnage in its wake, amounts at best to questionable political judgment.</p> <p>A much worse, perhaps unpardonable sin, for a Conservative minister is to demonstrate ignorance of your own nation's rich heritage. His ire is raised against the possibility of 4,000 new wind turbines being \"allowed to spread\" through the country and be \"imposed on communities\". This he sees as a shocking attack of the new from the \"bourgeois left\". But, for someone of Hayes' political persuasion, one which prides itself on a sense of history and tradition, he seems unaware that as long ago as the seventeenth century an estimated 90,000 windmills quietly turned up across the landscape of Britain.</p> <p>It's a matter of taste, of course, but I find the aerodynamic elegance of a modern wind turbine rather more attractive than ubiquitous giant meccano of electricity pylons which march about the country without apparent complaint from the energy minister. I wonder if his concern about things being \"imposed\" on communities stretches back to Conservative transport and planning policy that saw roads carve through countryside and out-of-town superstores kill high streets?</p> <p>Hayes is, of course, another example of a broader, creeping retreat from reason on energy policy that includes <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/25/green-campaigners-condemn-peter-lilley\" title=\"\">the appointment of Peter Lilley MP</a> \u2013 an oil company executive and global warming sceptic \u2013 to the select committee on climate change and energy, and the new environment secretary himself, Owen Paterson.</p> <p>Their antipathy toward the economic potential of environmental action seems cruelly to deny Britain a vital route out of its industrial torpor, not to mention the chance of building real energy security, and creating countless job opportunities by cashing in on the fact that, according to Deutsche Bank, pound for pound of investment, energy efficiency and renewable technologies deliver anywhere between two- and four-times the number of jobs compared to the old, conventional energy sources.</p> <p>A week ago I spoke at a conference to launch a national initiative on the transition to a low-carbon economy in the Belgian city of Ghent. A few hundred tickets had been sold in the run up to the event, and then, suddenly, it sold out with hundreds turned away by the box office. What happened? Just days before came news that the Ford motor works in Genk was going to close. More than 10,000 jobs depended on it. A speech, more properly a eulogy, that was made in Belgian parliament by a young MP left hardened politicians and commentators in tears.</p> <p>Yet such events shouldn't really shock us. The past tells us that change is inevitable. At the end of the cold war, for example, employment in military industries fell dramatically. New work had to be found elsewhere, and largely it was. Today, driven by a combination of economic, natural resource and environmental factors, rich countries inescapably face an era of industrial change and reorganisation. The worst thing we can do is go into denial about it and cling to an economic model not only whose age is passing, but which would make the necessary changes even harder when circumstances become more demanding, and which, worst of all, where the shift to green energy is concerned, denies people potential jobs, the country greater energy security and solutions to cold homes and energy poverty.</p> <p>Of course, as every good Tory knows, some things about the past were very, very good. Bring back the windmill, I say (or at least its modern equivalent).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.onehundredmonths.org\" title=\"\">Onehundredmonths.org</a></p>",

  "<p>Britain's leading employers' organisation has warned of a \"new normal\" of lacklustre growth as it predicted that the economy's long haul out of recession would last for at least a further two years.</p> <p>John Cridland, director-general of the CBI, called on George Osborne to increase spending on public infrastructure in next month's pre-budget report to help spread prosperity beyond London and its immediate hinterland.</p> <p>While ruling out a Japanese-style \"lost decade\", Cridland said: \"There is a new normal. We have to get used to steadier growth but it doesn't mean a decade of no growth at all.\"</p> <p>After previous recessions, the UK economy has bounced back and recouped output lost in the downturn through several years of growth above its long-term trend of 2.5% per annum.</p> <p>Cridland said the UK faced challenging times in which growth would be muted. He backed the growth report published by the former Conservative deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, saying it offered the prospect of growth based on key regional cities.</p> <p>He added: \"London is like an ancient Greek city state, the dynamo of the economy but different in character to the rest of the country. For the economy to be rebalanced we need to get investment across the country and export growth across the country. Not all the growth can be from London and the south-east.</p> <p>\"If rebalancing requires the private sector to take up the slack from the public sector, that is hard in those regions where so much employment and activity are delivered by the public sector.\"</p> <p>Cridland said the CBI supported the government in its aim of reducing Britain's budget deficit but said the \u00a323bn cut in capital spending had been excessive. \"That's gone too far.\" We are not spending enough on infrastructure.\"</p> <p>The employers' group said it expected the economy to gradually pick up speed over the coming two years, with zero growth in 2012 followed by a 1.4% in 2013 and 2% in 2014.</p> <p>Publishing its quarterly economic forecasts, the CBI said it was slightly more optimistic about this year and next following the unexpectedly strong official figures for the third quarter of 2012. These showed activity picking up by 1%, stronger than the 0.6% the CBI had pencilled in.</p> <p>Cridland said that there were downside risks to the forecast mostly stemming from overseas. The CBI is concerned about the uncertainty caused by the US \"fiscal cliff\", the package of tax increases and spending cuts due to be implemented in early 2013 following last year's deal between the White House and Congress.</p> <p>Although the employers' organisation said it expected a deal to prevent a 4% reduction to GDP in the US from the planned measures, it believes political brinkmanship in Washington could undermine global business confidence. Uncertainty about the future of the eurozone is also expected to damage sentiment.</p> <p>The CBI said the biggest domestic threat to its forecast came from inflation, now forecast to be higher in 2013 than previously predicted as a result of increases in utility prices.</p> <p>Despite the recent \"puzzling\" resilience of the labour market, a small rise in unemployment was possible in 2013 as a result of the lagged effects of sluggish activity in the first half of 2012. Labour market conditions are expected to improve steadily from the second half of 2013 and throughout 2014, with the jobless rate dropping to 7.7% from 7.9% now.</p> <p>Cridland said: \"Despite the better than expected third quarter performance, the UK economy has bumped along the bottom this year, with overall growth fairly flat. \"While we expect underlying momentum to pick up modestly next year and to be slightly stronger in 2014, the pace will remain relatively lacklustre. But major external risks including continuing uncertainty in the eurozone, and risks to inflation, will hit confidence and growth for some time to come.\"</p>"
