  "<p>Forcing banks to be more open and transparent about their lending, their customers and their level of risk will help transform their culture and governance and begin to tackle the sense of disconnect with the British people.</p> <p>Yet, just as George Osborne and David Cameron are watering down key parts of the <a href=\"http://bankingcommission.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Vickers commission's proposals</a>, so ministers seem determined to let the banks continue to hide important details of their local record.</p> <p>Bank lending has dropped every month since the coalition came to power and too many people either still do not having a bank account or face higher prices for loans. We need to create incentives for greater competition to provide financial services across all communities. Expanding the reach of credit unions and community 'banks' and encouraging stronger relationships with mainstream banks will be essential, but would be easier to achieve if high street banks disclosed more of their key data.</p> <p>Despite all the websites offering comparisons of banks' products, the Centre for Responsible Credit <a href=\"http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Society/documents/2012/08/08/BankingTransparencyPolicyReviewDocument6Aug12.pdf\" title=\"\">has highlighted how little data banks actually release</a> about their lending \u2013 to both businesses and personal customers.</p> <p>Information about lending to small businesses and third sector organisations at neighbourhood level or by postcode, as well as statistics about deposits, is not routinely available in the UK, even though much of this information held by banks.</p> <p>Similarly, details of where to find free-to-use cash machines, the levels of fees for unpaid direct debits, and overdraft and credit card charges are not available in a standardised format. Publishing this data would foster competition by allowing better comparisons to be made between banks' services. It would reveal the differing levels of access to financial products for businesses and individuals in particular communities and would also help to ensure policy makers can better direct support to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and tackle poverty and financial exclusion.</p> <p>Customers also need stronger information about the fees and charges they pay if they move their accounts. Hidden charges and surprise penalties create scepticism among customers, many of whom feel aggrieved at incurring more costs after years of loyalty to their bank.</p> <p>Banks should also open up to scrutiny their internal policies on managing the risks around their investment and interest rate setting decisions. After recent scandals we need to be able to see what bank staff are expected to do when they have important decisions to make on how to use the money we invest with them.</p> <p>The need for more openness has long been accepted in the United States, where the financial services community now routinely discloses what banks lend, where, and to whom \u2013 albeit in anonymised form. This has encouraged the emergence of alternative financial institutions, such as credit unions and community banks, which can provide vigorous competition in the places where traditional bank lending has been weak.</p> <p>Britain's major banks are global leaders and a vital source of domestic jobs and tax revenues. Greater openness will be part of the solution for reconnecting capital to place and for rebuilding the relationship between banks and their customers, whose savings and investments help provide the capital for lenders to do business around the world.</p> <p>The banks are not always wrong to reject applications for loans. But there are too many tales of reasonable requests being turned down, of staff in remote locations rejecting applications and of the closure of bank branches that once provided serious advice.</p> <p>We need consistent disclosure of anonymised data on what banks lend, to whom and in which parts of the country. Stronger incentives for major banks to work in all communities, including with community lenders and credit unions, will help them to be more accountable to the communities they serve. Over time it will help to plug the gaps in the market for access to financial products and improve customer services.</p> <p>Having benefitted from around \u00a31tn of capital and guarantees, greater transparency among the banks is a must-have for customers.</p> <p><em>Gareth Thomas is MP for Harrow West and shadow minister for civil society.

  "<p>David Cameron has been urged to stand up for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">renewable energy</a> against what environmental campaigners see as attacks by the Treasury.</p> <p>More than 170 green businesses signed a letter to the prime minister, drafted by the <a href=\"http://www.r-e-a.net/\" title=\"\">Renewable Energy Association</a>, calling for a public declaration of support for green energy and a resolution of the uncertainty that surrounds government plans for renewable power subsidies.</p> <p>The signatories include Frances O'Grady, deputy secretary general of the TUC, Sir Tim Smit of the Eden Project, and Penny Shepherd, chief executive of the Sustainable Investment and Finance Association of investors, as well as veteran green campaigners Jonathon Porritt and Tony Juniper, adviser to Prince Charles.</p> <p>They are worried that recent government U-turns on support for renewables are putting off much-needed investment in the sector. They point to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/25/subsidy-rates-renewable-energy\" title=\"\">recent decision on future subsidies</a>, which was long delayed and left significant issues unresolved so creating uncertainty for investors. For instance, although offshore wind subsidies are now clear until 2017, those for onshore wind face another review, and solar subsidies are likely to be reviewed again next year. This was confusing and scaring off financial backers for renewable energy projects, they said.</p> <p>The letter to Cameron invoked the Olympic spirit. It : \"We urgently need you to deliver a united 'Team GB' effort to secure the UK's place as a world leader in green skilled jobs and technology. Massive investment in renewable energy is taking place across Europe and Asia and the UK cannot afford to miss out \u2013 neither can we afford to miss our carbon targets.\"</p> <p>Martin Wright, chairman of the Renewable Energy Association, said: \"Renewables must not be treated like a political football, kicked between the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Treasury. Government shouldn't squander this once in a generation opportunity to transform our energy system into one fit for the future, with all the jobs and inward investment this will bring.\"</p> <p>The signatories also referred to recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/22/george-osborne-green-plans-tory?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">high-profile rows</a> within the cabinet over the future of renewables. Aides to chancellor George Osborne have been briefing heavily that he wants to see more investment in gas-fired power generation, even though it is a fossil fuel with a highly volatile price.</p> <p>The high cost of gas has been the biggest factor behind energy price rises in recent years, according to the government's analysis. But Osborne believes that potential investors in gas will be put off by support for renewables \u2013 even though more than 10GW of new gas-fired generation is already in the advanced stages of planning or, in some cases, construction.</p> <p><a href=\"http://rnn.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Press-Releases/High-value-opportunities-for-UK-firms-celebrated-as-government-announces-Green-Deal-as-infrastructure-guarantee-candidate-67e61.aspx\" title=\"\">In a speech to potential overseas investors in UK energy</a> on Tuesday, the chancellor failed to mention green energy at all, but praised oil and gas, pledging that gas would continue to be the UK's biggest source of energy into the 2020s and beyond. He said: \"There is no better example of the significant contribution that [the energy] sector makes to our economy than the UK oil and gas industry. This has long been one of our great industrial success stories.\"</p>",
  "<p>Banks should be forced to publish figures showing their loans to businesses and individuals in different areas of the country to reveal the \"lending deserts\" where customers are being denied access to credit, Labour has said.</p> <p>Writing on the <a href=\"https://socialenterprise.theguardian.com/en/articles/social-enterprise-network/small-business-blog/2012/aug/09/transparency-banking-credit-unions-competition\">Guardian website</a>, shadow ministers Gareth Thomas and Chris Leslie say a similar move in the US helped expose where conventional banks were routinely not lending money \u2013 usually in poorer communities \u2013 and helped bring in competition from alternative lenders such as credit unions and community banks. They cite the example of Thamesmead, an area of London which has a population of 55,000 and not a single bank branch.</p> <p>\"The banks are not always wrong to reject applications for loans,\" they said. \"But there are too many tales of reasonable requests being turned down, of staff in remote locations rejecting applications and of the closure of bank branches that once provided serious advice.\"</p> <p>The move, one of several initiatives to emerge from the party's policy review on banking, comes as the British Bankers' Association published details of lending by Britain's major banks to businesses in England, Wales and Scotland in the first three months of this year.</p> <p>The quarterly figures show lending to small- and medium-sized businesses between the last quarter of 2011 and January-March 2012 fell in all regions except north-east England and Wales. Banks blamed \"reduced demand\". Lending by the major banks in London, the highest regional total, was about four times the total in the north-east, which had the lowest aggregate figure.</p> <p>\"The reason behind [compiling the figures] was to see if there were lending deserts and to find out, if there were, how we could best help people in those areas,\" said a BBA spokesman.</p> <p>The BBA said it hoped in future to publish even more detailed data by postcode. Under the Labour proposals, all banks would be asked to publish this data individually, broken down by postcode, said Thomas.</p> <p>Labour's review also suggested banks should be made to release standardised details of their fees and penalty charges for bank accounts, loans and credit cards so they can be easily compared.</p> <p>They should also have to \"open up to scrutiny\" internal policies on managing risks of investment and interest rate setting decisions, said Thomas, the shadow civil society minister, and Leslie, shadow financial secretary to the Treasury.</p> <p>\"Britain's major banks are global leaders and a vital source of domestic jobs and tax revenues,\" they said. \"Greater openness will be part of the solution for reconnecting capital to place and rebuilding the relationship between banks and their customers.\"</p>",
  "<p>Sporting a gentleman's wristwatch on his left arm, Charles Somerset Lawrence Clarke stormed his way to fourth place in a world-class 110m hurdles final, the first global final of his career. The 22-year-old attended Eton school, is related to the Roosevelt family and is heir to a baronetcy, and he dipped perfectly on the line to clinch a place just outside the medals in a time of 13.39sec.</p> <p>The Commonwealth bronze medallist, coached by Malcolm Arnold alongside the world 400m hurdles champion Dai Greene, came into these Games ranked 20th in the world: to finish fourth exceeded all expectations. \"I can't believe it,\" he said. \"If you'd have said you were going to make the semi-final I would have taken that. To come fourth in the Olympic Games, it's hard to put it into words. I'm on such a high, but I'm just so knackered. I feel like I'm about to pass out. It's the most surreal feeling. When I crossed the line the crowd went nuts.\"</p> <p>Clarke set a personal best of 13.31 in the semi-final, keeping his cool as hurdles clattered to the left and right of him, to nail the last of eight qualifying places for the final. But against a world-class field that included both current and former world champions, the world record holder and this season's world No1 ranked athlete, Aries Merritt, he had not been expected to make any impression on the top placings.</p> <p>\"It hasn't sunk in, I don't think it ever will,\" said Clarke, who started hurdling seriously only as a 19-year-old, a fact that he blames on Eton's emphasis on academic achievement.</p> <p>\"The last four years have been remarkable, I can't thank my coach enough \u2013 he took me from a 15.3 to 13.3, so that's just fantastic \u2026 I haven't had that strength base that these guys have had and I need to be able to pick it up in the middle of the race and hopefully over the next four years I'll be able to do that. Hopefully I'll go to the world championships in Beijing in 2015 and see what that Olympic track was like and hopefully that will set me up for 2016 in Rio.</p> <p>\"My dream is to win an Olympic gold and the peak age is 26 to 30, so I'm four years off that in the next Olympics. This stadium in 2017 will hopefully be the place I'm targeting the gold medal in the world championships.\"</p> <p>Merritt, who has been in sensational form all season, set a personal best to take Olympic gold in 12.92 into a headwind. His USA team-mate, the world champion Jason Richardson, took silver in 13.04, while Hansle Parchment of Jamaica claimed bronze in a national record of 13.12. The world record holder, Dayron Robles of Cuba, pulled up short with a hamstring injury, leaving Clarke to battle it out with the 2009 world champion, Ryan Brathwaite, who finished fifth just 0.01 behind the Briton.</p> <p>Elsewhere there was disappointment for the British long jumper Shara Proctor. Despite qualifying in pole position for the final \u2013 nailing 6.83m with her first and only effort \u2013 and being billed as a good chance to sneak a medal, the 23-year-old who hails from the tiny island of Anguilla struggled to fulfil her promise on an evening when it really mattered. Under pressure from the first round after recording a distance of just 6.55m \u2013 well below the British record she set in July of 6.95m \u2013 Proctor never seemed able to recover as the rest of the field grew in strength. The two-times world champion Brittney Reese of the USA set the standard with a gold medal-winning jump of 7.12 in only the second round.</p> <p>In contrast, Proctor's confidence took a battering \u2013 she fouled her second attempt and landed just 6.37 with her third. Kneeling in the sand, the expression on her face told of her disappointment. Ahead of these Games Proctor had been full of confidence after a sensational season in which she broke the British indoor record three times, won bronze at the world indoors, and then bettered Bev Kinch's 1983 outdoor British record with a standout performance at the Olympic trials. Sadly, though, it was not to be. Proctor finished ninth overall.</p> <p>Mo Farah says his new status as 10,000m Olympic champion has made him a marked man after he was subjected to some serious jostling in his 5,000m heat. \"I am definitely a target,\" said the 29-year-old. \"I am the Olympic champion over 10,000 metres. You just have to accept it. Hopefully the final won't be as rough because we won't have so many guys. It was really rough. It was like being in the ring with [the British boxer] Anthony Ogogo. As soon as they saw me, there was a lot of barging and pushing.\"</p> <p>Farah finished third in his heat, in 13min 26sec \u2013 one of the slower times of the round \u2013 and admitted he was weary following his 10,000m win.</p> <p>\"By the time I got back it was a late night and there was a lot of emotion. It is something I had never done before and now I know how much it takes out of you. I am definitely tired and I think it showed out there. The legs didn't feel great but that is what happens. Hopefully I will recover well and look forward to the final, forget about what I have done and rest up.\"</p> <p>In the hammer the 21-year-old Sophie Hitchon, who took up the event only five years ago after spending her teenage years as a ballet dancer, qualified for Friday's final with a British record of 71.98m on her third and final attempt.</p> <p>Britain will have two competitors in the 1500m final after the world silver medallist Lisa Dobriskey and the 21-year-old Laura Weightman, the latter coached by Steve Cram, both qualified for Friday's final. Weightman took over a second off her personal best \u2013 dipping on the line to clinch a time of 4:02.99. Dobriskey, the world silver medallist of 2007 who crashed out of last year's world championships in the first round with a hip injury that required surgery, announced herself to be back in contention on the global stage with a confident performance in her semi-final, finishing fourth in a time of 4:05.35.</p> <p>In the pole vault Steve Lewis sailed through to the final with just one jump, at 5.50m.</p>",

But it is slowly healing. Many of the conditions necessary for a recovery are in place, and the monetary policy committee [MPC] will continue to do all it can to bring about that recovery.</p> <p>\"As I have said many times, the recovery and rebalancing of our economy will be a long, slow process. It is to our Olympic team that we should look for inspiration. They have shown us the importance of total commitment when trying to achieve a goal that may lie some years ahead.\"</p> <p>King said it would take a \"bit of time\" to assess the impact of the Bank's new <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/13/george-osborne-funding-for-lending-scheme?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">funding for lending scheme</a> (FLS), which came into force last week and is designed to encourage banks to lend more at lower interest rates. Last month, Threadneedle Street announced a \u00a350bn increase in its QE programme to \u00a3375bn by November, and the governor said further purchases of government gilts to create money were an option.</p> <p>Chancellor George Osborne said the government had an opportunity to give \"110% attention and effort and energy to getting the economy moving.\"</p> <p>He said: \"I think the governor is right on the big picture, which is the economy is healing, but it is a slow and difficult process and we're dealing with some very deep-rooted problems at home and some storms from abroad.\"</p> <p>On the foreign exchanges, the pound rose slightly after King expressed strong reservations about cutting the bank rate from its historic low of 0.5%. The governor said there was a risk that such a move could prove counterproductive by making life more difficult for some banks and building societies.</p> <p>Vicky Redwood, UK analyst at Capital Economics, said it would not take much to tip the nine-strong MPC towards further action. \"We expect another \u00a350bn [of QE] to be announced in November when the current purchases are completed.\"</p> <p>King strongly defended the Bank's forecasting record against accusations that it had persistently been over-optimistic about growth, pointing to a euro crisis that \"goes on and on and on\" as the reason for the latest downgrade.</p> <p>He said tumbling inflation would eventually boost consumer spending by raising real incomes, while the FLS was \"bigger and bolder than any initiative so far tried to get the banks lending again\".</p> <p>Labour seized on the admission in the inflation report that banks might use the FLS to inflate their profits rather than lowering interest rates, and said it was time for a Plan B on the economy.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves MP, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"With growth forecasts slashed yet again, not just this year but in future years too, it is clear that we cannot go on with the same failing plan from this government. The chancellor's policies aren't only causing short-term pain, but long-term damage to our economy too. And despite the crisis in the eurozone, Britain is just one of two G20 countries in a double-dip recession.\"</p> <p>King said the Bank found it difficult to explain why the jobs market had been so resilient at a time when official figures have shown the economy deep in a double-dip recession. Threadneedle Street has lowered its longer-term growth projections for the economy in the belief that there has been permanent damage caused by the deepest and longest downturn since the second world war.</p> <p>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: \"It seems likely that we have entered a 'new normal' period where growth will be relatively subdued by historic standards for some years to come as the banking system remains impaired and global commodity prices remain relatively high and volatile.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"While we do our good works let us not forget that the real solution lies in a world in which charity will have become unnecessary.\" So wrote the great African man of letters <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe\" title=\"\">Chinua Achebe</a> in his 1987 novel Anthills of the Savannah. His words should ring loud in the ears of those attending the global hunger event (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/27/david-cameron-hunger-summit-olympics\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 27 July) in London this Sunday. At the summit \"good works\" will no doubt be done which we will applaud but for too long the dominant if well-meaning approach has been the short-term fix. We need to lift our ideas and open our eyes towards the new and changing Africa: a future where African children's experience of famine is only from history books.</p> <p>Let's be clear. Parts of Africa are blighted by poverty, hunger, war, corruption and the vagaries of a harsh and changing climate. Today severe hunger is stalking a huge swath of Africa from Senegal in the west to Chad, on through Sudan and all the way to Somalia in the east. More than 20 million people are affected. These parts of this vast continent need our collective support. Immediate aid is needed.</p> <p>But Africa also needs sustained long-term investment which helps people provide enough food for their families, build their own future, withstand the next challenge and lift their horizons beyond the latest crisis.</p> <p>Let's also be clear that the solution lies in Africa \u2013 a continent of vibrant, talented, creative and hard-working people. Africans need a relationship with the rest of the world that treats them as who they are \u2013 equals with something to offer. Every one of us on this planet is descended from shared but distant ancestors. Whether from those who stayed or from those who made those tentative steps out of the continent millennia ago, we are all African. Together we can make an African future where \"charity will have become unnecessary\".<br><strong>Baaba Maal </strong><em>musician, Senegal</em><br><strong>Angelique Kidjo </strong><em>musician, Benin</em><br><strong>Femi Kuti </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Hugh Masekela, </strong><em>musician, South Africa</em><br><strong>Oumou Sangare </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Amadou and Mariam </strong><em>musicians, Mali</em><br><strong>Sidi Tour\u00e9 </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Djimon Hounsou </strong><em>actor, US/Benin</em><br><strong>Chiwetel Ejiofor </strong><em>actor, UK/Nigeria</em><br><strong>Mulatu Astatke </strong><em>musician, Ethiopia</em><br><strong>Jupiter </strong><em>musician, Democratic Republic of Congo</em><br><strong>Muntu Valdo </strong><em>musician, Cameroon</em><br><strong>Fatoumata Diawara </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Ismael Lo </strong><em>musician, Senegal</em><br><strong>2Face </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Lami Philips</strong> <em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Soundsultan </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Y'en A Marre </strong><em>activist movement, Senegal</em><br><strong>Cheikh Lo </strong><em>Senegal</em><br><strong>Kwame Anthony Appiah </strong><em>writer, UK/Ghana</em><br><strong>Croque Mort </strong><em>musician, Chad</em><br><strong>Didier Awadi </strong><em>musician, Senegal</em><br><strong>Sara Mitaru </strong><em>musician, Kenya</em><br><strong>Nanjira </strong><em>musician, Kenya</em><br><strong>Octopizzo </strong><em>musician, Kenya</em><br><strong>Camp Mulla </strong><em>musicians, Kenya</em><br><strong>Ice Prince Zamani </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Jesse Jagz Abaga </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Jude MI Abaga </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Brymo Ashimi </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>David \"Blackman\" Muthami </strong><em>producer, Kenya</em></p> <p>\u2022 You have recently reported on UN and Zimbabwean government predictions suggesting that up to 1.6 million people in the country will require food aid next year (Report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/zimbabwe-food-shortages-aid\" title=\"\">1 August</a>).

  "<p>Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC, which briefly outsold Apple in the US only a year ago, has joined Nokia and BlackBerry on the mobile industry casualty list after a \u00a3750m crash in its stock market value.</p> <p>Last Friday evening, when HTC warned that its third-quarter revenues could be 45% lower than a year earlier, the company was worth 236bn New Taiwan Dollars (\u00a35bn). In just three days' trading on the Taiwanese exchange it is worth \u00a34.3bn.</p> <p>The first company to use Google's Android software, HTC was once seen as leading the smartphone revolution. Last autumn, while consumers waited for the new iPhone, HTC briefly sold more smartphones than any other brand in the US.</p> <p>Its subsequent decline, with shares more than halving so far this year, is a measure of how rapidly fortunes change in this fiercely competitive market.</p> <p>Since February, 47 foreign institutional investors, including funds managed by UBS and Invesco, have completely sold down their holdings in HTC, according to data firm FactSet. A further 88 funds have sold down their holdings in the company.</p> <p>The problem stems from the US, where the largest mobile networks have withdrawn subsidies from HTC in order to pump them into the two most popular brands, Apple and Samsung.</p> <p>According to Graeme Oxby, head of mobile at Virgin Media, HTC's slide in popularity may be \"difficult to come back from\". Its attempt at a comeback this spring with one of the world's most powerful phones in terms of computing speed, the HTC One X, was drowned out by the buzz around Samsung's latest Galaxy model, the SIII.</p> <p>\"The HTC One is a really good phone, but it's just lost its cachet,\" said Oxby. \"You have seen a real polarisation towards the top end in smartphones, led by Apple. HTC are firmly in the middle, but the market has moved up. It's often difficult to comeback from that.\"</p> <p>The move towards phones that are increasingly able to do as much as a basic desktop computer has also hammered Nokia and BlackBerry maker Research In Motion, which have both issued profit warnings amid plummeting revenues.</p> <p>Founded in 1997, HTC is one of the newest companies in the handset business and among the most specialised. While Samsung has a history of making TVs and white goods, and Apple's heritage is in computers, HTC has concentrated on phones and pocket computers. It rose to prominence making phones to be sold as own-label by mobile networks \u2013 so-called white label products \u2013 before successfully marketing handsets under its own brand.</p> <p>The growth of Android helped propel it to a peak global market share of 10.7% in the second quarter of 2011, putting it in fourth position among the smartphone makers according to research firm Strategy Analytics. That share has now slipped back to 6.1%.</p> <p>\"If you've got the wrong product you can decline very fast, it is quite a frightening market to be in,\" said Neil Mawston, who researches handsets for Strategy Analytics. \"History shows that when you decline so fast, the recovery tends to come slowly. We are looking at a two or three year time span for HTC to get anywhere near where it was before.\"</p> <p>He put Samsung's success down to greater marketing muscle and a bigger global sales force.

The rate was unprecedented, with the thaw more widespread than ever as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/arctic-climate-change\" title=\"\">unseasonally warm weather across the Arctic</a> took effect.</p> <p>\"It was so extraordinary that at first I questioned the result: was this real or was it due to a data error?\" wondered Son Nghiem, one of the scientists responsible for the research at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. In a normal summer, some melting is observed over about half the island's surface area. This new data \u2013 from three satellites \u2013 raised serious concerns over the progress of global warming and the likely consequences.</p> <p>For scientists at the Met Office's world-renowned <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-change/resources/hadley\" title=\"\">Hadley research centre</a> in Exeter, the question was not just how fast Greenland was melting, but something much trickier. They have been crunching through years of data from dozens of satellites, trying to establish whether the conditions in the Arctic circle are related to the record-breaking washout of a summer in the UK. </p> <p>The news could be disconcerting for fans of the British summer. Because when it comes to global warming, we can forget the jolly predictions of Jeremy Clarkson and his ilk of a Mediterranean climate in which we lounge among the olive groves of Yorkshire sipping a fine Scottish champagne. The truth is likely to be much duller, and much nastier \u2013 and we have already had a taste of it. \"We will see lots more floods, droughts, such as we've had this year in the UK,\" says <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/peter-stott\" title=\"\">Peter Stott</a>, leader of the climate change monitoring and attribution team at the Met Office. \"Climate change is not a nice slow progression where the global climate warms by a few degrees. It means a much greater variability, far more extremes of weather.\"</p> <p>A series of unusually wet and cold summers has afflicted the UK for several years. Remember the devastating floods of 2007, when some areas received double their normal rainfall for June? Or the predictions of a \"barbecue summer\" in 2009 that backfired badly on the Met Office as the (correctly anticipated) high temperatures were accompanied by heavy clouds and rainstorms? The impression that many Britons have had that summer weather has been getting worse in recent years is borne out by the data \u2013 five out of the last six years (2007-2012), have shown below-average sunshine from June to August, and in some cases well below average. All have had above-average rainfall \u2013 in some cases more than 50% above the long-term average. \"It is not just a perception \u2013 we have had a run of relatively poor summers,\" says Stott.</p> <p>This year has been the worst so far. April was the wettest on record, and so was the period from April to June. The sun was missing too \u2013 June was the second dullest recorded. Hopes that August might bring more settled weather were dashed when the first few days brought floods as far apart as Scotland and Somerset, forcing scores of people from their homes. The unseasonally wet and miserable summer may have failed to dampen the Olympic spirit but it has brought misery to thousands.</p> <p>Nor has the UK been alone in suffering extreme weather. In the US, the eastern seaboard has been hit by heatwaves and storms but even worse has been the \"dustbowl effect\" in Texas and across much of the nation's agricultural heartland. India's monsoon failed to appear on schedule, leaving millions of farmers in the subcontinent facing destitution. Floods in Beijing, after the heaviest rainfall in 60 years, caused devastation to millions.</p> <p>The consequences across the world have been and will be dire. A food crisis is now all but inevitable, according to the US agriculture secretary. Emergency plans are being discussed in India, while in China the clear-up is accompanied by concerns that environmental degradation may be making the country's problems worse.</p> <p>Attributing any single weather event, or short pattern of events, however extreme, to climate change is always tricky. Extreme weather events occur, in the scientists' term, stochastically \u2013 they happen by themselves, unpredictably, owing to the natural variations of the weather.</p> <p>But the science of climate change has progressed rapidly in recent years. Last month, the Met Office and NOAA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, <a href=\"http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/advisories/20120710-advisory-climatewebinar.html\" title=\"\">published a groundbreaking report</a> that showed recent events could be attributed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/10/extreme-weather-manmade-climate-change?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">human causes</a>. Last year's unseasonally warm November in the UK \u2013 the second hottest since records began in 1659 \u2013 was shown to be at least 60 times more likely to have happened because of climate change than because of natural variations in the earth's weather systems.</p> <p>Stott says: \"We are much more confident about attributing [weather effects] to climate change. This is all adding up to a stronger picture of human influence on the climate.\"</p> <p>For the British Isles, the melting Arctic could hold the key to whether the weather is changing under human impacts. Recent poor summers have been strongly linked by scientists to a change in the usual position of the <a href=\"http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/tag/jet-stream/\" title=\"\">jet stream</a>, a weather system that normally lies in high latitudes during the northern hemisphere summer.</p> <p>Earlier this year, two US scientists published a paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggesting that the meandering of the jet stream could be linked to the reduction in sea ice. <a href=\"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/geography/staff/hanna_edward/icesheet\" title=\"\">Edward Hanna</a>, reader in climate science at the University of Sheffield, who is taking part in <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL051000.shtml\" title=\"\">similar research</a>, explains: \"The last six summers since 2007, while often rather cool and wet over the UK, have brought Greenland unusually high air pressure, mild southerly winds, record-breaking temperatures and melting of the land ice.\" The link, he believes, is that Arctic sea-ice losses and the <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL051000.shtml\" title=\"\">release of heat over the Arctic Ocean</a> have tended to weaken the jet stream and make it more meandering. This has brought more low pressures over Britain, less stable conditions, more cloud cover and rain-bearing weather systems from the Atlantic.</p> <p>This year, the jet stream moved much more than usual, passing south of the UK. It also persisted in this position for an unusually long time. If this pushing of the jet stream southward is indeed linked to less sea ice over the Arctic circle, as Hanna suspects, then the signs are that we will see many more of these wet summers in future.</p> <p>Despite the recent advances in climate-change science, it is too early to say whether this is certain. Hanna warns: \"Six years is a relatively short time, and there are quite a number of other factors \u2013 sea-surface temperatures, variations in the sun's power and the partly random and chaotic nature of atmospheric circulation \u2013 that can affect jet stream patterns, so further research is needed to make us more confident about the nature of these changes.\"</p> <p>That means it could take several years \u2013 aided by the roomfuls of supercomputers at the Met Office \u2013 to come up with more sturdy evidence linking our poor summers with climate change. If the link is established, it could signal similarly dull and disappointing British summers for many years to come.</p> <p>But one piece of the picture may be about to fade. The majority of the most valuable data we have amassed \u2013 including the images of Greenland's surface melting \u2013 comes from between 20 and 30 satellites that are now under threat. Ageing <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41895904/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/lost-satellite-deals-heavy-blow-climate-research/\" title=\"\">satellites</a> are being removed from orbit and not replaced, while those that remain are at ever greater risk of buffeting from the debris that now litters space. \"There is a severe danger of not being able to see so clearly [from space] in future with the fall-out of satellites, uncertain government funding and so on,\" says Kate Willett of the Hadley Centre.</p> <p>Unless the satellite data continues to stream down, we will never know whether the UK is at risk of a new age of drizzly summers and dry winters, and drought alternating with flooding.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Greenland, inhabitants have been basking in an almost unheard-of heat, regularly topping 20C, with a succession of dry sunny days dominating the weather over the past two months. \"It's been lovely here, much warmer than usual \u2013 we've really been enjoying a nice summer,\" says Henrik Stendal from his offices in Nuuk, the capital. British staycationers can only shiver in envy.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2012. The original stated that NOAA stood for the US National Oceans and Atmospheric Administration.

  "<p>As the US faces record drought and an Old Testament-level pestilential heatwave in the midwest, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/science/earth/americans-link-global-warming-to-extreme-weather-poll-says.html\">American environmental denialism may be starting to change</a>. The question is: is it too late?</p> <p>America has led the world in climate change denial, a phenomenon noted with amazement by Europeans, not to mention thinking people around the world. Year after year, the US has failed to sign global treaties or curb emissions, even as our status as a source of a third of the world's carbon emissions goes unchanged.</p> <p>It is fairly well-known what has been behind that climate change denial in America: vast sums pumped into an ignorance industry by the oil and gas lobbies. Entire thinktanks to obfuscate manmade climate change have been funded by these interests, as have individual congressmen and women. Entirely typical, for instance, is Louisiana Representative John Fleming, whose campaigns, <a href=\"Indeed, this sadly hilarious blogpost by a constituent who actually tried to educate \">according to blogger John Henry</a>, accept about $200,000 a year from oil and gas lobbyists, and who uses his social media pages to deny global warming.</p> <p>It is weird to live inside that US denial about climate change. Last year, for example, as tropical storm Irene approached New York, we duly boarded up windows, put in emergency supplies, and heard endless alarming bulletins from the mayor's office about which neighborhoods were likely to be submerged if the tides surged \u2013 without ever hearing from local officials or the media a word connecting rising sea levels with manmade global warming. All the more weird because New Yorkers weren't writing off portions of their downtown neighborhoods to overflowing seawater a century ago.</p> <p>It is weird, too, to watch the leaves turn red earlier and earlier in the fall in the American northeast and have absolutely everyone say, \"the weather is strange\" \u2013 yet never see mainstream media reflect any interest in the connection between human industrial activity and that strangeness. And <a href=\"http://www.wunderground.com/severe.asp\">this weather map shows</a> how widespread and extensive that extreme weather is in the US. </p> <p>But could our denial be cracking, this summer, as, in the heartland \u2013 that most iconic of American landscapes \u2013 broiling temperatures injure humans and cook fish in the water? This summer a crisis has occurred (though one that, again, is seldom reported on in terms of our outsize contribution to the disaster), as midwestern farmers lost vast swaths of their corn crop to scalding heat and drought. In the American unconscious of wishful ignorance, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/05/midwest-heat-wave-2012_n_1744504.html?utm_hp_ref=green\">this disaster and loss was to be borne, as usual, by other people far away</a>.</p> <p>But we face some serious problems in rising out of our torpor. In <a href=\"http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/climate-change/shifting-public-opinion-empirical-assessment-influencing-concern-u-s/\">\"Shifting Public Opinion on Climate Change: An Empirical Assessment of Factors Influencing Concern over Climate Change in the US, 2002\u20132010\"</a>, John Wihbey shows that Gallup surveys reveal Americans' level of concern varying widely:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In 2004, 26% of respondents said they worried \"a great deal\" about the issue; in 2007 that number rose to 41%; by 2010, it had fallen to 28%. This variation comes despite consensus among scientists about <a href=\"http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/climate-change/studies/environment/climate-change/un-report-managing-climate-change/\">the underlying data patterns</a> and virtual <a href=\"http://journalistsresource.org/studies/environment/climate-change/studies/environment/climate-change/structure-scientific-opinion-climate-change/\">unanimity of scientific opinion</a>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Wihbey and colleagues' study found that this fluctuation was caused by, among other factors, political polarization. In other words, when one party says global warming is a crisis and the other says all that is nonsense, and there is no cooperation between political elites at both ends of the spectrum, the net result is apathy.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The two strongest effects on public concern are Democratic congressional action statements and Republican roll-call votes, which increase and diminish public concern, respectively. This finding points to the effect of [a] polarized political elite that is emitting contrary cues, with resulting (seemingly) contrary levels of public concern.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>They found, ominously, that the level and quality of good information in the general media at large had little effect on people's levels of concern \u2013 indeed, weather events themselves had little bearing on people's levels of climate-related anxiety or interest. Only the combination of media coverage and expressed alarm from political leaders bumped up public concern.</p> <p>With the oil and gas lobbies pumping money into Congress to blunt any professed concern among the political class, that motivating union of genuine concern and honest messaging can scarcely be relied on. The authors conclude, dispiritedly:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Given the vested economic interests reflected in this polarization, it seems doubtful that any communication process focused on persuading individuals will have much impact.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I spent part of this summer looking at glaciers in Alaska; in Juneau, in <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r10/tongass/\">Tongass National Forest</a>, park rangers expect that a glacier there will withdraw, from effects of anticipated climate change, in 50 years. So, the federal government is planning for the effects of manmade climate change, even as the White House and US Congress remain paralysed from doing anything to arrest the warming: the very definition of denial. If we don't snap out of this stasis of stupidity, nothing can change for good.</p>",
  "<p>At 8pm on Thursday , the world's attention will turn towards a tall Kenyan runner called David Rudisha. The 23-year-old Maasai is the 800m world champion and world record holder, and the closest thing there is to a shoo-in for a gold medal on the track at the 2012 Games.</p> <p>The question on the lips of commentators at the start of the 800m final will almost certainly not be whether he will win, but by how much.</p> <p>Sitting watching on a small, flickering television in his house in the town of Iten, high in Kenya's Rift valley, will be a 63-year-old Irish Brother.</p> <p>\"A few of the other athletes might come and watch it with me, or I might watch it alone,\" he says.</p> <p>Brother Colm O'Connell first arrived in the Rift valley from Cork in 1976 on a two-year placement to teach at Iten's Catholic boarding school, St Patrick's. When the school's athletics coach returned to the UK a few months later O'Connell stepped into the vacant role.</p> <p>\"I had no formal coaching experience,\" he says. \"So I just learned from the athletes.\"</p> <p>He was a good student. Within a few years his school teams started doing well in national competitions, and in 1986 he was asked to select the Kenyan team for the first-ever World Junior Championships in Athens.</p> <p>He picked nine runners, seven from his own St Patrick's school, and to his surprise they came home with nine medals, including four golds.</p> <p>\"It was then that I realised we had something special going on here,\" he says.</p> <p>Three years later, in 1989, he started the first running camp in Kenya. It was in the school holidays and initially it was just for girls. \"I just wanted to give athletics a bit more focus,\" he says.</p> <p>The idea caught on, and today there are over 120 running camps in the region, housing many of the greatest distance runners on the planet.</p> <p>O'Connell's camps are still going too, and it is a considered a great honour to be invited to attend one. The coach has had an incredible success rate, with about 60% of those attending his camps going on to become international athletes \u2013 among them numerous world and Olympic champions. Wherever he goes, athletes stop to talk to him and shake his hand. \"He is the godfather of Kenyan running,\" they say.</p> <p>O'Connell first spotted 14-year-old David Rudisha in 2004, running the 200m sprint at a provincial schools race. \"He only came fifth,\" says O'Connell. \"But I noticed he was a tall, elegant runner, and that he was focused, so I made a mental note to watch out for his progress.\"</p> <p>The next year he found Rudisha doing the decathlon in another schools competition. He also found out that the schoolboy's father was Daniel Rudisha, a former 400m runner who had won a silver medal in the relay at the 1968 Olympics. O'Connell invited the young Rudisha to attend one of his training camps.</p> <p>\"I wasn't thinking, 'great 800m runner'. But he was a good all-round athlete, so I thought I'd give him a try.\"</p> <p>At the end of the two-week camp O'Connell told Rudisha, who was now 15, that he'd like to see him run 800m.</p> <p>\"He had never run an 800m before,\" says O'Connell. \"So I wasn't expecting anything. Then the surprise came.\"</p> <p>As the runners set off around the track, with sheep grazing on the infield, O'Connell watched from the side. Running alongside Rudisha that day was the recently crowned Kenyan national schools 800m champion.</p> <p>The track in Iten is made of dirt and the inside lane is worn down to a rutted channel that makes it hard to keep your footing. The track is also a few metres too long. And it sits on the edge of the Kerio escarpment, jutting out into the vast sky, at a lung-sapping altitude of about 2440 metres (8,000ft).</p> <p>Rudisha crossed the line first. \"He won,\" says O'Connell. \"He beat the national champion. And he ran 1 minute 49.6 seconds.\" For those not versed in 800m times, that's remarkably quick considering his age and the conditions. And it was his first 800m race ever.</p> <p>\"I didn't make a big issue of it,\" O'Connell says. \"I didn't even tell him the time.\" Instead, gradually, without fuss, he shifted Rudisha over to the 800m. \"The rest,\" he says, \"is history.\"</p> <p>The two men have since formed a strong bond, and the 800m runner is one of the few athletes O'Connell has continued to coach into the senior ranks.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you find you just gel with someone,\" O'Connell tells me. \"As a teenager, Rudisha made a big sacrifice to move across the country to attend a school near Iten so he could be part of our group.</p> <p>\"He used to come at the weekends to stay and train, and sometimes in the evenings after school. The senior athletes, Isaac Songok and Augustine Choge, used to take him off for runs into the forest. He used to love that.\"</p> <p>In 2010 Rudisha broke the 13-year-old world 800m record twice in one week. Then, in 2011, he won his first global title at the World Athletics Championships in Daegu.</p> <p>\"There are three things on a global level that you can achieve in athletics,\" says O'Connell. \"He has two of them. There is one missing. Winning the Olympics, he knows, will give him immortality.\"</p> <p>As for O'Connell, after the race he will take his usual evening stroll to the Kerio View hotel for a drink overlooking the valley in Iten. Or, as it is now more commonly known in Kenya, the Home of Champions.</p> <p><em>Adharanand Finn is author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571274055\" title=\"\"><em>Running with the Kenyans, by Faber &amp; Faber</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2012.

Having spoken everywhere from Lincoln and Liverpool to Essex to Edinburgh, and most places in between, he speaks about his experiences with Aspergers Syndrome; discussing how he developed from a child considered a \"monster\" to an A- Grade student. Dean encourages his audiences to see the condition in a much more positive light, through his humorous and poignant anecdotes.

A decade earlier, Trevor quickly progressed to become the head of the School's Sixth form College in 1988. He moved to Islington Green School in 2002, the school Tony Blair refused to send his children to despite his public commitment to comprehensive education. It controversially failed its Ofsted inspection in 1997. Nine months after Trevor joined the school it passed its inspection and the registered inspector described him as \"visionary and transformational\". In 2004 Tony Blair's former speech writer Peter Hyman joined the school and wrote his book <em>One out of ten</em>, comparing Trevor's leadership style favourably with Blair. Peter and Trevor worked together to start the process of Islington Green becoming an Academy in 2008. In 2007 Trevor was appointed executive head of Salisbury School in North London, to effect his brand of transformation on the second poorest school in London. Five terms after joining the school, he and his team had reduced 200 exclusions to zero, doubled the key exam indicator and set the groundwork to successfully pass its OFSTED inspection. That year Trevor was named as one of the top 100 up and coming most influential people in London in the Evening Standard's Poll and became a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. In January 2009 he founded Lilac Sky Schools with his educational partner and became its director of education \u2013 broadening his chance to influence schools throughout the UK. Lilac Sky Schools has worked with over 40 schools since its inception. The company runs 4 schools \u2013 a secondary, primary and special school included. One of the schools - Sky College in Somerset was taken out of special measures within 12 months of being taken over. The HMI noted the influence of the Lilac Sky Team led by Trevor in its energy &amp; enthusiasm supporting the school transforming from failure to success. </p> <h2>Barbara Bergstr\u00f6m</h2> <p>Founder and chairman of the board of directors, <strong>Internationella Engelska Skolan (IES)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-400478276\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347460178878/Barbara-Bergstrom-002.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Bergstrom\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em></em> Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Barbara Bergstr\u00f6m, an American by origin and a science teacher by profession, started her first free school in Sweden in 1993, when a national voucher system was introduced. She presented parents an alternative to the dominant \"feel good\" curriculum and \"anything goes\". With up to half of the teaching in English, performed by native English speakers, and a structured environment in which teachers can teach and students learn, \"tough love\", the school was an immediate success among parents. It has become the leading free school in the compulsory school system in Sweden, with 19 schools and over 13000 students. Ms. Bergstrom was awarded \"Entrepreneur of the year\" in Sweden in 2009. She remains as chairman of the board of Internationella Engelska Skolan. In 2012, IES is starting its first free school in the UK in Brandon, Suffolk. If Britain wishes to see a major sector of free schools, and a real choice for parents of all backgrounds, then allowing school companies and free individual choice of school is the only way forward. Naturally, it has to be combined with the right public institutions for accreditation and inspection. </p> <h2>Wendy Berliner</h2> <p>Head of education, professional networks, <strong>Guardian News and Media</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-400478275\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2011/10/13/Wendy-Berliner140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Innovation in Education 2011: Wendy Berliner\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wendy Berliner is an award winning education journalist who has spent half her career at The Guardian, first as education correspondent, then as a news editor and later as an education feature writer.

The programme works with educators from all phases, and aims to develop a comprehensive enterprise learning entitlement that reaches all young people, from as soon as they start school, aged four. Catherine inspires teachers and headteachers to harness 'enterprise' as a vehicle for transformation, re-energising teaching and learning and motivating students and staff alike. The impact of this work was recognised nationally, with Rotherham being crowned 'The Most Enterprising Place in Britain' in 2010 for the enterprise culture developed through Rotherham Ready.

In turn, the team have all experienced subject specific CPD in their own right, giving them the confidence to take on new leadership roles. The focus on CPD within the team led to individuals leading their own sessions such as workshops for parents and training for primary colleagues, who subsequently went on to lead training at their own primary schools.

She began by working with children with SEN/statements in primary and secondary schools in Sheffield. This was followed by mentoring and senior mentoring with a cluster of 20 schools across the city. Lynn achieved a senior leadership role as an inclusion manager, followed by deputy head whilst working in a school with disadvantaged, disengaged and socially excluded pupils and then became the deputy head of the school where over 50% of the pupils were SEN. Therefore her knowledge and experience of inclusion, EBD, ASD and the ECM agenda really came to the forefront. During her time as deputy she achieved the national professional qualification for headship and was the first person to achieve a headship without QTS.</p> <p>Lynn's new role at Axcis Education as an executive manager is an exciting development in her career, working nationally alongside principals and headteachers, addressing their senior leadership recruitment needs, whilst taking into account the skills and experience required to drive forward school improvement.</p> <h2>Christine Gilbert</h2> <p>Visiting professor, <strong>Institute of Education</strong> and managing director, <strong>CGA</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-400478277\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346943612143/Christine-Gilbert-003.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Gilbert\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em></em> Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Christine Gilbert was formerly chief inspector of Ofsted.

  "<p>Meles Zenawi, the cerebral ruler of Ethiopia for the last 21 years, is a man with many reputations. Celebrated by donors as a visionary philosopher-king who has brought development to his impoverished country of 75 million people, his domestic critics have condemned him as an iron-fisted dictator.</p> <p>Meles, now 57, came to power in 1991 after his Tigray People's Liberation Front waged a successful war, alongside the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, that toppled the dictatorship of the Soviet-backed Mengistu Haile Mariam.</p> <p>The new leader strongly supported Eritrea's independence in 1993, but within five years the former allies were fighting a bloody conflict that lasted between 1998 and 2000 and resulted in nearly 100,000 deaths.</p> <p>Matters were not all peaceful at home either. In 2005, when the opposition won all 23 seats in Addis Ababa in parliamentary elections, the regime reacted harshly, killing 200 protesters and locking up 30,000 opponents. Some were later tried for treason.</p> <p>Five years later, continued repression \u2013 including a clampdown on the media and foreign-funded NGOs, as well as a draconian anti-terrorism bill \u2013 combined with a divided opposition to ensure that his ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front won 99.6% of votes. More opposition arrests followed these polls.</p> <p>Meles' personal popularity is, however, hard to gauge in a country in which the press and civil society are closely monitored. He has pledged to step down in 2015, but broke a similar promise in 2010.</p> <p>While in power, Meles has pursued a pragmatic course in a coffee-dominated economy, 30% of which is still propped-up by foreign aid. Ethiopia has seen impressive annual growth of about 9% over the last decade, with the number of rural schools and clinics increasing and child mortality dropping.</p> <p>Yet critics point out that villagers have been forcibly relocated to make way for foreign investors, and that widespread poverty and food insecurity are still prevalent.</p> <p>Meles has raised his international profile by representing Africa on the global stage, such as at the G8 and G20. He has maintained close ties with the US, with Washington benefitting from Addis Ababa's experience and intelligence in fighting Islamist networks.</p> <p>Meles supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and has allowed Washington to send drones into Somalia from its territory. Ethiopia itself sent troops into Somalia to fight anti-American Islamists between 2006 and 2009, and forms the backbone of the UN peacekeeping mission in Sudan's volatile Abyei region.</p> <p>Addis Ababa is also the largest African recipient of British aid. Meles has, however, avoided dependence on the west by obtaining Chinese assistance for building roads, railways, and dams, and championing a Chinese \"model\" of development.</p> <p>Meles has dominated domestic politics to the extent that a power vacuum on his departure seems certain. No other political figure has the stature to hold together the fractious ruling coalition. His deputy, since 2010, is Hailemariam Desalegn, an engineer who also serves as foreign minister. It is, however, unlikely that this succession will be smooth and much political uncertainty lies ahead.</p> <p>Meles has ruled Ethiopia without rival and, ultimately, will be remembered as a pragmatic autocrat.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Dr Adekeye Adebajo is the executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, South Africa, and author of The Curse of Berlin: Africa After the Cold War (Hurst, 2010)</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2012 to remove an incorrect reference to the Tigray People's Liberation Front waging a 30-year-war and to clarify that the opposition won 23 seats in Addis Ababa in 2005, rather than in the election overall.</p>",
  "<p><em>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done</em> \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing\" title=\"\">Alan Turing</a>.</p> <p>Every day we hear more and more about scarcity. We hear how the expected demands of an increasing global population will increase conflict over scarce resources. We hear that delivering against the growth plans of global companies and the expectations of a growing middle class will put pressure on <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/35571/icode/\" title=\"\">supplies of food</a>, water and the <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2012-01-future-scarce-metals.html\" title=\"\">rare metals</a> present in the goods we have grown to depend upon.</p> <p>We are fixated on the scarcity of valuable resources. In the coming decades, we are told, we will need to compete ever harder for smaller and smaller quantities of materials that we once treated as effectively limitless.</p> <p><strong>Limits to growth</strong></p> <p>The earth is an island of life floating in a pretty sterile sea of space. While we receive a daily bounty of <a href=\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/disted/ph162/l4.html\" title=\"\">84 Terawatts</a> of solar income every day, we get precious little else. Were we to receive new supplies of minerals or metals, they would likely arrive with a rather high delivery cost.</p> <p>It would be logical to organise ourselves in cognisance of these facts. However, our economic and industrial models do not recognise these parameters as part of their design principles. We are using resources which are only replenished over geological timescales, at a rate likely to give rise to intense scarcity. Our use of such resources, combined with the unsustainable harvesting of natural productivity, endangers the functioning of our life supporting ecosystems.</p> <p><strong>Who ate all the pies?</strong></p> <p>The west did. The pies that we ate were extravagant, wasteful and wonderfully tasty. How extravagant? Very - 80% of the world's resources are consumed by just <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/1999-10-12/us/9910_12_population.cosumption_1_global-population-worlds-scientists?_s=PM:US\" title=\"\">16% of the world's population</a>. Moreover, that consumption is highly wasteful; the US economy, for example, has been estimated to have a total material efficiency of between only <a href=\"http://www.natcap.org/images/other/NCchapter1.pdf\" title=\"\">1% and 10%</a>.</p> <p>The pies we have been enjoying are going to become increasingly scarce and expensive in the coming years and more people have equally justified expectations of being able to enjoy them. We either need to stop eating pies or change the recipe.</p> <p><strong>On a crowded planet, scarcity is of limited utility</strong></p> <p>As the churn through vital resources gets ever faster, we become necessarily more and more fixated on scarcity and the perverse relationship between scarcity and value grows ever stronger. Yet scarcity is pretty useless if you have big plans so we need to break the link between scarcity and price. Scarcity may be very powerful economically, but it is of very limited value for a future that includes 9 billion people, all seeking the material and financial wellbeing and security that those of us lucky enough to be born in the west have grown to consider as our birth right.</p> <p><strong>It is not a viable business strategy</strong></p> <p>Basing technology on recognisably scarce resources and materials makes no business sense either. What rational business would on the one hand make plans for growth in the production and supply of products and services, while on the other hand building those technologies and services using resources that are not abundant or safe enough to meet these growth targets? Surely such an inherent contradiction should be of prime concern to company leaders and investors?</p> <p><strong>But scarcity does exist, it can't be denied</strong></p> <p>Of course scarcity exists but the risk that scarcity poses to our ambitions in business, economic and quality of life terms depends almost entirely upon how we undertake the following:</p> <p>\u2022 Focus on the sustainable use and continued re-use of scarce resources.</p> <p>\u2022 Prioritise the use of abundant and renewable resources.</p> <p><strong>Abundance is so tomorrow</strong></p> <p>Scarcity is a fundamental component of the derivation of price. Current economics uses the scarcity of a good or service to determine its price through a combination of supply and demand.</p> <p>However, price has failed to adequately equate to value \u2013 the value of the natural systems that support life has been treated as an externality and largely ignored.</p> <p>Scarcity may provide a simple and effective way of generating price but it is fatally flawed as an approach to delivering a sustainable future on a populated planet. Abundance is a far more valuable criterion for informing price than scarcity.</p> <p><strong>Delivering abundance</strong></p> <p>In this context, abundance is either a natural aspect of a resource, good or service, or can be achieved through the sustainable management of non-renewable resources, thereby suggesting two forms of abundance: literal and functional.</p> <p><strong>Literal abundance</strong></p> <p>Literal abundance is just that, a good or resource that depends upon components which are naturally abundant, or which can be derived amply through sustainable production and stewardship approaches.</p> <p>Ecosystems run on abundance, not on scarcity or even efficiency. Natural systems produce material in abundance and wastage provides feedstock for other parts of the system. Basing our technological and industrial models upon these types of raw materials and flows would allow us to operate without the conventional limits to growth which currently constrain us.</p> <p>Technologies are starting to exploit such resources, including the use of materials such as hemp for making body panels on cars, microalgae for producing jet fuel and bacteria to extract precious metals from waste.</p> <p><strong>Functional abundance</strong></p> <p>Functional or technical abundance, though often under another name, is a relatively recognised concept. <a href=\"http://www.mcdonough.com/cradle_to_cradle.htm\" title=\"\">In their cradle to cradle concept</a>, McDonough and Braungart talk of a \"technical cycle\" where scarce and potentially harmful materials are cycled endlessly through closed loop industrial models.</p> <p>The concept is echoed in the developing circular economy approach. The focus of the <a href=\"http://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Ellen MacArthur Foundation</a>, the circular economy seeks to design industrial models based upon stewardship and symbiosis, where the waste of one process becomes the feedstock of another.</p> <p><strong>There is much distance left to travel</strong></p> <p>While many of the technologies and approaches needed to build our economies upon abundance exist, some require vast efforts of research, development and investment in order to discover, implement and scale technologies that can deliver performance and utility to the whole of the world's population.</p> <p><strong>Vital technologies - the next industrial revolution</strong></p> <p>Our technologies and production processes must take a step from the realms of science fiction to crack the mysteries of nature, to mimic the elegance, simplicity and safety of biological production.</p> <p>We call such production \"lifelike vital technologies\", those which borrow from, and harness, biological production techniques, including: ultra-low energy growth, abundant degradable production and room temperature chemical and material production.</p> <p>Such approaches are not just fiction; biomimicry seeks to learn from and adapt design techniques from nature and even more revolutionary, significant investments are starting to be poured into advanced approaches to using biology for technological and industrial production.</p> <p><strong>Defeating the tyranny of scarcity</strong></p> <p>Scarcity makes us think small at a time when we should be thinking big. Scarcity makes us fight for our share of the scraps when our planet's life could support us in sharing abundance. Scarcity fills us with fear when we need to grow our hope.</p> <p>It is time to defeat the tyranny of scarcity and to truly value abundance.</p> <p><em>Joss Tantram is partner, corporate sustainability at Terrafiniti LLP.

  "<p>Some people think of <a href=\"http://smule.com/\">Smule</a> as a maker of novelty music apps like Ocarina, I Am T-Pain and Magic Piano \u2013&#xa0;which respectively involve blowing a virtual ancient wind instrument; tapping out songs on a curly touchscreen piano; and Auto-Tuning yourself to robo-rap.</p> <p>Some novelties. Smule's apps have been installed 61m times so far, and in July the company had 15m active users across its collection, with users having created more than 750m songs. </p> <p>Magic Piano alone has notched up 21m installs and has 730k daily active users (DAUs), while AutoRap \u2013&#xa0;released in mid-July 2012 \u2013 already has 3m installs and 350k DAUs.&#xa0;The caveat, as with many social/apps companies, is that it's unclear how all this usage is turning into revenues for the company.</p> <p>Even so, 15m active users for a firm that, according to co-founder Ge Wang, has been trying to \"help the democratisation of music\" since its first app in 2008.</p> <p>\"When we first started doing this, no one really knew what music apps meant, or what apps really meant,\" says Wang. \"We were just going for it! Now we feel more like we understand it\u2026\"</p> <p>Smule has raised $25.5m over four rounds of funding since 2008, and in December 2011 drove a spot of consolidation, buying fellow music apps developer Khush \u2013&#xa0;which had itself had hits with apps like LaDiDa and Songify.</p> <p>Prerna Gupta, Khush's chief executive who now works at Smule, says the two companies shared an ethos from the start.</p> <p>\"The goal was to make music creation accessible to people who don't have the ability to take music lessons. Our belief is that every human is musical,\" she says.</p> <p>Both Gupta and Wang offer similar explanations for their beliefs: the idea that music was once a fundamental form of human communication, but that in the era of recorded music, it became something to consume rather than create for the vast majority of people.</p> <p>\"There was no 'Am I a musician? Am I talented?',\" says Gupta of the pre-recordings era. \"People would just come home every day from work, get together and make music with their family and friends. We want to take technology and bring that back.\"</p> <p>The company's newest app is called <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sing!-join-global-karaoke/id509993510?mt=8\">Sing!</a> and has just been released for iOS. It's a logical step on from the company's earlier app Glee Karaoke, helping people to sing songs alone, in pairs or in groups, adding vocal filters, connecting to Facebook friends and listening to other people's efforts.</p> <p>The songs come from a variety of artists \u2013&#xa0;more than 100 at launch including big pop acts like Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and Carly Rae Jepsen.</p> <p>Like some of the company's previous apps, Sing! uses a spinning globe interface for its social listening feature. This time, though, it's the homescreen of the app, rather than placed behind a menu option.</p> <p>\"Our goal has been all about making music creation more accessible to people, but sometimes they just don't feel confident,\" says Gupta.</p> <p>\"By putting the globe and the social features up front, and showing them people all over the world \u2013&#xa0;some of whom are good and some of whom are\u2026 not so good \u2013&#xa0;it really reduces the intimidation factor.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394406481\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344421413753/sing.jpg\" alt=\"Sing by Smule\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smule's Sing! app puts its social features front and centre</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Talking of intimidating, Smule is one of the developers forging relationships with the music industry: not just record labels, but music publishers too.</p> <p>To gauge the achievement in getting so many licensed tracks into AutoRap and Sing!, for example, collar a music lawyerand ask about the complexities of licences for apps that not only involve users exchanging virtual credits for songs, but which also let them create new versions of those tracks and share them on social networks.</p> <p>\"It's not a walk in the park, but we're starting to see a shift,\" says Gupta. \"People are starting to understand that this is not something that is cannibalising sales of the music.\"</p> <p>On the one hand, Smule's apps are a potential new revenue stream for artists, labels and publishers. On the other, though, it's part of that wider democratisation threat to the established music industry.</p> <p>\"We work with the music industry. We don't see ourselves as a competitor trying to take them down,\" says Gupta. \"And yet I can see why we may seem threatening to them, because the whole thing about recording technology has been to create this hierarchy where a very small percentage of people are professional musicians and controlling the content.\"</p> <p>She stresses that Smule isn't trying to suggest that anyone can become a professional musician by using its apps. An obvious parallel is with Instagram, which is about the joy of creating and sharing beautiful images, rather than suggesting anyone can be a professional photogapher.</p> <p>Even so, Wang hopes that if the main impact of music recording technology has been to concentrate music-making in a small percentage of the population, Smule and its apps are a part of the trends that could reverse that.</p> <p>If there's that desire in all of us to be musical, then if technology changed behaviour one way, we may be at a crossroads of using technology to pass into that part of ourselves once again,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We're very happy to see things moving away from the perception that you have a few individuals producing music and the rest of us consuming it. The lines are being blurred, and we want to help that happen even more.\"</p>",
  "<p>The bid to take American electricals retailer Best Buy private could trigger the end of its joint venture with Carphone Warehouse and net a \u00a3660m profit for Charles Dunstone's business.</p> <p>Dunstone sold 50% of Carphone Warehouse Europe, which owns his stores in the UK and on the continent, to Best Buy for \u00a31.1bn in 2008. The two also have a profit-sharing agreement to create a chain of mobile phone stores in China and Mexico.</p> <p>But if Best Buy's former chairman Richard Schulze succeeds in a bid unveiled this week to buy out the company he founded, a clause in its deal with Carphone Warehouse would allow Dunstone to buy back the half of his business.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal with Best Buy, Dunstone has an option to buy the 50% stake back at \"fair market value\" if there is a change of ownership at Best Buy. Exane BNP Paribas bank puts that number at \u00a3600m, which at today's exchange rates is \u00a3500m less than Best Buy originally paid.</p> <p>With a guaranteed 10% discount, regaining full control could cost Dunstone just \u00a3540m.</p> <p>The break clause also gives him the option to sell his share of the two companies' Global Connect venture. Exane estimates Best Buy would pay as much as \u00a3100m for the mobile phone shop business.</p> <p>\"In our view it is highly likely under this scenario that Carphone would want to take up these options,\" said Exane analyst Ben Spruntulis. He added that Dunstone and his chief executive, Roger Taylor, already had a \"strong track record of undertaking value-enhancing transactions with Best Buy\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Carphone said: \"We do not comment on rumour and speculation. Our commitment to our relationship remains as strong as ever.\" Best Buy may welcome the cash generated by exiting its European venture. The retailer is struggling to compete with online rivals like Amazon, prompting Schulze's bid to organise a private equity buyout.</p> <p>The founder and former chairman has written to the company saying that he is in talks with top-flight private equity firms and that his financial adviser, Credit Suisse, is \"highly confident\" it could arrange the necessary debt financing.</p> <p>The contract with Carphone contains break clauses from 2015 onwards. These clauses can be brought forward should either partner be taken over by a company that is not majority controlled by the founders, Schulze and Dunstone.</p> <p>If Schulze succeeds in his bid to acquire Best Buy, he is unlikely to retain majority control. He has offered to put just $1bn of equity into the deal, with the rest raised from private equity firms and the debt markets. This would give him around 25% of the new company \u2013 not enough to claim control.</p> <p>Carphone may also want to end the relationship because it has been looking to form a partnership with other retailers, namely Media Markt in the Netherlands.</p>",
  "<p>Managers at Edinburgh airport appear to have been learning the intricacies of public relations at the feet of Argyll and Bute council, quickly if belatedly reading the chapter marked: The Lessons of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/jun/15/school-meals-blogger-council-ban\">Martha Payne</a>. </p> <p>With all the deftness of a fully-laden Boeing 747, the airport today executed a sharp u-turn on their decision on Tuesday to cover up and then ban a poster carrying a widely-celebrated nude by Picasso from their international arrivals lounge.</p> <p>This morning, courtesy of the Times, it emerged that the airport's new owners Global Infrastructure Partners had reacted very hastily to a handful of complaints about a large advert for a new Edinburgh festivals exhibition featuring Picasso's Nude Woman in a Red Armchair, which went up there last week.</p> <p>Apparently, the nude's bare breasts \u2013 the poster was deliberately positioned in prime site near the arrivals gate - were regarded by at least one woman passenger (and others) as not the kind of welcome she expected in Scotland. So the airport placed a white vinyl cover over the offending area, as a temporary measure before it was removed. </p> <p>Buying that site was the biggest single item of marketing expenditure by National Galleries of Scotland for their new exhibition <a href=\" http://www.nationalgalleries.org/whatson/exhibitions/picasso-modern-british-art\">Picasso and Modern British Art </a>which opened on 4 August at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in time for this month's Edinburgh festivals. </p> <p>John Leighton, director general of the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS), which runs the gallery, said the airport had also asked for it to be removed, and replaced with something less controversial. He was nonplussed by the controversy. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-19177968\">Speaking before</a> the airport relented, he said: </p> <blockquote> <p>It is obviously bizarre that all kinds of images of women in various states of dress and undress can be used in contemporary advertising without comment, but somehow a painted nude by one of the world's most famous artists is found to be disturbing and has to be removed.</p> <p>I hope that the public will come and see the real thing, which is a joyous and affectionate portrait of one of Picasso's favourite models, an image that has been shown around the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>There were several reasons why Leighton was taken aback. The image had been used heavily and without complaint on the London underground for the same show at Tate Britain earlier this year. And it was given prior approval by the airport's managers and their advertising company JC Decaux. </p> <p>Happily for the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh airport has learnt the lessons which Argyll and Bute council did back in June when they banned the now world-famous and celebrated <a href=\"http://neverseconds.blogspot.co.uk/\">Neverseconds blog</a> on school dinners by their pupil Martha Payne, and then lifted the ban in less than 24 hours.</p> <p>The National Galleries of Scotland had been now wrestling with what to do next: the advert took up a large chunk of the advertising budget for the Picasso and Modern British Art exhibition, and there is little time and money left to get approval from the Picasso estate to find a suitably strong new Picasso to replace it. A spokeswoman explained: </p> <blockquote> <p>The problem is that the Picasso estate has control over the majority of images in the show, and it would be quite a lengthy period of time to get that approval. We'd only just got that ad placed at the airport for the month so it's quite frustrating for that reason.</p> </blockquote> <p>Apparently it was all down to \"confusion\" at the airport. </p> <p>In a statement issued on Wednesday afternoon, an airport spokeswoman said:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>We have now reviewed our original decision and reinstated the image. The initial decision was a reaction to passenger feedback, which we do always take seriously. However on reflection we are more than happy to display the image in the terminal and we'd like to apologise - particularly to the exhibition organisers - for the confusion.</p> <p>As well as returning the image to its original display we also hope that the interest assists in further promoting the Picasso and Modern British Art exhibition at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art to the many visitors in Edinburgh at the moment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leighton has had one wish granted. He said before the ban was lifted he hoped the public \"will come and see the real thing, which is a joyous and affectionate portrait of one of Picasso's favourite models\". Thanks to the airport, word of the exhibition is, metaphorically at least, now flying around the world. But then Martha could've told anyone that. Her site has now had more than 7.6 million hits.</p>",

  "<p>Peru is among the richest mineral nations in the world and it seems as if everyone wants to tap into its immense wealth. Much of the Andean and coastal areas, from north to south, are divided into allotments loaned to mining companies to exploit. In one southern region alone, Apur\u00edmac, mining concessions account for 58.8% of the land; in Cajamarca in the north, home to the largest gold mine in Latin America, they cover 48% of the total territory.</p> <p>But this land is not an unpopulated sand desert where nothing grows. Most Peruvians live in the very rural areas from which tons of gold, zinc, tin and lead are extracted year after year, often with social and environmental consequences. This year alone, 10 people were killed in anti-mining protests in three Peruvian regions, following clashes with the police. The most recent deaths, in Cajamarca in early July, came after months of opposition to the construction of a multibillion-dollar gold mine, which residents are worried will leave the agricultural and cattle-ranching area without water.</p> <p>Mining can bring jobs and wealth to whole regions. <a href=\"http://www.newmont.com/south-america/ops-minas-conga-peru\" title=\"\">Newmont, a US company involved in the gold project in Cajamarca</a>, stresses its mineral extraction would not jeopardise the environment. But as the protests continue, all parties involved in trying to find a way out of this and other mining conflicts \u2013 that is to say, the central and regional governments, the mining companies, and local residents \u2013 say they are ready to build a new relationship based on trust and respect.</p> <p>\"We need to design and implement a new approach to the relationship that mining activities have with the environment and the exploitation of natural resources, based on a balanced management of the land and a rational use of water resources,\" said President Ollanta Humala <a href=\"http://www.presidencia.gob.pe/ollanta/blog\" title=\"\">during his address to the nation on 28 July</a>.</p> <p>Days earlier, a Newmont executive in Lima, Carlos Santa Cruz, reiterated his company's intention \"to listen, to dialogue and to build together more opportunities for everybody\". And in Cajamarca, a local protest leader, Edy Benavides, spoke about the need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. \"What mining companies do is exploit the mineral and then leave,\" he said. \"What we need is development that is sustainable for future generations.\"</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.minem.gob.pe/descripcion.php?idSector=1&amp;idTitular=4914\" title=\"\">the Peruvian government set up a permanent commission aimed at fostering this new relationship</a>. It is yet to make its proposals, but Jos\u00e9 de Echave, who resigned last year from the ministry of the environment due to the government's handing of the Cajamarca protests, says the commission needs to realise that in Peru, as elsewhere, it is possible to mine without leaving a negative impact on residents and the environment.</p> <p>\"In any serious country in the world with lots of natural resources, the government's environment authority is strong, puts into place strong regulations and strongly sanctions companies that pollute,\" he said. \"In Peru, we are not asking for something out of proportion.\"</p> <p>De Echave believes the Andean country can implement tough environmental laws, like Australia's or Canada's, without fearing that mining companies will flee. Mineral prices are high and deposits harder to find, so he believes multinationals will adapt to stricter conditions. \"What's more, if one looks at their ethical codes of conduct, they say that their operations always meet the best global standards,\" he says.</p> <p>De Echave is now a spokesman for <a href=\"http://tierraylibertadprensa.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tierra y Libertad (Land and Freedom), a political movement that aims to protect human and environmental rights</a> and has sent a letter to President Humala urging him to promote better international standards and sustainable development. \"It can't just be all about economic growth,\" he says. \"There are three factors to development: economic, social and environmental. All of these need to work together.\"</p> <p>But De Echave recognises that, by nature, mining does not exploit a sustainable resource. \"I think the idea is to find a balance,\" he concludes, \"so that mining can be complemented by other economic activities that may be relevant, meaningful, sustainable and, perhaps, more friendly to nature and social environments.\"</p> <p>Humala says he also wants this and is seeking congressional support to make access to water a fundamental human right inscribed in the constitution. The proposal aims to protect natural resources such as water from predatory and uncontrolled mineral exploitation.</p> <p>Critics say these announcements alone are not enough, arguing a radical change to how mining companies operate in Peru is necessary. Regions such as Huancavelica and Cajamarca sit on mineral riches but, despite experiencing decades of exploitation, their residents are the poorest in the country. With fewer resources around, and continuing social conflict, De Echave says change will be painful to implement, but now seems inevitable.</p>",

  "<p>Rio Tinto is closing one of its coal mines and considering whether to cut spending on new projects in 2013 after reporting a 22% slump in first-half profits to $5.04bn (\u00a33.2bn) on the back of a slowdown in Chinese demand.</p> <p>The Blair Athol mine in central Queensland, Australia will shut in the next three months with the loss of about 140 jobs. Chief executive Tom Albanese said overall capital expenditure next year may be lower. But Rio is avoiding the immediate cuts announced by its rivals, holding current year spending at $16bn on new mines, despite witnessing what it described as \"challenging conditions\" in the first six months of the year.</p> <p>\"While we are mindful of short-term uncertainties, we remain convinced of the strength of long-term demand outlook,\" said chairman Jan du Plessis. \"We have taken a considered approach to investment, committing capital only to projects that will deliver value for shareholders under any probable macroeconomic conditions.\"</p> <p>This confidence \u2013 and financial results which were slightly better than analysts forecast \u2013 drove Rio shares up by almost 2% to 3,192p. It unveiled net income down 22% while underlying profits, excluding derivatives and tax-related items, were down 34% to $5.25bn.</p> <p>About 80% of the profits come from iron ore, an ingredient in steel-making and central to the fast-track industrial modernisation programme going on in China. The price of iron ore exports from Australia to the world's most populous nation has fallen by almost 35% in little more than a year, triggering nervousness among Rio investors.</p> <p>Albanese said it was still right to plough $3.7bn more into expanding its Pilbara ore projects, saying that Rio's order book was full at a time China was still proceeding with about 500 major infrastructure schemes this year and next, but he also said in a conference call that 2013 spending may be lower.</p> <p>Rio has been trying to diversify to reduce its exposure on iron ore. It is already a producer of copper and coal, mining coal continuously from the Blair Athol facility near Clermont for more than 30 years. The companyIt has talked about the potential closure of the mine since 2005 as coal prices fell, but the boom in demand for use in Chinese power stations caused a rethink.</p> <p>Dawid Pretorius, general manager for the Clermont region at Rio, said it was time to end a mine sustained in recent times by relatively poor quality seams. \"Unfortunately the recent significant drop in thermal coal prices and other factors such as rising costs and the foreign exchange rate mean this is no longer a feasible option \u2026 We expect it [closure] will be before December.\"</p> <p>The decision comes a week after rival BHP Billiton said it would be cutting back on its $80bn worth of capital expenditure it had earmarked up until 2015 while Xstrata has reduced spending this year by $1bn.</p> <p>There has been intense speculation that BHP will postpone by up to two years a massive $19bn project to expand the Port Hedland harbour in Western Australia for increased iron-ore shipments.</p> <p>There have also suggestions that the go ahead for an even larger, $30bn, Olympic Dam uranium and copper mine expansion in South Australia will also be put back. BHP insists no firm decisions have yet been made but it admits the Port Hedland scheme is under review.</p> <p>The ambitions of Australian mining operations have all been hit by a commodity slump driven by China's gross domestic product growth falling from 9.2% last year to 7.6% in the second quarter of 2012 \u2013 the slowest pace for three years \u2013 plus a wider slowdown in the global economy.</p>",
  "<p>Over the last 30 years we have seen an explosion of public art in our towns and cities. Art works have become an essential part of every new housing estate, out of town supermarket or local park. Some have speculated that we have seen more publicly sited pieces in the last few years than through the whole of the last great explosion of public art, namely the Victorian era.</p> <p>And within this ever expanding collection of work, one thing is clear: the quality is highly variable. Yes, there are the standout pieces, the works that inspire, those that help with engendering a sense of place \u2013 of community even \u2013 but if Guardian columnist Jonathan Jones is correct when he says that, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/feb/18/art\" title=\"\">\"art is language and public art is public speech,\"</a> then our conversation is at times horribly bland and self-reflective.</p> <p>One would expect that there is very little to link these pieces of art together as a whole, other than their location \u2013 public art is not an art form in itself. And yet a journey through any major town will reveal the \"common genotypes\" of public art: the bronze man on a horse (who is often unidentified); the large highly polished rock, the oversized Oldenburg-style object. These often lazy repetitive symbols decrease our attention to the built environment, allowing us to disengage from our public space, to ignore the world around us, to forget where we are.</p> <p>Perhaps it is the public art commissioning process that is to blame? Many have argued that it is selection by committee that results in so much obvious work, others that excessive health and safety regulation have contributed to it. Undoubtedly, the influx of National Lottery funds contributed to our ability to commission bland work \u2013 the funds were there, but perhaps the artistic options were not. All of these things are quite true, to an extent.</p> <p>Well, I am pleased to announce, after some investigation, that I may have found a cure to this illness afflicting our public spaces. In fact it's one I might have mentioned <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b015zm9b/Change_of_Art/\" title=\"\">before</a>.</p> <p>The problem is that there's no decommissioning process \u2013 there is no expiry date on any work being put in to an urban area. Why not? Everywhere else you see art, from the gallery or museum, the private collection, to the graffiti-laden wall, they consider its removal. Why is no thought given to the moment when it's time for a change of commissioned public art?</p> <p>Undoubtedly, when work is commissioned, it comes with the highest hopes for its appeal, and longevity. But for those works that do not receive all the love, why is there no process for their removal?</p> <p>And I think we can take this line of thought further. Why not allow for the replacement or rotation of tired or \"orphaned\" works, relocating sculptures to new public homes, where they might receive new attention and focus? If we created a database of art country-wide, we could allow works to be swapped around when the time was right and in doing so, keep our cities fresh and save a fortune in commissioning fees to boot. Not a bad plus in austerity Britain.</p> <p>I think this idea comes with another benefit. Perhaps by creating this artwork dating scheme, we can also introduce a healthy curatorial aspect that is sorely lacking in our towns. One of the main criticisms of much of our urban surround is the lack of oversight when commissioning work near other already sited works. Perhaps this is a method for introducing some much needed city-wide curation.</p> <p>This idea is not new; it's already happening on the <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/fourthplinth/\" title=\"\">Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square</a>, with good supportive noises coming from both the public and the art-choosers. There's even an historical precedent. Italians weren't afraid of moving their public art around, or retiring it and replacing it with something else. Donatello's Judith and Holofernes was moved around Florence three times between 1455 and 1505, before it was replaced with Michelangelo's David \u2013 it would certainly be possible to achieve a scheme like this.</p> <p>There are things to consider: new art needs to be commissioned, and new artists need to be able to create work for their city spaces. Clearly, a scheme like this shouldn't be a closed system, to the detriment of the arts. New ideas need to flow through the city, and into the scheme too.</p> <p>But there are so many ideas already here that have not been seen by a wide enough audience, or that through replacement and relocation can stimulate debate all over again. This is as much an opportunity to rearrange our house and find new treasures as it is about removing those things of which we have grown tired. Surely, it's got to be a healthier way forward, focusing on improving and refining our urban areas through a better use of what we already have.</p> <p>Now we are all agreed, let's start with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jul/06/olympic-art-review-london-2012?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">ArcelorMittal Orbit in the Olympic Park</a> \u2013 is there anyone who will swap one of their local works for this?

  "<p>Three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot said Vladimir Putin's Russia was the one on trial as they delivered closing arguments on Wednesday in a case seen as a key test of the powerful president's desire to crackdown on dissent.</p> <p>\"This is a trial of the whole government system of Russia, which so likes to show its harshness toward the individual, its indifference to his honour and dignity,\" Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 22, one of the trio on trial said in an impassioned statement. \"If this political system throws itself against three girls \u2026 it shows this political system is afraid of truth.\"</p> <p>The judge set 17 August as the day she would deliver a verdict against the women, charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred following an anti-Putin performance in a Moscow cathedral.</p> <p>Prosecutors have asked for a three-year sentence, arguing that the women sought to insult all of Russian Orthodoxy and denying they were carrying out a political protest.</p> <p>Tolokonnikova called the charges against them a \"political order for repression\" and denounced Putin's \"totalitarian-authoritarian system\", insisting Pussy Riot were an example of \"opposition art\".</p> <p>\"Even though we are behind bars, we are freer than those people,\" she said, looking at the prosecution from inside the glass cage where she and her two bandmates, Maria Alyokhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich, have spent the nine-day trial. \"We can say what we want, while they can only say what political censorship allows.</p> <p>\"Maybe they think it wouldn't be wrong to try us for speaking against Putin and his system, but they can't say that because it's been forbidden,\" she said, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the revolutionary words \"No Pasaran\".</p> <p>Couching their case in the long plight of political prisoners in the country, the three women urged Russians to reject Putin's system and embrace freedom.</p> <p>Alyokhina, 24, compared the trial to the Soviet Union's persecution of Joseph Brodsky, when the young poet was charged with being a \"social parasite\", becoming a global cause celebre that highlighted the government's farcical control over culture.</p> <p>\"We are not guilty \u2013 the whole world is talking about it,\" Alyokhina said, hours after Madonna became the latest, and biggest, star to come to the women's defence.</p> <p>\"I am not scared of you,\" Alyokhina told the court. \"I'm not scared of lies and fiction, or the badly formed deception that is the verdict of this so-called court. Because my words will live, thanks to openness.</p> <p>\"When thousands of people will read and watch this, this freedom will grow with every caring person who listens to us in this country.\"</p> <p>Lawyers for Pussy Riot have been expecting a guilty verdict and three-year sentence, but said that was called into question following the judge's delay in issuing her decision. Lawyer Nikolai Polozov said growing international attention, including recent messages of support from the likes of Madonna and Yoko Ono, had had their effect. \"To take a quick decision under such pressure is very dangerous for the authorities, so they've taken a time out,\" he told the Guardian. \"No matter what the verdict is, we have won,\" he added.</p> <p>Each woman ended her closing statement to <a href=\"http://www.telly.com/AFGW1?fromtwitvid=1\" title=\"\">loud applause</a> from the Russian journalists sitting in the courtroom.</p>",

  "<p>US startup Ouya made a splash from the very first day of its Kickstarter campaign <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/jul/10/ouya-android-games-console-kickstarter\">seeking $950k of funding</a> for a $99 Android games console. It raised $2.3m <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/jul/11/ouya-android-console-kickstarter-success\">in its first 24 hours</a>.</p> <p>Nearly four weeks later, Ouya has <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console\">raised $7.7m on the crowdfunding site</a>, with (at the time of writing) 15 hours still to go before its deadline. Once that elapses, though, the hard work really begins for the company as it tries to deliver on its promises, while aiming to disprove its vocal critics.</p> <p>As a reminder, Ouya will be an Android-based games console with a projected launch date of March 2013. It will be open to any developer that wants to make a game or app for it, and the company is promising that the console will be fully hackable too.</p> <p>Ouya has already provided a model for a successful Kickstarter campaign, announcing regular news and partnerships throughout its four-week funding drive.</p> <p>That includes a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2012/aug/08/onlive-partnership-ouya-approval-startup\">partnership with cloud gaming service OnLive</a>, which is promising hundreds of streaming console games for Ouya. Publishers like Square Enix and Namco Bandai have pledged their support, as well as indie developers U4iA and Robotoki \u2013&nbsp;both launched by veterans of Activision's Call of Duty franchise.</p> <p>Ouya is working with open source media player XBMC, and has secured partnerships with TuneIn, Vevo and iHeartRadio from the entertainment space, hinting at its ambitions to go beyond games \u2013&nbsp;a wider trend that's already evident for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.</p> <p>Along the way, Ouya has drawn a lot of criticism too, including concerns that the rootable console will foster piracy; the difficulty of making a device like this for $99; questions about the company's plans for its app store and global marketing; and the suggestion that even if Ouya is a success, larger TV manufacturers could simply squash it by building in similar functionality to their products.</p> <p>Having <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/jul/10/ouya-android-games-console-kickstarter\">interviewed Ouya chief executive Julie Uhrman</a> just before the Kickstarter campaign launched, I talked to her again at the start of its final week about some of the bouquets and brickbats coming Ouya's way, and about its plans for the future.</p> <h2>Early feedback</h2> <p>\"We are truly excited and blown away by the support: it's amazing how well an open, affordable, accessible games console has resonated with gamers and developers,\" she says.</p> <p>\"A lot of people were surprised that we wanted to do something as audacious as taking on the console industry, which hasn't changed much for 20 years with its closed platforms and content that costs more than anywhere else. But people are really excited about somebody wanting to buck the trend.\"</p> <p>In truth, there is no shortage of disruptions to that traditional industry: smartphone and tablet gaming on one side, and Facebook social games on the other.</p> <p>Ouya's hope is that it can combine two of the key elements of both those sectors \u2013&nbsp;free-to-play games and much lower barriers to entry for developers \u2013&nbsp;and make them as much of a success on televisions as they have been on other devices.</p> <p>\"People started asking 'if this is possible, why hasn't it been done before by a large corporation?',\" says Uhrman. \"But sometimes the simplest ideas are staring you in the face, and they escape people.\"</p> <p>Uhrman accepts that Ouya hasn't provided details of its business model and launch plans as full as its critics (both constructive and less so) would have liked.</p> <p>\"We're running a business: we're not Charlie Sheen on a media blitz,\" she says. \"We're building our business in front of people. But that allows us to have a two-way conversation with our audience, and incorporate their feedback before we finalise the development.\"</p> <h2>Piracy fears</h2> <p>What about the feedback on piracy? Android is already a platform that sparks lots of debate about high levels of piracy \u2013&nbsp;even though the phenomenon exists on rival platforms like iOS as well.</p> <p>Will a rootable console automatically lead to piracy at a level that makes it difficult for developers to turn a profit on Ouya? </p> <p>\"Developers understand what we're doing, and those questions haven't been coming from them,\" says Uhrman. That's debatable: a number of developers have raised piracy as one reason to be cautious about Ouya when I've asked them, although none have seen it as a deal-breaker.</p> <p>But Uhrman goes on to make a good point about Ouya's focus on free-to-play games. Every title available through the console's store will be free to download initially, with developers then free to make money however they like: upgrades to paid versions, in-app purchase (IAP) for virtual items, subscriptions and so on.</p> <p>\"Piracy is one of the reasons we chose the free-to-play model,\" she says. \"You don't see piracy on Facebook games, or on free-to-play games [on mobile].\"</p> <p>Yes and no. Yes, in that a free-to-play focus means any piracy of game clients for Ouya simply widens the funnel of players who may then pay for stuff in-game.</p> <p>However, this simply shifts the scrutiny onto the security of whatever payment mechanisms are being used for in-app purchases in these games. As Apple recently found out, IAP systems aren't uncrackable. Ouya will need to choose its payment and security partners carefully.</p> <h2>TV competition</h2> <p>One of the most interesting criticisms of Ouya <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/08/01/this-is-ouyas-fatal-flaw/\">came from Forbes journalist Erik Kain</a>, who claimed that the console's \"fatal flaw\" was the risk that large TV manufacturers who are already involved in the Android ecosystem \u2013&nbsp;he cited Samsung \u2013&nbsp;could build similar technology into their TVs and kick the legs out from under Ouya's business and developer ecosystem.</p> <p>And when I put this question to Uhrman, in a slightly rambling way, I stumble on a different but related question: couldn't Ouya be the technology that gets built into televisions rather than existing as a standalone console?</p> <p>There's a very long pause.</p> <p>\"Building a great gaming ecosystem is about more than the console,\" she says. \"We always believed that the console would die away and become a chipset on the television. But you still need a great, responsive controller and a gaming ecosystem with great developers and great games.\"</p> <p>But? \"Ouya could be in a TV. Right now we are focused on building a great business around gamers and games, and right now we have to be a console connected to a television. That's where the biggest reach and biggest audience is. Who knows what the future holds? We'll have the best suite of content, and the best controller on the market\u2026\"</p> <p>That long pause makes sense. What Ouya doesn't need right now are opportunistic headlines suggesting it plans to get out of the console market and into TVs as soon as it can \u2013&nbsp;especially when its future depends on lots of people pre-ordering its first-generation console.</p> <p>But it's clear there could be a future for Ouya as an open, Android-based gaming platform for connected TVs, likely via partnerships with manufacturers. And that's potentially even more disruptive in the grand scheme of things than a $99 games console \u2013&nbsp;although such partnerships may bring their own challenges to Ouya's open ethos.</p> <p>Those debates are for the future. In the meantime, Ouya has a final funding push to complete, and a business to build.</p> <p>\"We're thrilled by the level of enthusiasm and support so far, but we're also focused on building a great product, delivering it in March 2013, and continuing to work on more great content for launch,\" says Uhrman.</p>",
  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>You remember hockey. It was the one lesson at school where everyone was actually encouraged to carry a lethal weapon. You can still feel those blows on your knuckles whenever the weather turns cold. And sometimes, late at night, you remember the time you were forced to go in goal. </p> <p>You'll be pleased to learn, therefore, that hockey is a game also played by sane adults in a properly regulated environment. It's a sport that, despite Britain standing fourth in both men and women's world rankings, doesn't enjoy a massive following over here \u2013 possibly because it's quite difficult to see the ball on TV. It's easier to see when you're playing, promise. Now hold this stick. You can go in goal first.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>Hockey is contested by two teams of 11 \u2013 organised into defence, midfield and attack \u2013 on a pitch of grass or astroturf at either end of which stands a seven-foot-high goal. You run, you dribble, you hit, you try and score. Other than that it's mainly a list of don'ts: no kicking the ball, obstructing players or swinging the stick too high. If you're tackled, you cannot immediately resume dribbling. Also, you must hit wherever possible with the flat edge, which is on the front of the stick when swinging from right to left (though the stick can be reversed for a shot on the opposite side). Bad news for southpaws: left-handed sticks are not permitted in regulation play. This is a sport popularised by the Victorians, after all, and they thought left-handers were evil. Which they aren't. <em>Are they?</em></p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>Aside from helping you develop really hard knuckles, hockey works the CV system, builds upper- and lower- body strength and improves coordination and teamworking abilities. Strengthening your core muscles can help prevent the back pain that might arise from the bent-over position of play.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>A decent stick can be yours for about \u00a350, though prices go much higher, while bespoke hockey shoes (very like astroturf boots) come in at a little less. Most hockey clubs accept beginners, who will be assigned an appropriate team and/or training session after a trial. Or to get started, you could try <a href=\"https://www.rushhockey.co.uk/whatisrushhockey.aspx\">rush hockey</a>, a five-a-side format played on smaller pitches, which works on a \"pay and play\" basis if you can't muster up a team.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 5/10</h2> <p>Hockey still carries the whiff of public school repression and/or comprehensive school depression. Though don't tell the man with the stick I said that.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Lawrence West, England Hockey:</strong> \"A fun and sociable team sport, hockey is a great all-round workout, boosting cardiovascular fitness and toning major muscle groups such as your core and legs. Until 2 September, GB Hockey is running its <a href=\"http://www.hockeynation.info/\">Hockey Nation: Give It a Go programme</a> offering the public 20,000 opportunities to pick up and stick and try the sport at 500 sites around the country.

  "<p>Global miner Rio Tinto insists that China is about to start booming again - as it attempted to put a positive spin on a 34% drop in first-half profits.</p> <p>The mining sector has been hit by the economic struggles in major markets such as Europe, the US and China - as well as by rising labour and equipment costs - and those factors have now conspired to impact Rio as the world's second-largest iron ore producer joined rivals in reporting lower earnings.</p> <p>The miner said underlying profit fell 34% to $5.2bn (\u00a33.3bn), as a sharp drop in iron ore prices took its toll despite steady volumes.

  "<p>Walking just a mile from my apartment to my parent's house in Brooklyn, New York on Monday evening, I witnessed three bicyclists riding in an alarmingly dangerous manner: one nearly ran me over as he turned on a red light while I crossed a street; one was going the wrong way on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn's busiest street; and one forced me to wait to cross on a green light because he ran a red without even slowing down, much less stopping. By the time I was safely indoors, I had decided that New York City ought to start much more aggressively enforcing the traffic laws on bicycles. </p> <p>So, imagine my surprise when I got to my parents house, opened the New York Times Sunday Review, and saw that Randy Cohen, The New York Times Magazine's erstwhile \"ethicist\", had written <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/opinion/sunday/if-kant-were-a-new-york-cyclist.html\">an op-ed in favor of these irresponsible behaviors</a>. To be sure, Cohen did not endorse each of the foolish choices, but his distinctions between the ones he proudly engages in and all others are pure sophistry. Cohen writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I routinely run red lights, and so do you. I flout the law when I'm on my bike; you do it when you are on foot, at least if you are like most New Yorkers. My behavior vexes pedestrians, drivers and even some of my fellow cyclists \u2026</p> <p>\"But although it is illegal, I believe it is ethical \u2026 I roll through a red light if and only if no pedestrian is in the crosswalk and no car is in the intersection \u2013 that is, if it will not endanger myself or anybody else. To put it another way, I treat red lights and stop signs as if they were yield signs. A fundamental concern of ethics is the effect of our actions on others. My actions harm no one. This moral reasoning may not sway the police officer writing me a ticket, but it would pass the test of Kant's categorical imperative: I think all cyclists could \u2013 and should \u2013 ride like me.</p> <p>\"I am not anarchic; I heed most traffic laws. I do not ride on the sidewalk (OK, except for the final 25ft between the curb cut and my front door, and then with caution). I do not salmon \u2013 ie, ride against traffic.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Cohen's assertions rest on several false premises. The first is that only a physical injury to another person constitutes harming him or her. But Cohen himself admits that \"My behavior vexes pedestrians, drivers and even some of my fellow cyclists.\" Why is vexing someone not harming him? If you go around the city causing aggravation to your fellow citizens \u2013 whether by blasting loud music, disobeying traffic laws, littering, or whatever \u2013 you <em>are</em> causing harm to other individuals and to society as a whole. Whether or not you are behaving unethically, you are certainly behaving selfishly. </p> <p>And when a bicyclist nearly hits me, as they frequently do, I feel more than just vexed: I feel momentarily scared. Obviously, accidents are worse than near-accidents, but shouldn't bicyclists respect pedestrians enough not to frighten them by almost running them over?</p> <p>Second, Cohen makes totally meaningless distinctions and pretends that he is somehow limiting himself to only the ethical violations of the law and infringements on other people's space. Why is running a red light OK, but riding on the sidewalk or against traffic a step too far? Riding on the sidewalk is the same as running a red: you are entering the pedestrian's legal space on a fast-moving, heavy metal object. </p> <p>Suppose Cohen's personal rules do actually avoid harming anyone else. Why does he think that he has the right to decide which laws he follows and which he doesn't? Anyone can justify breaking the law in this way. How does Cohen know that every bicyclist who takes his advice will be as careful as he is to make sure no pedestrians are coming?</p> <p>Contrary to Cohen's assertion, he is indeed behaving anarchically \u2013 because the only natural endpoint of letting individuals decide which laws they will follow, and under what circumstances, <em>is</em> anarchy. </p> <p>Finally, Cohen argues that pedestrians jaywalking is just as dangerous, possibly even more so, as a biker running a red light. This is self-evidently absurd. To state the obvious, pedestrians do not move as quickly, and their bodies are not as hard, as bicycles. Also, isn't \"two wrongs making a right\" one of the most well-known of logical fallacies? If pedestrians are jaywalking right in front of bicyclists and causing collisions, or near collisions, they shouldn't be, and the police should ticket them, as well. </p> <p>Some bicyclists, such as Cohen, feel that \u2013 because biking is better for the environment than driving \u2013 they enjoy a superior moral status to everyone else and they are therefore entitled to flout traffic laws. (Cohen makes this argument by implication, with an extended riff on how driving is unethical because of its negative externalities such as pollution.) This is why one can defend such antisocial behavior in the New York Times. Can you imagine the Times publishing a defense of selectively violating laws against littering or playing loud music late at night? Of course not \u2013 because in any other realm vexing your neighbors by breaking the law is understood to be rude and unacceptable. </p> <p>What these self-righteous bikers fail to recognize is that New York is filled with fellow non-drivers who are seriously threatened by their behavior. It is, of course, better for the environment, public health and livable streets if more people bike and fewer drive. Public policies promoting biking instead of driving, such as creating bike lanes, are therefore commendable. But public support for these policies is undermined by bikers who threaten pedestrians, and even come up with ridiculous justifications, such as Cohen's, for doing so.</p> <p>If Cohen really wants to promote biking, he should obey the law, and urge his fellow riders to do the same.</p>",
  "<p>Olympic organisers may not be seeing anywhere near their ambition of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bike-blog/2012/jan/19/olympics-fans-bikes\" title=\"\">4,400 bikeborne visitors a day</a>, but plenty of people are cycling around the Olympic Park.

There should be more routes with complete separation.\" </blockquote> <p>Bel\u00e9n, Rub\u00e9n and Oalla from Madrid borrowed bikes from a friend in London, despite finding the fact that bikes share a lane with buses intimidating. They had to cycle because of the cost.</p> <blockquote> \"The underground here is four times as expensive as it is in Madrid \u2013 we're having a crisis in Spain, we can't afford to go by tube when we're here.\" </blockquote> <p>Yuko Motoyama also cited the cost of public transport as the reason for cycling while here, and was a big fan of the London cycle hire scheme, which doesn't have an equivalent in her native Tokyo. She was surprised at how many people wear helmets in London.</p> <blockquote> \"Usually Japanese people don't wear them, they're seen as uncool.\" </blockquote> <p>It's not just spectators that are cycling to the Games. When I met Daniel Schlang, part of Germany's first ever Olympic BMX team, he was riding down Stratford high street. Despite the fact that he's entitled to be driven around in the Games lanes, the 21-year-old athlete had forsaken his chauffeur driven car for his BMX on his way to a training session before the start of the competition today. It was all about speed and convenience for Schlang, from Cottbus, a small town near Berlin.</p> <blockquote> \"It's a little bit faster because there's a lot of traffic. The Olympic lanes are brilliant but I ride every day so I think I'm faster on the bike.\" </blockquote> <p>Schlang wasn't the only one choosing a bike over official Games transportation. Bori Csics\u00e1k, who had come over from Hungary to work in the park, bought a bike off the internet and was using it instead of the bus laid on by the organisers to get back to her lodgings. However, she was riding on the pavement down the high street.</p> <blockquote> \"I don't have the courage to ride on the road here, the traffic is scary.\" </blockquote> <p>Stopping in the bike park at the Greenway transport hub I got a free bike check from Anabel Sanchez. If only there were more free bike parks like this in London: secure, off the pavement and manned by several staff round the clock. Sanchez is pleased about the work she's doing.</p> <blockquote> \"There's not many bike shops in the area so it's nice that the Olympics gives some service to the locals. If you want to invite them to come by bike, you have to offer them support.\" </blockquote> <p>She mentions that one complaint she's heard a lot is that the bike parks are a long way from the venues \u2013 \"cyclists like to park right in front of where they're going\".</p> <p>David Hutchinson, a games maker from Norwich volunteering at the aquatics centre, agrees.</p> <blockquote> \"I wasn't impressed, being a volunteer and giving up all my time, that they didn't provide any cycle parking any nearer the venues \u2013 I have a half hour walk from here to the aquatics centre.\" </blockquote> <p>He says he feels safer in London, which has more bike lanes than Norwich, but is more wary of the drivers \u2013 \"they do come a bit close to you, and they're less considerate.\"</p> <p>Lemar Lewis, working for UPS in the park, had just taken up cycling for the Olympics.</p> <blockquote> \"Everyone's on the get-fit programme, plus it's quicker to my house.\" </blockquote> <p>It takes him 15 minutes to cycle to work, compared to 45 minutes by public transport. I ask him if he'll keep up the cycling after the Olympics:</p> <blockquote> \"Most definitely. I think it's the best way to get around London. They should put in a lot more bike lanes though \u2013 we need to start making some sacrifices. Oxford Street should be a no-car zone.\" </blockquote> <p>Hopefully his experience will be one that a lot of people have had over the past weeks, and his view echoes what I heard all day: we desperately need to improve conditions, but cycling is still the only way to get around London.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year Codemasters announced that, for the foreseeable future, it was going to concentrate exclusively on making racing games \u2013 which instantly piqued the interest of the car-obsessed sector of the gaming community and launched a specific topic of debate. In that case, the speculation went, the Leamington-based company will surely bring us new versions of all its four-wheeled franchises, so can we expect a new version of Grid?</p> <p>Now, it can be confirmed that Grid 2 is under development. It will arrive in summer 2013, on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 \u2013 and from what we have seen and played, should have what it takes to build considerably on the franchise's cult-classic reputation.</p> <p>Grid evolved from Codemasters' most simulation-oriented racing franchise, TOCA Race Driver (TOCA being the outfit that oversees the British Touring Car Championship). Race fans will be aware that the BTCC offers the most bruising, full-contact four-wheeled racing that anyone could crave, and Grid 2's predecessors reflected that, although the BTCC wasn't their main focus.</p> <p>You had to participate in a number of very different formulae, of which the likes of Formula Ford 2000, in which it was virtually impossible to corner without initiating a four-wheel drift, stood out. 2008's Grid dropped the official licence and concentrated on gritty, down-and-dirty racing across street and custom-built circuits, mostly in super-powerful rear-wheel-drive cars.</p> <p>Grid's standout aspect was the way in which it provided an emphatic antidote to the antiseptic, squeaky-clean nature of rivals such as the car-damage-averse Gran Turismo and particularly Microsoft's Forza. Everything in it looked a bit grease-stained and well-worn, and as a result, you could almost smell the petrol fumes when you played it.</p> <p>It was also the first driving game to let you rewind time (a feature much copied since), and was indeed one of the first games to come out for the Xbox 360. Now, as executive producer Clive Moody pointed out, its successor will be one of the last games for that console. Moody refused to be drawn into the likelihood of Grid 2 being upscaled for Microsoft and Sony's next generation of consoles.</p> <h2>So what is it like?</h2> <p>Before we could get our hands on the game, a procession of the men in charge of making various aspects of it talked us through their specialist areas. Moody kicked off by answering why it took Codemasters so long to make to a sequel for Grid.</p> <p>\"When we came into pre-production for Grid 2, it was clear that our ambitions were outstripping the technology and processes that we had, so we held back,\" he said.</p> <p>But at the end of the current console cycle, and having rewritten its driving game engine in recent years, Codemasters now feels ready. Moody set out Codemasters' overriding ambition for the game.</p> <p>\"We want to make the most immersive racing game that's out there, and within that, we want to provide the perfectly distilled racing experience,\" he said. \"It will take place on a real-world global stage, in US, European and Asian locations \u2013 there will be no fictional areas, and all the cars will be real-world ones.</p> <p>\"Players will be able to shape their own path through the game, although there will be overall goals. And their actions and successes will be reflected in a constantly evolving world.\"</p> <p>In practice, he said, that would mean that when you started off, you would have a one-man-and-his-dog support operation, but as you progressed, you would gain access to vast, well-equipped garages, sponsors would throw money at you, and so on.</p> <h2>Race and car variety</h2> <p>\"There will be three key types of race locations,\" Moody said. \"Firstly, street racing \u2013 tight, wheel-to-wheel affairs through iconic city streets [which will include Chicago and Paris].\"</p> <p>\"Next, there will be road-racing, which is new for the Grid franchise \u2013 taking the form of high-speed runs on open roads and long, sweeping highways, so you can put your foot to the floor for long periods. And the third element is track racing: it's still a really important part of the experience, taking in a selection of internationally renowned circuits including Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina.\"</p> <p>Associate producer Toby Evans-Jones talked us through the cars: \"There will be four tiers, based on performance, so you may see, for example, American muscle-cars versus European classics.</p> <p>\"The first tier will include the likes of the Ford Mustang Mach I and the E30-shape BMW M3 Sport Evo. Tier 2 will include the Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 and the [modern] Chevrolet Camaro SS, and will introduce traction and launch-control. In tier 3, you'll find the McLaren MP4-12C and the track-special BAC Mono. And tier 4 will consist of money-no-object cars like the Pagani Huayra and the Koenigsegg Agera R, with 1,140bhp.\"</p> <h2>Multiplayer</h2> <p>Associate producer Ian Smith stepped up to talk us through the multiplayer side of Grid 2.</p> <p>\"It's about redefining the multiplayer experience for racing games,\" he said. \"In the single-player journey, there's a lot of customisation possible, and it's about you telling your story. But the multiplayer experience will be more about what competitive players want to do.</p> <p>\"You'll start the multiplayer from scratch, and it isn't linked to the single-player XP system. It will be a fully emergent, social experience.\"</p> <p>Codemasters confirmed that Grid 2's multiplayer side would be built on Racenet, its answer to EA's much-loved Autolog, but beyond that, it remained annoyingly vague. Undoubtedly, it will reveal more about Grid 2's multiplayer experience as time unfolds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394386028\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344426914476/Grid-2-007.jpg\" alt=\"Grid 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grid 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hands-on</h2> <p>With the talking over, it was time for some hands-on play. And the good news is that, while Grid (and, for that matter, TOCA Race Driver) were all about car-feel, Grid 2 has somehow managed to up that particular ante even further.</p> <p>First up was a road-racing sequence on swooping Californian Pacific Coast Highway roads, which looked simply stunning with cliffs on your right (so you were heading south). We were at the wheel of a pumped-up Mustang with 500-odd bhp, racing against a similarly fast and tail-happy American beast.</p> <p>The experience was a bit like Nascar on real roads, which required precision braking and, especially, very fine throttle-control. This stage was played on a D-Box: a hugely expensive seat, wheel and controls rig with motors that move you around to simulate real car movement. The effect was dramatic, with simply unprecedented amounts of car-feel on offer.</p> <p>Thanks to the D-Box, it seemed as though you could actually feel individual tyres starting to break away from the road surface, and the Mustang's handling characteristics \u2013 initial understeer followed by throttle-on oversteer \u2013 came through clearer than we have ever before experienced in a game.</p> <p>The other track that we were able to play was experienced in a much less esoteric manner, simply using a joypad (although the game was actually running on PCs). Its backdrop was the streets of Chicago, and given that we were driving a pumped-up Mercedes AMG SL65 Black on a pretty twisty street-circuit (some parts of which even had a concrete central reservation), it took us a while to get tuned in.</p> <p>But again, the car feel on offer was immense, and we soon learned to almost back the Merc into corners, braking and turning in early, in the sort of style associated with World Superbikes riders.</p> <p>As well as looking amazing (Codemasters talked us through the graphical innovations in Grid 2's engine at length), the Chicago track gave us an insight into the game's AI. Essentially, you could describe it as do-as-you-would-be-done-by.</p> <p>So, if you tend to lean on the cars ahead as you try to pass around tight corners (as we did when we started playing), you can expect to fall victim to the odd shunt from the rear. Conversely, the cleaner you as regards the cars around you, the better they will behave.</p> <p>The AI was also noticeably realistic, in that some of the drivers it controlled did actually make tiny mistakes, allowing you to take advantage and nip through, which contrasts with the driving-game norm of being surrounded by drivers who appear to be clones of Ayrton Senna.</p> <p>Even though it's early days for Grid 2, what we've experienced of it so far bodes phenomenally well. The cars feel much more real than any we've ever experienced in a game \u2013 and that includes Gran Turismo 5 and, especially, Forza, which has always felt as though it was built in a laboratory by robots.</p> <p>It looks magnificent, yet still exudes a pungent virtual whiff of exhaust fumes. It should make a fitting last hurrah for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.</p>",
  "<p>By 2050, the world's population will have reached 9 billion. If all these people are going to have enough to eat, increases in food production and changes in consumer patterns of behaviour will both be needed. But what will these look like? And what's the best way to make them happen?</p> <p>To discuss these questions, Guardian Sustainable Business brought together a range of experts from across the food security and sustainable agriculture debate. The online panel included Richard Perkins, senior commodities adviser at environment charity WWF; Dawn Rittenhouse, director of sustainabilty for US chemicals firm DuPont; Louise Fresco, a sustainability expert at the University of Amsterdam; Justin Smith, head of sustainability at South African retailer Woolworths; Santiago del Solar, an Argentine agronomist and farmer; and Jan Kees Vis, global director sustainable sourcing development at consumer goods firm Unilever. Here's a summary of the six main themes:</p> <h2>Sharing knowledge</h2> <p>There's no one \"right\" model for farming. Farmers need to respond to local conditions, argued Louise Fresco of the University of Amsterdam. \"Farmers and business should liaise with communities to orient \u2026 production\", she pointed out. By the same token, farmers have a lot to learn from one another. Knowledge gaps are especially significant in the developing world, where tomorrow's hungry mouths will mostly be found. Why are rice yields so much lower in India than China, for example? So there's a strong case for sharing best practices. Yet warnings were voiced against imposing outside recommendations wholesale. As debate participant Robynne Anderson observed: \"scaling up in a farmer context is often best done through farmer organisations and extension services.\"</p> <h2>Measuring performance</h2> <p>Okay, so it might not sound like the most thrilling solution, but data matters. We can't analyse the problem without the right numbers. DuPont's Dawn Rittenhouse pointed towards a US programme called <a href=\"http://www.fieldtomarket.org/\">Field to Market</a> that has devised comparable outcome metrics for agricultural improvement projects. Woolworths is rolling out a similar approach across its agriculture suppliers. Farming for the Future operates within an 80-point audit protocol based on soil health. It's proven effective at \"reducing inputs, driving water efficiency, protecting biodiversity and maintaining or even growing yields\", Justin Smith remarked. A word of caution, however: adding to producers' paperwork won't be welcomed down on the farm. There's a multitude of certification schemes out there already: Tesco Nurture, Leaf, Organic, Freedom Food, and so forth. \"Too many standards, too many questions to farmers\", noted Unilever's Jan Kees Vis. Better to have one harmonised standard \u2013 albeit it's difficult to draw up.</p> <h2>Keeping it local \u2013 or not</h2> <p>The trope of our times - Think global, Act local \u2013 drew mixed responses. Received wisdom is that food miles are bad news. If we need to feed the world, we need to grow what we need on our doorsteps. Yet analysis by Unilever suggests only 2-3% of the global carbon footprint of your average food product comes from transport. WWF's Perkins conceded that the case for going local isn't as easy as it sounds. Sure, we want to avoid air-freighting food around the globe, but we also don't want to be growing carbon-heavy, out-of-season greenhouse crops just so that they are local. Instead, he suggested that it made sense to \"grow things where they grow best \u2026 and trade them\".</p> <h2>Reducing waste</h2> <p>Feeding 9 billion people by 2050 doesn't necessarily mean a revolution in agricultural productivity. Simply stopping waste in the food chain will get us a good way towards where we need to be. There's much to be done at the producer end, particularly with respect to post-harvest loses. DuPont's Dawn Rittenhouse cites the example of dairy farming in Kenya. Her company co-developed a new enzyme that slowed the spoilage of milk, thus preserving milk during transportation from the farm. Information technology can also play a role. Participants cited IT innovations like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23phones4farmers?q=%23phones4farmers\" title=\"\">#phones4farmers </a>and <a href=\"http://www.icow.co.ke/\" title=\"\">iCow</a>. Not all solutions need be high tech. Grain farmer Santiago del Solar noted how producers in his home country use huge plastic storage bags to make up for missing silos. \"It's an Argentinean solution\", he said, \"cheap and clean\".</p> <p>Reducing waste at the other end of the food cycle is equally important. Unilever's Jan Kees Vis argued that food should be affordable, not cheap, as \"cheap food leads to waste\". Business has a key role to play here. The new<a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/content/hospitality-and-food-service-wraps-work-0\" title=\"\"> UK Hospitality and Food Service Agreement</a> offers a prime example of an industry sector linking with government and non-profits to tackle the problem. Getting consumers to think about food use is the primary concern, however. That requires food retailers to get involved. \"I guess our role is also to focus on not promoting bulk purchases where this is unnecessary\", said Woolworth's Justin Smith. Discounting \"normal\" sized portions could be one solution. Information on production methods is also helpful, said Louise Fresco, but only if it's easy to understand.</p> <h2>Engaging youth</h2> <p>Food security is an issue that today's young people will become only too aware of. So engage them now in sustainable consumption, the panel agreed. On the consumer side, several participants called for more work in schools. UK supermarket Sainsbury's was cited for its work promoting gardening in schools. Don't forget tomorrow's farmers either. Young people need to be persuaded that farming can provide a viable future. For that to happen, it requires them to have the skills to farm efficiently, as well as the incentive of being paid fairly. Companies can contribute in both cases.</p> <h2>Collaborating together</h2> <p>If there was one message that rang our throughout the discussion, it was the need for collaboration. \"For emerging market businesses, much of the focus needs to be on creating partnership opportunities that bring more small scale farmers\", said Justin Smith. Matching small-scale suppliers with well-resourced primary suppliers is the kind of solution he had in mind. Jan Kees Vis had a word for the big players too: cooperation, not competition, has to be the watchword going forward. It's time to reaffirm sustainable agriculture as a \"pre-competitive issue\", he said. The time is also right to start \"re-connecting\" in supply chains: e.g. linking end users to primary producers. \"I have taken Unilever Board members to tea estates in Africa, to oil palm plantations in Malaysia, to tomato farms in Italy ... [This is] a necessary step to get to more collaboration.\"</p> <p>To read the whole discussion, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/feeding-world-nine-billion-population\" title=\"\">please click here</a>.</p> <p><em>This article forms part of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\" title=\"\"><em>Let's talk sustainable living</em></a><em>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making sustainable living mainstream.

  "<p>Forty-eight hours ago, Bobak Ferdowsi had fewer than 200 Twitter followers. This morning, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweetsoutloud\" title=\"\">he has almost 40,000</a>. Ferdowsi, also known as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/chat-with-bobak-ferdowsi-aka-mohawk-guy-and-stem-educations-new-dream-come-true/2012/08/07/b47e7360-e0d5-11e1-a19c-fcfa365396c8_blog.html\" title=\"\">\"Nasa Mohawk Guy\"</a>, became an internet sensation after his unusual hairdo caught the eye of those watching the Mars Curiosity landing on Nasa TV. Within hours, he was a trending topic on Tumblr and became a trending hashtag on Twitter. He's been immortalised in <a href=\"http://memegenerator.net/Nasa-Mohawk-Guy\" title=\"\">image macros</a>, <a href=\"http://fuckyeahbobakferdowsi.tumblr.com/image/28910715253\" title=\"\">comic fan art</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/cp/customize/product2.aspx?number=678774162\" title=\"\">T-shirts on Cafepress</a>. While his meteoric rise to fame may not be as remarkable as the Mars landing itself, it prompts the question: what is it about Bobak Ferdowsi that turned him into a meme?</p> <p>There is no magic formula when it comes to creating memes or making \"viral\" content. There are certainly ways to stack the deck: content that is humorous, incongruous, and/or part of the zeitgeist is likely to be spread through social networks more often than, say, a boring interview or advert. In looking at the top memes of the past several years, there are few discernible patterns that can be pulled out: some, like LOLCats, have become part of the meme canon; others, like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/23/pepper-spraying-cop-photoshop-justice\" title=\"\">Pepper Spray Cop</a>, became instant phenomena and faded away just as quickly.</p> <p>Ultimately, memes spread because on some level, they resonate with their audience: people share content that is meaningful to them in one way or another. When it comes to the most popular memes, that underlying meaning often differs across a variety of audiences. In his explanation of Susan Boyle's overnight success and transformation into a meme, Professor Henry Jenkins of USC Annenberg said: \"There's no need to identify a single cause for why people spread this content. Different people spread this content for different reasons.\"</p> <p>When it comes to Ferdowsi, the reasons why he has struck a chord seem to fall under one of three headings. One is that he is a \"hot nerd\". A majority of the tweets and coverage featuring Ferdowsi comment on his appearance, or women's reactions to his status as a \"sexy scientist\", including a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/06/bobak-ferdowsi-nasa_n_1749652.html#slide=1339801\" title=\"\">plethora of marriage proposals</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394514149\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344419589436/bobby4.jpg\" alt=\"bobby\" width=\"460\" height=\"451\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Second, there has been a large response from the Persian community. Ferdowsi is of Persian descent, and many Persians and Persian-Americans have tweeted about him, saying how proud they are that he represents their community, providing a positive image of Iranian-Americans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/shervin/status/232384357954879489\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Proud of Persian American Bobak Ferdowsi (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweetsoutloud\"><s>@</s><b>tweetsoutloud</b></a>)-NASA Curiosity Landing's Flight Director w/Mohawk <a href=\"http://t.co/kLYqWBHY\" title=\"http://lil.lu/QEpyRu\">lil.lu/QEpyRu</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23greathair\"><s>#</s><b>greathair</b></a></p>&mdash; Shervin Pishevar (@shervin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shervin/status/232384357954879489\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-06T07:55:23+00:00\">August 6, 2012</a></blockquote> <script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </figure>  <p>Most responses, however, celebrate the fact that Fedowsi is a nonconformist in a traditional environment: he breaks the stereotype of a Nasa scientist (arguably, the responses to his looks and his racial heritage apply to this as well). Courtney von Nieda, who runs a Tumblr that has been collating all of the fan reactions to Ferdowsi, explains that \"Bobak is compelling because you don't think young or individuality when you think Nasa. The mohawk is young and relatable. People enjoy being able to see someone like them doing great things like landing a robot on another planet using a crane and rockets.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Nay_yer/status/232389857522114560\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Nasa mohawk guy is persian!

Ferdowsi's look has provided people with a distinctive and widely recognised image, and the various elements that have resonated with different groups \u2013 his attractiveness, his uniqueness \u2013 have come to represent certain values. By remixing existing images or creating new ones, Nasa Mohawk Guy provides an alternative medium for discussing societal issues, such as the importance of scientific research in American culture, or that an attractive scientist has gotten more media hype than the mission he was working on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394514150\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344419637916/bobbyhaircut.jpg\" alt=\"bobby\" width=\"460\" height=\"447\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Overall, an attractive, Mohawked Nasa scientist is a fun thing to talk about. However, the reason why people are talking about Ferdowsi \u2013 and the reason why people participate in memes in general \u2013 is because they allow people to comment, directly or indirectly, on their culture and their personal values. Participating in the Nasa Mohawk Guy meme can communicate many things: I celebrate nonconformity; I am a member of the Persian community; I encourage the expression of individuality in the workplace; I feel that science is important and cool.</p> <p>Media-based memes rarely last for long: they are part of a media landscape that shifts and changes at lightning speed. Bobak's star will fade, and another meme will take his place. What won't change is that whatever that meme is, it will telegraph what values we hold and who we are \u2013 both as individuals, and as a society.</p>",

  "<p>The heavy truck lay upside down like a broken toy. Beside it, a white Toyota was barely recognisable as a car \u2013 its front was crushed and the rest was a tangle of metal and wire after a head-on collision on one of Kenya's busiest highways. The bodies of the six people who died in the collision had been removed. Little remained of their lives \u2013 a packet of sugar in a shopping bag, a red shoe by the back seat.</p> <p>The accident took place last month near Machakos on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway. The day before, five people had died near the western town of Kericho when a tyre burst and their car rolled. A bad start to July, but nothing too unusual in east Africa's largest economy.</p> <p>In Machakos, police chief Richard Kerich urged drivers to be careful. News reports said the Toyota had been overtaking and was on the wrong side of the road when it slammed into the truck. \"[Drivers] should observe all the traffic rules when they are driving, and avoid speeding and driving carelessly,\" Kerich said.</p> <p>The problem, in a country with a growing middle class and ambitious plans to build more highways, is that many drivers don't. Now, tough new laws being examined by parliament could give motorists a greater incentive to drive carefully.</p> <p>Jakoyo Midiwo, an MP from western Kenya, has tabled a private member's bill to amend the traffic act and crack down on dangerous driving. The <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CE4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kenyalaw.org%2Fklr%2Ffileadmin%2Fpdfdownloads%2Fbills%2F2012%2FTrafficAmendmentBill2012.doc&amp;ei=01z8T5nCLIS-8AOc6v2-Bw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG0l3vlPlByUlaCF-yAYi9OPWD_Fw\" title=\"\">traffic (amendment) bill 2012</a> (doc) proposes life sentences for motorists who cause death by dangerous driving. It also calls for a jail term of up to 10 years, or a fine of up to 1m shillings (\u00a37,600), or both, for anyone found drink-driving.</p> <p>Drivers found speeding could be jailed for three months, pay a 20,000 shilling fine, or both. Drivers who overlap on pavements, or go through petrol stations to avoid traffic jams, could face three months in jail, a fine of 30,000 shillings, or both. The bill has been debated in parliament, but Midiwo says he is talking to the transport ministry about the possibility of merging the provisions of a similar bill recently approved by the coalition government.</p> <p>There is some debate about Midiwo's proposals, particularly his idea to do away with the police traffic department and train all officers to handle accidents.</p> <p>Elijah Muli, disaster preparedness manager for the <a href=\"http://www.kenyaredcross.org/\" title=\"\">Kenya Red Cross Society</a>, says the proposed amendments are in the right direction, but that it is almost as important to change the mindsets of Kenyan drivers. Road accidents claim between 3,000 and 15,000 lives every year in Kenya. With an estimated 34.4 deaths for every 100,000 people, Kenya's traffic mortality rate is the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/11/most-dangerous-roads#data\" title=\"\">16th highest in the world</a>.</p> <p>The causes include speeding; drinking and driving; poor signs; tired truck drivers; poorly trained drivers of public minibuses, known as <em>matatus</em>; a lack of public awareness, resulting in pedestrians darting across multi-lane highways; people crossing roads while talking on mobile phones; and badly maintained vehicles.</p> <p>Enforcement of the existing laws is a problem. Kenyan traffic police are notorious for taking bribes for minor offences rather than cracking down on drivers who brazenly flout traffic regulations.</p> <p>President Mwai Kibaki, who was injured in a car accident while travelling back to Nairobi from Machakos before the 2002 election, promised tougher traffic regulations during an address to the nation on 1 June. \"I am very concerned about the rampant use of mobile phones by drivers \u2026 We must also deal firmly with persons who drive under the influence of alcohol,\" Kibaki said. \"I urge traffic police officers to clamp down on these dangerous habits.\"</p> <p>Kibaki noted, however, that traffic police could not be at every junction and said Kenyans must develop a sense of personal responsibility.</p> <p>At the end of June, Midiwo's bill moved to the committee stage, where MPs will debate the amendments and approve or reject them. The bill's sponsor said he would seek input from other interested parties before presenting the bill to parliament for a third reading. \"My purpose was to ignite debate about the safety on our roads and the number of Kenyans dying \u2026 which is something we cannot ignore,\" he said.</p> <p>About 20,000 people are seriously injured in road accidents each year in a country where many people simply can't afford long-term medical treatment. According to the ministry of medical services, 65% of spinal injuries are due to road accidents.</p> <p>Muli says an entire culture needs to change. \"That's why some of the strategies that we are putting in place include social mobilisation, issues of social advocacy and media involvement,\" he said. \"It's about a culture that needs to be guided.\"</p> <p>Members of Kenya's social media networks seem to have embraced the need for change. Kenyans are tweeting about accidents they witness, advising caution, and outing drivers who drive dangerously, using the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23TwitterBigStick\">TwitterBigStick</a> hashtag.</p> <p>The Red Cross, which responds to 75% of road accidents, has more than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KenyaRedCross\">30,000 followers on Twitter</a>. Every day, it posts traffic alerts, warnings and advice while \"iVolunteers\" post witness accounts. \"We have seen an increased interest and participation of the public on Twitter,\" said Muli. \"Nowadays, a lot of information is coming through Twitter and Facebook. This has improved the information flow.\"</p> <p>The day after the Machakos accident, the Red Cross posted a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kenya-Red-Cross-Society/104561442936505\" title=\"\">sober message on its Facebook page</a>: \"It is better to lose one minute in life than to lose life in a minute. Drive responsibly. Speed kills.\"</p> <p>But a few hours later, there was news of another horrific accident near Mombasa, again on the highway to Nairobi. This time the Red Cross tweeted that all 14 passengers were feared dead.</p>",
  "<p>It is always sad when a great Olympic career drifts to a close without a fitting last hurrah. Tim Brabants remains the best canoeist his country has ever produced but battling the tide of time at the age of 35 proved impossible on a damp morning at Dorney Lake as the defending champion finished eighth and slowest in the final of the 1,000m kayak.</p> <p>Even Brabants conceded he had \"not particularly enjoyed the race\", having failed to add to the three previous medals he has won in a distinguished career, dating back to the Sydney Games in 2000. He is now due to return to his day job as a doctor specialising in accident and emergency care and admitted it was \"unrealistic\" to expect him to feature in Rio in 2016.</p> <p>He also chose to depart with a veiled dig at those who cheat their way on to medal podiums through the use of performance-enhancing drugs, an issue close to his heart. Back in 2000, when Brabants won a bronze medal, the Bulgarian silver medallist was named in several newspapers in his homeland as having failed a doping test prior to the Games. The Bulgarian authorities, however, denied the allegations and the medal positions stood.</p> <p>Brabants has also been an outspoken critic of the decision to overturn the British Olympic Association's policy of lifetime bans for drug offenders. It remains among his biggest frustrations that his sport has been tainted in the past and that cheats are lurking out there in other Games disciplines. \"There always are, unfortunately,\" he said. \"Time will tell but there are guys I've raced over the last 12 years who have disappeared on a ban for two years and come back to race you again. You can't look at someone and just tell.\"</p> <p>He is entirely confident, however, that all the medallists in 2012 are fine ambassadors for kayaking. \"They're worthy champions. I know they're good athletes and I know they're clean athletes as well. That's a key thing for me; getting the top guys on the podium knowing they're clean. All we can do as British athletes is promote drug-free sport.\"</p> <p>Having qualified slowest for the final, Brabants must have suspected he was always going to struggle to overturn the odds from lane one against such a quality field. Norway's Eirik Larsen ultimately won the gold medal, with Adam van Koeverden of Canada taking silver and Max Hoff of Germany picking up bronze. \"It was a tough race,\" admitted Brabants. \"The other athletes are exceptional ... I've beaten them in the past but didn't quite have what I needed on the day.</p> <p>\"The right guys won today and showed their class. My biggest problem was letting the crowd down. I really wanted to add to the medal tally for Team GB like the other returning medallists from Beijing have done. I thought I could be Olympic champion again, so sorry for all those who came out to support me if they're disappointed.\"</p> <p>The competitor in him, even so, still smoulders. \"I don't want to give up just yet. You can't go out with an eighth place in the Olympics. In a few weeks' time we'll re-assess where we are and see what we want to do. I love the sport, I love racing and I love being in this environment. I certainly don't want to stop this year but another four years is a tough one. I'm an ageing athlete and life moves on. I'll be 39 for Rio which is unlikely and unrealistic.\"</p> <p>British prospects of flatwater canoeing success at these Games, however, are not yet up a creek without a paddle. The 200m sprint specialist Ed McKeever is fancied to do well later this week and Brabants suspects his team-mate's medal quest will be worth following. \"I'm really looking forward to watching our 200m boys racing ... they're all looking strong. I think they're going to do really well; maybe they'll pick up where I missed out.\"</p> <p>The women's K4 kayak team of Jessica Walker, Rachel Cawthorn, Angela Hannah and Louisa Sawers enjoyed another creditable day, finishing fourth in their final. Hungary enjoyed the best day overall, although Canada's silver medallist Van Koeverden insists sprint kayaking is not totally about skill. \"If you think you're better than someone else because you beat them by 0.6 seconds, you're not, you're just luckier,\" he said, somewhat bitterly. Try telling that to Sir Chris Hoy or Usain Bolt, among others.</p>",
  "<p>North Korea has attacked an Australian newspaper for \"bullying\" after it called the country \"Naughty Korea\" in an Olympics medal table.</p> <p>The Melbourne commuter daily mX also described South Korea as \"Nice Korea\" last week, prompting Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency to accuse it of \"sordid behaviour\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.kcna.kp/goHome.do?lang=eng\" title=\"\">agency's statement</a> read: \"This is a bullying act little short of insulting the Olympic spirit of solidarity, friendship and progress and politicising sports.</p> <p>\"Media are obliged to lead the public in today's highly-civilised world where [the] mental and cultural level of mankind is being displayed at the highest level.</p> <p>\"The paper behaved so foolish [sic] as to use the London Olympics, that has caught the world interest, for degrading itself \u2026 Editors were so incompetent as to tarnish the reputation of the paper.\"</p> <p>The statement said the \"pitiful\" paper, which it incorrectly called the \"Brisbane Metro\", had \"cooked up a way of moneymaking, challenging the authority of the dignified sovereign state\", and concluded: \"It will remain as a symbol of rogue paper, to be cursed long in Olympic history.\"</p> <p>In response, mX \u2013 which ran a story on the agency's attack under the headline \"Pyongyang goes ballistic over mX tally\" \u2013 said the table was not intended to be offensive.</p> <p>\"North Korea's political leadership is no stranger to global critcism and it would be difficult for anyone to fail to see the comment was aimed directly at that record.</p> <p>\"The two teams were sitting in fourth and fifth spot respectively on the medal ladder and we thought it would be a humorous but harmless way of differentiating between the two.\"</p>",

  "<p>A business is bussing in inmates from an open prison 21 miles away and paying them only \u00a33 a day to work in its call centre.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed that dozens of prisoners from Prescoed prison in Monmouthshire, south Wales, had done \"work experience\" for at least two months at a rate of 40p an hour in the private company's telephone sales division in Cardiff.</p> <p>People working in the prisons sector described the scheme as \"disgusting\" and a \"worrying development\".</p> <p>After establishing an arrangement with minimum-security HMP Prescoed late last year, roofing and environmental refitting company Becoming Green has taken on 23 prisoners. Currently, 12 are being paid 6% of the minimum wage.</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian last month, that figure was 17 \u2013 15% of the company's call centre staff.</p> <p>The company confirmed that since it started using prisoners, it had fired other workers. Former employees put the number at 17 since December. However, the firm said firings were part of the \"normal call-centre environment\" and it had hired other staff in a recent expansion.</p> <p>Becoming Green said the category D prison had allowed the company to pay the prisoners just \u00a33 a day for at least 40 working days, but added that they could keep them at that pay level for much longer if they wanted.</p> <p>A company spokesman was unable to give the longest time a prisoner had been employed on token wages. The spokesman added that, under the arrangement, they were only allowed to take a maximum of 20% of their total call centre workforce from the prison.</p> <p>The MoJ confirmed that there was no centralised limit on the length of training placements, which was for prison governors to decide. The ministry said it had sought assurances from Becoming Green that prisoners were put into \"genuinely vacant\" posts.</p> <p>At the start of the year, the justice secretary, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8984942/Ken-Clarke-to-double-number-of-prisoners-working-full-time.html\" title=\"\">Kenneth Clarke, announced an expansion of mainly manufacturing work inside prisons</a>. Against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/may/04/kenneth-clarke-prisoners-work\" title=\"\">a background of disquiet from unions</a>, he has continued to stress that prisoners would not be putting other people out of work. Clarke <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/justice-secretary-ken-clarke-admits-plans-for-cheap-prison-work-could-jeopardise-jobs-7817812.html\" title=\"\">said last month</a> that such a development would be \"a very serious downside\" to the policy.</p> <p>In a response to questions from the Guardian, the MoJ said: \"HMP Prescoed works closely with the company, the probation service, local authorities and community groups to ensure that any impact on the local workforce is minimised.\"</p> <p>A young former employee of Becoming Green said that staff were told last November that prisoners, whose convictions are understood to range from murder to fraud and drugs offences, were going to start working at the company.</p> <p>\"We got a message one day saying that ... [the company] was going to start hiring prisoners.</p> <p>\"So I thought, 'Oh right, people who have been released.' And [my friend] said, 'No, no, no, people who are out on day release.' I thought, 'Can they do that?'\"</p> <p>She said that just before Christmas, about 10 members of the call centre team were fired and then a further seven were sacked. She left a number of months ago after feeling pressured into quitting.</p> <p>\"As they started bringing more and more in, they started firing people&#xa0;\u2026 They would have kept their jobs if it wasn't for the prison thing.</p> <p>\"They'd passed their probation period, they'd been there for several months. They'd maintained the level they were \u2013 that had been perfectly acceptable at that point. Then they [got] these people in for nearly free.\"</p> <p>She described the prisoners as \"quite nice people\" and said that some were very good workers, but added that the wage difference caused resentment.</p> <p>\"Everyone was pretty miffed because at the end of the day there's no way you can compete [with \u00a33 a day].\"</p> <p>A second female employee who has been on the dole for almost two months said she was also pushed out of Becoming Green despite meeting all of her performance targets.</p> <p>She declined to be named, worrying about the consequences for job hunting. \"I'm currently on jobseeker's allowance because I can't find another job because of all of this happening,\" she said.</p> <p>A former manager at Becoming Green claimed the company had been creating \"reasons to \u2026 justify dismissing people from the company so they could get more prison staff in\".</p> <p>\"The whole idea of what the company is doing is bringing in free labour for the business and relieving their employed staff of their responsibilities, because obviously it is more cost-effective for the business to have criminals working for them than paying a salary to each person.</p> <p>\"I left because I didn't like the way the company was being run,\" the former manager said. \"If people are rubbish in their jobs then get rid of them, I understand that.</p> <p>\"But if people are coming in every day, and are generating a lot of revenue \u2026 and the next thing you know is their jobs are on the line, there's no reason why these people should have been fired. I don't think it is right, just to save a few a quid. These people have bills to pay.\"</p> <p>The company has itself confirmed that staff had been dismissed since prisoners were taken on in November, but countered that this was part of the normal attrition rate in a demanding business where \"targets had to be met\".</p> <p>Nicola Vaughan, senior manager at Becoming Green, said that there had been \"performance issues\" with staff who had been fired.</p> <p>\"There have been a few people who have been dismissed for various reasons&#xa0;\u2026 but if you are trying to imply that we have replaced those people with prisoners then that is far wrong,\" Vaughan said.</p> <p>\"I think perhaps the people you have spoken to are a little little bit disgruntled&#xa0;\u2026 At the end of the day the contact centre industry has a very, very high turnover&#xa0;\u2026 it's tough.\"</p> <p>In January, Clarke <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8984942/Ken-Clarke-to-double-number-of-prisoners-working-full-time.html\" title=\"\">laid out plans to double the numbers of those working inside prisons</a> to 20,000 in less than 10 years.</p> <p>However, while <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/plan-for-cheap-prison-work-may-cost-thousands-of-jobs-7815140.html\" title=\"\">convicts working inside prison manufacturing goods</a> have been doing such work for many years, prison campaigners said that working at a \u00a33-a-day training rate for private businesses for a minimum of eight weeks outside of prison walls was a new phenomenon.</p> <p>\"This situation, I haven't heard of before,\" said Andrew Neilson, from the <a href=\"http://www.howardleague.org/\" title=\"\">Howard League for Penal Reform</a>.</p> <p>\"We do welcome these opportunities [for prisoners to work], but it should be on the same basis as anyone else in the community.\"</p> <p>\"We don't want the issue of prisoners on day-release being employed becoming one that divides people and effectively people are turned against those prisoners because they're seen to be taking people's jobs. That's not what should be happening.\"</p> <p>Chris Bath, executive director of reformed offenders' <a href=\"http://unlock.org.uk/staticpage.aspx?pid=24\" title=\"\">charity Unlock,</a> said he had never heard of such a practice where prisoners were spending so long in the private sector doing work experience on prison wages, and called the move a \"worrying development\".</p> <p>Steve Gillan, general secretary of the <a href=\"http://www.poauk.org.uk/index.php?home\" title=\"\">POA prison officers' union, </a>said that for any company to rely on cheap labour of prisoners was \"immoral and disgusting\".</p> <p>\"The association wants to see prisoners working and leading law-abiding lives, but not at the expense of other workers being sacked or laid off to facilitate it.</p> <p>\"Some employers must be rubbing their hands and the shareholders laughing all the way to the bank,\" Gillan said.</p> <p>\"The ministers must be held to account if the factual position is this company has sacked workers to employ prisoners \u2026 The general public will be outraged if this proves to be widespread, and proper scrutiny of contracts needs to be made public to ensure public confidence.\"</p> <p>The MoJ said that prisoners at the company who were being employed at above minimum wage were paying 40% of their salary into the victims' fund. Three of the prisoner employees were understood to be managers at the company.</p> <p>Speaking about the expansion of prison work from 10,000 to 20,000 prisoners over the next decade, Clarke told the BBC last month: \"It would be a very serious downside if we started replacing job opportunities for law-abiding people, and we've been conscious of that all the way through.</p> <p>\"Although we don't pay the prisoners the minimum wage, normally you can't start undercutting British businesses outside.\"</p> <p>He added that the CBI was \"totally supportive\" of the work initiatives.</p> <p>However, Clarke has not addressed the situation in open prisons, where inmates can still have months left on their sentences, but businesses can now pay them little more than a token wage for their labour.</p> <p>A Prison Service spokesman said: \"We want more prisoners to undertake challenging work, within the discipline of regular working hours, which will help them develop the skills they need to gain employment, reform, and turn away from crime.\"</p> <p>The spokesman added that prison work \"helps to reduce the chance of re-offending by setting up appropriate employment and rehabilitation work in the community\".</p> <p>In a statement, Becoming Green said: \"Corporations should have a social responsibility to help society. It feels that if they work with this attitude and behaviour it will help make a better society for all.\"</p> <p>The company added that this kind of work would \"enable [prisoners] to resettle and integrate back into society and not feel the need to re-offend. By working, prisoners can repay the victims of crime rather than be unproductive in prison and by working potentially turn their lives around.\"</p>",
  "<p>With under 100 days to go until the November election in the US, we can expect to hear a lot more about jobs and employment. Both candidates claim they will \"create jobs\" but neither will go beyond anodyne discussions of how to get the economy growing faster.. They're both devotees of the trickle down approach to employment \u2013 trying to expand production as rapidly as possible and hoping that the jobs appear.</p> <p>For those of us who care about the degradation of the planet's ecosystems, and climate especially, this brand of indiscriminate macroeconomic management is unacceptable. By failing to ask what's being produced, we remain tethered to unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. We're constructing a larger and larger hole to dig ourselves out of.</p> <p>If we decide to look in more detail at the jobs shortage, an obvious place to start is with our youth. Young people are facing much higher rates of joblessness than other age groups. The <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/youth-employment/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">International Labour Organisation reports</a> that 75 million young people are now unemployed. Rates of nearly 50% in Spain and above 30% in other troubled economies are well known, but the labour market outlook in other countries is also grim.</p> <p>In the US since 2008, the fraction of the workforce that is under age 25 has dropped by 13% while the 55 and over section has risen by 7.6%. A <a href=\"http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2012/02/09/young-underemployed-and-optimistic/\" title=\"\">recent Pew Study</a> found that among 18-24 year olds, only 54% were employed, a lower rate than at any time since the government began keeping statistics in 1948.</p> <p>For young people who only have high school degrees, rather than college educations, the situation is dire. According to <a href=\"http://www.heldrich.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/content/Left_Out_Forgotten_Work_Trends_June_2012_0.pdf\" title=\"\">a study by Rutgers University</a>, before the 2008 collapse, 37% of young high school graduates had full time work. Since then only 16% do, with 37% unemployed.</p> <p>And even among college graduates, whose official unemployment rates are in the single digits, earnings have declined substantially over the last decade (11% for men and 7.6% for women). It is not surprising to learn that last year's class suffered the highest level of stress on record, according to an annual survey of college freshmen taken over the past quarter century.</p> <p>One reason the situation is so bad in the US is that nearly all the burden of adjustment since 2008 has been to lay people off, rather than share hours, as was done in Europe. The comparison is especially stark with Germany and the Netherlands, countries that did adjust hours, and who now have lower youth unemployment than they did in 2008.</p> <p>If the US got serious about youth unemployment, employers could start hiring new graduates on 80% schedules, rather than at full-time. That would lead to many more new jobs, likely somewhere between 10% and 20% additional positions.</p> <p>By concentrating on reducing schedules for young people as they start their first full-time jobs, it's possible to get around a finding from behaviour economics that has bedeviled some kinds of work-sharing schemes: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect\" title=\"\">the endowment effect</a>.</p> <p>The endowment effect refers to the fact that people are very attached to things, money, or privileges that they already have. It's hard to take them away. But when it's a first job, the schedules and incomes that go with them are novel. Going from no paycheck to 80% of a hypothetical full-time salary isn't experienced as a deprivation. Instead it's a lucky break in a labour market that is unforgiving.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, the government of the Netherlands initiated such a policy for its own hiring, which then spread to other sectors. Obama should announce something similar, showing his rhetoric about jobs is sincere.</p> <p>It would be an innovative step that breaks through the gridlock of macroeconomic policy in the last few years.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www2.bc.edu/~schorj/\" title=\"\"><em>Juliet Schor</em></a><em> is a Boston-based university lecturer.

  "<p>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are the latest addition to the acronym-bound lexicon of higher education, and quite possibly the most significant of them all. They represent a new generation of online education, freely accessible on the internet and geared towards very large student numbers.</p> <p>Over recent months we have seen a remarkable spate of major MOOC ventures from top-ranked universities including MIT, Harvard, Princeton and Berkeley, offering free access to lectures and courses sourced from world leaders in their fields. And in July, 12 universities in the US and Europe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/jul/17/top-universities-free-online-classes\" title=\"\">announced their involvement in Coursera</a>, an internet course platform created by two Stanford University scientists.</p> <p>The phenomenon has been likened by the president of Stanford University to <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/04/30/120430fa_fact_auletta\" title=\"\">\"a digital tsunami\"</a>, threatening to sweep aside conventional university education. Whether or not the rise of MOOCs will prove to warrant such hyperbole, there is no doubt that something very important is happening in the global system, raising profound questions about the very nature and future of higher education.</p> <p>MOOCs are not entirely new. Both MIT and our own Open University have been offering open-source educational resources and short courses free online for some years, albeit mostly as 'tasters' for their mainstream provision. iTunesU, TED and Academic Earth are among non-university sources of excellent and free video lectures from eminent authorities. What is new about MOOCs is the scale, scope and pace of the ventures.</p> <p>Major new players include Coursera, Udacity edX, Minerva, Khan Institute, Straightline and the University of the People. All offer a range of high quality courses, free to access, with varying degrees of online support, assignments, assessment and even certification for those completing programmes. Each is claiming to have signed-up hundreds of thousands of students worldwide, albeit with relatively small percentages persevering to complete their courses.</p> <p>Unlike commercial online courses, such as those from the privately-owned University of Phoenix, most MOOCs have grown as not for profit spin-outs from US Ivy League universities and partner institutions across the world. They have nonetheless attracted over $100m of private venture capital investment this year already, as well as enthusiastic support from global information industry giants like Google and Pearson.</p> <p>There are clear echoes here of the dot-com revolution of the late 1990s, reflected in the diversity of interpretations from higher education sector observers. Many share the view of the Stanford president that MOOCs replicate the disruptive innovations that have reshaped the global information, media and news industries, by shifting market power from the established players to parvenu start-ups and alternative providers.</p> <p>Others are more sceptical, observing that the current MOOCs are essentially modern versions of the external correspondence courses that have been available for 50 years or more. Apologists for the university tradition point out that MOOCs do not offer degrees or even recognised credits towards the academic awards that distinguish 'proper' university graduates. Those with memories of the dot-com boom-and-bust years question the viability of a business model based on giving away your core products and potentially also your intellectual property rights.</p> <p>The economic viability of open (read, free) online learning has yet to be established, but could be compared with other information-based internet industries. In the post-dot-com world, value and profits have come mainly from ownership of the technology platforms through which users access information and services. This gives the platform owners huge amounts of market intelligence and sales opportunities, generated by having hundreds of thousands of captive customers. That is why the global media and technology giants are queuing up to invest in this emerging market, that Global Industry Analysts Inc have estimated will be worth $100bn worldwide by 2015. And this is where the fiercest market battles are likely to be fought.</p> <p>At this early stage of the MOOC revolution, it is premature to predict the impacts on conventional higher education providers. The universities and private venture funds investing in this area openly acknowledge the high level of experimentation and testing of waters involved. The current MOOC offerings are mostly digital versions of conventional pedagogies \u2013 what blogger Dan Butin has called <a href=\"http://elearnmag.acm.org/archive.cfm?aid=2263018#.T9d18sJ_9mM.twitter\" title=\"\">\"Learning 1.0 products in a Web 2.0 world\"</a>.</p> <p>This can and will change through the incorporation of the kinds of user interactivity already well-established in social media technologies. There is no inherent reason why MOOC-acquired learning cannot be accredited and recognised, especially as the market for degree-awarding powers opens up, subject perhaps to appropriate quality assurance arrangements.</p> <p>If, or perhaps we should say when, MOOCs mature in these ways, they will challenge our basic notions of higher education, just as our relationships with news, entertainment and other information have been transformed. When knowledge and educational content become free commodities, how will universities justify the value of their fees? When degree-level programmes and supporting services become available on-demand, whenever and however students wish to access them, why should courses be tied to academic timetables based on the ecclesiastical calendar? And when the elements of higher education \u2013 content, courses, support, assessments, awards \u2013 are all separately available from world-class providers, what will be the role of the university?</p> <p><em>Mike Boxall leads PA Consulting's </em><a href=\" http://www.paconsulting.com/highereducation\" title=\"\"><em>work with universities and colleges</em></a><em> \u2013 follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeboxall1\" title=\"\"><em>@MikeBoxall1</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>It is three years since 18-year-old Aaron Cook left the taekwondo star Steven L\u00f3pez flat on his back with a spectacular falling double kick in the men's -80kg final at the inaugural world tour event in Mexico City.</p> <p>Cook, then the future of the sport in this country, can hardly have imagined in the moment of his greatest triumph, with a cheque for $20,000 (\u00a313,000) in his pocket, that he would be discarded on the eve of the 2012 Olympics in his home city \u2013 and that L\u00f3pez, at 33, would be trying for his third gold medal at his fourth Olympics.</p> <p>There is no questioning L\u00f3pez's pedigree. He Mr Taekwondo, a superb athlete who has dominated the sport since it was admitted to the Olympics in 2000. Yet on that day in November 2009, as the revered American stared at the ceiling in a hushed hall in Mexico City, Cook was his deserved conqueror, a teenager from Dorset only the sport's hardcore knew much about.</p> <p>The British team performance director \u2013 then and now \u2013 Gary Hall, was moved to observe: \"We are thrilled with the result, not only because he beat an all-time great but also the manner of the victory. L\u00f3pez is one of the sport's most successful athletes of recent times and Aaron has proved once again that he is more than capable of competing on the world's biggest stage.\"</p> <p>Three years on and, for reasons that make sense only to British taekwondo's selectors, Cook is apparently no longer capable of competing on the world's biggest stage, despite being ranked No1 in the world, and will be watching the Olympics as a spectator rather than a competitor capable of beating the ageing L\u00f3pez.</p> <p>After much agonising, the selectors picked Lutalo Muhammad, a fine fighter in his own right, the European champion, ranked seven in the world with a win and a loss against Cook but who is now burdened with the unfair weight of controversy that has attended this shambles.</p> <p>Hall has said: \"The unfortunate situation ... wasn't ideal. We all had our worries, particularly the selectors who had to go through a very tough time. Quite a lot of pressure was applied, some of it undue. The coaching team and the performance staff behind them have done an absolutely fantastic job.\" You can only hope for their sake that they have, because, if not, they will come in for the most awful flack.</p> <p>So, what of L\u00f3pez? Is he as great as people say, as great as he was when Cook knocked him out in Mexico? He does not lack confidence or pride. The son of Nicaraguan refugees whose entire family, based in Houston, Texas, are immersed in taekwondo, L\u00f3pez is a 100%, flag-waving American. On a recent trip to see relatives in Nicaragua, he declined a meeting with the president, the Sandinista hero, Daniel Ortega, and, when we spoke, could not even remember his name.</p> <p>\"I'm sure I'm biased but I believe we're the best country in the world,\" he said. \"I know each athlete will go out there to do their best to bring home the gold medal.\"</p> <p>L\u00f3pez was a prodigy who fulfilled all the promise. \"I made the national team when I was 15 years old and [his brother] Jean, who's five years older, was on the team with me. Imagine a little 15-year-old travelling all over the world with guys who are in their 20s and you're a little kid?\"</p> <p>But this part of the journey may be a highlight for L\u00f3pez. \"In Beijing it was very difficult to get around. I've travelled all around the world, but I'd never been to England until last year, for the Olympic test event. The history of the country \u2013 Big Ben, London Bridge, Buckingham Palace \u2013 I really enjoyed the cultural part of it. It's like New York City. I felt that energy.\" Speaking before Cook missed selection, L\u00f3pez provided useful insight into the changing face of taekwondo. \"It's truly a global sport. At one time, it was only Korea taking all the medals, but at the 2010 world championships every single weight class had a world champion from different countries. Like Croatia, Mali, Azerbaijan, Turkey \u2013 they're all winning world championship and Olympic medals. It's a very competitive field. I haven't even mentioned Iran, they just won the Olympic qualifiers.\"</p> <p>\"You have the kid from Great Britain who's up and coming [Cook]. He's going to be real tough to beat because he'll have his whole country behind him.\" Sadly, no. Whatever the skill of the athlete, there is no accounting for the politics.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez will know what Cook feels like. At the Beijing Olympics, he was denied a chance at gold when docked a point on a marginal call against the Italian Mauro Sarmiento. It was his first defeat in six years and the fallout was dramatic. The American's team leader, Herb Perez, alleged that the World Taekwondo Federation (probably the most unfortunate acronym in sport) had pressured member nations not to protest at the Olympics in order to protect the image of the sport.</p> <p>\"When [poor judging] happens to you,\" Perez said, \"you're told to shut up and not say anything because of what will happen to you, or what will happen to the sport.&#xa0;If&#xa0;this is truly what taekwondo is&#xa0;about, maybe taekwondo shouldn't be in the Olympics. Maybe they should fix&#xa0;it.\"</p> <p>But taekwondo is in the Olympics and so is L\u00f3pez. He has somehow managed to dance around the sport's serial scandals, a man apart. In the small world of taekwondo, L\u00f3pez is unchallenged as the king. It is Cook's misfortune he will not get a chance at London 2012 to take a swipe at his crown.</p>",
  "<p>In May this year, my company, Flat-Club, a London-based start-up for short-term renting using social networks, became one of the first companies in the UK to benefit from the government's <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/seedeis\" title=\"\">Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme</a> (Seis).</p> <p>Seis is part of a series of schemes developed by the government to stimulate entrepreneurship and kickstart the economy in the UK. The big idea behind the scheme is to inject cash into fledgling businesses that have the potential to be next British Facebook, Google or eBay.</p> <p>Structured with the aim of attracting investors who usually don't invest in early stage businesses, Seis offers investors a lower risk by ensuring additional returns in the form of tax benefits. Furthermore, the scheme makes seed investment projects more accessible to a larger group of investors who can provide vital expertise, experience, and industry knowledge to growing UK businesses.</p> <h2><strong>What are the benefits of Seis for a small business?</strong></h2> <p>For us at Flat-Club, being part of Seis has given us a number of benefits. First, we were able to attract both venture capital and private investors to complete our last round of funding. Today, with our funding secured, we can focus on what we do best \u2013 creating a global online marketplace that helps alumni and students of top universities find short-term accommodation by leveraging their existing networks.</p> <p>Second, Seis has helped us get in touch with investors who can provide invaluable expertise and advice to a business like ours, which is competing within a niche, but booming marketplace, also known as 'the sharing economy'.</p> <p>Finally, securing investors' back up for our business has meant that our customers can now be confident that they are interacting with a company that is here to stay and grow in the long term.</p> <h2><strong>How can you raise funding with Seis? </strong></h2> <p>Fundraising is not an easy task, but with the right focus, networks and approach it's well worth the effort and time. Here are the steps we took that helped us raise the funding we needed.</p> <p><strong>Start the right business.</strong> Although trivial, a vital element to have when looking for funding is an attractive business with three key parameters: an excellent team, a good idea with a clear marketing plan, and an outstanding track record \u2013 both in terms of your personal experience and the company results.</p> <p><strong>Solve a real problem.</strong> In our case, Flat-Club provides a solution to a real problem that our customers have. Finding short-term accommodation is expensive, insecure, and time consuming. By developing a platform to leverage the existing professional and business school networks that our customers have, we were able to help them trade with people they find trustworthy, save on average 80% of hotel prices, and be able to enjoy short-term renting with 100% guarantee of no frauds and scams.</p> <p><strong>Know the details.</strong> There is still much uncertainty about Seis and many potential investors are not aware of it, so it is important to be prepared and proactive. To better understand Seis and its requirements <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/seedeis\" title=\"\">visit the website</a>.</p> <p><strong>Reach out.</strong> In its essence, looking for funding is like networking. In my quest, I personally pitched more than 100 times to 150 potential investors. The more I reached out, the better I became at pitching Flat-Club and understanding our key differentiators as a business. Clearly, I also had more chances of finding the right investors.</p> <p><strong>Build relationships.</strong> Investors invest in people, not just ideas. It is more important to demonstrate that you can execute than anything else. Flat-Club fundraising took seven months, but after one month we had already met most of our current investors. The rest of the meetings we had with the investors were held with the purpose of demonstrating that we could execute our plan.</p> <h2><strong>What's next?</strong></h2> <p>Building on our recent funding and business growth we are focused on replicating the Flat-Club model to universities and professional networks globally. And, with the right funding, tools and focus, I don't see why this wouldn't be achievable for any other growing UK-based business.<br><em><br>Nitzan Yudan is co-founder and chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.flat-club.com/\" title=\"\">Flat-Club</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Previous one-day protest strikes against the way redundancies were being implemented were a step too far for MMP's owners, so they locked the workers out, eventually closing the factory for good. </p> <p>Brutal moves like this by the employers are going to increase as their economic crisis, rooted in the global contraction of capitalist production and trade, deepens. They are forced to attack workers to gain a competitive edge in their sharpening battle against each other \u2013 nationally and internationally \u2013 in the hope of boosting falling profit rates. </p> <p>This picture will not be altered either by the outcome of November's election in Manchester Central or the next general election.</p> <p>The MMP workers though, instead of walking away, fought back. For three months they mounted a 24 hour picket at the factory gate. </p> <p>I joined them on the picket line several times along with other workers from Manchester to bring solidarity. They told a familiar story:</p> <blockquote> <p>We thought our jobs were safe, we've worked here for twenty or more years and suddenly- no future.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>This instability, faced by millions, I know well as a factory worker employed by an agency who can sack me and my fellow workers at a moment's notice. </p> <p>What we found on meeting the MMP workers was important: their heads were not hung low. On the contrary their spirits were high. As they started to fight and organise to win support, they found a greater unity and strength amongst themselves and made allies they had never expected. </p> <p>On 18 August I'll travel with family members of Manchester man Anthony Grainger to join a march in Birmingham organised by families of victims of police brutality.

They too faced the choice to accept it or fight. In campaigning they have learned some of the realities of which class interests the police and courts serve. And, like many others who refuse to bend and choose to take a stand, they are learning not what they can't do, but what, together, they c<strong>an do.</strong></p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_League_(UK,_1988)\">Communist League</a> election campaign is about standing with workers like these who are resisting attacks from the bosses and their government. Why? Because the power of working people to organise and to fight counts more than an election result.<br> How for example in the 1960s were black rights won in the United States? Wasn't it through the mass actions of millions of working people, not the benevolence of the Kennedys. Or here in the UK, wasn't the winning of health care provision after World War Two a concession in the face of rising unrest by workers wanting a better life, as the future Lord Hailsham warned in 1943:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you do not give the people social reform, they are going to give you social revolution. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>The Communist League election campaign will be about this, meeting with workers considering how to resist attacks from the bosses and their government. Through struggle we can win some concessions, but the rule of capital means that what we gain is constantly threatened. And so we'll be discussing how workers must forge a revolutionary movement that can take political power out of their hands. We'll discuss how workers acting together, along that road, have the power to deal a blow to the competition for jobs that sets us against each other, if we fight for a government-funded public works programme to provide work for millions. Not some cheap-labour scheme, but paid at union agreed rates, building homes, hospitals, and other social needs. </p> <p>We'll discuss what we can learn from Cuba's socialist revolution and the gains they fight to defend today. There, working people learned as they fought together how to begin to organise society according to human solidarity. It remains a living alternative to the failed 'entitlement' state socialism of Labour. It shows how real social solidarity and gains are won through revolutionary struggle not by looking to a big government that claims to look after you.</p> <p>To get on this road, instead of looking to parties that make promises but end up protecting the rule of capital, the challenge working people face is to look to ourselves, unite, fight more effectively and chart a course toward political action. As this crisis inevitably forces more people like the MMP workers and Grainger family to fight, so we're sure more workers will see the need to break politically from all the parties that defend the rule of capital and organise our own party and political programme that fights for our interests. The Communist League election campaign in Manchester Central will be about a small step in that direction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394401545\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344418161320/clifford_2.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Clifford campaign\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Peter Clifford </strong>is the Communist League candidate for the Manchester Central by-election on 15 November</em></p> <p><em>The Guardian Northerner is keen to run posts from all candidates in the by-election, and other contributions are very welcome.

  "<p>The Sinai has long been an area beyond the writ of Cairo. The vast desert peninsula is inhabited largely by Bedouin tribes, who for decades have been marginalised, neglected and impoverished.</p> <p>But in the 18 months since the Egyptian revolution forced out the former president Hosni Mubarak, the Sinai has become more chaotic and violent. And Israel has become increasingly alarmed by deteriorating security across its southern border.</p> <p>The peninsula is a wild frontier, a \"new hotspot with an expanding terrorist infrastructure\", according to a report, <a href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/sinai-a-new-front\" title=\"\">Sinai: A New Front</a>, by Israeli analyst Ehud Yaari for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, released earlier this year. \"Measures are needed to prevent the total collapse of security in and around the peninsula [and] avoid the rise of an armed runaway Bedouin statelet.\"</p> <p>Israel has urged the Egyptian government to take firm action against Bedouin militants and smugglers, and has enlisted the support of the US in its efforts. During a visit to Cairo last month, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, warned that Sinai could become an \"operational base\" for jihadists if security was not stepped up.</p> <p>The region has suffered from chronic under-investment in education, health and transport. Its inhabitants are among the poorest in Egypt. Added to the potent mix of poverty, alienation and tribal loyalties is a sizeable Palestinian population in the north of the peninsula, with family, political and economic connections to Gaza.</p> <p>In the south, massive investment since the 1990s in upscale resorts in the former Bedouin fishing village of Sharm el-Sheikh, and a programme to create a \"Red Sea Riviera\" along the coast, has further alienated the Bedouin. They are routinely excluded from employment in swanky resorts, and consequent resentment may have contributed to a spate of tourist kidnappings and armed robberies in the past year.</p> <p>In the north, there is markedly more violence. A pipeline supplying gas to Israel has been blown up more than a dozen times, disrupting flow and causing millions of dollars worth of damage. Armed gangs are trafficking huge numbers of people fleeing persecution, war or poverty in other parts of Africa, charging thousands of dollars for passage across the Sinai into Israel. Camps have been established, from which emanate horrific stories of rape, torture, extortion, misery and desperation. The smuggling of drugs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/eritrean-regime-arms-human-trafficking?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">and arms</a> is also a major industry.</p> <p>And there has been an increase in militant Islamism. Israel says it detects the presence of \"global jihad\" militants and groups, some loosely connected to al-Qaida. \"There is a problem with Bedouin tribes drifting towards a fundamentalist Islamic ideology, making themselves part of the Islamic jihad movement, by which I mean a loose network of small terror organisations trying to fight the current order,\" Major General Dan Harel, former deputy chief of staff of the Israel Defence Forces, said earlier this week.</p> <p>Israel cannot risk jeopardising its 33-year-old peace treaty with Egypt by taking action itself. Under the terms of the treaty, the Sinai is a demilitarised zone. But the overnight military attack by the Egyptian military may be the first step in Cairo's efforts to regain control and impose order.</p>",
  "<p>Shares in Standard Chartered have bounced back by 6% this morning as the bank fighting accusations of money laundering recovered slightly from one of its worst ever one-day falls.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/07/standard-chartered-iran-justice-department\" title=\"\">group's shares plunged by 16% on Tuesday</a> - to follow a 6% drop in the last few minutes of trading Monday - on the news that New York's State Department of Financial Services had accused the bank of laundering as much as $250bn (\u00a3161bn) for US-sanctioned Iran. The regulator also threatened to revoke Standard Chartered's banking licence.</p> <p>However, Standard Chartered <a href=\"http://www.standardchartered.com/en/news-and-media/news/global/2012-08-06-response-to-NY-State-Department-comments.html\" title=\"\">strenuously denied the allegations</a>, arguing that it had already been conducting a review of its operations and had voluntarily contacted US regulators to share its findings. It also said that transactions that may have breached US rules only equated to a fraction of the $250bn outlined by the DFS.</p> <p>Standard Chartered said: \"The group does not believe the order issued by the DFS presents a full and accurate picture of the facts. The analysis, that the group shared with all the US agencies, demonstrates that throughout the period the group acted to comply, and overwhelmingly did comply, with US sanctions and the regulations relating to U-turn payments [that allow US banks to process payments involving Iran that begin and end with a non-Iranian foreign bank]. As we have disclosed to the authorities, well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations. The total value of transactions which did not follow the U-turn was under $14m\".</p> <p>The robust defence seems to be offering some support for the shares with them gaining 72p to \u00a313.97 in early trading this morning.</p> <p>That performance came against slight falls in the wider market with the FTSE 100 off 16 points - or 0.28% - at 5825.09.</p>",

  "<p>Of the many things we thought we had to do to rebuild our business after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2011/aug/09/london-riots-croydon-reeves-video\" title=\"\">last year's riots razed to the ground</a> our historic furniture store in Croydon, being involved with young people was not one of them.</p> <p>After the initial shock of dealing with the business recovery, insurance demands, media attention and indeed the overwhelming passion and support from all over the world, it became obvious that there were many young people who were really upset they were being tarred with the same brush as the rioters. Likewise, there were many community leaders who wanted to redouble efforts to bring those inclined to the dark side out of the violent and criminal mindset that was indicative of many rioters.</p> <p>Maurice, my dad, met a few of the rioters while making the programme <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018cst8\" title=\"\">Up in Flames: Mr Reeves and the Riots</a> for the BBC. His overwhelming impression was one of people with no standards, no comprehension of right and wrong, no role models (well, not in the good sense) and no consideration for anyone but themselves. At the same time Tony Harrison, the man who introduced him to these people, was so determined to turn these people round that we were convinced the next generations can't be allowed to grow up like this.</p> <p>So, when Vinspired contacted us to talk about their <a href=\"http://vinspired.com/dosomething/\" title=\"\">Reverse Riots campaign</a>, it fitted in with not only our own thoughts, but aligned perfectly in making something positive out of the anniversary of a terrible time in our history.</p> <p>The idea of covering our remaining building, which has been refurbished next to the site of the fire, with positive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/06/london-communities\" title=\"\">Reverse Riot messages</a> seemed too good an opportunity to miss.</p> <p>With the money donated to us by the public after the riots, we created this new furniture showroom, which will also house memorabilia about the 140-odd year history of the shop including an old, charred sign from the riots. The problem was we had been searching for a way to make its opening today an event without it being a celebration of a riot. Vinspired has given us that opportunity.</p> <p>The messages on the covering on the building, which say things such as \"I've turned my life around\" and \"I believe in me\", have been uploaded by individuals showing how they have done something. Celebrities have aligned with the campaign on their Twitter feeds.</p> <p>This is only part of how we as a business have become more community-focused post-riots. We are a small company with only 15 staff and limited resources, but the support of local people has kept our business afloat so we feel that we owe it to them to be more engaged. We joined the Citizen UK campaign <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/jun/19/havens-allow-young-people-reclaim-streets\" title=\"\">City Safe</a>, promoting retail stores as safe havens for youngsters who feel intimidated or in danger when they are on the streets.</p> <p>You would have thought it was a normal reaction for a young person to seek help if they were being chased for their mobile phone, but many said they feel they would get a negative response if they were to seek sanctuary in such a fashion. How ridiculous is that, but that's what they say they feel. It's also a campaign to help the youngsters themselves dissuade their friends from destructive and negative actions.</p> <p>I have also responded to requests from local schools to go in and talk to pupils about citizenship and the riots and how to run a business. I hadn't been in a school since 1997, for my daughter's last parents' evening. Faced with two classes of 15- to 17-year-olds three months after the riots was definitely not a natural environment for a 56-year-old furniture shop director, but it was a start.</p>",
  "<p>When I say I am becoming a teacher, this can elicit any number of different responses. Surprise, approval, pity - they have all been supplied in abundance.</p> <p>People come to teaching for all sorts of reasons but I'm afraid mine are quite simple \u2013 I like talking about science, and I like talking to people. So when I went to do work experience in a local school, I fell completely in love. Despite being a handful, the students bowled me over with their charm, intelligence and creativity. Where else can you listen to the debate between two 18th-century scientists performed entirely in rap?</p> <p>I have arrived at my PGCE with 17 years of the British education system behind me. Which is quite a lot really. How many other jobs would you start with such a wealth of different experience before you have even stepped inside the door?</p> <p>I have seen a wide range of teachers and can recognise that they have all developed my understanding of the world in different ways. They all had different focuses and perceptions of what a teacher should be, and hopefully in the next year I can use this to figure out what I feel is most important. And most importantly, what I want my students to learn from me. Apart from the difference between an acid and a base, that is.</p> <p>Despite all those 17 years, I have no idea what to expect. I have got as far to expect it to be very hard work and unlike any other studying I have done before. I also expect it to be emotionally draining, physically exhausting and to lose my voice several times in my first year. But that's all part of the fun right?</p> <p>Like any other prospective trainee teacher, I am also full of fears. The biggest question I keep asking myself is will I be able to control my classes? Remembering what my class was like at school does not help. Teacher pupil relations hit rock bottom when the D&amp;T teacher got locked in the cupboard. Or maybe it was when the French teacher fled the classroom in tears after we decided that flinging paper around was more interesting than the past imperfect.</p> <p>I'm not desperate to be liked \u2013 but it would be nice to have the ability to interact with my students at a reasonable decibel, with everyone's dignity and hairstyles still intact.</p> <p>And then there are the other worries. What shall I wear on my first day? Should I get my hair cut? Will I get on with the people on my course? Though I am sure these will pale into insignificance when I have an essay, three lesson plans and a stack of marking to get through.</p> <p>I am looking forward to a new pace of life. To getting into the bustling, energetic and draining environment that are secondary schools. I can't wait to start learning about educational theory and pedagogy.</p> <p>I am passionate about making science more accessible and interesting to students. If I could influence just one student to take chemistry at university level, or even just at sixth form, I would be very, very happy. High aspirations for someone who has not even started her first school placement, I know.</p> <p>So for now I will stick to worrying about whether I have enough folders and Post It notes for the year ahead.</p> <p><em>Sarah Maloney graduated in chemistry and will start a PGCE at the University of Huddersfield next month.<br></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

Against the background of fragile global recovery and the intensification of the eurozone crisis, Germany has recorded strong GDP growth and a declining trend in unemployment, partly as a result of previous structural reforms.<br> Several factors contribute to Germany's solid macroeconomic position. Germany is the only major advanced economy which had lower unemployment rate in H112 than it had in 2007. The level of German GDP has increased by a cumulative 5.8% since the beginning of 2010, compared to 2.3% for the eurozone. The monetary conditions set for the entire eurozone by the ECB are accommodative for Germany given the strong cyclical position of its economy. As a consequence of safe-haven capital inflows, yields are also at extremely low levels. Furthermore, Germany has a strong net external creditor position and a large, albeit gradually declining, current account surplus.</p> <p>The German financial sector has stabilised since 2009 and liquidity is abundant in the current environment. However, meeting Basel III requirements will remain a challenge for German banks in light of modest profitability and still a high leverage. Since mid-2008, German banks have cut their total eurozone exposure by \u20ac332bn, a 30% fall, of which \u20ac187bn was withdrawn from Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, a fall of 44%. Despite this fast pace of deleveraging, the quality of the remaining assets may well deteriorate further as the recession deepens in the periphery.<br> Germany has all the ingredients of a declining public debt path. The economy is growing, budget deficit is moderate and nominal interest rates reached record low levels. Nevertheless the longer track record serves as a warning sign. Despite the fiscal rules of the eurozone, the debt/GDP ratio had increased to 83% by 2010 from 55% in 1995. During the 13 years of monetary union, the German debt ratio declined in only five years and has been above the 60% reference value since 2003.</p> <p>Following the pledge of \u20ac100bn to recapitalise the Spanish banking sector, Fitch considers the likelihood of disbursing all of the EFSF's \u20ac440bn lending capacity to have risen significantly. Given Germany's maximum guarantee of EUR211bn, this would translate into a 7pp increase in the gross debt/GDP ratio.</p> <p>Germany remains exposed to the systemic component of the crisis. A significantly deeper recession of its large eurozone trading partners could also push Germany into recession with negative repercussions for the fiscal stance as well. Furthermore, additional sizeable contribution to eurozone bail-out funds, on top of the EFSF guarantees, could push German debt level above 90% of GDP, close to the upper limit Fitch generally considers consistent with a 'AAA' rating. Materialisation of these risks would put downward pressure on the rating.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T14:58:06.968Z\">at 3.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50226890b57975a08080f33c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T13:24:32.512Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe349803-4eae-427f-8b1c-9a14afcd0dff\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344432499877/34b8c9e8-8482-4c86-806b-84a69285a5e0-460.jpeg\" alt=\"The McDonald's Restaurant USA Number One Store Museum is seen in Des Plaines, Illinois \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The McDonald's Restaurant USA Number One Store Museum.

  "<p>The US justice department is looking into allegations that Standard Chartered illegally moved $250bn of Iranian money around the global financial system, according to a source close to the investigation.</p> <p>More than \u00a38bn ($12.5bn) has wiped off the stock market value of the banking group since Monday, when a New York regulator issued a damning report alleging the bank had flouted US laws in its dealings with Iran. The bank's shares lost another 16% of their value Tuesday.</p> <p>A source with direct knowledge of the investigation said the report was now being considered by the justice department, which could pursue a criminal case against the bank and its executives. The justice department works in conjunction with the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which monitors and enforces US trade sanctions against countries including Iran.</p> <p>In its report the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) said it had evidence of similar breaches by the bank in Libya, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and Sudan, all countries under US sanctions. Both the justice department and NYSDFS declined to comment on the next stage of the investigation.</p> <p>The bank has denied wrongdoing and said the regulator had not provided \"a full and accurate picture of the facts\". The bank said \"99.9%\" of the disputed Iranian transactions had complied with US law.</p> <p>In May Standard Chartered announced it was ending its business in Iran after decades of international pressure. </p> <p>John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University in New York, said even a single illegal transaction would be enough to spark a justice department investigation. \"There are 20-year sentences for money laundering in the US,\" he said.</p> <p>The move is another blow for the UK's financial services industry, which has been rounded on in Washington following Barclays' alleged fixing of Libor interest rates, JP Morgan's huge London losses and a devastating US government report that concluded HSBC had acted as banker to criminals and terrorists around the world.</p> <p>The report is also damaging to the bank's top management, who only last week boasted the bank was too \"boring\" to be afflicted by the scandals sweeping the UK financial services industry. Peter Sands, Standard Chartered's chief executive, was recently tipped as a potential governor of the Bank of England and finance chief Richard Meddings had been linked to the top job at Barclays vacated by Bob Diamond, forced out following the Libor scandal.</p> <p>Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said: \"Standard Chartered's head is on the chopping block.\" He said Iran was an oil-rich country that no international bank would chose to ignore. \"But the US and Iran have been at each others throats for 40 years. You have to make a choice,\" he said.</p> <p>Henning said the dramatic share sell-off may yet prove overblown. \"In the end this may not be HSBC but the question remains about how many heads will roll and how high up. Diamond has set the benchmark pretty high,\" he said.</p> <p>James Cox, law professor at Duke University, said: \"Frankly it looks like the bank turned more than a blind eye in its quest for profits. Once again we see a bank putting personal gain ahead of public interest.\"</p> <p>In the UK the Financial Services Authority is keeping a close watch on the situation, as it always does when share prices move so violently.</p> <p>Sands and Meddings have been forced to cut short their holidays and return to London to deal with the crisis. Meddings and Sands both joined Standard Chartered in 2002 \u2013 the alleged violations ran between 2001 and 2007. An emergency board meeting is expected to be called shortly.</p> <p>Only a week ago the bank reported its 10th successive year of record profits.<br>While it is not a household name in the UK, its blue and green logo is familiar site on high streets across Asia and Africa and the bank sponsors Liverpool football club. It employs 90,000 people, some 2,700 of whom are in the UK head office.</p> <p>The timing of the allegations by NYSDFS \u2013 which claimed that the bank's actions had left the US \"vulnerable to terrorists, weapon dealers, drug kings and corrupt regimes\" \u2013 has stunned the bank, which insists it is going to defend itself against the claims.</p> <p>Even as it admitted that it had moved \"under $14m\" for Iranian clients \u2013 albeit considerably less than the $250bn outlined in the regulatory order \u2013 the bank was unrepentant as it made it clear it would refute the allegations at an appearance before the regulator on 15 August.</p> <p>While it had breached so-called U-turns, which were transactions that US authorities allowed to take place as long as the money did not end up in Iranian banks, it said \"well over 99.9% of the transactions relating to Iran complied with the U-turn regulations\".</p> <p>The US regulator's 30-page report reproduces emails and conversations between Standard Chartered staff, including a remark from a London-based director when warned by a US colleague of potential problems in dealing with Iran. \"You fucking Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we're not going to deal with Iranians,\" the director said.</p> <p>The director is not named but the exchange is said to have taken place when the bank's chief executive for America warned, among others, the head group executive director for risk. At the time, October 2006, this title was held by Meddings, who was promoted to finance director the following month. The director for the US at the time was Ray Ferguson, currently running the Singapore business. The bank would not comment on individuals.</p>",

While the BBC last night chose to focus on his sudden recovery from injury, our commenters seemed to think that the doctor's note was a side issue to the fact that the scheduling made it impossible for runners to compete in both the 800m and 1500m, the classic middle-distance runners' double. This is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/08/london-2012-olympics-day-12-live-blog?commentpage=4#comment-17566635\">what I said earlier</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/07/taoufik-makhloufi-olympic-1500m-gold-disqualification\">Taoufik Makhloufi controversy</a> is a ridiculous creation. Sure it was a bit odd that he dropped out of the 800m. Sure he probably wasn't injured. But somebody messed up by entering him in both events when they are scheduled against each other and this was a way out. But the people who really ought to be embarrassed are the people who decided to schedule the 800m and the 1500m like this. Middle distance runners have a fine tradition of running in both those events. The story of Coe and Ovett wouldn't exist if they had had to choose which to run in. One would have chosen 800 and the other 1500. No drama there. Makhloufi ran a great 1500m. He should've been able to run in both but was denied a proper chance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Our Olympics correspondent Owen Gibson tells me that it was Locog that decided on the Track &amp; Field schedule. Asked if the schedule stopped athletes from doubling up, a Locog spokeswoman said: \"This is something that is looked at at each Games and is looked at with the IAAF. I'm quite confident we've been alright on that.\" </p> <p>What do you think of the Makhloufi controversy? Do you think it is still possible for athletes to do the 800-1500 double? Is that still the double athletes aim for? Is the 1500-5000 now a more likely double to shoot for?</p> <p>You can get in touch via email to <a href=\"mailto:mailto:steve.busfield@guardian.co.uk\">steve.busfield@guardian.co.uk</a> or via Twitter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Busfield\">@Busfield</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5022a674b57975a08080f37a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T17:48:36.670Z\">6.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/08/london-2012-olympics-day-12-live-blog?commentpage=last#block-5022a55395cb77f057201c55\">Pakete Perez may have a point</a> about the Spanish and their injuries.

Stuart Hayes played this role for the Brownlees yesterday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17564682\">RoyRoger asks</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst I was watching the Brownlee brothers' interview after their medal victory I got the impression that they had an unfair advantage over the rest of their competitors. Am I the only one who picked up on this? Or have I missed the point/purpose of the race? Is it a team race? Or are all entrants expected to do of their best?</p> <p>I mention the latter point because a few days previously a few competitors were sent home for not doing their best.</p> <p>Back to the interview. On the interview couch sat three triathlon competitors. Why three I wondered? The Brownlee brothers including triathlete Stuart Hayes.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17564746\">MsRobinson answers</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well the Brownlees had a pacemaker which I reckon helps in the bike ride a great deal. Support from your brother and one other is pretty helpful I guess but it went true to the formbook. So no complaints.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17564805\">conanthebarbarian adds</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hayes was there as a pacemaker. As a three their strategy was to race so at least one of them would win (a Brownlee). This is a practice common in a number of sports, most notably cycling. Bradley Wiggins was not competing to win in the road race. Four of the five in that team were working so that Mark Cavendish could have a chance at the win in the sprint finish. Presumably you now think that gold medal winner Wiggins was \"not competing in the olympic spirit\" as well. I think you are wrong. Because they were all competing for a win for their country and working to that aim. Had any of these competitors found themselves in with the chance for the win at the finish they would have taken it. That does not mean they cannot start out with a particular strategy and it is a world away from setting out to fail and not even bothering to compete.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5022349b95cb77f057201bd0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T09:42:51.983Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">5000m</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain's Mo Farah is jogging around the stadium in preparation for his heat for the 5000m, which is about to start.

They say their case revolves around one key statistic: that although small fishing boats account for 77% of the UK's fishing fleet and 65% of full-time employment in the industry, they are allowed access to only 4% of the fishing quota.</p> <p>The result of this apparent imbalance, says a new alliance of environmental activists and fishermen, is that the viability of boats under 10 metres long \u2013 and thereby classed by the EU as \"inshore\" operators \u2013 is increasingly under threat. Big fishing interests not only dominate the industry, but are also threatening fish stocks. This, they say, threatens the existence of fishing communities that go back centuries.</p> <p>In Hastings on the south coast, a fleet of 29 small fishing boats still operates from the beach known as the Stade, mainly catching cod, plaice and sole. The town's fishing industry is part of the south-east region, in which 339 small boats have access to a defined pool representing about 30% of the regional quota, while nine larger vessels control 70%.</p> <p>Local fishermen say that until 2006, they were effectively left to fish as they saw fit, but the introduction of a European register of buyers and sellers in 2006 marked the arrival of a much more stringent regime.</p> <p>Paul Joy, a local fisherman and co-chair of <a href=\"http://www.nutfa.org/\" title=\"\">Nutfa (the New Under Ten Fishermen's Association)</a>, spoke to the Guardian for a film made as part of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\" title=\"\">Anywhere But Westminster series</a>. In January, he says, he was monitored by a police helicopter while at sea, before his catch of cod was weighed and found to be slightly above his catch limit. Having already been fined \u00a37,500 for exceeding his limit, he is waiting to hear whether he will be prosecuted.</p> <p>\"If we were drug smugglers we'd understand it,\" he told the Guardian. \"But we're just fishermen trying to earn a living, and with the quotas as they are, we can't.\"</p> <p>At the height of the cod season, in early winter, each boat's catch limit has been set at about 1.4kg a day, which represents less than a half a fish. \"What we're allowed to catch doesn't even pay for the fuel to go out there and catch it,\" said Joy.</p> <p>\"We've lost five or six weeks this summer because of the weather,\" said local fisherman John Griffin, 52. \"You can't run a business like this. It'd be nice to tick over \u2013 but for the last few years, we've been on a deficit. Eventually, something's got to give.\"</p> <p>\"We've got enough car parks and amusement arcades in Hastings,\" he said. \"This fishery's been here for thousands of years and generations of people. To lose it would be crazy.\"</p> <p>This year sees a sweeping review of the EU's common fisheries policy (CFP), already the focus of campaigning by groups and individuals including Friends of the Earth, the WWF and the cook and Guardian writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.</p> <p>Now, the small fishing interests represented by Nutfa have united with Greenpeace to produce <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/reports/manifesto-fair-fisheries\">a Manifesto for Fair Fisheries</a>, published today. It advocates granting \"priority access\" to such fish as cod, hake and monkfish to small fishermen, and allocating the quota \"in a way which rewards sustainable fishing methods and protects coastal communities\".</p> <p>Campaigners say the share of the quota given to small boats should be about 20%, but acknowledge the impossibility of such a change. The UK government has proposed reallocating unused quota, amounting to about 3% of the total, to small boats but the UK Association of Fish Producer Organisations \u2013 dominated by large-scale fishing interests \u2013 has applied for a judicial review.</p> <p>The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was working with Nutfa on improving the way the quota is managed for smaller fishermen. Defra said the proposed reforms of the common fisheries policy would help small operators, because they should allow member states to take over management of their own quota, which would enable some of the interests of the smaller fleet to be prioritised.</p> <p>The European commission said it was also looking to the interests of smaller fleets, for instance by helping them gain access to more of the funds for improving vessels: the bigger a country's small fleet, the more financial assistance that member state would be allocated. A spokeswoman added: \"The commission has also proposed that fishermen should be able to trade quotas between themselves so that the quotas can be used efficiently and flexibly. In such a system, the smaller vessels could be protected by having a part of the quota set aside for them.\"</p> <p>The CFP reforms were passed by member state ministers in June, but they must pass the European parliament too, and many MEPs of various countries have links with the big, industrialised fishing industries, so there are fears that the proposals may face a mauling. The fisheries commissioner, Maria Damanaki, has urged members of the public to make their views known, as public pressure has proved key to the passage of proposals to ban the wasteful practice of throwing edible fish back into the sea, dead.</p> <p>But thanks to compromises made to get the reform accepted, a full ban on discards of cod, haddock, plaice and sole will not be in place until 2018. Some of the fishermen represented by Nutfa claim they are mystified as to what they will then be intended to do with fish that are caught beyond their quota.</p>"
