  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has urged Eurozone leaders to act swiftly in response to the debt crisis in Greece and Spain, or risk dragging down the global economy with another financial crisis.</p> <p>The IMF warned that the situation was grave and could escalate into a wider downturn unless national leaders ended their disputes with a long-lasting deal. As eurozone finance ministers met in Luxembourg for crisis talks and the launch of the euro's permanent rescue fund, the IMF urged Europe and the US to promote growth to help major developing economies like China, Brazil and India .</p> <p>The Washington-based lender said at the start of its annual meeting, in Tokyo, that the \"downside risks are judged to be more elevated than in the April 2012 or September 2011 world economic outlook reports\". The annual assessment of the global economic situation said it was not clear whether the situation was another bump in the road to recovery or a worsening of the situation. \"The answer depends on whether European and US policymakers deal proactively with their major short term economic problems,\" it said.</p> <p>The warning comes against a backdrop of slowing GDP growth across developed countries and much of the developing world as trade dries up and governments increasingly hide behind protectionist barriers. Although Britain was singled out by the IMF as one of the developed nations expected to grow next year, chancellor George Osborne was forced to concede in his speech to the Conservative party conference on Monday that lack of growth in the past two years meant austerity measures could last until as long as 2018.</p> <p>And the IMF admitted that it, like many other forecasting organisations, had underestimated the negative impact on growth of steep cuts in public spending. It said: \"Staff research suggests that fiscal cutbacks had larger than expected negative short-term multiplier effects on output, which may explain some of the output falls.\"</p> <p>The World Bank, which is holding its annual meeting alongside the IMF in Tokyo, added to the gloom with a report that warned of a cuts in growth across the developing world. Stock markets tumbled as the prospects for growth were trimmed by the bank, which mainly lends to cash-strapped poorer countries.</p> <p>The FTSE finished the day at 5845, down 26 points, while continental stock markets also fell. Figures showing German manufacturing has lost much of its vitality over the summer compounded gloomy assessments of the French economy to further depress markets. But eurozone ministers were adamant that Spain would not need a bailout and was capable of refinancing its banks and keeping within budget constraints without the need for a further EU funds.</p> <p>The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said Madrid had made clear it wanted no help. \"Spain needs no aid programme. Spain is doing everything necessary, in fiscal policy, in structural reforms,\" he said as he arrived at the launch of the European Stability Mechanism in Luxembourg, which will eventually have \u20ac500bn (\u00a3405bn) at its disposal.</p> <p>Osborne told conference that he would need to make extra cuts in welfare spending until 2018 to reduce the UK's structural deficit. He blamed the slowdown in the global economy for the difficulties faced by the UK as it seeks to increase exports and rebalance the economy towards manufacturing.</p> <p>The global economy will grow at 3.3% this year and 3.6% next year, the IMF said, down 0.2 and 0.3 points respectively from forecasts earlier this year. The UK is expected to suffer a 0.4% reduction in national income this year before recovering to 1.1% next year. Only two years ago, world output was 5.1% and the recovery from the 2008 crash seemed under way.</p> <p>Since then a fall in demand across the west has forced China to cut production. Countries dependent on the sale of commodities have experienced falling prices, further eroding their capacity to pick up the slack left by indebted developed nations.</p> <p>The IMF's first deputy managing director David Lipton blamed much of the instability and fear in the global economy on the US, which he said needs to do more to show it is trying to address the expiring tax cuts and automatic spending reductions that will hit early next year unless Congress acts. While most of the focus has been on Europe, Lipton stressed that the US fiscal problems also posed a significant threat.</p> <p>\"We would like to see the United States lower the level of uncertainty by embracing more specifically the need to avoid the fiscal cliff and deal with the medium-term problems,\" said Lipton, a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama.</p>",
  "<p>The law of libel in England and Wales is among the most limiting in the free world: in the latest <a href=\"http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Global%20and%20Regional%20Press%20Freedom%20Rankings.pdf\" title=\"\">global press freedom rankings, the UK as a whole ranks 31st</a>, along with Belize and Micronesia. The need to update the law to reflect the digital age, to limit libel tourism and to restrict damages was one of the few areas of common ground at the last election. So it's welcome news that <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120912/debtext/120912-0003.htm#column_366\" title=\"\">the coalition's defamation bill has now reached the House of Lords</a>. But it is less good news that, despite efforts by Lib Dem backbenchers and the opposition, it is a flawed piece of work that falls far short of providing the defence that serious journalism \u2013 digital and newspaper \u2013 so badly needs.</p> <p>As campaigning organisations like Index on Censorship <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/08/promises-libel-law-reform-kept\" title=\"\">argue in a letter to the Guardian today</a>, the bill as it stands would not have protected any of the journalists, scientists, doctors and activists caught up in recent cases. These are of course precisely the areas where divergent views are most valuable, but their defence is most fraught.</p> <p>The bill is certainly not all bad. It should bring better protection for scientific journals, it strengthens the defence of \"honest opinion\" and makes libel tourism harder, if not hard enough. Website archives will no longer need to fear a defamation case months or even years after original publication. And a new \"serious harm\" test should end trivial prosecutions.</p> <p>What is lacking is a sense of the scale of the challenge faced by serious journalism. This is only partly about traditional news organisations fighting to preserve investigative journalism \u2013 they are concerned by an apparent weakening of the defence of \"responsible journalism\" that, in translation to legislation, seems likely to generate a whole new series of tests. It is also about the new world of blogging and posting where discussion of legitimate concerns on a forum can be shut off by a single threatening phone call from an in-house lawyer. These are the places that might provide early warning of problems in a chain of care homes or difficulties with a government contractor. If this kind of expression is to flourish as it should as a vital arm of democratic accountability, it needs protection against the rich and powerful whose interests it may be crossing. A robust public interest defence that offers some security where matters under debate are of public concern and are the subject of honest opinion is a serious omission.</p> <p>Like any attempt to strike a balance, weighing free expression against protection of reputation is art as much as science. And that's another reason why this bill is important. Legal decisions here reverberate across the common law jurisdictions from Canada to the Caribbean. The better free expression is protected here, the better the UK can argue internationally against oppression and persecution.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2012/oct/08/neuroscience\" title=\"\">Nobel prizes are announced this week</a>, with medicine and physics leading the pack. As the week continues, more brilliant scientists will be honing their skills at modesty, incredulity and shock in the event of that all-important phone call from Sweden.</p> <p>Sorry, that is grossly unfair. Most Nobel prizewinners will have carried out their breakthrough work for many years before they are recognised with the prize, and probably long after they had given up hope of that ultimate accolade \u2013 these are not the Oscars, after all, where an actor at least knows that he or she has made it to a shortlist and on the night will be well aware of the cameras focused on the tiniest twitch in facial expression. For the rest of the scientific community around the world, this is also a time to hope that the winner comes from one's own particular area of research, boosting the chances of bathing in reflected glory and gaining valuable research funding.</p> <p>For whatever accolades are dished out, the hard graft of science continues. I'm often asked whether, now that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/higgs-boson\" title=\"\">Higgs boson</a> has been found, the scientists working at the Large Hadron Collider can pack up and go home. Far from it; these are exciting times in particle physics and there are plenty more unanswered questions that we hope to address. That famous quote by the American theoretical physicist, John Wheeler, is as true today as it has ever been: \"As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance.\"</p> <p>Science stories are in the news now more than ever with discoveries and breakthroughs seemingly coming thick and fast, from genetics to brain science to nanotechnology to astronomy. And these are just the headline-grabbing topics. Of course one can argue that scientific progress has been taking place for hundreds of years and it is just that we are so much better now at reporting it. This is true. But one thing has changed: research disciplines previously unconnected are now starting to overlap and merge, with physicists, chemists, biologists, engineers, medics, computer scientists and mathematicians pooling their expertise to attack common problems. One such exciting field that is coming of age is quantum biology \u2013 where quantum physicists like me work alongside molecular biologists to attempt to explain a number of baffling phenomena in living cells.</p> <p>Although many examples can be found in the literature dating back half a century, there is still no widespread acceptance that quantum mechanics, that baffling yet powerful theory of the subatomic world, might play an important role in biological processes. Of course, biology is, at its most basic, chemistry, and chemistry is built on the rules of quantum mechanics in the way atoms and molecules behave and fit together. But biologists have until recently been dismissive of counter-intuitive aspects of the theory and feel it to be unnecessary, preferring their traditional ball-and-stick models of the molecular structures of life. Likewise, physicists have been reluctant to venture into the messy and complex world of the living cell \u2013 why should they when they can test their theories far more cleanly in the controlled environment of the physics lab where they at least feel they have a chance of understanding what is going on.</p> <p>But now, experimental techniques in biology have become so sophisticated that the time is ripe for testing a few ideas familiar to quantum physicists. I'm not talking cats in boxes that are dead and alive at the same time, but a range of phenomena, from the way proteins fold or genes mutate to the way plants harness light in photosynthesis, how our sense of smell works, and even the way some birds seem to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. All appear to utilise some of the more bizarre features of the quantum world; and it's all very exciting.</p> <p>So if scientists are shedding their silo mentality and becoming ever more interdisciplinary, isn't it time the Nobel prizes followed suit and better reflected this trend? The committee could introduce new categories and vary them annually. There might be one year when astrobiology, material science and geophysics are picked, another year when they go to nanochemistry, artificial intelligence and quantum biology. Boundaries between the sciences are blurring. Why not just reward the best research, rather than pigeonholing disciplines? After all, it's not a new idea; physicists and biologists have worked together fruitfully in the past. Didn't <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/\" title=\"\">Crick (a physicist) and Watson</a> (a biologist) do just that?</p>",
  "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/chancellor-angela-merkel-faces-protests-during-athens-trip-a-860156.html\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel visits Athens</a> on Tuesday, she will find a Greece in its fifth consecutive year of recession. In 2008 and 2009, the recession was a spillover from the global financial crisis. Since then it has been caused and deepened by the austerity policies imposed on Greece by the troika \u2013 of the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, the European Central Bank \u2013 and the Greek government.</p> <p>These policies are devastating the Greek people, especially workers, pensioners, small businessmen and women, and of course young people. The Greek economy has contracted by more than 22%, workers and pensioners have lost 32% of their income, and unemployment has reached an unprecedented 24% with youth unemployment at 55%. Austerity policies have led to cuts in benefits, the deregulation of the labour market and the further deterioration of the limited welfare state that had survived a neoliberal onslaught.</p> <p>The government argues that only the austerity agenda can make the Greek public debt viable again. But the opposite is true. Austerity policies prevent the economy from returning to growth. Austerity creates a vicious spiral of recession and an increase in debt that in turn leads both Greece and its lenders to calamity.</p> <p>All this is known to the European and Greek policymakers and elites, including Merkel, who aim to implement similar programmes in all European countries facing debt problems, such as Spain, Portugal and Italy. Why do they insist so dogmatically on this disastrous political and economic path? We believe that their aim is not to solve the debt crisis but to create a new regulatory framework throughout Europe that is based on cheap labour, deregulation of the labour market, low public spending and tax exemptions for capital. To succeed, this strategy uses a form of political and financial blackmail that aims to convince or coerce Europeans to accept austerity packages without resistance. The politics of fear and blackmail used in Greece is the best illustration of this strategy.</p> <p>My party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/17/syriza-victory-greece-austerity-crisis\" title=\"\">Syriza-United Social Front</a>, respects the ordinary European taxpayer who is asked to shoulder loans to countries in distress, including Greece. The European citizens should know, however, that loans to Greece are paid into an \"escrow\" account and are used exclusively to repay past loans and to re-capitalise near bankrupt private banks. The money cannot be used to pay salaries and pensions, or to buy basic medicine for hospitals and milk for schools. The precondition for these loans is even more austerity, paralysing the Greek economy and increasing the possibility of default. If there is a risk of European taxpayers losing their money, it is created by austerity.</p> <p>This has to stop now. Europe needs a new plan to deepen European integration. Such a plan must challenge neoliberalism and lead European economies back to recovery. It should prioritise the needs of workers, pensioners and the unemployed, not the interests of multinational companies and bankrupt bankers. Syriza-USF has committed itself to this road. We know it is a difficult one. But it is the only plan that can restore the European vision of social justice, peace and solidarity.</p> <p>This plan will succeed only if popular struggles radically change the balance of forces. These struggles have started already and have led to the rise of left and resistance movements throughout Europe. They keep alive democracy, equality, freedom and solidarity, the most important values of the European political tradition. These values must prevail. Otherwise Europe will regress to a dark past we thought gone for ever.</p>",

  "<p>The single best description that one can make about Mitt Romney's foreign policy agenda to date is that, quite simply, it's a critique, not a policy.</p> <p>Rather than lay out a vision for American power, or even an alternative to the national security stewardship of Barack Obama, Romney has been content to simply say why he thinks the president has done a lousy job, without offering voters any sense of what he would do differently as commander-in-chief. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-speech-text\">his speech at Virginia Military Institute Monday</a> was pretty much more of the same.</p> <p>Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find a single substantive difference between what Romney is proposing as a candidate and Obama is actually doing as president. Consider, for example, Romney's discussion of Iran \u2013 an area in which he has claimed there are significant contrasts between his views and those of the president:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf the region \u2013 and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions \u2013 not just words \u2013&#xa0;that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I dare you to try and identify any difference between this policy and the policy currently being implemented by President Obama. Aside from perhaps a slightly more punitive approach to sanctions, and a more direct reference to the use of force in the last sentence, the two candidate's approaches are almost completely identical. Monday's entire speech from Romney was like this. </p> <p>\u2022 On Libya, Romney says he will \"support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them\" \u2013 this is President Obama's strategy.</p> <p>\u2022 On Egypt, Romney says, \"I will use our influence \u2013 including clear conditions on our aid \u2013 to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel\". This is President Obama's current strategy in Egypt.</p> <p>\u2022 On Afghanistan, Romney says, \"I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation\". Again, this is the same approach taken by President Obama.</p> <p>The only single area where one could possibly find even a hint of variance between the two men is on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/romney-obama-failed-leadership-middle-east\">sending arms to the opposition forces in Syria</a> who, as Romney put it, \"share our values\". Good luck in determining that; but again, this, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/world/middleeast/cia-said-to-aid-in-steering-arms-to-syrian-rebels.html?hp\">according to the New York Times</a>, is to some extent already happening.</p> <p>Romney's entire speech relies on projecting a version of Obama's foreign policy that is simply belied by reality. For example, Romney continues to claim that \"the president has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years\", even though he has signed three \u2013 with South Korea, Panama and Colombia.</p> <p>Where Romney criticizes Obama, his objections are contradicted by his own platitudes. On the one hand, he talks about the struggle between \"democracy and despotism\" in the Middle East; at the same time, he attacks the Obama administration for not keeping troops in Iraq longer \u2013 even though the departure of US troops was the explicit desire of a freely-elected, democratic Iraqi government. Apparently, Romney's support of democracy is correlated, somewhat, with his own policy preferences.</p> <p>He says that he will call on America's Nato allies to pony up more for defense spending and hitting their Nato benchmarks \u2013 a perennial call from US policy-makers that has always fallen on deaf ears in Europe. The idea that Romney, who has directly insulted the UK, Spain, France and other European nations for their social welfare policies, will extract bigger shares of Nato's defense budget from them seems far-fetched at best.</p> <p>But Romney's foreign policy delusion is not limited to Europe. While he has repeatedly insulted the Palestinian people and said they have no real interest in peace with Israel, he says that a new president \u2013 a Romney presidency \u2013 \"will bring the chance to begin anew\" in resolving the conflict. And this from a man who says Barack Obama believes \"hope\" is a strategy!</p> <p>Perhaps the most delusional element of Romney's speech, though was this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is the responsibility of our president to use America's great power to shape history \u2013 not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>To be sure, these are words that have a long history on the presidential campaign trail: paeans to American exceptionalism and influence on the world stage are nothing new. In 2008, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/16/uselections2008.barackobama\">Barack Obama spoke of his desire</a> \"to lead the world anew\". These sentiments are indicative of a larger and more troubling conceit in American foreign policy: the notion that we Americans possess the power to shape global events.</p> <p>During the cold war, arguably, the United States possessed some semblance of political suasion: the potential for planet-destroying nuclear war and the presence of a rival superpower had a way of grabbing the attention of like-minded nations. But in the post-cold war era, while the US remains a powerful global actor, we are miles away from omnipotence. To an extent greater than our politicians would like to admit, the United States is often \"at the mercy of events\"; and our ability to bend other nations and peoples to our will is surely limited.</p> <p>Even in places where the US has directly intervened, like Iraq and Afghanistan, our influence over nominal allies has been remarkably constrained. In places where we provide significant financial assistance: Pakistan, Israel and, again, Afghanistan, each of these nation's leaders do largely as they please, not as the United States demands. Minor considerations like reality did not, however, prevent Romney implicitly criticizing Obama's policy in the Middle East \u2013 and arguing that a better course exists:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But no serious observer of the region believes that any of these policies would have any significant impact on the process of political transformation taking place in the Middle East. And Romney is silent about why, even in places where our engagement is the greatest, our influence appears to have such a minimal impact.</p> <p>In Mitt Romney's worldview \u2013 in so much as one can detect one \u2013 the key to American power lies in some amorphous notion of US leadership disconnected from the extraordinary challenges of actually conducting foreign policy. Talking about leadership and resolve is easy \u2013 doing it is the hard part.</p> <p>This explains, more than any other reason, why Romney's policy prescriptions are so vague and meaningless. It's the yawning chasm between what American power can actually achieve and what a politician seeking to be president says it ought to be doing.</p> <p>In the end, Romney doesn't have much of a coherent policy agenda and his critique is wildly off-base. His real problem, though, is that he barely seems to grasp how the world \u2013 and, in turn, American power \u2013 actually works.</p>",
  "<p>A world where Mitt Romney holds the single most powerful office may sound a very different place from that of Barack Obama. In many ways, however, it is likely to look uncannily familiar.</p> <p>On one global issue after another, the Republican candidate has lambasted his opponent for his alleged failure to stand up for US interests and values abroad \u2013 a traditional theme of Republican attacks on Democrats. But to the extent Romney has put forward concrete proposals, most have been all but indistinguishable from the status quo, according to both liberal and conservative analysts as well as diplomats in Washington.</p> <p>The main caveat concerns a future president Romney's response to a crisis, where instincts may prove more important than long-held plans. George Bush came to office in January 2001 with a conventional list of foreign policy priorities, led by a carefully rehearsed response to the rise of China, only to veer off sharply after the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>The most immediate global crisis now which is likely to be on the top of the Oval Office in-tray for whoever wins next month's election, is the Syrian conflict. Arguably the most striking sentence in the <a href=\"http:////www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-arm-syrian-rebels\" title=\"\">Republican candidate's speech</a> to the Virginia Military Institute on Monday relates to Syria. The current administration has allowed weapons supplies to flow to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other rebel groups from the Syrian diaspora, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, rather than provide them directly. Romney does not commit the US to supply arms, but talks about working with \"our international partners\" to deliver them. Whereas the Obama administration appears to have made great efforts to limit the flow largely to guns and ammunition, Romney said the rebels should be equipped with \"the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets\".</p> <p>The FSA has already been able to get hold of anti-tank weapons, both improvised and hi-tech, with the result that Syrian government forces now use tanks much more cautiously; they rely on helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft for bombarding pro-opposition city districts. Providing shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles in significant numbers could decisively tilt the strategic balance and accelerate the fall of the regime. Romney argues that such actions now would strengthen US leverage in a post-Assad Syria, mitigating the resentment towards Washington expressed by most opposition groups.</p> <p>However, such a policy would also have a wide array of other consequences, both intended and otherwise. Romney presents the move as directed as much at Iran as Assad.</p> <p>\"Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them,\" he said. \"We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran, rather than sitting on the sidelines.\"</p> <p>Such a confrontation would have the same repercussions that persuaded Obama to stay at arm's length. Michael O'Hanlon, a national security expert at the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/\" title=\"\">Brookings Institution</a> and an adviser to the CIA chief, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/jan/04/general-petraeus-whisky-cover-operators\" title=\"\">General David Petraeus</a>, said Iran could retaliate against US troops in Afghanistan. Furthermore, a substantial increase in the quantity and quality of the arms sent to the Syrian rebels would present a significant challenge to Moscow, previously described by Romney as America's \"no 1 enemy\". Russia might respond by upping its own support to Assad, raising the prospect of a proxy war.\"Syria may be the space where Romney may want to show he is prepared to confront Russia,\" O'Hanlon said. \"At the moment, the US is providing logistics. Obama feels that providing arms would cross a threshold with Russia ... Romney might not hold back in the same way.\"</p> <p>An escalation would have such far-reaching consequences, some Washington diplomats argued, that a Romney administration could well rethink the policy. They pointed out that his political career has hitherto been characterised principally by caution, and suggested that a true test of his intentions would be who, among the squabbling camps within his 30-strong coterie of foreign policy advisers, gets the big jobs if he wins.</p> <p>Currently, the advisers closest to the candidate are leaning towards the neo-conservative right, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-advisers\" title=\"\">Richard Williamson</a>, a veteran of the Ronald Reagan and George W Bush administrations, <a href=\"http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/senor_dan\" title=\"\">Dan Senor</a>, who served as a spokesman for the US-led occupation government in Baghdad after the 2003 invasion. Liz Cheney, daughter of the former vice-president Dick Cheney, is believed to have written some of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/us/politics/romney-remains-vague-on-foreign-policy-details.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=0&amp;hp\" title=\"\">Romney's commentaries and speeches</a> and, according to the New York Times, has begun to join a weekly conference call on foreign affairs issues with the candidate.</p> <p>However, the strategist on the Romney national security transition team is <a href=\"http://rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/Zoellick_Robert\" title=\"\">Robert Zoellick</a>, a former World Bank president and exponent of the moderate \"realist\" school of Republican foreign policy. In the European embassies in Washington, most bets are on him to become secretary of stateif Romney wins. The narrow favourite for defence secretary is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/condoleezza-rice\" title=\"\">Condoleezza Rice</a>, who helped shape the more cautious foreign policy of Bush's second term, and was given high billing at this year's Republican convention.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/profile/kagan_robert\" title=\"\">Robert Kagan</a>, a neoconservative historian and adviser to the candidate, agreed that a Romney White House would be unlikely to make radical foreign policy departures.</p> <p>\"There is a tremendous amount of continuity between presidents,\" Kagan said at a debate about America's place in the world last week organised by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"Any new president only changes things 10 degrees one way or 10 degrees another.\"</p> <p>Some Washington observers did not even detect 10 degrees of divergence. Spencer Ackerman, a writer on national security for Wired magazine, even suggested that with today's speech, Romney was in effect running \"for Obama's second term\".</p> <p>\"So Romney's foreign policy would be Obama's foreign policy, just with meaner things to say about Obama?,\" Ackerman tweeted.</p> <p>On a range of the major foreign affairs issues outlined by Romney, the harsh words directed at Obama are not matched by a significant difference in policy. So, on the Arab spring, Romney promised to support the democratic movements across North Africa, including in Libya, where he had been a vocal sceptic over western intervention.</p> <p>Similarly, despite his close links with Binyamin Netanyahu and his cynicism over the chance of a Middle East peace settlement inadvertently revealed <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/romney-secret-video-israeli-palestinian-middle-east-peace\" title=\"\">in a leaked video last month</a>, Romney official policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the long-term Washington orthodoxy of support for the creation of a Palestinian state alongside its Jewish neighbour. A Romney administration might be less active than a second Obama term in pursuing such a two-state solution, but Robert Malley, a Middle East expert at the <a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/\" title=\"\">International Crisis Group</a>, believes that Obama too \"sees there is, right now, no opportunity for a breakthrough.\"</p> <p>On Afghanistan too, Romney portrays himself as a fierce critic of Obama policy, but his formula for extricating the US \u2013 \"a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014\" \u2013 is identical to Obama's plan.</p> <p>The most important foreign policy and national security decision the next president is likely to have to take is whether to launch an attack on Iran with the aim of destroying or at least hindering its nuclear programme, either alone or in concert with Israel and other allies. That choice, O'Hanlon says, \"will be the centrepiece of the next presidency, whoever wins\".</p> <p>\"Obama may already feel he has been mired in two wars and a recession. He wants to do other things, and he recognises the interconnectedness of a decision about war to the entire presidency. Romney probably leans slightly more hawkish,\" O'Hanlon said.</p> <p>In contrast to his pledge to take Iran on directly in Syria, Romney's use of language about the Iranian nuclear crisis is more cautious, and again represents a duplicate of Obama administration policy. Like Obama, he suggests his red line would be to prevent Iran \"from acquiring nuclear weapons capability\", and would use sanctions as his primary tool to that end.</p> <p>Malley said that: \"The people around Romney say he is as unlikely as Obama to launch a strike against Iran.\"</p> <p>However, some long-term observers of US engagement with Iran voiced concern that Romney's inexperience in foreign policy and his tendency to \"shoot from the hip\" rhetorically could upset the precarious but enduring common front with Russia and China on Iran, that the Bush and Obama administrations both made the focus of their policy.</p> <p>\"The Romney approach will not be fundamentally different from Obama's, with one huge exception. Romney and some of his people will say things internationally that will split the coalition Obama has been so careful to build up,\" said <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/experts/?fa=expert_view&amp;expert_id=145\" title=\"\">George Perkovich</a>, an expert on non-proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Affairs.\"No one wants to go to war. The military has made it clear that nothing can be achieved by it, and Romney would get confronted by the military on the issue on his first day in office.\"</p> <p>The true significance of a shift from an Obama to a Romney foreign policy may only be revealed if Israel presses it into the open by forcing the next president's hand. Romney may respond very differently to an unilateral Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear sites than Obama, whose cool relationship with the Israeli leader could well colour Middle East policy if he wins a second term.</p> <p>Democratic foreign policy advisers suggest that an Obama White House would quickly warn Iran not to try to widen the conflict by attacking US interests or its Gulf allies. But a limited Iranian response to an Israeli strike, especially one where Washington isn't warned, might well be tolerated. That might not be true of Romney, who diplomats and analysts predict might be slightly more ready to go to war at Israel's side if forced into a corner. But it is hard to predict the instincts of a man who has so far appeared to give foreign policy relatively little attention. Romney's world, like Obama's, is more likely to be shaped by events than by doctrine.</p>",
  "<p>The EU should raise the price to businesses of producing carbon dioxide to reduce greenhouse gases and improve efficiency, the Liberal Democrat energy and climate minister told <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EUClimateAction\" title=\"\">a conference in London</a> on Monday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ed-davey\" title=\"\">Ed Davey</a> said the price to businesses was too low, because companies had been awarded an excess of permits to produce carbon under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/07/ets-emissions-trading\" title=\"\">EU's emissions trading scheme</a>, far greater than the number they need. If those excess permits were permanently cancelled, the price of emitting carbon for large consumers, such as power generators, would be shored up. This would give them more incentive to seek efficiencies and lower carbon fuels.</p> <p>Davey also repeated the government's position in calling for an EU-wide carbon reduction target of 30% by 2020, far tougher than the current target of 20%. The old target is too easily met, according to campaigners, and espousing the tougher goal would allow the EU to press other countries to adopt more stringent carbon limits.</p> <p>Many of Davey's coalition partners, and some sectors of business, do not agree with the higher target, however \u2013 including the chancellor, George Osborne, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/29/autumn-statement-george-osborne-green-policies\" title=\"\">who has argued that adopting tougher environmental regulations than the rest of the world could make the UK less competitive</a>. Almost at the same time as Davey was speaking, the chancellor of the exchequer was telling the Tory party conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shale-gas-tax\" title=\"\">he would offer tax breaks on the controversial practice of fracking for shale gas</a>, which could be a new source of fossil fuel for the UK.</p> <p>Davey also appeared to be hedging some of his bets, as earlier in the day he had delivered a speech at the <a href=\"http://www.gastech.co.uk/conference/\" title=\"\">Gastech conference</a> in east London, calling for a massive expansion of gas-fired power in the UK. The energy secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/gas-fired-power-stations-uk\" title=\"\">as revealed by the Guardian last week</a>, wants at least 20GW of new gas-fired electricity generation by 2030, equivalent to about 20 new power stations, or about a 50% increase on the current number.</p> <p>Davey has insisted that setting out such big targets for gas will not reduce the amount of investment for renewable energy. However, the UK is opposing plans to set a new 2030 target for renewable energy in Europe, which would replace the current target of generating 20% of energy from renewables, a goal that expires in 2020 with nothing as yet to replace it.</p> <p>Connie Hedegaard, the EU climate change commissioner, who was in London to launch <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/hedegaard/headlines/news/2012-10-08_01_en.htm\" title=\"\">an EU initiative</a> to promote the benefits of cutting emissions, said the European Commission was only in the early stages of looking at fresh targets. \"We are analysing, there are internal deliberations,\" she said. \"It is still very open.\"</p> <p>She said the current targets had played a key role in encouraging companies and governments to invest in renewables. She pointed to the strong growth in renewable energy in recent years, which she said would probably not have happened without clear targets. While Europe is ahead on renewable energy, it is behind on energy efficiency \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/14/uk-government-eu-energy-efficiency\" title=\"\">on which the bloc does not have a clear, legally binding commitment</a>.</p> <p>Investors like certainty, which targets can provide, she said. \"If you are an investor, you are already thinking beyond 2020.\"</p> <p>Hedegaard urged governments to look beyond the economic turmoil, saying that developing a green economy could be an answer to the recession, creating jobs and encouraging the efficient use of resources. She pointed out that Europe spends \u20ac573bn (\u00a3464bn) a year on imports of fossil fuels, a sum that could be cut with greater energy efficiency and more use of renewables.</p> <p>She said citizens were more aware of climate change than governments often gave them credit for, and the recent years of unusual weather \u2013 droughts followed by severe flooding this summer in the UK, wildfires in Europe and droughts in the US that have raised food prices \u2013 had heightened people's concern.</p> <p>But some people were still afraid that dealing with climate change would mean spending vast amounts of money or lower standards of living, she said. Neither was really the case, she argued but, in order to convince people, governments should be presenting the positive sides of dealing with climate change, as well as the threats from global warming. These positives include cleaner air and water, health benefits such as lower rates of respiratory problems, \"smart living\" with modern energy efficient appliances, a healthier way of life with more green space and better urban planning and public transport.</p> <p>\"This isn't about being dull and grey. it's about smarter living. It's bright and attractive,\" she said.</p>",

His proposals, they said, were a mixture of neo-conservative ideas from the Bush era and policies that Obama was already pursuing.</p> <p>In his toughest language yet against Obama's foreign policy record, Romney said: \"When we look at the Middle East today \u2014 Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threatening to destabilise the region, with violent extremists on the march and with an American ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of al-Qaida \u2014 it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the president took office.\"</p> <p>Apart from a shift towards backing the supply of heavier weaponry to Syrian rebels \u2013 by Saudi Arabia and Qatar \u2013 Romney had little new to say and leaves unanswered many key foreign policy questions.</p> <p>He reiterated his intent to confront Russia \u2013 even though many American foreign policy analysts see al-Qaida rather than Russia as the main threat to the US \u2013 and Iran.</p> <p>Although the language on Iran is tough, Romney proposed a mixture of threats and sanctions that were not dissimilar to the Obama administration's current approach.</p> <p>In his speech, Romney made the case for a more interventionist US foreign policy. \"Our friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership \u2026 This is what makes America exceptional. It is not just the character of our country; it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership \u2013 a history that has been written by patriots of both parties.\"</p> <p>He accused Obama of \"missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East, friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us.\"</p> <p>He quoted a Syrian woman as saying: \"We will not forget that you forgot about us.\"</p> <p>The speech was heavily trailed in advance, including an excerpt in which Romney promised more help for the rebels, who are out-gunned by the the forces of President Bashar al-Assad, which are using tanks, jets and helicopters.</p> <p>\"Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran \u2013 rather than sitting on the sidelines,\" he said.</p> <p>Romney's comments received a positive response from Syrian rebel leaders. Mustafa Sheikh, joint head of the Free Syrian Army military council, said: \"We welcome, and we need, any American support, whether that be weapons, money, or anything we can use. The Americans need not be afraid that their support will go to the wrong people, or be wasted. It will be appreciated and it will be valuable. We appreciate that this is now being discussed.\"</p> <p>Romney also criticised Obama over his handling of the killing of the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, noting the contrast between the administration initially blaming riots over an anti-Muslim movie made in the US and a recent statement pointing to al-Qaida elements.</p> <p>One of the most awkward parts of the speech was Romney's reaffirmation of the traditional US role as a supposed arbiter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This contrasted with his speech in May, caught on a secret video, in which he said the Palestinians were not interested in peace, the chances of a peace agreement was remote and the whole issue should be kicked down the field.</p> <p>On Afghanistan, over which Romney has faced a lot of criticism for failing to mention it during his Republican convention speech, he said he would not be tied to the deadline set by Obama for withdrawal by the end of 2014 and hinted he might delay it.</p> <p>\"The route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11,\" he said.</p> <p>The former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who has been called in to help the Obama team, told reporters that there was a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of specifics. She said Romney did not seem to understand America's role in the 21st century and his identification of Russia as the number one enemy reflected a nostalgia for cold war thinking.</p> <p>\"I would like to ask Govenor Romney and his advisers how he would do things differently,\" she said.</p> <p>The Obama campaign issued an ad saying Romney had already failed the commander-in-chief test, citing his accident-prone tour of the UK, Israel and Poland in the summer and various comments since then. </p> <p>The ad says: \"If this is how he handles the world now, just think of what Romney might do as president.</p> <p>It also said he was telling outright lies, as when he said Obama had signed no trade deals. Obama's team said he had signed three.</p>",
  "<p>BAE Systems and EADS are fighting to keep their proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) merger on track amid mounting shareholder opposition and wrangling between the British, German and French governments over the plan.</p> <p>Invesco Perpetual, BAE's biggest shareholder with 13.3% of the company, took the unusual step of going public with its concerns on Monday, before Wednesday's UK Takeover Panel deadline for both groups to thrash out an agreement.</p> <p>Invesco said it could not see the rationale for the merger between Britain's biggest defence contractor and the owner of Airbus. \"Other than diversification \u2013 which investors can achieve for themselves more cheaply and simply \u2013 Invesco does not understand the strategic logic for the proposed combination,\" the fund manager said.</p> <p>The intervention, which echoes concerns raised by the EADS shareholder Lagard\u00e8re and some Conservative MPs, makes it likely that there will be an extension to Wednesday's deadline.</p> <p>In a point-by-point critique, Invesco added that the deal would \"materially jeopardise\" BAE's position in the US defence market; the proposed holding of stakes by the French and German governments would result in a business driven by politics and not by shareholder value; and there would be lower dividends for BAE shareholders in the future.</p> <p>\"Invesco believes BAE is a strong business with distinctive positions in the global defence market (especially in the US and UK) and good standalone prospects. We look forward to discussions with the board of BAE and other BAE shareholders in the coming days,\" it said.</p> <p>Invesco's damning analysis of the deal struck a chord with other City institutions, which felt that BAE has yet to effectively communicate the reasons for the tie-up, putting the company's chief executive, Ian King, under pressure to explain the strategy behind the transaction.</p> <p>His hands are tied until the offer documents are published, which will also provide more detail about how the companies agreed to a valuation that would see EADS shareholders emerge with 60% of the business compared with BAE's 40%. There has been grumbling from both shareholder registers over the split.</p> <p>\"There's never been a clear articulation of this concept,\" one BAE investor said. \"The problems are beginning to look insurmountable.\" Another said: \"The odds are stacked against it because there are so many challenges.\"</p> <p>Invesco's outburst came as representatives of the UK, French and German governments held further discussions in a bid to break an impasse over the structure of the new company. One BAE investor, remarking on Invesco's \"surprising\" statement, said: \"The deal already seems to be struggling, without shareholders needing to get involved.\"</p> <p>The UK can block the deal under the terms of its golden share in BAE, while the French and German governments control 22.35% each of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings. Talks to resolve the future of the governmental interests in BAE and EADS are running parallel to the corporate process, which suffered a serious stumble with the Invesco intervention.</p> <p>It is not just national security at stake, but tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs in each country. In the UK alone, BAE and EADS employ more than 50,000 people.</p> <p>Under the ideal scenario for the UK government, the French and German states would emerge with stakes of 9% each in the merged business. The French media conglomerate Lagard\u00e8re \u2013 a 7.5% shareholder in EADS and another critic of the deal \u2013 would have to sell down its stake in order to ensure that the French state's stake does not creep into double figures. This is an assurance that is being sought by the UK government as well as Berlin. The German interest in EADS is represented by Daimler, the car manufacturer, which would transfer some of its stake to the state-owned KfW in a process that would help create the 9% German shareholding.</p> <p>A source with knowledge of the government talks said they were on a knife-edge. They were pushed closer to the precipice on Friday when German officials used a conference call with their French and UK counterparts to ask for guarantees on the size of the French shareholding and, then, that the headquarters of the combined company would be in Munich. The latter demand shocked all parties, including BAE and EADS, because it was thought the business would be based at the Airbus HQ in Toulouse, with Farnborough in Hampshire as the head office of the defence business. Pushing for Munich, said one source, could collapse the deal.</p> <p>On Monday, the British defence secretary, Philip Hammond, said he wanted France and Germany's interests represented by single-digit stakes. He added: \"We believe for this to work this company has to be allowed to operate as a commercial company, and not as a branch of the French or German government, and that means a reduction in the stakes held by the French and German governments.</p> <p>\"We have made our position clear, so let us see what happens,\" he said.</p> <p>Speaking after the latest tripartite discussions on Monday, a UK government source said: \"The talks are continuing.\"</p> <p>In France, some commentary has been critical of the UK's concerns. Last night, Le Monde said the talks were entering a critical period. It said: \"Does the United Kingdom want a written engagement from France or simple assurances that the two countries will not use their shares to influence the decisions of the new company? Nothing is clear cut. London has in any case confirmed, through Hammond, that it will block the deal if France and Germany try to keep their influence over the running of the new group.\"</p> <p>German economic commentators described the merger talks as close to collapse, with political stalemate being cited as the biggest barrier. Germany is fearful of being marginalised because the French and British governments have apparently decided on the terms of a tie-up, sources close to the government said. The subsequent need to redress a perceived imbalance led to the Munich demand.</p> <p>Analysts added that if the merger did go ahead, the biggest losers could end up being the employees of EADS. Discussions between EADS and IG Metall, Germany's top metal workers' union, broke down at the end of last week over fears that job security is not guaranteed in the event of a merger. J\u00fcrgen Kerner, a member of IG's executive board, said workers felt let down at the lack of solidarity shown to them by the company's management.</p> <p>\"We are disappointed that no actions have followed the fancy promises of EADS's executive board,\" he said. He added a merger would only work if EADS's 50,000 employees in Germany were given job guarantees.</p> <p>However, it is understood that Bernard Gray, the Ministry of Defence's head of procurement, has been using US government concerns over the transaction, and the unease on the Tory backbenches about job security, to leverage a better deal for Britain. The formidable obstacle of Washington is next and it is one that is being eyed nervously by BAE shareholders. If a deal is agreed between European governments, the transaction moves across the Atlantic to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a state body chaired by the US treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner. Because the Pentagon is BAE's biggest single customer, a merger with another foreign entity requires the blessing of CFIUS. Clay Lowery, a former US treasury official who oversaw the CFIUS process under George W Bush, said he expected the deal to go through, but scrutiny is likely to last longer than 75 days \u2013 the minimum 30-day inquiry plus a 45-day extension. \"I believe if this transaction comes together it will go through. But some of the national security mitigation steps could be tougher than they are currently for BAE. And it could be a longer negotiation than 75 days,\" said Lowery.</p> <p>BAE's US interests, as well as those of EADS, are covered by special security arrangements that ringfence the operation of Pentagon contracts from non-US interference. For instance, the board of BAE's US subsidiary, BAE Systems Inc, must be dominated by US nationals and the unit cannot operate outside the US without the Pentagon's blessing. Lowery added CFIUS could require that the combined BAE and EADS US business becomes a \"proxy\" company sealed off from its owner, with the parent receiving the profits and nothing else. This was one scenario Invesco was alluding to when it warned that the deal could \"heavily impair\" BAE's commercial prospects \u2013 \"especially in the US\".</p> <p>The Financial Times reported that at least six of the biggest 20 BAE shareholders are warning that they support Invesco.</p> <p>Lowery added: \"he focus at BAE and EADS has got to be what's going on in France, Germany, Spain and the UK, as well, of course, as with their shareholders and employees. But at some point they will have to turn to the US and the CFIUS process.\" If BAE and EADS overcome Monday's ructions and bring France, Germany and the UK together, more difficulties certainly lie ahead.</p>",

Here are a few thoughts:</p> <p>\u2022 More people will turn up to David Cameron's speech on Wednesday - partly because it will be held in a much bigger hall. But the reception and atmosphere tonight was less like a political speech and more like some form of live entertainment: Boris was cheered and applauded to the rafters, and the scenes when he arrived in the middle of the crowd and made his way to the stage, with heads turning and people leaping up from their seats, bordered on megalomania. All this for a politician. Cameron's reception will be nothing like that. I think Boris showed tonight beyond doubt that in terms of his public image he is one of a kind, and is gathering strength. His conference speech last year was well-attended and well-received, but the fuss and buzz was nothing like this. Unbelievably, he is scheduled to speak again in the main hall tomorrow morning. The conference organisers could not have planned this better to build momentum for the mayor at the expense of Cameron.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Boris was conspicuously loyal, praising Cameron and the coalition and attacking Labour and Eds Miliband and Balls. But wasn't it strange to say that \"while I am mayor\" Labour could get back into power - something surely designed to conjure up the image of himself as the leading anti-Labour force? And his firm opposition to a third runway at Heathrow seemed to be aimed squarely at the coalition: \"Move off that idea. It's not going to happen. We need a better solution.\" The supposed point of this rally, his passing on of advice on how to beat Labour, was skipped over speedily - perhaps because his own experience in London is almost completely irrelevant to the national Tory party's attempt to win in 2015.</p> <p>\u2022 He used all his usual rhetorical tricks: he was funny, irreverent, self-deprecating, multilingual, anti-French, policy-light, and a political clothes-stealer, even at one point making a slight dig at Margaret Thatcher, when he said: \"The 103 bodies that can dig up the roads - basically under Thatcherite legislation put down when very few private utilities existed \u2026 We have finally got to grips with the consequences of that legislation.\" To put it mildly, even this kind of timid criticism of Thatcher is unheard of here. But the crowd showed no objection, something as impressive and unexpected in its way as Boris's achievement in getting the London Olympic parade to cheer the name G4S.</p> <p>\u2022 I've learned one other thing too.

Before previous elections, \"that kind of talk, meetings like this, seemed awfully interesting \u2026 but when the election actually came it was judged by history to have been decided by quite different factors.\" The party the Tory party most had to fear was the Tory party itself, he said.

Hunt said: \"It's clearly a setback. It's a massive unfairness in the system.

But he could get more money from top rate taxpayers more easily.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's pretty hard for any government to make serious savings without doing something on welfare. [Osborne has] ruled out a higher rate of income tax ... he's ruled out this big extra increase in housing taxation. What does that leave? It sort of depends on what you mean by the rich.</p> <p>You might mean by the rich that top 1% who pay 50p tax at the moment. If he's not going to do anything with that tax rate then beyond avoidance and evasion measures, there is not a lot you can do unless you're going to do something with wealth or housing.</p> <p>But if by rich you mean the four million or so of us who pay the 40p, then clearly you can do a lot more, including increasing that, increasing national insurance contributions, increasing other bits of council tax.</p> <p>[Osborne] didn't define what he meant by rich which makes it very easy for everyone to think I'm not rich, someone else is going to pay.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nick Pearce</strong>, the director of the&#xa0;Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said the Treasury could over time achieve huge savings by raising benefits in line with earnings rather than inflation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Earnings growth has been weak this year, and using the relevant three-month average figure to July 2012 would mean benefits are uprated by 1.5%, rather than the 2.5% expected level of CPI.</p> <p>This might not look like much, but it will be applied to a baseline of some \u00a350bn of spending, depending on how wide the chancellor casts his net, and the new baseline will then be lower for the uprating in subsequent years - such that, by 2016/17, the government will be making quite large benefit savings.</p> <p>This kind of fiscal drag for the poor is a favourite Treasury manoeuvre to cut social security spending.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:59:48.592Z\">at 4.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072ddc4c0e361310bc6c9e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T14:05:56.899Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some more reaction to the George Osborne speech.</p> <p>From <strong>Craig Bennett</strong>, Friends of the Earth policy and campaigns director:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Generous shale gas tax breaks show the chancellor clearly isn\u2019t listening to the increasingly vociferous warnings from leading politicians, businesses and climate experts about his reckless dash for gas.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Slashing people's employment rights under the guise of ownership schemes won't create jobs and it won't create growth.</p> <p>His attempts to dupe the electorate that he knows what he is doing have been rumbled. George Osborne has as much knowledge about economics as a stick of rhubarb.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Longworth,</strong> director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osborne was right to acknowledge that the country must face up to the challenge of global competitiveness through enterprise, effort, aspiration and a real sense of urgency. We face a choice of becoming a Ruritanian museum or a dynamic and prosperous economy, which could be uncomfortable for some in the Conservative party.</p> <p>The chancellor's announcement of a new form of business ownership, with individuals swapping greater employment flexibility for an equity stake in the company, could be a useful option for some new and fast-growing businesses. It is an innovative and imaginative proposal that deserves to be tried out, but it is unlikely to be a game-changer.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, general secretary of Unite:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Osborne's repetition of 'we are all in this together' is an insult to millions of families struggling to make ends meet and meaningless to the one in seven children who regularly go without a hot meal. His cuts will turn decent people into desperate people.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Helen Barnard</strong>, programme manager for poverty at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cutting benefits for groups who receive little public sympathy may make for a good conference speech, but it risks increasing poverty and hardship. And unless there is a follow-up masterplan for creating more and better jobs, massively increasing access to them and sorting out the housing crisis, it's not likely to do as much as those advocating further cuts are hoping to reduce the deficit or people's dependency on the state.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Campbell Robb</strong>, chief executive of Shelter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most under-25s who can live with their parents already do so. Being under 25 is being used as shorthand for people who don\u2019t have responsibilities or adult commitments, whereas in reality more than half of young people who claim housing benefit already have a family of their own. Others have left home to get married, move for job opportunities, or escape serious problems in their family home.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Sarah Jackson</strong>, chief executive of Working Families, a work-life balance charity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employers beware. Offering owner employee contracts - where employees effectively sell their employment rights for shares - is unlikely to deliver the highly motivated, engaged workforce you need.</p> <p>Few men or women with family responsibilities would want such a contract and we would advise callers to our free legal helpline to think long and hard before accepting such a one-way deal. Shares can go down as well as up. You could end up with no job security or employment rights and worthless shares.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Fiona Weir,</strong> chief executive of Gingerbread, the charity for single parents:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This announcement [the proposed welfare cuts] comes at a time when families are already struggling, and risks plunging even more children into poverty. It\u2019s vital that we separate fact from fiction. The vast majority of people who receive government support do so because they can\u2019t earn enough to support their families, or even find a job in the first place.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T16:05:57.920Z\">at 5.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072d5db58f91d7bbadac0b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:32:11.866Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Clegg</strong> has been talking about the welfare cuts being floated by George Osborne.

(<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/sep/25/liberaldemocrats-clegg-cameron-miliband-interactive\">You can also see that in this graphic of Guardian/ICM polls since the election</a>.)</p> <p>\"The budget was the worst received budget since the late 1990s,\" said Ipsos Mori's Gideon Skinner. \"Across all ages, across all social classes, across men and women, the Conservative vote has fallen,\" he said. \"They have gone to the left, to the right. You've lost votes to Ukip, but the same number [5%] to Labour. It's not gone just to one wing or one demographic group. The fall is just as much among urban voters as it is among rural.\"</p> <p>\"David Cameron's ratings are falling as well,\" he added. Showing graphs comparing the popularity of incoming prime ministers, he said: \"Cameron's ratings are not a million miles away from where Gordon Brown's were at the same time.\"</p> <p>Ed Miliband, meanwhile, \"has at least steadied the fall\" in his ratings - but all these figures were compiled before the conference speech Miliband made last week that has been widely hailed as an important move towards improving his image.</p> <p>Skinner said of the 2012 budget: \"The rhetoric, the story of 'we're all in it together', it just doesn't resonate with people.\"</p> <p>One chink of light for the Conservatives was that the economy remained the public's number one concern. \"It's all about the economy, the economy, the economy and jobs,\" Skinner said, and the Tories still have a lead over Labour on that issue - albeit only one of 30-25.</p> <p>Fraser Nelson of the Spectator said the budget had been so disastrous for the government not because it was harsh, \"but because it was so comically, shambolically delivered. People just got the general sense that the government doesn't know what it's doing.\"</p> <p>Skinner mentioned in passing that Europe remained low on the public's list of concerns, but Rory Stewart, the Penrith and the Border MP with a colourful background in Iraq and Afghanistan, expressed scepticism about this, given that Cameron's EU \"veto\" in December 2011 had bumped up his personal ratings.</p> <p>\"Let's just focus on Europe for a second,\" he said (in truth, it's never far from the surface here), going on to say that there was a strong argument for an EU referendum given that \"since the 1970s people have not become comfortable with Europe and the politicians have not given people a chance to express that, and this is fundamentally unjust\". He conceded though that this didn't really matter much if people didn't feel strongly about this \"crisis of legitimacy\", as the polls suggest.</p> <p>My impression was that he didn't quite believe the polls on this point, however, and Nelson backed him on this, saying: \"They do [care about Europe].

Announcing the scheme<a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/George_Osborne.aspx\"> in his speech, </a>he took inspiration from Marx.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a voluntary three-way deal.</p> <p>You the company: give your employees shares in the business.</p> <p>You the employee: replace your old rights of unfair dismissal and redundancy with new rights of ownership.</p> <p>And what will the government do?</p> <p>We'll charge no capital gains tax at all on the profit you make on your shares ...<br>&#xa0;<br>Owners, workers and the taxman, all in it together.</p> <p>Workers of the world unite.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He announced that he was consulting on tax cuts for shale gas.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An enterprise strategy means investing in renewable energy, and opening up the newly discovered shale gas reserves beneath our land.</p> <p>We are today consulting on a generous new tax regime for shale so that Britain is not left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the Atlantic.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Tories were still committed to the \"we're all in this together\" philosophy that they proclaimed before the general election. </strong></p> <p>The Tories have been reluctant to use this slogan recently (partly because Rebekah Wade used the phrase to describe the party's links with News International, and partly because the cut in the top rate of tax and other moves have made it less plausible). Ed Miliband's decision to rebrand Labour as a one-nation party was also a deliberate attempt to occupy this ground. But Osborne said the sentiment still applied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the eve of the election, I told this conference: we're all in this together.</p> <p>It was more than a slogan. It spoke of our values and of our intent ...</p> <p>Three years later, my message remains the same:</p> <p>We're not going to get through this as a country if we set one group against another, if we divide, denounce and demonise.</p> <p>We need an effort from each and every one.</p> </blockquote> <p>In another passage in the speech he insisted that the Conservatives were the real one-nation party, although he defined one-nation almost entirely in terms of the group also being defined as \"strivers\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We modern Conservatives represent all those who aspire, all who work, save and hope, all who feel a responsibility to put in, not just take out.</p> <p>Whether it's the owner of the corner shop staying open until midnight to support their family.</p> <p>Or the teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the after-school club.</p> <p>Or the commuter who leaves home before the children are up, and comes back long after they have gone to bed, because they want a better life for them.</p> <p>Or the pensioner, who has saved all their life, and doesn't want to spend it all as they want to pass something on to their children.</p> <p>Or the entrepreneur who doesn't cash out and pack up, but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story.</p> <p>They are all part of one nation, one nation working together to get on.</p> <p>That is the nation we represent.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that, as the government tried to find savings worth \u00a316bn in the next spending round, he wanted 80% of the money to come from spending cuts rather than tax rises (as happened in the last round of spending cuts).</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he and Iain Duncan Smith had agreed to reduce welfare spending by \u00a310bn by 2015 and he identified three areas where there would be cuts: indexing benefits in line with inflation; housing benefit for the young; benefits for families with several children.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For how can we justify the incomes of those out of work rising faster than the incomes of those in work?</p> <p>How can we justify giving flats to young people who have never worked, when working people twice their age are still living with their parents because they can't afford their first home?</p> <p>How can we justify a system where people in work have to consider the full financial costs of having another child, whilst those who are out of work don't?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he had increased taxes overall on the very richest in every budget he had introduced.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In every single year of this parliament the rich will pay a greater share of our nation's tax revenues than in any one of the 13 years that Labour were in office.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that when it came to getting the wealthy to pay more, his priority would be dealing with tax evasion and tax avoidance.</strong></p> <p>He would continue to insist on those with \"the broadest shoulders\" paying the most, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it comes to the richest, the first place I will look is to those who are still not paying the taxes we expect them to pay today.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was unrealistic to cut the size of the public sector any faster than it is already being cut.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're reducing the size of government, from almost 50% of our national income to 40%, in just five years.</p> <p>I just don't think it's realistic to cut a great deal faster than that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government would not abandon its economic strategy.</strong></p> <p>Edward Heath did in 1972, and the result was \"more inflation, more strikes and the three day week\". Margaret Thatcher held firm in 1981 and she succeeded. Osborne said the government would follow Thatcher.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, in the face of the great economic challenges of our age we resolve: we will press on and we shall overcome.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was \"the most radical and reforming\" for a generation.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that some western countries would become \"poorer and poorer\" in the face of global competition.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Western democracies like ours are being out-worked, out-competed and out-smarted by these new economies.</p> <p>The question for countries like Britain is this: are we going to sink or swim?</p> <p>And the truth is some western countries won't keep up, they won't make the changes needed to welfare and education and tax, they'll fall further and further behind ...<br>&#xa0;<br>... they'll become poorer and poorer.</p> <p>I am determined that will not be the Britain I leave to my children, or you leave to yours.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:37:58.637Z\">at 4.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072cbcdc0e361310bc6c9d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T12:49:17.705Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's reaction to Osborne's speech from <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor was right to remind Britain that there is no real alternative to deficit reduction.

None of us wants to make the lives of the less well-off even more difficult.</p> <p>To achieve this, we need to deliver better public services at lower cost and, in my view, the government needs to be bolder in bringing in charities and companies with innovative ways of serving the public.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is what he said about the employee-owner scheme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In some of Britain's cutting-edge entrepreneurial companies, the option of share ownership may be attractive to workers, rather than some of their employment rights.

And he failed to mention growth or set out any policies to deliver the jobs and growth we need to get the deficit down.</p> <p>The reason why George Osborne has been forced to talk about billions more cuts into the next parliament is because his failure to deliver economic growth means he will break his promise to balance the books by 2015. There do need to be savings in the welfare budget, but the benefits bill is soaring under this government because unemployment is so high.</p> <p>He will never be a one nation chancellor when he is pressing ahead with a tax cut for millionaires while asking millions of pensioners and families to pay more.

Our members know what it's like to take tough decisions in order to succeed, and he is right to stick to that path.</p> <p>The IoD applauds his innovative proposal on employee ownership, which could make a real difference to jobs and shareholding. This scheme has the potential to reduce the employment law burden on companies and make employees better off at the same time. The key to the success of the idea will be in encouraging employers and workers to make use of it.</p> <p>The chancellor is also right to hail the potential of shale gas. As we have argued, shale gas represents a really valuable asset, right on our own doorstep.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Chris Leslie</strong>, a shadow Treasury minister:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To hear the chancellor of the exchequer you\u2019d think that all was rosy in the garden, growth was motoring ahead. He didn\u2019t mention unemployment, he didn\u2019t really confront that issue about borrowing actually quite significantly higher \u2013 22% higher this year. Surely what our task is now, before we get to 2015, is to focus on job creation.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Rhian Beynon</strong>, head of policy at Family Action:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Osborne is scraping the barrel for cuts that do not make good economic sense. Removing housing benefit from under 25s will make it even more difficult for hard pressed young people to find employment and move on. It is not the answer. Neither is punishing children because a parent is out of work. There is already a welfare cap coming in which places limitations on benefits for large families. These further cuts to the welfare budget could spell disaster for the children and families we support.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Ceri Goddard</strong>, the Fawcett Society\u2019s chief executive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the government pursues yet another massive swath of welfare cuts it will be critical, and a legal requirement, that they properly assess and are upfront about how this could further disadvantage women far more than men.</p> <p>If, as seems likely, women will be yet again worst hit when it comes to a further reduction in welfare, the government will either have to properly and publicly justify this or tell us how they intend to mitigate the effects of such a such a skewed impact.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:28:53.744Z\">at 2.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072c1d6c0e361310bc6c9ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T12:06:46.216Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/George_Osborne.aspx\">The full text of Osborne's speech is now on the Conservative party's conference website.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1859f4f6-5ab7-4e59-a15e-d17f73f11a64\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349701628188/George-Osborne-010.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chancellor in full flow.

Priti Patel (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\">one of the rising stars of the Tory right wing</a>), said that if the European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso \"wants to press ahead with a treaty change before 2015 that is going to be a real wake-up call for our prime minister and our government\".</p> <p>She added: \"We cannot sit back and watch some shoddy deal \u2026 without giving the British public a say.\" This was a \"tremendous opportunity for a British prime minister to rebalance our relationship and put Britain first\".</p> <p>Daniel Hannan, the Tory MEP and popular anti-EU lightning rod, also called for a referendum. He pointed out that in May the combined GDP of the Commonwealth overtook that of the eurozone, and lamented: \"We are obliged to restrict trade with the growing bits of the world in the way that we didn't do in the 1930s.\" Meanwhile, \"Europe is now spiralling down as it mulishly does all the things that have caused it to be in its present predicament.\"</p> <p>The ubiquitous ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie warned that it would be more difficult to win an EU referendum than many anti-Brussels campaigners thought. \"The polls are not as wide in our support as some of us would like to believe. From the AV referendum we know that the British people tend to prefer the status quo unless there is a very good reason to change, and I think that would be the case with either renegotiation or leaving.\"</p> <p>All that was before the anti-EU side had to grapple with the opposition of business and the media and before the EU could make \"cosmetic\" changes to try to head off a UK exit.</p> <p>He added: \"Are we organised for the moment if David Cameron finally - or some other person - gives it to us? Probably at the moment the answer to that question is no.\"</p> <p>Hannan and Patel agreed with all that, but Patrick O'Flynn of the Daily Express, also on the panel, demurred, saying: \"There is no status quo.

Here are some stories and articles particularly worth reading.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/07/david-cameron-where-did-all-go-wrong\">\u2022 Andy Beckett says, in a long feature in the Guardian, that David Cameron has lost his aura.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All prime ministers ultimately fray and weaken. But Cameron has done so fast: \"His shelf life has narrowed incredibly,\" says Tim Bale of the University of London, a historian of the modern Conservative party and its troubled post-Thatcher leaders. John Curtice of the University of Strathclyde, a leading authority on voter attitudes, says: \"People used to think Cameron was charismatic. But he is proving to be a kind of average prime minister. His ratings are not terrible, but he's not Thatcher, he's not Blair. He is not a dominant figure. Nobody loves him. That is why the Boris story is taking off.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/iainmartin/9593221/David-Cameron-at-the-Conservative-conference-the-seven-year-itch.html\">\u2022 Iain Martin in the Telegraph says a good speech will not be enough for Cameron to rally his party.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As he demonstrated in his pre-conference interviews, when he is fired-up the Prime Minister can be highly impressive. Labour, or his Tory critics, would be foolish to underestimate him. Gordon Brown made that mistake when he became Prime Minister, regarding his opponent as a chinless wonder and privileged weakling. In October 2007, in the week of the infamous election that never was, Mr Cameron bounced back with another powerful peroration: \u201cCall that election. We will fight. Britain will win.\u201d</p> <p>But the reminder of that speech, made five years ago last week, illustrates Mr Cameron\u2019s dilemma. By now his party is used to these last-minute rescue jobs. It knows that Mr Cameron excels at giving speeches in a crisis, when his back is against the wall. The question is whether anything really changes once the microphone is turned off.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dissatisfied-tories-want-cameron-to-stand-down-if-he-fails-to-win-overall-majority-at-next-election-8201191.html\">\u2022 Andrew Grice in the Independent says that a survey suggests a majority of party members want David Cameron to step down if he does not win an overall majority in 2015.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conservative Party members are dissatisfied with David Cameron and want him to stand down if he fails to win an overall majority at the next election, according to a survey for The Independent.</p> <p>It suggests the Prime Minister will come under strong pressure to quit even if the Conservatives remain the largest party after the 2015 election and he tries to continue the Coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Tory MPs who want Boris Johnson to take over are already plotting a coup in the event of another hung parliament. They say they would force an immediate Tory leadership contest if Mr Cameron fails to secure an overall majority-even if he is still in Downing Street with the Lib Dems' backing.</p> <p>The survey of 1,872 Tory members, conducted by the ConservativeHome website, shows that 67 per cent want Mr Cameron to stand down if he fails to win an outright election victory for a second time, while only 23 per cent do not.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/10/50-of-tory-members-are-satisfied-with-david-cameron-49-are-not.html\">Here are more details of the ConservativeHome poll.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/welcome-to-the-nasty-party-conference-8201320.html\">\u2022 Andy McSmith in the Independent says an anti-gay marriage rally taking place today will undermine Cameron's attempts to modernise the party's image.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron has been warned that his attempts to shed the Conservative Party's \"nasty party\" image are being undermined by organisers of a mass rally against gay marriage.</p> <p>About 900 people, the majority of them active members of the Conservative Party, will crowd into Birmingham Town Hall at lunchtime today to hear the former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, the former Home Office minister Ann Widdecombe and others give speeches on why there should be no change in the legal definition of marriage to recognise same-sex couples.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3561457.ece\">\u2022 Sam Coates in the Times (paywall) says seven global energy companies are threatening to withdraw investments from Britain because George Osborne is watering down the government's green commitments.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Seven global electricity and nuclear technology companies are threatening today to withdraw plans for hundreds of millions of pounds of future investment in Britain because of attempts by George Osborne to water down the Government\u2019s green commitments.</p> <p>Siemens, the engineering giant, Alstom UK, the infrastructure and energy company, Mitsubishi Power Systems and four other companies, which together employ 17,500 people in the British energy sector, say that a lack of decision-making and threats to relax key targets \u201chave caused us to reassess the level of political risk in the UK\u201d.

Here's an extract from the Treasury briefing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government will add \u00a3200m of new money to the Research Partnership Investment Fund, which supports university capital projects. The Fund was launched at budget 2012, with \u00a3100m of funding but has been heavily oversubscribed with an overwhelming number of high-calibre bids.</p> <p>To access the money, universities must at least double the public funding through contributions from private companies or charities. So, by tripling the Government support to \u00a3300m, the total investment, including the universities own contributions, is expected to be at least \u00a31bn.</p> <p>This additional funding will more than double the number of projects that will benefit, accelerating further private and charity sector investment in the research base and encouraging university and business collaboration which will help to promote jobs and growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>The successful projects include: a Warwick University project, with Jaguar Land Rover and Tata Motors, working on the next generation of green cars; a Birmingham University project with Rolls Royce involving turbine blades; a Surrey University project on 5G phones (yes, 5G); <br>an Oxford University cancer research project; and a Liverpool University materials project.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T10:22:34.779Z\">at 11.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50728fc0c0e3aacd18e2f8f0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T08:33:04.644Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Janan Ganesh, the Financial Times columnist, has written a biography of George Osborne and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214394/The-dandy-iron-He-Madonna-fan-Oscar-Wilde-But-new-biography-reveals-George-Osborne-ALWAYS-eye-fixed-power.html\">the first extract - about his childhood - is in the Daily Mail today.</a> There aren't any huge surprises, although there is a nice story about Osborne pretending to be a member of the under-21 England football team when he visited Africa.

Here are the main points. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne has conceded that austerity could last until 2018.</strong><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2b77439c-0f0d-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F2b77439c-0f0d-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fworld%2Fuk\"> Today the Financial Times (paywall) is splashing on a story saying that, based on its own calculation, Britain will not get the deficit under control until then. </a>Asked about this timetable, Osborne said: \"I'm saying, yes, the road is longer than anyone hoped. We've got to find more cuts.\" In a separate interview, when asked about the FT story, Osborne blamed Labour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, who is responsible for creating these debts? I didn't rack up these debts. Ed Balls, who actually wants to take my job, is the man who racked up these debts.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne said the Tories wanted some of the savings to come from welfare and that this was a dividing line with Labour.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be clear, those with the broadest shoulders must bear the broadest burden but our perception of fairness - and this is perhaps where we differ from the Labour party - also extends to the welfare system.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused some people of abusing the welfare system.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We also think it is unfair that person leaves their home early in the morning and they pull the door behind them and they are going to do their job and they look at their next-door neighbour, the blinds are down and that family is living a life on benefits. That is unfair as well and we are going to tackle that as part of tackling this country's economic problems.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he wanted a public debate on whether it was fair to limit child-related benefits available to the unemployed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When you are on benefits you automatically get extra money when you have a child, so, you can be better off ... We are just asking the question, does that work? Is that the right value we have in our society?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He also questioned whether it was fair to pay housing benefit to people who go straight from school onto the dole, and he said the government would propose specific policy measures over the next few months to address these issues.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that advocating a 50p top rate of tax was \"a phoney conception of fairness\".</strong> Under the coalition, the rich were paying more in tax than under Labour, he said. But he abolished the 50p rate because it was making Britain \"uncompetitive\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The people who were paying the price for that phoney 50p rate were actually the poor looking for work, not the rich. So I found other ways to tax the rich. We\u2019re clamping down on tax avoidance in a way that has never been done before in this country.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T09:13:05.706Z\">at 10.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072835958f93d334375427c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T07:40:09.442Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AntiAstroturfer in the comments has spotted a wonderful typo in an earlier post.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 0814, a great typo:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Q: Shouldn't you admit that you will miss your target to have debt falling by 2015?</p> <p>Osborne says he has cut the budget deficit by 25%.

For example, is it right that school leavers should be able to move directly from school to a life on housing benefit without finding a job first?</p> <p>Is it right that people in work have to consider the full financial costs of having another child while those who are out of work don\u2019t?</p> </blockquote> <p>The Treasury have also been briefing about the speech and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-deal-welfare-cuts\">you can read Patrick Wintour's preview story for the Guardian here.</a></p> <p>Osborne has been giving interviews this morning and he is about to go on the Today programme. I will be covering that in detail.</p> <p>It's also a big day for Boris Johnson. His main conference speech is tomorrow, but he's addressing a rally this evening at 6pm and, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9593203/London-has-turned-its-back-on-the-very-people-it-needs-most.html\">in an article in the Daily Telegraph this morning,</a> he's declared that the Conservatives need to do more to champion the \"struggling middle\". Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not doing as the Victorians did, and providing new stock to be bought by the people in the middle \u2013 on household incomes from \u00a330,000 to \u00a364,000; and they are feeling utterly and understandably ignored. They cannot get the mortgages they would need, not at current prices, and not with lenders in their current mood. They have to live at a great distance from their place of work, and spend huge quantities on travel and hardly get to see their children in the evenings. They are obliged to rent at ever higher prices. In the past 10 years, the number of rented households in London has doubled, and rents went up 12 per cent last year alone.</p> <p>The overwhelming majority of such people would like to buy, and to get on the same magic property escalator that has boosted the Milibands. It is time to help them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's the full agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9am:</em> The United Kingdom in Action, with speeches from Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, David Jones, the Welsh secretary, Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, David Mundell, the Scotland Office minister, and Andrew Davies, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> The economy, with speeches from Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, Michael Fallon, the business minister and George Osborne.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Turning Communities Around, with speeches from Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, and Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary.</p> <p>6pm: Boris Johnson's rally, entitled, \"Re-elected and Olympotastic.\"</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>A few years ago, when the CfBT Education Trust, a non-profit organisation that runs schools and education services, was looking to expand its operations in Malaysia, its chief executive, Neil McIntosh, arranged a meeting with the local high commissioner. When he got there, though, he was disappointed to see that the commissioner had brought along a representative of one of CfBT's main competitors. \"He was a bit put out that I should see the British Council in that light,\" says McIntosh.</p> <p>The British Council, it's widely thought, is a thoroughly good thing. It is the epitome of soft power, a long-established arm of the Foreign Office that promotes British interests not with bombs and guns, but through culture and education. A big part of its job is to promote UK education: by marketing domestic universities to international students, or providing local intelligence to any education provider that wants to work overseas. Officials often suggest the council's local office should be first port of call for any company looking to enter a new market.</p> <p>Consequently, McIntosh admits, criticising it feels a little bit like \"crying foul on someone's much-loved grandmother\". But the British Council isn't just a charity. It is also an increasingly ambitious player in the global market for English language teaching, exam provision and other education services. It holds a one-third share in the International English Language Testing System, for example, and takes on contracts to train teachers for overseas governments.</p> <p>Now questions are being asked about whether such activities conflict with the council's role in supporting other providers, like CfBT. Says McIntosh: \"It makes it more difficult for us to compete with America and Australia, whose diplomatic missions represent their education systems more comprehensively.\"</p> <p>McIntosh is not alone in his views. \"Every company I know has concerns about the British Council,\" says Patrick Watson, managing director of Montrose Public Affairs, which works with a number of firms. \"It uses its monopoly position aggressively: if you don't play ball, it can simply ignore you or decide to collaborate with someone else.\"</p> <p>One business leader even says: \"The British Council doesn't really enable British education exports: it inhibits them.\"</p> <p>The council itself rejects such criticism robustly. Dr Jo Beall, its director of education, points to all the work it does to promote British education: enabling academic partnerships with India and Brazil; telling the world that UK universities are open for business. \"It's because the British Council has been flying the UK flag for nearly 80 years that there's such a strong market in the first place,\" she says.</p> <p>The root of the row lies in the council's unusual funding model. It is a quango, sponsored by the Foreign Office, that exists to promote British education and culture. That, in ministers' minds, includes supporting private education firms seeking export opportunities.</p> <p>But as its grant has been cut, the organisation has had to shore up its finances by selling its own education services: English language teaching, teacher training, and providing exams. Overseas governments seeking a bit of British educational expertise often appeal to the British Council for help. In some cases, it steps in to provide that help itself, and rivals complain there are no clear criteria explaining which contracts it will pass to the industry and which it will hang on to. \"Human nature being what it is,\" says Andrew Fitzmaurice, chief executive of international schools firm Nord Anglia, \"I suspect they're always going to keep the best ones.\"</p> <p>The upshot of all this is that the British Council sometimes promotes others and sometimes promotes itself. Many companies are wary of asking for its support, either because they are reluctant to share information with a competitor, or because they think the council would be unwilling to help. \"I never gave the British Council a moment's consideration as a source of information and support,\" says Kevin McNeany, chair of Orbital Education, who has worked in the sector for more than 40&#xa0;years. \"Even if they had information of commercial value, it would first be filtered through its own internal networks to see if it could be monetised for in-house benefit.\"</p> <p>The critics have other complaints, too. The British Council's not-for-profit status means it is exempt from corporation tax in many countries, so in some cases can undercut competitors. And in some regions it also works closely with the British embassy. \"I am never going to get a meeting with the ambassador at short notice,\" says one angry executive. \"For the British Council, it's just a short walk along the corridor.\"</p> <p>Actually, British Council spokespeople point out, it co-locates with the Foreign Office in fewer than a quarter of the countries where it works, and it does so only for reasons of security or cost. And they say there are protocols in place to stop the council's commercial and charitable arms from sharing information. Its tax advantages, they point out, merely reflect the fact that it doesn't make a profit, but uses all income to support its work promoting Britain abroad. Its chief executive, Martin Davidson, is very proud of all this, describing the set-up as \"a model of entrepreneurial public service\".</p> <p>Another complaint, though, is that the council's commercial goals could affect its advice. Its <a href=\"http://www.educationuk.org/\" title=\"\">Education UK</a> website is intended to be the front first port of call for international students looking to study in the UK. But the most visible listings are those schools and colleges that have paid for the privilege: potential students are less likely to discover the course best for them, more likely to see the one with the biggest marketing budget. \"Institutions are welcome to pay for extra promotional services,\" Beall admits. But she rejects any suggestion that this means the site is biased towards certain institutions, and points out that the council makes no money from the website.</p> <p>\"The problem is not created by the British Council itself,\" says McIntosh. \"It's created by the government, which requires the council to fund itself by competing with the organisations that it's supposed to represent. That is not a sustainable position.\"</p> <p>Beall, though, rejects this entirely. \"I really resent that idea that we should move out of this [commercial] space,\" she says. \"It's tantamount to a private university saying that all public universities should vacate the market.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>The government does not seem convinced of the case for reform. In 2010, a group of education bosses led by McIntosh wrote to Francis Maude, cabinet secretary, about the British Council's operations (as well as other quangos), requesting he take action. Maude promised no remedy. A delegation that met the trade minister Lord Green over the summer report a distinct lack of concern. Whatever the gripes of education businesses, the British Council is here to stay.</p>",

  "<p>A man who defaced a work by Mark Rothko at Tate Modern in London on Sunday <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/08/defaced-tate-modern-rothko\">has claimed that by doing so he has improved the value of the painting</a>. </p> <p>Vladimir Umanets (or the person identifying himself as Umanets) claimed that he had acted in the spirit of Marcel Duchamp, who in 1917 signed a urinal \"R.Mutt\", gave it a title \u2013 Fountain \u2013 and submitted it for exhibition under the auspices of the American Society of Independent Artists. It was rejected \u2013&#xa0;but with Fountain, Duchamp pretty much invented conceptual art.</p> <p>In the satirical or conceptual spirit of Duchamp, then \u2013 it being rather less advisable to act in the more demonstrative spirit of Mr Umanets, given Scotland Yard's efforts to find him \u2013 here are five more art works that could be improved \u2026 and how to improve them.</p> <h2>1. Tracey Emin: My Bed (1998)</h2> <p>Emin, famously, made the Turner Prize shortlist with her unmade bed, which was strewn with the detritus of an unhappy life \u2013 including, as the <a href=\"http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/artpages/tracey_emin_my_bed.htm\">Saatchi Gallery website</a> says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 empty booze bottles, fag butts, stained sheets, worn panties: the bloody aftermath of a nervous breakdown.</p> </blockquote> <p>The piece attracted protests, inevitably: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/1999/oct/25/20yearsoftheturnerprize.turnerprize\">two Chinese artists stripped to the waist and bounced about on the bed for 15 minutes</a>, indulging in a pillow fight while they were at it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397401961\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/12/30/1293726273089/My-Bed-by-Tracey-Emin-199-007.jpg\" alt=\"My Bed, by Tracey Emin, 1998\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">My Bed, by Tracey Emin, which failed to win the artist the 1999 Turner prize. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clearly the best way to improve Emin's unmade bed would be simply to steal into its gallery in the middle of the night and make it \u2013 crisp counterpane, fluffed pillows, a bit of a vacuum of the carpet. All of which would obviously be a devastating comment about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/culture-cuts-blog/2011/may/16/art-emin\">Emin's professed support for the</a> Conservative party.</p> <h2>2. Martin Creed: Work No 227, The Lights Going On And Off (2000)</h2> <p>Creed's Turner Prize winner offers a bare gallery that is illuminated, and then not, by a light that switches itself on and off every five seconds. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=101549\">MoMA</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This piece is based on a cycle of repetitive contradictions: each five-second phase is denied by the next.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which is all well and good. It is incumbent upon this writer, however, to suggest simply switching the light off, thereby setting a fine example in the fight to conserve energy and slow down global warming, the melting of the icecaps and other looming nasties otherwise encouraged by such wanton profligacy. That, or just make sure he's using a low-energy bulb. </p> <h2>3. Lucio Fontana, Spacial Concept Waiting (1960)</h2> <p>Lest one be accused of willful philistinism \u2013 the best kind, admittedly \u2013 it is necessary next to a) proffer approval of Jake and Dinos Chapman's habit of improving or \"rectifying\" prints of works by Goya (<em>not</em> original pieces) and making interesting points about art and war and vandalism and so on, all <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/mar/31/arts.turnerprize2003\">by the addition of clown faces</a> and b) suggest a similar improvement to works by Lucio Fontana, the founder of Spatialism.</p> <p>Fontana's Tagli (\"Cuts\") are canvases of various colours cut, jabbed and slashed in various ways to produce unsettling and thought-provoking effects. But even given the provocation of some prime art-historical gibberish \u2013 the cuts are, Tate tells us, \"emblematic of his gestural aesthetic\" \u2013 to suggest simply improving Fontana's work with a needle and thread would be lazy. </p> <p>Instead, one might consider some Chapman-esque work \u2013 a baleful pair of eyes and a horn or two, perhaps borrowed from Hieronymus Bosch's more apocalyptic stuff or <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/bartolome-bermejo-saint-michael-triumphs-over-the-devil\">Bartolom\u00e9 Bermejo's little Satan</a> and added to the canvas with appropriate care, might make Fontana's cuts more unsettling still.</p> <p>Fontana, by the way, was of the opinion that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My discovery was the hole and that's it. I am happy to go to the grave after such a discovery.</p> </blockquote> <p>Which seems fair enough.</p> <h2>4. Raphael, The Madonna of the Pinks (1506-07)</h2> <p>Some artworks could be improved simply by being found \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/mar/18/leonardo-mystery-florence-art-detectives\">Leonardo Da Vinci's long-lost Battle of Anghiari fresco, for an example well documented here</a>. Others might be improved simply by not being found <em>out</em>.</p> <p>This tiny Raphael hangs in the National Gallery in London and is undeniably exquisite and thus unimprovable. Its inclusion here is due to a 2004 appeal that raised \u00a322m, including \u00a311.5m of lottery money, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/feb/14/arts.artsnews?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">in order to persuade the Duke of Northumberland not to sell it to the Getty museum in Los Angeles</a>. </p> <p>Intriguingly, the National Gallery's website says that \"for more than a century it was thought to be only a copy\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397401962\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2009/1/22/1232625012612/Raphaels-Madonna-of-the-P-001.jpg\" alt=\"Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Worthy of awe' \u2026 A detail from Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks. Photograph: Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don't doubt the scholarship that went into the realisation that The Madonna of the Pinks was a genuine Raphael. But attribution, particularly regarding old-master paintings, is a curious business (there are plenty of rather contentious Rembrandts) and about as difficult as it should be to justify paying vast sums public money to an aristocrat in order to \"save for the nation\" a painting, however marvelous, that most of the nation will never see. Or want to. </p> <p>Some paintings might be improved by not being proved to be <em>great</em> paintings and thus not being \"saved for the nation\".</p> <h2>5. Anish Kapoor, ArcelorMittal Orbit (2012)</h2> <p>And finally: <a href=\"http://www.arcelormittalorbit.com/\">Kapoor's enormous public sculpture in the London Olympic park</a> has attracted its fair share of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/may/11/orbit-tower-drunken-party-animal\">criticism, conversation and controversy</a> and I don't propose to add to all that here by suggesting improvement by demolition. </p> <p>Rather, the thing just has to be made into a helter-skelter, hasn't it?</p>",
  "<p>BP is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/19/bp-close-sale-texas-city-refinery\" title=\"\">close to reaching its $38bn disposals target</a> after selling its Texas City refinery, where 15 people died and 170 were injured in an explosion in 2005, to Marathon Petroleum for $2.5bn (\u00a31.55bn).</p> <p>The sale brings to an end a sorry chapter in BP's history: it had to pay $13m in July to settle 409 safety violations found by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration following the disaster, which was the worst industrial accident in the US for a generation. It happened when workers overfilled a container with volatile chemicals, sparking an explosion.</p> <p>The settlement removed a major hurdle for the disposal of the refinery, which turns 475,000 barrels of oil a day into petrol and jet fuel. Two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/12/bp-texas-city-explosion-fine\" title=\"\">BP was fined a record $50.6m</a> for failing to fix hazards at the site south-east of Houston, Texas, and agreed to spend at least $500m on safety improvements. BP said it paid out well over $2bn in civil claims, fines and penalties relating to the 2005 explosion.</p> <p>Texas City refinery manager Keith Casey said the site had been transformed through an increased focus on safety and in recent months returned to profitability. \"It does not, however, fit with the long-term strategic direction of BP's global refining portfolio,\" he said.</p> <p>The sale price is made up of $600m in cash, $1.2bn for inventories and $700m that Marathon will pay BP over the next six years in an \"earn-out\" arrangement based on the refinery's future operation and margins.</p> <p>The 2,200 people working at Texas City are expected to transfer to the new owner, a \"downstream\" company (ie involved in selling and distributing natural gas and crude oil products) which already has a small refinery in Texas City.</p> <p>BP initially embarked on a $23bn selling spree to raise cash for liabilities and fines after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, then last year it raised the target amount it wanted to raise from selling \"non-core\" assets to $38bn.</p> <p>The sale of the Texas City refinery, which also includes liquified natural gas pipelines and four marketing terminals in the south-east US, comes after the recent offloading of BP's Carson refinery in California and brings the total disposals to $35bn.</p> <p>BP has been keen to scale down its refining operations, where profit margins are thin. The company is confident of reaching its $38bn target by the end of next year, although it has not hoisted the \"for sale\" sign over any other assets.</p> <p>BP took a $38bn charge related to the Gulf of Mexico disaster. So far it has spent $14bn cleaning up the oil spill; paid out more than $8bn in claims; and agreed a <a href=\"http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=2012968&amp;contentId=7073667\" title=\"\">settlement with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee</a> \u2013 which represents affected individuals and small businesses \u2013 which is expected to cost the company another $8bn.</p> <p>The US department of justice has said it expects to find BP guilty of gross negligence in a court case which restarts in January. If the government can prove gross negligence it can triple the damages BP may have to pay to $21bn.</p> <p>\"Today's announcement is the second major milestone in the strategic refocusing of our US fuels business,\" said Iain Conn, chief executive of BP's global refining and marketing business. \"Together with the sale of our Carson, California refinery, announced in August, the divestment of Texas City will allow us to focus BP's US fuels investments on our three northern refineries.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/13/bp-sells-californian-refinery-carson\" title=\"\">energy giant sold its Carson refinery</a> to Tesoro for $2.5bn but is investing heavily in three core US sites: Whiting in Indiana, Cherry Point in Washington and Toledo in Ohio.

  "<p>Industrial groups were hit hard by a profit warning from <strong>Cookson</strong>, which blamed its woes on weak production in the global steel industry.</p> <p>Cookson closed 76p lower at 539p - a 12% decline - after it said the trading performance in its engineered ceramics division in the third quarter, and the last month in particular, had been weaker than expected. The division supplies products and systems to the steel industry, which accounts for around half its revenue, and has been hit by falls in steel production. According to industry statistics production fell by 3% in July and August excluding China, and 1% for the world as a whole. September has seen further weakening, rather than the usual upturn after the summer lull:</p> <blockquote> News flow from the ultimate end-markets, such as heavy truck, higher-end automotive, wind turbines, and construction, mining and agricultural equipment, is indicating a further general slowdown in production levels that started to become evident towards the end of the second quarter. <br> </blockquote> <p>The division's solar business also continued to be depressed, the company said, and it has taken action to cut costs including closing one of its two Chinese factories, resulting in a \u00a316m write-off and \u00a31m of restructuring costs.</p> <p>Cookson said if the situation continued, the performance of its ceramic division in the second half would be below expectations and lower than the first six months:</p> <blockquote> As a result, full year performance for the group as a whole is now expected to be materially below the board's previous expectations. </blockquote> <p>The company said plans for its proposed demerger were progressing well and it expected to give a further update before the end of the year. Michael Blogg at Investec said he expected earnings estimates to fall by 10% to 15% after the news.</p> <p>Other industrial groups also suffered. <strong>Morgan Crucible Company</strong>, which also makes industrial ceramics, was down 21.7p at 257.8p while <strong>Bodycote International</strong> fell 20.1p to 391p and <strong>IMI</strong> dropped 23p to 948p. <strong>GKN</strong>, the automotive and aerospace specialist, was hit by Cookson's remarks about the sectors where it is involved, losing 9.4p to 216.9p. Harry Philips at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> The immediate read across is Morgan Crucible given its solar related/renewables in China. Elsewhere, IMI and Bodycote on the truck reference but we have spent a great deal of time with Bodycote ahead of our initiation last week and IMI was in robust form on Thursday at the capital markets day. </blockquote> <p>With the weakness in the steel industry highlighted by Cookson's figures, Russian steel producer <strong>Evraz</strong>, controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, dropped 9.4p to 244.7p.</p> <p>Commodity companies in general were undermined by the World Bank warning of a continuing slowdown in China, a key market these days. So <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> lost 33p to \u00a310.68 and <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> was 7.6p lower at 325.7p.</p> <p>All that helped push the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> down 29.28 points to 5841.74. Investors were also nervous as European finance ministers met to thrash out the latest plans to tackle the eurozone crisis. There was no guidance from Wall Street, which was closed for the Columbus Day holiday. On Tuesday the US reporting season begins with Alcoa, and analysts believe the global slowdown will be reflected in the latest company reports.</p> <p><strong>Aquarius Platinum</strong> fell 4.75p to 42.75p after chief executive Stuart Murray left the mining group after ten years amid continuing unrest in South Africa. No reason was given for his departure. The company has been struggling with falling platinum prices recently but a growing concern is the strikes for higher wages which are spreading across the industry, with the unrest leading to almost 50 people losing their lives.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Xstrata</strong>, still in the throes of attempting a merger with commodities group Glencore, lost 3.3p to 950.2p after the company confirmed workers at its Eland platinum mine had gone on strike on Friday.</p> <p>Worries about the situation in South Africa have also hit insurer <strong>Old Mutual</strong>, down 2.9p to 169.5p on concerns about its operations in the country.</p> <p>Recruitment group <strong>Michael Page International</strong> dipped 2.1p to 363p after its second profit warning in less than a year. The company said third quarter profits fell 8% compared to the previous three months and 11% on the same period last year, so full year operating profits would be slightly below current City expectations</p> <p><strong>FirstGroup</strong> continued to fall in the wake of last week's decision to remove the West Coast rail franchise from the company, down 5.3p to 190.8p. Analysts at Liberum Capital said FirstGroup's balance sheet could be hit by the move, and it might need a cash call of around \u00a3400m.</p> <p>Liberum's Peter Hyde said:</p> <blockquote> Clearly investment is not for the faint hearted. However, at the current share price, and even assuming a \u00a3400 rights issue, we see possible upside. </blockquote> <p><strong>Ocado</strong> lost 3.1p to 65.6p in the wake of weekend reports that <strong>Morrisons</strong>, up 5.7p to 283.9p, planned to launch on online food service next year.</p> <p><strong>Halfords</strong> accelerated 12p to 314.6p as analysts at HSBC raised their target price on the retailer from 215p to 330p in the wake of last week's better than expected results. They lifted their pretax profit estimates for 2013-2015 by 8%-12% but kept their neutral rating after the group's recent strong share price performance.</p> <p>A broker upgrade also lifted data centre operator <strong>Telecity</strong> by 18p to 957p. Berenberg said:</p> <blockquote> We are raising Telecity's price target from 960p to \u00a311 and maintain our buy recommendation. Telecity is one of the highest-quality names in our coverage. It has a near monopoly position due to the eco-system it has created inside its data centres, which leads to less than 5% churn and greater than 90% recurring revenues. </blockquote> <p>Finally UK snack maker<strong> Zetar</strong> jumped 23% to 291p. After the market closed on Friday the company announced it had accepted a \u00a343m, 297p a share offer from German food group Zertus.</p>",
  "<p><em>The following remarks were prepared for delivery:</em></p> <p>\"I particularly appreciate the introduction from my good friend and tireless campaign companion, Gov. Bob McDonnell. He is showing what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy. Thank you also Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. And particular thanks to Gen. Peay. I appreciate your invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute. It is a great privilege to be here at an Institution that has done so much for our nation, both in war and in peace.<br> For more than 170 years, VMI has done more than educate students. It has guided their transformation into citizens, and warriors, and leaders. VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and other lands. Since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates and all Americans who are now serving in harm's way. May God bless all who serve, and all who have served. Of all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished than George Marshall\u2014the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war. General Marshall once said, \"The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it.\" Those words were true in his time\u2014and they still echo in ours. Last month, our nation was attacked again. A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead\u2014murdered in Benghazi, Libya. Among the dead were three veterans. All of them were fine men, on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that dearly longs for both. President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America. And he is right. We all mourn their loss. The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident. They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia. Our embassies have been attacked. Our flag has been burned. Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting \"Death to America.\" These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. As the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown so much worse, and what this calls on America to do. These are the right questions. And I have come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events\u2014and to share with you, and all Americans, my vision for a freer, more prosperous, and more peaceful world.  The attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts. They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East\u2014a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century. And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself. The attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.  We saw all of this in Benghazi last month\u2014but we also saw something else, something hopeful. After the attack on our Consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who murdered our people. They waved signs that read, \"The Ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya is sorry.\" They chanted \"No to militias.\" They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound. Then they burned it to the ground. As one Libyan woman said, \"We are not going to go from darkness to darkness.\" This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation. It is the struggle of millions and millions of people\u2014men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and non-believers\u2014all of whom have had enough of the darkness. It is a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom, and opportunity, and the right to live under laws of our own making. It is a struggle that has unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Libya, and now Syria. In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair. We have seen this struggle before. It would be familiar to George Marshall. In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism. Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values, and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts. Statesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world. We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets. We defended our friends, and ourselves, from our common enemies. We led. And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century. This is what makes America exceptional: It is not just the character of our country\u2014it is the record of our accomplishments. America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership\u2014a history that has been written by patriots of both parties. That is America at its best. And it is the standard by which we measure every President, as well as anyone who wishes to be President. Unfortunately, this President's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership. And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.  I want to be very clear: The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out\u2014no one else. But it is the responsibility of our President to use America's great power to shape history\u2014not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events. Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama. The relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put \"daylight\" between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded. This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran. Iran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability. It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and to us. And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation's capital. And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, \"Are you with us, or are you with them?\"\u2014the American President was silent. Across the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces, and growing economies, and developing democratic institutions, the President has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need.  In Iraq, the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent Al-Qaeda, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad, and the rising influence of Iran. And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried\u2014and failed\u2014to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains. The President has failed to lead in Syria, where more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight. Our ally Turkey has been attacked. And the conflict threatens stability in the region. America can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. These are real achievements won at a high cost. But Al-Qaeda remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region. Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East. The President is fond of saying that \"The tide of war is receding.\" And I want to believe him as much as anyone. But when we look at the Middle East today\u2014with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threating to destabilize the region, with violent extremists on the march, and with an American Ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of Al-Qaeda affiliates\u2014 it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the President took office. I know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope. But hope is not a strategy. We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.  The greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East\u2014friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us. Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our President is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, \"We will not forget that you forgot about us.\" It is time to change course in the Middle East. That course should be organized around these bedrock principles: America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them\u2026 no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them\u2026 and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words. I will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region\u2014and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions\u2014not just words\u2014that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated. I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security\u2014the world must never see any daylight between our two nations. I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf. And I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure. The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow. The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war. The size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916. I will restore our Navy to the size needed to fulfill our missions by building 15 ships per year, including three submarines. I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. And on this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. And I will call on our NATO allies to keep the greatest military alliance in history strong by honoring their commitment to each devote 2 percent of their GDP to security spending. Today, only 3 of the 28 NATO nations meet this benchmark. I will make further reforms to our foreign assistance to create incentives for good governance, free enterprise, and greater trade, in the Middle East and beyond. I will organize all assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with responsibility and accountability to prioritize efforts and produce results. I will rally our friends and allies to match our generosity with theirs. And I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that, in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government\u2014to respect the rights of all of their citizens, including women and minorities\u2026 to ensure space for civil society, a free media, political parties, and an independent judiciary\u2026 and to abide by their international commitments to protect our diplomats and our property. I will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world. The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years. I will reverse that failure. I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones. I will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies. In Libya, I will support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.  In Egypt, I will use our influence\u2014including clear conditions on our aid\u2014to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid. In Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them. We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran\u2014rather than sitting on the sidelines. It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.  And in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014. President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war \u2013 and to potential attacks here at home \u2013 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11. I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation. Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew. There is a longing for American leadership in the Middle East\u2014and it is not unique to that region. It is broadly felt by America's friends and allies in other parts of the world as well\u2014 in Europe, where Putin's Russia casts a long shadow over young democracies, and where our oldest allies have been told we are \"pivoting\" away from them \u2026 in Asia and across the Pacific, where China's recent assertiveness is sending chills through the region \u2026 and here in our own hemisphere, where our neighbors in Latin America want to resist the failed ideology of Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers and deepen ties with the United States on trade, energy, and security. But in all of these places, just as in the Middle East, the question is asked: \"Where does America stand?\" I know many Americans are asking a different question: \"Why us?\" I know many Americans are asking whether our country today\u2014with our ailing economy, and our massive debt, and after 11 years at war\u2014is still capable of leading.  I believe that if America does not lead, others will\u2014others who do not share our interests and our values\u2014and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us. America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years. I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America's great influence\u2014wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively\u2014to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better\u2014not perfect, but better.  Our friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership. They want more\u2014more of our moral support, more of our security cooperation, more of our trade, and more of our assistance in building free societies and thriving economies. So many people across the world still look to America as the best hope of humankind. So many people still have faith in America. We must show them that we still have faith in ourselves\u2014that we have the will and the wisdom to revive our stagnant economy, to roll back our unsustainable debt, to reform our government, to reverse the catastrophic cuts now threatening our national defense, to renew the sources of our great power, and to lead the course of human events. Sir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall: \"He \u2026 always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion.\" That is the role our friends want America to play again. And it is the role we must play.  The 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  The torch America carries is one of decency and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty \u2013 and honor \u2013 to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\"</p>",

  "<p>Sports giant Puma will next year unveil a coalition of companies that are prepared to develop ground-breaking work on creating an environmental profit and loss account (EP&amp;L).</p> <p>The news comes as Puma chairman, Jochen Zeitz, announced that the company has for the first time taken its EP&amp;L down to a product level, which will demonstrate to consumers what products are more sustainable by putting a price tag against the environmental damage they do.</p> <p>Zeitz said he was sharing the knowledge the company had gained in order to scale up change.</p> <p>\"We want to expand our learnings and tools to simplify the methodology and gradually roll out more products that are covered by the EP&amp;L,\" he said. \"We are willing to share the knowledge to get this to the next level.</p> <p>\"We will be working with other organisations and I will be taking on that challenge to get some positive momentum.

In 2013, we will be able to announce we have around a dozen companies that will be pretty representative of sectors and impacts.\"</p> <p>The latest iteration of Puma's EP&amp;L is to compare a soon to be launched biodegradeable sports shoe and T-shirt, against its more conventional equivalents.</p> <p>By measuring the impacts from cradle to cradle, the company has been able to establish that developing more sustainable products is in fact making a positive difference.</p> <p>What the company found, for example, is that the environmental impact of its new InCycle shoe is nearly a third less than its conventional suede shoe and equivalent to \u20ac2.95, or 3% of the retail price.</p> <p>The environmental cost of T-shirts is much higher; 17% of the retail value for traditional cotton, compared with 12% for the biodegradeable version.</p> <p>However, much of that benefit would be lost if the biodegradable shoes and T-shirts at the end of their life ended up in landfill or were incinerated.</p> <p>Zeitz said: \"By showing environmental costs in euros and cents, our new Puma product EP&amp;L visualises the environmental impacts Puma products cause and makes comparing products in terms of sustainability easy for everyone. It therefore serves as a powerful assessment tool for comparing the sustainability of different products.</p> <p>\"As the calorie and nutrition information table on your cereal box helps you compare the dietary impacts of one breakfast choice to another, our new Puma product EP&amp;L helps you to judge whether one shoe or shirt is more environmentally friendly, but also to engage our customers and help them make better and more sustainable choices.</p> <p>But will consumers actually be bothered by price tags showing the environmental cost of their goods, if it does not actually affect the price they pay for the products?</p> <p>Zeitz believes it will have an impact. \"Many of our customers do care about the environment but they may be confused by lots of labels, but this will change once we have standardised the calculation and put a tag on every product.\"</p> <p>By looking at every aspect of a product's life, from the sourcing of raw materials and their manufacture, to their use and disposal, Zeitz says environmental benefits will now be much more transparent and quantifiable, and that certain myths will be able to be debunked.</p> <p>For example, companies using leather often trumpet the fact that they use less water in its manufacture then synthetic fibres. But Zeitz says that when you look across the board, it is clear that leather production is a lot more damaging overall.</p> <p>Zeitz also criticised governments for perverse subsidies that make it more expensive to use more sustainable materials, pointing out that if the company switched its suede shoes from leather to more sustainable materials, it would cost an extra \u20ac3.4 million a year in duties.</p> <p>\"I call upon governments to start supporting companies to use more sustainable materials in their products instead of continuing with antiquated incentives, such as import duties on synthetic materials that are in principle much higher compared with those placed on leather goods regardless of the environmental footprint,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Governments have a unique opportunity to incentivise corporations so that they can accelerate their evolution to a more sustainable economy through more sustainable practices and products.\"</p> <p>Zeitz admitted this would be a difficult task because the leather industry would fight such changes, and is therefore going to work with other companies and interested NGOs to try to put pressure on regulators.</p> <p>\"There is a huge opportunity, now that we have visibility on our true impacts, to change incentives. There are bodies out there that will help and support us. A lot of industry is very traditional in their thinking and there are lobbyists out there who do not want to see change.</p> <p>\"I will be involved in seeking to take this beyond one company and try to start scaling the impact by working with other business leaders to stop damaging subsidies.</p> <p>\"We will start positive lobbying. We are open to anyone who is ready to work in a constructive way. This needs to happen with business, as the private sector has a responsibility and we should take that seriously.\"</p> <p>The enormous support for the company's EP&amp;L has taken Zeitz by surprise. While the company only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/puma-completes-environmental-profit-and-loss?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">launched its initiative last November</a>, it has been a talking point around the world, including at this year's Rio +20 conference.</p> <p>\"I am very pleased and feeling positive,\" says Zeitz. \"I always saw the huge potential and have received an incredibly positive response. There is nobody that I have heard that says this is nonsense.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Shale gas is the great hope of George Osborne and his fellow Conservatives who detest what they see in the renewable energy sector: subsidy junkies and woolly minded greens. But in a brief section of <a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/George_Osborne.aspx\" title=\"\">his speech to his party conference on Monday</a>, he managed to give comfort to both. \"An enterprise strategy means investing in renewable energy,\" he said, a far warmer phrase than in previous speeches and presumably wrung out of him by the Lib Dems. But then he completed the sentence: \"... and opening up the newly discovered shale gas reserves beneath our land.\"</p> <p>\"We are today consulting on a generous new tax regime for shale so that Britain is not left behind as gas prices tumble on the other side of the Atlantic,\" said Osborne. It's certainly true that the shale gas industry in the UK needs all the help it can get, having drilled only a handful of wells, far short of the hundreds or thousands needed to really know how much gas could be released by fracking. Furthermore, the CBI and Deutsche Bank among others <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/nov/03/shale-gas-game-changer-fracking\" title=\"\">have said there can be no repetition of the US gas miracle</a>, given differences in mineral rights, population density and environmental regulations.</p> <p>The Lib Dem energy and climate change secretary, Ed Davey, illustrated the tension with the chancellor by giving <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/gastech_ed/gastech_ed.aspx\" title=\"\">a speech on gas on Monday,</a> in which he said: \"I know that industry analysts do see shale as a rather different proposition here than in the US. Questions about regulatory oversight and the involvement of local communities need to be answered rather than simply dismissed. And, of course, the deployment of any new energy source must be consistent with our carbon plan and carbon budgets.\"</p> <p>The government's dilemma on gas, courting investors for a 50% increase in the number of gas-fired power stations on the grid while insisting that carbon reduction targets can still be met, was neatly illustrated by Ed Davey's morning. After delivering a speech at the <a href=\"http://www.gastech.co.uk/conference/\" title=\"\">Gastech conference</a> in east London, in which he promised a golden future for gas-fired power generation in the UK as many as 20 new power stations to be built, he was whisked across the river <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/EUClimateAction\" title=\"\">to City Hall to extol the government's climate change policy</a>, which he said included tougher carbon reduction targets for the EU.</p> <p>It left his audience wondering how the two \u2013 a massive expansion of fossil-fuelled power while cutting greenhouse gases \u2013 could be compatible.</p> <p>Connie Hedegaard, the European commissioner for climate change, who shared his platform at the second event, said: \"Gas can be part of the solution, but it definitely can't be the whole solution. It's clear that with renewable energy you get a much more longer term and sustainable solution. That's why we need CO2 targets and renewable targets.\"</p> <p>The UK opposes setting a European renewable energy target beyond 2020, when the current one expires.</p> <p>The reaction to Osborne's announcement ranged from lukewarm praise to fiery opposition. One government source said: \"It will make no difference to the pace of the decision [on whether shale gas gets the go-ahead]. But its not totally ridiculous as preparation for the decision.\"</p> <p>Some sections of the energy industry were unimpressed. Volker Beckers, chief executive of RWE npower, one of the UK's big six energy company, told me: \"There will be very little volumes of shale gas in the UK. We have more major [energy] problems to solve.\"</p> <p>Laura Sandys, Conservative MP and part of the ministerial team at the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc), highlighted the problem of public opposition shale gas is likely to face: \"Onshore wind is a walk in the park, by comparison.\"</p> <p>Mild praise came from CBI director-general, John Cridland, who said: \"It makes sense to maximise the amount of energy we can produce at home at reasonable cost. [This] sits alongside investment in renewables. I don't want all my eggs in one energy basket.\"</p> <p>But Friends of the Earth's Craig Bennett said: \"The chancellor clearly isn't listening to the increasingly vociferous warnings from leading politicians, businesses and climate experts about his reckless dash for gas. With a fossil-fuelled economic strategy firmly rooted in the 1970s, George Osborne is looking increasingly incapable of dealing with the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>Campaigners also doubted that the government could square the circle of more gas while cutting carbon drastically overall. WWF-UK pointed to a set of scenarios it commisioned last year showing that to decarbonise the electricity sector by 2030, as Mr Davey has proposed, gas plants would only be able to run infrequently as back up to renewables. That is unlikely to appeal to investors, who expect to receive a return for the 25 year life of their power stations.</p> <p>The consultation on shale gas will not be a formal one, but rather an \"engagement with industry\". A statement from the Treasury said: \"With the shale gas industry at an early stage of development, the government believes that a targeted tax regime will help unlock investment. The use of field allowances to encourage investment in the North Sea has demonstrated the effectiveness of a targeted tax regime in stimulating investment and production that would not otherwise have gone ahead. The government will engage with companies to ensure that the final structure of the regime is appropriately targeted while maintaining a fair return for the exchequer.\"</p> <p>Osborne's speech also comes against the background of two key letters today. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/firms-tories-2030-carbon-target\" title=\"\">One from companies including Asda, Microsoft and EDF</a> calling for a 2030 target for carbon emissions from power stations, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3561457.ece\" title=\"\">and a second from nuclear and wind energy companies</a> including Areva, Siemens and Vestas calling on the government to firm up its green commitment or lose hundreds of millions of pounds of investment.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago I kicked off my new iGCSE physics course by handing out the syllabus and asking two questions: \"What do you know already?\" followed shortly afterward by \"OK, so where shall we start?\" After some group discussion we mapped out a rough path through the headline topics, formed some teams and got started.</p> <p>Fast forward to this week when I received an email from Taran, now in year 11. He attached a spreadsheet with a timeline showing all the lessons between now and the exam in June. He mapped across all the topic areas we still haven't covered suggesting a sequence for the lessons, leaving time for consolidation, tests and revision. It's a masterpiece. I've asked him to run it by some of the others but it will certainly form the backbone of our planning. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Henry and Sean have taken the books in for marking this weekend. I met them in my office for 10 minutes before school to discuss the process and I'm confident next lesson they'll be handing the books back with good feedback for everyone \u2013 not just a simple tick/cross checking of answers. They'll have some time to go over the common difficulties and pitfalls with series and parallel circuits with the whole class and make sure everyone does their corrections and acts on the feedback.</p> <p>Looking ahead, Max and Anujan are starting to plan their unit on motors and generators. There is a fair bit of theory but also some good demos and class practicals that they will be able to get their teeth into. Making motors is one of the most amazing things you can do in a physics lab, but even better if you get the chance to lead your peers through the experience and help them to learn the concepts.</p> <p>This is all part of the co-construction process I am exploring along with some colleagues. For me, it is a fabulously rewarding way to teach and the students enjoy it too - especially when they are in the driving seat. So far we've been testing the approach in RE, physics and in our global perspectives pre-U course but teachers in English and PE are now giving it a go. The principle is this: the whole class is involved in planning and delivering the course. They work with the teacher to plan the content, to agree the sequence of lessons, to deliver whole or part lessons, to set and mark homework and to design assessments. </p> <p>The outcomes are amazing. Empowered with this level of responsibility, students come up with great ideas for lessons, discover or produce superb resources and demonstrate real authority in leading class discussions. We've refined the process along the way (as described in our Learning Lessons publications and on my <a href=\"http://headguruteacher.com/\">blog</a>) and it can be a bit of a white-knuckle ride at times because you never know exactly what you are going to get. However, when a pair of year 7 boys is asking their peers to \"think, pair, share\" in discussing the relevance of the five pillars of Islam in modern Britain or they are setting homework via the website they made themselves co-construction seems like the very best way to teach and to learn. When conservation of momentum or the lens equation are being brought to life by a group of year 10s and they are able to support their peers in setting up the apparatus for the experiment, the whole process comes into its own. </p> <p>We've found that it pays to invest time in doing a bit of teacher training. They learn quickly that putting hands up doesn't work and word-searches are really boring. Similarly, they find that there is a lot more to teaching than making a PowerPoint. The early planning stage is important but you need to be prepared to adapt and change course with regular stock take. The aim is to engender a deeper understanding of the subject but also to develop independent learning skills. What co-construction shows them is that they can learn anything they want to. Teaching requires skill but it isn't a mystery.</p> <p><em>Tom Sherrington is the head teacher of <a href=\"http://www.kegs.org.uk/\">King Edward VI Grammar Scho</a>ol, Chelmsford.

  "<p>It's that time of year again: the architectural beauty pageant known as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/stirling-prize\" title=\"\">Stirling prize</a> has put six buildings in the media spotlight. But what's still missing from the public debate on architecture and design?</p> <p>This year's Stirling shortlist has been declared an \"austerity\" list, the prevalence of exposed concrete and stripped-back forms supposedly reflecting our straitened times. Yet these are some of the most expensive projects built this year, representing the upper echelons of architectural production: <a href=\"http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/hepworth-wakefield-by-david-chipperfield-architects/5018323.article\" title=\"\">an art gallery</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/lyric-theatre-in-belfast-by-o%E2%80%99donnell-and-tuomey/5019844.article\" title=\"\">a theatre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/london-2012-olympic-stadium-by-populous/5016249.article\" title=\"\">a half-billion pound stadium</a> \u2013 plus the new <a href=\"http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/rothschild-bank-headquarters-london-by-oma/5028910.article\" title=\"\">headquarters of one of the wealthiest banking families in the world</a>. All are undoubtedly good buildings, but this is largely architecture by and for the 1%.</p> <p>As the Guardian's new architecture and design critic, I will be trying to shed light on the other 99%. Through daily posts on this blog, as well as longer features, news and reviews, I hope to open up the conversation beyond the kind of projects that have conventionally made the arts pages of the national press.</p> <p>At a time when our education minister has declared that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/02/new-school-building-designs-curve-ban\" title=\"\">\"we won't be getting any award-winning architects\" to design our schools</a>, and last week <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schoolscapital/buildingsanddesign/baseline\" title=\"\">published standardised guidelines</a> for a bleak flat-pack future, it is vital to raise the public debate on school design. The same goes for housing and hospitals, parks and public spaces \u2013 the physical environment that shapes our daily lives.</p> <p>Architecture and design must be dragged from the cosy world of trade journals and the glossy pages of lifestyle supplements into an open public forum. And we need your help to do it.</p> <p>We want to open up our coverage to bring your knowledge, experience and expertise to play, so that you can contribute ideas and shape the debate. What do you want to see on the site? Which projects, issues, architects and designers are you most keen to discuss? Anything from floating villages to designs of the future, self-build housing to open-source manufacture, endangered heritage to experimental practice.

  "<p>Our friend Lois Benyon, who has died aged 82, had a passionate belief in the integrated education movement in Northern Ireland, which brings together Roman Catholic and Protestant students.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s she was appointed director of the Centre for Educational Management at Ulster University in Belfast. Lois was impressed by the stable and settled environment of schools in Northern Ireland during a time of great civil unrest. For 16 years she served as vice-chair of the governors and chair of the education committee at Lagan college in Belfast, the first planned integrated school in Northern Ireland, which took students from both religious communities and of all abilities. Lois was responsible for appointing many of the staff. The position required commitment, dedication and expertise \u2013 it was a courageous move for her to come to Northern Ireland during this period.</p> <p>She was born and educated in Bolton, Lancashire, and often told the story of her mother pointing out the offices of the Manchester Guardian in Cross Street to her as a young girl. She later became a dedicated reader of the paper, even appearing in its Good to Meet You column.</p> <p>After a position as headteacher at a primary school in Hyde, Greater Manchester, Lois went on to teach at St Katharine's college in Liverpool, also studying for an advanced diploma in primary education and completing her masters. She trained teachers at Padgate College in Warrington in the late 1970s before moving to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Music was Lois's lifelong love and many young people in Belfast benefited from her piano teaching. She also became an accomplished organist. Worshipping at Knockbreda Parish Church, Belfast, she was a popular figure, both in the church choir and the indoor bowling club.</p> <p>Another lifelong interest was football, gained from her father who took her to matches at Burnley from an early age. She frequently flew from Belfast to attend matches.</p> <p>Lois is survived by three cousins, Margaret, Michael and Toby, and several godchildren.</p>",

  "<p>Vandana Shiva, one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/series/top-100-women\" title=\"\">Guardian's Top 100 most inspiring women</a>, is currently leading a campaign to create a global citizens' response on the issue of seed freedom.</p> <p>In 1991, Shiva founded <a href=\"http://www.navdanyainternational.it/\" title=\"\">Navadanya</a>, a movement which aims to protect nature and people's rights to knowledge, biodiversity, water and food. It does this by setting up community seed banks that generate livelihoods for local people and provide for basic needs.</p> <p>Shiva, a scientist, philosopher, feminist, author, environmentalist and activist, explains why the two week campaign on seed freedom against major corporations, which culminates on <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/getinvolved/worldfoodday/en/\" title=\"\">World Food Day</a> later this month, is so important and the consequences of failure.</p> <p>Shiva calls for civil disobedience, quoting Gandhi who said that \"as long as the superstition that unjust laws must be obeyed exists, so will slavery exist\".</p> <p><strong>Why do you refer to the term seed slavery?</strong></p> <p>In another time, some people thought it was alright to own other people as slaves. In our times some corporations think it is alright to own life on earth through patents and intellectual property rights (IPR). Patents are granted for inventions, and life is not an invention. These IPR monopolies on seeds are also creating a new bondage and dependency for farmers who are getting trapped in debt to pay royalties. This is why 270,000 Indian farmers have committed suicide.</p> <p><strong>Why is it such an important issue?</strong></p> <p>Seed slavery is ethically important to address because it transforms the Earth family into corporate property. It is ecologically important because with seeds in the hands of five corporations, biodiversity disappears, and is replaced by monocultures of GMOs (genetically modified organisms). It is socially important because without seed sovereignty, there is no food sovereignty. After all, seeds are the first link in the food chain.</p> <p><strong>What is the role of big business in restricting seed supply?</strong></p> <p>The chemical warfare industry transformed itself into the agri-chemical industry. Now the chemical industry has taken over the seed supply through genetic engineering and patents. They want every farmer in every season everywhere in the world to buy their seeds so they can collect royalties and super profits. The corporations, like Monsanto, wrote the Intellectual Property Rights Treaty of the World Trade Organisation. As a Monsanto representative said: \"In writing this treaty, we were the patient, the diagnostician, the physician all in one.\" They defined seed saving as a crime to establish seed slavery and force farmers to buy their seed and pay them royalties.</p> <p><strong>You refer to the toxicity and uniformity of the seeds from major corporations. What impact are their actions having on farmers and communities?</strong></p> <p>Last year we wrote a report, <a href=\"http://www.navdanyainternational.it/index.php/pubblicazioni/the-gmo-emperor-has-no-clothes\" title=\"\">The GMO Emperor has no Clothes</a>, which pulled together the impact of GMO patented seeds across the world. The first impact is a seed monopoly and the disappearance of diversity. The second impact is increasing costs. The third impact is higher use of chemicals. The fourth impact is the denial to consumers of the right to know what they are eating.</p> <p><strong>Which companies do you feel are most responsible?</strong></p> <p>Monsanto, Dupont, Syngenta, Basf, Dow.</p> <p><strong>What is the motivation for these companies to act in this way?</strong></p> <p>Super profits and the urge to control nature and society.</p> <p><strong>Do these companies have too much influence on the political system and what are their tactics and their effect?</strong></p> <p>They have too much power and are a threat to our democracy and freedom. They control governments, they control the media, they control research. Look at how they hounded out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81rp%C3%A1d_Pusztai\">Dr Arpad Putzai</a> from his job.</p> <p><strong>Most large corporations talk about the need for sustainability, so what would your advice be to these businesses if they were to take corporate responsibility seriously?</strong></p> <p>In the area of seeds and biodiversity my advice to the corporations is simple. You are good at the technologies of warfare. Leave the seeds in the hands of women and small farmers. They have done a far better job.</p> <p><strong>What can be done to prevent these companies from dominating the global seed supply?</strong></p> <p>Build a movement for seed freedom, to save seeds, to protect biodiversity, to reclaim farmers rights, to make patents on seed illegal, to roll back laws like the EU Seed Legislation that are criminalising farmers who use their own seeds.</p> <p><strong>You are planning a fortnight of action on seed freedom from 2-16 October, can two weeks of action actually make any difference against the power of big business?</strong></p> <p>The fortnight of action is to intensify solidarity, synergy and awareness. Our movement for <a href=\"http://seedfreedom.in/\">seed freedom</a> will not stop on 16 October. We will continue until the last farmer and last seed is liberated.</p> <p><strong>If this issue is not addressed, what does the future hold?</strong></p> <p>We will witness in our lifetimes the total disappearance of biodiversity from our farms, the disappearance of small farmers, and the end of real food and our food freedom.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

And, for better or worse, it might change how we see our politicians.</p> <p>Last week's presidential debate didn't have a moment quite as gif-able as, say, <a href=\"http://s.buzzfeed.com/raw/bush-shoe-throw/bush-shoe-throw-03.gif\" title=\"\">President Bush's face-off with a flying shoe</a> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349688482749/bush-shoe-throw-03.gif\" alt=\"bush\" width=\"340\" height=\"240\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>for which there were a number of <a href=\"http://s.buzzfeed.com/raw/bush-shoe-throw/bush-shoe-throw-14.gif\" title=\"\">alternate realities</a> created by internet denizens and collected on Buzzfeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383840\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349688510750/bush-shoe-throw-14.gif\" alt=\"bush gif\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> But it was only a starting point. Perhaps soon, a candidate could succeed or fail not on the strength of their zingers during a debate, but on the gifs they generate afterwards.</p> <p>At worst, some gifs might be meaningless or useless, if knowingly so. But at best, they can be the quickest, most effective form of satire we've yet come across. It's an instant piece of commentary, delivering the setup and punchline simultaneously. And it lives forever inside the collective cultural brain, rolling over and over into perpetuity. We've probably passed the point now of the soundbite and not just because sound is no longer needed. The gif, endlessly looping, replays the same scene forever and ever, thus outdoing the soundbite with its quaint finite format.</p> <p>Into this landscape walked Mitt Romney, by his own design an image of abstracted self-satire, already purposefully appearing like a high-definition, digitally rendered image of what an American president ought to look like were he to be carefully coded for the next big budget animated feature. And he begged to be gif-ed.</p> <p>There's really nothing to it. You can cut a Romney clip from the debate footage from Wednesday night, build a gif subtitled with a phrase like, \"<a href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbch1rKmzl1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" title=\"\">I like coal</a>\" and walk away. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383841\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697472744/ilikecoal.gif\" alt=\"i like coal\" width=\"500\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Or, mystifyingly, have him eat a <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/AASSH.gif\" title=\"\">corn dog</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383842\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697495848/mii_corn_dog.gif\" alt=\"coen dog gif\" width=\"504\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Or have him dance, <a href=\"http://cdn.iwastesomuchtime.com/1062012001320ZM9m6.gif\" title=\"\">gangnam style</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383843\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697533817/mitt_dance.gif\" alt=\"mitt dance\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The effect differs with the context but, essentially, Romney's evening of debate was a series of endlessly gif-able moments, whether they stood out as instances of political expression, or just ripe for rather silly, pointless ridicule.</p> <p>It was different for Barack Obama. During last week's debate, the president either seemed to be talking from miles away or, when he was talking at all, was like a policy wonk with a photographic memory, reciting the latest White House economic briefing memo he just read in the toilet. His extremes were gif-able, but that was about it. </p> <p>Either he was <a href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbcgtkIZSc1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" title=\"\">asleep</a>, </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383844\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349688621366/tumblr_mbcgtkIZSc1rg2rf7o1_500.gif\" alt=\"gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p> <a href=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbckiovqau1rg2rf7o3_250.gif\" title=\"\">babbling endlessly</a> or <a href=\"http://techstroke.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/lightsaber.gif\" title=\"\">brandishing a lightsaber</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397383845\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349697579882/lightsaber.gif\" alt=\"light saber\" width=\"500\" height=\"274\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Source: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/04/romney-obama-debate-live-gifs\">Guardian/Tumblr</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> So what? Maybe it's nothing, but while the post-debate gifs mostly centred on Romney, ridiculing his phrases and generally pointing out the problems he has as a candidate, the lasting cultural images of him will at least feature the messages he set out to project. His quotes were used. The words might appear in neon flashing lights or as satire, but there they are. His phrases were remembered, if only as part of a carnival internet sideshow. By contrast, not only was Obama entirely less memorable, but the internet considered him to have ultimately been completely silent. As far as the gifs are concerned, he might as well have said nothing at all. For a man running to be president again, that cannot be good.</p>",
  "<p>Another \"up\" weekend in North America saw independent releases drive box office to more than 35% ahead of the comparable weekend in 2011. <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/film/movie/149515/taken-2\" title=\"\">Taken 2</a> was in the thick of it. Audiences worldwide clearly still want to see Neeson and his very particular set of skills and the movie opened at No 1 on approximately $50m (\u00a331m) and grossed a further $55m outside North America. Your heart may go out to his on-screen character Bryan Mills every time the family travels overseas \u2013 but the result is big moolah for the cinemas.</p> <p>How Hollywood must wish it had an action hero like Neeson. Deemed too old for such a role in the eyes of unimaginative, risk-averse US studio executives, the gravel-voiced Ballymena man has carved out a terrific second act for himself through the support of gutsier independents. Like its predecessor, Taken 2 is the product of French powerhouse EuropaCorp, who hired Fox to distribute the movie in North America and the bulk of international territories.</p> <p>Neeson is about to start shooting <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/05/liam-neeson-takes-a-walk-among-the-tombstones-in-production-deal-with-exclusive-media-and-cross-creek-pictures/\" title=\"\">A Walk Among the Tombstones</a>, backed by Exclusive Media and Cross Creek Pictures, the producer-financiers behind George Clooney's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142808/ides-of-march\" title=\"\">The Ides of March</a>, among others. He'll play a private eye and Universal will distribute in North America for a fee, like the Fox-EuropaCorp arrangement on Taken 2. To be fair to Universal, they are on board the Neeson air-marshall thriller Non-Stop, but these examples are few and far between.</p> <p>Half of the top 10 movies originate from the independent sector. The next highest-ranking example is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/02/looper-uk-box-office\" title=\"\">Looper</a>, financed by money man James Stern's Los Angeles-based Endgame Entertainment and released by the independent distributor FilmDistrict in association with Sony's TriStar label. Looper dropped to number 4 in its second weekend and stands at a respectable $40.3m. The big question is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/04/looper-chinese-box-office-error\" title=\"\">how much has it taken in China</a>, where the movie's co-financier DMG Entertainment is yet to release official figures from the first two weekends. We expect to hear this week.</p> <p>Cop thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/08/end-of-watch-review\" title=\"\">End of Watch</a> from the aforementioned Exclusive Media is doing well and has racked up $32.8m after three weekends in release through independent distributor Open Road. House at the End of the Street from Relativity Media is at $27.5m after three and PT Anderson's mesmerising <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/02/the-master-review\" title=\"\">The Master</a> has taken $12.3m after three. The Weinstein Company is distributing the movie worldwide and financier Megan Ellison, daughter of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, reportedly invested $25m and will want to see the box office climb. It's a muscular awards contender (certainly for the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman) in the hands of Harvey Weinstein and thus seems likely to appear more lucrative by the end of its run.</p> <p>Disney released Tim Burton's animation Frankenweenie, on a rather insipid $11.5m, is in fifth place. Disney's other offering, Finding Nemo 3D \u2013 a cynical 3D retrofit of Pixar's much-loved global smash \u2013 has not quite electrified audiences as much as the studio will have wanted. It ranks number 10 and has grossed just under $40m after four weekends in release and around $10m outside North America. The original opened in 2003 and took more than $865m worldwide. Why couldn't they have left it alone? This ill-judged release has done little to add to the movie's lustre.</p> <h2>North American top 10, 5-7 October 2012</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149515/taken-2\" title=\"\">Taken 2</a>, $50m</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149648/hotel-transylvania\" title=\"\">Hotel Transylvania</a>, $26.3m.

  "<p>I suspect another cunning plot from our government. Jeremy Hunt calls for no abortions after 12 weeks on purpose, because he knows it's such a ghastly, bonkers idea that Maria Miller's and Nadine Dorries' desire for no abortions after 20 weeks, if you ignore science and what pregnant women want, sounds comparatively reasonable, and you might, in a panic, vote for these creatures.</p> <p>That is if you want more unwanted children around. I would have thought we have enough already. There are loads of them starving away, neglected, orphaned, wandering around the streets and rubbish tips of the world. Why can't Hunt, with his Christian values, concern himself with these unfortunates? I know many of them live abroad, and charity begins at home, but I thought the world was now meant to be a global village.</p> <p>Anyway, we've already got people starving here, queuing up for free food. A baby starved to death last week in Westminster. His mother was sick and destitute. Women for Refugee Women could probably find you some more examples, and who knows, with a few more years of benefits cuts, we'll probably have hungry, grubby children scrabbling over landfill sites and dumps to survive, just as they do in other less fortunate countries.</p> <p>This Thursday, the charity <a href=\"http://www.smallstepsproject.org/\" title=\"\">Small Steps Project</a> will be auctioning swanky celebrity shoes to raise money for children living on filthy, stinking distant dumps who have no shoes at all. Or enough food, clothing, shelter or schooling. All right, I own up. It's my daughter's charity, but once you realise how many children everywhere need help, it seems more sensible to concentrate our efforts on the ones we've got already, rather than the ones who are barely here.</p> <p>But Hunt is unlikely to do that. He's just another man from the dark ages, obsessed with a silly idea, who doesn't know what he's talking about, but is still telling women what to do. In a sane world, we could ignore him, but we can't, because he's in charge. Of health. Heaven help us all. I like to have a laugh, but I can't.</p>",
  "<p>In light of the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/europe-needs-reform-grow-europeans-happen?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">political and economic proposals in Europe</a> \u2013 especially European commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso broaching the \"f-word\" in his call for a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/sep/19/barroso-no-plans-federation\" title=\"\">federation of nation states</a>\" \u2013 the terms of the debate will shift to addressing the following key questions: why should Europe integrate further? And is more federalism really desirable? There are at least two crucial answers to these questions, both of them centred on what Europe will look like, not just in 2015 but also in 2035 and beyond.</p> <p>First, it's important to remember that these decisions are being made in reaction to the ongoing economic crisis and the perils of austerity economics. Economists and commentators have tended to view \"austerity\" on both sides of the Atlantic through the same prism, yet the situation in Europe is quite different than in the US.</p> <p>In the US, there exists a long-standing federal system that collects large amounts of taxes from Americans in all 50 member states into a national treasury that is spent on various nationwide priorities, as decided by the federal government in Washington DC. Little protest is made over which states contribute more to the national pot, or whether Californians or New Yorkers transfer some of their wealth to poorer Alaskans or Mississippians \u2013 which they do, year after year, federal budget after budget. In America, the prevailing philosophy is \"a rising tide floats all boats\", and \"e pluribus unum\": \"out of many, one\", as it says on every US dollar bill.</p> <p>But in the European \"union\", the federal institutions \u2013 whether the chief executive, parliament, central bank or regulators \u2013 are in their infancy. There is a small treasury \u2013 the EU collects about 1% of the member states' GDP, compared with the US federal government absorbing about 24% of America's GDP \u2013 so there are far fewer resources at the European level to deal with a crisis.</p> <p>Instead, national and even regional interests jealously track which EU member states are the economic drivers and which are the alleged slackers. The Germans, Dutch, French and others suddenly find themselves in the very unfamiliar situation of having to extend financial assistance not only to the Greeks but also the Portuguese, the Irish, the Cypriots and increasingly the Spanish.</p> <p>In the US, such geographic spreading around of the wealth is normal, but on the European continent, transfers from wealthy to poorer states are still very controversial. Yet those are an important tool for keeping the continent economically as well as politically stable. If Greece or Portugal, for example, were to sink to \"failed state\" status, it would have a destabilising effect in other parts of Europe.</p> <p>But if Greece and Portugal can't keep up competitively, and also have lost the capacity to devalue their currency as a way of regaining some of its competitiveness, assistance from wealthier states like Germany becomes essential to prevent Greece and Portugal from sinking further. The only way to avoid this would be to expel them from the eurozone, but that entails risks as well, not only short-term but also long-term if they can't adequately police their borders or become further destabilised.</p> <p>So unlike in America, Europe's crisis has not been simply a policy debate over austerity v stimulus. It has been an existential crisis over union, cross-border solidarity and how to define self interest.</p> <p>The second response to \"why more integration and federalism\" is China and India's rise as two of the world's largest economies. This highlights a new 21st century reality: size matters. In today's world, population counts as much as productivity toward determining economic power. Even though most Chinese remain poor, China's rise to the ranks of the world's second-largest economy makes it one of the world's largest traders, creditors and markets for commodities. The decisions it makes shape markets globally.</p> <p>Or as economist Arvind Subramanian has put it: \"GDP and size matter in crude superpower terms. It shows what resources you can bring to the table.\"</p> <p>A Europe composed of dozens of diffuse member states, none of them more than 7% of the population of China or India, would slowly see its productivity and competitive advantages chipped away. But if Europeans can band together and form some kind of federated Europe, with a population of anywhere between 350 million and 500 million people, they have a chance to maintain their quality of life and broadly shared prosperity.</p> <p>European leaders have created a timeline for the proposed reforms that will allow for lots of public debate leading up to the German elections in the autumn of 2013 and the European parliamentary elections in 2014. But they are not waiting for the roar of a popular mandate. Already they are pushing forward toward more integration and democratically accountable federalism, because they believe it is the best hope for Europe in the 21st century.</p> <p>They also apparently believe that this is what most Europeans want as well, notwithstanding the doubts and confusion expressed in opinion polls.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/03/british-universities-set-collapse-mediocrity\" title=\"\">The latest university rankings</a> have prompted another round of questions about the future global distribution of higher education excellence and strength. There has been slippage in the position of some universities in the western hemisphere, with Ireland and Scotland both experiencing this phenomenon. Ireland no longer has any university in the top 100 universities globally; Scotland still has one, Edinburgh, in the top 100 (and rising), but other Scottish institutions have fallen, in some cases significantly.</p> <p>\"Outside the golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge, England's world-class universities face a collapse into global mediocrity, while investment in top research universities in Asia is starting to pay off,\" rankings editor Phil Baty<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/03/british-universities-set-collapse-mediocrity\" title=\"\"> told the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>While there is some drift, the prediction of a British collapse into mediocrity may be a bit premature. It is absolutely right that some of the emerging countries have made major investments in higher education, as one would expect. But this has not produced any instant challenge for global leadership. This latest top 20 contains only one university not in the US or UK, and it is in Switzerland.</p> <p>Furthermore, the success of universities in China, Singapore, Korea and Japan (and only a very small number of the thousands of Asian universities make it into any <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/table/2012/sep/11/top-200-qs-world-university-rankings-2012\" title=\"\">university rankings</a>) is largely based on these institutions 'westernising' their educational and research methods and pouring in money. That hasn't just started last year \u2013 it has been a phenomenon of the past decade, and while the results are certainly there, they are not startling.</p> <p>It is obvious enough that as some countries make a transition into a more developed economic state, their universities will benefit from more investment and higher levels of ambition. But actually, it is rather remarkable that this has not had a much greater impact on the rankings.</p> <p>This is not to say that there aren't issues here to be addressed. The uncertainty about university funding in these islands has certainly had an impact, but so have other factors, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/05/student-visa-row-image-overseas-lse\" title=\"\">the inconsistencies and peculiarities of migration policies</a> as they affect student movement, and the trend for major companies to seek university links away from the more traditional set.</p> <p>What may be much more interesting, however, is this: a hint in the rankings that the university of the future is no longer necessarily the ancient, classical, blue-skies-research institution. The new leader, depending on rankings consulted either the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/11/mit-cambridge-harvard-top-university\" title=\"\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> or California Institute of Technology, may be a more focused, networked and translational university. Other institutions that also reflect this profile have climbed up the rankings. As we try to work out what the role of higher education is to be in the future, this may be the more interesting trend.</p> <p><em>For the QS Top 200 World University Rankings, analysis and subject breakdown, </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/world-university-rankings\" title=\"\"><em>visit our rankings site</em></a></p> <p><em>Ferdinand von Prondzynski is vice-chancellor of </em><a href=\"http://www.rgu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Robert Gordon University</em></a><em> in Aberdeen.

  "<p>Less than one in 10 of the countries that signed up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/29/biodiversity-talks-ministers-nagoya-strategy\" title=\"\">a landmark agreement two years ago to protect endangered species and habitats</a> has taken action to implement the deal, according to the conservation group WWF.</p> <p>The warning comes as officials from more than 190 countries meet in Hyderabad on Monday for a major meeting on safeguarding nature. On the agenda is how governments fund and enact the targets agreed in Nagoya, Japan, in 2010, to halve the loss of natural habitats and increase the area of the world's land taken up by nature reserves from less than 10% currently to 17% by 2020.</p> <p>Named after the region around Nagoya, the <a href=\"http://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/\" title=\"\">Aichi biodiversity targets</a> also called for a marine protected zones to increase from 1% of the world's seas to 10% by 2020.</p> <p>As the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) got underway today, WWF said that although 91% of the CBD's 193 parties have strategies for protecting biodiversity, only 14 had taken into account the plan agreed in Nagoya.</p> <p>Lasse Gustavsson, WWF International's executive director for conservation, said: \"What was agreed in Nagoya really has the power to halt the dramatic loss of biodiversity across the globe and address the main drivers of the destruction. But now governments must prove that Nagoya was not just a platform for empty promises. They need to start taking real steps and implement the targets and commitments they agreed on.\"</p> <p>The issue of how much money will be needed to fund these plans - and, crucially, how to finance them - will be at the forefront of discussions. Richard Benyon, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) minister responsibly for biodiversity, flies out to the meeting next Monday, just before a high-level panel led by economist Pavan Sukhdev reports back to the CBD on how to implement and finance countries' biodiversity strategies.</p> <p>The Brazilian Braulio Ferreira De Souza Dias, executive secretary of the CBD, told delegates today that it was important governments backed the plans with funding. \"Yes, we are facing times of financial crisis, but times of crisis are the best opportunities to make substantive changes in the way we do business. Expenditures on biodiversity should not be seen as costs \u2013 they should be seen as investments that will pay back with significant environmental, social and economic benefits for all our societies,\" <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gPFMNQ9v45N1UgdjTEo_c8oy7rIg?docId=CNG.31ecea4e3f7b435528a370e555d19d1b.1d1\" title=\"\">AFP reported him as saying</a>.</p> <p>\"The important thing is to ensure momentum from Nagoya isn't lost,\" said a Defra spokeswoman. Gustavsson added that governments \"must put money behind their promises and turn their words into action\".</p>",

The chancellor did the media rounds this morning to preview his speech, and welfare will dominate. Follow all the day's events with Andrew Sparrow's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/08/osborne-speech-conservative-conference-live-blog\">politics live blog</a>. <br>The chancellor has outlined plans for a fresh round of \u00a310bn of welfare cuts in 2015-16, and said the government will be proposing new policies on housing benefit soon. On the New Statesman's Staggers blog, George Eaton says the Liberal Democrats <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/lib-dems-cave-osborne-over-%C2%A310bn-welfare-cuts\">have caved in to the chancellor</a> over welfare policy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nick Clegg previously insisted that the Lib Dems would not sign up to further welfare cuts without the introduction of some form of wealth or property tax. But with the Chancellor having already ruled out a \"mansion tax\" or higher council tax bands, it remains unclear what Clegg's party will receive in return for consenting to another attack on the poorest. One possibility is that the coalition will again increase the top rate of capital gains tax and raise stamp duty on multi-million properties.<br>The move will also put further pressure on Labour to say whether, if elected, it would stick to Osborne's spending plans for 2015-16 or adopt its own alternative proposals.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the TUC's Touchstone blog, Richard Exell says Osbourne has <a href=\"http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2012/10/telling-the-truth-about-who-gets-housing-benefit/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">conflated two mistakes about housing benefit</a> \u2013 that it is only for people on the dole, and it is easy for young unemployed people to get housing benefit to pay their rent. He adds: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The assumption that Housing Benefit is a special perk for unemployed people is wrong. So is the notion that young people getting HB are ne'er do wells. I'm worried that we're gearing up for a repeat of what happened in the 1980s, when the Fowler reforms took away 16 and 17 year olds' independent rights to benefit. It's a quarter of a century ago, so some readers may not realise that, before those reforms, you almost never saw young people begging or sleeping in the streets.<br>Those of us who campaigned against the 1986 Social Security Act repeatedly warned that it would force 16 and 17 year-olds into destitution. This was simply ignored by the government of the day, backed up by the same sort of media campaign that we're seeing now. The Act came into effect in 1988, and within a year there were young people sleeping in shop doorways.<br>I fear we're on the verge of repeating that mistake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, on his blog, Camden councillor Theo Blackwell looks at the projected impact of the proposals <a href=\"http://theoblackwell.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/updated-impact-on-under-25s-in-camden.html?spref=tw\">on young people in his borough</a>. The proposals, he writes, will disproportionately hit young people in the social housing sector \u2013 that they seem to impact young people in social housing three times more than young people in private rented accommodation. And he adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For young people who have lost parents, but remain in the area, the changes may well uproot them from their neighbourhood, for vulnerable people getting settled after trauma, this is another unwelcome change.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>(thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jules_birch\">Jules Birch</a> for the link)<br>See also three archive pieces on housing benefit cuts for under-25s. On the Guardian's Reality check blog earlier in the year, Patrick Butler asked whether <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/reality-check/2012/jun/25/is-scrapping-housing-benefit-for-under-25-s-a-good-idea\">scrapping housing benefit for under-25s was a good idea</a>, Kate Webb wrote on the Shelter blog that <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2012/04/when-family-isnt-there-the-state-must-step-in/\">the state must step in when family isn't there</a>, and for Comment is free, Penny Anderson described it as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/07/housing-benefit-under-25s\">a policy with more holes than a sieve</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Tory health policy</strong>. Looking ahead to later in the week, former Labour adviser Paul Corrigan asks <a href=\"http://www.pauldcorrigan.com/Blog/health-policy/what-might-the-conservatives-say-about-nhs-policy-at-their-conference/\">what might the Conservatives say about NHS policy at their conference</a>? He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron's long term strategy for the Conservatives and the NHS was, in the words of some, to 'detoxify' the Conservative brand. Up until the 2010 election this went very well and he must wake up some mornings and wonder what happened to that strategy.<br>Of course we know that Andrew Lansley is what happened to it\u2026<br>\u2026and for reasons that I will never ever understand the Prime Minister agreed to completely undermine his own careful 3 year-long strategy to quieten down the NHS by agreeing, in the summer of 2010, to Andrew Lansley's plans to shake it all up.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he predicts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>They will say they are proud of the NHS. They will point to all of the good stories about the NHS that Andrew Lansley had to be ambivalent about. (He couldn't celebrate too many good stories about the NHS as good stories undermined the case for having to reform it.).<br>They will point out how they have frequently given preferential funding to the NHS when compared to all other services.<br>This will only be a sub subtext at the Conference.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Fascinating figure of the day, from affordable housing campaign group <a href=\"http://www.pricedout.org.uk/\">PricedOut</a>: more than a quarter of Tory MPs are <strong>private landlords</strong>. The FT [\u00a3] reports that the group is <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad1a739c-0f1c-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28hhkuO8b\">calling for tougher tax treatment for buy-to-let landlords</a>. If found that 83 of the Conservative party's 305 elected representatives are making money from private tenants living in properties they own \u2013 one owns 26 \u2013 while a quarter of Labour MPs and 15% of Lib Dems do. </p> <p>\u2022 Charity the <a href=\"http://www.nya.org.uk/\">National Youth Agency</a>, which is calling for a \"<strong>youth premium</strong>\". The charity was at the Conservative conference today to explain its campaign, which calls for the premium to ensure all young people from disadvantaged backgrounds get access to free, high quality youth work. It warns that the Government risks costly damage to future generations if young people aren't given the resources and attention they need.</p> <p>\u2022 A post looking back over the <strong>Labour party conference</strong> on the Community Links blog. Will Horwitz says <a href=\"http://www.community-links.org/linksuk/?p=3576\">he noticed throughout the conference</a> \"increasingly encouraging references to prevention, to the long term consequences of decisions made today, to the calamity of cutting now to spend more later\". He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There seemed to be an awareness not just of the benefits of early action but also the barriers to it, as we have been urging. But weary experience has taught us that rhetoric does not necessarily lead to change \u2013 witness Tony Blair's stirring 1997 speech on the importance of prevention, calling for \"departments to draw up plans for shifting energy and resources from cure to prevention, from clearing problems up to anticipating them.\" Guess which other phrase crops up in the speech: \"one nation Britain.\" Can Labour, this time round, make it One Early Action Nation?</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19826770\">RPI changes 'may hit pensioners'</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/13431/breast_cancer_care_falls_short_of_fundraising_targets\">Breast Cancer Care falls short of fundraising targets</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/health-lottery-raises-only-half-of-its-50m-charitable-fund-target-8201327.html\">Health Lottery raises only half of its \u00a350m charitable fund target</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/tenancies/under-25s-face-further-cuts-to-housing-benefit/6524086.article\">Under 25s face further cuts to housing benefit</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=107231\">Pickles' troubled family programme on target</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/10/private-firms-should-take-over-roads-says-cbi/\">Private firms should take over roads, says CBI</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/9590523/Maternity-leave-should-be-scrapped-as-it-holds-back-women.html\">Maternity leave should be scrapped as it 'holds back women'</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>It's been a year when sport in the UK has reached a fever pitch and traditional TV broadcasters the BBC and Channel 4 have won plaudits for their Olympics and Paralympics coverage, while ITV hitched itself to a new cycling phenomenon by screening live coverage Bradley Wiggins winning the Tour de France. Meanwhile, online content producer <a href=\"http://www.bigballsfilms.com/\">Bigballs Films</a> has been setting a different, and perhaps ultimately more interesting, agenda.</p> <p>Bigballs, based in London's silicon roundabout tech area, is seven years old and has a portfolio of online and on-TV content. But it's now launching a sports channel on YouTube that it hopes will cause a stir and help it ramp up its business both online as well as on traditional TV.</p> <p>With a heavy emphasis on directly involving football fans, BigBalls will be producing Copa90, an interactive football lifestyle and original content channel via YouTube, which will include, at launch, eight different shows.</p> <p>For example, Radio 1 DJ Tom Deacon will host The Eurofan in which he spends a day with home supporters in a Champions League city somewhere in Europe, looked after and given tips by the YouTubers who are following the Copa90 channel.</p> <p>The show and another called Copa90 AllStars, which features showboating players and football stunts, will be previewed on Gillette's YouTube channel, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/gillettefootballclub\">Gillette Football Club (GilletteFC)</a>.</p> <p>\"We want to take a different perspective on football, offering fans something they haven't seen before and something beyond what traditional TV can offer,\" BigBalls chief executive, Tom Thirlwall, told a packed press conference at the Google London HQ a few weeks ago at the launch announcement of GilletteFC.</p> <p>Speaking exclusively to the Guardian Media Network at Soho House later, Thirlwall explained that Copa90 is the beginning of a network of up to 15 sports channels that BigBalls plans to launch over the next three years. \"By creating a network of sports channels we want to create the number one destination for original sports content. There is a hugely passionate and connected audience that isn't being served by traditional TV channels and that's a space we are interested in.\"</p> <p>Not to say that BigBalls isn't interested in traditional TV. BigBalls is working on <a href=\"http://www.bigballsfilms.com/bigballs-goes-fishing-for-trouble-with-channel-4\">Fishing for Trouble</a>, its second commission for Channel 4, and earlier this year it hired Andrew Conrad from independent production company <a href=\"http://www.betty.co.uk/\">Betty</a> as director of TV.</p> <p>Recently however, Conrad's title was changed to director of programmes, which is perhaps more in line with how BigBalls sees its future; Thirlwall says that several of the formats planned for Copa90 could have a second life on TV screens as well, but he clearly thinks that the opportunities online are immense. \"We see YouTube as an amazing opportunity to engage audiences and experiment and find new talent both behind and in front of camera,\" he explains. \"This is a space where you can build your own brands and formats and where you can directly connect and engage with global audiences. That's pretty exciting.\"</p> <p>Bigballs' use of YouTube as a distribution network for its content comes at a time when the world's largest video consumption platform is starting to creep into speeches by more traditional TV executives, including big hitters like Liz Murdoch and X Factor's Simon Cowell.</p> <p>In her MacTaggart lecture at the <a href=\"http://www.mgeitf.co.uk/\">MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival</a> in August, Murdoch said YouTube was \"beginning to act like a market leader\", referring to YouTube's decision to offer upfront funds to producers interested in creating bespoke channels on YouTube's platform (YouTube us expected to announce several dozen more commissioned channels in Cannes at the Mipcom TV market this week).</p> <p>In Edinburgh, Murdoch urged producers to create direct-to-audience channels. \"The new world demands we create services that are sufficiently valued to allow a more interactive and transactional relationship with the viewer. Slapping a hashtag in the corner of the screen doesn't begin to build a community,\" said Murdoch. For his part Cowell recently said that YouTube could be the \"channel 6\" of the UK.</p> <p>This is not the first time Bigballs has caught a wave on the sea of online content. BigBalls produced and directed Kate Modern, the first successful, serialised and sponsored web drama, which launched on social network Bebo in 2007 and won the Broadcasting Press Guild's innovation award and two BAFTA nominations. Vodafone was the sponsor for BigBalls' online murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.bigballsfilms.com/projects/who-killed-summer\">Who Killed Summer?</a> in 2009, which racked up 5 million views in its first five weeks and was also nominated for several prizes including best campaign in the Global Mobile Media Awards.</p> <p>Over the years, BigBalls has worked with brands including Oakley, Adidas and Red Bull, particularly after Thirwall joined the company in 2010 from McCann Erickson-owned Mworks, where he had worked with BigBalls on Who Killed Summer?</p> <p>Several of BigBalls' founders were also founding investors in a separate games company called We R Interactive. Launched two and a half years ago and with investment from media executives including ITV's Fru Hazlitt, Working Title co-founder Eric Fellner and Abbott Mead Vickers' Peter Mead, We R Interactive's standout hit has been the online Nike-sponsored game <a href=\"http://iamplayr.com/\">IAmPlayr</a>, now with 5.2 million active users across over 200 countries.</p> <p>Thirlwall says a virtuous circle is being extended between We R Interactive and BigBalls, which is already the producer of all of We R Interactive's video content. \"We will create shows on Copa90 around what we are doing in IAmPlayr,\" says Thirlwall. \"And IAmPlayr will feature Copa90 within the game.\"</p> <p>Clearly BigBalls is not your traditional independent production company. And that is one reason why YouTube was happy to partner with them on Copa90. Stephen Nuttall, senior director of sports partnerships for YouTube EMEA says: \"Bigballs are passionate about, and committed to, digital. They have a proven track record in creating really strong and entertaining video and the potential to link between IAmPlayr and Copa90 was an intriguing extra dimension.\"</p> <p>Each channel BigBalls creates on YouTube will have a different business model that suits it, says Thirlwall. Some, he thinks, will be funded by brands and some will be self-funded from Bigballs' operating cash flow; YouTube will help with others via upfront \"startup cash\" that will be re-paid through advertising revenue.</p> <p>\"Brands are now totally turned onto the idea that they can be the story and don't have to just sponsor the story,\" says Thirlwall. \"We have to set a very distinct tone and attitude and editorial line on each of these channels and every one has to work editorially. We won't just take money for a brand to pay for a channel.\"</p> <p>BigBalls has about 40 staff and it recently opened an office in Berlin. An LA office is also planned to open soon, says Thirlwall. With turnover expected to double in 2013 to \u00a38m BigBalls is clearly on a roll. \"We make films for a social world,\" says Thirlwall. \"Everything we make we think about how to bring it to an audience as much as we do about how it looks and the storyboard. Many people think that in the digital age that there is still a 'build it and they will come mentality'. But we are not thinking that way. We are interested in building a hyper-engaged, long term audience.\"</p> <p><em>Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator \u2013 follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/katecomments\" title=\"\"><em>@katecomments</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Warner Music-owner Len Blavatnik has invested $130m (\u00a381m) in subscription streaming service Deezer.</p> <p>Blavatnik's Access Industries, which also holds stakes in Top Up TV and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/31/senior-managers-cash-shares-perform?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">digital sports company Perform</a>, has taken an undisclosed stake in Deezer.</p> <p>Deezer, which has its roots in France and counts mobile phone giant Orange as a shareholder, would only say that the deal makes Access Industries a \"cornerstone investor\".</p> <p>Axel Dauchez, chief executive of Deezer, said Access was an important investor but did not hold a majority stake.</p> <p>\"We are separate from Warner Music. Access has a minority stake in our company. I disclose this to other major record labels and explained why we are keeping 100% independence. There is no industrial link between us and Warner Music.</p> <p>Blavatnik described Deezer as a \"state-of-the-art music service with enormous potential\".</p> <p>The company, which expanded to the UK last year, says that it has been profitable since 2010, thanks in part to a partnership with Facebook.</p> <p>Dauchez said the company embarked on a global expansion last year and has reached 2 million subscribers.</p> <p>\"We're very pleased to receive this endorsement from an investor of Access's stature,\" he said. \"They are knowledgeable and active in the media space and their entrepreneurial spirit is very close to who we are\".</p> <p>Deezer said its model to date has been to focus on growth in markets outside the United States \u2013 by far the world's biggest music market with intense competition among digital rivals \u2013 where it is costly to grow a customer base.</p> <p>Blavatnik's Warner Music has strength in the US market, indicating that Deezer's deal is likely to pave the way to attempting to break into North America.</p> <p>\"Both the recovery and the future growth of the music business require companies like Deezer to develop profitable, long-term business models that deliver for all industry players,\" said Dauchez.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>It's a tough time for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/youngpeople\" title=\"\">young people in the UK</a>, with thousands of them facing bleaker employment prospects than at any time in recent history, and access to one of the traditional routes to employment \u2013 university \u2013 narrowing due to the increased cost associated with higher education.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Roundhouse</a> works with 3,000 11 to 25 year olds each year, but what constantly surprises me about those I meet is that I rarely hear much complaint about the climate they find themselves in. Instead, I encounter a real spirit of enterprise, a readiness to adapt to this state of affairs, to think laterally, to be proactive and to find opportunities that work for them.</p> <p>Increasingly, it is creative organisations that can provide those opportunities. Our own youth programme is able to offer young people access to industry-standard facilities, practical experience, tuition and mentoring from industry professionals and vital connections within its specialist fields of music, media and the performing arts.</p> <p>The creative industries are becoming one of the UK's most important sectors, contributing over \u00a328bn gross value added to the economy (<a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/research_and_statistics/6241.aspx\" title=\"\">according to DCMS statistics</a>), but the sector is notoriously difficult to get into for those with no previous related skills or experience. In this industry \u2013 as in the wider careers market at present \u2013 employers are apt to undervalue young people's potential.</p> <p>The best parts of my job are witnessing the moments when our model works to overcome this, as with Elise Cobain, <a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/874060-elise-cobain-s-story-behind-the-olympic-torch\" title=\"\">a young radio producer and presenter</a> who came to the Roundhouse in 2010 and progressed through the ranks of our in-house station <a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/explore/radio\" title=\"\">Roundhouse Radio</a>, before leaving last year for a permanent post at XFM, progressing within a year to her self-confessed 'dream job' at BBC Radio 1.</p> <p>It's not just about those with their sights set on careers in the creative industries either. Young people whose professional aspirations lie in business, engineering and community work get a great deal out of taking part in creative activities too. Not only do they provide an invaluable expressive outlet, they also develop collaboration, negotiation, problem-solving, creative thinking and absolute dedication to the realisation of a goal \u2013 all skills as valuable in the board room as the rehearsal room.</p> <p>This kind of participation helps give young people the tools to build better futures for themselves, whatever their circumstances and whatever paths they choose, something that is particularly important for the 40% of Roundhouse participants whose circumstances have led to them becoming \u2013 or placed them at risk of becoming \u2013 marginalised or excluded. In today's economic conditions, young people need all their tenacity and enterprise to carve out a niche for themselves.</p> <p>But there's a further, crucial dimension to this that is sometimes overlooked. The frontline cultural organisations that deliver these opportunities would not be able to support this development without the backing of those who believe in the work sufficiently to fund it.</p> <p>One of the Roundhouse's greatest assets is its relationship with these funding organisations, of which the <a href=\"http://www.phf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Paul Hamlyn Foundation</a> is one example. The foundation's work extends well beyond the arts into education and social projects but many of its grantees use the arts and creativity as a means to help people develop skills, communication and self confidence. They, and other independent funders, recognise the value these opportunities bring.</p> <p>This week has been a big one for both organisations: the Roundhouse became the beneficiary of a \u00a35m endowment made to mark the Paul Hamlyn Foundation's 25th anniversary, a gift that will contribute annually to ensure the future of our work with young people. To reflect the nature and importance of this collaboration, our creative studios for 11 to 25 year olds have become the <a href=\"http://www.phf.org.uk/news.asp?id=1755\" title=\"\">Paul Hamlyn Roundhouse Studios</a>, the creative centre for young people that was at the heart of the vision of our founder, Torquil Norman.</p> <p>We are fortunate to have an ally in our mission to support young people to achieve great things in creative disciplines. More (and better) partnerships between organisations such as ourselves and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation are vital at a time when young people face so many challenges: high living costs and debt, low levels of employment, and reduced help from government.</p> <p>Partnerships like this \u2013 between funders and frontline organisations \u2013 are integral to making sure we don't squander the creative potential of the next generation, and don't leave them feeling so undervalued and unsupported that they become disillusioned, demoralised and demotivated. Youth organisations and funders must work together to pioneer and expand schemes that help young people realise their potential and thrive in an increasingly tough environment. They must also ensure their collaboration extends the reach of this work to even greater numbers of young people.</p> <p><em>Marcus Davey is chief executive and artistic director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Roundhouse</em></a><em> \u2013 follow it on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoundhouseLDN\" title=\"\"><em>@RoundhouseLDN</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Recruitment group <strong>Michael Page International</strong> has issued another profit warning, hit by the continuing slowdown in Europe, the middle east and Africa.</p> <p>Cutbacks in the financial sector and the poor outlook for the global economy have, inevitably, led to a decline in the number of companies taking on staff, and employees being reluctant to move jobs. So with the traditional summer lull, the company said third quarter profits fell 8% compared to the previous three months and 11% on the same period last year.</p> <p>So, it warned, full year operating profits would be slightly below current City expectations. It has cut its own headcount - excluding the annual UK graduate intake - but maintained this was done mainly through \"natural attrition.\" Chief executive Steve Ingham said:</p> <blockquote> In most regions activity levels improved towards the end of the third quarter. However we do anticipate another challenging fourth quarter, with economic conditions and market confidence likely to remain poor for the foreseeable future. </blockquote> <p>The news has sent its shares down 11.8p to 353.3p, a decline of more than 3%. Seymour Pierce issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> For the second time in less than a year, Michael Page has warned that pretax profits would come below consensus expectations as conditions gradually deteriorate in most of its markets. <br> The poor outturn is a reflection of Michael Page's bias towards permanent placements (77% of group), which saw an 8% reduction year on year. Temps were marginally higher (+0.4%). Michael Page has the highest exposure to permanent placements of all the stocks under our coverage. At this stage of the cycle, we believe temporary placements will prove more resilient. By discipline, the slowdown in financial services continued to take its toll with the Finance &amp; Accounting division down 12% year on year.  Following our 12% downgrade, the shares are trading on 26.2 times 2012 estimated profits falling to 21.9 times for 2013. We continue to believe this is too high given the uncertainty. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere <strong>FirstGroup</strong> continued to fall back following last week's shock withdrawal of the West Coast franchise amid bid irregularities at the Department of Transport. It lost another 5.2p to 190.9p, with Deutsche Bank the latest to issued downbeat note on the business. Recommending clients to sell, the bank said:</p> <blockquote> We believe the loss of West Coast focuses attention on a FirstGroup balance sheet that continues to look stretched. Removal of the franchise reduces 2013 and 2014 earnings per share by 5.4% and 16.3% respectively but more importantly means that we now expect a net cash outflow of \u00a330m in the year to March 2013. <br> Comparing this to our net debt forecast of \u00a32bn would suggest material cash strain during a necessary period of simultaneous deleveraging and UK bus investment. Therefore in spite of a better medium term risk profile (from the loss of West Coast) we see the potential for a painful cash shortfall if generation/retention does not improve. </blockquote> <p>Peter Hyde at Liberum Capital said the transport group was in the \"last chance saloon\" although he has a buy recommendation on the shares:</p> <blockquote> Profitable extensions to First Great Western and First Capital Connect [franchises] offer a last chance saloon. Otherwise 2014 will be another \"transition year\", the dividend will definitely be cut and FirstGroup will have a tricky decision to take regarding debt reduction, further asset sales and/or a rights issue. The shares look cheap both pre and post a rights issue. </blockquote> <p>He suggested a cash call of \u00a3400m could be possible:</p> <blockquote> Clearly investment is not for the faint hearted. However, at the current share price, and even assuming a \u00a3400 rights issue, we see possible upside. </blockquote> <p>Online grocer <strong>Ocado</strong> has lost 2.85p to 65.85p in the wake of weekend reports that <strong>Morrisons</strong>, up 1.6p to 279.8p, planned to launch on online food service next year.</p>",
  "<p>When I started university, people told me: \"These will be the best days of your life.\" I was leaving my snoozy town in the countryside and heading towards the sparkle of the big city to study fashion journalism at the London College of Fashion (LCF).</p> <p>Not only would these be the best days of my life, everyone said, but they would be also be the most glamorous.</p> <p>They couldn't have been more wrong. By the end of my first year I was seriously considering dropping out. I had not made as many friends, had as much fun, or enjoyed my course as much as I thought I was going to. My shoulders sagged with the weight of my disappointment, and I blamed myself. \"I chose this. Is it my fault I am not living the university dream?\" I felt sad and desperately lonely. But I didn't tell anyone.</p> <p>I certainly didn't put it on Facebook \u2013 its culture of competitive sharing made me feel even worse. Scrolling through my friends' feeds, it was clear they were having a ball.</p> <p>Jemma Lamble and I are friends on Facebook \u2013 what impression did she get from my profile?</p> <p>\"There is one feeling I got when I clicked on 'Libby Page Facebook' and that is jealousy. You looked like you were really enjoying yourself.\"</p> <p>Talking to fellow students has made me realise how little resemblance our Facebook lives bear to our real ones.</p> <p>\"University life wasn't the walk in the park I had expected,\" says Jemma, who studies fashion journalism at the University of the Creative Arts, Epsom. \"I certainly didn't expect the feeling of gruelling loneliness that I experienced because I found it hard to connect with the people on my course.\"</p> <p>\"Studying fashion can make it especially hard to make friends,\" says Natasha Slee, a coursemate at LCF. \"Lots of people are really focused on trying to be cool, so it makes for a very different social life.\"</p> <p>Sophie Smith (name changed at her request), who is studying fashion styling and photography at LCF, remembers her first day: \"As I walked into my first class I tried my hardest to smile at everyone and make friends. But I was shocked by how blank some people were. I said to one guy, 'wow, LCF, I still can't believe I'm here'. He replied, 'well LCF are lucky to have me'. I don't want to label everyone on the course because there are some lovely people too, but I do think the environment at a fashion university can be hard.\"</p> <p>The students' union doesn't have much of a presence at LCF. \"I recently heard about an event organised by the SU on Facebook: 200 people had been invited but only two were attending,\" says Natasha. \"For me that sums up LCF.\"</p> <p>Fairooz Aniqa, culture and diversity officer for the University of the Arts London (of which LCF is a college), says social events are not a top priority for the union. \"It is really hard to organise events for students here. We represent six colleges and the university is so spread out. There is no sense of community.\"</p> <p>Fairooz says arts students want more help with their careers than with their meeting other students. \"In the arts industry, we have to network and do internships and work, and it is all very business-minded, so socialising can drop to one side. We have got the message from students that they don't want to socialise through us, so we plan networking events instead. We always try to have a career element instead of organising meaningless social events.\"</p> <p>In the latest National Student Survey, which came out last month, UAL <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/datablog/2012/sep/28/worst-student-unions-national-survey\" title=\"\">ranks second last for student satisfaction</a> out of all the universities in England. And just 57% of its students are satisfied with the students' union.</p> <p>When you are feeling lonely, the one thing that can make you feel even more alone is something designed to do the opposite: a social network.</p> <p>\"I thought that everyone on Facebook was having a better time than me,\" says Jemma. \"A lot of people I knew had gone to universities in big cities, so my Facebook feed was constantly flooded with evidence of the great nightlife in these places. This upset me because I wasn't being tagged in pictures enjoying myself like they were.\"</p> <p>\"If you're having a bad day, the last thing you want to do is go on Facebook and see another happy couple or another fun party that you're not at,\" agrees Natasha.</p> <p>So how honest are our Facebook lives?</p> <p>\"When I post a photo of me out having a good time in Mayfair, I genuinely am having a good time out in Mayfair,\" says Sophie. \"But I'm not going to post a photo of me lying in bed eating left-over pizza.\"</p> <p>\"People want to show the best bits of their experiences to prove to their peers that they are having a good time,\" says Jemma.</p> <p>I am aware that by hiding the truth about my experiences from even my closest friends, I have become part of the problem.</p> <p>My time at university may not have been the dream that I signed up for, but it has made me who I am.</p> <p>LCF did not provide me with the social experience I dreamed of, but it has made me appreciate the good friends I have kept from my childhood and each new one I have made here. Studying in London, without the comfort of a cosy campus, was terrifying at times, but I have become much more independent as a result. Not finding what I wanted on my course and within the walls of my university has made me go out and look for it myself.</p> <p>Now that I am starting my third and final year I can look back and see that university has been an experience. It just hasn't been the one I was expecting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397386713\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349712104685/OUP-promo-trail-001.jpg\" alt=\"OUP promo trail\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">OUP promo trail Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>Beijing authorities have completed a network of monitors that will more accurately measure air quality in the smog-ridden city after being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/10/internet-beijing-dirty-air-pollution\" title=\"\">pushed into it by public pressure</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/dec/07/blog-beijing-smog\" title=\"\">pollution reports from the US embassy</a>.</p> <p>The Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Centre said on Saturday that another 15 monitoring stations had begun releasing real-time data on small particulates known as PM2.5. The tiny pollution particles that may result from the burning of fuels in vehicles and power plants can penetrate deep into the lungs, so measuring them is considered a more accurate reflection of air quality than other methods.</p> <p>Chinese citizens have prodded their government into publishing more detailed pollution data since the US embassy started publishing PM2.5 readings taken from its rooftop on Twitter.</p> <p>Beijing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/22/beijing-releases-pollution-data-pressure\" title=\"\">started releasing PM2.5 data in January</a>. It now has 35 monitoring stations set up in central Beijing and its suburbs, including near tourist favourites Tiananmen Square, the Temple of Heaven and the Beijing botanical garden.</p> <p>The monitors will run for a three-month trial, and then the city's environmental protection department will formally use PM2.5 to evaluate the city's air quality, rather than relying on the larger particles it currently measures.</p> <p>White mist sat stubbornly among the capital's skyscrapers on Sunday as people travelled home on the final day of an eight-day public holiday that had brought with it mostly blue skies as industry shut down.</p> <p>\"Is it fog or is the PM2.5 higher than normal?\" Zhao Yiyi, at Beijing airport, wrote on the popular microblogging site <a href=\"http://www.weibo.com/\" title=\"\">Sina Weibo</a>. She added\": \"Such air quality, it's horrible.\"</p> <p>Just after lunchtime, the US embassy, which measures the air from its rooftop, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeijingAir/status/254810173405802496\" title=\"\">tweeted</a> that the PM2.5 reading, at 137 micrograms per cubic meter, was unhealthy.</p> <p>The Beijing environmental monitoring website reported a similar reading from a nearby station for that hour, but it didn't interpret the data. Guidance on the website suggested that such a reading would be termed satisfactory if it became part of the daily air quality roundup. The US embassy rates pollution levels according to a US Environmental Protection Agency standard, which is more stringent than that used by the Chinese government.</p> <p>Appearing frustrated with the dueling standards, the Chinese government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/05/china-embassies-smog-readings-illegal\" title=\"\">told the embassy to stop publishing the data in June</a>. It said it wasn't fair to judge Chinese air by American standards because China is a developing country and noted that US environmental guidelines have become more strict over time.</p> <p>US consulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu also post readings of the cities' air quality on Twitter.</p> <p>Last month, the US ambassador to China indicated that its remaining consulates in Shenyang and Wuhan would also monitor air pollution levels.</p> <p>\"We've been criticised by the Chinese government for having such a monitor, but we feel it's a duty \u2013 our duty to inform our dependents and our Americans of the air conditions there so they can make appropriate decisions regarding the health of their children and themselves,\" Gary Locke said, according to the transcript of the event at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, DC. \"We're expanding this to all the different consulates throughout China.\"</p> <p>Explaining PM2.5 to the audience, Locke said: \"It's the really invisible stuff that can really cause a lot of damage to respiratory systems and health. It's almost akin to being exposed to secondhand smoke constantly, or even smoking several packs a day.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cornwall may be most famous for its beautiful coast, but there is more to the south-west corner of the UK than tourism and hospitality.</p> <p>Those considering starting a business in Cornwall would be welcomed by a vibrant community of small businesses and plenty of resources to help them get started.</p> <p>\"The small business network here is very close and tight. Everybody is always willing to help each other,\" says Charlotte Parker, the founder of cleaning business Charlie's Angels. \"There's a great community spirit. I work alongside lots of other small businesses and we support each other.\"</p> <p>From a population of 500,000 there are currently 22,000 VAT-registered businesses. Nearly all of them are small and medium-sized. \"All but 60 of these businesses are SMEs,\" says Kim Conchie, the chief executive of Cornwall Chamber of Commerce. \"We estimate that there are at least as many small businesses below the VAT threshold, but there is no way of knowing exactly how many smaller businesses there are throughout the region.\"</p> <p>Conchie says the business community in Cornwall is very broad. \"Businesses range from the bedrock industries you'd expect to see in Cornwall, such as food and tourism, as well as those with mining heritage,\" he explains. \"But we also have vibrant groups of more modern industries including knowledge-based businesses as well as those in marine renewables.\"</p> <h2>Plenty of talent</h2> <p>A growing graduate population means there is a rich talent pool and Cornwall is well above the national average in terms of qualifications held by its residents. Many graduates choose to stay in the region after completing their degrees.</p> <p>\"There's no doubt that Cornwall is an attractive place to live and work in, which, in turn, means there's no shortage of skills and talent in the county \u2013 particularly in growth sectors like IT, renewable energy and aerospace,\" says Alison Elvey de Rios, a manager at Invest in Cornwall. \"The launch of the south west marine energy park earlier this year will consolidate much of the expertise we have in marine energy, helping Cornish businesses in the sector grow and expand into international markets. In the aerospace sector, the new Aerohub enterprise zone at Newquay Airport is set to create up to 2,500 jobs by attracting businesses that will benefit from a simplified planning system and business rate discounts.\"</p> <p>One entrepreneur who has successfully taken advantage of Cornwall's hospitality heritage is Ben Hawkins, who launched bakery Da Bara with his brother last year. They have since scooped big clients including Jamie Oliver's Fifteen restaurant in Watergate Bay.</p> <p>\"My brother and I both have a background in the hotel and catering trade and we started our business specifically targeting that sector,\" he says. \"We started out on a part-time basis baking at the weekend and test-traded that way. We set up a little industrial unit in our spare time and launched full-time six weeks after. It has gone really well.\"</p> <h2>Happier days</h2> <p>Cornwall has come through some bleak periods of high unemployment after the decline of traditional mining and fishing industries. Identified as an Objective One region by the European Union in 1999, the county received \u00a3350m in funding to revive its fortunes. Eight years later, in 2007, still deemed to have an economy below the EU average, the region was awarded Convergence status and received a further \u00a3415m to develop the local economy through investment in people and infrastructure.</p> <p>This funding means that there is now a solid business-ready infrastructure in place. Already there is 97% broadband coverage and by 2014, the \u00a3132m <a href=\"http://www.convergencecornwall.com/convergence-investments/next-generation-broadband-for-cornwall-and-the-isles-of-scilly-.php\" title=\"\">Next Generation Broadband</a> project will bring Europe's fastest broadband connectivity to Cornwall.</p> <p>There are plenty of encouragements for prospective startups, with an array of organisations offering practical and financial support. \"In the current economic climate, the financial help available to businesses locating in Cornwall is particularly compelling,\" says Elvey de Rios. \"The county provides some of the highest levels of business support and grants in the UK, such as the Grant for Business Investment, which offers up to 50% matched funding.\"</p> <h2>Startup support</h2> <p>When launching Da Bara, Hawkins received startup support from Outset Cornwall, a free programme for people who have a business idea and need help to get it off the ground. \"While we were doing the part-time baking, I went along to Outset Cornwall every week to attend their intensive startup course. It helped so much, especially with pricing our products. I think we'd have struggled without their help,\" he says.</p> <p>He has enjoyed being part of the vibrant group of small businesses in the county. \"It is very active. Our business is on a small estate and there are lots of very small businesses. There are no empty units here.\"</p> <p>However, it is a competitive environment, he explains. \"With a smaller population you have to try that little bit harder to bring in enough money.\"</p> <p>On the upside, the smaller population also means that things move at a slower pace, which can be helpful for startups, says Parker. \"If you are in a bigger place like London and Bristol it may be harder to get all the support you need because people don't have the time, they are so busy. But in Cornwall it is a lot more laid back and there is time for people to sit back and listen and give each other great tips,\" she explains.</p> <p>Of course, it's impossible to talk about starting a business in Cornwall without mentioning the quality-of-life factor. Whether starting a new business or relocating an existing venture, Cornwall is bound to delight you with its 300 miles of stunning coastline and beautiful inland moors, combined with low rates of crime and more daylight hours than any other part of the UK.</p> <p>Hawkins says the quality of life is a highlight of running his own business in the area. \"The cost of living is fairly high, but Cornwall is a lovely place to be. It is nice and quiet and being able to go to the beach when you are not working is great,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>While carbon zero is the target that new houses aim to achieve from 2016, Sinclair Meadows \u2013 a new social housing scheme in south Tyneside \u2013 will operate at 15% beyond the government's definition of carbon zero. This far surpasses the code for sustainable homes, and moves into carbon negative territory.</p> <p>The technology involved and the design of the homes is cutting edge, but it is the commitment, lifestyle and training of those living in them that will make the project a success and provide an insight into how housing providers can create sustainable communities.</p> <p>To help tenants maximise the benefits of their carbon negative home, they have undergone pre-occupation training sessions and further training and support will be provided over the next 12 months.</p> <p>From simple guidance such as programming appliances to operate during the day so they can be powered by the solar PV panels, to more complex behaviour change such as adjusting to living on a car-free street, the success of the scheme relies heavily on the community.</p> <p>Crucial to the success is the commitment of tenants to living carbon negatively. Throughout the year community-wide training workshops will focus on each aspect of the development, including rain water harvesting and the biomass boiler. Tenants will be encouraged to direct the training and focus it on their priorities. They will also develop an understanding of the biodiversity and ecology of the site, including how to manage the vegetable patches, herb gardens and composting facilities.</p> <p>A community development worker will work closely with tenants over the first 12 months to offer technical support and encourage community ownership and the development of skills to maximise the benefits of living in a carbon-negative community.</p> <p>Each house has an energy-monitoring system installed, which shows the occupiers the energy being used at any one time and encourages them to make informed decisions about how they can reduce their consumption. This will be remotely monitored by the organisation and evaluated to inform the industry of how the buildings are performing and how tenants are using the technology. This in turn allows the community development team to work closely with tenants who may need additional support reducing their bills.</p> <p>A two-year behaviour change research project carried out by a partnering university will assess the extent to which the scheme affects tenants' day-to-day lives. The research will look at the tenant attitudes and behaviours pre-occupation and during their time there, as well as the degree to which a carbon negative community has been established.</p> <p>If these homes are lived in as they are designed to be, residents can benefit from significantly lower energy bills at a time of ever-increasing fuel costs. With triple glazing and all habitable rooms positioned to be south facing, all 21 properties heat up very quickly, with little to no heat escaping, thanks to the enhanced insulation and heat recovery systems, saving both energy and money. The community biomass boiler on site is available for convenience, and residents will be trained in when and how it should be used to heat the properties.</p> <p>There is a growing need to understand how micro-renewable technologies perform in the real world. Data monitoring meters will generate the data to assist Four Housing Group in understanding how fuel poverty can be tackled on a wider scale.</p> <p>The project is providing key lessons in helping us achieve our own carbon reduction agenda, but we hope it will also prove an excellent opportunity to share what we have learned with the wider housing, construction and academic sectors, as well as to help inform tenant engagement programmes across the UK.</p> <p><em>Paul Tanney is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.4hg.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Four Housing Group</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and best practice</strong></p>",
  "<p>Following in the footsteps of one <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/feb/01/fernando-torres-chelsea-big-step-forward?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Fernando Torres</a>, I have moved from Liverpool to Chelsea to take up my new job as <a href=\"http://www.chelwest.nhs.uk/about-us/news/chelsea-and-westminster-hospital-welcomes-new-chief-executive\" title=\"\">the chief executive of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital</a> on 3 September.</p> <p>Like many people who start their career in clinical practice in the NHS, my clinical career has been in nursing. I never set out to be a chief executive. But having previously worked as the chief executive at Alder Hey Hospital and the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust is my third tour of duty.</p> <p>Looking back over my first month here at Chelsea and Westminster, I can honestly say that the experience has both surprised and delighted in many respects. The positive staff attitude, the commitment of the consultant staff and the vibe of walking into a hospital with one of the most creative designs in the UK combine to offer a real sense of excitement and enterprise.</p> <p>This was reinforced by <a href=\"http://www.chelwest.nhs.uk/about-us/news/news-archive/2010/annual-members2019-meeting\" title=\"\">the trust's annual members' meeting </a>on 16 September, where the public turned out in strength and the council of governors representing 15,000 members of thetrust gave testimony to the high regard and affection in which this hospital is held.</p> <p>This is all a great tribute to the leadership and stewardship of the trust at a time of repeated criticism of public services.</p> <p>But \u2013 and there is always a but \u2013 how do we maintain that level of success and support in the face of the biggest structural change the NHS has seen since its inception in 1948 and the unprecedented enduring economic climate?</p> <p>I have spent much of this first month in meetings with colleagues, getting up to speed with what's going on locally, how that fits with national policy and what the implications are for how we run our services and continue to improve the patient experience.</p> <p>Attending the public consultation meetings on NHS North West London's services strategy, <a href=\"http://www.northwestlondon.nhs.uk/shapingahealthierfuture/\" title=\"\">Shaping a healthier future</a>, the support for the NHS is overwhelming. Yet the anxiety over access to high quality services is palpable as both health service professionals and the public as taxpayers and patients face very difficult questions about a sustainable model of healthcare and the changes we need to make.</p> <p>The NHS is inextricably linked to higher education, through the two sectors' mutual concern for delivering the best possible research and teaching environments. Much of our discussion between the NHS and universities focuses on strengthening partnerships, sharing resources where possible and collaborating, to reduce costs and improve the quality of what we do.</p> <p>But it is not just these two sectors that have to deliver more in a different way. Chelsea and Westminster runs the biggest sexual health and HIV service in Europe and very shortly the commissioning budget for the sexual health part of this service will transfer to local authorities, as part of their wider responsibilities for public health under the Health and Social Care Act.</p> <p>I could go on but I won't. The picture is clear \u2013 managing change in this complex and multifaceted environment is a big part of being a health service manager today.</p> <p>Of course, what matters is to ensure that all that change does not overwhelm our day job of getting things right today and this week for our patients and their families. That means taking time to get out in the hospital and its community-based services to understand the services we deliver and what our staff and patients think about them.</p> <p>One of our biggest challenges as managers and leaders in this time-poor world is to be sufficiently visible and accessible to our most important resource \u2013 our staff. Being omnipresent is almost an essential requirement of the job and the weekly reflection of \"did I get the balance right?\" is often a frustrating experience.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it has always been thus and anyone who has been around long enough will testify to the relentless expectation we have of our healthcare system and the overwhelming demand that faces us. Collaboration will be the touchstone for success if we are to stand any chance at all of meeting that demand \u2013 there will be no room for unnecessary duplication of services and that will challenge our thinking and our political will at a local level.</p> <p>I am very aware from my discussions with colleagues and observations across the NHS that this is not simply a local issue. There isn't anywhere that I know of in the UK that isn't having these discussions and grappling with the choices that have to be made. It's a manifestation of our success in medicine, technology and science. We live longer and hopefully more active lives but consequently we have become a much higher-maintenance population to serve.</p> <p>The challenge of that is how to manage the changes we need to make while continuously improving what we do. It's here that we have the opportunity to do our best work through innovation and enterprise. It's the promise of what we might create and the good that we might do that gets us out of bed every morning, whether we are a doctor, a nurse or a manager.</p> <p>So it's the end of another week and time to reflect \u2013 I've met some great people again, spent time with our superb <a href=\"http://www.chelwestcharity.org.uk/home_10679.html\" title=\"\">hospital charity</a> at their Arts for Health launch, and got to take a close-up look at some of our services.</p> <p>I've absolutely no doubt that people haven't seen me around enough and I've spent too much time in meetings. But I also have a sense through my conversations with colleagues that all of our organisations are experiencing the same in every respect. It's a time of tremendous uncertainty and personal responsibility for us all. It's daunting, it's challenging, it's rewarding \u2013 and we call it the NHS.</p> <p><em>Tony Bell is the chief executive of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

  "<p>Weakness in the global steel market has led to a profit warning from industrial group <strong>Cookson</strong>, sending its shares tumbling nearly 14%.</p> <p>It said trading performance in its engineered ceramics division in the third quarter, and the last month in particular, had been weaker than expected. The division supplies products and systems to the steel industry, which accounts for around half its revenue, and has been hit by falls in steel production. According to industry statistics production fell by 3% in July and August excluding China, and 1% for the world as a whole. September has seen further weakening, rather than the usual upturn after the summer lull:</p> <blockquote> News flow from the ultimate end-markets, such as heavy truck, higher-end automotive, wind turbines, and construction, mining and agricultural equipment, is indicating a further general slowdown in production levels that started to become evident towards the end of the second quarter. <br> </blockquote> <p>The division's solar business also continued to be depressed, the company said, and it has taken action to cut costs including closing one of its two Chinese factories, resulting in a \u00a316m write-off and \u00a31m of restructuring costs.</p> <p>Cookson said if the situation continued, the performance of its ceramic division in the second half would be below expectations and lower than the first six months:</p> <blockquote> As a result, full year performance for the group as a whole is now expected to be materially below the board's previous expectations. </blockquote> <p>The company said plans for its proposed demerger were progressing well and it expected to give a further update before the end of the year.</p> <p>The dismal outlook has sent its shares down 85p to 530p, and Michael Blogg at Investec said he expected earnings estimates to fall by 10% to 15% after the news. <strong>Morgan Crucible Company</strong>, which also makes industrial ceramics, is down 25.2p to 254.3p. Harry Philips at Oriel Securities said:</p> <blockquote> The immediate read across is Morgan Crucible given its solar related/renewables in China. Elsewhere, IMI and Bodycote on the truck reference but we have spent a great deal of time with Bodycote ahead of our initiation last week and IMI was in robust form on Thursday at the capital markets day. </blockquote> <p>With the weakness in the steel industry highlighted by Cookson's figures, Russian steel producer <strong>Evraz</strong>, controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, has fallen 12.5p to 241.6p, the biggest faller in the leading index.</p> <p>Commodities companies in general are weaker, after the World Bank cut its growth forecasts for the key Asia and Pacific region, saying the slowdown in China could get worse and last longer than expected.</p> <p><strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> has lost 40p to \u00a310.61 and <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> is down 10.7p at 322.6p.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is 43.99 points lower at 5827.03, with worries about the eurozone also to the fore as Eurogroup finance ministers meet.</p>",
  "<p>The largest investor in BAE Systems has thrown the defence contractor's proposed \u20ac35bn (\u00a328bn) merger with EADS into doubt by raising \"significant reservations\" in a detailed critique that questions the logic, financial benefit and security implications of the deal.</p> <p>Invesco Perpetual, which owns 13.3% of the company, took the unusual step of going public with its concerns on Monday morning, ahead of Wednesday's UK takeover panel deadline to thrash out an agreement between BAE and EADS.</p> <p>Invesco said it could not see the rationale for the merger between a British defence business and the owner of Airbus. \"Other than diversification \u2013 which investors can achieve for themselves more cheaply and simply \u2013 Invesco does not understand the strategic logic for the proposed combination,\" the fund management firm said.</p> <p>Invesco's intervention, which echoes concerns raised by the EADS shareholder Lagard\u00e8re and Conservative MPs, makes it likely that there will be an extension to the Wednesday deadline. In a point-by-point critique, Invesco added that the deal would \"materially jeopardise\" BAE's position in the US defence market; the proposed holding of stakes by the French and German governments would result in a business driven by politics and not shareholder value; and there would be lower dividends for BAE shareholders in the future.</p> <p>\"Invesco has, on and off, owned shares in BAE for over 20 years. Invesco believes BAE is a strong business with distinctive positions in the global defence market (especially in the US and UK) and good standalone prospects. We look forward to discussions with the board of BAE and other BAE shareholders in the coming days.\"</p> <p>Invesco's intervention comes as the British, French and German governments hold further talks on Monday in an attempt to break the impasse over the merger. Sources close to the proposed combination of Britain's largest defence contractor and the owner of Airbus admitted that both companies are likely to seek an extension to the deadline. One source said it was \"less likely than more likely\" that a deal will be reached by Wednesday, although the granting of more time by the panel is considered a formality given the complexities of the merger. \"The betting is on an extension being applied for,\" said the source.</p> <p>EADS's and BAE's advisers have made preparations for an extension, while playing down reports from Germany last week that intergovernmental talks over the deal are on the verge of collapse. The French and German governments each control 22.35% of EADS through direct and indirect shareholdings, while the British government can block the transaction through a golden share in BAE that allows it to prevent foreign ownership of the business.</p> <p>Talks to protect those national interests have hit difficulties after a conference call between government representatives on Friday saw Germany stun France and the UK with a request that the headquarters of the combined business be based in Munich. Germany is also seeking a guarantee from Paris that its stake in the new company will not be larger than 9%, the same size as Berlin's proposed stakeholding.</p> <p>The three governments will make a further attempt to settle their differences in a conference call on Monday. The British representatives on the call will include Bernard Gray, the Ministry of Defence's head of procurement, with France represented by Emmanuel Macron, an adviser to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Germany by Lars Hendrik-R\u00f6ller, chief economic adviser to the chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p> <p>The UK defence secretary, Philip Hammond, warned on Sunday that the government will block the deal if there is excessive French and German control of the business. Such a scenario is also expected to trigger a US veto of the deal, with the Pentagon's approval still needed because it is BAE's biggest single customer.</p> <p>\"We want to see this company \u2026 prospering as a commercial business, focused on doing things that are right for the business, not beholden to or controlled by any one government,\" Hammond told BBC Radio 4.</p> <p>Indicating that the government would allow some French and German ownership, he added: \"It is not necessary to have no French or German government interest in the company. It is necessary to reduce that stake below the level at which it can control or direct the way the company acts.\"</p> <p>The chancellor, George Osborne, told Sky News that the deal must protect UK jobs, with EADS and BAE employing more than 50,000 staff in Britain and representing the country's biggest manufacturing employer. \"Our priorities are of course the national security of the United Kingdom. Second: jobs and investment in the UK.\"</p>",
  "<p>Because <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/15/climate-change-rainfall\">warmer air can hold more water</a>, climate change will give the potential for stronger rainfall events. What this means for the risk of flooding, however, will vary widely from location to location depending on local climatic changes that at present are difficult to predict with confidence.</p> <p>Floods can be caused either by an excess of rainfall leading to greater surface runoff or by storm surges raising the sea level. (The UK Environment Agency provides a <a href=\"http://maps.environment-agency.gov.uk/wiyby/wiybyController?x=531500.0&amp;y=181500.0&amp;topic=floodmap&amp;ep=map&amp;scale=3&amp;location=London,%20City%20of%20London&amp;lang=_e&amp;layerGroups=default&amp;textonly=off\">map</a> showing the local risk from both river and coastal flooding.) Human activity can increase the risks, for example by paving over areas which were previously covered by vegetation, reducing the capacity of the land to absorb rainfall and causing it to run off more quickly. Planning decisions \u2013 such whether to <a href=\"http://downloads.theccc.org.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/ASC%202nd%20Report/ASC%20Adaptation%20Report_Chap3.pdf\">build houses in flood plains</a> or position caravans next to the sea \u2013 can also affect society's vulnerability to floods.</p> <p>Extreme weather events are usually associated with unusual (\"anomalous\") atmospheric circulation patterns. In normal conditions, circulation patterns vary over time and bring with them different kinds of weather. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpsRQtk6IfM\">jet stream</a> in the North Atlantic brings storms and wet weather to the UK; when it is pointing away from the county the result is more settled and drier conditions. Excess rainfall is caused when the atmosphere becomes \"stuck\" in one pattern of circulation, giving wet weather for an extended period in some regions. In this situation, soils and groundwater reservoirs can become saturated, which can leads to flooding as additional rain runs off the land surface. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/14/pakistan-flooding-disaster-partition-gilani\">Floods in Pakistan in 2010</a>, for example, were caused by an unusual pattern of atmospheric circulation which <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/asia-fire.html\">also contributed</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/02/russia-heatwave-wildfires-deaths\">heatwave and fires in Russia</a> in the same year.</p> <p>How will climate change affect these factors? There will be the potential for the atmosphere to hold more water, but climate change may also result in changes to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns like the jet stream, which are harder for climate simulations to predict. <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/e5w4634h16272058/\">Recent results</a> with state-of-the-art climate models have raised the possibility that climate change may affect the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpsRQtk6IfM\">jet stream</a> more than scientists previously expected, making floods in the UK more likely. However, the <a href=\"http://ukclimateprojections.defra.gov.uk/22534\">uncertainty</a> in these projections remains <a href=\"http://ukclimateprojections.defra.gov.uk/22673\">large</a>. Flash flooding could also become more frequent as extreme rainfall events are <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/ch3s3-4-3.html\">consistently predicted</a> to become more severe.</p> <p>The risk of coastal flooding is influenced by the frequency and intensity of storms, and by the local sea level. Although in most areas it is not possible to predict the effect of climate change on storms with certainty, we can say with confidence that the <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-5-1.html\">sea level is rising</a> and this will increase the risk of coastal flooding in many areas. However, the rate of sea level rise is <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=8875\">dependent on location</a>, and the absolute amount is, again, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/climate/2010/1004/full/climate.2010.30.html\">highly uncertain</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was written by Erica Thompson, Juan Duan and Brian Hoskins of the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/climatechange\">Grantham Institute for Climate Change</a>, <a href=\"http://imperial.ac.uk/\">Imperial College London</a>, in collaboration with the Guardian</em></p> <h2>The ultimate climate change FAQ</h2> <p>\u2022 This answer last updated: 27.09.2012<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/05/ultimate-climate-change-faq\">Read about the project and suggest a question</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/09/climate-faq-report-error\">Report an error in this answer</a></p> <p><strong>Related questions</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/29/intermittant-solar-wind-energy\">Are solar, wind and marine power too intermittent to be useful?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/08/energy-efficiency-carbon-savings\">What's energy efficiency and how much can it help cut emissions?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/21/economists-climate-change-market-failure\">Why do economists describe climate change as a 'market failure'?</a></p> <h2>This editorial is free to reproduce under Creative Commons</h2> <p><br>This post by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">The Guardian</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/uk/\">Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License</a>.<br>Based on a work at <a xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" rel=\"dc:source\">theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/hugo-chavez-wins-venezuelan-election\" title=\"\">won Venezuela's presidential elections</a>, defeating his conservative rival, Henrique Capriles by more than 9% of the vote and guaranteeing a third six-year term as head of the Opec member nation. Turnout was an astounding 80.4% of the electorate.</p> <p>For the past month, this election had been erroneously cast by many as a tightening race between a young and energetic opposition candidate, Capriles, and a sickly, washed-up Ch\u00e1vez whose outdated socialist ideas had finally run their course. The immense support that Ch\u00e1vez still has after 13 years in power is rarely captured accurately by outside accounts of the country.</p> <p>I myself was reminded of this fact just before the elections, when I had the good fortune of sharing a few drinks with a Venezuelan film colleague in a Caracas night spot affectionately referred to by locals, somewhat disconcertingly, as Stab Alley. The district is Chavista turf, miles away from the upper class clubs that attract the city's well-to-do. It was no surprise to see the comandante on the bar's battered television.</p> <p>Our conversation predictably turned to politics. Between sips of Cacique rum, my friend and I went back and forth on a range of topics, I was playing devil's advocate in criticising the government for its paternalism and failure to truly change the country's oil rent economy; he was defending the administration on nearly all fronts.</p> <p>I continued to pigheadedly press my colleague until he starkly turned to me and stated in a rather grave and unsettling tone: \"I would not hesitate to sacrifice my life to defend this president. He's the only one who has done anything for the Venezuelan people.\"</p> <p>This statement, uttered from the mouth of a college-educated Venezuelan worker \u2013 the equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/16/uselections2008-johnmccain-barackobama-debate-joe-the-plumber\" title=\"\">\"Joe the plumber\" in the United States</a> \u2013 took me aback. Gringo that I am, I couldn't fathom taking up arms to defend any politician, ever. So as the discussion came to a relatively awkward end, I was left to contemplate how Ch\u00e1vez, after all these years, could still provoke such die-hard loyalty in his supporters.</p> <p>No one can deny the concrete benefits that many Venezuelans have received since the leader of the nation's \"Bolivarian revolution\" first came to power in 1999. His government has expanded education and healthcare while slashing poverty and writing one of the world's most progressive constitutions. The economy has been good, thanks to high oil prices, and despite the failure to effectively address the question of security and violent crime, the incumbent president can boast of some solid accomplishments.</p> <p>But there is something deeper that has eluded the gaze of outside pundits who for years have portrayed Ch\u00e1vez as either an autocratic dictator or a petrol-rich buffoon. What Ch\u00e1vez is, in fact, is Venezuelan: there is no more authentic a representative of the country's character than him. He is gregarious, loquacious, intensely nationalistic, contradictory, sometimes petulant, and he displays an uncanny, chameleon-like ability to be everything to everyone.</p> <p>Critics describe these traits as simple \"populism\", but Ch\u00e1vez has also done something that no political leader before him has done. Unapologetically, relentlessly, the leftist head of state has succeeded in projecting the image of an independent and sovereign Venezuela onto an international stage. In doing so, he has snapped the tradition of subservience that characterised the nation for decades. This vindication of \"Venezuelan-ness\" on a global scale has been one of his greatest triumphs for a population that has longed to be recognised as being \"just as good\" as northern nations.</p> <p>Of course, there is a strong opposition movement in the country, one that takes the US and Europe as its societal models and who view Ch\u00e1vez with as much repulsion as \"the monkeys who live in the slums\", as a Venezuelan engineer once confided to me. But while there is surely passion on the opposition side, I have yet to encounter the sort of devotion that I have in the Ch\u00e1vez camp. And I certainly have not met anyone who has confessed a willingness to take a bullet for Henrique Capriles.</p>",
  "<p>I didn't always see myself as a lawyer at an international law firm, but that's the path my career has taken. Here are the lessons I learned while at university about securing my future in the legal profession.</p> <p><strong>First year \u2013 do your research and remember your first year grades count</strong></p> <p>Some of my colleagues always wanted to be lawyers. Others, like me, were not so sure. When I started my law degree I knew it would open up lots of opportunities and potential career paths but I didn't really know much about law firms or what life as a lawyer would entail.</p> <p>While researching, I discovered lots of events to help students gain an insight into the legal profession. A friend told me about one that works with students from a variety of different backgrounds who are interested in a legal career. I applied for one and a fantastic opportunity followed where I spent time meeting people from City law firms, visiting their offices and finding out first-hand what it takes to follow in their footsteps.</p> <p>My advice would be to do as much research as possible into the opportunities to learn more about careers in law. Many firms run early insight programmes and open days; attend as many of those as possible. They crystallised my decision to become a lawyer, and gave me a really good insight into what to do next. They also gave me the confidence to apply for vacation schemes. I looked objectively at the criteria \u2013 a strong academic profile and a genuine interest in the law and commerce \u2013 and realised that there is a level playing field if you put yourself forward.</p> <p>It may seem premature to start visiting careers fairs in your first year, but they are a great place to begin your research. Talking to law firm representatives and listening to their presentations will give you a really good insight into whether a career in the law is for you and how to go about getting one; their websites will list when they are planning to visit your campus. If you make a good impression, ask the right questions and build a rapport with the law firm graduate recruitment team members, it can really stand you in good stead (they have great memories).</p> <p>With all the other distractions that university life offers, it's easy to succumb to the perception that your first year exam results don't matter, especially if they don't count towards your overall degree grade. This couldn't be further from the truth if you are thinking about a career in the law. When I came to apply for vacation schemes, I quickly discovered that your first year exam results are very important; they are the most recent academic profile that firms have to go on. If you apply yourself, it should pay off.</p> <p><strong>Second year \u2013 get some experience and a foot in the door</strong></p> <p>If you are serious about a career in law, the best thing you can do is apply for a vacation scheme in your second year at university.</p> <p>Don't be fooled into thinking you have all the time in the world. The sooner you start applying the better. Not only will it give you more time to tailor your application to the firm you are applying to (beyond substituting one law firm name for another), but it's a huge relief to hear that you've secured a place on a vacation scheme before some of your friends have even applied.</p> <p>With so many students boasting a strong academic record, securing a vacation scheme is about more than just exam results. It's important to do something beyond academics to talk about at interview and to prove that you're a well-rounded candidate. I mentored young people through a London School of Economics scheme to help raise young people's aspirations and encourage them to apply to university. It equipped me with useful skills such as problem solving, which I use everyday as a lawyer, and gave me lots of examples to use during the interview process.</p> <p>If you are successful in securing a vacation scheme placement, prepare for the work to be quite different to your degree. I found that my degree mainly focused on theoretical concepts, whereas in practice how to apply the law matters.</p> <p>Also make the most of the opportunities that firms create during this time to talk to lawyers and find out which firm is the place you want to forge your long-term career. My vacation scheme at Freshfields was a good mix of seminars and on-the-job experience. I was given real work to do and had regular contact with a range of lawyers, from trainees to partners. It's not all work though, a lot of effort is put into organising social events. They are a great way to network informally with people who could become colleagues in a few years.</p> <p>Usefully, many law firms give you the opportunity to interview for a training contract place during or shortly after your vacation scheme so treat the whole scheme like an extended interview. Show enthusiasm and the ability to work well in a team and you could turn work experience into a training contract.</p> <p><strong>Third year. Focus on exams and prepare for law school</strong></p> <p>All being well, by the time you get to your third year, you've already got a training contract in the bag. But don't despair if that's not the case. Law firms do take on graduates who have not done a vacation scheme, (there are usually more training contracts available than places on vacation schemes) but obviously the more experience you have to talk about at interview the better.</p> <p><em>Sayo Ogundele is a newly qualified solicitor at </em><a href=\"http://www.freshfields.com/en/global/\" title=\"\"><em>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Few investors would expect a fund management group that boasts a 25-year record in running ethical products to invest in oil and fur, but F&amp;C Investments has been named and shamed in a new report for doing just that.</p> <p>The F&amp;C Stewardship Growth fund, though not alone in doing so, has criteria that enable it to invest in companies engaged in activities that investors might deem unethical, according to a report by specialist independent financial adviser Barchester Green Investment.</p> <p>F&amp;C Stewardship Growth can invest in companies that produce or trade in fur as long as it is \"an insignificant proportion of sales, or is a minor feature on an otherwise non-fur product\". This means the manager of the \u00a3505m fund can invest in the likes of Burberry (currently 1.6% of the F&amp;C fund) which has faced a barrage of criticism on its fur activities from animal rights groups such as Peta.</p> <p>F&amp;C appears in Barchester's annual \"winners and spinners\" list, detailing the heroes and villains of the ethical investment world. Barchester's managing partner John Ditchfield has also identified Henderson after it replaced a successful socially responsible investment (SRI) team with professionals who have \"no experience of integrating ethical and environmental considerations into their investment process\".</p> <p>Ditchfield is also unhappy about Ecclesiastical Amity International, which screens out companies earning more than 10% of their pre-tax profits or turnover from the likes of alcohol production or arms. The firm invests in US giant GE, which supplies engines for military planes and helicopters. GE's armaments business \"only\" contributes 0.5% to GE's turnover, but because of the sheer size of the company that equates to about $830m a year.</p> <p>Ecclesiastical also holds an investment trust in its portfolio that owns tobacco companies - despite winning a Moneyfacts award for Best Ethical Investment Provider last month. \"It's ridiculous that Ecclesiastical can win an award like that at the same time as having a 10% screen that allows it to invest in tobacco firms and arms. That's the letter but not in the spirit of what ethical investors want to achieve. Investors don't want to be a bit ethical, in the same way that you can't be a bit pregnant.\"</p> <p>Neville White, senior SRI analyst at Ecclesiastical, said: \"Our published ethical investment policy and screening criteria are clearly articulated for the market. In the case of GE and the JP Morgan Japanese Investment Trust, these holdings fall well within our stated threshold levels for allowable investment.</p> <p>\"As well as our exclusion policy, we also look to apply a positive screen whereby we seek to invest in companies making a positive contribution to society.</p> <p>\"In the case of GE, they have a number of industry-leading initiatives in place, including their Ecomagination sustainable technology programme.</p> <p>\"Our ethical policy may not be a perfect fit for all investors. However, we believe our rigorous ethical investment process makes our funds market leaders and a responsible choice for investors looking for profits with principles.\"</p> <p>Ditchfield calls F&amp;C's holding of Burberry and a tar sands firm \"disappointing\" and claims the culling of Henderson's experienced SRI team is \"a major change to the fundamental nature of the product that was not communicated to investors in a way which allowed them to reach a proper decision\".</p> <p>A spokesman for F&amp;C said it had tightened its criteria in early 2012, reducing the threshold at which it would accept a company manufacturing or selling fur from 3% of that company's revenue to 1% (Burberry derives about 0.2% of revenue from fur). Similarly, it recently introduced a threshold on tar sands of 3% of a company's revenue where it previously had no clause at all.</p> <p>Environmentalists claim that extracting oil from tar sands is particularly harmful because of its energy inefficiency and damage to landscapes.</p> <p>The spokesman added: \"We have a stronger process than anyone else, with an independent committee that questions every single stock put in front of them. We haven't watered down our ethical criteria - if anything we've made it more rigorous. Yes, Burberry is a high-profile stock, but it sells a trivial amount of fur products.\"</p> <p>The F&amp;C spokesman added: \"We have a zero tolerance approach to areas such as weapons and alcohol. But every investor has different ideas about screening criteria and if we listened to every single one of them individually, we wouldn't be able to invest in anything.\"</p> <p>In the run up to National Ethical Investment week, 14-20 October, investors will once again be questioning the criteria used by investment managers and asking whether truly ethical funds can deliver decent returns. Ditchfield believes they can, and remains enthusiastic about the sector.</p> <p>The best UK-focused ethical fund - CIS Sustainable Leaders Trust - delivered a return of 25% over 12 months, while Standard Life UK Ethical Fund generated 43.5% over three years. This more than outperforms the UK All Companies sector average of 18.7% over one year and 29.6% over three years, and perhaps explains why there is now about \u00a311.2bn invested across the 60-odd ethical and environmental funds open to UK investors.</p> <p>Barchester says the popularity of ethical funds will increase, partly as a result of \"strong financial returns being delivered by many ethical funds\" but also due to banking scandals and poor returns offered by banks turning savers into ethical investors. However, he doesn't believe ethical funds will stop investing in banks - most ethical funds hold global banks in their portfolio and if they were unable to do so, performance could suffer.</p> <p>Barchester Green names WHEB Asset Management's IM WHEB Sustainability Fund as a winner because, despite poor recent performance (6.7% in the last year and a fall over three years), it has snapped up Henderson's SRI team at a cost of about \u00a32m, showing a huge commitment to the sector. Ditchfield also likes Cheviot Asset Management's Climate Asset Fund because it \"uses a multi asset mix [of bonds and equities] to stabilise customer returns\".</p> <p>Other winners include Triodos Bank, which Ditchfield says is \"an ethical thought leader and continues to make a substantial contribution to the growth of responsible finance in the UK\". He also believes Kames Ethical Cautious Managed is a winner, despite the fact it invests in oil companies: \"The difference is that it engages actively with the companies it invests in, even giving investors information on its voting history at shareholder AGMs.\"</p> <p>That said, Ditchfield does not believe \"engagement\" - the idea that you can effect positive change at an unethical company by being a campaigning shareholder - really works \"because ethical funds just aren't big enough. Maybe if you held 10% of a huge mining company you could tell its board to stop exploiting child workers overseas, but our ethical funds just aren't big enough.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 Understand the investments that best suit your needs with </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianinvesting.co.uk/tools_and_calculators/\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Investing: financial tools and calculators</em></a></p>",
  "<p>American companies and its government should avoid doing business with China's two leading technology firms, Huawei and ZTE, because they pose a national security threat to the US, the House of Representatives' intelligence committee will warn in a report to be published on Monday.</p> <p>The Republican-controlled panel also says US regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the US by the two companies, which are among the world's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones.</p> <p>The panel's report will cause transatlantic friction over the role of the Chinese companies. In the UK, Huawei is a major supplier to the telecoms provider BT, and has supplied infrastructure being used in the new 4G superfast mobile network built by Everything Everywhere \u2013 the merged Orange/T-Mobile. Huawei provides access to its source code for GCHQ specialists who have reportedly examined it for threats and passed it as safe for use.</p> <p>Huawei is a private company founded by a former Chinese military engineer, and has grown rapidly to become the world's second largest supplier, behind Sweden's Ericsson, of telecommunications network gear, with operations in more than 140 countries. ZTE is the world's fourth largest mobile phone manufacturer, with 90,000 employees worldwide, and fifth-largest maker of telecoms equipment.</p> <p>While both companies' sales of mobile devices such as smartphones have grown in the US, espionage fears have proscribed any move into network infrastructure sales.</p> <p>ZTE has also enjoyed growth in its sale of mobile devices, although in recent months it has faced allegations about banned sales of US-sanctioned computer equipment to Iran. The FBI is probing reports that the company obstructed a US Commerce Department investigation into the sales.</p> <p>The intelligence panel says ZTE refused to provide any documents on its activities in Iran, but did provide a list of 19 individuals who serve on the Chinese communist party committee within the company. ZTE's citing of China's state secrecy laws for limiting information it could release only added to concern over Chinese government influence over its operations, the report says.</p> <p>Reflecting growing US governmental and commercial concern over cyber-attacks traced to China, the report also recommends that US government computer systems not include any components from the two firms because that could pose an espionage risk.</p> <p>\"China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,\" the report says. It also raises the diplomatic temperature by warning that \"Huawei and ZTE have failed to assuage the committee's significant security concerns presented by their continued expansion into the US \u2026 In fact, given their obstructionist behaviour, the committee believes addressing these concerns have become an imperative for the country.\"</p> <p>But Huawei's US vice-president for external affairs, William Plummer, hit back: \"Baseless suggestions otherwise or purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignore technical and commercial realities, recklessly threaten American jobs and innovation, do nothing to protect national security, and should be exposed as dangerous political distractions from legitimate public-private initiatives to address what are global and industry-wide cyber challenges,\" he said. Huawei is a \"globally trusted and respected company,\" he said, insisting that it had cooperated with investigators.</p> <p>ZTE said it \"profoundly disagrees\" with the committee's claims: \"ZTE should not be a focus of this investigation to the exclusion of the much larger western vendors,\" it commented in an open letter.</p> <p>The recommendations are the result of a year-long probe, including a congressional hearing last month in which senior Chinese executives of both companies testified, and denied posing a security threat. The most recent hearing, in September, was titled <a href=\"http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/hpsci-hold-open-hearing-national-security-threats-posed-huawei-and-zte\" title=\"\">\"Open hearing on national security threats posted by Huawei and ZTE\"</a>.</p> <p>The bipartisan report is likely to become fodder for a presidential campaign in which the candidates have been competing over their readiness to clamp down on Chinese trade violations. The Republican candidate Mitt Romney, in particular, has made it a key point to get tougher on China by designating it a currency manipulator and fighting abuses such as intellectual property theft.</p> <p>The committee made the draft available to reporters and wire services in advance of public release on Monday, but only under the condition that they not publish stories until the broadcast Sunday of a CBS 60 Minutes report on Huawei. In the CBS report, the committee's chairman, Republican Rep Mike Rogers, urged American companies not to do business with Huawei.</p> <p>\"Find another vendor [than Huawei] if you care about your intellectual property; if you care about your consumers' privacy and you care about the national security of the United States of America,\" Rogers said in comments broadcast on the programme.</p> <p>The panel's recommendations are likely hamper Huawei and ZTE's ambitions to expand their business in the US. Their products are used in scores of countries, including in the west. Both deny being influenced by China's communist government.</p> <p>\"The investigation concludes that the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to US critical infrastructure could undermine core US national-security interests,\" the report says.</p> <p>The report says the committee received information from industry experts and current and former Huawei employees suggesting that Huawei, in particular, may be violating US laws. It says that the committee will refer the allegations to the US government for further review and possible investigation. The report mentions allegations of immigration violations, bribery and corruption, and of a \"pattern and practice\" of Huawei using pirated software in its US facilities.</p> <p>An unclassified version of the report will be released at 15:00 BST, though a classified annex with \"significantly more information adding to the committee's concerns\" will remain redacted.</p> <p>Similar concerns have led <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/29/huawei-ban-cyber-cold-war\" title=\"\">the Australian government to ban Huawei</a> from bidding as a supplier to the A$38bn National Broadband Network (NBN). And in November 2011, the US online security company Symantec dissolved a joint venture in which it was the 49% minority partner with Huawei because it feared being shut out of US government business.</p> <p>However, \"Huawei has not and will not jeopardize our global commercial success nor the integrity of our customers' networks for any third party, government or otherwise,\" senior vice-president Charles Ding testified to the committee in September, suggesting it would be corporate suicide to do so.</p> <p>The report says the companies failed to provide responsive answers about their relationships and support by the Chinese government, and detailed information about their operations in the US. Huawei, in particular, is criticised for failing to provide thorough information, including on its corporate structure, history, financial arrangements and management.</p> <p>\"The committee finds that the companies failed to provide evidence that would satisfy any fair and full investigation. Although this alone does not prove wrongdoing, it factors into the committee's conclusions,\" it says.</p> <p>In Washington, Huawei executive Plummer said on Friday that the company co-operated in good faith with the investigation, which he said had not been objective and amounted to a \"political distraction\" from cybersecurity problems facing the entire industry.</p> <p>All major telecommunications firms, including those in the west, develop and manufacture equipment in China and overlapping supply chains require industry-wide solutions, he added. Singling out China-based firms wouldn't help.</p> <p>Plummer complained that the volume of information sought by the committee was unreasonable, and it had demanded some proprietary business information that \"no responsible company\" would provide.</p> <p>In justifying its scrutiny of the Chinese companies, the committee contended that Chinese intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, often recruit those with direct access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets and other sensitive proprietary data.</p> <p>It warned that malicious hardware or software implants in Chinese-manufactured telecommunications components and systems headed for US customers could allow Beijing to shut down or degrade critical national security systems in a time of crisis or war.</p> <p>The committee concluded that Huawei likely has substantially benefited from the support of the Chinese government.</p> <p>Huawei denies being financed to undertake research and development for the Chinese military, but the committee says it has received internal Huawei documentation from former employees showing the company provides special network services to an entity alleged to be an elite cyberwarfare unit within the People's Liberation Army.</p> <p>The intelligence committee recommended that the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, bar mergers and acquisitions by both Huawei and ZTE. CFIUS is a multi-agency regulatory panel chaired by treasury secretary Timothy Geithner, and screens foreign investment proposals for potential national security threats.</p> <p>Last year, Huawei had to unwind its purchase of a US computer company, 3Leaf Systems, after it failed to win CFIUS approval. However, Huawei employs 1,700 people in the US, and business is expanding. US revenues rose to $1.3bn in 2011, up from $765m in 2010.</p>",

It would be difficult to imagine a more <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize\">prestigious award</a> a human can receive, given that they are presented to people who have achieved genuine cultural advances beyond those of their peers in the fields of science, literature, economics and the pursuit of peace, as judged by a panel of highly qualified experts.</p> <p>Let's be clear, a sob story won't help you win a Nobel, and there's no premium rate phone number to register your vote.</p> <p>The selection process is kept tightly under wraps, usually the only people to know they were even in the running are the winners when their name is read out at the ceremony, which may explain why Barack Obama and everyone else seemed so surprised when he was awarded the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1929447,00.html\">peace prize in 2009</a>. I remember his press conference when it was announced; he looked like a man who'd wandered into the wrong wedding but somehow ended up doing the best man's speech.</p> <p>So this isn't like the Oscars, the shortlist isn't known for months in advance. You also don't get extensive media coverage of potential winners arriving, with several channels discussing who has<a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/2011-oscars-red-carpet-162105\"> turned up wearing the most glamorous lab coat</a>. But that doesn't mean you can't make predictions as to the likely winners. The information is all out there, you just need to look for it. So, based on my own research and gut instinct, here are my predictions for the Nobel Prizes, 2012</p> <p><strong>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</strong></p> <p>An interesting field, as human health is of paramount importance to so many. One potential winner could be <a href=\"http://simonsingh.net/\">Simon Singh</a>, who has repeatedly furthered the understanding of medicine simply by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2010/apr/15/simon-singh-libel-case-dropped\">making</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/oct/03/health-magazine-sue-simon-singh-twitter\">statements</a>. However, these awards should go to the truly groundbreaking, and for that it must go to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Wolf\">Naomi Wolf</a>, for her discovery of the vagina-brain connection. In her recent book, Wolf has revealed that, in women, the brain and the vagina are <a href=\"http://neurocritic.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/feminist-dopamine-conscious-vaginas-and.html\">directly associated via a number of pathways,</a> and a woman's consciousness and mental ability are dependent on the functioning of her vagina. This is a physiological system that was previously unknown to medical science, so will no doubt lead to considerable advances in the field of health care and study, and possibly to some women taking prescriptions to Ann Summers. Wolf's theories have been <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/sci-tech/2012/09/naomi-wolfs-brain?quicktabs_most_read=1\">criticised</a><a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/naom-wolfs-vagina-the-perils-of-neuroself-help/\"> extensively</a>, but they must be accurate as they have been published, so what further proof is needed?</p> <p>Partial acknowledgment must also go to my friend and guest blogger <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/david-steele\">Dave Steele</a>, for coining the term \"the Gynapse\". </p> <p><strong>Nobel Prize in Physics</strong></p> <p>With the popularity of physics expanding like a post-<a href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-powered-the-big-bang/\">Big Bang</a> universe (not that there's any other kind I can think of), the physics prize has the potential to receive the most attention. And when you think of 'Physics' and 'Media attention', the first name that comes to mind is usually <a href=\"http://www.apolloschildren.com/brian/\">Professor Brian Cox</a>. But 2012 saw a sudden and intense focus on a groundbreaking moment in history, and this was to do with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-18702455\">Higgs Boson</a>. So much<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/large_hadron_collider/index.html\"> time, energy and resources </a>via so many individuals were focussed onto the search for the Higgs, and physics knowledge was seriously increased as a result, so I predict the Nobel Prize for physics will be awarded to the Higgs Boson. </p> <p>Arguably, seeing as individuals have mass and the Higgs imparts mass, whoever wins, the Higgs Boson will \"receive\" the award. But by naming the Higgs itself as the winner, maybe it will reveal itself in order to accept the award, and if it does this in a room filled with the world's leading physicists, this should result in a greater understanding of what it is and how it works.</p> <p><strong>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</strong></p> <p>Chemistry may not be as publicly popular as Physics, but it still underpins pretty much <a href=\"http://chemistry.about.com/od/everydaychemistry/Chemistry_in_Everyday_Life.htm\">every aspect of our lives</a>, so much so that a Nobel should be given to anyone who can demonstrably create a product <a href=\"http://www.geekosystem.com/chemistry-set-no-chemicals/\">without chemicals</a>. Such claims are <a href=\"http://fnochemicalfree.tumblr.com/\">invariably ludicrous</a>, though. But there has been at least one major high-profile advance in 2012 in the field of chemistry, so the Nobel Prize should go to whoever developed Esso's fuel, which <a href=\"http://fuelprogress.co.uk/#p0\">works at the molecular level</a>. Given that all fossil fuel use is<a href=\"http://www.wou.edu/las/physci/GS361/Energy_From_Fossil_Fuels.htm\"> dependent on chemical reactions,</a> ergo works at the molecular level, the people at Esso must have devised a whole new system of obtaining energy from molecules, otherwise why would they point it out? Maybe the petrol molecules attach nanoscopic treadmills to the engine's moving parts and run on them to produce mechanical energy? I don't know, but they should find whoever is responsible and give him/her/them the prize, for changing the game for us all.</p> <p><strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong></p> <p>In these times when conflict and strife are a daily occurrence in the news, it's hard to think of anyone who has made a high-profile demonstration of peaceful intent. But it's one thing to push for peace and diplomacy, it's another thing to show a peaceful intention when everything about you suggests anything but. This is why the Nobel Peace Prize should go to the Mars <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/curiosity-rover\">Curiosity Rover</a>, for <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/20120809-curiosity-comes-cheap.html\">blazing uninvited</a> into an <a href=\"http://news.softpedia.com/news/Mars-A-Frozen-Lifeless-Desert-5260.shtml\">impoverished region</a> riding over <a href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/20120809-curiosity-comes-cheap.html\">2 billion dollar's</a> worth of high-tech American ordinance, and doing nothing more aggressive than stroll around<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/28/curiosity-finds-ancient-riverbed-mars\"> taking pictures.</a> For this noble example, the Rover itself should get the prize. Exactly how it would get to the ceremony is another matter.</p> <p><strong>Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel</strong></p> <p>Economics has been in apparent chaos since the credit crunch, so it's hard to make out any genuine achievement from all the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/06/financial-crisis-25-people-heart-meltdown\">meltdowns</a>. Most politicians have their fingers so far in their ears about the economy that if they pulled them out you could see through their heads, so even supposed \"experts\" seem<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jul/25/george-osborne-defends-recession-deepens\"> completely clueless.</a> It would be tempting to suggest my usual bugbears like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/aug/16/antidote-celebrities-promote-homeopathy\">homeopaths</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/brain-flapping/2012/sep/13/wrinkle-cream-scientific-evidence\">beauty industry</a> should be awarded for their ability to get money for nothing, but that's not really an achievement, per se. So I predict that the 2012 prize for Economics will go to nobody, and the million dollar prize fund will rollover to 2013. Given how the economic climate is going, by 2013 the only way to make any real money in economics will be to actually win this prize, meaning everyone will start trying to improve the economy to win it. This will mean that the most deserving of this prize will be the ones who instigate these improvements, so the prize will go to the Nobel academy, meaning it's all a cunning plan on their part.</p> <p>Unless economics and economic sciences are different things, in which case, ignore the above.</p> <p><strong>Nobel Prize in Literature</strong></p> <p>With the advances in eBooks and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/self-publishing\">self publishing</a>, it takes more effort than ever to stand out in the field of literature. One possible consideration for the Nobel Prize is E.L. James, for achieving a literature paradox by writing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifty-Shades-Grey-L-James/dp/0099579936\">50 Shades of Grey</a>, one of the most popular books in recent years that is apparently loathed by everyone.

  "<p>Rose Molokoane, who helps allocate millions of dollars to urban improvement projects around the world, lives in a South African informal settlement. She has spent more than 20 years organising urban poor communities, helping them to pool savings and obtain land and housing. Molokoane is also a prominent member of <a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/upfi/\" title=\"\">Urban Poor Fund International</a>, the first global fund to give poor people direct control over development spending in cities.</p> <p>\"We are sick and tired of becoming the objects of development,\" she told an audience at a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/22393343\" title=\"\">conference in Brazil</a> last year. \"We want to build our own destiny.\"</p> <p>The fund was launched in 2007 by <a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/\" title=\"\">Shack/Slum Dwellers International</a> (SDI), a network of community-based federations in 33 countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America. Since then, it has channelled more than $17.8m (\u00a311m) in capital and technical assistance to more than 150 community-run projects in cities.</p> <p>The innovative fund lets poor communities define development strategies and manage capital from neighbourhood to global level. Urban poor federations and supporting NGOs in the network submit proposals for community projects, which are evaluated by a council of long-time federation leaders, including Molokoane. Money allocated is accompanied by strategic advice from a board of government ministers.</p> <p>Resources flow through national funds to local savings collectives, mostly made up of women, that contribute their share and implement projects. Recouped money feeds back to a national revolving account. Ultimately, the goal is to create a robust network of national funds that can independently attract government and private-sector investment and help shape urban development agendas.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/media/upload/documents/UPFIAnnualReport2011.pdf\" title=\"\">The fund has financed</a> (pdf) the construction of 50,000 homes, secured tenure for 20,000 families, and supported projects in 18 countries. Without high overheads or fancy consultants, it has directly benefited poor families.</p> <p>While the tangible outputs are impressive, the greatest gains don't fit neatly into a spreadsheet. Unlike most development financing, the fund invests as much in social processes as physical projects. By supporting strategies like learning exchanges and community-based surveys, it helps urban poor groups build skills and connections across cities, regions and continents.</p> <p>The fund also allows poor communities to attract external resources and make a political impact. Capital helps federations leverage finance from governments, banks and donors, while demonstration projects encourage broader investment or policy shifts. For example, projects have produced pro-poor changes in building regulations and attracted state housing subsidies. The fund also helps give poor groups a voice in municipalities and international circles. The bottom line is not full cost-recovery for atomised projects on three-year timetables; it is long-term political transformation.</p> <p>The benefits of this financing model were evident in Mukuru Sinai, an informal settlement hugging an oil pipeline in Nairobi's industrial zone. In 2009, the fund awarded $315,000 to a savings collective of 2,000 families who, renting homes on private land there, suffered constant threats of eviction and gas explosions. Armed with capital, they got a bank loan to buy 23 acres of nearby land for just over $1m, and a government pledge to provide infrastructure. Tenants are now drawing up plans to build homes, partly subsidised by developing for-sale housing on the plot. Leaders are hopeful not only that the project becomes a pilot for other informal settlements on private land in Nairobi, but also that locals will share lessons with communities in Kenya and beyond.</p> <p>The cost-effectiveness and broad impact of this financing model points to the need for placing urban poor communities at the helm of development spending in cities. \"All successful urban initiatives have been ones that have placed people's knowledge and people's action at the centre of the process,\" says Diana Mitlin, a researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> who has worked with SDI for more than a decade. \"That doesn't mean professionals are not needed, but it means professionals acknowledge the limitations of their role.\"</p> <p>Despite its success, the model faces challenges. The international fund needs to attract money, because it does not recover investments. But many donors either lack understanding of the fund's innovative strategy or consider it too risky.</p> <p>\"It's much easier to cushion yourself behind different agencies and make sure you get your money back,\" says SDI co-ordinator Celine D'Cruz. \"It's much more risky to give the money straight to the mouth of the tiger. But that is exactly where the real change is meant to happen.\"</p> <p>Leveraging external resources and getting cities to partner with urban poor groups is also a challenge. Success stories abound, but in many places there is a long path from occasional compromises to lasting partnerships and policy changes.</p> <p>The fund's success also depends on strong community organisations. Many SDI affiliates have mobilised for decades, but newer members require time to ensure that individual projects yield stable federations and political gains. The organisation's network extends to 388 cities and expands constantly, but the fund remains limited if only member groups have access.</p> <p>To make a bigger impact, D'Cruz believes urban poor funds must be established on a city scale, governed by community leaders, civil society groups and city officials, and implemented with a strong community base.</p> <p>\"That would be a dream,\" D'Cruz says. \"And actually, it's such a simple solution. It cuts through all the red tape.\"</p>",
