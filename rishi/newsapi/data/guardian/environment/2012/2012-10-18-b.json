  "<p>Microsoft has suffered a worse than expected 24% fall in profits, but chief executive Steven Ballmer countered by promising a \"new era\" for the world's largest software company as it prepares to fight for a share of the mobile computing goldrush with next week's launch of Windows 8.</p> <p>Wall Street was braced for a contraction after news that PC sales were down 8% in a quarter as consumer spending switches from the desktop to tablets and phones.</p> <p>Microsoft obliged by announcing a year-on-year fall in first quarter profits before tax from $7.3bn (\u00a34.5bn) to $5.5bn and revenues of $16 billion, the lowest reported since March 2010. Income from its Windows division fell to $3.2bn, the worst performance in three years.</p> <p>The best selling software's most radical redesign since Windows 95 has seen its interface reinvented for the touch screen, and its arrival today will be accompanied by the launch of the Surface tablet, Microsoft's answer to the iPad.</p> <p>\"The launch of Windows 8 is the beginning of a new era at Microsoft,\" said Ballmer. \"Investments we've made over a number of years are now coming together to create a future of exceptional devices and services.\"</p> <p>On Monday 29 October, Microsoft will make a concerted push into the smartphone industry with the unveiling of Windows Phone 8. Its arrival will be followed in November by new handsets using the operating system from Finland's Nokia and Taiwan's HTC.</p> <p>It is an alliance that spans three continents, and to which the fortunes of all three companies are closely tied. Admitting the PC market was \"challenging\", Microsoft finance director Peter Klein said the company was preparing for the \"largest launch wave in our history\".</p> <p>Revenues from other divisions have held up, with sales of servers and tools rising 8% to $4.5bn, while the Xbox games console helped revenues from entertainment and devices hold firm at $1.9bn.</p> <p>The number of calls on Skype, the online phonebox acquired by Microsoft last year, rocketed 58% to 120bn minutes.</p> <p>\"Investors were not expecting a home run,\" said analyst Daniel Ives at FBR Capital Markets. \"All expectations are on the launch of Windows 8 and the entrance into the tablet market. In light of the environment, the macro and PC situation, these are respectable numbers.\"</p> <p>Nokia will be hoping Microsoft's Windows marketing push delivers an uplift for its beleaguered smartphone business. Announcing results for the three months to 30 September, the Finnish group revealed on Thursday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/18/nokia-struggles-to-keep-pace-with-apple-samsung\" title=\"\">it has burned through \u20ac633m (\u00a3514m) of cash in three months</a>, with sales falling by 20% in a year, thanks to sluggish demand for its smartphones and a near \u20ac1bn collapse in takings from China.</p> <p>Nokia has spent almost a third of its cash reserves in 12 months, and has \u20ac3.6bn left to fund its transformation into a smartphone maker capable of competing with Apple and Samsung. At its current rate of spending, those reserves will have vanished by March 2014.</p> <p>\"The big investor concern is that Nokia might run out of cash before Windows phone builds a successful following,\" said analyst Mark Sue at RBC Capital markets.</p> <p>Nokia has lost almost 90% of its value since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. Yesterday it reported its sixth straight quarter of losses since dumping its own Symbian phone software and adopting Microsoft's Windows Phone.</p> <p>Third quarter sales fell to \u20ac7.2bn, better than analysts were forecasting but down from nearly \u00a39bn in the third quarter of 2011, as smartphone shipments withered by 10m to 6.3m units. Overall shipments fell 22% to 83m, with only 300,000 phones sold in North America.</p> <p>Shipments of Lumia smartphones fell to 2.9m units from 4m in the second quarter.</p> <p>Customers have stayed away because only the new Lumia models, which Elop confirmed would be released in a \"select\" number of markets in November, will be able to run Windows 8.</p> <p>The decision to push Lumia in just a few markets before Christmas means Nokia can concentrate its marketing firepower, but the company warned fourth quarter smartphone volumes would not see the usual seasonal uplift.</p> <p>There was a silver lining in the form of a turnaround at Nokia Siemens Networks. The telecoms equipment maker swung back into profit after making more than 14,000 job cuts to concentrate on mobile rather than fixed line networks.</p> <p>Nokia will benefit from the fact that mobile networks are keen to see an alternative to Android and Apple emerge, Elop said. \"We are seeing increasing concern among operators about the concentration of power that is landing with two particular ecosystems that are out there today,\" he told analysts on a conference call. \"You are going to see operators in the West beginning to say we need a third ecosystem.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 We have had reason to speak in the recent past of Oliver Letwin, the government's chief thinker/philosopher. Who can forget that memorable occasion when he was caught throwing constituents' letters into a park bin. Or his mauling by Bernard Jenkin, who said that his Tory colleague <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/20/hugh-muir-diary-russia-putin-friends\" title=\"\">didn't know what he was talking about</a>. Well Olly's back, older; no wiser \u2013 and this time his travels take him to a primary school where <a href=\"http://www.viewfrompublishing.co.uk/news_view/22561/7/1/bridport-mp-shocks-children-with-views-on\" title=\"\">pupils seek counsel from their MP on cycling safety for children</a>. \"I must tell you that I am against legislation that would make wearing cycle helmets compulsory. I think things like that should be down to the individual,\" Olly tells the 10- and 11-year-olds. \"I personally don't think that wearing seat belts in cars or wearing helmets on motorbikes should be compulsory either.\" We are not advocating forcing everyone, protests one pupil, only children. \"I think people of nine or 10 can make these decisions for themselves,\" counters Olly. \"Do you care at all about children's lives?\" asks an outraged pupil. Of course, says Olly, but a free life comes with \"a certain amount of risk\". Years of road safety advice and policy, dismissed in an instant by the brain at the heart of the coalition. Still, if they had wanted good sense, they would have called on someone else.</p> <p>\u2022 Lord Marland perhaps. He's a fount of wisdom and humour. This week he told peers he was using a taxpayer-funded trip to sub-Saharan Africa to \"keep the suntan up\". The Daily Mail, as one might guess, did not approve. \"Extraordinary boast made by David Cameron's new trade minister,\" was its early take. But then the anger subsided. Maybe someone helped to calm things down. For yesterday when one looked for the story on Mail Online, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2218993/Lord-Marland-I-just-trying-sun-tan-Extraordinary-boast-David-Camerons-new-trade-minister-jetted-Africa.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">it simply wasn't there</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 Did someone intervene? Prince Charles, maybe. He has a view on most things and he is not afraid to convey it; even if <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/17/prince-charles-policy-britain-run\" title=\"\">he is wary of letting the public know what it is</a>. The prince has fingers in many pies, and one of them is Prime \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.prime.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise</a>. It is, the website says, \"the only national organisation dedicated to providing everyone over 50, who is unemployed or under threat of redundancy, with the support to achieve financial, social and personal fulfilment\". Over 50? Facing redundancy? Charles is 64 this year.</p> <p>\u2022 To company news, and let's check the fortunes of Elbrus Consultants Ltd. The accounts for February 2011 to February 2012 reach us. We are underwhelmed. The company has \u00a314,448 in the bank, and is owed another \u00a316,200, but owes \u00a326,194. Thus its assets, less liabilities, amount to \u00a34,454. Nothing to bother Bill Gates or interest Warren Buffett. Still, it's early days, and there is an argument that Elbrus director Andy Coulson may have been distracted by this and that over the reporting period. Police investigations, criminal proceedings, Leveson. There's no Peston here, but we see three possibilities: things may pick up, get worse, or stay the same.</p> <p>\u2022 And chancellor George Osborne is in big trouble for apparently <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/greenpolitics/9617946/Environment-groups-challenge-George-Osborne-over-deeply-offensive-Taliban-slur-claims.html\" title=\"\">referring to climate change protesters as the \"environmental Taliban\"</a>. An extraordinary comment for a senior member of Big Dave's \"greenest government ever\". Still, George never was bound by decent convention. It all rings true, for we are told that the Osbornites have developed a robust enthusiasm for fracking. It has become their litmus test of environmental credibility. \"The view is that if you are in favour of fracking, you have the balls for the fight. If you're against, you're not worth bothering with,\" a source tells us. A Taliban-like inflexibility, don't you think?</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, here comes the cavalry. \"Why doesn't anyone stand up for Jimmy Savile?\" asks Charles Moore in the Spectator. \"Is there no priest who will testify that the man was a repentant sinner, no unmolested child grateful that Jim Fixed It for him? Sir Jimmy should keep his knighthood.\" Abuse will be hard to prove. And \"if you insist on sucking up to these Pied Pipers of our age, you take the consequences when one of them leads the kiddies off under the hill.\" We await the petition.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Even given his own talent for hyperbole, the claim George Galloway made on <a href=\"http://www.respectparty.org/2012/10/galloway-to-demand-home-secretary-acts.html\" title=\"\">Sunday night</a> was extraordinary: that he had discovered his secretary was working as an \"agent\" for a Metropolitan police counterterrorism officer who was running a \"dirty tricks\" campaign against him.</p> <p>It was a serious allegation. \"A direct attack on not just me but on democracy,\" the MP said. He complained to the police, who promised an investigation, voluntarily referring the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. And he <a href=\"http://www.respectparty.org/2012/10/galloway-demands-home-secretary.html\" title=\"\">wrote to Theresa May, the home secretary,</a> demanding an inquiry, saying he had \"incontrovertible evidence\" that the duo had set up fake email addresses to spread \"rumour, disinformation and downright lies\".</p> <p>But Galloway's now former secretary, Aisha Ali-Khan, is fighting back. She says she is married to Afiz Khan, whom Galloway correctly identified as a detective inspector in the Met's counter-terrorism unit, SO15.</p> <p>She says the two wed in a Muslim ceremony in 2009 and have had an on-off, hush-hush relationship ever since. She is furious that their relationship is being presented as somehow illicit.</p> <p>\"Not only have I lost my job and my credibility but I've been branded this tart sleeping with random police officers.\"</p> <p>Suspended on full pay but not expecting her job back, Ali-Khan has filed a complaint with the Met, accusing Galloway of either hacking into her private emails or ordering someone else to do so. She believes there can be no other explanation for how he was able to quote verbatim, in his letter to May, from emails she and her husband had written to each other. Galloway says he was given the emails by his lawyer.</p> <p>Ali-Khan believes she has been \"thrown to the wolves\" because she was disliked by certain male figures in Bradford's Respect party who wanted her out, and because Galloway wanted to deflect attention from a story about his personal life which he believed was about to hit the papers.</p> <p>She says Galloway must have known about the marriage \u2013 she listed Khan as her spouse on the security clearance questionnaire she filled in to gain a parliamentary pass when she began her job in April, after Galloway's sensational win for Respect in the Bradford West byelection. Her marriage certificate was included in the forms Galloway signed.</p> <p>\"If I signed a questionnaire, I would not have read who her husband was,\" said Galloway on Thursday, insisting he had once been introduced to a different man in Bradford who Ali-Khan said was her estranged husband, presumably the father of her nine-year-old son. \"If I had read it, I would have assumed it was the person I met in Bradford.\"</p> <p>Ali-Khan, a trained teacher who gave up her job mentoring young Muslims in order to work for Galloway, says she was upfront about her spouse's sensitive day job in the Muslim contact unit. \"It was never an issue,\" she insisted.</p> <p>Galloway has claimed that the couple \"had been sleeping in my house, and without permission, while I was abroad\". He says he discovered this following a break-in, when Ali-Khan's parliamentary laptop was stolen from Galloway's home in Streatham, south London, where she lived for a few months while the constituency office was being set up in Bradford.</p> <p>\"[Khan] had to tell the officers investigating the burglary that his fingerprints would be found in the house. I asked the local officers informally to report on this to his bosses. I heard no more and neither have I heard any more about the burglary. I should, of course, have dismissed [Ali-Khan] but foolishly I gave her a second chance,\" he wrote in his letter to May.</p> <p>Ali-Khan insists Khan never slept in the house, but simply \"popped in to use the loo\" one night before the break-in, and so warned officers investigating that they might find his prints. She says the emails Galloway has seized on as evidence of a plot against him are nothing of the sort. And that far from showing a police handler and his spy, they show a couple making \"silly jokes\".</p> <p>Galloway has pointed to one particular email as proof of foul play, in which Khan used his police account to tell Ali-Khan: \"I think there was an election fraud. I found out the printer of the election voting cards is a member of Respect. The postman for the postal votes was also a member of Respect party. And finally there was a rush of new voters with the name of Ali. There were 450 voters apparently all staying at the Midland. And finally the gypsies came in to support GG via the Westfield site.\"</p> <p>Ali-Khan dismisses any talk of conspiracy, saying this was an example of a number of \"running jokes\" the couple shared about conspiracy-prone Respect, the ubiquity of her maiden name (Ali) and the fact that party activists spent weeks camped out in caravans at the building site where a Westfield shopping centre was supposed to be built.</p> <p>She admitted asking Khan to set up a fake email address so that she could email the Guardian when she found out the paper was planning to do a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/14/george-galloway-losing-respect-bradford\" title=\"\">report on Galloway and Respect six months on from the byelection</a> victory. He did it for her, she says, \"because I'm not that literate with computers\". (A \"laughable\" claim, according to Galloway.)</p> <p>After Galloway's claims about the secret police investigation, the Guardian asked to see the \"incontrovertible evidence\" about the spy plot. His office sent over five screen grabs showing email conversations between Ali-Khan and Khan, who used both his police address and a Hotmail account. The screen grabs did not show the complete conversations, making it impossible to establish the context in which the remarks were being made. Ali-Khan claimed Galloway had deliberately shorn them of their context in order to present the conspiracy theory which would get him the sort of media attention he craves.</p> <p>One message, entitled \"update\", has been described by Galloway as \"an extensive email on tactics she should employ and which defamed several members of staff and volunteers\". Ali-Khan says the message is her husband giving her a pep talk after she told him in a three-hour phone conversation that she wanted to quit her job.</p> <p>Some men in Respect hated the fact that she was a non-hijab-wearing Muslim woman, she says. \"The atmosphere around Respect was so hostile to women. I was seen as an outspoken, opinionated woman who had ideas, who made things happen, who organised events and the guys didn't like it at all.\"</p> <p>She says she had poured her heart out to Khan, who sent her an email suggesting how to cope in the hostile environment of the constituency office. In the email, he reminds her that \"all [Galloway's] previous PAs have had short shelf lives\" and that the fact that his last PA, also called Aisha, had refused to talk to her was \"always an indication\".</p> <p>He added: \"You know that GG will do whatever to protect his name and an easy time [sic].\" Knowing she was thinking of leaving, he warned her: \"Be CAREFUL that u don't go from the frying pan into the fire. There were already issues within the Respect Brad[ford].\"</p> <p>Why would Galloway make such bold claims against her? \"For political gain,\" says Ali-Khan. \"For newspaper mileage as well. Also, in his mind, he believes that if he discredits me, and makes me out to be a complete slag, then his supporters, the majority of whom are men, will not believe anything that comes out of my mouth \u2026 Also, I think it was a form of intimidation. However way you look at it, George has seen my private emails when he had no right to do so. Not only has he seen my private emails, he has then published them on the internet. So my question is: how did he get hold of those emails?\"</p> <p>Galloway strongly denies hacking or authorising anyone else to hack emails on his behalf, and stands by his story, saying: \"The police investigation will no doubt establish the truth.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jonn Elledge assembles complaints from some disgruntled language and education providers to argue that the British Council competes unfairly and does not adequately represent the UK sector abroad (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/08/british-council-education-training\" title=\"\">The British Council: friend or foe?</a>, 9 October). However, his article fails to communicate the council's charitable purpose and misrepresents our role in flying the flag for the UK.</p> <p>The British Council is a registered charity, governed by royal charter, and all our income is used to deliver our charitable purposes. Over 75% of the council's turnover is earned through teaching and exams, tendered contracts and partnerships. Less than 25% is UK government grant-in-aid, and all of it delivers for the UK. To say, as one quoted business leader does, that \"the British Council doesn't really enable British education exports, it inhibits them\" does not fit the evidence. We play an important role in promoting UK education exports \u2013 worth an estimated \u00a314bn in 2008-9.</p> <p>Our raison d'etre is to build trust between, and create opportunities for, people of the UK and other countries. We do this through our work in the arts, English language and education. Independent research indicates that international trade is more likely to flourish under conditions of trust. Whenever UK companies succeed in overseas markets, it proves what we do is working.</p> <p>The global market for English language and education provision is vast and growing. The British Council reaches about 11 million people. But while over a billion people are currently learning English, we are working with less than 1% of them \u2013 hardly the \"monopoly\" Patrick Watson suggests in Elledge's article.</p> <p>Neil McIntosh, chief executive of the CfBT Education Trust, asserts that our income-generating activities make it \"more difficult for [him] to compete\", in contrast with countries \"whose diplomatic missions represent their education systems more comprehensively\". Ironically these same countries often seek to emulate the British Council model, and its value for money.</p> <p>The article claims that our \"commercial goals\" could affect our advice to the sector, and states: \"Its Education UK website is intended to be the first port of call for international students looking to study in the UK.

  "<p>A freshly aired audio recording in which Mitt Romney asks business owners to talk with employees about the upcoming election sounds at first like a throwback to the bad old days of voter clientelism. That's the term academics use for the time-honored American practice of trading something nice for political support.</p> <p>Voters used to be able to get a shot of whiskey or a pair of boots. Now, in the era of expanding corporate rights, you might just get a half-promise not to be fired \u2013 as long as you vote the right way.</p> <p>Romney was speaking on a conference call that was sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.nfib.com/advocacy/item?cmsid=58241\">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a>, as part of a series that had previously featured Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann. He had been talking about why Barack Obama is bad for business. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucuMHuVlIW0&amp;feature=player_embedded#t=26m44s\">Then he encouraged employers to \"make it very clear to your employees\" how they feel about the presidential race</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I hope you make it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections. And whether you agree with me or you agree with President Obama, or whatever your political view, I hope \u2014 I hope you pass those along to your employees. Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business, because I think that will figure into their election decision, their voting decision and of course doing that with your family and your kids as well.</p> </blockquote> <p>The recording, which was first spied by <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing/\">In These Times</a>, has generated consternation on the left. It came to light in the same week that Mike Elk of In These Times reported that <a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/Koch/KOCH1.pdf\">the Koch brothers, David and Charles, had sent 45,000 employees packets containing actual lists of candidates supported by Koch Industries</a>. At the top of the list of approved candidates was Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Is it legal to do this? On the conference call, Romney went out of his way to say that it is, when he said: \"Nothing illegal about you talking to your employees...\" </p> <p>Romney has drawn a similar distinction in describing his strategy for paying taxes, saying: \"I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more.\" In Romneyland, legal compliance is a lofty moral paradigm.</p> <p>Romney also happens to be right: bosses can talk to employees about whom to vote for. Corporations can send political mailings to employees. And since the 2010 Citizens United Supreme Court decision, corporations appear to have new freedom to force employees to attend political events like the Romney rally in Beallsville, Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81421.html\">in which coal miners were forced to appear as campaign props</a>.</p> <p>Citizen United's generous interpretation of corporate speech means that employers \"may now be able to compel their employees to listen to their political views at [workplace] meetings on pain of termination,\" <a href=\"http://yalelawjournal.org/the-yale-law-journal-pocket-part/volume-120/addressing-political-captive-audience-workplace-meetings-in-the-post%11citizens-united-environment/\">wrote Paul Secunda, an associate law professor at Marquette University, in the Yale Law Journal</a>. \"Although federal law does still prevent employers from issuing explicit or implicit threats against employees who vote for the 'wrong' candidate, short of that, nothing prohibits employers from requiring employees to participate in one-sided political propaganda events.\"</p> <p>Employees have little real-life protection from aggressive attempts by employers to sway their votes, Secunda said in a phone interview Thursday.</p> <p>\"Workers are facing a constant stream of political pressure, 16 hours a day, a stream of literature,\" he said. \"This stuff has always taken place, especially in the blue-collar workplace. It's generally legal.\"</p> <p>The federal voter intimidation statute, which makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten, or coerce\" voters, is rarely called on to protect workers, he said.</p> <p>\"The devil's in the details,\" Secunda said. \"What does it mean to 'intimidate' as far as preventing the right to vote? An express type of threat? Some of these more implicit types of power dynamics don't explicitly meet this high standard.\"</p> <p>Some states have their own voter intimidation laws, Secunda said, but a paucity of relevant case law indicates a low level of enforcement.</p> <p>\"Employers are pretty much able to do what they want as far as putting pressure on employees to vote against a certain candidate,\" he said.</p> <p>Secunda said a new \"Federal Worker Freedom Act\" was needed, to prohibit employers from engaging in mandatory political indoctrination. A new law could comply with Citizen United's broad interpretation of corporate speech, he said.</p> <p>\"The focus is not on employers' speech,\" Secunda said. \"You can't interfere with that. The focus would be on regulating employer conduct.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was the printer's error that wiped about $20bn from the value of the world's biggest search engine. Shares in Google were suspended after an accidental email to the US stock market authorities revealed that the company's latest quarterly results were far below Wall Street's demanding expectations.</p> <p>The inadvertent \u2013 and clearly unfinished \u2013 financial release began with the words \"PENDING LARRY QUOTE\" \u2013 referring to the company's chief executive, Larry Page, whose job, normally, would be to put the best gloss on the financial figures. But he was likely to be offering different sentiments after the stock tumbled 9% before trading was halted. After trading resumed the shares recovered slightly to close down 8%.</p> <p>Company results circulate internally for several days as they are being prepared for public release to strict timetables, normally under strict secrecy. Leaks of the figures are extremely rare, but on this occasion Google tersely blamed financial printers RR Donnelly for filing its draft third quarter results \"without authorisation\".</p> <p>Compounding the situation was the fact that Google's figures missed expected profits and a showed a big slowdown in revenue growth for its main search engine advertising business. The company had little choice but to suspend trading in its nosediving shares.</p> <p>The surprisingly poor figures also point towards the challenging future that has already hobbled Facebook's stock after its dismal flotation earlier this year: the problem of making money from mobile advertising as users shift from the desktop to the smartphone to do their searching.</p> <p>The figures showed that Google earned $9.03 per share in the third quarter \u2013 notably below analysts' consensus estimates of $10.63. Its search engine revenues were also below expectations, hitting $11.5bn (\u00a37bn) where analysts had expected it to show $11.9bn (\u00a37.38bn).</p> <p>Nevertheless, even Google's misfiring revenues showed 19% growth from the same period last year. But, critically, that was a substantial slowing for a business that had consistently shown revenue growth since the end of 2009, when the global financial crisis was at its deepest.</p> <p>A key reason for the revenue and profit miss seemed to be a fall in \"cost per click\" \u2013 the amount that advertisers pay when people click on Google's adverts. Google said that such revenues fell by 15% year on year and by 3% compared with the second quarter, even while the number of \"paid clicks\" grew 33% year on year.</p> <p>Advertising rates for mobile phone advertising are typically lower than on desktop computers \u2013 rates that are in turn lower than for printed media. At the same time, as noted by Ben Schachter from Macquarie Securities, people used search engines less for the first time since anybody began tracking data showing their use \u2013 because people are discovering new content via apps on iPhones and other smart devices. That also suggests that the widespread shift to mobile use which has affected Facebook's prospects is starting to affect Google too. </p> <p>Another concern for Google will be the upwards creep in \"traffic acquisition costs\" (TAC) - the money that it pays to external websites to direct traffic to its search engines. That has risen as a proportion of advertising revenue from a low of 23.7% a year ago to 26% \u2013 back towards the 30% figure that it saw at the end of 2007. The higher the proportion, the higher the drag on profits on a search engine. Those too may come from Google's mobile business, where it pays money to Apple for some positions on the iPhone, and to some mobile carriers.</p> <p>Charlie Kindel, a former Microsoft general manager who worked on its Windows Phone development, commented on Twitter that Google might have to start focusing on ways to make its free Android mobile operating system pay. He said: \"Mark my words: a few more quarters like this, Amazon doing well with Kindle, and Google's approach to Android will quickly change.\" Amazon uses its own version of Android, stripped so that Google gets no ad revenue, in its Kindle Fire tablet.</p> <p>But Clark Fredricksen, vice-president of eMarketer, which tracks the online advertising business, said that despite the setback he feels that Google is in a strong position because of its underlying strength. Google remains dominant in search, with a 74.5% share of the US search ad market, according to eMarketer. In Europe, its market share is more than 95% \u2013 and the overall digital advertising market in the US grew by 17.7% in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>Fredricksen added: \"The company now holds the largest more revenue than any other company in the US search, display and mobile advertising markets, respectively \u2013 and the company's market share in each category is expected to grow in the coming years. Particularly in the mobile arena, Google holds a commanding lead over all other players, taking home more than half of all US mobile ad revenues. The nearest competitor, Pandora, takes home less than 10% of the market.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, a sheepish printer said it was \"fully engaged in an investigation to determine how this event took place and are pursuing our first obligation \u2013 which is to serve our valued customer\".</p> <p><strong> </strong>Its shares fell too in the wake of the Google leak \u2013 but only by 2%.</p> <h2><strong>Tech giants lose their touch</strong></h2> <p>The titans of Silicon Valley are beginning to lose their air of invincibility. Since Google's initial public offering in 2004, American technology companies had enjoyed an unprecedented run of good fortune, culminating in Apple's overthrow of oil giant Exxon Mobil as the world's most valuable business. But one by one, through a combination of greed, hubris and clerical error, the masters of the technology universe have been shooting themselves in the foot.</p> <p>First came Facebook's catastrophic initial public offering, when early investors cashed in their chips at too high a price. The shares skidded remorselessly downwards, and now trade at half their float value.</p> <p>In September, it was Apple's turn. The launch of the iPhone 5 lit up the internet, and sales have been spectacular, but within days of its arrival in the shops the company's chief executive Tim Cook had apologised for forcing a substandard mapping service on his customers. By giving Dublin and imaginary airport and turning Helsinki railway station into a park, Apple had proved itself capable of releasing a poorly designed, unfinished product. Now Google has made the same mistake, in the form of its latest financial results.</p> <p><strong>Juliette Garside</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012 to correct the title of Charlie Kindel.

  "<p>Prince Charles' charity aides have held at least 18 face-to-face meetings with senior cabinet ministers and top Downing Street officials since the beginning of last year, raising fresh questions over the heir to the throne's influence on British politics.</p> <p>The meetings took place over 13 months from the beginning of 2011 and include talks with four secretaries of state, the head of the civil service, the chief government scientist and the prime minister's key adviser on Europe and global issues.</p> <p>News of the prince's access to the highest reaches of the political establishment through his charities came amid a growing controversy over official secrecy surrounding his lobbying on issues ranging from planning to genetically modified crops and climate change. On Tuesday the attorney general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/attorney-general-blocks-prince-charles-letters\" title=\"\">blocked the release</a> of letters from the prince to ministers in seven government departments hinting that to do so could precipitate a constitutional crisis. He said any perception that Charles disagreed with government policy \"would be seriously damaging to his role as a future monarch\".</p> <p>The prince has established a network of 17 charities which is co-ordinated from Clarence House and operate in areas that mirror his interests including architecture, planning, environmental sustainability, farming, old age and corporate responsibility. Whitehall records show senior figures from the charities have met Vince Cable, the business secretary, Eric Pickles, communities secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, work and pensions secretary, and Caroline Spelman, then environment secretary.</p> <p>Charles's environmental advisers appear to be among his best connected aides. Representatives of the Prince's Charities' International Sustainability Unit (ISU), which works on behalf of the heir to the throne's interests in agriculture, marine conservation and rainforests, secured two meetings with Sir John Beddington, the government's chief scientific adviser. The first, in January 2011, was \"to discuss science\" around the time when Beddington, an expert in population biology, produced a major report that warned that moves to block cultivation of GM crops in the developing world could no longer be tolerated on ethical or moral grounds. Charles has long opposed GM crops and once accused agricultural multinationals of a \"gigantic experiment ... with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong\". When he was prime minister Tony Blair asked Peter Mandelson to tell the Prince of Wales to stop his \"unhelpful\" attempts to influence policy on GM and Mandelson accused him of being \"anti-scientific and irresponsible\".</p> <p>In the same period, the charity also secured two meetings with Sir John Cunliffe, then David Cameron's adviser on Europe and Global Issues and his lead representative at meetings of the G20 group of the world's richest nations. The first, in March 2011, was to \"discuss the work of the International Sustainability Unit\" and the second was about \"food security and G20\" ahead of a May meeting of G20 agriculture ministers that spring. When Cunliffe moved on, the charity quickly secured a meeting with his successor, Ivan Rogers.</p> <p>The prince's spokesman said the \"meetings with government ministers and officials are an opportunity to update the government on the ISU's work\" and denied any suggestion he is exerting undue influence on them through his charities.</p> <p>However, Graham Smith, director of the Republic pressure group which campaigns for an elected head of state, said his charities were \"lobbying ministers and officials across the whole range of issues in favour of Charles's political agenda\".</p> <p>Smith said: \"These groups are intervening at the highest level on some of the most controversial issues of the day and are gaining access that most lobby groups would struggle to get. This further adds to concerns about the extent to which public policy is being shaped according to the idiosyncratic views of Prince Charles.\"</p> <p>The prince's spokesman stressed the charities are independent organisations governed by their trustees.</p> <p>\"They communicate with government on issues relevant to their work, such as creating opportunities for disadvantaged young people, developing economic regeneration in deprived areas, encouraging businesses to help their local communities and promoting greater protection of the environment,\" he said.</p> <p>Other high level access for Charles' charity network includes a meeting between Duncan Smith and the Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise which helps people over 50 who are \"desperate to work but unable to find anyone to employ them\", two meetings between the Prince's Trust and then employment minister Chris Grayling on disadvantaged young people and youth unemployment and two meetings between Business in the Community and the current head of the civil service, Sir Bob Kerslake.</p> <p>Hank Dittmar, chief executive of the prince's built environment charity held meetings with Pickles and the then planning minister, Greg Clark, on \"planning policy\" in the run up to the government's publication of a new national planning framework.</p> <p>\"We won a competitive process to provide neighbourhood planning services to communities in support of the new Localism Bill,\" a spokeswoman for the charity said. \"The meetings with the secretary of state and the planning minister were to discuss this work. Meetings of this nature are something in which independent charities like ourselves routinely engage.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's way of running the country becomes ever more eccentric. This week he was like a dyspeptic columnist. On Wednesday he raged about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/18/cameron-energy-department-explain-tariff?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">soaring energy prices</a>, leapt up in the House of Commons and said he would \"pass a law\" against them. That is the joy of being a Blairite prime minister. Margaret Thatcher would have spent hours fussing over how to do what she said. Cameron just blurts it out and leaves others to cope with the mess.</p> <p>All hell broke loose. The prime minister told the Commons he would legislate \"so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers\", not just the 25% who now opt for it. There were gasps all round. Whitehall officials had to burn the midnight oil \"clarifying\" what on earth the prime minister meant by thus denying choice. By morning a lexicographical genius decided that \"have to\" did not imply compulsion. A junior minister, John Hayes, said merely that \"a number of options are under consideration\", though by the day's end this was re-clarified as meaning a big stick.</p> <p>That is what happened a year ago, when Cameron did the same thing, summoning the energy bosses and telling them he was frightfully cross. They smiled, shook him by the hand and increased prices 13%, with a further 6-9% this year. Most of them are foreign-owned and really do not mind what a British prime minister says.</p> <p>Some might see this as rather humiliating, but Cameron is cut from original cloth. He does not rule but muses, suggests, stirs the pot; free of interfering staff work or research. Like Carroll's Queen of Hearts he reverses causality, with decision first, consultation afterwards. We have seen it over planning, health, airports, family taxes, forests, high-speed trains, Europe, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9362656/U-turns-make-even-David-Cameron-wonder-what-this-Government-is-for.html\" title=\"\">everything</a>. Each is followed by a review, a U-turn, a committee, perhaps a postponement until the next election. Hence his enthusiasm for that jewel of dilatory government, the independent inquiry.</p> <p>Cameron is right that months of hollering about utility prices and confused charging systems have yielded nothing but higher charges. Falling world gas and coal prices are not being reflected in falling domestic costs, but the reverse. Regulated privatisation has not worked. As far back as 1987 Thatcher's aide Ferdinand Mount remarked that \"the regulators have no teeth and the operators no conscience\". Eight years later, the then Ofgas regulator, Clare Spottiswoode, was accused of producer capture. She told parliament she was \"wholly unaccountable\" and her reports \"not worth the paper they are printed on\".</p> <p>Not much has changed, except that producer capture has got worse. Massive profits have brought foreign owners running. Coherent planning of long-term capacity has collapsed, victim of a not-so-civil war between government and the industry. On the one side are greedy but confused power companies, on the other ministers in thrall to lobbyists created by their own subsidies. The energy minister, Ed Davey, like his predecessor, Chris Huhne, seems at times to be reading out press releases from wind farm lobbyists, as do his colleagues on nuclear.</p> <p>There is no way privatisation can determine where energy should come from after most coal and nuclear power stations close over the next decade. Britain, unable to take important decisions because they require courage, is starting to resemble a third-world country, and facing eventual power cuts. Cameron's exasperation is understandable. Perhaps he should pass a law banning exasperation.</p> <p>This week, the Oxford professor of energy policy, Dieter Helm,<a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/\" title=\"\"> publishes an attack on the whole vexed realm of carbon policy</a>. In The Carbon Crunch he does not quarrel with the statistical basis of climate change, only with its policy consequences. These he regards as driven by green faddishness into barking lunacy.</p> <p>Speaking at the Royal Society last week, Helm addressed two contrasting scenarios. If climate change is not urgent, then we can go on arguing, researching and building North Sea windmills and Saharan mirrors until the sacred cows come home. But if warming really is accelerating, and Helm accepts that it is, then there is no time to lose. There is certainly no time to mess about with footprints, windmills and air miles. A crisis is what it says.</p> <p>At present, rising world demand for energy is being met by coal. China, India, Germany, even Britain, are consuming ever more coal. China is building a coal power station every week. The one country not \"dashing for coal\" is the US, because it is dashing for gas, whose emissions per unit of energy are half those of coal. As a result, America's emissions and energy prices are falling compared with the rest of the world. It is the one virtuous player.</p> <p>To Helm, the answer is simple. The only short-term substitute for coal is not nuclear, which takes too long and is too expensive, but gas. Of course, gas is carbon, and we are still far from \"capturing\" its emissions. Of course, building gas stations may prejudice long-term investment in zero-carbon sources of power. Helm is messianic on researching such sources, be they sun, Earth, tide, even nuclear. But all that is over the horizon. Gas is in \"near limitless supply\" and for the world to turn against it merely prolongs dependence on coal and expedites climate change.</p> <p>Helm's other cause is not to attack production but to tax carbon consumption through a straight carbon tax. The money should go into research and carbon capture. It is also wrong to deny poorer consumers the benefit of cheap gas, as now, when we tax every energy bill to cross-subsidise the idling turbine parks of rich landowners. The green lobby \"has a lot to answer for\". At the Royal Society Helm came close to accusing it of driving forward climate change by ignoring gas.</p> <p>I am not qualified to know if Helm is right, but he writes with a convincing passion. He is also rumoured to have the ear of the Treasury, determined to press ahead with a new generation of gas power stations. Certainly Cameron on Wednesday sold an ideological pass. A Tory prime minister was meddling in the market for power to deny choice and fix prices. Will he extend this to petrol, air fares and bank charges? He also as good as admitted that the private sector can never sort out the energy mess. Having \"decided\" what to do on Wednesday, perhaps he can now decide what to do next.</p>",
  "<p>Former England players said on Thursday that <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/football/2012/oct/18/england-players-uppers-downers\" title=\"\">the use of caffeine tablets and sleeping pills </a> was widespread throughout football for years in the wake of suggestions that they may have contributed to the team's sluggish performance in Warsaw on Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>Some England players are believed to have taken sleeping pills after their World Cup qualifier with Poland was called off on Tuesday in order to counteract the effect of caffeine tablets taken before the match. Taking caffeine, whether in the form of energy drinks or Pro Plus tablets, is commonplace before matches throughout football.</p> <p>Players defended the practice, which has been called into question by some doctors. Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand said on Twitter: \"What's all the fuss with caffeine/sleeping tablets?? Players have used them for yrs before + after games without any fuss.\"</p> <p>Everton's captain Phil Neville claimed that the use of sleeping pills on the night before a match is a standard practice. He wrote: \"Throughout my career players have taken sleeping pills night be4 game and caffeine tablets day of game never been a problem in media be4.\"</p> <p>Following England's 1-1 draw with Poland, the defender Glen Johnson told Radio 5 Live that \"a lot of the lads take Pro Plus tablets before the game and we all took them for the game yesterday \u2013 then the game is off and no one can sleep\".</p> <p>Caffeine is not on the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list, having been removed in 2004, but remains part of its \"monitoring programme\" of substances that are not prohibited but are tracked in order to detect patterns of misuse. \"The 2010 and 2011 Monitoring Programs did not reveal global specific patterns of misuse of caffeine in sport, though a significant increase in consumption in the athletic population is observed,\" said Wada.</p> <p>The new code of conduct distributed to all of England's representative teams states in the section on standards required of players at all times, regardless of whether they are on international duty, that there should be \"no use of drugs without a doctor's permission\".</p> <p>As prescription drugs, sleeping pills would be covered by the edict. Dr Peter Brukner, the former head of sports science at Liverpool, said it is relatively unusual for players to be prescribed sleeping pills. \"It does happen but it is relatively unusual. It's on a case-by-case basis. It boils down to a situation where for some reason or another a player thinks he might be unable to sleep, so you weigh up the merits of having sleeping pills to get some sleep versus the obvious negatives of having sleeping tablets. In most cases the decision would be they don't take a sleeping tablet, but in certain cases they do.\"He said that modern sleeping tablets leave the system much more quickly and so they can be taken with fewer side-effects the next day. \"They don't give you as long a sleep but they are out of your system in four or five hours. We are much less reluctant to use these sleeping tablets than we were the old ones.\"</p> <p>Dr Brukner said he is not surprised players may have taken caffeine tablets, which is common in his experience. \"It's probably an individual thing. Some players respond to caffeine, others don't. Some players like taking it because they are alert and it helps them concentrate.\"</p>",
  "<p>Western firms are preparing for slower growth in China after Beijing said it expected growth to stabilise at 7.5% for the next few years.</p> <p>The world's second biggest economy grew 7.4% in the third quarter compared with a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of slower growth, prompting warnings from Nestl\u00e9 and Nokia that their bottom line was being affected.</p> <p>The Swiss maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescaf\u00e9 coffee said sales growth in Asia, Oceania and Africa, which account for one fifth of its total sales, fell from 11.6% to 9.4%. Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone firm, also blamed slower growth in China for weaker international sales.</p> <p>China's growth figure was only just below government forecasts, while a recent surge in industrial output, retail sales and business investment has appeared to put its economy on a sounder footing.</p> <p>Premier Wen Jiabao was quoted as saying that the economic situation in the third quarter was relatively good, and that the government was confident of achieving its goals. But Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, said upbeat comments from China's leaders were misleading.</p> <p>Announcing the numbers, the National Bureau of Statistics said a higher than expected rise in September showed growth was on track to stay above target. \"We have 7.7% growth in September, which laid a solid foundation for achieving the full-year growth target. So we are confident that we can achieve 7.5% full-year growth or above,\" said a NBS spokesman, Sheng Laiyun.</p> <p>Williams said a 9.1% annualised figure for the third quarter failed to tally with other economic data, but nevertheless a 7.4% growth rate based on the last four quarters revealed the economy had stabilised and was stronger than expected.</p> <p>\"There are also some signs that growth may have started to pick-up towards the end of the third quarter. That said, we think the speed of the turnaround implied by the official figures is implausible and, barring significant further policy moves, expect only a tepid turnaround over coming quarters.Our forecasts remain that the economy will expand around 7.6% this year and only 8% in 2013.\"</p> <p>Alistair Thornton, senior China economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"Those fearing a hard landing will be able to sleep a little better, but those positioned for a clear recovery might be disappointed. The picture is one of emerging stabilisation, not the return of unbridled optimism.\"</p> <p>European stock markets reacted positively, as the prospects of a China-induced recession receded before paring back gains in afternoon trading.</p> <p>Several analysts said Beijing was keen to moderate growth to prevent the economy from entering a boom and bust cycle. After the financial crisis, China embarked on a stimulus that maintained consumer demand. But the extra cash spilled over into the property sector and triggered an upsurge in prices.</p> <p>A downturn after the Greek debt debacle was avoided by cuts in interest rates, that many analysts feared would fuel to an even bigger property price bubble. Projections that China has waved goodbye to double-digit growth is expected to cool property prices and prevent any overheating causing panic and a price crash.</p> <h2>Watch sales slow</h2> <p>The Chinese love affair with expensive Swiss watches is over. Sales have gone into reverse for the first time in three years after a phenomenal export drive that turned Hong Kong and mainland China into the biggest market for Swiss timepieces.</p> <p>A 27% fall in Swiss watch sales in September was driven largely by an economic slowdown that has also hit German cars and imported mobile phones. Global sales fell 10% by volume and 2.7% by value. The new Bond film, Skyfall, which promotes 007's \u00a33,200 Omega wristwatch, may help with the marketing effort, but according to the Swiss Watch Federation, a fall in sales was to be expected.</p> <p>\"The Chinese economy is running at a slower tempo,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>Omega is owned by Swatch, which is the biggest watchmaker in the world. The James Bond name may also help in Europe, where sales are still rising.</p> <p>\"It is unusual and unexpected, but we think in Europe we have profited from sales to tourists,\" , said the federation spokesman.</p> <p>Hong Kong accounts for 21% of all Swiss watch sales, compared with the US's with a 10.3% in the US's share, and mainland China's is close behind with 8.5% in mainland China.</p> <p>According to industry experts most Hong Kong sales are to visiting Chinese who use their visit to the former British colony to stock up on expensively branded goods.</p> <p>One analyst said the Swiss were in danger of seeing its 19bn swiss franc industry suffer from a prolonged slowdown in China. French luxury goods maker LVMH and Richemont are two major firms that could also suffer.</p> <p>\"Even if Swiss watch exports are very volatile on a monthly basis we can only be negative after this publication with -20% decline in Asia and negative figures in the US,\" said analysts at Chevreux, part of Credit Agricole.</p> <p>The Chinese post crisis boom allowed the Swiss watch industry to break all records in 2011. Hong Kong overtook the US to be the largest market for Swiss watch exports in 2008 and is constantly growing.</p> <p>A report by Fortune Character magazine revealed that the price of imported high-end watches has increased since 2007 with the average price up by 205% since 2007 to $6,812 in 2011.</p>",
  "<p>Nokia has burned through \u20ac633m (\u00a3514m) of cash in three months with sales falling by 20% in a year, thanks to sluggish demand for its smartphones and a near \u20ac1bn collapse in takings from China.</p> <p>The Finnish company has spent almost a third of its cash reserves in 12 months, and has \u20ac3.6bn left in the bank to fund into a smartphone maker capable of competing with Apple and Samsung.</p> <p>\"The big investor concern is that Nokia might run out of cash before windows phone builds a successful following,\" said analyst Mark Sue at RBC Capital markets.</p> <p>The shares rose more than 8% in early trading, before closing up less than 1% at \u20ac2.20 as bad news about handsets was balanced by a turnaround at Nokia Siemens Networks. The subsidiary, which makes telecoms equipment, swung back into profit after making more than 14,000 job cuts and reducing its product lines to concentrate on mobile rather than fixed line networks.</p> <p>Once the mobile market leader, Nokia has lost almost 90% of its stock market value since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. On Thursday it reported its sixth straight quarter of losses since adopting Microsoft's Windows phone software.</p> <p>Third quarter sales fell to \u20ac7.2bn, better than analysts were forecasting but down from nearly \u00a39bn in the third quarter of 2011, as smartphone shipments withered by 10m to 6.3m units. Overall shipments fell 22% to 83m, with only 300,000 phones sold in North America. Devices sales fell in every region except Latin America, with takings in China collapsing from \u20ac1.2bn to \u20ac300m. A spokesman said this was due to a switch in strategy by Chinese mobile networks, which have begun subsidising handsets but are generally pushing models with a lower cost than those made by Nokia.</p> <p>The group's Lumia smartphones, which run on Microsoft's operating system, declined in popularity with global shipments falling to 2.9m units, down from 4m in the second quarter.</p> <p>Customers have stayed away because only the new Lumia models, which Elop confirmed would be released in a \"select\" number of markets in November, will be able to run the latest version of Windows Phone software, due to be released by Microsoft on 29 October.</p> <p>The decision to push Lumia in just a few markets before Christmas means Nokia can concentrate its marketing firepower, but the company warned fourth quarter smartphone volumes would not see the usual seasonal uplift.</p> <p>\"New products will ship halfway through the quarter into an overwhelmingly competitive and congested market,\" warned Geoff Blaber at mobile research firm CCS Insight.</p> <p>Nokia will benefit from the fact that mobile networks are keen to see an alternative to Android and Apple emerge, Elop said. \"We are seeing increasing concern among operators about the concentration of power that is landing with two particular ecosystems that are out there today,\" he told analysts on a conference call. \"You are going to see operators in the West beginning to say we need a third ecosystem.\"</p> <p>After Apple's mapping fiasco, he was keen to highlight Nokia's well regarded location services, and the company has now started publishing how much it earns from licensing its maps technology. Sales to third parties such as Amazon and Yahoo! were \u20ac180m in the quarter.</p> <p>Elop brushed aside suggestions that Nokia's special relationship with Microsoft was threatened by Taiwan's HTC. Microsoft chief executive Steven Ballmer made a personal appearance last month at the launch of HTC's new range, which the company is calling Windows Phone 8 as it attempts to establish its handsets as the truest expression of the Windows operating system.</p> <p>Microsoft pays Nokia $250m a quarter in marketing money, which more than offsets software royalty payments back to Microsoft, and Windows uses Nokia maps. \"The fact that Microsoft has a critical dependency on us for location based services highlights the importance of this relationship working well in both directions,\" said Elop.</p>",

  "<h2>Ha-Joon Chang: Further unrest will stall recovery</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996165\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/4/30/1272628800898/Ha-Joon_Chang.jpg\" alt=\"Ha-Joon Chang\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande says the worst is over for the eurozone crisis, but I don't agree, for two reasons. First, while the European Central Bank (ECB) has recently done things to calm the financial market for the moment, it is not clear whether it will be able to repeat this act if the world economic situation gets worse \u2013 the Chinese economy is slowing down and the US may experience a double-dip recession if Mitt Romney wins and lets Paul Ryan loose on the budget.</p> <p>Second, even if there is no further austerity for Greece and other \"periphery\" countries (as Hollande promises), the swingeing cuts that have already been made to the social spending in those countries are overwhelming. Many people in those countries have stretched themselves to the limit to cope with the cuts, but they cannot continue to do so for much longer, especially in the face of high unemployment. When they decide that they have had enough, there will be further social unrest, which will stall the recovery, as long-term investors, whom Europe needs for a genuine recovery, need a stable environment.</p> <p>\u2022 Ha-Joon Chang teaches economics at Cambridge University</p> <h2>Alistair Darling: Three steps are necessary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996166\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/5/13/1242216271646/Alistair-Darling-MP-001.jpg\" alt=\"Alistair Darling MP\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alistair Darling MP Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I agree with President Hollande that recession is as big a threat as debt. I wish I could agree that Europe is near to the end of the crises. The eurozone will probably not break up but that is because of politics rather than economics.</p> <p>For recovery, three steps are necessary:</p> <p>First \u2013 the eurozone banks need to be properly capitalised and toxic debts dealt with. Spain needs to do this urgently. A credible timetable for the banking union needs to be put in place, although that will have implications for the UK.</p> <p>Second \u2013 a credible solution to the Greek problems needs to be put in place.</p> <p>Third \u2013 I agree that austerity on its own will never work. What is needed is a credible plan for growth and deficit reduction.</p> <p>The ECB has bought time. The eurozone leaders needs to agree a credible plan.</p> <p>\u2022 Alistair Darling was chancellor of the exchequer from 2007 to 2010</p> <h2>Costas Lapavitsas: The ECB can provide liquidity, but not solvency</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996167\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/9/23/1316775554457/costas.jpg\" alt=\"Costas Lapavitsas\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This misleading impression has been created by Mario Draghi of the ECB, who announced that he will lend freely to countries in trouble, driving interest rates down. There has already been virulent opposition, led by the Bundesbank. For conservative German opinion, Draghi is the devil in Goethe's Faust, luring Angela Merkel into a deadly pact of inflation. Also, for ECB lending to materialise, a country must first accept tough austerity conditions. Which European politician will do that?</p> <p>Above all, the ECB can provide liquidity, but can do nothing about the solvency of states. The eurozone periphery is effectively bankrupt, and the EU policy of austerity is making things worse, especially in Greece. The economy has collapsed, public debt will soon need another major haircut; there are huge human costs and explosive social conditions. If the crisis is even to approach resolution, austerity must be lifted and investment funds directed to the periphery. As there is no prospect of that, 2013 will probably be even worse.</p> <p>\u2022 Costas Lapavitsas is professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London</p> <h2>Phillip Inman: Optimism set against a gamble</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996168\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/1/1322756876629/Phillip-Inman-003.jpg\" alt=\"Phillip Inman\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phillip Inman Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is possible that a bailout for Spain, an agreement for a eurozone-wide banking union and the appointment of a sword-wielding budget tsar will draw a line under the current crisis. Calm may also be restored because, above all, eurozone leaders are desperate to stay inside the currency zone to save face and tackle internal problems they themselves are incapable of dealing with (corruption in Greece and employment protections in Italy and Spain are two examples).</p> <p>But this optimism is set against the gamble that low-paid workers in the worst affected countries will accept a sharp decline in their living standards and the loss of democratic accountability that comes with the creation of centralised bureaucracies in Brussels.</p> <p>Keeping wages low and forcing the repayment of all bank and sovereign debts will act as a drag on consumer spending and growth for many years, prolonging the current depression. Spending cuts tend to affect lower income groups, especially when the cuts are to welfare payments.</p> <p>Britain is about to embark on the second stage of austerity with a particular focus on cuts to social security spending. The trade unions are already assessing the likely impact of a proposed general strike. There are concerns that leaders in Germany, Holland, Finland and Austria will demand that all debts be repaid by governments and banks in the periphery. That's a recipe for social unrest across the rest of Europe \u2013 something the International Monetary Fund has already warned about.</p> <p>\u2022 Phillip Inman is the Guardian's economics correspondent</p> <h2>Luis Garicano: Empty promises won't end the crisis</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996169\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350574679385/Luis-Garicano.jpg\" alt=\"Luis Garicano\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Is it nearly over? No! Undoubtedly, the European Union took this summer three decisions which, if implemented, could end the critical stage of the crisis. First, the ECB decided to act like a grown-up central bank and deal forcefully with panic-driven rollover crisis in its member states bond markets. Second, the eurozone agreed a direct recapitalisation of Spain's failing banks. Third, a banking union was agreed.</p> <p>These measures could deal with legacy banking debt, allow member states to finance themselves at non-punitive rates and set up key institutions for a sustainable eurozone future. Regrettably, while the ECB's promise has not yet been tested, it looks like the other two were empty promises. Spain was recently told its legacy banking debt was its problem and nobody else's, clouding the prospect of a recovery any time soon. And the German government blocked all the steps towards the banking union. Spain is facing an unprecedented depression, which is putting at risk its very existence as a country. If its partners will not admit any responsibility for the legacy debt \u2013 the consequence of the poor Euro design \u2013 Spain will not get out of the hole, and Europe will remain at risk.</p> <p>\u2022 Luis Garicano is professor of economics and strategy at the London School of Economics and Political Science</p> <h2>Olaf Gersemann: This is only a respite</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397996170\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350577056673/Olaf.jpg\" alt=\"Olaf\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We might have entered a period of relative calm in the eurozone. The key reason is simple: Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, wants to be re-elected in September 2013, and it seems obvious to observers in Berlin that until then she will try to prevent anything that might lead to renewed panic attacks on financial markets. This alone makes, among other things, a \"Grexit\" over the next 12 months unlikely.</p> <p>However, it's not only Greece that is still not on a sustainable path. It's far from clear if and how the euro club's southern members will bring down their debt levels and current account deficits decisively at a time when the chances of being bailed out by the ECB and the ESM. More specifically, only time will tell whether people in Portugal or Spain or Greece are willing to suffer through a multi-year painful adjustment period rather than having their countries leave the euro system. It is also far from assured how voters in Germany will react once they really have to pick up the bill.</p> <p>No, President Hollande is very likely to be wrong. It ain't over till it's over.</p> <p>\u2022 Olaf Gersemann is business editor of Die Welt</p>",

We\u2019ve been working on this across government since last October\u2019s energy summit. What we want to do is take the hassle factor out for the consumer and put the obligation on the energy company. As you\u2019d expect the detail will be fully consulted on but we want to use the law to support those who are saving to support their aspirations.</p> <p><strong>Q: If everyone is moved to the cheapest tariff won\u2019t that mean that there\u2019s only one tariff?</strong></p> <p>This is not about taking away consumer choice but putting the emphasis on the energy company to give people who want to get on value for money.

A heady brew.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chromativity.fluidfootball\">Fluid Football</a></h2> <p>Alongside New Star Soccer, the iOS version of Fluid Football has been proving that there's room in the football game genre for indie innovation. Its Android port will be welcomed by fans, with its line-drawing gameplay as you plot the best route to goal for your players.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/marvel-war-of-heroes/id536478373?mt=8\">Marvel War of Heroes</a></h2> <p>Originally intended for inclusion last week, this is a big deal: Marvel's stable of superheroes (including Spider-Man, Hulk and Iron Man) meet DeNA's Mobage social mobile gaming network, and the card-battling genre that's been so lucrative for games like Rage of Bahamut. In this case, you're building a team of superheroes and battling other players.<br><strong>iPhone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vc.nba2k13.mynba2k\">My NBA2K</a></h2> <p>This is a companion app for console game NBA 2K13, but it's also a collection of basketball-themed mini-games in its own right. The clever bit is that playing this mobile version earns you virtual currency for use in the console edition, on PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii U. The link above is for Android, but <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mynba2k/id566667470?mt=8\">here's the iOS version</a>.<br><strong>Android / iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/symphonica/id556744011?mt=8\">Symphonica</a></h2> <p>Square Enix is having a crack at reinventing music games for touchscreens with Symphonica, which focuses on a classical music conductor. It wraps a proper storyline around the conducting gameplay, which features nearly 50 works. Individual chapters are sold via in-app purchase. The link above is for iPhone, but <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/symphonica-for-ipad/id559645118?mt=8\">here's the iPad version</a>.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redrobot.globaloutbreak\">Global Outbreak</a></h2> <p>Global Outbreak is the latest game from location-based games publisher Red Robot Labs, following its popular Life is Crime.

The game involves bouncing on platforms grabbing rings, unlocking new characters and power-ups, and beating bosses. And if all this sounds a bit too much like Doodle Jump for comfort, well, the game was out for feature phones before the iPhone even existed...<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftR3HM\">Real Football 2013</a></h2> <p>Shortly after its iOS release, Real Football 2013 has also launched on Android. Gameloft's football game has a hatful of licences, impressive graphics, and \u2013 new for 2013 \u2013&nbsp;a deeper club development mode. It's also freemium, which should make for some interesting competition with rival FIFA 13.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.beholdstudios.knightspp\">Knights of Pen &amp; Paper</a></h2> <p>This looks marvellous: an \"indie turn-based retro style pixel-art RPG\" that aims to recapture the feel of pen'n'paper roleplaying in the 1990s.

Carmageddon is a driving game with the emphasis firmly on the knocking things over and causing carnage side of driving.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.acquire.sumioni_thd\">Sumioni Demon Arts THD</a></h2> <p>\"You will be demon ink!\" promises the Google Play listing for this stylish Android game, which is certainly a pitch I haven't heard before from a mobile game. It originally appeared on Sony's PS Vita handheld, with characterful graphics. Runs best in its current incarnation on devices with the latest Tegra processors.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blowfishstudios.razorsalvationthd\">Razor Salvation THD</a></h2> <p>And here's another Tegra-focused Android game, the first in a planned series of action titles that sees you saving the world from an alien invasion. Beefy graphics and destructible environments make the most of the processors, and it also works in stereoscopic TV when your device is hooked up to a compatible TV.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/cracking-sands/fe13bec2-7406-4fed-a3fd-6f7b3a8065b3\">Cracking Sands</a></h2> <p>Microsoft is continuing its steady flow of one Xbox Live game a week for Windows Phone smartphones. Off-road racer Cracking Sands is the latest, which ditches the idea of vehicle categories in favour of a great big free-for-all where dirty tactics go side-by-side with racing skills.<br><strong>Windows Phone</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sir-death/id535307385?mt=8\">Sir Death</a></h2> <p>If you've been thinking 'really, there aren't enough zombie games on the App Store, WHO will bring me another?', help is at hand from Gamevil. You play the Sir Death character, dealing lordly execution to the brains of hordes of zombies, with lashings of blood and freemium business models.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.hum-this.com/\">Hum This!</a></h2> <p>Covered in more depth on the Apps Blog <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/oct/16/hum-this-social-mobile-game\">earlier in the week</a>, this is a cross between Draw Something and SongPop that sees you humming assigned songs then pinging them to friends to guess the tune.

It's another Mobage-branded card battler game, this time with an official licence from Major League Baseball. That means the gameplay involves constructing the perfect team while playing against people online.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fighting-fantasy-blood-zombies/id564626718?mt=8\">Fighting Fantasy: Blood of the Zombies</a></h2> <p>Here's another well-loved brand from a few decades ago being revived for the App Store. Ian Livingstone has teamed up with Tin Man Games to make a \"digital Fighting Fantasy gamebook\" based on the famous roleplaying books series. And yes, zombies are the focus here too.<br><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.highlinegames.welder\">W.E.L.D.E.R.</a></h2> <p>For all the console-quality 3D graphics and action-adventure games (and zombies) being flung at mobile devices in 2012, it's still hard to beat a really good word game for addictiveness. W.E.L.D.E.R. is a <em>really</em> good word game that's just made the leap from iOS to Android. It's like a supercharged mutation of Boggle and Scrabble, with power-ups and multipliers aplenty.<br><strong>Android</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://blogs.virginmedia.com/games/one-hundred-day-game-project/blogs/get-superfluid-on-your-phone-now\">Super-Fluid</a></h2> <p>Super-Fluid has an unusual history: it's the work of a collective of young developers, gathered by Virgin Media as part of its 100 Day Game Project to make a new mobile game in...

  "<p>For much of his career Igor Sechin \u2013 a former Soviet spy and close ally of Vladimir Putin \u2013 has been a man in the shadows. During Putin's first presidential stint, the joke doing the rounds in Moscow was that Sechin didn't actually exist: instead, US diplomats mischievously suggested, he was a sort of urban myth, a bogeyman invented by the Kremlin to instil fear.</p> <p>Today, however, Sechin, the chairman of Rosneft, has taken another step away from the dark. He has offered a deal that would see Rosneft acquire BP's stake in its troubled Russian joint venture TNK-BP, with BP in return acquiring 10%-20% of Rosneft. The Russian company has reportedly offered BP $28bn in shares and cash. Sechin has overseen the deal himself: he flew from Moscow to London on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The tie-up would see Rosneft leap from near-obscurity just over a decade ago to become the world's biggest publicly traded oil company \u2013 an extraordinary rise that can only be put down to Sechin himself.</p> <p>During Putin's first two presidential terms, Sechin was Putin's deputy chief of staff. In 2008 Dmitry Medvedev \u2013 Putin's weak temporary successor \u2013 made Sechin deputy prime minister, a demotion. When Putin came back to the Kremlin in May, many were surprised when he failed to offer Sechin a government job.</p> <p>But Sechin's official positions in Russia's hierarchy understate his real influence. During the Putin era it is Sechin who has been in charge of Russia's energy sector, up until 2008 operating largely from behind the scenes. His power flows from his perceived closeness to Putin. Not only are they friends with a common KGB heritage but, according to leaked US diplomatic cables, they also share \"economic interests\".</p> <p>Sechin is widely regarded to be the head of the Kremlin's <em>siloviki</em> clan, made up of nationalist hardliners with a security or military background. He is a proponent of strong state control, especially in the energy sector. The <em>siloviki</em> are at odds with a modernising camp inside the Kremlin, some analysts suggest, who favour greater economic liberalisation and Russia's integration with the west. Putin, meanwhile, plays the role of intra-elite arbiter, balancing the interests of both factions.</p> <p>Others, however, dismiss this as rubbish. They say the internecine struggles inside the Kremlin are not about political philosophy or ideology, but merely battles between rival clans trying to divide up the spoils. (In Russia, the spoils amount to billions of dollars.)</p> <p>Sechin has often been seen as a competitor to the moderate Medvedev within Russia's ruling elite. More realistic, however, is the scathing view that Medvedev was only ever the \"number three guy\" \u2013 behind Putin and Sechin in terms of power and influence.</p> <p>To his enemies, Sechin is a malevolent figure, a Kremlin grey cardinal crossed with the Big Bad Wolf. The charge list against him goes something like this: it was Sechin who personally engineered the demise of the oil giant Yukos in 2003, and the jailing of its billionaire owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky. (Rosneft promptly swallowed Yukos's assets; Khodorkovsky is still in jail.) Sechin also led the <em>siloviki's</em> opposition to foreign investment in Russia, especially in oil and gas. And there are suspicions that it is Sechin who has directed oil exports towards the murky Swiss-based oil trader Gunvor, while sidelining other customers.</p> <p>But there are pluses as well. In a 2009 John Beyrle, then US ambassador in Moscow, listed some of Sechin's achievements. He had, the ambassador wrote, \"unquestionably transformed Russia's most dismal oil company into a globally competitive state champion (albeit with Yukos's assets)\", adding that \"he also protected Rosneft from a putative merger with Gazprom in apparent contradiction of Putin's desires\". The ambassador cited further examples of Sechin's \"enlightened management\" \u2013 he listens to minority shareholders, unusual in Russia, and even hired an American as Rosneft's chief financial officer. The diplomatic cables, though, reveal that a frustrated US government has had \"virtually no interaction\" with Sechin.</p> <p>It is too early to parse just what the BP-Rosneft deal means. But Sechin appears to have recognised that Rosneft can only become a major global champion with international investment and expertise. Russia is still the world's largest producer and exporter of hydrocarbons. But the country's energy sector has stood still for some time, and may even be slipping backwards \u2013 with oil production stagnant, underinvestment in exploration and production, and heavy-handed state control.</p> <p>In common with other suspected former KGB officers, Sechin's biography is something of a mystery. Putin famously spent the 1980s as a KGB liaison officer in communist east Germany and Dresden; Sechin \u2013 a languages graduate from Leningrad state university \u2013 was stationed in Mozambique. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, he worked in the mayor's office at St Petersburg. When Putin became first deputy mayor, Sechin became his chief of staff in 1994; he has been at Putin's side ever since.</p> <p>Putin is now set to stay in the Kremlin until 2018, and possibly until 2024. Sechin, then, will remain at the summit of Russian oil power for some years to come.</p>",
  "<p>Ministers are facing the prospect of having to abandon the controversial cull of badgers in England, for this year at least, due to fast-rising costs, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/05/badger-cull-tb-cattle\" title=\"\">The cull</a>, aimed at curbing the rising infections of tuberculosis (TB) in cattle, is running out of time to begin before winter weather means the badgers lie low in their setts. The environment secretary, Owen Paterson, and farming minister David Heath cancelled a series of interviews on Thursday, but department officials said there was no U-turn: \"There is no change to the badger cull policy. We want the cull to happen as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>The Guardian can reveal that the estimated number of badgers in the pilot cull areas in Gloucestershire and Somerset have turned out to be far higher than the figures used to estimate the initial cost. Farmers must commit to killing at least 70% of the badgers in the cull zone, or fleeing badgers will spread TB further. But the Guardian can also reveal that each culled badger carries a bounty on its head, which means that having to kill more badgers means costs must rise.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121017/text/121017w0001.htm#12101764001054\" title=\"\">parliamentary answer</a> on Wednesday, Heath told shadow environment secretary, Mary Creagh: \"The best estimate for the number of badgers within each pilot area is: west Gloucestershire, 3,600; west Somerset: 4,300.\" However, the environment department's original, generic estimates, before recent surveys were conducted, were 2,000-3,000 for cull zones of that size. The figures show killing costs have as much as doubled in the case of Somerset.</p> <p>A Whitehall source told the Guardian that, because the killing costs have to be borne by farmers and landowners, the National Farmers' Union (NFU) president, Peter Kendall, feels the cull may now be too expensive to carry out, given the new higher badger numbers. The government's own impact assessment had already shown that carrying out the cull will cost more than it saves. A spokesman for the NFU said they did not recognise that view from Kendall and were not aware of any change in the government's policy.</p> <p>Creagh said: \"The abandoning of the cull would be good news because we have always said the cull was bad for wildlife, bad for farmers and bad for taxpayers. The science is clear that it risks making things worse.\" On Sunday, 32 eminent scientists, including those who designed and ran a landmark 10-year culling trial, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/13/badger-cull-mindless\" title=\"\">called on ministers to halt the cull</a>. But ministers argue that the rising costs of bovine TB \u2013 \u00a390m in 2011 and 26,000 cattle slaughtered \u2013 means that culling has to go ahead, alongside tighter biosecurity and investment in vaccination research.</p> <p>The cull licences were issued by Natural England for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england\" title=\"\">Gloucestershire on 17 September</a> and for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/04/farming-shortcomings-badger-cull-bovine-tb\" title=\"\">Somerset on 4 October</a>. The companies managing the culls were then required only to complete some \"administrative\" steps before culling could begin, but they have not. Farmers are required to deposit enough money to fund the entire four-year cull before beginning, because failing to complete the entire cull is near certain to increase bovine TB. Natural England said not all the money had been deposited, although a spokesman added he did not think the issue was a \"deal-breaker\". He added that the drawing in of winter meant that \"the sooner the cull started, the better.\"</p> <p>The bounty being paid for each badger carcass was revealed to a concerned member of the public by Natural England. The bovine TB licensing unit emailed her: \"When the method employed free shooting, contractors are paid per badger.\"</p> <p>The Whitehall source said: \"Everyone in the department is scrambling with increasing desperation to make an unworkable policy work, so Paterson doesn't look like the failure David Cameron and Nick Clegg saw his predecessor Caroline Spelman as being.\" Paterson has been holding daily meetings on the cull.</p> <p>Further confusion arose on Thursday when Paterson <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2012-10-18/mixed-messages-on-badger-cull-whats-going-on-at-defra/\" title=\"\">twice cancelled a television interview with ITV News</a> for \"logistical reasons\" and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loubgray/statuses/258907397312114688\" title=\"\">Heath cancelled a Friday interview</a> with the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>The cull has prompted the largest animal rights protests since fox hunting was banned in 2004, and more than 150,000 people have signed an e-petition to stop it. The petition has granted opponents of the cull the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/16/badger-cull-commons-debate\" title=\"\">first ever debate in the House of Commons</a>, set for 25 October, where the government will have to vote down a motion to halt the cull.</p>",
  "<p>The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) was born from the broad and market-led premise that corporate reporting should be brought into line with the needs of the 21st century. The global financial crisis means that the world must consider the consequences of living beyond its means for too long \u2013 both economically and environmentally \u2013 and focus on what changes need to be brought about.</p> <p>It is often during times of extreme uncertainty and turbulence that new innovative ideas are formulated \u2013 and with that in mind the IIRC, chaired by Mervyn King, is forging ahead with developing the first internationally accepted framework that will enable businesses to put in place more sustainable systems and processes.</p> <p>Just as governments are exploring whether Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a full expression of a nation's wellbeing and influencing the policy decisions that flow from it, so too businesses are starting to innovate in the way they account for, measure, manage and disclose non-financial as well as financial, factors. Integrated Reporting (IR), draws all of these elements together.</p> <p>Change is not likely to occur overnight \u2013 governments, regulators, standard setters and stock exchange listing authorities will move at different speeds towards establishing guidance and principles for integrating reporting process and practices. But it is clear that companies should view their responsibilities not as a regulatory burden but as a way of attracting long term investment.</p> <p>The IIRC reporting framework will offer guiding principles to businesses formulating their corporate reports, and the support it has received has been extremely encouraging.</p> <p><strong>Does IR mean longer reports?</strong></p> <p>Reactions to the instigation of a new reporting system can lead to the conclusion that reports will become even longer. However, integrated reporting isn't about more reporting but about doing it better.</p> <p>IR is also not part of the new strand of thought that focuses on environmental sustainability, (although this would be incorporated) but about presenting a clear, concise report that ensures investors and other stakeholders have access to relevant information about how business is creating and preserving value in the short, medium and long term. This will mean the breaking down of silos within organisations and allow for integrated thinking.</p> <p>Underpinning IR is the understanding that financial statements, management commentary, governance and remuneration and sustainability reporting are all interdependent.</p> <p><strong>Developing the framework</strong></p> <p>In June the IIRC was among the many organisations represented at the Rio+20 Earth Summit. We were pressing governments to put in place policy mechanisms to enable the accurate measurement of natural capital, so that businesses could begin to manage their use of precious natural resources and integrate this information into corporate reporting cycles.</p> <p>The IIRC are acutely aware, that for tangible change to occur it must be market-led and businesses, investors, accounting bodies and trade associations need to forge the way. One of the most encouraging aspects of the Rio process was the degree to which the private sector was actively pressing for these bolder solutions \u2013 more so than had originally been on the table.</p> <p>The IIRC is a collaboration between businesses, investors, standard setters, regulators and the accounting profession to accelerate IR. In October 2011, the IIRC initiated a pilot programme to support the development of the framework. The programme, which was concluded with a conference for its business and 25 member-investor networks in Amsterdam, is made up of more than 78 global corporate and public sector reporting organisations, including the likes of Unilever, China Light and Power Holdings Ltd and Microsoft. Pilot programme organisations directly provide real-time insights as well as highlighting potential challenges in developing the framework.</p> <p>Different countries are clearly at different stages with diverse obligations to reporting regulators. It is encouraging then, that the businesses above have been forming their own national and regional groups so that similarities and cultural viewpoints can be conveyed back to the IIRC secretariat \u2013 and we can understand the journey certain countries need to embark on.</p> <p>The benefits of IR for businesses are plentiful \u2013 it focuses the organisation on its future orientation and creating value through the business model. However, the main audience for IR is the investor. In recent times, investor decision-making has become short-term and fast-paced. The average time that US institutional investors hold stock in a particular company has fallen from seven years to seven months in the space of a generation. This has led to market instability and has a distorting effect on business decision-making.</p> <p>The instigation of IR would be a powerful tool for investors and would install a culture of transparency, reliability and stability so that investors can begin to trust their money to longer term investments.</p> <p>The framework will be revised and adapted to fit the needs of multiple stakeholder requirements and will be open to public consultation for 90 days in the second quarter of 2013. Version 1.0 will be released in December 2013 once this feedback has been received and processed. From there the IIRC will move into the implantation phase to drive forward the IR framework.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>To an overseas player in Major League Soccer, having your salary made public knowledge seems slightly strange to say the least. Remember the furore when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/nov/01/newsstory.sport6\">John Arne Riise's wage slip was found in a Liverpool street</a> in 2007? Well, twice a year the MLS Players Union releases<a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/October%201,%202012%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf\"> the wage figures of every player in the league</a>, from the newest academy recruit to Thierry Henry. Such a degree of openness is almost impossible to comprehend within a European frame</p> <p>The latest list reaffirms what most people knew or suspected \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/Major-League-Soccer-Players-Union-publishes-latest-round-of-salary-figures.html\">the teams in the biggest media markets are the biggest spenders</a>. New York Red Bulls have three out of four of the highest-paid players in the league in Thierry Henry (No1), Raphael Marquez (No2) and Tim Cahill (No4), and by far the biggest salary outlay of any team (almost $16.75m when guaranteed wages are taken into account). </p> <p>The Los Angeles Galaxy pay out just over $12.7m in guaranteed wages, with David Beckham (No3) heading a golden trio that also includes Robbie Keane (No5) and Landon Donovan (No7). At least those two sides have competitive teams for the money \u2013 Toronto FC may be third place in the spending tables ($7.5m guaranteed), but they are dead last in the Eastern Conference while the side with the second-lowest payroll ($3.25m), Sporting Kansas City, are at the top, challenging for the Supporters Shield - hoping to climb above San Jose Earthquakes ($3.2m).</p> <p>From the outside these figures are always a cause for speculation, if not outright entertainment, with media, fans and bloggers <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/mls/2012/10/5/3458178/mls-player-salary-2012-bargains-busts\">adding columns of their own to the base statistics (SB Nation)</a>, to <a href=\"http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/mls/story/major-league-soccer-week-12-preview-2012-salaries-052512\">rate performance value per dollar (Fox)</a>, often in scathing terms, and with <a href=\"http://www.oregonlive.com/timbers/index.ssf/2012/10/timbers_kris_boyd_among_a_doze.html\">a critical eye on high-priced foreign imports who fail to produce to a degree considered proportionate to younger American team-mates.</a></p> <p>As Bob Foose, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/\">the MLS Players Union</a>, explained: \"It's something we've always done. It's not to our bargaining advantage for it to be kept secret. If anything the owners might want it to be kept secret... Occasionally it can make a player from another country or league uncomfortable, and I can see it could be embarrassing \u2013 but we explain our reasons to them and it has actually been put to the vote by players before, and they've backed it so we'll continue to do it if we think it helps us.\"</p> <p>Foose was speaking in Washington DC, where 180 delegates from players' unions around the world gathered for the FIFpro general assembly - coinciding in the calendar with the slightly more high-profile<a href=\"http://www.leadersinfootball.com/news/\"> Leaders in Football</a> conference in London, featuring the great and good of the global soccer industry.</p> <p>FIFPro is the world players' union. Accordingly, the conversation revolved around collective bargaining agreements, invasive and ineffective doping monitoring, player healthcare and pensions, intimidation of players in inadequately regulated territories and numerous other unglamorous but vital components of the daily administration and culture of the game.</p> <p>The London conference, held at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge home, featured contributions from the MLS commissioner Don Garber, Portland Timbers owner Merritt Paulson and Seattle Sounders owner Adrian Hanauer, as well as league officials and experienced general managers and CEOs such as Philadelphia's Nick Sakiewicz. Subjects included the MLS strategy to become a top league by 2022, the ever-vexed subject of the MLS calendar being out of synch with Fifa, and the sport's burgeoning profile in the USA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397982926\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350065414006/Bob_Foose_MLS_Players_Union_140.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Foose MLS Players Union\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Foose. Photo: St\u00e9phane St-Raymond/FIFPro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: St\u00e9phane St-Raymond/St\u00e9phane St-Raymond/FIFPro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The players' event was facilitated by the MLS Players Union \u2013 a major coup for Foose. Ironically, even in representing players from such a young league, Foose and his team were relative veterans at the assembly, compared to delegates and observers from countries such as the Czech Republic \u2013 whose union, chaired by the ex-Manchester United player Karel Poborsky, was ratified by FIFPro at this year's event.</p> <p>The MLS Players Union found itself entering the conference with its profile \u2013 generally modest outside the saber-rattling periods leading up to collective bargaining agreements (the last MLS CBA was ratified in March 2010) \u2013 at one of its periodic highs, thanks to last week's publication of <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/October%201,%202012%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf\">the latest round of player salary figures</a>. </p> <p>Whatever the embarrassment felt in the locker room, the figures certainly cause a certain amount of embarrassment for the executives, as they pursue their goals of market share in their own country, let alone international credibility, with this aspect of their inner workings very much on public display.</p> <p>The counter-argument from the players is that this transparency, within the arcane system of salary caps, designated players and the daddy of all esoterica, <a href=\"http://majorleaguesoccertalk.com/2012/09/05/mls-economics-end-the-salary-cap-mystery/\">allocation money</a>, is a useful tool in benchmarking their contribution and ensuring their fair share of proceeds as the MLS business grows. Crudely put, to attract the media attention and TV deals it needs for that growth, MLS has to produce the figures that confirm it's on track. At which point the MLS Players Union can point to the salary figures to show the players enjoy a more or less equitable share of that pie at any given moment. The stats consistently make clear the very modest salaries of many of the players working in MLS \u2013 and in doing so perhaps help underpin the union mandate.</p> <p>There is also an argument that the publication of the salaries, while potentially embarrassing for underperforming high earners and the people who pay them, can also be leveraged the other way. Mauro Rosales at Seattle had a breakout season in 2011 <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/May%201,%202011%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf\">on a league minimum wage of $42K</a>. He is back in 2012 as a designated player, albeit one whose basic wage, while much improved to a guaranteed $225,000, does not compare to other players in the league carrying the DP tag (his salary is significantly supplemented by a series of add-ons that keep the Sounders under the cap and Rosales happy not to have permanently undervalued himself with a poor year at the cut rate). </p> <p>Chris Wondolowski can also rely on a fair amount of local public opinion being behind him when he states his case that he should be a $1m-per-annum designated player next year, instead of earning the $300,000 that has bought San Jose 25-goals-and-counting this season. Wondolowski can also point to the very publicly documented years he spent as a development player for much less money and make a very reasonable case that in the limited window he has to make money for himself and his family, he is probably entering the last year to make such a deal for himself.</p> <p>But as the FIFPro delegates met in Washington to represent organized labor within the global game, they were at pains to emphasize that the point is not the more eye-catching individual salaries on offer \u2013 whether in the upper echelons of the English or Spanish leagues, or the comparatively modest outlays in the American game \u2013 but the collective bargaining power of players negotiating en masse, as the MLS Players Union did in 2004 (<a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/collective_bargaining_agreement__final.pdf\">full agreement here</a>) and 2010 to secure the collective bargaining agreements that secured healthcare and pension rights, and certain concessions on player movement.</p> <p>Also at the FIFPro conference, DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the <a href=\"https://www.nflplayers.com\">NFL Players Association</a>, and Michael Weiner, his <a href=\"http://mlbplayers.mlb.com/pa/index.jsp\">MLB equivalent</a>, had outlined their respective struggles towards their sports' CBAs in recent years. (Don Fehr, their NHL counterpart, was originally scheduled to appear but, ironically, he has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/04/nhl-lockout-league-cancels-two-weeks\">a lockout</a> to contend with.) </p> <p>The global delegates and observers, assembled from countries as diverse as Malta, Indonesia and Palestine, all had horror stories about organizing for the vast majority of players for whom multi-million dollar salaries are a pipe dream, but even they seemed to balk at some of the descriptions of the routine practices permitted under American labor law, such as the idea of the lockout as a standard \"technique\" of owners in the negotiating process. </p> <p>For Smith and the NFLPA <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/the-side/football-column/nfl-lockout-2011-issues-5471398\">the memories were recent and bruising</a>. For MLB's Weiner, the last decade's CBA negotiations have been a relatively straightforward process fueled by meticulous preparation of his members, starting two years out from negotiations, the significant fact that no salary cap exists in the league, and of course <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994\u201395_Major_League_Baseball_strike\">the bruising folk memory of the 232 day stoppage of 1994-95</a>, which fuels a current wary respect between owners and players. </p> <p>When I spoke last month to Todd Durbin, the MLS vice-president who has negotiated virtually every contract in MLS, he seemed to share such wary respect for his union counterparts, despite the memory of what had been a draining and emotional battle for all parties in working towards the last CBA, when <a href=\"http://www.ussoccerplayers.com/ussoccerplayers/2010/03/mls-announces-cba-changes.html\">the threat of a work stoppage was only narrowly averted</a>.</p> <p>\"When you're dealing with labor issues you're dealing with peoples' lives,\" he said. \"It's not like a commercial transaction, you're talking about creating an environment that everybody has to live in after the fact. So the goal is not to win, because you have to live with whatever it is you've built afterwards. So the goal is not for us to win, it's not for them to win, it's to build an environment that gives us the best chance to make the business successful. We're all sort of growing up together, and to [the players'] credit... they're smart and they're tough, but they have a genuine interest in building the business. And the players do as well, and they deserve a lot of credit.\"</p> <p>Durbin's is a much more sanguine take than some governing-body attitudes that were described at the FIFPro assembly \u2013 the power plays and \"choke out\" moves, as one speaker put it. Of course, the MLS model is structured on a sense of shared enterprise that can, eventually, be successfully appealed to in player/management negotiations, but that doesn't mean that the size and rights to that share are not a matter for continuous contestation, some of it extremely heated. </p> <p>With the next MLS CBA due to be negotiated in 2014, this period of mutual respect could yet come to look like a golden age in labor relations. Last week though, the players and the owners were in their huddles, separated by the Atlantic.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Cavendish has left Team Sky, a departure that had been widely telegraphed since the penultimate day of the Tour de France, when the team principal, Dave Brailsford, acknowledged that he would be free to leave. A three-year deal with the Belgian squad Omega Pharma-Quickstep was finally confirmed on Thursday.</p> <p>The 27-year-old Manxman's move to the Belgian squad signals the end of a working relationship which has been key to his career. The Guardian understands that Cavendish and his coach Rod Ellingworth, who is the race coach at Sky, will no longer work together, because Ellingworth will remain at the British team.</p> <p>Ellingworth and the Manx sprinter have been close since Cavendish joined the British Cycling academy in 2004 and it was Ellingworth who masterminded Cavendish's victory in the 2011 world road race championship in Copenhagen and was also the brains behind his win in the 2009 Milan-San Remo.</p> <p>How the end of that working relationship will affect Cavendish remains to be seen, but what is certain is that the breakdown in the relationship between the former world champion and Team Sky came at the Tour de France. The issue of whether Sky could accommodate both Cavendish's aim of winning the green jersey and Bradley Wiggins's goal of taking yellow had been a live one since Cavendish's signing at the British team the previous October. It was at the centre of a dispute over the final composition of the team for the Tour \u2013 with the debate being how many riders should be included to assist the Manxman in the sprint finishes&#xa0;\u2013 and it came to a head during the Tour.</p> <p>Cavendish won three stages during the race, including two in the last three days, where he received a huge amount of assistance from Wiggins, who was wearing the yellow jersey at that point. However, he has since said that in his view he could have won three more stages if Team Sky had been entirely dedicated to his service. These include the stages from Samatan to Pau, where Sky were unwilling to chase down the day's escape because it would have tired their <em>domestiques </em>in advance of the Pyrenees, and the finish at Cap d'Agde, where Cavendish felt he could have remained in contact with the peloton had Sky worked for him.</p> <p>It appears that the situation created tensions within the team, and the day before the end of the Tour Brailsford took the unexpected step of stating that his sprinter might have to leave. \"I wouldn't say Mark has been unhappy,\" Brailsford said, \"but he's a prolific winner who has come to this event and dominated it. I think when he forgoes some of that, it's always going to be a challenge for him. If he wasn't frustrated a little by that, you would want to know why. If he felt or if it was felt that he wants a dedicated team around him, then he is quite within his rights to do that.\"</p> <p>After the Tour, Cavendish clearly acknowledged that he would be on the move, saying: \"It would be wrong of me not to want the best for Team Sky and for British cycling, but me staying with the team restricts both them and also what I want to do.\"</p> <p>On Thursday Cavendish said he was moving \"to pursue different goals\", adding: \"I believe in the team's project and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.\"</p> <p>His move to Omega means that Cavendish will be reunited with a key figure from his past, his former <em>directeur sportif </em>at the HTC team Brian Holm. Holm was in the Great Britain car at the Copenhagen world championships and had worked with Cavendish since he turned professional at the T-Mobile squad in 2007. Omega are led by the Belgian one-day Classic specialist Tom Boonen, with whom Cavendish is unlikely to have the same clash of priorities that arose at Sky, as the Briton will target the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia.</p> <p>Brailsford said: \"Mark has been a true champion for Team Sky this year. It's been an honour having the rainbow jersey in this team and great to work so closely with a rider I've known since he was a junior. He has been a real team player, making history in a Tour de France winning team.</p> <p>\"Cav won 15 races with us, including his first stage race, three Tour stages, and the fourth win in his unbeaten run on the Champs Elysees.

They wrote:</p> <blockquote> Following the end of energy price discounting and doorstep selling, the prime minister appeared effectively to kill customer switching yesterday when he announced that all energy retailers would be forced by law to give customers the cheapest tariffs. While actual proposed legislation seems not to involve compulsion, political tolerance of retail profits is dwindling. </blockquote> <p>They suggest there would be limited scope for customer switching in the new regime, which could hit margins at energy companies.</p> <blockquote> If regulation replaces competition to control margins, allowed profits could be squeezed given the very limited capital involved in retailing. </blockquote> <p>The companies most at risk from this are Centrica and SSE, they say, rating both of the stocks a 'hold. Centrica was unchanged, while SSE dropped 1.8% to \u00a314.32.</p> <p>Deutsche prefer United Utilities as a defensive stock, or Drax as it sells to the wholesale market and not residential customers.

  "<p>The dramatic switch from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/05/hosepipe-bans-southern-eastern-england\" title=\"\">drought and hosepipe bans in England</a> this spring to the wettest April to June ever and widespread flooding was of a magnitude never seen before, water experts said on Thursday.</p> <p>While water supplies have made \"dramatic\" recoveries from droughts before, such as in 1975-76, \"sustained recoveries of this magnitude during the late spring and summer have not been seen before,\" said Terry Marsh, from the <a href=\"http://www.ceh.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH)</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.ceh.ac.uk/news/news_archive/UK-Hydrological-Summary-September_2012_52.html\" title=\"\">the CEH said</a> that following the wet summer, groundwater levels were above and \"well above\" the average for early autumn.</p> <p>The Environment Agency (EA), which is responsible for drought measures and flood defences, said the extreme weather showed the need for the UK to adopt greater resilience to protect homes, roads and power stations.</p> <p>Christine Tuckett of the EA said: \"The weather extremes which we've seen this year \u2013 with widespread floods almost immediately following a long-term drought \u2013 have brought the importance of resilience into sharp focus. Taking action today to prepare and adapt our homes, businesses, and infrastructure is vital.\"</p> <p>Sarah Jackson, chief adviser to the government at the Met Office, was reported by the Press Association as saying: \"We are coming into a period [November to April] which is traditionally the wetter period. Because the ground is so wet, if we do have any prolonged heavy rainfall in any part of the country, there is going to be heightened risk.\"</p> <p>Thousands of homes across the country have been hit by flooding in the past few months, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\" title=\"\">Guardian revealing in July</a> that hundreds of flood defences have gone unbuilt due to budget cuts.

  "<p>It's not quite \"What did you do in the war, Daddy?\" or even \"Where were you when Mary Berry <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/16/great-british-bake-off-john-whaite\" title=\"\">marvelled at a lovely sausage on the Great British Bake Off</a>?\" \u2013 but do you remember when Come Dine With Me was an afternoon treat? How we laughed at narrator Dave Lamb's caustic comments; marvelled at the delusions of the few competitors who couldn't throw a penny in a well, never mind a dinner party; delighted in deciphering the carefully-coded classifications of contestants. (For those wondering: \"party girl\" \u2013 will have sex for booze; \"bon viveur\" \u2013 ugly but wealthy, probably has gout; \"ladies' man\" \u2013 compulsive onanist and porn addict.) </p> <p>Back in 2005, Come Dine With Me was an undiscovered gem in Channel 4's daytime schedule. Now, alas, it seems like a gaudy commodity: broadcast a whopping 126 times in one month on Channel 4, More4 and 4Seven, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/come-dine-with-me-to-be-screen-126-on-channel-1382743\" title=\"\">the Mirror reports</a>, in a move that critics say is indicative of Channel 4's creative bankruptcy.</p> <p>While this may be over-egging the pudding somewhat \u2013 you might want to brace yourself for a whole lot more foodie puns \u2013 CDWM has bloomed like a beanstalk since it was first broadcast. Moving from daytime to compressed primetime and then to teatime, daytime <em>and</em> primetime, it has spawned More4 marathons, celebrity editions and merchandising. Not only one of the UK's most successful global formats, it has also inspired imitations and derivations: notably SkyLiving's Four Weddings and Channel 4's Four in a Bed. (We shall back away from The Devil's Dinner Party, like cats from vomit.)</p> <p>You can't blame Channel 4 for capitalising on the success of CDWM, with its simple premise \u2013 dinner parties are arenas in which petty competitiveness and small snobberies pervade proceedings \u2013 that has proven irresistible to viewers. The issue is one of extent: the show's ubiquity will surely lead audiences to sicken of it more quickly than if the channel had enforced strict portion control.</p> <p>But perhaps the show's real problem is the change in its recipe. It's not so much that we've had too many helpings of Come Dine With Me but rather that it's gone from appetiser to emetic.</p> <p>In its early days, the show was as much about the food as it was about the personalities involved. That Scottish man's pigs' trotters notwithstanding, there were a fair few recipes that you might have considered making. Now the food feels almost an afterthought to the inevitable rifling through folks' wardrobes for racy, lacey knickers; rummaging in bedside cabinets for the dildo drawer and laying on inevitably excruciating themed entertainment. (Let's not even start on the inexplicably high proportion of dinners that end in hot tubs).</p> <p>Downgrading the cooking in favour of increasingly tacky casting of self-consciously \"wacky\" people arguably has more to do with programme-makers becoming bored with the CDWM formula than viewers. Had the show remained unadulterated rather than packed full of additives such as shouty vegan strippers, I'd wager it would have a great deal more life left in it now.</p> <p>But whatever the problem \u2013 that we've gorged on it like geese on gavage or that its format has, like so much reality TV, fallen foul of the observer effect \u2013 there can't be anyone who imagines that the once tasty Come Dine With Me is not a flavour rapidly falling out of favour.</p>",
  "<p>The Foreign Office has opened a new crisis centre to help rescue British citizens trapped abroad by political upheavals or natural disasters, in an effort to prevent a repeat of the delays in evacuating Britons from Libya last year.</p> <p>The evacuation fiasco in February 2011 left hundreds of UK nationals in Tripoli, Benghazi and in the desert oilfields after airlines cancelled flights. The government found it hard to find chartered planes to replace them, and one of them broke down before take-off, drawing an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/24/libya-plane-britons-lands-uk\" title=\"\">apology from the prime minister</a> and prompting the foreign secretary, William Hague, to order a review of evacuation procedures.</p> <p>\"The problems themselves were difficult to foresee. At one point, a series of aircraft didn't fly for a variety of reasons including technical breakdown. But whenever things like that happen we have to be better prepared next time, so I think things like that were a clear lesson that some things had to be changed and improved,\" Hague said.</p> <p>\"The main practical lesson was even more redundancy. If you've got a plane going to rescue people, you need another one that is on standby. Or another two. If you think you're going to need two, you perhaps need four. These are always difficult decisions because the more planes you have the more expensive it is. You need more redundancy, more capacity to deal with these events.\"</p> <p>The crisis centre, <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?id=823026682&amp;view=News\" title=\"\">in the basement of the Foreign Office</a>, has a video wall so that multiple live feeds can be projected at the same time. At the launch event it displayed a map of the world showing 13 countries where British officials have rehearsed crisis and evacuation procedures over the past years.</p> <p>The centre is equipped with interactive whiteboards that allow maps of the crisis region to be called up and marked with evacuation plans which are then sent to British missions around the world.</p> <p>A feed of information comes in from government agencies such as the <a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Geological Survey</a>, for information on earthquakes and tsunamis, and the <a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Health Protection Agency</a>, for information on any emerging pandemics, for example. Digital clocks on the walls display the time in the Maldives, Cairo, Washington, Hong Kong, London and Mexico.</p> <p>The aim of the centre, which has a permanent staff of 28 and a total surge capacity of 110, is to be able to handle two global crises at the same time. Hague said that drew on the other lesson from 2011, which was that crises did not necessarily come along one at a time.</p> <p>\"There was the New Zealand earthquake and the Japan tsunami which were very close to each other,\" the foreign secretary said. \"The sheer volume of events and the numbers of British nationals caught up in a whole series of political events and natural disasters \u2026 that's made it necessary to upgrade the crisis centre.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office has also created a new rapid deployment team for the Middle East and south Asia, which will include consular issues, counsellors, logistics experts and, when necessary, police disaster victims identification units, and can now draw on more than 170 trained volunteers from Foreign Office staff who can be deployed around the world at a few hours' notice.</p> <p>\"People often ask what do you do when you're not in crisis, and I say we almost always are dealing with a crisis,\" said Juliet Maric, head of the crisis management department. \"There is almost always something we are watching or monitoring or tracking, or if not we are planning and preparing or training and exercising.\"</p>",

  "<p>It's cold and windy outside. The lure of getting into my cosy car \u2013 rather than on to my chilly bike \u2013 for the three-mile journey to the office is strong. What will make me sacrifice my own comfort, make me decide not to add unnecessary CO2 into the air?</p> <p>The real struggle I am going through, psychologists would say, is between the ego and the \"better self\". Better self says: think of the planet, air quality, global warming and the eventual grandchildren. Ego says: cycling in the cold will make me irritable, the wind will mess my hair and I'm tired \u2026</p> <p>Clearly a dose of egotism, and putting ourselves first is needed for our survival and self-protection. But here is the catch: if we are to survive as a species, we also need the opposite: a lot of people not to get into cars or aeroplanes, to tune in to their \"better selves\", to put the larger interests of generations of people they will never meet before their own immediate needs.</p> <p>Psychologists have called the source of such thinking the \"higher self\" \u2013 the self which \"transcends that part of us that dwells on petty things that cause fear \u2026 and allows you to become more compassionate,\" says Dr Susan Jeffers, author of Feel The Fear And Do It Any Way.</p> <h2>Feeling fulfilled</h2> <p>If we stop to tap into the better or higher self inside each one of us, she says, we feel more connected to others and the wider world and are more able to think expansively. \"This place, when tapped, allows us to feel fulfilled,\" Jeffers says. Crucially, it allows us to take responsibility.</p> <p>Throughout the centuries, virtually every religious and humanistic belief system has some version of altruism as a central tenet: from Judaism, which says altruism is the desired goal of creation, to the <a href=\"http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar_url?hl=en&amp;q=http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D2930%26context%3Dcolpub_review&amp;sa=X&amp;scisig=AAGBfm0c2bodHkFRFpcWkvvCNwNDs3v5HA&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;ei=TN1-UKKcNIW-0QXnhIAo&amp;ved=0CCAQgAMoAjAA\" title=\"\">Ethical Altruism Movement</a> which maintains altruism is a moral obligation for everyone.</p> <p>\"When we tap into our altruistic selves we behave and act differently,\" says Katie Duckworth who coaches leaders in the not-for-profit sector. \"We are in a different zone, more likely to take responsibility for things that are beyond our own family's needs. I believe everyone has, and can, access a better self.\"</p> <p>But, clearly, the human race has not found it easy to do this. We have seen the environmental catastrophe on the horizon for a long time, but so many of us are still looking at our feet.</p> <p>So how do we tap into our better selves? \"It all comes from our personal values,\" says Duckworth. \"If you are focused on self-enhancement, you are more likely to take actions that perpetuate that \u2013 for example, consume goods that feed your need for approval.\"</p> <h2>Early values</h2> <p>How do we get the \"right\" values? Psychologists say our values are formed early in life and are not consciously chosen \u2013 although we can react against them later in life. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Gerhardt\" title=\"\">Sue Gerhardt</a>, author of The Selfish Society, says the only reliable way to make society less selfish is to improve early parenting and that crucial early modelling: \"If we want to have a more caring society \u2026 we have to address the culture of child rearing which is where the ability to respond to others' needs begins.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the battle with our better selves goes back to the beginning of time \u2013 to the story of Adam and Eve, Apollo and Dionysus in ancient Greece, through to Freud's id, ego and super-ego. Thinkers today \u2013 whether psychologists, academics or politicians \u2013 are still concerned by it. What is fascinating is how similar the ways are that environmental psychologists and politicians looking for the green vote describe us \u2013 and all with huge echoes from the past: self-transcendent or self-enhancing?</p> <p>Studies by psychologists <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedemann_Schulz_von_Thun\" title=\"\">Shultz </a>et al group us into those who tend towards self-transcendence (more concerned about the environment) and those who tend towards self-enhancement (less concerned). Others divide us into those whose environmental attitudes are based on:</p> <p>a) concern for self (egoistic)</p> <p>b) concern for other people (social-altruistic)</p> <p>c) concern for plants and animals (biospheric)</p> <h2>Settler, prospector or pioneer?</h2> <p>With echoes of the Wild West, David Miliband's advisers grouped us into <a href=\"http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/valuesmodes.html\" title=\"\">settlers, prospectors and pioneers</a>. Pioneers (41% of Britons in 2011) are global, networked, like innovation and believe in the importance of ethics. Prospectors (28%) like success, ambition and seek the esteem of others. Settlers (31%) see things in terms of right and wrong, avoid change, seek personal security and needs and have a strong sense of place.</p> <p>So we have not changed much: some people think big, some people think small. To survive more of us need to think bigger.

  "<p>Confusion over David Cameron's commitment to forcing energy companies to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/energy-tariff-plans-under-pressure\" title=\"\">place customers on their lowest tariffs</a> deepened on Thursday, with neither the energy secretary nor the energy minister able to explain its meaning.</p> <p>Instead, the climate and energy secretary, Ed Davey, pointed to a voluntary agreement brokered with energy companies in April to inform customers about cheaper tariffs. Asked whether the prime minister's pledge meant energy companies would only be able to offer one tariff \u2013 the cheapest \u2013 he said: \"[Ensuring] consumers face the lowest bills possible is a priority for me. We have been in discussions across government. Ofgem has been talking about fewer tariffs and simpler bills and that is the direction of travel.\"</p> <p>The Guardian can confirm that Davey knew nothing about Cameron's pledge before it was made.</p> <p>Energy minister John Hayes was summoned to the House of Commons to answer an urgent question from Labour. He was unable to confirm Cameron's announcement, instead saying the government would legislate to \"help\" get the best deal. \"There are a number of options that are being considered, for example [the April agreement] which will be evaluated to see if we should make legislation binding,\" Hayes told MPs. \"This is a complicated area and we will discuss it with the industry, consumer groups and the regulator in order to work through the detail.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he knew what was going to be announced, Hayes said: \"Of course we understand what the prime minister was considering because we have been debating and discussing the provisions of the energy bill for months.\"</p> <p>The shadow energy secretary, Caroline Flint, said Cameron's intervention had thrown the government's policy into \"confusion\" and \"caused chaos\" in the industry.</p> <p>Neil Bentley, deputy director general of the CBI, which is urging the government to end its feud over energy policy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">back the green economy</a>, told the Guardian: \"We are seeking policy clarity like everybody else. If competition is to work, consumers have to have a choice of tariffs. I'm not quite sure where the prime minister was coming from.\"</p> <p>The confusion over Cameron's announcement comes as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/17/energy-policy-coalition-green-agenda\" title=\"\">infighting over energy reached the \"quad\"</a> \u2013 Cameron, George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander \u2013 that runs the coalition. The chancellor is believed to be seeking to limit investment in renewable energy and promote a new \"dash for gas\", while the Liberal Democrats are seeking a new carbon-cutting target for 2030 to be included in the forthcoming energy bill, due in November.</p> <p>Greenpeace's executive director, John Sauven, said: \"The government's energy policy is now as confusing as British Gas tariffs. Osborne must listen to the CBI's latest warning that capping investment in clean energy will only mean more gas and higher bills.\"</p> <p>Davey has dissociated himself from the <a href=\"http://ind.pn/RWbmPW\" title=\"\">\"green Taliban\" insult</a> reportedly used by the chancellor to disparage those supporting the fast-growing green economy. He said: \"I have found green NGOs extremely helpful and constructive. They have a really important role to play.\"</p>",
  "<p>Newsweek is to axe its print edition after 80 years and move to digital-only from the new year.</p> <p>Tina Brown, the editor-in-chief of Newsweek and sister digital news site the Daily Beast, told staff in an email that the last print edition will appear on 31 December.</p> <p>The new digital-only publication, which will be called Newsweek Global, will be a \"single worldwide edition targeted for a highly mobile, opinion-leading audience who want to learn about world events in a sophisticated context\".</p> <p>Newsweek Global will be supported by paid subscriptions, with content available for e-readers, tablets and the web, with some content also available on the Daily Beast.</p> <p>Brown, a former editor of the New Yorker and Vanity Fair, said that the shift to digital will lead to staff cuts and a downsizing of the business internationally.</p> <p>\"The inexorable move to an all-digital Newsweek comes with an unfortunate reality,\" she said in an <a href=\"http://newsweek.tumblr.com/post/33830925419/memo-from-tina-brown-to-all-staff-re-newsweeks\" title=\"\">email to staff on Thursday</a>. \"Regrettably we anticipate staff reductions and the streamling of our editorial and business operations both here in the US and internationally.\"</p> <p>Brown was quick to point out that the cuts and move to digital was not about saying \"goodbye\" to Newsweek, but responding to the reality of the costs of maintaining a print publication.</p> <p>\"We are transitioning Newsweek, not saying goodbye to it,\" she said. \"We remain committed to Newsweek and to the journalism that it represents. This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism, that is as powerful as ever. It is about the challenging economics of print publishing and distribution.\"</p> <p>Newsweek, which was saved for closure by the late Sidney Harman when he bought it for $1 from the Washington Post in August 2010, was swiftly merged with Brown's Daily Beast in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/nov/12/tina-brown-daily-beast-newsweek?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">50/50 joint venture later that same year</a>.</p> <p>Brown launched the Daily Beast \u2013 which is named from her favourite novel, Evelyn Waugh's Scoop \u2013 in 2008 with the backing of Barry Diller's InterActiveCorp.</p> <p>\"Newsweek is produced by a gifted and tireless team of professionals who have been offering brilliant work consistently throughout a tough period of ownership transition and media disruption,\" she said.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Brown batted down reports that the print edition was doomed in an email titled \"scaremongering\". But in an <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2012/10/18/tinabrown/\">interview with the Wall Street Journal</a> on Thursday, she confirmed the move had been in the works for some time. She said: \"We have been exploring it since June in a very aggressive way, because all the industry trends have told us that it was only a question of when, not if\u2026. It became increasingly important to us to embrace our future rather than just keep talking about it.\"</p> <p>Some commentators have been critical of Brown's stewardship of the magazine. \"Brown's Newsweek has been a bit of a disaster, really, and it started to truly fall apart last fall, amid reports of internal tumult at the magazine,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2012/10/6538400/tina-browns-newsweek-takes-leap-future-which-oblivion\">Tom McGeveran at Capital New York.</a></p> <p>But the Gawker founder Nick Denton placed the blame on Diller. You have to go back to Talk to find Tina Brown's last failure. Since then, Diller has acquired a slew of companies and mismanaged them into irrelevance. Match.com, Ask Jeeves, the list goes on. Now watch him manage the decline of About.com,\" <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5952894/the-hagfish-strikes-again?post=53650774\">he wrote</a>.</p> <p>Felix Salmon, the financial blogger for Reuters, <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/10/18/why-keep-newsweek-on-life-support/\">doubted the new digital Newsweek would work</a>. \"The chances that Newsweek will succeed as a digital-only subscription-based publication are exactly zero ...

Many of those abducted were almost certainly dead, while others were alive and being held in Syrian prisons or secret detention centres where they were tortured, the groups claimed.</p> <p>Since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011, government forces had \"disappeared\" peaceful protesters on an unprecedented scale, the groups said. Some campaigners have estimated the number of those who have vanished could be as high as 80,000.</p> <p>A harrowing film released on Thursday by the global campaign network Avaaz shows disturbing footage of forced disappearances. In one incident, three soldiers grab two women dressed in black abayas walking down a street. They hit them and drag them away. In another, soldiers abduct a Syrian man, yanking him by the hair past a tank.</p> <p>Alice Jay, Avaaz's campaign director, said: \"Syrians are being plucked off the street by Syrian security forces and paramilitaries and being 'disappeared' into torture cells. Whether it is women buying groceries or farmers going for fuel, nobody is safe.</p> <p>\"This is a deliberate strategy to terrorise families and communities \u2013 the panic of not knowing whether your husband or child is alive breeds such fear that it silences dissent. The fate of each and every one of these people must be investigated and the perpetrators punished.\"</p> <p>Victims were not members of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA), which is fighting government forces on numerous fronts. Instead, they were civilians or peaceful protesters whom the authorities suspected of sympathising with the opposition. Some were abducted from their homes after midnight, others seized at military checkpoints. None were seen again.</p> <p>Fadel Abdulghani, of the Syrian Network for Human Rights which has been monitoring the death toll in Syria since the protests began, said the group had collected 18,000 names of people who had disappeared. It had information but no names for 10,000 more cases, as the families had been too afraid to share them, it said.</p> <p>Muhammad Khalil, a human rights lawyer from the city of Hasaka in north-eastern Syria, said: \"While there is no precise figure, thousands of people have disappeared since March last year. The regime is doing this for two reasons: to directly get rid of the rebels and activists, and to intimidate the society so that it won't oppose the regime.\"</p> <p>Avaaz said it had spoken to numerous friends and relatives of people who had been forcibly disappeared. It said it would hand over these cases to the UN human rights council, which investigates such abuses. Forced disappearances are a crime against humanity and can be tried in the international criminal court.</p> <p>Many people talk about the uncertainty of not knowing their relatives' fate. Mais, whose husband Anas was forcibly disappeared in Talkalakh in February this year, said: \"The children need a father in their lives. It has been difficult to adapt. I have had a very hard time explaining his absence. They always ask me: 'Where is Dad? Who took him?' And I don't know how to respond. I have to lie to them. I tell them he is at work, that he is OK.\"</p> <p>Others describe how their loved ones went missing. Ahmad Ghassan Ibrahim, 26, from the village of Qala'at al-Hosn, near Homs, vanished on 27 February. &#xa0;His mother, Fayzeh al-Masri, said: \"My son drove his car from Qala'at al-Hosn to the city of Talkalakh. It was then when we lost contact with him. He called his aunt at 10.30pm from a number other than his&#xa0;\u2026We later found out that the number Ahmad called us from belongs to the military security branch in Homs. We asked almost every security branch about him, to no avail.</p> <p>\"A month and a half ago we called his cellphone and someone answered, saying that Ahmad was killed by a regime sniper and buried in Rastan, but we were not able to confirm this information. We have been seriously concerned for six months. We are certain that he would not have left us or his wife, who is expecting twins. We only want to know his fate.\"</p> <p>The tactic of forced disappearances is not new. Assad's father, Hafez, carried out a bloody crackdown between 1979 and 1982 \u2013 about 7,000 of those victims are still missing. During the \"dirty war\" in Argentina from 1977-83, it is estimated that as many as 30,000 people disappeared under the ruling military junta. Throughout the Algerian civil war from 1992-97, it is claimed as many as 17,000 people were forcibly disappeared.</p>",

Ahead of her pending assessment for the DLA replacement, PIP, Lee writes about <a href=\"http://mybagladylife.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/a-walk-in-park.html\" title=\"\">the changes since her first DLA award 20 years ago</a>. She looks at the issues faced by those with fluctuating conditions, and the pressure she feels to conceal the good days (\"...days that are amazing. Days when I can walk to and then around my local park, watching kids play and parents shout at them. When I can touch trees and feel grass between my toes if I take my shoes off.\") And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I refuse to buy in to this Atos-inspired way of thinking. I won't accept that I should wallow in my disease and take to my bed for ever more so that they'll give me a fairly small amount of money every week and allow me to keep my blue badge. What kind of a society is this that this Coalition is building? A society where those of us who are sick or disabled should be defined by those things? I will not do it. I'm not going to play. I'm going to carry on celebrating my good days ... I will continue to cherish going out and having coffees and lunches with friends; I will carry on getting stupidly excited about using public transport and marvelling at the Oyster card system. I'm still going to get a buzz out of walking to the corner shop just a couple of hundred yards from my house \u2013 I say walking, it may look like that from the outside but in my heart it's still so much of a novelty for me that I feel like I'm flying to the local Londis. After a couple of decades of not being able to do those things at all, I'm grabbing my right to love doing them with both hands and anybody who thinks I should do otherwise can go join the Tory party. <br>Is Atos really going to punish us for doing this? For trying to be well and 'normal', instead of sick and crippled and downtrodden? Is this what Cameron's big society wants from those of us who aren't completely able-bodied? Because if it is, there's something far more rotten and insidious going on than anybody is admitting to, and certainly there's more than enough horrors that we already know about. Like an inverse Robin Hood, this government is taking from the poorest and weakest and giving to the rich fat cats, and how can that be right? This isn't meant to be a rant about government, though I suppose that's an inevitable by-product; it's meant to be a spleen-vent about the impotence forced upon those of us who just want to work and have that bit extra we need to live on, so that we can. Those of us who want to be well and functional and a useful part of society. Most of us, really, when you think about it.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Police blogger Mental Health Cop on this week's edition of Channel 4 series <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/999-whats-your-emergency/4od#3421247\" title=\"\">999 What's Your Emergency?</a>. The series follows police, fire and ambulance teams in Blackpool and this week looked at the issue of <strong>mental health</strong>. Inspector Michael Brown, who writes the blog, notes that call handler in the programme used terms like \"fruitloop\", and adds \"I could do without hearing \"These people\" to refer to everyone (in the country or the world?!) with mental health problems.\" <a href=\"http://mentalhealthcop.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/999-whats-your-emergency/\" title=\"\">Mental ill-health incidents are core police business</a>, says Brown, but there is a bigger issue: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Policing is only necessary at all because some people don't self-police. The existence of an alcohol industry and many of our fellow subjects' inability to drink and behave responsibly forces untold costs upon the public purse and causes mass demand for policing and emergency medical services.

  "<p>David Cameron's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/17/energy-firms-forced-lowest-tariff\" title=\"\">announcement yesterday that the government would legislate to force energy companies to put customers on their lowest tariffs</a> sounded good for a couple of hours. But by last night <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/energy-tariff-plans-under-pressure\" title=\"\">it had unravelled</a>. Even consumer groups argued that it was unworkable and would destroy what little competition there is in the energy market, forcing prices up not down.</p> <p>It neatly symbolised the current disarray in the government's energy policy, which is fast approaching crisis point. As it prepares to publish its long-awaited <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">energy bill</a>, the choice at stake could not be more critical: whether Britain moves towards a low-carbon energy system that contributes to tackling climate change, or a continuing fossil fuel-based one that locks in high greenhouse gas emissions for the next 40 years.</p> <p>The bill will set out a new system for regulation of Britain's energy market. The task is to give the private energy sector the incentive to install the \u00a3100bn-plus of investment needed to keep the lights on, replacing ageing power stations and upgrading transmission grids, while keeping energy prices competitive.</p> <p>Given the different needs of different technologies \u2013 principally renewables, nuclear and gas \u2013 this was never going to be easy. But in the past few months a huge fissure has opened up in the coalition, that has left the bill drafting process in complete confusion. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/george-osborne-letter-ed-davey-gas-wind\" title=\"\">a leaked letter in July</a>, the chancellor, George Osborne, told the energy secretary, Ed Davey, that support for renewables should be capped, and Britain should meet its energy needs instead through a major expansion of gas-fired power.</p> <p>Davey might have resisted. Instead, he acceded to the chancellor's demand and last month announced a new \"dash for gas\", <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/gas-fired-power-stations-uk\" title=\"\">with 20 new gas-fired power stations to be built over the next 20 years</a>. Since ministers cannot decide how many gas power stations get built (the energy companies do that), the announcement could only have been a signal that the incentives for renewables would be cut.</p> <p>The result has been uproar. With the UK's low-carbon energy goals apparently to be cast aside, the energy companies, their investors, and the green technology businesses which supply them have been left facing huge uncertainty about their own futures.</p> <p>The choice between gas and renewables is not absolute. Gas is a flexible fuel which can supply the back-up needed when wind and solar are not flowing. With carbon capture and storage (CCS), it can even become low-carbon. If coal-fired plants were phased out more quickly \u2013 the best way of cutting emissions \u2013 there is certainly room for more gas. But Osborne and his supporters on the right of the Conservative party, backed by strident campaigning by the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph, explicitly reject both back-up capacity and CCS, and oppose regulation of coal emissions. Citing the huge increase in shale gas which has transformed the American energy market in recent years, they want gas to become the centrepiece of Britain's energy future.</p> <p>But the argument made is false. In the US it is true that shale gas has slashed energy prices, forcing the closure of many coal-fired power stations and thereby reducing US emissions. But as Chatham House and others have pointed out, the UK and Europe do not have accessible shale gas in anything like the same volume, it will be some years before it can be commercially exploited and it is unlikely to be cheap. It was striking that the CBI director general, John Cridland, immediately repudiated Davey's announcement, warning that excessive reliance on gas would leave the UK exposed to dangerous global price and supply fluctuations.</p> <p>The Conservative right complains of the cost to consumers of green policies. But the Climate Change Committee has shown that such policies have contributed only one-sixth of the price rises consumers have experienced over the past decade. Almost all the rest has come from the rising cost of gas. It is precisely this that has caused the energy giants to increase their prices again this week.</p> <p>As the government's own analysis shows, there are no cheap energy futures, whatever technologies are chosen. The huge advantage of renewables is that, once built, the fuel is free, and home-grown. The answer to rising prices is therefore not to abandon the low-carbon agenda, but to reinforce it through higher energy efficiency.</p> <p>So will the energy bill confirm that Osborne and the Tory right have won and Britain is now dashing for gas? The whisper in Whitehall is that a compromise may be reached, in which Davey gets a \"decarbonisation\" target for 2030, while Osborne imposes a cap on renewable subsidies.</p> <p>But this would not be a compromise at all. For investors, an aspirational target almost two decades hence is worth little \u2013 you can't bank money on it. What matters is the regime in place for investment now, and if the subsidies are capped, that will inevitably mean (with nuclear protected) that renewables are displaced by gas.</p> <p>This is a real test both for the Liberal Democrats and for Cameron, whose famous promise that the coalition would be \"the greenest government ever\" is on the line.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Jacobs is visiting professor in the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics</p>",
  "<h2>Berina Uruci at Barclays Capital</h2> <p>We now have data for the whole of the third quarter and these suggest sales volumes grew by 1% quarter-on-quarter compared with zero growth during the previous quarter. This is a marked improvement from the low growth seen over the past two years and suggests that after experiencing tough trading conditions for a prolonged period of time, retailing conditions could be improving now. Although not all headwinds facing the sector have disappeared, with consumer confidence and household income growth likely to remain well below historical levels, we expect the sector to stabilise in the coming months. More generally, we expect private consumption to be broadly flat for the second half of this year before it starts a measured recovery from the beginning of next year.</p> <h2>Philip Rush, UK economist at Nomura</h2> <p>The stability of sales in recent months has been pleasantly surprising against the backdrop of disruption from the diamond jubilee and Olympics. Unsettled weather conditions earlier in the year had delivered much more volatility. Through it all though, the trend rate of growth has remained brisk and the September performance perpetuated that strength. The only thing that has really changed in 2012 to explain this improvement is the alleviation of inflation pressure on the high street.</p> <p>Value growth has been remarkably stable since the Great Recession, only it was previously all being funnelled into paying higher prices. Consumers were essentially running just to stand still. Extra signs of strength in the durable items are particularly encouraging as it shows greater willingness of consumers to spend on high-ticket items. The income and confidence that comes with having a job (employment is now at its highest ever level) is a wonderful motivator.</p> <h2>Samuel Tombs, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>September's rise in the official measure of retail sales volumes suggested that consumers have loosened their purse strings a little. However, the rise partly reflected temporary sources of support. Furthermore, the outlook for spending has darkened over the past month.</p> <p>However, some of this growth seems to have reflected temporary factors, not least a recovery from the Olympics-related drop in spending in August. The autumnal weather and delayed back-to-school spending probably also accounted for some of the 2% monthly rise in clothing sales volumes.</p> <p>What's more, the outlook for spending in the run-up to Christmas does not look particularly encouraging. The recently announced utility price hikes look set to add renewed pressure on household incomes. And the latest labour market indicators suggested that the strong growth in employment is likely to come to an end soon. Meanwhile, the low level of consumer confidence continues to point on the basis of past form to renewed falls in retail sales volumes. So a sustained recovery in retail spending still seems unlikely to get under way soon.</p> <h2>Alan Clarke, fixed income strategy at Global Banking and Markets, Scotiabank</h2> <p>The headwinds from inflation that were squeezing household real disposable income have now abated. These data suggest that consumers have been prepared to spend that \"windfall\". The second half of the year promises to be much better than the first half.</p> <h2>Shehan Mohamed, senior economist, Centre for Economics and Business Research</h2> <p>Robust increases in retail sales in the past few months suggests consumer spending growth could be positive in the third quarter. However, continued business uncertainty is likely to dampen investment growth while government spending could be negative drag. We therefore could expect mildly positive growth in the third quarter in our central case scenario.</p> <p>Whilst the labour market appears to be picking up, pay growth is expected to be flat in real terms for the remainder of this year. The cost of housing is increasing at a high pace compared with income growth \u2013 private rents are up 3.2% year-on-year in September while house prices are up 1.8% in the year to August based on the ONS House Price Index measure. As such, expect discretionary retail purchases to be shelved as consumers continue to seek value in tough economic conditions.</p> <h2>Malcolm Barr, UK economist at JP Morgan</h2> <p>The usual health warning that the UK retail sales data are often a poor guide to overall spending trends applies. But the establishment of a decent uptrend in retail sales sits alongside national accounts estimates for household consumption which have shown stabilisation since late last year, confidence and mortgage approvals numbers that are weak in level terms but are broadly stable, and an uptrend in the level of private car registrations.</p> <p>Lurking in the background is that the drag on real income growth from high rates of inflation is fading, even though that process is set to a knock in the coming handful of months thanks to increases in domestic energy bills. Whether the fading of drags on household income will help generate enough spending growth to drive a recovery worthy of the name remains in significant doubt. But the broadening signs of a return to growth in household spending is mildly encouraging at this stage.</p>",

  "<p>A good set of results sent Jupiter higher, up 3.8% to 274p. The fund manager saw net inflows of \u00a3600m in the third quarter, as clients opted for its more cautious fund range in the uncertain global economic climate.</p> <p>Inflows to the mutual funds business totalled \u00a3795m but the total was held back by the loss of one mandate and the withdrawal of the remainder of a large private client portfolio. Overall assets under management rose to a whopping \u00a325bn in the three months to September.</p> <p>The company said:</p> <blockquote> While mutual funds flows have improved, we remain cautious looking forward given fragile consumer confidence and industry flows remaining vulnerable to any increase in stock market volatility. </blockquote> <p>David McCann at Numis has a buy rating on the stock, with a price target of 320p. He said the inflows into Jupiter's mutual funds was driven by an improvement in flows from European investors and \"encouragingly\" also from UK investors. He writes:</p> <blockquote> Jupiter's short term economics in absolute terms will be constrained by market levels and sentiment. We concede it is therefore hard to build a strong short term investment case, given that earnings growth is likely to be modest and could easily go backwards under weakening conditions. You are however paid reasonably well to wait, with a c.3% yield and we believe there is scope to significantly uplift the dividend, possibly by as much as 100% in the next 2.5 years, as the balance sheet continues to improve to a level, beyond which the group will need to retain a far lower proportion of earnings. </blockquote>",

  "<p>Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/10/ultimate-climate-change-faq\">climate change</a> is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/15/climate-change-rainfall\"> expected to lead to slightly more rainfall at the global level</a>, the timing and distribution of that rain is likely to change, increasing the chance of drought in some regions. The details are very difficult to predict, however. This is partly because regional climate impacts are strongly dependent on large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns like the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpsRQtk6IfM\">jet stream</a>, which are hard to model in climate simulations. There is some indication from&#xa0;climate modelling&#xa0;that the Mediterranean, central America and Western Australia regions may experience reduced precipitation, but there is still considerable uncertainty as climate models do not all agree, because local features such as mountains and rainforests can be important, and because of the large range of natural variability.</p> <p>The picture is made even more complex by the fact that unusually low levels of rainfall (so-called meteorological drought) isn't the only factor affecting the existence or significance of drought conditions. Just as important is hydrological drought, in which the water supplies in groundwater or reservoirs are depleted. There are also \"agricultural drought\" and \"economic drought\" which result from the inability to access water when needed rather than from the lack of water itself, and in some regions these are more important than the physical factors.</p> <p>The various types of drought are closely related, of course, and different countries have different levels of sensitivity to each. Meteorological drought was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/10/england-driest-may-drought\">experienced by&#xa0;southern parts of the UK in 2011</a>, leading to hydrological drought as the water in storage systems became low. When the rainfall increased again in&#xa0;spring 2012, hydrological drought conditions (and the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/13/hosepipe-ban-uk-water-companies\">hosepipe ban</a>) remained in place until the stores started to be recharged. In that case the effect on the population was limited, but in places like India, where the year's rainfall is concentrated in the&#xa0;monsoon&#xa0;season, small changes in the location or timing of precipitation can have a big regional impact on agriculture.</p> <p>Like other types of extreme weather, drought is experienced when circulation patterns get 'stuck' in one formation, or push outside their normal bounds of variation. In 2003, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/aug/21/france.weather\">heatwave and drought in Europe</a> was caused by just such a blocked circulation pattern and may have caused&#xa0;tens of thousands&#xa0;of excess deaths. As temperatures remained high for a long time, the soil moisture evaporated, causing an additional&#xa0;feedback&#xa0;and worsening the heatwave. Calculations indicate that this kind of event may have&#xa0;doubled in frequency&#xa0;due to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and could continue to become more frequent and more severe. Therefore, if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, then by the end of this century European summers like 2003 could be \"anomalously cold\".</p> <p>The exact position and timing of monsoons are influenced by many factors and would vary from year to year even in the absence of global warming. Climate change is&#xa0;expected&#xa0;to cause a weakening of the circulation pattern, but an increase in atmospheric water content. Some areas are predicted to experience more drought, others less, but the competing effects make it harder to detect and predict changes, so uncertainty in these projections is large.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was written by Erica Thompson, Juan Duan and Brian Hoskins of the <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/climatechange\">Grantham Institute for Climate Change</a>, <a href=\"http://imperial.ac.uk/\">Imperial College London</a>, in collaboration with the Guardian</em></p> <h2>The ultimate climate change FAQ</h2> <p>\u2022 This answer last updated: 10.10.2012<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/05/ultimate-climate-change-faq\">Read about the project and suggest a question</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/09/climate-faq-report-error\">Report an error in this answer</a></p> <p><strong>Related questions</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/15/climate-change-rainfall\">How will climate change affect rainfall?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/08/climate-change-more-floods\">Will climate change lead to more flooding?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/28/water-vapour-greenhouse-gas\">If water vapour is the key greenhouse gas, why are man-made emissions important?</a></p> <h2>This editorial is free to reproduce under Creative Commons</h2> <p><br>This post by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">The Guardian</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/uk/\">Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License</a>.<br>Based on a work at <a xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" rel=\"dc:source\">theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Last month Lord Ashcroft <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9547999/Lord-Ashcroft-tells-Coalition-to-turn-off-the-golden-taps-and-stop-flooding-the-developing-world-with-our-money.html\" title=\"\">articulated a challenge to the UK's foreign aid strategy</a>, its ring-fenced development budget and its growth. He hinted at some of the vested interests that have naturally developed after so long and doing things the same way. This is a sign of the success of campaigns for more money to solve international development problems. More money is a good thing, perhaps most useful when it is about investing in opportunities.</p> <p>The voices about doing things differently carry less weight. Citing <a href=\"http://www.radicalcapital.eu/blog/8/Exporting-the-UK-s-social-investment-leadership\" title=\"\">Radical Capital's blog</a>, is this where more of the money could go?</p> <p>Ring-fencing and protecting any area of public spending is almost guaranteed in the longer term to freeze out the benefits of changes happening in other areas of public policy, because the walls of silos become opaque and solid. The voice of existing service providers can overcome the voice of innovators after an initial flurry of creativity and prospecting. Far be it from me to suggest that one hand of government policy is detached from another.</p> <p>There is, however, an interesting lack of connectivity between the government's commitment to maintain the development budget and the breakthrough thinking and market shaping it is achieving elsewhere. The silo of international development maybe blocking out opportunities for breakthrough positive stories while at the same time allowing vested interested linked to entrenched problems to become too influential. This is reducing accountability, reducing the value of transparency and undermining the conditions for innovation and sustainable change.</p> <p>The irony of this is that, although the UK can claim to be world leader in the area of social investment strategy and market making, we do not have a monopoly on some of the most inspirational social innovations. Many breakthrough ideas, products and approaches are rooted in the 'majority world' where the development budget is spent. We can be blinded by labelling the 'developing world' and so rarely expect to find such raw talent. This isn't a surprise to people interested in entrepreneurship, because a developing economy, and even post-conflict zones, are fertile conditions for innovation.</p> <p><a href=\"http://business-ethics.com/2011/12/01/1725-jp-morgan-social-%E2%80%98impact-investing%E2%80%99-presents-trillion-dollar-%E2%80%98opportunity%E2%80%99/\" title=\"\">Recent global research</a> shows the potential return from social impact investments is primarily located in developing economies of the majority world. So, why then is the UK's development budget not more influenced by the government's social investment strategy and why is a proportion of the budget not social investments, with a blended social, economic and environmental return?</p> <p>There could be many benefits of moving in this direction. In the same way that the UK respects entrepreneurs of all sorts at home, it would be investing in the same breed of talent abroad. If the government believes social business and SMEs are the domestic lifeblood, why not invest in that abroad? To stimulate a sustainable domestic social economy the government is backing institutions that create a virtuous cycle of funding.</p> <p>So why is the UK only supporting large charitable institutions abroad that are reliant on a cycle of funding need? A phrase I am using a lot this year it seems is that the funder gets the sector they deserve. Funding methods influence the shape of the sector and behaviours, even beliefs. Perhaps all future increases in the budget could be made available for social investment, rather than to fund business as usual. Might this also develop local agents to influence sustainable and effective local governance?</p> <p>Paraphrasing Chris Carr in a blog for <a href=\"http://www.radicalcapital.eu/\" title=\"\">Radical Capital</a>, the micro-finance sector has already shown that it is possible to create sustainable businesses in many parts of the majority world.</p> <p>A proportion of the budget could be invested to support social invention, innovation and social enterprises. If a return can be generated, then this could be re-cycled and in due course an increase in the aid budget each year could be self-generating. This requires a change in philosophy and the approach is already being used by government at home. Radical approaches to reforming the aid budget will undoubtedly trigger adverse reactions. Surely those agencies already working in the field are there to do themselves out of a job?</p> <p>Top down is a dubious way of stimulating fundamentally more sustainable development.

  "<p>\"Guys, the ice caps are melting now,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/11/im-with-the-bears-review\" title=\"\">wrote Chris Ross in the Guardian Review last year</a>. \"Where are those stories?\"</p> <p>The review's subject was a collection of short stories, I'm With the Bears, all on the issue of climate change. It featured good writing \u2013 from the likes of Margaret Atwood and Lydia Millet \u2013 but, as Ross put it, \"much of this material seems to have been lifted from the wastebasket.\" Why was no one writing fresh fiction about it?</p> <p>One year on, the question still stands. \"In spite of the stakes,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/30/50-months-climate-change\" title=\"\">said Andrew Simms on the Guardian's environment blog the other day</a>, \"the issue has receded from the political frontline like a wave shrinking down a beach.\" It seems that the wave never quite reached our beach \u2013 the beach of fiction writing \u2013 in the first place.</p> <p>Sure, there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780224090490/solar\" title=\"\">Solar</a>. Ian McEwan's 2010 satire of a balding, overweight scientist with marriage problems explicitly focused on \"the most pressing and complex problem of our time\". That's the one everyone could probably mention. But after that? There was mainly silence (if you leave aside poetry, where much more seems to be going on, most notably, perhaps, <a href=\"http://whatisadrift.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">Tom Chivers' ADRIFT project</a>).</p> <p>There's apocalyptic fiction, of course, and you could, I suppose, connect a novel such as Margaret Atwood's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781844085644/the-year-of-the-flood\" title=\"\">The Year of the Flood</a> to climate change. But is this type of literature really concerned with the issue, or does a vaguely related scenario merely serve as a purpose for other themes and situations? (Also, as environmentalists are increasingly keen to point out, climate change isn't really about the end of the world at all; it's about living conditions becoming harder and harder as we go along.)</p> <p>Yes, Jonathan Franzen's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780007318520/freedom\" title=\"\">Freedom</a> (2010) touched on the issue (the \"greener than Greenpeace\" Walter is deeply worried about it), and one could stretch things by considering books such as Joe Dunthorne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780241144060/wild-abandon\" title=\"\">Wild Abandon</a> (2011), which is interested in low-carbon living. A number of childrens' books are on-topic, too. In Saci Lloyd's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780340970157/the-carbon-diaries\" title=\"\">The Carbon Diaries 2015</a> (2008), for example, the UK has become the first nation to introduce carbon dioxide rationing. But the kids are alright, really: many are getting climate change much better than the grown-ups do (and, naturally, they're much more worried about it).</p> <p>No, it's we adults who are failing to have this conversation. It's an unpleasant conversation to have, no doubt about it \u2013 and maybe that's why it's not really taking place in fiction, at least not centre-stage. Many novels vaguely reference the situation; sentences such as \"in a warming world\" or \"in these times of climate change\" are common in much of what's being published at the moment. But that's about it.</p> <p>As such, the portrayal of climate change in fiction might actually be a pretty accurate reflection of what's going on in the real world. We know about it, and we know it's a pretty damn serious problem, but engage with it directly? Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the day after tomorrow. Isn't someone else looking into it? We don't want to have this conversation, it seems; and neither do most characters in most novels being published.</p> <p>It's probably also true that climate change is far too complex an issue to write a definitive novel about. But is it too complex an issue for fiction writers to make a contribution? To write not so much a definitive novel about it, but one of many complementary ones? My own attempt at this, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780957192508/from-here\" title=\"\">From Here</a> (2012), tells the story of a group of ordinary people (a supermarket cashier, an ex-banker, a hipster girl), who've come together in an unlikely alliance \u2013 realising how this one issue touches them all to the core. It's full of the contradictions surrounding climate change, and the confusion many people (even those actively involved) feel around it. Telling people that I was working on a story that tackles the issue head-on, and with a clear stance on it, the response I often got was: are you sure? Which, more than once, probably meant: are you completely out of your mind?</p> <p>There's a school of thought that says novels shouldn't (even can't) be about a very current issue. One could reply that climate change isn't very current in that sense \u2013 it didn't start yesterday, and it will be with us for a long, long time \u2013 but I won't, because our response to it (or lack thereof) is as current as it gets. But ought that really to prevent us from writing about it?</p> <p>Zadie Smith beautifully described the dangers of writing fiction that's grounded in the now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2012/sep/07/zadie-smith-james-meek-podcast\" title=\"\">in a recent Guardian podcast</a>. People tend to find their own time \"uninteresting, vulgar and stupid,\" she said, and they will constantly accuse you of \"shallowness, because there's a sense that literature must be timeless\". And yet, the novels that \"end up being important to people are the ones which in some way express their time\" \u2013 provided you're not simply producing a \"springboard to talk about whatever is in the news.\"</p> <p>It's definitely a fine line, but we need to have this conversation, and I refuse to accept that I'm the only one who believes that fiction can make a massive contribution to it. Novels are about human beings, and it's one of their great strengths that they can be as open and honest as they wish \u2013 about our errors and failures, about our confusions, but also about our deepest wishes and hopes. That's why they have the power to cut through many of the things that make our coming-to-terms with climate change so hard on a strictly factual level.</p> <p>What is our fiction, if it's shying away from \"the most pressing and complex problem of our time\"? What is our fiction, if all we really strive for is to make some universal statement on humankind, avoiding the messiness that's the here and now? What is our fiction if, wanting to be timeless, we forget our own times? So, I'm putting this as a question, but also as a provocation: Where are those stories?</p>",

  "<p>Simon Hoggart is one of my oldest friends, so I try not to say \"Simon is right\" more than is strictly necessary. But he's 100% right in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/17/andrew-mitchell\" title=\"\">his parliamentary sketch today</a> when he likens Ed Miliband's assault on the Tory chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, to bear-baiting, which was made illegal in this country in 1835.</p> <p>It's a month since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-police-row-move-along\" title=\"\">I last protested that Mitchell had behaved badly</a> in abusing an obstructive police officer who had refused to open Downing Street's security gates for the great man's bike. But I also argued that he'd apologised and it was now time to move on.</p> <p>It was obvious even then that the police are in an industrial dispute with the government and were politicising the incident for partisan advantage. So were Labour MPs \u2013 it's their job, up to a point \u2013 Tory newspapers who think Mitchell a bit snooty and too free with the taxpayers' aid money, and some Conservative MPs who don't like him either.</p> <p>All that has since become even more evident. The West Mercia chapter of the Police Federation had a session with Mitchell \u2013 he's a Birmingham MP \u2013 which didn't go very well. Afterwards its spokesman demanded his resignation from the government. Who do these people think they are? It's not as if the West Midlands force is covered in glory. It's crime clean-up rate is down, according to a local website, and it was compromised in the Hillsborough cover-up.</p> <p>As for the press, well they like to have their cake and gobble it too. Today's Daily Mail \u2013 my touchstone in these matters \u2013 complains about the cops Tasering a blind man (his white stick apparently looked like a Samurai sword) all over page one, but on the inside pages it's Mitchell-baiting as usual.</p> <p>At a meeting of the backbench 1922 committee of Tory MPs last night more colleagues spoke in his defence than were critical. One of the critics, the MP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Duddridge\" title=\"\">James Duddridge</a>, who has risen and fallen without much trace, is reported as urging Mitchell to fall on his sword. But he was sacked as a whip last month so that's hardly rocket science.</p> <p>David Cameron is hanging on to his chief whip, though not without cost. Bad headlines are not what he needs and yesterday's bear-baiting at PMQs took the shine off the better employment figures, which we should welcome even if we don't rate the government's austerity strategy (and we don't, do we?). My hunch is that he'll survive.</p> <p>But Labour's strategy is to use the affair to reinforce the notion that posh boys like Cameron, George Osborne and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Mitchell\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> \u2013 a well-off scion of Rugby School and Cambridge \u2013 don't understand real life and are typical of the coalition's overprivileged cabinet. Someone made that point to me on Twitter during PMQs.</p> <p>That makes sense as political tactics (if not overdone, Ed), but it prompts me to ask if it is actually true. \"Less than half the cabinet are very privileged,\" I told my friend on Twitter. Actually that's an exaggeration, as a quick canter through their Wiki CVs will confirm.</p> <p>Briefly Cameron, Nick Clegg and chancellor Osborne are famously children of upper middle-class metropolitan privilege. Broadly speaking so are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt_(politician)\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a> (health) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Paterson\" title=\"\">Owen Paterson</a> (environment), in the sense that they went to well-known public schools and Oxbridge. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Galbraith,_2nd_Baron_Strathclyde\" title=\"\">Lord Strathclyde</a> is quite posh too, like Mitchell <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tam_Galbraith\" title=\"\">the son of a Tory MP</a> who (as it happens) was unfairly hounded by the tabloids in the Vassall spy affair.</p> <p>More than half the cabinet went to Oxford or Cambridge, but as with Labour or the Thatcher/Major era Tories, that usually reflects academic vigour rather than privilege. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May\" title=\"\">Theresa May</a> is a clergyman's daughter whose grammar school became a comp.

Ken Clarke's dad was a watchmaker whose clever son went to Nottingham High \u2013 like Ed Balls \u2013 and on to Cambridge to become a lawyer. Greening went to Southampton University and became an accountant. And so on.</p> <p>Vince Cable is a clever working-class boy from York. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Alexander#Early_life_and_education\" title=\"\">Danny Alexander</a> attended state schools in the Highlands, then Oxford.

But it's not posh or privileged and to say so is as daft as the Tory papers trying to prove (as they do) that Ed Miliband's own background \u2013 the son of refugees who attended a north London comp \u2013 is posh or privileged.

  "<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.victoriansociety.org.uk/\">Victorian Society</a> publishes its list of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/oct/18/victorian-society-threatened-buildings\">top 10 most endangered Victorian and Edwardian buildings</a>, it might be sobering to look at a scheme that will destroy, according to <a href=\"http://www.savebritainsheritage.org/\">Save Britain's Heritage</a>, \"the grandest parade of market buildings in Europe\".</p> <p>The latest plans for London's <a href=\"http://www.forever-changes.com/smithfields%20market/general%20market/general%20market.htm\">Smithfield General Market</a>, unveiled this week by <a href=\"http://www.henderson.com/sites/henderson/home.aspx\">Henderson Global Investors</a>, follow a long and chequered history of brutal attempts to flatten the historic complex.</p> <p>Built between 1866 and 1883 by <a href=\"http://www.thetowerbridge.info/sir-horace-jones\">Horace Jones</a>, architect of the other City markets and <a href=\"http://www.towerbridge.org.uk/TBE/EN/\">Tower Bridge</a>, the ornate halls formalised an activity that had been carried out on the site for over a thousand years. The famous <a href=\"http://www.smithfieldmarket.com/\">Meat Market</a> is still functioning and is safe for the time being, but the collection of buildings to the west have lain derelict for some time.</p> <p>The General Market, Fish Market, and what's known as the Red House make up about a quarter of the whole complex, and it is these that have been threatened with demolition and replacement by big floorplate commercial blocks \u2013 actively encouraged by the City's thirst for yet more office space, despite the current glut.</p> <p>A muscular glass and steel megalith by <a href=\"http://www.kpf.com/\">KPF</a> was thankfully <a href=\"http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/blears-stops-kpf%E2%80%99s-smithfield-general-market-redevelopment/3120121.article\">thrown out in 2008</a> by the then communities secretary, Hazel Blears, after a four-year battle. Developer Thornfield then appointed <a href=\"http://www.mcaslan.co.uk/\">John McAslan</a>, whose practice has a strong track record of sensitive interventions in historic environments, but again plans were scuppered when the client went into administration.</p> <p>The site was subsequently acquired by Henderson, which has retained McAslan and come back with a proposal that will apparently \"preserve the historic identity of the market buildings through the retention, restoration and reuse of the most significant parts of the historic buildings\".</p> <p>Their scheme includes a two-part piazza within the General Market building, arranged to provide \"much needed vibrant and visually attractive activity\" to the neighbouring streets. The developer also trumpets the \"sensitive inclusion\" of new \"low-rise pavilions\" of office space \u2013 which in fact rise to a height of 20m.</p> <p>The use of the term \"pavilions\" for substantial buildings has become a common planning application trope, used by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/richard-rogers\">Richard Rogers</a>' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/jan/23/one-hyde-park-candy-brothers\">One Hyde Park</a> development, where vast residential towers attempt to dissemble their bulk behind this ludicrous moniker. It makes little more sense here, where three boxy blocks will tower above the huddled roofline of the market below.</p> <p>\"It's another scoop-out job,\" says Clem Cecil of Save Britain's Heritage, referring to the common strategy of retaining the facade of an existing building and mining out everything behind. A similar scoop-out was recently granted for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19896394\">Spitalfields' Fruit and Wool Exchange</a>, passed by Boris Johnson against the advice of the local authority and conservation groups.</p> <p>At Smithfield, not only is it scooping out, it is also knee-capping the existing buildings: the entire ground floor will be replaced with glass, front and back, leaving the first floor floating in a strange parody: \"a token nod towards conservation\", says Cecil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397954668\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350501679903/Smithfield2.jpg\" alt=\"Interior of proposed Smithfield market\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ground-floor view of the proposal which 'plays fast and loose with the building's historic elements and fittings'</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henderson Global Investors</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Images of the proposal suggest a more sensitive approach than what has come before, but Save argues these \"beguiling\" scenes \"play fast and loose with the building's historic elements and fittings\".</p> <p>\"It's all very pretty, but it's just throwing sparkly dust in our eyes,\" says Cecil. \"Look closely and it's just hashed-together conservation detailing.\"</p> <p>Save is currently working up an alternative proposal with <a href=\"http://www.bff-architects.co.uk/\">Burrell Foley Fischer</a> architects which, they claim, demonstrates a financially viable alternative to demolition, utilising the warren of tunnels and storerooms beneath the market for new retail space.</p> <p>With a dreary abundance of vacant office buildings already marching down Farringdon Road, the logic of adding yet more must be questioned \u2013 even with the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/crossrail\">Crossrail</a> at Farringdon. Smithfield is a unique part of the city, one of those curious corners of old London that could surely be colonised with stalls and street life in the same way that <a href=\"http://www.boroughmarket.org.uk/\">Borough Market</a> or <a href=\"http://www.coventgardenlondonuk.com/markets/page/1\">Covent Garden</a> have been. While McAslan's scheme is an improvement on previous proposals, it does not go far enough: it will leave only a flimsy skin of heritage, a picturesque skirt of Victoriana around the base of yet another slab of generic commercial development.</p>",
  "<p>Aid is a huge global industry whose success is not at all obvious. Despite some gains, poverty has not been eradicated, climate change has not been halted and rights have not been respected. Yet poor outcomes are blamed on technical glitches, and fundamental deficiencies in aid policy remain unexamined. Palestine is an important illustration of this, owing to the high level of aid dependence, the many international donors involved and the millions of Palestinians who have suffered for decades despite billions of dollars being spent.</p> <p>I've been disillusioned with aid-funded development in Palestine since I arrived in 2004 and found local NGOs chasing international funding by modifying their programmes, publishing information in English rather than in Arabic, and hiring extra staff to submit financial reports in foreign currencies. In response, I helped found the Dalia Association, a Palestinian NGO that promotes self-determination through local control over resources. Dalia's articles <a href=\"http://www.dalia.ps/node/123\" title=\"\">\"Does the international aid system violate Palestinian rights?\"</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dalia.ps/node/179\" title=\"\">\"Don't forget your duty to do no harm in Gaza\"</a> framed aid in Palestine as a right and linked aid advocacy to the Palestinian national movement as well as to the <a href=\"http://betteraid.org/\" title=\"\">global aid reform movement</a>.</p> <p>Dalia published a study of grassroots civil society priorities for aid reform, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GGoVjRvAnw&amp;feature=player_embedded\" title=\"\">distributed a short film</a>, and launched an international petition to broaden awareness. Locals were enthusiastic, but internationals didn't respond. Perhaps they thought their good intentions freed them from responsibility for the collective impact of aid on Palestinians.</p> <p>I still hoped we could influence aid policy if we held donors accountable for putting into practice the principles they espouse \u2013 such as local ownership, mutual accountability, and harmonisation with local agendas. I engaged with the formal processes, even taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/fourth-high-level-forum-on-aid-effectiveness\" title=\"\">high-level forum on aid effectiveness</a> and promoting the <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/international%20dialogue/anewdealforengagementinfragilestates.htm\" title=\"\">new deal for effective engagement in fragile states</a>. But I become disillusioned. A huge swath of global civil society now appears to be co-opted into a formal process of \"aid reform\" that has a diluted vision, wastes precious resources and often can't practise what it preaches \u2013 all because society groups work within the unacceptably narrow constraints prescribed by donors.</p> <p>So, we shifted focus to Palestinians' own policies. We asked: \"If Palestinians want international aid on their own terms, what are those terms?\" Participants complained: \"Why do donors fund our schools and do nothing when Israel bombs them? Why do donors punish Palestinians for pursuing their legal rights through the UN?\"</p> <p>We know the main obstacle to development is the occupation, colonisation and dispossession of the Palestinian people. The only means to achieve real development, therefore, is a just political settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What emerged was that these Palestinians at least don't want \"aid\" at all. They want political intervention and the financial support they are entitled to in order to pursue their own development. Moreover, they advocated rejection of false development projects that are, at best, distractions, and at worst, harmful to Palestinian dignity, independence and sustainability.</p> <p>Although some kinds of aid are helpful, the system as a whole is closed and self-serving. Because of that, we can't change aid policy through civil society participation. International actors know exactly what they are doing in Palestine: they are perpetuating an unequal but controllable status quo, and they don't want to change. And we can't make them.</p> <p>Maybe we can't change donors' aid policies, but Palestinians can stop participating in their own oppression by refusing aid offered on detrimental terms. Through <a href=\"http://www.bdsmovement.net/\" title=\"\">boycott, divestment and sanctions</a> (BDS), Palestinians and their supporters refuse to do business with people or entities that undermine the prospects for a just peace. Should BDS expand to target aid? I think it should. By focusing on what they can control \u2013 their own policy about what aid they will accept or reject \u2013 Palestinians can take control of their development.</p> <p>The challenge is formidable. There will be political pressure, millions may become even poorer, and the elite may fight efforts to change a system they profit from. But Palestinians may not be as dependent on international aid as they think. If we take a \u20ac10m project and deduct the unnecessary expenditure \u2013 the amount taken by donors and international NGOs for administration, that wasted on non-local priorities, and that spent on overpriced foreign consultants and supplies from Europe \u2013 the remaining balance might be not be so great.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"http://www.noralestermurad.com/2012/08/29/are-there-alternatives-to-dependence-on-international-aid-yes/\" title=\"\">there are alternatives to dependence on aid</a>. And with the help of the Palestinian diaspora and supporters worldwide, Palestinians can develop new models of sustainability that do not require them to mortgage their future to international actors whose vision for Palestine is unacceptable.</p> <p>These are hard times to propose taking risks, but perhaps we've reached these hard times by playing it safe for too long.</p>",
  "<p>Many economic policy experts believe that the UK is half way through the painful downturn and will only return to sustained growth by 2017. But what kind of competencies will voluntary sector leaders need to thrive between now and then?</p> <p>It is a strange, difficult and exciting time to be leading a voluntary sector organisation. On the one hand, austerity can create a 'perfect storm', with charitable donations decreasing at a time when service demands are increasing as many families and households struggle and need more support. Yet on the other, Localsim Act and 'big society' appear to be creating opportunities for new types of voluntary sector\u2013led interventions, notably through the mutualisation of services traditionally provided by local government, ranging from social care to green spaces.</p> <p>At present, we face a new and difficult environment, and fresh challenges. Leaders need to reflect on what skills they and their management teams need.</p> <p>If in 2007 you were to tell someone that just five years later we would live in a world where banks are nationalised (to bail out a failed financial system) and local government was privatised (in terms of outsourcing as part of a shift to a commissioning role during a period of public spending cuts), at best you would have been laughed at.</p> <p>A fast changing, complex world is not new. But such volatility means a voluntary sector leader is challenged to ensure their organisation, community or network is resilient to such changes. That is, having the capability to understand the complex systems you live in and to make smart interventions accordingly. So when shocks occur \u2013 be they a food price hike, overhaul of the benefits system, or migration shifts as a result of the Eurozone crisis \u2013 you are able to bounce back, learn and transform.</p> <p>This means any organisational development strategy of value should now factor in the need for a new set of skills and management frameworks. Voluntary sector organisations must be led by people who thrive in such complex systems; people who are adept at overcoming silos (through charm and challenge), to work across disciplines and sectors to create shared value. This requires a leader who is equally comfortable with strategising or stakeholder engagement as with a balance sheet or a scientific journal.</p> <p>It entails ensuring that key leverage points in their organisation's complex system \u2013 across a host of services, departments, or disciplines \u2013 are fully utilised in support of its strategy. This holds true irrespective of size.</p> <p>By doing so, for 2017 and beyond, we will have more resilient voluntary sector leaders.

  "<h2>Colin Cram, consultant specialising in public sector procurement and a former director of the <a href=\"http://www.nwcope.org.uk/\" title=\"\">North West Centre of Excellence</a></h2> <p><strong>Procurement is a prisoner </strong>to how the public sector is organised, ie, its organisation is internally facing. It needs to be organised in a way that enables it to deal most effectively with the private sector. In areas where it is essential to get it right for quality as well as price, such as NHS drugs procurement, there is a central team doing it on behalf of the whole devolved NHS structure. The same principles should apply to other procurements. The procurements may be diverse, but for major projects many of the skills required are the same.</p> <p><strong>Service level agreements </strong>would ensure that internal public sector customers got what they wanted. Fortunately for it, public sector procurement has no external competitors. The status quo is, therefore, preferable for those who work in it. As things stand, there will never be enough specialist expertise to go round the several thousand public sector procurement organisations. Therefore, things will go obviously wrong. Who would know if one is paying far too much for a contract? Staff reductions of up to 30% can still result in a much better procurement service? Who would want that? Certainly not many procurement people.</p> <p><strong>The EU procurement directives </strong>are used as an excuse,<strong> </strong>but they have not caused problems in securing value for money through best practice, such as working up and down supply chains to take out unnecessary cost and risk. It is worth noting that, without the EU directives, Virgin is unlikely to have had a successful appeal. The directives have forced improved procurement standards in many parts of the UK public sector. The more capable and savvy procurement directors have used them effectively as an argument to get increased staff resources and investment in systems and training.</p> <p><strong>Coherent might be a better word </strong>than centralisation. We need a coherent organisation that is based on central, regional local structure, ensuring markets and suppliers are properly managed and specialist and commodity expertise is available to all. It would also provide procurement people with a great career structure and probably a much better structure for training them. Imagine the depth of outsourcing expertise that such an organisation could possess. Many suppliers find the lack of experience and specialist expertise in the organisations with which they are dealing to be extremely frustrating and costly. Others simply take advantage of it.</p> <h2>Stephanie Elsy, managing director of a business delivering efficiency in public services. Previously senior director of <a href=\"http://www.serco.com/\" title=\"\">Serco Group</a></h2> <p><strong>Social value depends </strong>on the determination of the commissioner to get it from the provider:<strong> </strong>they must include social outcomes in the selection criteria. If it is not explict, it won't happen because the bidders will not cost it in. This can be done and is being done. One of my favourite examples is the original contract that <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">TfL</a> had with Serco for the <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modalpages/2632.aspx\" title=\"\">Docklands Light Railway</a> - there were explicit requirements around local community engagement and employment practises.</p> <p><strong>Government procurement </strong>is done under appalling public scrutiny; the private sector does not have to cope with this and can, unless it is of a fatal magnitude, hide its mistakes. There needs to be a centralised, mandatory procurement function, but I think it should be under Treasury or Cabinet Office control, not separate from government. This is what most large businesses do \u2013 and it works for the most part.</p> <p><strong>The media picture </strong>of the <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Department for Transport </a>could be an incomplete, distorted picture. All I would say is that people make mistakes and, for a disaster to happen, it usually takes quite a few people to make mistakes or not do what they are supposed to do. As my history teacher used to say, the one thing we learn from history is that people never learn from history. Pay may be an issue in retaining experienced people, but I suspect other factors, such as lack of resources, organisational turmoil with cuts and poor systems, could also have played a part \u2013 but this is speculation.</p> <h2>Paul Kennedy, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.cel.co.uk/home\" title=\"\">CEL Group</a>, which provides procurement and business services to public bodies</h2> <p><strong>Data and technology </strong>have a huge role to play in the areas of commoditised procurement. The standardisation and availability of the data, to support meaningful analysis remain the problem. A recent report on behalf of the Government in the Republic of Ireland showed that, out of a total spend of \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.3bn) on goods and services, \u20ac6.9bn was classed as \"addressable by procurement\". Some \u20ac4.3bn was thought to be addressable centrally, \u20ac2.1bn to be sector specific and, interestingly \u20ac0.5bn remained unclassified because of the poor quality of data.</p> <h2>Su Maddock, senior fellow at the <a href=\"https://research.mbs.ac.uk/innovation/\" title=\"\">Manchester Institute for Innovation Research</a> </h2> <p><strong>Procurement is being used </strong>as a panacea for achieving often conflicting objectives. For instance, the Department for Work and Pensions expected work programme procurement to deliver service innovation, efficiency savings and to transfer risk from the taxpayer to the private sector all through a neat two-tier model. Now even prime contractors are challenging the assumptions made and say they cannot afford the development costs of social innovation. There is a need for much more openness about commissioners (political) expectations and analysis of whether the business and procurement models adopted can deliver expectations.</p> <p><strong>Procurement officials </strong>are constrained by broader frameworks. All small organisations find public processes difficult. If commissioners prioritise \"transferring risk\" that cuts out even medium-sized companies. It seems to me that adding on social values clauses is not going to overcome these structural problems. Within the civil service and the wider public sector there has grown up a set of assumptions around what business models lead to efficiencies and that these not challenged enough \u2013 all models having a gearing, and it is frequently towards rationalisation rather than supporting the relationships that are shown to support holistic services. Rather than searching for the most effective national procurement services, I think locality commissioners are more likely to procure from who have a track record in inter-agency.</p> <p><strong>Richard Branson did us a favour </strong>by challenging the Department for Transport. Whatever you think of Virgin, he did reveal to the public that government procurement decisions are quite often based on delusional claims to win contracts. I think it is a problem in a democracy that policies are fought over but that transactional processes are assumed to be neutral, when they're not.</p> <h2>Adrian Quayle, managing director of P&amp;Q Consulting, and a board member of the <a href=\"http://www.noa.co.uk/\" title=\"\">National Outsourcing Association</a> </h2> <p><strong>Time is crucial. </strong>Those that work well have properly considered what they are trying to achieve, such as outcomes and benefits. They haven't just jumped straight into procurement on a cost and risk basis. The existence of this strategy and feasibility stage is essential and needn't take long but is often omitted in the rush to get into evaluation and contractual discussions. It's absence then impedes the process as much of the thinking, then has to be \"retro-fitted\" into the selection and contractual process. This is even more difficult to do in formal <a href=\"http://www.ojeu.eu/WhatIsTheOJEU.aspx\" title=\"\">OJEU</a>-based public procurement.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><a href=\"http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/Assessment-and-Certification-services/Management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BS-11000-Collaborative-Relationship-Management-Systems/\" title=\"\"><strong>British Standard on Collaborative Business Relationships</strong></a><strong> </strong>is gaining traction. The challenges of large and complex collaborative relationships were among the triggers for its development. The two parts of the standard set out good industry practices across the whole of the lifecycle (including procurement). The standard is beginning to get significant traction in a wide range of organisations across the private and public sectors \u2013 more than 25 have now certified against it.</p> <p><strong>Mentoring is necessary.</strong> In the private sector over recent years, much work has been carried out in establishing highly professional supplier relationship management (SRM) functions and teams. The skills they have increasingly focused on have been the softer aspects of culture and behaviours as part of broader performance management. The involvement of these teams in the procurement process is now recognised as essential. A significant number of these SRMs have been through the university accredited National Outsourcing Association <a href=\"http://www.noa.co.uk/index.php/site/pathway/\" title=\"\">pathway programme</a>. An extension of this into the public sector will provide capabilities and the alumni are already acting as a very effective support structure. We've also seen significant development in coaching and developing through the rise of mentoring organisations operating in this area.</p> <h2>Nigel Clifford, chief executive of the e-commerce network <a href=\"http://www.procserve.com/\" title=\"\">Procserve</a></h2> <p><strong>The challenge </strong>is sometimes making the intangible tangible. I was lucky enough to be in the NHS for six years (I mean that). It was the most complex but satisfying buying and supplying environment I have worked in \u2013 needing very deep thought on priorities and justifications that can be defended against a price-cost benchmark. A happy ward environment or a good patient experience needed a strong multifunctional buying team to define what lay beneath the outcome and how to communicate it quantitatively.</p> <p><strong>Sharing best practice </strong>is essential, both through sharing personnel as on secondment, using <a href=\"http://www.cips.org/aboutcips/mycips/\" title=\"\">Charted Institute of Purchasing and Supply</a> tools and resources and using the contracts and systems that are available. However, it is important that this is inclusive and builds the talent pool rather than alienating the public servants who are the constant in the procurement function. We need champions to whom ambitious twentysomethings can aspire to be in the future. Is procurement sexy enough and seen as a great and meaningful career? Personally I think it is and should be.</p> <h2>Tim Heywood, specialist public procurement and commercial lawyer </h2> <p><strong>The </strong><a href=\"http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Government Procurement Service</strong></a><strong> and civil servants </strong>handling commercial contracting are not well-supported. They handle what are often highly complex, high-profile matters and they have to do it with very modest resourcing. Their specialism is not fully recognised or valued in Whitehall, although this is improving, but those who do choose to specialise in procurement in the civil service are generally very capable and industrious.</p> <p><strong>There is a short term resourcing and capabilities issue </strong>about how to increase the overall levels of commercial awareness, negotiating skills and nous in the civil service. Training and development are certainly part of the solution. But they will deliver medium and longer term solutions. A collaborative approach which brings in the best of the public and private sector procurement and contracting capability is needed to address the short-term challenge.</p> <p><strong>The decision-making issue </strong>is a vital one but commercial nous can't be taught: I worked in Whitehall for 15 years or so. Much of that time was spent on commercial matters. This is a good thing obviously, but it cannot be a substitute for a number of skills and abilities. Commercial nous is probably one of them. I'm not sure it can be taught: you've either got it or you haven't. Negotiation, too, requires the individual to have certain personal characteristics. It is not something you can do by rote. So some of this capability (people who already have these skills) needs to be identified and deployed more effectively so that they can add the value that's needed. If it can't be identified and deployed from internal resources quickly enough, it will need to be bought in.</p> <h2>Andy Moran, director of <a href=\"http://www.planprocuremanage.com/\" title=\"\">Plan Procure Manage</a> </h2> <p><strong>External consultants </strong>find it easier to challenge service delivery managers in a way that procurement departments would not. I think a lot of this is to do with the service-delivery-led structure of most councils. Traditionally, procurement has been a reactive support service within maybe the finance department and not had a seat at the top table.</p> <p><strong>Changing expectations </strong>for public sector procurement is at the root, the whole reason for this debate. What is it we expect public sector procurement people to do and, actually, is there more than one type of procurement person. The technical procurement knowledge is really a very small part of the story for a public sector procurement person. It's becoming more and more about business analysis, project management and political awareness.</p> <p><strong>Narrow thinking </strong>must be dispensed with. A few years ago I did some work with a local authority to renegotiate care home contracts and introduce payments linked to quality standards. What struck me most of all was that, when I went out to visit the homes and meet the suppliers, that for all of them it was the first time they had met anyone from the council procurement and commissioning teams. Some of these care homes were being paid over \u00a31m a year.</p> <h2>Gary Bandy, freelance consultant and a former local authority finance director </h2> <p><strong>Local government </strong>procurement hierarchies need adjusting. I don't think I know of any local authority where a procurement specialist is at the top table. There has been a continuing debate for years in local government about whether the finance director should be a member of the top management team, and many authorities do not do it. Private companies that have a significant supply chain would likely have a board director responsible for it. As local authorities, and other public bodies, move further towards a commissioning model, is there a case for them to have a commercial director on their top team?</p> <p><strong>EU procurement objectives </strong>is a way to scrutinise public bodies<strong> </strong>and gives the public confidence.<em> </em>However, over recent years I've detected a growing unease among organisations about the potential for challenge from unsuccessful bidders (and others). I suppose the recent successful appeal by Virgin Trains will exacerbate this uneasiness.</p> <p><strong>If localism is to mean anything </strong>then public bodies should commission bespoke services. This is rather than have a centrally-procured service imposed on them. That's assuming a central unit could, for instance, commission a contract that could be easily implemented piecemeal across the country.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

  "<p>As European leaders lock horns on the next European budget, Andris Piebalgs, the European commissioner for development, faces a tough battle to protect his corner.</p> <p>Negotiations have begun in earnest on the 2014-20 budget. Piebalgs is seeking a total of \u20ac51bn in aid funding (at 2011 prices), compared with \u20ac40.5bn (\u00a333bn) in the last seven-year period, for the EU to meet its commitment to the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid.</p> <p>The coming weeks will be crucial as there is pressure to agree on the numbers for the various pots of money \u2013 common agricultural policy (CAP), development, regional funds \u2013 in time for a budget summit in late November to seal a deal.</p> <p>Piebalgs has bemoaned the fact that while coalitions have formed around particular bits of the budget, he has no \"friends of development\" to back him. In <a href=\"http://www.la-croix.com/Actualite/S-informer/Monde/Andris-Piebalgs-Investir-en-Afrique-c-est-preparer-le-futur-de-l-Europe-_EP_-2012-10-14-864476\" title=\"\">a recent interview with the French newspaper La Croix</a>, Piebalgs said that while the CAP had its supporters, as did regional funds, no one was defending the aid budget. That did not seem to be a preoccupation of member states, he said.</p> <p>There is a \"friends of cohesion\" group led by Robert Fico, the Slovakian prime minister, to protect the large amount the EU spends on poorer regions \"to catch up\". But Piebalgs is playing a weak hand as best he can.</p> <p>This week, as leaders and development officials gathered in Brussels for the <a href=\"http://live.eudevdays.eu/agenda\" title=\"\">EU's development days</a>, an annual forum on development, his office released a survey showing widespread public support for aid for developing countries.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_392_en.pdf\" title=\"\">Eurobarometer survey</a> (pdf), released on Tuesday, 85% of EU citizens believe Europe should continue helping developing countries despite the economic crisis, and 61% are in favour of increasing aid. At the same time, 55% think rapidly growing emerging countries should no longer receive aid. Most people (61%) believe aid should focus on fragile countries that have suffered conflict or natural crises.</p> <p>Piebalgs seized on the survey to argue that policymakers should not axe the aid budget at a time of austerity. \"The EU is about to decide the next seven-year budget and people are sending a clear message to their leaders \u2013 savings should not be made at the expense of the poorest on the planet,\" he said.</p> <p>But supporting EU aid is an uphill battle, especially in the UK. The anti-aid press frequently take potshots at the union for its \"largesse\" on Turkey, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9576399/Senior-Tory-accuses-EU-of-squandering-Britains-aid-budget.html\" title=\"\">or for providing aid to Iceland</a>. The latter is a canard, as Iceland receives no EU aid. Turkey's aid comes from a different pre-accession pot that helps prepare states for membership. There is frustration in Brussels that the UK supports EU spending on Turkey as it favours Ankara's membership, but <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2218107/Stop-sending-aid-money-rich-countries-Cabinet-minister-Justine-Greening-tells-European-Union.html\" title=\"\">criticises the amount of money spent,</a> as Justine Greening, the international development secretary, did in Luxembourg this week.</p> <p>With member states not rushing to Piebalgs's defence, it is left to campaigners to champion EU aid. ONE says <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/blog/ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-european-aid-but-won%E2%80%99t-find-in-the-sunday-telegraph/\" title=\"\">Britain ranks the European commission</a> among the world's top development and humanitarian aid donors, and that the UK's multilateral aid review rated the European development fund, which focuses on African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, as \"critical to UK development objectives\".</p> <p>Piebalgs defends EU aid on the grounds that poverty in Europe is not comparable to Africa, even though people are being hurt by austerity in Europe. He also makes the case for aid on national security grounds, just as Greening did in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/09/justine-greening-uk-aid-budget\" title=\"\">her recent defence of UK aid</a> at the Tory party conference. Piebalgs has proposed that 19 countries, including Brazil, India and Indonesia, no longer receive EU aid as part of his efforts to focus on the poorest countries.</p> <p>With budgets under pressure, some aid campaigners are casting a hopeful eye on attempts by France, among others, to introduce a financial transactions tax (FTT) at EU level. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/oct/17/france-eu-transparency-resource-curse\" title=\"\">France has already done so on a national level</a>, and plans to channel 10% of the money raised towards development. A broader EU FTT backed by France and eight others \u2013 and opposed by the UK on the grounds it would damage the City \u2013 is also being fleshed out, which could raise as much as \u20ac40bn for development, according to some estimates.</p> <p>For the moment, however, Piebalgs has to concentrate on fending off axe-wielders eyeing his budget. Laura Meyer, a research assistant at the <a href=\"http://www.ecdpm.org/\" title=\"\">European Centre for Development Policy Management</a> (ECDPM), a Brussels thinktank, argues that the EU can certainly do a lot for development beyond aid \u2013 in trade and other areas \u2013 but that aid has proved its worth: \"As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/02/is-aid-target-still-relevant\" title=\"\">ECDPM has articulated on numerous occasions</a>, examples can be seen in its trade and other policy areas,\" she says. \"Yet many contend that European aid has made a difference already and that when the general public is <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/blog/category/campaigns/eu-budget/\" title=\"\">engaged and the real impact is demonstrated</a>, it is supportive.\"</p> <p>Eloise Todd, Brussels director of ONE, said: \"In November leaders have the opportunity to make sure that cuts to the EU budget do not cost lives. We need development champions like the UK to protect the part of the budget that could vaccinate 9 million children by 2020. There is one month to save European aid from potentially the biggest cuts ever seen to development spending.\"</p>",
  "<p>Frustration at the eurozone's failure to end its rollercoaster ride of recovery and crisis is palpable in Asia. Leaders from China, Japan and South Korea to Indonesia and the Philippines are desperate for the key eurozone countries to fashion a solution that makes life less traumatic and more conducive to trade.</p> <p>Asian nations have weathered the global economic crisis better than most, but concerns are growing that a prolonged European recession will start to take its toll, particularly if commodity prices continue to decline.</p> <p>Japan, which has embarked on a massive reconstruction effort after last year's tsunami, was expected to recover strongly, but European consumers have stopped spendingforcing down Tokyo's growth to 1.4% in the second quarter. China has also recorded a steep decline in demand for its goods, pushing down its usual double-digit growth rate to 7.8%.</p> <p>Of the two, Japan is more understanding towards Europe, although frustration is palpable when conversation with government officials turns to the question, \"what next for the eurozone?\".</p> <p>One explanation for the diplomatic attitude could be found in Japan's application for a free trade deal with Europe. China has one and so does South Korea, but Japan has been slow off the mark. Criticism of European leaders could harm negotiations. Moreover, Japan is not well placed to lecture others about debt, with a debt-to-GDP ratio far worse than Greece, at about 200%.</p> <p>Chinese officials, on the other hand, have publicly raised concerns about the negative effects of the financial crisis in the west.</p> <p>Chief among Beijing's complaints is the west's reliance on cheap money printed by central banks. Chinese officials are also aghast at the perceived dithering by their European counterparts.</p> <p>\"The way the eurozone has handled the debt resolution issue has been more problematic,\" said Jin Liqun, chairman of the supervisory board at the China Investment Corporation. \"Too much time has been wasted on debates over the terms and conditions of piecemeal bailouts. Political leaders have been digging in on their own agendas, with their objectives pulling in different directions.\" He added: \"I'm afraid to say that frailty, thy name is leadership\".</p> <p>The European Central Bank has refused to follow the quantitative easing programmes of the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, although it has supplied funds to local banks, which in turn have loaned the money to their governments.</p> <p>The expansion in the money supply has depressed the value of western currencies and raised the value of Asian currencies, China and Japan's among them, making their exports more expensive.</p> <p>Naohiro Yashiro, an economics professor at the International Christian University in Tokyo, says the Japanese and Chinese governments could easily support the eurozone by selling some of their loans to the US government and buying eurozone debt. \"Selling the dollar, and buying the Euro bond should be basically neutral to the exchange rate,\" he said.</p> <p>A switch from US Treasury bonds to bonds designed to support indebted countries would bring down borrowing costs and, arguably, give political leaders the confidence they need to reform the currency union and end the crisis. There would be the risk of leaving a safe haven (the US) for a risky project (propping up the euro) but it would be self-fulfilling such is the combined power of China and Japan. It would also prompt a surge in world trade, of which China and Japan would be the chief beneficiares.</p> <p>Japan's prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, supports plans to buy European bonds and effectively increase loans to the eurozone. Japan was one of the first to buy the rescue bonds launched by Brussels and the European Central Bank, although the $430m it committed is small compared to the size of the problem.</p> <p>But under the surface, Asia is focusing on the opportunities to be had \u2013 after hundreds of years of colonialism, buying Europe on the cheap is an opportunity not to be missed. The Chinese have busied themselves buying Greek, Italian and Portugese ports and utilities at knockdown prices.</p> <p>The Japanese advertising company Dentsu recently bought the Anglo/French marketing group Aegis for \u00a33.2bn. More takeovers are expected.</p>",
  "<p>A bigger proportion of UK marketers slashed their ad budgets in the third quarter of 2012 than at any time since the throes of the recession three years ago.</p> <p>The IPA's influential Bellwether survey, which gauges the outlook of the UK marketing industry, found there is a very real chance the amount spent on marketing will decline year on year in 2012.</p> <p>This signifies a massive deterioration in confidence since the start of the year when marketers had believed there would be a \"mild rise\" in spend, fuelled by events such as Euro 2012, the diamond jubilee and the Olympics.</p> <p>As companies looked to control costs to manage profitability in a tough trading environment, they cut back on their marketing budgets.</p> <p>More than a third of companies said they were pessimistic about the prospects for the advertising and marketing industry, while about 30% said they felt negative about the future.</p> <p>\"We had hoped when the year started that things were picking up but as time has gone on the economy has stuttered and confidence isn't particularly strong,\" said the IPA president, Nicola Mendelsohn.</p> <p>A breakdown of the survey data showed marketers are cutting budgets to all media \u2013 from TV and radio to cinema and outdoor advertising \u2013 except the internet.</p> <p>Budgets for internet advertising grew for the 13th quarter in a row.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Britain's laws to tackle wildlife crime \u2013 such as the poisoning of birds of prey and illegal trading of species online \u2013 are a \"mess\", an influential committee of MPs said on Thursday.</p> <p>The report from the environmental audit committee comes amid fears over the funding of the police's <a href=\"http://www.north-wales.police.uk/nwcu/home.asp\" title=\"\">National Wildlife Crime Unit</a> (NWCU), which is due to expire in March next year and has not yet been guaranteed by the government.</p> <p>While laws to protect wildlife in the UK exist, the committee acknowledges, their power is undermined as they are \"scattered across various statutes and regulations\". The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) told the committee \"conservation legislation is, in our view, badly in need of consolidation\".</p> <p>Several laws, such as the Night Poaching Act of 1828 and the Game Act of 1831, are archaic, for example, while the main legislation under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 is difficult for non-wildlife specialist lawyers to use. The <a href=\"http://lawcommission.justice.gov.uk/consultations/wildlife.htm\" title=\"\">Law Commission is currently consulting on wildlife laws</a>, which it calls \"a legal landscape that is out of date, confused and often contradictory.\"</p> <p>Prosecution of cases, such as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/23/poisoned-peregrine-falcons-rspb-reward\" title=\"\">poisoning of peregrine falcons</a>, is also hampered by a lack of knowledge in the Crown Prosecution Service and \"inconsistent sentencing by judges and magistrates\", the report says. \"We have an issue with continuity with the CPS because there aren't specialist prosecutors for wildlife,\" Stephanie Pendry, enforcement programme leader at the wildlife trade monitoring NGO Traffic, told the committee.</p> <p>If successfully prosecuted, most wildlife crimes in the UK incur a maximum \u00a35,000 fine and/or a maximum sentence of six months.</p> <p>Joan Walley, the committee's chair, said: \"Police officers dealing with wildlife crime are having to wrestle with legal arrangements that are almost Pythonesque in their absurdity; like the requirement to summon a vet to take a sample from any endangered species entering the country \u2013 even if it happens to be a piece of mahogany furniture.</p> <p>\"Wildlife protection law in the UK is in a mess after being patched up too many times in an effort to keep pace with offending. The law needs to be consolidated and the courts need to be given clear sentencing guidelines.\"</p> <p>Uncertainty over the long-term funding of the NWCU is also undermining its ability to carry out enforcement, the committee heard, as it is constantly under review. Nevin Hunter, the head of the unit, said: \"\u2026 A lot of the challenge that I have is to constantly look at securing the future funding, which takes me away from that day-to-day role of trying to address wildlife crime.\"</p> <p>The unit is relatively small, with a staff of just 15, and its \u00a3397,000 funding largely split between the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Its funding for 2012-13 has already been cut 10% against 2011-12.</p> <p>Heather Sohl, senior species policy officer for WWF-UK said: \"Today, the committee has rightly acknowledged that the UK has made good progress in the last eight years, but to build on success we need the government to recognise that the NWCU needs long-term funding to help stop wildlife crime.\"</p> <p>Lord Henley, the then parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Defra, <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenvaud/c140-iii/c14001.htm\" title=\"\">said in August</a> that he could not \"make any positive guarantee\" over the unit's funding, and even if a decision was taken to cease funding, \"other funds [are] going into policing and dealing with these matters\".</p> <p>Martin Harper, the RSPB's conservation director, said in 2011 there were 100 reports of poisoning incidents of birds of prey, highlighting the need for action: \"We are delighted that the environmental audit committee shares our concerns about wildlife crime \u2013 particularly those affecting birds of prey. We urge the government to heed this advice and we trust it will now take the lead on consigning these acts to history. The committee has clearly signalled that the game is up for wildlife criminals and it's time for a step change in wildlife crime enforcement.\"</p> <p>A Defra spokeswoman said: \"The government takes the issue of wildlife crime seriously. That is why we fund the National Wildlife Crime Unit, who work to bring these criminals to justice. We will consider the committee's recommendations carefully and will respond in December.\"</p> <p>In a statement, the Environmental Investigation Agency, said it welcomed the report and was: \"strongly supportive of the committee's call on the government to urgently address failings in current UK wildlife protection legislation. In terms of international wildlife crime, EIA is glad to see the committee urging the UK government to exert 'robust diplomatic pressure' in seeking the development and enforcement of wildlife law at the next Cites meeting in March 2013.\"</p>",

Oh well. It could be worse, the NLCS Game 3 actually happened unlike the ALCS Game 4. The St. Louis Cardinals take a 2-1 series lead, thanks to Matt Carpenter who replaced Carlos Beltran, day-to-day with a knee injury. Certainly this seems to shift the series in the Cardinals' favor but these two teams seem too evenly matched to give one an overwhelming advantage.</p> <p>Tomorrow night the Giants will bring out, well somebody, to be the starting pitcher against the Cardinals' Adam Wainwright in Game 4 of the NLCS. The game begins at 8:00pm EST tomorrow, assuming that the weather decides to cooperate this time around, and we'll be liveblogging it here in the Guardian. That will do it for me. I won't lie, may be more than a little exhausted after all that. Thanks to everyone for reading, especially those who who stuck with me and/or kept me company during that lengthy rain delay.

Wow is Motte just unconscious right now.</p> <p>Motte's next pitch. Outside. 1-2. The crowd wants a strikeout, badly. Sandoval hits a flyball to center and that will do it.

I'm going to go the lazy student route here and copy and paste from Wikipedia:</p> <blockquote> <p>Umpires are required by rule to wait at least 30 minutes to see if conditions improve; this is referred to as a <strong>rain delay</strong> and is not counted as part of the length of the game listed in the box score. In practice, umpires are encouraged to see that games are played if at all possible, and will sometimes wait as long as three hours before declaring a rainout.</p> </blockquote> <p>Now, here's the thing about the postseason. In the regular season, if this game were called, the Cardinals would have won as they have the lead and it's an official game (meaning it's gone five full innings). However, in the postseason, any games called during a rain delay have to be played to completion. So, say they call this game in a few hours because it's just not going to be playable. That means they restart this game, say tomorrow, in the same situation that it is now: Runners on second and third, two out, bottom of the seventh. Obviously the personnel would be different.</p> <p>Does this make any sense? Essentially teams have to play at least nine inning games to win postseason games, no matter what the conditions.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T23:06:46.596Z\">at 12.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507f3647c0e361310bc6d110\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T22:50:47.930Z\">11.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Emails</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From Chas Powell:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hi<br>Enjoying your liveblogging the NL Championship from WAY down under (Sydney)<br>Go Cards!!<br>kind rgds<br>chas powell <br>ps or should I say, keep the tornados at bay! ;)</p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks.

It only makes sense that I would be covering his Game 3 NLCS start, having become <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/11/st-louis-cardinals-washington-nationals-nlds-game-4-live\">something of his Boswell</a> considering that this is Lohse's most important start of the year. The Cardinals are returning home to Busch Stadium to face the San Francisco Giants in a National League Championship Series tied up 1-1. Game 3 could potentially be the turning point of the series, especially since the Giants looking to regain home field advantage with a win on the road.</p> <p>The Giants are also extra-motivated after the events of their NLCS Game 2 win. Cardinals outfielder Matt Holliday took out Giants shortstop Marco Scutaro <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121016&amp;content_id=39854216&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb\">when making a hard slide trying to break up a double play</a>. Scutaro stayed in the game, but his status for this afternoon's game is in doubt. Now, Scutaro immediate revenge on the field as he got a crucial hit that drove in three key runs that helped<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/16/st-louis-cardinals-san-francisco-giants-nlcs-game-two-live\"> seal the Cardinals 7-1</a> victory, but there's the very real possibility that this could be a very chippy game. If hitters on either side start getting plunked, whether it's accidental or on purpose, watch out for some potential fireworks. We are on official bench-clearing watch, people, this is not a drill.</p> <p>On the mound for the Giants? That would be their ace Matt Cain, who kept the team in the playoff mix while former stopper Tim Lincecum struggled. The underrated hurler achieved some additional renown this year when he threw a <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2012/06/matt-cain-perfect-game-sandy-koufax-kerry-wood/1#.UH6pqnDvbos\">perfect game</a> on June 13th against the Houston Astros. He'll be on hand to try to prevent the Cardinals from continuing yet another improbable playoff run. This would fulfill the desires of countless baseball fans who are beginning to see the Cardinals as the <a href=\"http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/39813962/\">National League version of the New York Yankees</a> (who, in case you were wondering, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/17/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-alcs-game-3-live\">fell to the 0-3 in the American League Championship Series last night after losing to the Detroit Tigers 2-1</a>).</p> <p>Of course, there's a question about if the game is actually going to start. The weather report around game time says there's about an 80% chance of rain. There's been discussion off and on today about delaying the game or postponing it altogether. We'll see how this goes. Fingers-crossed we'll have baseball sooner rather than later. After all, if the Yankees are eliminated tonight, that means no more double-headers this year, and that would just be sad.</p> <p>We want to hear from you throughout the game.

You still have some time before the game starts as first pitch is scheduled somewhere around 4:00pm EST, and a lot more time if the game is under a rain delay. It's the <a href=\"http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/preview?gameId=321017124\">San Francisco Giants vs. the St. Louis Cardinals</a> at Busch Stadium for an all-important NLCS Game 3. We hope, at least. We'll be back with starting lineups in a few minutes, unless we're shut down by Paul Simon's copyright lawyers.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T19:39:10.243Z\">at 8.39pm BST</time></p>  </div>"
