  "<p>Helen Gurley Brown, the author and journalist credited with introducing frank discussions of sex into magazines for women during her 32-year career as the editor of Cosmopolitan, has died at the age of 90.</p> <p>Brown was already at the forefront of influencing a change in sexual mores when she wrote Sex and the Single Girl, published in 1962, about her single life, encouraging women to have sex freely, regardless of their marital status.</p> <p>But it was at the helm of Cosmopolitan, which she transformed from being an often straitlaced publication aimed at suburban housewives into one that built a global readership based on Brown and her colleagues' idealised image of the sexually liberated, career-focused \"Cosmo girl\".</p> <p>New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city had \"lost a pioneer who reshaped not only the entire media industry but the culture of the US\". He added: \"She was a role model for the millions of women whose private thoughts, wonders and dreams she addressed so brilliantly in print. She was a quintessential New Yorker: never afraid to speak her mind and always full of advice. She pushed boundaries and often broke them, clearing the way for younger women to follow in her path.\"</p> <p>Sex and the City author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CandaceBushnell/status/235108176461168640\" title=\"\">Candace Bushnell tweeted</a>: \"This really is the end of an era.\"</p> <p>Born into a family of modest means in rural Arkansas, Brown became a writer of advertising copy on the US West Coast after working at a string of secretarial jobs.</p> <p>She was 37 when she married twice-divorced David Brown, a former Cosmopolitan managing editor turned movie producer who encouraged her to write a book. Sex and the Single Girl, her collection of advice, opinion and anecdote on why being single shouldn't mean being sexless, made her a celebrity and became one of the top sellers of 1962 in the US. Five more books followed, including Having It All in 1982 and in 1993, at age 71, The Late Show, which was subtitled A Semiwild but Practical Survival Plan for Women Over 50.</p> <p>Brown was hired three years later by Hearst Magazines to turn around Cosmopolitan, declaring that her aim was to tell a reader \"how to get everything out of life \u2013 the money, recognition, success, men, prestige, authority, dignity, whatever she is looking at through the glass her nose is pressed against\".</p> <p>Titillating cover lines became synonymous with the title, where sales grew every year until peaking at just over three million in 1983, before slowly levelling off to 2.5 million, where it was when Brown left in 1997.</p> <p>Brown's focus on sex and approval of cosmetic surgery made her a controversial figure among many who suggested she was saying women should work the system rather than overthrow it.</p> <p>Brown died on Monday at a hospital in New York.</p>",
  "<p>The weakest level of property sales in four years is pushing down house prices in all regions of the UK outside London, says the body representing estate agents.</p> <p>The monthly snapshot of the property market from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors found that home transactions in July dropped for a fourth month and the balance of surveyors reporting falling prices was at its highest level for a year.</p> <p>RICS said its members expected prices to continue edging downwards over the coming months even though they are hopeful that the number of sales will increase in the second half of 2012.</p> <p>Asked about the trend in prices over the past month, a balance of -24 percentage points of agents said they were falling. The figure in June was -22 points.</p> <p>RICS found that most surveyors reporting price falls said they were down by less than 2%, but said there was a distinct north-south divide with London prices rising and downward pressure weakest in the south-east.</p> <p>Peter Bolton King, RICS's global residential director, said: \"Despite the terrible weather seen in many parts of the county last month, a steady number of potential buyers still got out there to test the market. However, this didn't result in a higher level of actual transactions. Fewer sellers are putting their homes up for sale and the ongoing problem of accessing affordable finance is not helping. If vendors want to sell their homes quickly, they will have to be realistic in their price expectations.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 We will clean the barn, said Rupert Murdoch, reacting to the many and varied claims of wrongdoing within his organisation. And, to a degree, he has been as good as his word. The mogul's management standards operation has been shopping journalists to the police with a frequency that even an East End nark would find alarming. But the broom, we fear, hasn't quite swept clean other parts of the Murdoch empire, where still there are alleged transgressions that would worry Lord Justice Leveson. One such is a big story that appeared last week on the front page of Murdoch's Post-Courier in Papua New Guinea. \"Govt approves seabed mining,\" it said, and it was jolly exciting. Just as exciting, notes a blogger, as it was when the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/06/papua-new-guinea-deep-sea-mining\" title=\"\">same story appeared in the Guardian on 6 August</a>. Written for us by Australian journalist Oliver Milman, the story quoted protester Helen Rosenbaum. \"PNG is the guinea pig for deep sea mining,\" she told him. \"The mining companies are waiting in the wings ready to pile in. It's a new frontier, which is a worrying development.\" Which is exactly as she was quoted in the Post-Courier version. Milman also spoke directly to Wenceslaus Magun, an activist: \"We are really concerned because the sea is the source of our spirituality and sustenance,\" said the activist.\" The company has not explained to us the risks of deep sea mining.\" And guess what, he apparently said exactly the same thing in exactly the same way to the Murdoch paper. Steve Rogers, chief executive of Nautilus, the company leading the mining, promised: \"This will be a relatively small footprint compared to a mine on land, on an area about the size of a dozen football pitches. \"We've sought out the best scientists in the world. We aren't trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes.\" Which, again, is exactly as he was quoted in the Post-Courier. Milman tells us from Perth that he had no dealing with the paper. Which could mean that there have been a lot of coincidences. It could also mean that Rupert owes him a nice fat cheque.</p> <p>\u2022 The busiest day for British border staff, as the Olympians and those associated fly home. And arising from a busy weekend, a message to Theresa May from the UK border toilers at Calais-Fr\u00e9thun Eurostar station: \"Buy us some new computers!\" This would avoid the half-hour delay that occurred last Saturday evening as 20 or so passengers \u2013 including small children \u2013 had to stand waiting while staff went to find a replacement laptop. French police IT worked like a dream. \"Nos coll\u00e8gues britanniques sont bloqu\u00e9s comme toujours,\" (\"Our British colleagues are blocked as usual\") was their half-pitying, half-amused comment. Get Lord Coe on to it, we say. He can fix anything.</p> <p>\u2022 You love Mo Farah, we love Mo Farah. The Olympian's Olympian has one of the most recognisable faces on the planet. Recognisable perhaps even to border force officials, who apparently took a good hard look at unassuming Mo as he entered his country to do his bit in the Olympics. One suspects that won't happen again.</p> <p>\u2022 And there was a heartfelt adieu in Tower Hamlets, London, where the mayor Lutfur Rahman bade farewell to the army and navy personnel who had set up a temporary billet near the Tower of London. Well done, our boys and girls, said Rahman, the first directly elected Muslim mayor; and by way of thanks he promised them all a Brick Lane curry. A notable <a href=\"http://www.whatsinwapping.co.uk/olympic-military-farewell-ceremony-in-wapping-rose-gardens-13082012/\" title=\"\">spectator was Helen Mirren</a>, who posed with everybody. Or it might have been the Queen. So hard to tell these days.</p> <p>\u2022 Who else will be sad that the Olympics is over? Well there may well be a post-Games dip among members of L Ron Hubbard's Scientology organisation. For they seemed to be doing good business around Tower Bridge, handing out literature linked to the organisation. The little booklets promised The Truth About Drugs. Neither Scientology nor L Ron are mentioned. Just his Foundation for a Drug-Free World, the web address for which sits on the Scientology website. Everyone was fair game this weekend. Even a passing 15-year-old. That sort of opportunity might not come again.</p> <p><em> </em></p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>With the late-in-the-day <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/09/sir-john-major-london-2012-games?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">lauding of Sir John</a>, and with Tony <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9744000/9744370.stm\" title=\"\">taking to the studios</a> once again, Olympic season has unexpectedly proved to be something of a comeback moment for former prime ministers. On Monday night at the Edinburgh international book festival, Gordon got in on the action as well.</p> <p>Sometimes in return for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/12/gordon-brown-to-speak-in-las-vegas\" title=\"\">a chunky fee</a> and sometimes not, the Brown verdict on the global economy has been given from time to time since he left No 10. In politics, however, he has determinedly held his tongue since his defeat \u2013 entering the fray only where moved by a deeply personal rage at the Murdoch empire's treatment of his family. Now the great <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6147766.stm\" title=\"\">clunking fist</a> has swung back into combat. Its target: Alex Salmond's dreams of independence.</p> <p>In England, Mr Brown remains too unpopular a figure to be able to do much for any campaign; the longer period of silence required before a Major or Blair reappraisal were conceivable will be unavoidable in his case too. Scotland, however, is another political country. The last prime minister was always more respected there, holding on to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/region/7.stm\" title=\"\">every one of its many Labour constituencies</a>, even as he slid to UK-wide defeat. It should not be assumed that an intervention, which was a reminder of Brownian strengths as well as Brownian weaknesses, will be counterproductive.</p> <p>The language was a little leaden and it came with tables of economic data to reinforce the points. But some real ideas sparkled through. The union was painted as the happy marriage of the Scottish values of \"justice and community\" and the English virtues of \"ordered liberty and individualism\", a rather fanciful way to describe the chaotic path to political unity that this island took, although this most bookish of leaders would be perfectly able to provide scholarly justification for it. This high rhetoric came laced with the dash of low politics that seasoned Brown-watchers would expect.</p> <p>Now freed of the burdens of office himself, the former PM has woken up to the damage that Labour's \"insider\" status in Scottish politics has done the party. After the nationalists formed a minority administration in 2007, the Labour opposition ended up carping about popular policies, such as axing prescription charges on technocratic grounds, freeing Mr&#xa0;Salmond to claim to be the authentic voice of Scotland's social democratic mainstream.</p> <p>The first minister also talks about compassion and solidarity as specifically Scottish values. Mr Brown now seeks to snooker him, by adding the twist that these ideals find their concrete expression in an NHS sustained by UK-wide revenues, a welfare safety net which straddles the border and \u2013 inevitably \u2013 the successes of Team GB.</p> <p>If Scotland's No campaign is another Team GB, Mr Brown has the passion as well as the initials to join their fight.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2012. The original referred to Gordon Brown's speech at the Edinburgh festival rather than the Edinburgh international book festival. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Next Sunday, 19 August, is <a href=\"http://www.un.org/en/events/humanitarianday/\">World Humanitarian Day</a>.</p> <p>You probably have not yet gotten the <a href=\"http://www.unocha.org/top-stories/all-stories/world-humanitarian-day-2012\">memo about this \"global day to celebrate humanity and the spirit of people helping people\"</a>, but quite likely you will. Or, at least, so far, more than 100 million people are on the list to get it.</p> <p>World Humanitarian Day is \u2026 well, I have no idea what it actually is. It is meant, in some way, to commemorate the work of S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello, the high-ranking United Nations official who was killed in Baghdad in 2003. De Mello was from Brazil and Brazil is a new world power, and getting the UN to sponsor World Humanitarian Day is a demonstration of its enhanced status. </p> <p>Every congress, or legislative body, or communal gathering the world over has various parties and interests who are always coming up with ceremonial or commemorative or self-congratulatory or plain old PR puffery occasions. The vast majority of them go unacknowledged. But some \u2013 like, say, Mother's Day \u2013 enter the popular imagination and marketing quick stream; that is, they go viral.</p> <p>At first glance, it would hardly seem that World Humanitarian Day has such potential. And yet, it has a few things going for it: a kind of inclusiveness, and lack of specificity, and general positive energy, that is hard to argue with. The standard here for promotable nebulous international altruism is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glny4jSciVI\">\"We Are the World\"</a>, which, if it did nothing else, redounded to the credit of the music industry.</p> <p>World Humanitarian Day has recruited Beyonce Knowles to be its face and she will release a video of her song \"I Was Here\", filmed in the UN general assembly, to mark the day. It is obviously good for Beyonce Knowles if World Humanitarian Day becomes Beyonce's World Humanitarian Day (rather then S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello's).</p> <p>Such an event ultimately derives its success from a kind of mutuality of promotional benefits. The more people (that is, celebrities) and enterprises whose aims it furthers, the more potential it has. Along with the S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello Foundation, Brazil, the UN, and Beyonce, World Humanitarian Day has the makers of the new technology platform, Thunderclap, promoting it. </p> <p>Thunderclap is a novel tool that could push World Humanitarian Day up there with \"We Are the World\" and Mother's Day and, to boot, make Beyonce Knowles more beloved than she already is. Likewise, World Humanitarian Day could turn Thunderclap into an incredibly important, as well as potentially really irritating, technological force.</p> <p>Thunderclap has been developed by the hottest advertising agency in the US, Droga5, and seeks to address the most burning question in marketing circles today, \"social media, what is it good for?\"</p> <p>Or, how in the hell, in the babble of social media, do you make a message stand out?</p> <p>This is not a small question. The lack of an answer has already shaved some $40bn off of Facebook's value (which could have provided a lot of humanitarian aid). </p> <p>Thunderclap's proprietary proposition is as follows: here's a platform that can be used to harbor, or horde, social media messages, in such a way that they can all be released at the exact same moment, achieving that most sought-after and elusive marketing status: impact. In other words, lots of people can get together and bundle their followers, like political dollars, and, theoretically, create a viral, or tidal wave, effect.</p> <p>Thus, next Sunday, 100 million people, representing, in addition to Beyonce's millions of followers, the followers of, among others, Chris Brown, William Shatner, Piers Morgan, and InStyle magazine will get <a href=\"https://www.thunderclap.it/whd-iwashere\">a message about it being World Humanitarian Day</a>. (Ideally, of course, there will be lot and lots of nobodies who also add their random followers to this great movement.)</p> <p>Advertising works best when everybody gets the same message at the same time, thereby creating a shared experience \u2013 the Super Bowl model, if you will. Social media's operation, on the other hand, tends to be a random and, most often, a one-to-one experience. The vaunted viral promise is unpredictable.</p> <p>This is a problem not only for the ad industry, which sells predictability, but for the purveyors of social media. They have built a system of asynchronous messaging, but now have to make money through advertising which is built on \u2026 synchronous messaging.</p> <p>Hence the real work of World Humanitarian Day and the Thunderclap platform: saving social media.</p> <p>A spontaneous version of World Humanitarian Day might be something like the viral Kony 2012 campaign, wherein a group seeking the arrest of Uganda war criminal Joseph Kony made a short film seen by over 100 million people. Advertising methodology tries to take what works organically in the culture and commodify it. Thunderclap offers the possibility of not just, in this instance, helping to encourage humanitarianism, but of bringing some consistency and order to viral marketing. </p> <p>The possibility that there might actually be such a method or a platform that could lend structure and control to a message and its distribution is what allows Mark Zuckerberg to believe that Facebook will not end up like Yahoo.</p> <p>So, if, next Sunday, you suddenly find yourself thinking humanitarian thoughts and humming Beyonce's \"I Was Here\", then social media may have been saved \u2026 if not human suffering alleviated. </p> <p>If, on the other hand, it passes unnoticed, then the cause that has been advanced here most of all is spam.</p>",
  "<p>I don't blame <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2187355/David-Cameron-celebrates-Mo-Farah-ahead-No-10-summit.html\" title=\"\">Mo Farah, Pele and Haile Gebrselassie</a>, who lined up, all hugs and smiles, outside Downing Street for a photocall at the prime minister's hunger summit. Perhaps they were unaware of the way in which they were being used to promote David Cameron's corporate and paternalistic approach to overseas aid. Perhaps they were also unaware of the crime against humanity over which he presides. Perhaps Cameron himself is unaware of it.</p> <p>You should by now have heard about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/18/european-commission-sahel-hunger-crisis\" title=\"\">famine developing in the Sahel region of west Africa</a>. Poor harvests and&#xa0;high food prices threaten the lives of some 18 million people. The global price of food is likely to rise still further, as a result of low crop yields in the United States, caused by the worst drought in 50 years. World cereal prices,&#xa0;in response to this disaster, climbed 17% last month.</p> <p>We have been cautious about attributing such events to climate change: perhaps too cautious. A new paper by James Hansen, head of Nasa's <a href=\"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/\" title=\"\">Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a>, shows that there has been a sharp increase in the frequency of extremely hot summers. Between 1951 and 1980 these events affected between 0.1 and 0.2% of the world's land surface each year. Now, on average, they affect 10%. Hansen explains that \"the odds that natural variability created these extremes are minuscule, vanishingly small\". Both the&#xa0;droughts in the Sahel and the US crop failures are likely to be the result of&#xa0;climate change.</p> <p>But this is not the only sense in which&#xa0;the rich world's use of fuel is causing the poor to starve. In the United&#xa0;Kingdom, in the rest of the European Union and in the United States, governments have chosen to deploy a cure as bad as the disease. Despite overwhelming evidence of the harm their policy is causing, none of them will change course.</p> <p>Biofuels are the means by which governments in the rich world avoid hard choices. Rather than raise fuel economy standards as far as technology allows, rather than promoting a shift from driving to public transport, walking and cycling, rather than insisting on better town planning to reduce the need to travel, they have chosen to exchange our wild overconsumption of petroleum for the wild overconsumption of fuel made from crops. No one has to drive less or make a better car: everything remains the same except the source of fuel. The result is a competition between the world's richest and poorest&#xa0;consumers, a contest between overconsumption and survival.</p> <p>There was never any doubt about which side would win.</p> <p>I've been banging on about this since 2004, and everything I warned of then has happened. The US and the European Union have both set targets and created generous financial incentives for the use of biofuels. The results have been a disaster for people and the planet.</p> <p>Already, 40% of US corn (maize) production is used to feed cars. The proportion will rise this year as a result of the smaller harvest.</p> <p>Though the market for biodiesel is largely confined to the European Union, it has already captured 7% of the world's output of vegetable oil. The European commission admits that its target (10% of transport fuels by 2020) will raise world cereal prices by between 3% and 6%. Oxfam estimates that with every 1% increase in the price of food, another 16 million people go hungry.</p> <p>By 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says that 14% of the world's maize and other coarse grains, 16% of its vegetable oil and 34% of its sugarcane will be used to make people in the gas-guzzling nations feel better about themselves. The demand for biofuel will be met, it reports, partly through an increase in production; partly through a \"reduction in human consumption\". The poor will starve so that the rich can drive.</p> <p>The rich world's demand for biofuels is already causing a global land grab. ActionAid estimates that European companies have now seized 5m hectares of farmland \u2013 an area the size of Denmark \u2013 in developing countries for industrial biofuel production. Small farmers, growing food for themselves and local markets, have been thrown off their land and destituted. Tropical forests, savannahs and grasslands have been cleared to plant what the industry still calls \"green fuels\".</p> <p>When the impacts of land clearance and the use of nitrogen fertilisers are taken into account, biofuels produce more greenhouse gases than fossil fuels&#xa0;do. The UK, which claims that half&#xa0;the biofuel sold here meets its sustainability criteria, solves this problem by excluding the greenhouse gas emissions caused by changes in land use. Its sustainability criteria are, as a result, worthless.</p> <p>Even second-generation biofuels, made from crop wastes or wood, are an environmental disaster, either extending the cultivated area or removing the straw and stovers which protect the soil from erosion and keep carbon and nutrients in the ground. The combination of first- and second-generation biofuels \u2013 encouraging farmers to plough up grasslands and to leave the soil bare \u2013 and hot summers could create the perfect conditions for a new dust bowl.</p> <p>Our government knows all this. One of its own studies shows that if the European Union stopped producing biofuels, the amount of vegetable oils it exported to world markets would rise by 20% and the amount of wheat by 33%, reducing world prices.</p> <p>Preparing for the prime minister's hunger summit on Sunday, the international development department argued that, with a rising population, \"the food production system will need to be radically overhauled, not just to produce&#xa0;more food but to produce it sustainably and fairly to ensure that the poorest people have the access to food that they need\". But another government department \u2013 transport \u2013 boasts on&#xa0;its website that, thanks to its policies, drivers in this country have now used 4.4bn litres of biofuel.</p> <p>Of this 30% was produced from recycled cooking oil. The rest consists of 3bn litres of refined energy snatched from the mouths of the people that Cameron claims to be helping.</p> <p>Some of those to whom the government is now extending its \"nutrition interventions\" may have been starved by its own policies. In this and other ways, David Cameron, with the unwitting support of various sporting heroes, is offering charity, not justice. And that is no basis for liberating the poor.</p> <p>\u2022 For a fully referenced version of this article, visit <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\">George Monbiot's website</a></p>",
  "<p>England have stressed that the door remains open for Kevin Pietersen to return to international cricket, if only he will address the allegations that he was in text contact with members of the opposition during the second Test at Headingley. But is it really plausible, now that his isolation in the dressing room has been so starkly highlighted, that he could play for his adopted country again?</p> <p>\"I know for a fact there are players in this England side who cannot stand Kevin Pietersen,\" the former captain Nasser Hussain wrote in his newspaper column on Monday. There were no obvious signs of that when Pietersen was playing a key role on the last Ashes tour, although close observers of the squad have apparently been aware for years of the tension between the star batsman and several other senior players.</p> <p>Anyone who has played team sport knows that should not be such a surprise and need not be a major problem. Shane Warne, a long-term friend and ally of Pietersen's, made that point when rushing to his defence on Twitter. \"It's more important to be respected than liked in a team environment and for that matter in life,\" argued the great Australian leg-spinner, who was known to have an especially prickly relationship with Adam Gilchrist, the wicketkeeper who was involved in a fair proportion of his dismissals. \"I didn't like some players,\" Warne confirmed. \"But everyone is different \u2013 it's up to the leadership group to make everyone feel special and important.\"</p> <p>Warne clearly blames England's team director, Andy Flower, the captain, Andrew Strauss, or both for Pietersen's exile, whether it turns out to be temporary or permanent. \"For English cricket to be in this situation after so much good work, there's only one way now for our friendly English buddies and that's unfortunately down the rankings,\" he added.</p> <p>\"It's hard to work out how it has got this bad. Management and leadership has to be looked at. KP [is] accepting responsibility and says he behaved in a silly way in some areas too. But if KP was made to feel important, which he is to the England cricket team, then this situation would never have happened.\"</p> <p>Warne would presumably concede that he is biased but he also overlooks one key factor in this dispute \u2013 the fact that Pietersen is South African and was texting not only friends but compatriots in the opposition team. His England team-mates had already seen him fraternising with the tourists on the Headingley outfield on the morning of the toss, with suggestions that he then swore in Afrikaans after being rebuked by Flower and Strauss.</p> <p>Pietersen's apologists could, and doubtless would, argue that all this behaviour represented a failure of management and that his fractious relationship with other major characters in the dressing room, and growing isolation, should have been nipped in the bud much earlier. But history would suggest that is much easier said than done.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire tried it when Pietersen, who had joined them as a youngster from Natal, asked to leave Trent Bridge because he felt unhappy and unloved when they were relegated in 2003. They tried to repair relations but at the end of the following season they decided it was better to allow him to leave \u2013 to join Warne at Hampshire.</p> <p>Rod Bransgrove, the Hampshire chairman, was no more impressed when he first learned of Pietersen's desire to leave the county for Surrey through the media in 2010. Pietersen also dumped English cricket in its last comparable crisis by attempting to have Peter Moores replaced as the England coach \u2013 a move that cost him the captaincy, an appointment which now appears more unlikely and foolhardy than ever. Perhaps he is simply unmanageable. Flower has done his best, despite the knowledge that Pietersen had wanted him removed from the role as batting coach that he filled under Moores. Strauss has bent over backwards not to offend, in the knowledge that he inherited the captaincy from Pietersen.</p> <p>Matt Prior, another of the senior men in the England set-up who was close to Moores, took it upon himself to try to sort things out last Saturday afternoon, after Pietersen had held his meetings with Strauss, Flower and senior England and Wales Cricket Board officials the previous day \u2013 when he was informed of the need to either deny or own up to sending disloyal texts. Perhaps that conversation with Prior may hold out the hope of Pietersen being assimilated back into the dressing room, if not quite starting from scratch, at some point in the future.</p> <p>England will spend much of the winter on the subcontinent, defending their world Twenty20 title in Sri Lanka before playing four Tests in India before Christmas and returning for a one-day series in the New Year. Pietersen's presence there would greatly enhance their prospects, just as it would provide him with a platform to reinforce his profile in India, with the financial benefits that ensue. Crucially he would no longer be playing against his compatriots \u2013 although the influence of the Indian Premier League means that Pietersen will almost certainly have friends and team-mates from the Delhi Daredevils in the opposition, even if they do not speak Afrikaans.</p>",
  "<p>If you thought scientists were quiet types who pulled their lab coats over their heads at the first whiff of confrontation, try saying five letters out loud in a university near you this summer \u2013 EPSRC. Leading chemists, physicists and mathematicians are at war with their major funder, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. They accuse the council of being out of touch and arrogant, ignoring scientific expertise and fostering mediocre science.</p> <p>With a government spending review widely expected next year, and academics close to Westminster warning that science cannot expect the cushioning it was given in the 2010 settlement, the rebellion is causing serious waves. Ministers are said to be exasperated that this has exploded on to the public stage, and influential figures including Nobel laureate Sir Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society, are battling behind the scenes to encourage a resolution.</p> <p>The vice-chancellor of one research university sums up the anger in the sector: \"The EPSRC is a mess. It is perfectly reasonable that it has to take measures to deal with reduced funding. But there is a much wider concern that it has lost touch with the scientists. I know of several examples of council staff saying that something is too important to be left to the academics.\"</p> <p>This is not small fry. The council gives around \u00a3950m of critical research funding to chemists, physicists, mathematicians and engineers a year, making it the biggest player in this area in the UK.</p> <p>At the heart of the controversy is the EPSRC's \"shaping capability\" agenda, which aims to refocus the council's tight budget on areas of excellence and national importance. Overall, 14 of the 113 subjects the council funds have been marked for reduced funding, including synthetic organic chemistry and mathematical physics, with 17 areas flagged for growth.</p> <p>The community was quick to mobilise its big guns when the first cuts were announced last summer. David Cameron received a letter from 25 famous mathematicians slamming the \"unaccountable quango\", followed closely by another from 100 big-name chemists. In May this year, a group of academics parked a hearse outside parliament to mourn the death of science at the hands of the EPSRC. And more protests are on the cards.</p> <p>Yet they insist that this is not mere flouncing about reduced budgets.</p> <p>Prof Tony Barrett, head of synthetic chemistry at Imperial College London and the leader of the Science for the Future protest group, claims that \"untrained\" civil servants in the council's Swindon offices wield too much power. He is angry that they failed to consult the learned societies properly about their policy changes. \"The people who are happy to be told what to work on by EPSRC bureaucrats are usually the second-raters,\" he adds.</p> <p>Prof Tom Simpson, a senior chemist at Bristol University, agrees: \"My feeling is the council doesn't have much of a grasp of what actually goes on at the research level. Why not ask the scientists? They have this term, 'we have informed the community'. That means 'we've taken a decision and then told everybody'. That's not what consultation means.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the head of one major university describes how EPSRC staff have tried to tell very senior scientists what to do in their research: \"It is ridiculous because they don't have the expertise.\"</p> <p>Nurse, winner of the 2001 Nobel prize for physiology or medicine, is more diplomatic than many of his society's fellows have been about the EPSRC. But he agrees the body needs to demonstrate that it is really listening to researchers. \"Empowering individual scientists at the coal face is the way you deliver what the public needs. On the whole I think you should leave decisions about what to fund to the practising scientists rather than to civil servants or even senior figures like me who are getting rather past it.\"</p> <p>Until now, there has been little in the way of public conciliation from the EPSRC. However, there is hope that the council's new chair, former energy company chief executive Paul Golby, may have a serious chance to unite the divided parties. Although sources close to Golby say that he had no real idea how entrenched the conflict was when he accepted the post, he is rolling up his sleeves and getting stuck in.</p> <p>Like David Delpy, the council's beleaguered chief executive, Golby points out that a certain amount of grief was inevitable. \"We are in a very difficult economic climate,\" he says, \"and some people are always going to be resistant to change.\" But he doesn't claim that the council has got everything right. And he is spending his summer quietly visiting key individuals \u2013 including some of the council's most vociferous critics \u2013 trying to understand the issues at lab level.</p> <p>\"One doesn't get this level of noise without there being some issues that need looking at,\" he says. \"Whether they are misunderstandings or genuine problems is what I'm trying to find out.\"</p> <p>One major bone of contention is the council's requirement that all scientists must demonstrate the potential impact of their research to secure funding. While the research councils are in theory independent of politicians, this follows a strong steer from the Treasury, which wants proof of value for money. Gordon Brown's administration pushed this agenda hard and it has not been overturned by the coalition.</p> <p>Professor Christopher Moody, a leading chemist at Nottingham University, says: \"I have no problem with being accountable. But asking us to look in a crystal ball and say what the impact of this will be in 50 years' time is just not sensible. I worry about how much weight is put on the actual quality of the science proposal versus the statements of national importance and economic impact.\"</p> <p>Barrett is more outspoken: \"The EPSRC's obsession with impact will lead to funding things that are mediocre and incremental because you can't accurately predict the outcome of fundamental research. Either that or it will lead to some scientists simply telling lies.\"</p> <p>Golby counters: \"We are spending just short of \u00a31bn of taxpayers' money every year and we do have a duty to ensure that we are delivering value to the UK.\" However, he is quick to concede that the council should not have a one-size-fits-all policy. \"The impact agenda should be nuanced and obviously you wouldn't want a blue-skies researcher to be as precise about impact as an engineer nearer the applied end.\"</p> <p>There are other anxieties, including the slicing of PhD student provision from all research grants, and a ban on resubmission of rejected proposals even if they were deemed to be excellent.</p> <p>Barrett admits that he has come under fire from others in the community who think scientists must stand as a united force to justify more funding from government. But he insists that the EPSRC's opponents will not back down. \"We believe mediocrity is being encouraged and the country has to pay attention,\" he says firmly.</p> <p>Nurse is determined that politicians should be kept out of all this. \"They want us to sort it out ourselves,\" he says. Yet with emotions running high, sorting it out does not look easy, and some key academic figures say Golby has an almost impossible job on his hands.</p> <p>Yet he remains positive. \"I am not hoping this will all just go away,\" he says. \"Healthy debate is a good thing and we shouldn't always agree with each other. But I want the debate to be carried out in a calm fashion that helps us to support the very best of British science and keep the UK world-leading.\"</p>",
  "<p>David Bowie turned down the offer to sign off Sunday night's Olympic Games closing ceremony with a performance of Heroes, one of several high-profile acts who passed up the chance to perform in front of a global TV audience of hundreds of millions at the finale of London 2012.</p> <p>Organisers of the \u00a315m show had also hoped to persuade the Rolling Stones, Kate Bush and the Sex Pistols to appear in what was intended to be a history of British music. Even the Who, who did close the Games with a medley ending with My Generation, turned down the request to play twice, according to industry sources. But a decision by the band to announce a US tour in July swayed them, given the scale of the promotional opportunity.</p> <p>The three-hour show featuring Elbow, Take That and another Spice Girls reunion was watched by an average of 23.2m viewers, making it marginally more popular than the \u00a327m opening ceremony two weeks earlier. Viewing peaked at 26.3m on the night, although the event, which garnered a more mixed reception than Danny Boyle's show, would have been helped by its Sunday night slot, when people are more likely to be at home.</p> <p>As for Bowie, the 65-year-old has not toured since 2006, and it was always an ambitious request to try to persuade him to participate, even if Heroes was used as an unofficial anthem for Team GB during the Games. Although he closely monitors his own press coverage, Bowie, now based in New York, repeatedly turns down requests to perform or appear in public.</p> <p>Fans of the singer had to make do with a segment in the middle of the \"Symphony for British Music\" in which Fashion was played against a catwalk sequence featuring Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell \u2013 one of several recorded sections which suggested that hoped-for performers would not appear.</p> <p>Six months ago, artist managers and other music industry executives were given a presentation by concert producer Kim Gavin and film composer David Arnold of ambitious plans to showcase the history of British pop music from the 1960s. At that stage, there were few confirmed participants other than an agreement to play John Lennon's Imagine, which formed a centrepiece of the programme.</p> <p>Kate Bush was among those Gavin and Arnold hoped would appear, and there were rumours in the industry that she had agreed to perform. However, Bush too is reluctant to appear in public. Organisers agreed to play a remix of Running Up That Hill, and the singer released a statement on her website on Monday praising a \"brilliant show\".</p> <p>Backstage on the night, there was surprise that George Michael was allowed to perform his new single, White Light, which was released on Monday , in addition to solo classic Freedom. Island Records, his record company, hastily deleted a tweet inviting viewers to buy the song and the single did not make the top 10 on iTunes on Monday.</p> <p>One manager keen to support the event was Simon Fuller, the impresario behind the Spice Girls, David Beckham and Andy Murray. Some of the Spice Girls were particularly reluctant to perform at an event that despite all its apparent expense was still felt to be staged at minimal cost, but Fuller persuaded them, helpfully keeping the quintet in the public eye a few months ahead of the opening of the musical Viva Forever, which is based on their songs.</p> <p>Fuller, who was in the royal box on Sunday night, also saw another of his acts, singer Annie Lennox, perform Little Bird. But there was little sign of his rival svengali, Simon Cowell, with only one X Factor act, One Direction, performing at the event.</p> <p>HMV said it expected sales of music by John Lennon, the Spice Girls and Elbow \u2013 who performed One Day Like This \u2013 to soar by up to seven-fold this week. A compilation of the night's music, A Symphony for British Music, went to number two on the iTunes album chart, behind Now That's What I Call Music! 82.</p>",
  "<p>There is something about the character of Lord's and the personality of Andrew Strauss that seems to make them suited to one another. This is not just the natural association of a Middlesex player brought up in the professional ranks there and whose familiarity might be taken for granted as a result. He just fits it like a glove. Five of his 21 Test hundreds have been scored there, only one fewer than the record for the ground held jointly by Graham Gooch and Michael Vaughan, past England captains both, and the same, not without its irony, as his direct predecessor as captain, Kevin Pietersen.</p> <p>Perhaps it is first impressions that one remembers as defining the person. In May 2004 Strauss made his England debut at Lord's, against New Zealand, and marked his maiden innings with a century. He might have had another in the second innings, making 83 before sacrificing himself (naively the old stagers felt) as the hapless victim of a run-out involving Nasser Hussain, who went on to make a century of his own in what was to prove his valedictory innings. Eight years on, at the same time of year, this time against West Indies, he made the fifth of his Test centuries on the ground at a time when his career, not for the first time, was deemed to be on the line and it was greeted with arguably the most sustained and emotional standing ovation that the old place and its ghosts can have witnessed.</p> <p>So there is something particularly apposite, a neat completion of the circle, when on Thursday, in the humming decorous atmosphere of Lord's once more, he will lead England out to play his 100th Test match, the ninth England player to reach that milestone, precisely half of which will have been as captain. It ought to be a cause for some celebration and no doubt the crowd will respond&#xa0;appropriately.</p> <p>But he and his team will head towards the match with the controversy surrounding Pietersen's absence from the squad still dominating the agenda. Questions are certain to be asked once more at his pre-Test press conference on Wednesday when it ought to be his achievements as player and leader that are being celebrated. It might be a different animal but the elephant in the room, that Pietersen announced in his YouTube video had not disappeared, is still trampling and trumpeting&#xa0;about.</p> <p>That Strauss is holding up as well as he is through all this is as great a tribute to his mental strength as any of his batting deeds. In no other international sport does a player carry the executive responsibilities of a managing director. Strauss is responsible for his own performance but he has more far-reaching responsibilities towards the performances of the other players in his side. This, in itself, is onerous, even with the back-up he has.</p> <p>Being captain while the Pietersen saga has been playing out, however, must have been mentally draining even to one so resilient. Clearly the issue has led to a dressing room in which the unity of purpose \u2013 that which makes the best teams greater than the sum of their parts, something that has characterised this England side for the past few years \u2013 has been fractured.</p> <p>However, it is still likely that there will be a palpable sense of relief from his players when they meet. The dressing-room mood will lift. At least by the time the match starts, the issue will have been put on the back burner and Strauss himself can concentrate on winning a match, one of the most important he will have played in his career, that will determine their world status.</p> <p>When it is done, though, the spectre of Pietersen will still be there, either a problem yet to be solved or one that has been resolved in all aspects other than his reintegration into the team environment. And here, in the latter, the headaches would start again. This time the traffic is not just one way. Pietersen is right when he says that the one thing he and his erstwhile team-mates have in common is cricket.</p> <p>It is not a given that everyone has to get on, or like one another, but there has to be a common purpose which means a level of tolerance. Throughout, Pietersen appears not to have been in receipt of the best advice and it has upset those within the team. In returning now he would be treading on eggshells. But there are those within the team who would also need to show a little more understanding.</p>",
  "<p>BP has sold its Californian oil refinery to US firm Tesoro as part of a $38bn selling&#xa0;spree following the Gulf of Mexico disaster.</p> <p>The British oil group sold the Carson refinery, south of Los Angeles, along with its 800 dealer-operated petrol stations across southern California, Arizona and Nevada for $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) in cash.</p> <p>The sale brings the divestments made by BP 2010 to $26.5bn. It said it was on track to achieve $38bn of asset sales by the end of next year.</p> <p>BP has been selling off non-core assets since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

BP maintains that it has \"turned the corner\", but its second-quarter figures disappointed the City with a 35% drop in underlying profits to $3.7bn.</p> <p>BP has become a takeover target in the wake of the costly disaster, which has damaged its reputation and finances. The disposals have made it a \"much smaller meal\" to digest, according to Louise Cooper, analyst at City broker BGC Partners \u2013 it is \"no longer a 10-course feast\".</p> <p>The business remains under the cloud of the 2010 spill, as it is yet to reach a settlement with the US department of justice. In addition, BP is locked in a dispute with its partners in the Russian TNK-BP venture, which makes up a 10th of group profits.</p> <p>As part of the refinery deal, BP is also selling storage and distribution assets, including more than 100 miles of pipeline and several marine, land storage and product marketing terminals.</p> <p>New owner Tesoro will keep on the majority of the 1,700 staff at the refinery, petrol stations and other assets, although there could be some redundancies, said BP, which put Carson and Texas City refineries \u2013 two of its five in the US \u2013 up for sale in February 2011.</p> <p>Carson produces 266,000 barrels a day. Texas City, which remains unsold turns 470,000 barrels into petrol and jet fuel but does not have the distribution network and other assets that Carson has.</p> <p>Iain Conn, chief executive of BP's global refining and marketing business, described the deal as a \"significant step in the strategic refocusing of [BP's] US fuels business\". He added: \"Together with the intended sale of Texas City, this will allow us to focus BP's operations and investments exclusively on our three northern US refineries and their large and important marketing businesses.\"</p> <p>The company is close to completing a multibillion dollar upgrade at its Whiting refinery in north-west Indiana, and is also upgrading at Cherry Point in north-west Washington to produce cleaner burning diesel fuel, as well as investing in a cleaner fuel project at its joint-venture near Toledo in Ohio.</p> <p>The Carson deal is expected to close by the middle of next year.</p>",
  "<p>The burning of America's corn belt in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/13/us-federal-aid-farmers-food-prices\" title=\"\">worst drought in half a century</a> is bad news for the world's poor, bad news for food security, bad news for inflation and bad news for the policymakers trying to nurse the global economy back to health. Central bankers and finance ministers have been crying out for something unexpectedly positive to happen that would make their job easier: as it is, the threat of a disastrous US harvest is simply the latest in a series of negative shocks.</p> <p>Poor countries, where food makes up a larger chunk of family budgets, will be hardest hit by a third food crisis in five years. The World Bank is already on alert for an increase in hunger and malnutrition; previous spikes in food prices also led to widespread social unrest. Wheat and maize prices have both soared in the past couple of months by more than 40%; stocks of maize, in particular, are already dangerously low.</p> <p>This comes at a time when demand for food is rising. Population growth and rising incomes in the bigger emerging market economies \u2013 China, India and Brazil \u2013 was already a cause for concern even before the US drought, but the price spike in recent weeks has underlined the growing pressures on the global supply chain.</p> <p>Research by the Overseas Development Institute shows that meat consumption in China has quadrupled since the economic reform programme began in 1978, but is still below European levels of 80kg a year per head. It takes 7kg of maize to produce 1kg of beef, and if Chinese levels of meat consumption were to rise from their current levels of 50kg a head per year to the 80kg a year average in Europe, maize exports would need to double. The World Bank says demand for food will double between now a 2030.</p> <p>The City believes Tuesday's cost of living figures for the UK will show a small fall, from 2.4% to 2.3%, and the Bank of England expressed confidence last week that it would take time for the \"modest\" impact of rising global food prices to be felt. It may be the case that the weakness of the economy will keep inflation under downward pressure, but dearer food and more expensive petrol (the price of Brent crude hit $115 a barrel for the first time in three months on Monday) will maintain the squeeze on consumer incomes, further delaying recovery.</p>",
  "<p>The Royal Court in London will stage verbatim readings of testimony given by members of Pussy Riot in their trial on the morning the verdict is due to be delivered.</p> <p>Proposed by the playwright EV Crowe, the event will be part of a global day of action called for by the families and defence lawyers of the three bandmates, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Maria Alekhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich.</p> <p>The women were arrested in March over a protest at a Moscow cathedral against the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred.

  "<p>There is a unique opportunity right now for business to play a more influential role in shaping a curriculum in England that better reflects the needs of business, society and the environment alongside the rights of children.</p> <p>The English curriculum review is in full swing. Led by Michael Gove, we now have draft versions for primary level English, maths and science, with more on the way later this year.</p> <p>An important, but sadly well-hidden document lies in the depths of the Department of Education's website, the <a href=\"https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/eOrderingDownload/NCR-Expert%20Panel%20Report.pdf\" title=\"\">Framework for the National Curriculum</a>. This report, by an independent expert panel, provided fundamental advice to the government on the conception of the purpose, shape, size and structure of the curriculum. In other words, a strategic framework for education, from which everything else could hang \u2013 teacher training, performance testing, the school environment, and of course, the curriculum itself.</p> <p>The expert review was widely welcomed and contained five overriding aims. The final two related to child wellbeing and sustainability:</p> <p>1. Support personal development and empowerment so that each pupil is able to develop as a healthy, balanced and self-confident individual and fulfil their educational potential.</p> <p>2. Promote understanding of sustainability in the stewardship of resources locally, nationally and globally.</p> <p>Both aims appear critical for the development of creativity, leadership and innovation for society and our economy during a time of transition and increasing environmental limits.</p> <p>So the big question on everyone's mind is: will the government support these aims or dismiss them amid the \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jan/20/national-curriculum-review-facts-and-vital-knowledge\" title=\"\">back to basics\" philosophy and approach</a> to reform by the Department of Education so far?</p> <p>The good news is that <a href=\"http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/pdf/l/secretary%20of%20state%20letter%20to%20tim%20oates%20regarding%20the%20national%20curriculum%20review%2011%20june%202012.pdf\" title=\"\">in the letter from Michael Gove to Tim Oates</a>, the chair of the expert panel, the government admits \"we should define the aims of the curriculum\". However, what these aims should be is far from clear. Furthermore, many insider indications suggest the wellbeing of pupils and the stewardship of our environment may not make the final cut.</p> <p>Third sector organisations such as <a href=\"http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/\" title=\"\">Keep Britain Tidy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wastewatch.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Waste Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/ecoschools/\" title=\"\">Eco-Schools</a> have been advocating for the inclusion of wellbeing and sustainable development within the curriculum. Now it is the turn of business to also support this call.</p> <p>So what is the business case? Let's start with wellbeing. Evidence shows that happier employees are also more productive, take less sick days and are more likely to stay and develop within an organisation. So what makes employees happy? The common response is to incentivise (or bribe \u2013 depending on how you see it) through money and perks. However, there is an emerging line of thinking that suggests money matters less to people and instead, having a fulfilling role from which employees can recognise how what they do contributes towards the organisational strategy is far more effective. Having the time to continuously develop within each role is also important as is the working environment itself, just like the learning environment at school.</p> <p>Early years matter more than any other period of our development. Evidence shows that supporting the wellbeing of children supports the potential for achievement through schooling. For example, when Jamie Oliver improved the health standards of school dinners in Greenwich, <a href=\"http://cess-wb.nuff.ox.ac.uk/downloads/schoolmeals.pdf\" title=\"\">academic performance at the schools improved</a>. Young people achieve academically when they are well, emotionally and physically, they develop, then emerge from their education with the key skills and competencies that are vital to driving forward research, innovation and the success of business across the UK.</p> <p>The second point is sustainability. Adopting sustainability as an overriding aim of the curriculum will support young people to learn through academic subjects about real local and global challenges, and how to think more systemically in order to solve them.</p> <p>Many major businesses today are fully aware of natural resource constraints, climate change and complex social and economic consequences that lie ahead. They recognise that business will look vastly different in the future, even if they are not exactly sure how different yet. Some like Unilever, Marks &amp; Spencer and PepsiCo are preparing for the transition. They are exploring new ways of working based on a fundamental belief that sustainability will not just reduce their environmental and social impacts, but that it will also enable competitive business opportunities in the future.</p> <p>This transition currently manifests itself as a series of slow incremental changes. What is not clear is how and whether this transition will be achieved to the scale required.</p> <p>Children and young people growing up and attending school today will become the business leaders of the future, people who will have to tackle environmental and social issues on a level that is currently unrecognised or at least swept under the carpet.</p> <p>It is a huge challenge but one that other nations are addressing and one that our current government needs to square up to. Sustainability has to start at a young age. For it to occur, the people leading sustainability need to be well in order to solve the challenges that ultimately threaten our own and each other's wellbeing.</p> <p><em>Tim Burns is head of </em><a href=\"http://www.wastewatch.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Waste Watch</em></a><em>, a programme within the </em><a href=\"http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Keep Britain Tidy</em></a><em> charity which aims to help people to waste less and live more.

  "<p>If you were to lock a group of pop culture junkies and TV addicts in a bunker, tell them that the end of the world had arrived and that they had to preserve culture for posterity by writing books, what they would produce would be fan fiction (fanfic). This is actually the plot of a piece of fanfic from the 1950s, in which sci-fi fans survive Armageddon and rebuild civilisation in their own image. It may seem like a joke, but for many the rise of fanfic is \"the end of the world\". Fanfic is seen as the lowest point we've reached in the history of culture \u2013 it's crass, sycophantic, celebrity-obsessed, naive, badly written, derivative, consumerist, unoriginal \u2013 anti-original. From this perspective it's a disaster when a work of fanfic becomes the world's number one bestseller and kickstarts a global trend.</p> <p>As we all know, Fifty Shades of Grey, originated as a piece of fanfic based on the Twilight series. <a href=\"http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/lifeandtimes/fifty-shades-erotic-romance-now-a-global-hit/536171\" title=\"\">Since it hit 31 million sales in 37 countries</a> worried voices are asking: is this the beginning of an era in which fanfic overthrows original creation?</p> <p>It's tempting to get caught up in paradigm-shift apocalypticism, but a closer inspection reveals that fanfic is not new at all. There have been phases, fads, peaks and controversies throughout its history and it displays an incredibly diverse range of sub-genres. There's crossover, AU, Hentai, OoC, Uber, Mary Sue, slash fic, hate fic, anti fic and even wing fic (in which familiar characters sprout wings and discover their new beauty through acts of mid-air coitus). So where did this terrifying range of forms begin? And is Fifty Shades really a threat to culture?</p> <p>It's time to learn some of the jargon that fans use to describe their fic.</p> <h2>Folklore fanfic</h2> <p>If one sees fanfic as \"the work of amateurs retelling existing stories\", then one would have to conclude that the number one book in the middle ages \u2013 the Bible \u2013 was a work of fanfic, as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were non-professionals retelling the same story about the same character. However, such a definition of fanfic is skewed historically. There were no fans in the middle ages, and there were also no authors.</p> <p>If we see fanfic as \"the reworking of another author's characters\" then this form really only appears for the first time in history with the invention of legal authorship in the 18th century through copyright and intellectual property laws, after the invention of the printing press. After all, you can't have derivative works or copies if there are no regulations over what constitutes original works, or separates ownership from theft. Predating this change, with the exception of educated men of letters and Christian scholars, the populace experienced stories only through the aural folklore tradition. Such tales were re-tellings and re-makings of the same stories over generations \u2013 this was a manuscript culture in which texts were open to intervention and were not fixed. Nobody owned them and they were based on stock characters \u2013 The rake, the temptress, the Stephron and the Phyllis (Shepherd &amp; Shepherdess), the priest, the devil, the good Samaritan. In England The Romance of the Rose was the paradigmatic example of the medieval form: one writer would begin the story and another would complete it. Even Shakespeare, did not own the stories in his plays. A patron would commission him to retell a story and he was paid in royalties. All stories within the medieval period were re-workings of stories about the same characters, but we could not call them fanfic as copyright law and the printing press had not yet sectioned off the professional, paid, copyright owner of original texts, from the rest of the populace, creating a subclass of fans.</p> <h2>Fifty shades of Austen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685208\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344873666355/Old-Friends-and-New-Fanci-008.jpg\" alt=\"Old Friends and New Fancies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old Friends and New Fancies \u2013\u00a0an Imaginary Sequel to the Novels of Jane Austen by Sybil Brinton</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No sooner had the novel emerged in the 18th century than popular authors such as Daniel Defoe started protesting that his work was being \"kidnapped\" and bowdlerised by amateur writers who reduced the value of his creations with inferior impersonations. Jane Austen was less concerned with such matters, basing characters like Wickham in Pride and Prejudice upon \"The Rake\" from the lore tradition. In the 20th century with developments in cheap printing techniques and distribution, Austen inspired fanzines. A cult of dedicated literary fans called themselves the Janeites and the novel Old Friends and New Fancies \u2013 an Imaginary Sequel to the Novels of Jane Austen by Sybil Brinton, published in 1913 was the first published work of Austen fan fiction. This is an example of continuation fic \u2013 the creation of storylines that use the same characters but elaborate on unresolved threads within the originals to create new episodes. A century later the Jane Austen Fanfiction Index now catalogues over two hundred thousand works of Austen fanfic, while Goodreads currently lists 242 published books of fanfic derived from Austen. Titles include Vanity and Vexation and Dating Mr Darcy. A great number of Austen fanfic stories are pornographic.</p> <h2>The strange case of Sherlock &amp; Mary Sue</h2> <p>In the 1920s, fans of Conan Doyle started Sherlock Holmes societies in London and New York, at which they debated issues such as the question of whether Holmes's addiction to cocaine was beneficial to his perception or a sign of moral weakness. They also produced the Baker Street Journal, a hybrid zine, halfway between scholarly research and pure fandom and at gatherings read their own versions of stories they'd written themselves. The most notable works are examples of self-insert fic \u2013 in which the writer meets their hero. Examples include: My First Meeting with Sherlock Holmes by Ellery Queen and Sherlock Holmes in the White House by Roosevelt. Roosevelt in this case was not the then President, so this was also real person fic \u2013 in which a fan writes about politicians, sports celebrities, musicians, film stars etc, as if they are known to them \u2013 with self-insert.</p> <p>When the self-insert character is the author thinly disguised this is called Mary Sue fic. Mary Sues are usually flawless characters who outshine the famous characters they are placed beside. In 1973, one Paula Smith wrote an infamous fanzine short story: A Trekkies Tale in which the Starship Enterprise was visited by someone called Paula \u2013 a stunning woman who all the crew fell for. By the late 1980s there had been a glut of Mary Sues fictionally beaming themselves up on to the Starship Enterprise, and true fans started to view the sub-genre plots as insidious. Interestingly, by outshining the heroes Mary Sues reveal a lurking contempt on behalf of their fan writers towards the original characters.</p> <h2>The Enchanted Duplicator</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685209\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344874184719/Enchanted-fan-books-008.jpg\" alt=\"Enchanted fan books\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Original cover for The Enchanted Duplicator</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the 1930s to 50s fanfic existed almost exclusively within the sci-fi communities, in clubs such as the Futurians (1937\u20131945). A fascinating bunch, obsessed with communism and latterly fascism). Many fans from such groups, such as, Isaac Asimov, went on to become published authors, blurring the distinction between amateur fan and professional writer. In 1952, the world's first book of fanfic about fans appeared. The Enchanted Duplicator by Walt Willis and Bob Shaw was a metafiction based on Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, but which described a world populated with sci-fi fans. It chronicles the adventures of hero Jophan in \"the land of Mundane\". All of the characters in the book are renamed versions of real fans from the London SF circle of the 50s and the book was created entirely for their pleasure. The Enchanted Duplicator of the title is a mimeograph \u2013 a precursor to the photocopier and the chosen distribution medium of the fan. <a href=\"http://www.ansible.co.uk/misc/ted18.html\" title=\"\">The book concludes with Jophan's discovery of \"The Magic Mimeograph\"</a> which \"\u2026 will produce the Perfect Fanzine \u2026 and now the song of the trumpets filled the air, ringing across Trufandom to the far mountains\". This is fanfic squared and a way of life called \"fandom\".</p> <h2>Slash and K/S</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685210\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344867484684/Desert-Heat---Spock-and-K-008.jpg\" alt=\"Desert Heat \u2013 Spock and Kirk by Gayle Feyrer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Desert Heat \u2013 Spock and Kirk by Gayle Feyrer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the growth of television in the 50s fanfic spread globally. Sci-fi fanfic then morphed and its subtexts became dominant. Slash fic is sub-genre in which buddies from classic TV become gay lovers. The first slash fic novel to be published was <a href=\"http://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Ring_of_Soshern\" title=\"\">The Ring of Soshern,</a> a 105-pager by Jennifer Guttridge (1968). In it Spock and Kirk find themselves stranded on a remote, deserted planet. Spock goes into the state of \"Pon Far\": the violent \"on heat\" fever that comes to Vulcans, during which they must \"have sex or die\". To save Spock's life Kirk allows Spock to penetrate him, the two then fall in love and \"spend all their remaining days on the planet exploiting both the planet and each other's bodies\".</p> <p>The violent-sounding \"slash\" is so called because of the \"/\" separating the names of the two characters involved in homoerotic love or pornographic sex, for example Holmes/Watson, Spock/McCoy, Harry Potter/Ron, Starsky/Hutch, Jesus/Judas. Over the decades slash has also come to stand for porn of any kind, including \"Het\". Other subgenres in slash include femslash in which formerly het characters have lesbian experiences (Buffy is popular). HP femslash is Harry Potter lesbian porn; real person slash is where the writer makes love to a famous person; and, disturbingly, Chanslash is a Japanese sub-genre which involves coitus with famous characters who are underage. These two merge in <a href=\"http://www.justinbieberfanfiction.com/browse.php?type=epubbrowse\" title=\"\">Justin Bieber fanfic</a>. On one site alone there are 16,040 stories available as ebooks by 8,028 authors, which feature the child star at different ages and to degrees of eroticism. The story 1st by Cassie Chassey is a Self-insert Mary Sue Het Slash romance which includes \"emotional abuse, sexual abuse and sexual assault\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685211\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344874627441/Justin-Bieber-fan-books-008.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Bieber fan books\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1st by Cassie Chassey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a dark sexual undercurrent to the majority of fanfic, as if on a subconscious level the fan actually resents the control that their idol or idealised character has over their life. Through the act of writing fanfic, and subjecting characters to compulsive or vengeful love, sex, S&amp;M or rape, the fan then regains control.</p> <h2>James Potter and the prisoner of copyright</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685212\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344867675425/James-Potter-and-the-Hall-008.jpg\" alt=\"James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing by G Norman Lippert</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While fanfic multiplied exponentially with the invention of the internet, authors were split over what to do about it. Anne Rice, author of Interview with the Vampire vigorously defended her copyright, claiming that fanfic, in particular AU fic diluted the integrity of her characters and stories. In a letter to her fans she stated: \"I do not allow fan fiction. The characters are copyrighted. It upsets me terribly to even think about fan fiction with my characters. It is absolutely essential that you respect my wishes.\" Fanfic authors then claimed that Rice had attacked them by email and even threatened their businesses. She also demanded that FanFic.net remove all fanfic stories. Since then authors such as Andre Norton, Mercedes Lackey and David Weber have also come to adopt a zero-tolerance stance.</p> <p>Contrary to this Douglas Adams claimed that fanfic expanded his understanding of the parallel universes he'd created in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and that they increased his sales. JK Rowling also encourages fanfic. In 2003 she said she was \"flattered people wanted to write their own stories\" based on her characters. She did however stipulate one condition \u2013 that they did not try to make money from their creations. Her stance was tested when fan/author George Lippert decided to commercially release a book of Continuation fic which was Extending the Canon. <a href=\"http://wordsutteredinhaste.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/james-potter-and-hall-of-elders.html\" title=\"\">James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing</a> was based on a fictional son of Harry. Rowling threatened legal action for infringement, but after much adverse press from fans she relented and allowed the publication to go ahead.</p> <p>Fans now use disclaimers such as: \"JK Rowling owns all recognisable characters/settings/spells/etc in this fanfiction.\" And Rowling permits all fanfic under the proviso that it does not contain racism or pornography. This an entirely futile request as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3666577/How-J-K-created-a-monster.html\" title=\"\">slash HP (Harry Potter) has become one of the internet's most popular fanfic forms</a>. In it Rowling's characters are made to have sex with each other in almost infinite variations: Harry/Ginny, Ron/Hermione, Snape/Narcissa. Arthur/Molly, Molly/Hermione, Hermione/Fred&amp;George, Draco/Pansy. These have also been \"crossed-over\" with characters from other films and books, some of which are paedophilic in nature. Such quantities of posts are nearly impossible to track and monitor. Fan fiction.net has 603,410 HP fic stories.</p> <p>Rowling's launch of Pottermore online is set only to increase fan participation and produce even greater quantities of fanfic, including slash. There is even <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7237056/1/Pottermore\" title=\"\">fanfic about Pottermore</a>.</p> <h2>Crossing over and mashing up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685213\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344873149392/Darth-Vader-v-Harry-Potte-008.jpg\" alt=\"Darth Vader v Harry Potter Spongebob VS Edward & Harry Potter Spongebob VS Edward & Harry Potter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darth Vader & Spongebob VS Edward & Harry Potter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most postmodern and aesthetically bankrupt of all fanfic, is when two well-known franchises from the same genre are \"crossed over\". So you get BattleStar Gallactica, crossed with Star Trek, which results in the story: <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8316852/1/Star_Trek_Way_of_the_Battlestar\" title=\"\">Star Trek: Way of the Battlestar</a> \u2013 author Carson Napier.</p> <p>One of the problems with this sub-genre is that narratives and character motivations have to be warped to fit convoluted, meaningless mergings. This is taken to absurd lengths with YouTube \"films\" like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXnPG19npW8\" title=\"\">Battlestar Galactica Vs Star Wars Vs Star Trek Vs Babylon 5</a>. Crossover has now become mainstream through such projects as Aliens Vs Predator which exists as cartoons, computer games, movies, a TV series and a series of novels. Crossover also jumps genres so Edward from Twilight ends up in Hogwarts, Bella ends up in ER and the characters of The X-Files clash with those of Breaking Dawn.</p> <p>While much credit has been given to mashup author Seth Grahame-Smith for \"unleashing a whole new genre\", with mashup, the truth is that the mashup technique behind Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, was developed decades before within fanfic. The aesthetic innovation that elevates mashup fic above Crossover fic is the deliberate clash of incompatible genres in a way which is deconstructive or at least humorous, as in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.</p> <p>Much mashup fanfic however simply creates an incomprehensible mess. See <a href=\"http://m.fanfiction.net/s/7398721/2/\" title=\"\">A Very Potter Sitcom, season 2!</a> In which Dumbledore appears in Legally Blonde the Musical and the <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6880805/1/Triwizard_Mash_Up\" title=\"\">Triwizard mashup</a> in which fans vote for fight stories to be written between characters such as Godzilla, Gandalf, Darth Vader and Spongebob Squarepants. This also results in meaningless second gen multiples like Darth Vader &amp; Spongebob VS Edward &amp; Harry Potter. Fanfic sites also post narratives of impossible meetings (usually sexual) between improbable characters \u2013 Captain Jean-Luc Picard has sex with Elrond from Lord of the Rings. Indiana Jones has sex with Voldemort \u2013 this is mashup slash. As no new plot or characters are being created, then all that can happen is the multiplication of crossover interactions and partners, and an attendant increase in sexual imagery and violence. There are literally millions of fanfic stories in which sex and humiliation (fuelled no doubt by fan boredom) are the only possible outcome of such contrived and meaningless confrontations.</p> <h2>Alternative Twilight universes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394685214\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344867365887/Master-of-the-Universe-by-006.jpg\" alt=\"Master of the Universe by Snowqueens Icedragon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Master of the Universe by Snowqueens Icedragon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the 90s AU has dominated. AU fic (alternative universe) features stories which are based on \"what-ifs\", which deviate from the original novels or films. So there's \"What if Darcy was blind\" or \"What if (in Twilight) Bella is engaged, to Jasper, not Edward\". The stories must deviate from the canon but still remain familiar. There are currently <a href=\"http://twific.net/?p=5463\" title=\"\">over a hundred self-published Twilight AU novels</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/book/Twilight/\" title=\"\">fanfiction.net has 130,137 predominantly AU narratives</a> which include: Edward and Bella meeting in kindergarten; Edward as a teacher, Bella as a student (with motorbike action); Jacob and Edward as gay lovers; Bella and Alice in love; Edward is an Angel; Bella is the vampire and Edward is the human; Bella is a millionaire and Edward is a professional thief; Edward is a tattoo artist; Bella is on the Titanic; Bella is going to commit suicide when sexy teacher Cullen saves the day; Bella owns a Pizza place called Pizza and Porn; Edward and Bella set in the 1800s (a rape fantasy). On this site 66,606 of the stories are rated M, for 18+. <a href=\"http://www.themarysue.com/50-shades-of-grey-and-the-twilight-pro-fic-phenomenon\" title=\"\">As one leading fanfic site claims, \"the majority of Twilight fanfic is porn\"</a>. Many of these stories will sound spookily familiar. In one: His Personal Assistant (2009), \"Bella Swan, personal assistant to handsome, rich, successful Edward Cullen, decides to make oblivious boss fall in love with her\"; in another (2009) \"Edward is a millionaire obsessed with Isobella Swan\". One, <a href=\"http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4764216/1/The_Submissive\" title=\"\">The Submissive by Tara Me Sue</a>, is described as \"37 chapters of juicy graphic detail\", \"Think Story of O meets Twilight minus the vampire stuff\". This story, which can be found on fanfiction.net, like the others above, predates the publication of Fifty Shades by two years and was not written by EL James.</p> <h2>50,000 shades of lore</h2> <p>Fifty Shades series grew out of a multi-part series of Twilight fanfic called Master of the Universe. It placed the Bella and Edward love affair in an alternative universe, in contemporary Seattle and changed their names: Bella = Anastasia, Edward = Christian Grey.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thepassivevoice.com/05/2012/fifty-shades-a-copy-of-twilight-or-not/\" title=\"\">Although the author then tried to erase evidence of its fanfic origins</a>, it's clear that rather than being some lightning bolt new genre called \"Mommy porn\", Fifty Shades is actually a very generic work of Twilight fanfic from amongst tens of thousands already created. It is, in fact, a piece of \"AU het slash Twilight fic\", and as we've seen, in all slash fic, sex and sexual violence are the predictable components of the genre.</p> <p>We should not consider EL James an author in the conventional sense for the same reasons that we wouldn't call someone from before the invention of copyright an author. Rather, her books are like medieval lore \u2013 in a sense she doesn't own the content. This content was circulating in 60,000 variations among the fanfic of other Twilight fans for years before she even created the books. Like a gambling machine with a limited number of options for recombination, the story was going to eventually be spat out as a win for somebody. This isn't an example of plagiarism but a return to an earlier notion of collective creation. Fifty Shades is a book with 60,000 authors.</p> <p>The only innovation is not in the story itself but in the delivery system that launched it \u2013 Amazon KDP. Without Kindle the book(s) would never have escaped the gravitational pull of fanfic sites and would not have been able to earn their author any money. KDP, has become the Enchanted Duplicator that has monetised fanfic and propelled it into the market. The historic difference, the point we have just crossed, is that now, through the mechanism of epub, fanfic is heading towards becoming the cultural dominant. The much-hyped \"next Fifty Shades\", <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10140661-gabriel-s-inferno\" title=\"\">Gabriel's Inferno</a>, also started life as Twilight fanfic, and the fact that Penguin hunted it down from fanfic sites and paid a \"seven-figure\" sum, marks the transition where the market turns upside down, and mainstream content is created by fans.</p> <p>Beyond that, as we have seen with other fanfic, Fifty Shades has launched a spate of impersonations, pastiches, parodies, homages and rip-offs. Like the Enchanted Duplicator, this is fanfic based on fanfic. Currently on Amazon there are 641 quickly made ebooks tagged under \"Fifty Shades\". They fall into the hate fic, insert fic, crossover fic and continuation fic categories and include: Fifty Shades of Earl Grey, Fifty Shades of Garbage, Fifty Shades of Bacon Flavoured Vagina Spray, Fifty Shades of Grey and Zombies, Fifty Shades of Pink, of Green, of Gay, of Alice in Wonderland, of Twilight. Finally with Fifty Shades being developed by Universal Pictures the phenomenon comes full circle. If any of the stars of Twilight the Movie appear in <a href=\"http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/11794851-popular-twilight-fan-fiction-fifty-shades-of-grey-becoming-a-movie\" title=\"\">Fifty Shades the Movie</a>, then the serpent will have devoured its tail.</p> <p>So what happens to culture when fanfic becomes the dominant economic model in publishing and the leader in cultural values \u2013 is that even possible? Surely derivative works have to be derived from something \"original\". With Fifty Shades this ceases to be the case, and, as we have seen, fanfic offers many tools for recycling (AU, crossover, mashup, self-insert, Mary Sue, the 12 varieties of slash etc) which takes the recombination of texts into the exponential. It is possible that with the enchanted duplication systems of fan-based epub, we might have arrived at a point in history where we've accumulated enough cultural material from the past for fans to remix indefinitely, and as they can now sell this content to each other this becomes a boom industry where none existed before. However, the point where fans become the creators, and a derivative work becomes the new original is also the point at which the culture industries stop needing to create anything new. Fanfic begets fanfic, which then in turn becomes mainstream which then begets further fanfic and so on. When we reach that point our future will not be fifty, but fifty thousand, shades of grey.</p> <p>\u2022 Ewan Morrison's fifth book Close Your Eyes is published by Jonathan Cape.

  "<p>President Barack Obama moved to stem the impact of the worst drought in 50 years as he directed the department of agriculture to buy up to $170m of pork, lamb, chicken and catfish.</p> <p>The move comes as the G20 group of countries are reportedly planning their response to drought and soaring food prices around the world. The US is the world's largest exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat and the drought has already sent prices to record levels.</p> <p>Obama made the announcement on Monday at the start of his three-day trip to Iowa, a swing state the Democrats hope to win in this November's election. The state that has been hit hard by a drought that last week drove US corn prices to an all-time high.</p> <p>The farming crisis is emerging as a key battleground in the 2012 election. The president is trying to pass a farm bill through Congress that he claims will aid farmers but has been stalled by Republicans over what they see as excessive costs.</p> <p>Pressure for action intensified last week as the US department of agriculture (USDA) warned food prices were set to soar. USDA said the worst drought in 50 years had forced farmers to abandon corn fields covering an area larger area than Belgium and Luxembourg combined. The department slashed its forecasts for key crops including corn and soybeans and lowered production forecast for eggs, milk and pork. Blaming \"extreme and dryness\" in the Central Plains and the Corn Belt, the USDA said it now expects this year's corn harvest to be the lowest since 1995-1996.</p> <p>The food Obama intends the purchase will go toward \"food nutrition assistance\" programmes, like food banks. Obama also intends to push the department of defense to speed up purchases and said it was a good time to buy \"while prices are low, and freeze it for later\".</p> <p>\"Right now folks here in Iowa and across the heartland are suffering from one of the worst droughts in 50 years,\" he said. \"Farmers and ranchers depend on a good crop season to pay the bills and put a roof over their heads, and I know that things are tough right now.\"</p> <p>Obama is under pressure to drop laws that mandate the amount of corn ethanol that must be produced each year. This year 13.2bn gallons of corn ethanol will be mixed with gasoline to meet the federal renewable-fuel standards. Its production will require about 40% of this year's crop.</p> <p>Livestock farmers blame the mandate for driving up corn prices. Governors in Maryland and Delaware, two poultry-growing states, have called on Obama to ease the size of the mandate.</p> <p>Last week the United Nations released a report that said world food prices had increased by 6% in July, driven up by a 23% spike in corn prices. Oxfam called for urgent action and said the price rise threatened a return to the crisis of 2008 when similar price hikes triggered riots around the world as the United Nations said a billion people were going hungry.</p> <p>\"This drought, combined with bad policies like ethanol mandates, has put the world's poor on a collision course with a food crisis,\" said Eric Munoz, senior policy advisor for Oxfam America.</p> <p>The impact of the world's poor and on the fragile global economy are likely to be major topics under discussion by the G20 later this month. G20 officials plan to hold a conference at the end of August and set a meeting for late September or early October, according to the Financial Times.</p> <p>In a report to investors Fidelity warned that the rise in agricultural commodity prices \"could not be occurring at a worse time for the global economy with the eurozone sovereign debt crisis still in full flow, China slowing down and the US outlook looking increasingly uncertain. The biggest direct negative effect of higher food prices is on consumers, particularly in emerging markets. As consumers are forced to spend more on food items, discretionary spending is reduced in other areas, creating negative knock-on demand effects for other industries.\"</p>",

But it is not always recognised or recorded on death certificates, which is in part why it has not been effectively addressed.</p> <p>Britain said it would back <a href=\"http://www.cgiar.org/\" title=\"\">research into creating drought-resistant and vitamin-enriched crops</a> that could help feed 45 million people for a year in Asia and Africa, as well supporting the development of nutrition-rich seeds and tubers to benefit 3 million people in African and India. The private sector will play a role, with companies such as Unilever, Syngenta and GSK working to find ways to make nutritious food available to poor families at affordable prices.</p> <p>It is estimated that long-term exposure to a poor and inadequate diet and repeated infections have left 170 million children in the world suffering from stunting, a condition that stops children's bodies from growing and developing properly.</p> <p>The hunger summit, co-hosted by Michel Temer, Brazil's vice-president, and attended by Mo Farah, the double Olympic champion, was born out of the G8 summit in the US in May, when President Barack Obama announced a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/fact-sheet-g-8-action-food-security-and-nutrition\" title=\"\">food security initiative with African leaders and the private sector</a>. British NGOs, particularly <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/\" title=\"\">One</a> and <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a>, wanted to maintain the momentum on tackling hunger and particularly nutrition. Given that Britain takes over the G8 presidency next year, while Ireland assumes the presidency of the EU, it was felt that David Cameron and <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0812/irish-eu-presidency-will-push-hunger-prevention.html\" title=\"\">Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, who attended the hunger summit</a>, would be ideally placed to keep hunger on the international agenda.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/09/johnson-sirleaf-yudhoyono-cameron-development\" title=\"\">Cameron has also been appointed to a UN high-level panel</a> to consider what should follow the millennium development goals (MDGs), which are set to expire in 2015, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/07/nigerian-indonesian-officials-post-busan-panel\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell, the international development secretary, is on another high-level panel on development effectiveness</a>.</p> <p>\"Cameron has a real opportunity to shape the agenda by 2015,\" said Molly Kinder, One's director for agriculture and Europe policy.</p> <p>Kinder said she was impressed by the level of substance that came out of the hunger summit, and particularly by the EU's specific pledge to take responsibility for reducing the number of stunted children in the world by 7 million by 2025.</p> <p>\"The UK is very results-focused, the EU less so, [so] it signals a strong commitment from the EU,\" she said.</p> <p>Kinder added that India's decision to double its budget for improving the health and nutrition of 100 million women and children was also encouraging.</p> <p>\"India is the elephant in the room, a low-level performer in nutrition despite its strong economic growth,\" she said.</p> <p>Other campaigners welcomed the high-level focus on global hunger, but said more fundamental change was needed. War on Want pointed to evidence from its recent <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/overseas-work/17394-food-sovereignty-report\" title=\"\">food sovereignty report</a> that sustainable farming under the alternative framework of agroecology \u2013 which minimises external inputs, such as fertilisers \u2013 has proved its worth in tackling both hunger and environmental degradation.</p> <p>\"The real issue is that the global food system is set up to allow for the maximum control of big agricultural companies like Cargill,\" said executive director John Hilary. \"As long as enormous control of the food system lies within the hands of companies, power is removed from small farmers.\"</p> <p>Hilary argued that China and Brazil made strides in reducing hunger and helped move the world towards the MDGs by returning power to smallholder farmers.</p> <p>\"Where it's happened, we've seen massive gains,\" he said. \"In Brazil, hunger was reduced following a huge increase in family farming and the resettlement of the homeless on land. China in the 1980s built a post-Mao settlement by returning power to small farmers and rural communities.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/06/sam-dryden-global-south-agriculture\" title=\"\">Sam Dryden, the Gates Foundation's head of agriculture</a>, who attended the hunger summit, acknowledged the pressure of large corporations \u2013 as well as agricultural subsidies in the west \u2013 in squeezing out smallholder farmers in Africa.</p> <p>\"If you let them [large corporations] dictate what gets grown, that can happen,\" he said. \"Agriculture is a local experience, eating is a local experience. It is important that African countries develop their own systems and that smallholder farmers grow the crops they want to grow.\"</p>",
  "<h2>SINGH WHEN YOU'RE WINNING</h2> <p>Shebby Singh is Blackeye Rovers' \"global adviser\". Repeat: global adviser. You may well wonder why Rovers should be putting so much effort into global affairs when recent evidence suggests they can't even figure out what to do on their own pitch, and that would be a pretty decent question from the Fiver's point of view. The playing surface at Ewood Park, at 115x76 yards, represents a little over one thousand millionth of one per cent of the world's surface area. That is to say, a very tiny minority of the entirety of what Shebby Singh is advising them about. And he can't even get that right.</p> <p>Still, at least there's mathematics. Discussing the forthcoming season with a few hundred supporters at Blakey's Cafe Bar in King George's Hall on Saturday, Singh concluded that Rovers manager, Steve Kean-out, would \"definitely\" be sacked if the season starts poorly. \"For me, it's about results. For me, after three games if we dropped nine points, we would quite literally only have a 50% chance of getting promoted,\" he declared. For the Fiver, after three games if they dropped nine points, they would quite literally have almost exactly the same chance of going up as they did at the beginning. They would still have another 129 points to play for. Relax a little.</p> <p>Then there was the recently transfer-listed Morten Gamst Pedersen. Singh pronounced that he had \"lost his legs\", was \"past his sell-by date\" and was \"quite literally of no use\". This is a player the club is currently trying to sell for the maximum possible fee. In terms of advertising, he seems more of the Ratner &amp; Ruin school than Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. And matters got worse when his remarks were reported in the Lancashire Telegraph. Had the Fiver been present we would have found it impossible to resist quizzing Singh on Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as running mate, or the forthcoming changes to the line-up of popular Antipodean-based pre-school pop outfit the Wiggles, or the forest fires smouldering in Spain. He is, after all, a global adviser, and should be on top of these things.</p> <p>But this morning he had his own fires to put out. After all, the manager was furious and the players were too, and so Singh was forced to \"sincerely\" apologise to Kean and Pedersen. \"Some things are said in jest that don't come across like that when repeated,\" he said. So he was joking. Not wildly funny, but OK. He's no comedian. He's apologised. Singh then added: \"My blunt honesty sometimes upsets people and sometimes rubs people up the wrong way.\" So he wasn't joking. He was being bluntly honest. The man can't even apologise convincingly.</p> <p>What's clear is that Singh, for all the many great qualities the Fiver has no doubt he offers to Blackeye Rovers, needs someone to advise him from time to time. But who advises a global adviser? Expect the position of universal advisor to be advertised soon. Possibly not in the Lancashire Telegraph.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY No1</h2> <p><strong>8 January 2011:</strong> \"I was going to call him a sewer rat, but that might insult the sewer rats.

  "<h2><strong>1 The Brownlee brothers take gold and bronze</strong></h2> <p>In the weeks before these Games, the West Yorkshire brothers Alistair and Jonny Brownlee dreamed of crossing the line together in the triathlon, though they knew the Olympic rules prevented such a finish. As it turned out they both found a way to triumph. When Jonny, the younger brother, was hit with a 15-second penalty on a technicality in his changeover between the swimming and cycling it seemed his chance of a medal was gone. His brother had other ideas. Leading from the front Alistair set out at a brutal pace on the first two laps of the 10k run around the Serpentine, stretching the field and carrying only his brother and the world champion Javier G\u00f3mez with him. The tactic, which the brothers had discussed during the cycle ride, established for the breakaway trio a 30sec lead over the rest of the field, and allowed Jonny to take his penalty and still win bronze, while Alistair strode out magnificently for gold. Watching on, it seemed the closest sport has ever got to a \"two little boys had two little toys\" moment. Tear-jerking brilliance. <strong>Tim Adams</strong></p> <h2><strong>2 Wojdan Shaherkani takes to the mat</strong></h2> <p>My personal highlight was probably, in pure sporting terms, the least worthy moment of London 2012. Saudi Arabia's Wojdan Shaherkani has achieved only a blue belt in judo and it was probably thanks solely to sportsmanlike politesse that she was allowed to stay on her feet for 82 seconds before being floored by her opponent in the women's 78kg contest. As she left the mat, she did not even know which way to bow. But if it was negligible as a contest, as an act of courage it was heart-stirringly impressive \u2013 a 16-year-old girl who has never before been permitted to compete internationally, defying the hateful abuse she has received and daring to become the first woman from her country to take part in the Games. Her appearance in London was never going to win her anything but who knows, it may just inspire others to do something so shockingly transgressive as to participate in sport. <strong>Esther Addley</strong></p> <h2><strong>3 Ruta Meilutyte shocks the world</strong></h2> <p>It was day three in the Aquatics Centre and the big fish of US swimming, Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte had been circling each other. The pool had yet to come to life but on to the deck strode a little-known 15-year-old from Lithuania in a green swim cap. Ruta Meilutyte hit the front in the 100m breaststroke and her last 25m brimmed with the confidence of a youngster never having tried and failed. She pushed to go faster and surged to gold. Grinning wildly, Meilutyte perched on the lane rope and lifted her arms wide to the 17,000 roaring fans in the steeply raked wings of seating. It was a gesture that crackled with realisation of what she had achieved despite or perhaps because of her youth and in that electrifying moment the champion and the crowd connected. <strong>Robert Booth</strong></p> <h2><strong>4 Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps go head to head</strong></h2> <p>The single best race I saw was David Rudisha's record-breaking run in the 800m final, with Mo Farah's victory in the 5,000m just behind. But I'm going to pick the first Thursday night in the pool, when Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps fought for the title of the greatest all-round swimmer at the Games. Both swam twice on the night, and each had about 30 minutes to recover between races. Lochte finished third in the 200m backstroke and then got blitzed by Phelps in the 200m individual medley. Phelps staggered on to the podium, so tired he had to lean against the wall to stop himself falling down, then got back in the pool and destroyed the field in his 100m butterfly semi-final, finishing in the fifth-fastest time in history \u2013 he was a lot slower when he won the final the next night. He swam with a touch of the old anger that always used to fuel him, as if to say \"you think I'm washed up? Watch this\". He has no peers. Everyone else was swimming for second. A furious Phelps is one the finest sights in sport and this was the last great evening for the greatest Olympian. <strong>Andy Bull</strong></p> <h2><strong>5 Team GB baffle the cycling world</strong></h2> <p>Cycling offered many favourite moments: Bradley Wiggins speeding past Luis Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez in the time trial, the women's pursuit team closing on the Americans in the final, Laura Trott's utter mastery of the elimination, the tears of Chris Hoy. But Olympic winning is the norm for GB cyclists. What was unique was when the silver medallist Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9 took over the post-race press conference to quiz the newly crowned sprint champion Jason Kenny about how he did it. The Frenchman's conclusion: \"You will play possum until Rio, then \u2026 bam.\" As a summary of the opposition's complete lack of answers in the velodrome, it could not be bettered. <strong>William Fotheringham</strong></p> <h2><strong>6 Mo Farah's 10,000m triumph</strong></h2> <p>The first time I entered the Park to be greeted by witty, smiling volunteers and professional, charming soldiers was a big moment \u2013 you realised this was going to work after all. But amid a ludicrously crowded field, the first half of Mo Farah's historic double edges it as a standout sporting memory. You can ladle all the meaning on to it you like \u2013 and the sight and sound of middle England collectively losing its marbles for a Somali-born, west London-raised man of the people was something to behold \u2013 but at its core this was simply an imperious sporting feat. No British man had won the event and there had not been a non-African winner since 1984. Farah tore up the rulebook, working with his American training partner, Galen Rupp, to deal with each surge as it came, refusing to panic and striking for home with supreme confidence at 600m as the noise reached wild levels. The wall of sound in that intimate yet imposing bowl contained a note of disbelief, as if a crowd who had only just seen Jessica Ennis cross the line and Greg Rutherford jump to an unlikely gold could not believe what they were seeing. By the time Farah crossed the line to cap 47 minutes that will go down in British sporting history, there was barely a dry eye in the Olympic Stadium. Unfinished Sympathy, the Massive Attack song that was playing as Farah charged round his final lap, will never sound the same again. <strong>Owen Gibson</strong></p> <h2><strong>7 David Rudisha's 800m world record</strong></h2> <p>Few sporting achievements have left me genuinely gobsmacked but David Rudisha's victory in the 800m was one, even before all those privileged enough to witness it realised he had taken one tenth of a second off his own world record and acknowledged the feat with one of the loudest, most gutteral stadium roars I have ever heard. Such was the Kenyan's self-confidence he thought nothing of gambling the farm on breaking his record, bringing the best out of his beaten opponents in the process. So much so that Andrew Osagie's last-place finish was one of the stellar British performances of the Games. <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong></p> <h2><strong>8 Beth Tweddle's brilliant bronze</strong></h2> <p>So many highlights. Mo, double Mo, Jessica, Super Saturday, the terrier-whippet Brownlee brothers, the Caribbean stall in the Olympic Park, the myriad of flowers in the wetlands, anything in the velodrome, the tenacious British handballers and weightlifters who never stood a chance but gave it their all, Michael Phelps's final individual race, the astonishing 15 and 16-year-old gold-winning girl swimmers from China and America, Tom Daley coming good, so many wheelchairs in a city in which the disabled are all too often invisible. But best of all was Beth Tweddle's retirement bronze \u2013 ethereal grace, true grit and the hands of a navvy. My mum always loved Beth and now I know why. <strong>Simon Hattenstone</strong></p> <h2><strong>9 Nicola Adams and Katie Taylor box to gold</strong></h2> <p>Yes, the Olympic Stadium on successive Saturday nights, amid the fluttering union flags and much of the 80,000 crowd singing the national anthem \u2013 think Last Night of the Proms on steroids \u2013 was something else. But while no one will forget the Jess, Greg and Mo show, or the sequel a week later, for history on a truly epic scale you had to had to be at the ExceL on Thursday for the women's boxing finals. By some wonderful alchemy the Irish fans had turned a few hundred tickets into several thousand and for two hours they stomped and clapped and ol\u00e9-d. British supporters caught the mood, especially while <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicola-adams\" title=\"\">the Guardian columnist Nicola Adams</a> was bamboozling the world champion Ren Cancan to become the first women's Olympic boxing champion in history. When Katie Taylor, Ireland's golden girl, joined her about 15 minutes later the volume shot off the scale, especially when the MC announced: \"Ladies and gentleman, the winner by a score of 10 points to 8, and Olympic champion \u2013 Katie \u2026\" The rest was drowned out by exultant hosannas. The best atmosphere of the Games, bar none. <strong>Sean Ingle</strong></p> <h2><strong>10 Tumbleweed in the ExCeL</strong></h2> <p>At the ExCeL the seven-sport cocktail blurred into a ceaseless \"happening\" so there are two, related incidents. The privilege of the job is variety, so doorstepping the Kyrgyzstan wrestler Aisuluu Tynybekova as she moved through the mixed zone after her first-round loss was an experience. After confidently yelling \"Aisuluu\" she finally stopped and, understandably, waited for the question. With no Kyrgyzstani or Russian personnel present a tumbleweed moment of Pinteresque silence followed, then she walked off. The second moment came the next day when this parish's esteemed rugby correspondent questioned a line in the report of Tynybekova's 63kg bout that stated fermented horse milk is Kyrgyzstan's national drink. \"How do you actually milk a horse?\" came the quite reasonable query. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <h2><strong>11 Beth Tweddle's uneven bars routine</strong></h2> <p>It was 12 years since Tweddle had begun her gymnastics career. In that time she had won everything \u2013 European, Commonwealth and world titles \u2013 but an Olympic medal. Despite being almost a decade past prime gymnast age, and beset by serious injuries, she had kept training and competing because a fourth place at Beijing had left her heartbroken. In qualifying, her belief-defying uneven bars routine made seasoned professionals gasp \u2013 and everyone knew that if she could just repeat it in the final, she would fulfil her dream. She did, and for the first time on a podium, the true stoic of her sport shed a quiet tear. <strong>Emma John </strong></p> <h2><strong>12 GB women's handball team v Angola</strong></h2> <p>Did they win? No. Was it close? Not even nearly. Did they try? By God, yes. The British women's handball team may not have landed a medal, or much troubled the leviathan nations of their sport, but in their Copper Box match against the world No8 team Angola, the rookie crew showed more heart, ferocity and sheer giddy joy in taking part in the Olympics than many other teams. The narrow 31-25 score line was a testament to their energy and determination, and, hopefully, a sign of greater things to come. As their coach, Jesper Holmris, said: \"If we're competitive now with only four or five years of practice, and starting totally from scratch, then of course there's a really good future for handball in Britain.\" Fingers crossed. <strong>Sam Jones</strong></p> <h2><strong>13 Jessica Ennis wins the heptathlon</strong></h2> <p>Looking back, it all began with Jessica Ennis. It was the 2012 poster girl, somehow shaking off the weight of public expectation, who got British athletics off to an incredible start that first morning in the Olympic stadium. Roared along by the crowd, the first time we felt the magic of their combined 80,000 strong voices, she gave us a sensational performance in the 100m hurdles: 12.54sec, so good it had Britain's team captain, Dai Greene, doing a double-take of the clock. The time alone put the 26-year-old in the history books \u2013 fast enough to have won gold in the individual event at all bar two Olympic Games. The pure anticipation, knowing that Ennis would go on, break more records, was spine tingling. The following evening, under an East London night sky, Britain's golden girl started the gold rush \u2013 the whoops and the tears \u2013 and then the lingering questions: did this really happen? Or were we all just dreaming? <strong>Anna Kessel</strong></p> <h2><strong>14 Jade Jones's taekwondo gold</strong></h2> <p>Picking a solitary highlight risks overlooking the sheer brilliance of Danny Boyle's opening ceremony, the inspiring deeds of Team GB's cyclists, rowers, riders and the feelgood buzz of the Games as a whole. Perhaps the best snapshot, though, was Jade \"The Headhunter\" Jones's helmet-hurling gold in the taekwondo; fearless British female excellence was the Games's constantly recurring storyline. That photo of Wiggo posing next to the \"Modfather\" Paul Weller (separated at birth?) was great, too. <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p> <h2><strong>15 Chad le Clos steals Michael Phelps's thunder</strong></h2> <p>One of Michael Phelps's greatest triumphs as an Olympian was entwined with a loss in a discipline in which he was meant to be indestructible. In the 200m butterfly final Phelps won his 18th medal \u2013 so equaling the Olympic record \u2013 but a twist was buried inside a moment that was meant to be swathed in glory. The event that had belonged to him for over a decade ended in defeat and a silver medal when South Africa's Chad le Clos produced a blistering finish that just beat Phelps to the wall. That conclusion defined the exhilaration and pathos of sport. Bert le Clos, Chad's burly dad, then gave us the most entertaining interview of the London Olympics. <strong>Donald McRae</strong></p> <h2><strong>16 The opening ceremony</strong></h2> <p>These things are, without exception, awful. Except somehow this one wasn't. At the start of these fearfully anticipated Games it seemed almost enough that London had managed to get though this appalling game of global party charades not just unembarrassed but looking oddly and defiantly happy with itself after Danny Boyle's baroque and unapologetically intelligent left-leaning British history primer. In fact the only hole in Boyle's vision of Albion was perhaps a refusal to acknowledge the plastic rubbish that infests much of modern British life. Where was the cringe-making tat, the gurning mediocrity? On the other hand the creation of a giant looming Voldemort/David Cameron (yes, Boyle: we noticed) menacing the saintly NHS with his scythe more than made up for it. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> <h2><strong>17 Murray finally wins at Wimbledon</strong></h2> <p>Got to be Henry's Hug. When the 11-year-old Henry Caplan, eyes welling up, rushed through the seats on Centre Court at Wimbledon to hug Andy Murray after he'd beaten Roger Federer to win the gold medal, sport went from theatre to humanity. Henry told his startled father he \"had to go\". It was a spontaneous gesture that captured the emotion of the moment and told us something about the changing relationship between Murray and tennis fans who have taken a little while to warm to him. If a small boy from Essex can embrace the Scot, surely the rest of the country can too. Even south of the border. <strong>Kevin Mitchell</strong></p> <h2><strong>18 Ben Ainslie's gold medal</strong></h2> <p>Ben Ainslie was simply magnificent. He trailed Jonas Hogh-Christensen throughout the preliminary 10-race series and looked beaten in the medal race. Somehow he clawed back the Dane's lead and in the final race got ahead and stayed ahead to become the most successful Olympic sailor of all time. He was skilful but it was his steely determination to win that was most impressive. He willed his way to that fourth gold. And 70,000 people turned out on the beaches, cliffs and Weymouth's stone pier to roar him home. He wasn't on great form; he shouldn't really have won it. But, somehow, you always knew he would. <strong>Steven Morris</strong></p> <h2><strong>19 GB win team showjumping gold</strong></h2> <p>I spent much of the Olympic fortnight among the horsey folk at Greenwich Park, where the arena surely offered the best views in London. I had excursions to the bizarre beach volleyball, the refined fencing and to Wimbledon, where I saw Roger Federer's epic semi-final win over Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro and then Andy Murray's demolition of the great man himself. In sporting terms, the latter must win. But in human terms, the best moment came in the team showjumping, where Britain pipped the Netherlands for gold. The Dutch should have won really \u2013 the final rider, the individual silver medallist Gerco Schr\u00f6der, just had to ride a clear round to nail it, something that was well within his compass. But he had a fence down, the contest went to a jump-off and the rest is hysteria. I would have been bereft but immediately after the jump-off I was standing next to the unsaddling arena as the British celebrated. \"That was good sport,\" one of the Dutch riders called across. I thought that was a brilliant response. \"A silver won rather than a gold lost,\" they insisted. And they meant it. <strong>Stephen Moss</strong></p> <h2><strong>20 Laura Trott goes wild for Chris Hoy</strong></h2> <p>On Super Tuesday in the velodrome I was among a scrum quizzing the new omnium gold medallist, Laura Trott, as just in front of us, Sir Chris Hoy raced in his keirin final. She politely kept talking till the crowd noise made it obvious the finish was imminent. On seeing Hoy zip across the line first Trott jumped in the air, screamed as loud as she could, danced an improvised jig, hugged a British official and went straight back into answering some anodyne question I'd just put to her. Amazing moment, and a lovely woman. <strong>Peter Walker</strong></p> <h2><strong>21 Yohan Blake runs the bend</strong></h2> <p>It was tucked away in a relay race \u2013 albeit a final that was run in a world record time \u2013 but Yohan Blake's third leg of the men's 4x100m was the best piece of bend running I have ever seen. Taking the baton from Michael Frater, he was matched against Tyson Gay, the second fastest man of all time. His legs working at a phenomenally high cadence, he reached a velocity that seemed to challenge the laws of centrifugal force and clocked a time of 9.0sec. After that, all Usain Bolt had to do was grab the stick and be himself. <strong>Richard Williams</strong></p> <h2><strong>22 Bradley Wiggins wows the time trial</strong></h2> <p>The complications of a time trial means that, quite often, at the end, you're watching hundredths of a second flick past on a giant screen instead of the riders: or if you are watching the riders, it's quite hard to work out if they've won \u2013 so there's often a split-second of perplexity. That was the moment of the London games, as the information sunk in, that Bradley Wiggins had won an Olympic gold in the same year as winning the Tour de France, and Chris Froome had got a bronze, that the home disadvantage had been overcome, all this dawning under an unexpected burst of sunlight. <strong>Zoe Williams</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2012. The original said that Ruta Meilutyte hit the front in the 100m backstroke rather than breaststroke. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The lemon was almost too big for Vincenzo Crescenzo's grimy palm. With his nails, he scratched the fruit's bumpy skin until the white pith showed through.</p> <p>\"Smell that,\" he said, as a pungent aroma infused the steamy air of the orchard. It was 9am and Crescenzo had finished work for the day. At this time of year, he begins at five and continues \"until the heat becomes too great\".</p> <p>Crescenzo started working in the lemon groves of the Amalfi coast when he was 10. Apart from military service, and a spell as a migrant worker in Switzerland, he has worked in them ever since, growing the <em>sfusato</em> lemon \u2013&#xa0;so-called because, with its pointed ends, it looks much like a spindle, a <em>fuso</em> in Italian.</p> <p>The orchard, owned by a Roman, is tiny: five terraces with about 150 trees set into a precipitous hillside that falls away to the glittering Bay of Salerno. In a few days, Crescenzo will begin to harvest.</p> <p>This summer, he can expect around 50 cents (39p) a kilo \u2013 a big improvement on last year. Even so, the harvest will not yield a profit. \"The owner has had this orchard for 15 years and she's never once got back her costs,\" he said.</p> <p>For 73-year-old Crescenzo too, lemon-growing is something of a hobby. Like most of the others who work the orchards above Cetara, he is a pensioner. \"Young people don't go into this job,\" he said. \"They can't make any money.\"</p> <p>Behind him was one reason why: the ferry from Palermo, lazily gouging an arc of backwash through the azure surface of the bay. The route from Sicily is called the \"sea motorway\". It offers truckers an inexpensive way to shorten their journey to the markets of central and northern Italy. Many of the lorries aboard were no doubt carrying lemons far cheaper to grow than a <em>sfusato</em>.</p> <p>Along the coast in Maiori, Carlo de Riso, manager of the area's main sorting and packing plant, describes the growing of this gourmet's delight as \"heroic agriculture\". The lemons are brought down to his plant on the backs of labourers, each carrying a bag containing 57kg of fruit.</p> <p>Quixotic might be a better description than heroic, were it not that the <em>sfusato </em>brings with it a vital guarantee. \"The lemon farmers here are the sentinels of the environment,\" said Angelo Amato, vice-president of the consortium for the protection of the Amalfi coast lemon.</p> <p>With its steep cliffs, the coast is susceptible to landslides. The roots of the lemon trees help to stabilise the ground, and the dry stone walls of the terraces also play a crucial role.</p> <p>\"They are made so that the rainwater which is needed stays, while the rest drains away,\" said Mario Tozzi, a researcher at the National Research Council (CNR).</p> <p>The last deadly landslide was two years ago. But there are fears that, if the lemon groves disappear along with their mostly elderly cultivators, the area could see a major disaster like the landslides that killed 161 people in the nearby inland town of Sarno in 1998.</p> <p>\"There are some similarities,\" said Tozzi. \"The old woods above Sarno had been replaced by hazelnut trees with shallow roots.\"</p> <p>Several attempts have been made to give the <em>sfusato</em> a future. The 1990s saw the limoncello liqueur, which nowadays absorbs about 10% of the crop.</p> <p>True Amalfi coast limoncello is exquisite: airily bittersweet. But its success has led to the marketing of imitations, made either with essence or fruit that does not qualify for the protected geographical indication (PGI) the EU has conferred on Amalfi coastal lemons.</p> <p>A law was passed four years ago to give the farmers subsidies. But no funds have been found to make it effective.</p> <p>One hope for the future lies with the new, mainly young leadership of the consortium. In May, Carlo de Riso's cousin, an internationally renowned pastry chef, Sal De Riso, was chosen as&#xa0;president.</p> <p>\"I use 5,000kg of lemons a year,\" he said at his little factory, high in the mountains above the coast. De Riso said one of his aims was to put a squeeze on big firms which make <em>panettone</em> and use&#xa0;minute quantities of the Amalfi coast's lemons so they can put the PGI emblem on their packaging. They were being asked to include a minimum proportion and pay a fee to use the symbol, he said.</p> <p>The consortium is also working with the CNR to find uses for the huge number of lemons that are discarded. For every 10kg that reach the market, 16-18kg are picked. The leftovers could go into juices, ice cream and even beauty products.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, said Amato, the future depended on making the business more efficient and drawing in younger people. \"With modern irrigation equipment and a minimum of between 7,000 and 10,000 sq metres of land, you can turn a profit,\" he said.</p> <p>Of late, lemon-growing on the Amalfi coast has received a boost from an unlikely source. \"The economic crisis is bringing people back to the land,\" said De Riso. \"We even have lawyers and engineers who have returned to work the orchards belonging to their families\".</p>",
  "<p>In the past few years, political leaders have suffered decisive failures at advancing the sustainability agenda during their gatherings in Copenhagen, Johannesburg and Rio. Even cautiously lowered expectations have not been met. George Monbiot <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/25/rio-governments-will-not-save-planet\" title=\"\">described </a> Rio+20 as \"the&#xa0;greatest failure of collective leadership since the first world war \u2026 the end of the multilateral effort to protect the biosphere.\"</p> <p>There have been many divergent reflections on the reasons for such immense failure. However, we see signs of a new consensus about how to shape the future. The vacuum left by the absence of political leadership has generated a groundswell of support for collaborative, multi-sectoral processes focused on modest initiatives.</p> <p>Mary Robinson <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/26/world/americas/rio20-mary-robinson-failure/index.html?hpt=hp_c3\" title=\"\">expressed her deepest regrets</a> about the inaction of political leaders at Rio+20: \"This possibility of a once in a generation moment passed us by.\" In her view, the only way forward to a sustainable society is through civil organising.</p> <p>Peter Bakker of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/rio-20-business-sustainable-development/print\" title=\"\">reacted with a sense of anger and urgency</a>. \"I don't want self-satisfaction, which I saw at the corporate leaders forum in Rio, or people bringing me stories of CSR achievements.</p> <p>\"The truth is if you add up all the CSR programmes across the world and all the 200-plus commitments from this week, we are not nearly going to save the world.\" Bakker feels that it is past time for the best business leaders to take on the challenges, work locally across sectors and push for better reporting and more accountability.</p> <p>At a recent appearance in Oxford at Resource 2012, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18837028\" title=\"\">Bill Clinton laid the blame</a> for these political failures on the ignorance of voters. At the conference he said: \"The whole consciousness of a significant number of voters\" must be changed to allow their governments to address resource scarcity. This brings to mind Juncker's curse: \"We all know what to do, we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it.\" Clinton then articulated his view of a multi-sectoral strategy. For Clinton, the way forward is not more conferences with braver politicians; it lies in the ability of governments, businesses and NGOs to work together.</p> <p>Although these three leaders lay the blame for the failure of Rio+20 in different places, we see a recurrent theme in their visions of the way forward.</p> <p>First, sustainability must now be advanced through collaborations among multiple business sectors, levels of government and NGOs. Politicians no longer lead the process, but work with those who can identify issues and propose solutions. It is in the skills and methods of civil society that we can move our agenda forward, says Robinson.</p> <p>Secondly, through many small, local and achievable projects, we can make gains. Clinton identified the same kinds of projects the <a href=\"http://www.skollfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Skoll Foundation</a> and others have been developing for years: energy retrofits, solar installations, cleaner fuels. Bakker wants to see local cross-sectoral initiatives in cities.</p> <p>Thirdly, there must be measurable goals and a new mechanism for accountability. No longer is conventional CSR reporting adequate to the task. New accounting methods, as Rio's <a href=\"http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/\" title=\"\">Declaration on Natural Capital</a> begins to define, must be put in place.</p> <p>Perhaps in all these nascent strategies, we see the ghost of Nobel prizewinner <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom\" title=\"\">Elinor Ostrom</a>, who died as the conference began. On that day, <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/print/green-from-the-grassroots\" title=\"\">she published her last column</a> on sustainability. \"Setting goals can overcome inertia,\" she wrote. \"But everyone must have a stake in establishing them: countries, states, cities, organisations, companies, and people everywhere. Success will hinge on developing many overlapping policies to achieve the goals.\"</p> <p>With the collapse of intergovernmental and global processes, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we now must use new mechanisms that bring businesses and communities together. For these to succeed, we need new ways to define and measure our goals and achievements. Saving the planet is no longer the work of political leaders, but an opportunity for managers, CEOs, accountants and activists to devise collaborative solutions.</p> <p><em>Roger Martin is dean of the University of Toronto's </em><a href=\"http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/\" title=\"\"><em>Rotman School of Management</em></a><em> and is academic director of the school's </em><a href=\"http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/lee-chininstitute/\" title=\"\"><em>Michael Lee-Chin Family Institute for Corporate Citizenship</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Are radical feminist separatists infiltrating Saudi Arabia's ruling elite? Have the women of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia undergone a wild revolution, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/30/women-gayrights\" title=\"\">read Love Your Enemy? and decided to eschew all male company</a> to create their own political systems and free themselves from the patriarchy? I hope so, because otherwise it's hard to imagine the convoluted logic behind a decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/saudi-arabia-city-women-workers?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">build all-female cities</a> to boost women's employment.</p> <p>The country already has separate schools, segregated universities (and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/27/saudi-arabia-university-for-women\" title=\"\">biggest all-female university in the world</a>) not to mention offices, restaurants and even <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/12fac18e-e160-11e1-839a-00144feab49a.html\" title=\"\">separate entrances for public buildings</a>. Now industrial hubs are to be built so that women can be hidden away even further than their current dresscode of abaya, headscarf and niqab allows.</p> <p>The country's segregation is so extreme the plans bring to mind the US's racial divide under the Jim Crow laws, ensuring \"separate but equal\" institutions for black and white people. And like the legalised discrimination in the US, \"equal\" in this context means no such thing. The female half of the adult population of Saudi Arabia is considered unfit to control their own lives. Women cannot decide whether to leave the house, whether or who to marry, whether to work or study, whether to travel, what to wear, or even whether to have major surgery \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/26/saudi-arabia-women-equal-rights\" title=\"\">without the consent of a male guardian</a>.</p> <p>In a country of such startling misogyny, which treats women like children, it is hardly surprising there are few women in work and that it is becoming a crises the ruling elite is being forced to take notice of. Almost <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/29/saudi-women-living-contradiction\" title=\"\">60% of the country's college graduates are women</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/06/11/220016.html\" title=\"\">78% of female university graduates are apparently unemployed</a> \u2013 despite the fact more than 1,000 hold a doctorate degree. In total only 15% of Saudi Arabia's workforce are women. And unlike in many recession-hit countries, there are more than enough jobs to go around \u2013 the economy apparently booming.</p> <p>Yet with women refused driving licences for fear it will lead to social disintegration, education for girls failing to fit them for the workplace, and businesswomen still expected to have a male representative to deal with government agencies, not to mention the pressure to provide women with separate offices, employers naturally favour men. With sexism so central to the system, women are also largely restricted to traditionally female-oriented fields in the public sector and less than 1% of decision-making posts are held by Saudi women.</p> <p>With so many barriers and a climate that seems hostile to women working \u2013 or being in the public eye at all \u2013 many female employers and employees will no doubt welcome the chance to find jobs and not have to cope with the difficulties of a mixed-sex environment. The industrial cities are said to be places that will improve women's prospects and give them the chance for greater financial independence. The first is planned to open next year, and will apparently create 5,000 jobs in textiles, pharmaceuticals and food-processing industries, with four similar industrial cities being proposed in Riyadh.</p> <p>But how can further segregation be expected to solve the problems caused by discrimination? It takes a peculiar leap of logic to think the answer is instead to build whole new cities where women who choose to have careers can be herded. Would this be seen as acceptable, even progressive, if the cities were there to house workplaces for people of one race rather than one gender? But where are the voices calling for an end to the country's discriminatory practices? There has been none of the broad support that would have ensued had the segregation been along race lines. In South Africa such segregation was the basis for a worldwide boycott, yet Saudi Arabia is merely seen as an \"exceptional\" place with a different culture.</p> <p>Clerics will say that Islam does not allow women and men to mix at work, while the rulers explain that segregation is part of Saudi culture. Yet Islamic feminists have pointed out time and time again, that the prophet Muhammad himself was married to a businesswoman \u2013 with no need to hide in an all-women city. A culture that does not just segregate women, but enshrines in law that they are second-class citizens is hardly one worth preserving.</p> <p>If the cities fail, it will, no doubt, be seen as a sign women are not fit to run businesses. But if they turn out to be a success, more will be built, and women will be more segregated than ever \u2013 disappearing even further from the public sphere. So maybe the answer is for women to not just welcome the cities, but flock to them, close the doors, and refuse to leave until the kingdom's rulers understand just what it is like to live without women.</p>",
  "<p>Is it all over yet? I must confess that I fell asleep several times during Sunday night's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/12/london-2012-closing-ceremony-pictures\" title=\"\">Olympic closing ceremony</a>, which went on a bit too long. At various points I became convinced that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/olympic-games-closing-ceremony-culture\" title=\"\">great pagan pop festival</a> was about to end. But no, Rio's carnival crew popped up to give us a taster for 2016 (I think they'll manage) and the final speeches gave way to Take That or The Who. Was that Darcey Bussell? What was she doing there with the old rockers?</p> <p>But I'm falling into a familiar trap: carping about a creatively chaotic conclusion to a magnificently well organised and enjoyable global celebration, which Britain hosted in great style. I can only find one half-hearted whinge (is it a record?) in today's coverage in the Daily Mail (two if you count the \"What was druggie Kate Moss doing there?\" article). Moss-bashing is a Mail campaign.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/01/britain-olympic-gold-moaning\" title=\"\">complained about this </a>six weeks ago when the gloomsters were working themselves up into a lather about everything going wrong. In the event only G4S, the private sector security contractor, really screwed up, only to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/24/london-2012-olympics-g4s-military\" title=\"\">the armed forces step in</a> and become the unplanned hit of the Games.</p> <p>As usual, most of the cynics and miserablists turned out to be closet sentimentalists who went overboard in the opposite direction once they spotted they'd backed the wrong horse this time. So I was both appalled and impressed that <a href=\"http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2012/08/if-you-believe-that-olympic-glory-makes-a-nation-great-just-remember-the-ussr.html\" title=\"\">Mail on Sunday columnist, Peter (brother of Christopher) Hitchens</a>, was willing to appear on Radio 4's Today on Monday morning to denounce the closing ceremony as a \"moronic inferno\".</p> <p>What's more, said Hitchens, it was proof that the Christian monarchy we used to inhabit has been overthrown by what I think he called \"New Labour totalitarianism\", underpinned by pop music. Reactionaries always think this way, the decline from past glory is a form of romanticism, though they mistake it for realism.</p> <p>Hitchens's Larkin-esque tirade includes you, Boris and Dave: Hitchens says you're both enslaved by the New Labour zeitgeist and that George Osborne calls Tony Blair \"The Master\". Incidentally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/politicians-success-london-olympics\" title=\"\">Blair was annoying in his own way</a> on the same Radio 4 show, but has the merit of being cheerful. His interpretation of the message of the London Games was that modern Britain is about diversity within common and shared core values.</p> <p>Let's hope he's right, since there's no visible alternative. The hard task now as we return to the day job, complete with hangover recession and the rest, is realistically to assess how best the feel-good legacy of the Games can be exploited for the common good \u2013 from urban regeneration to healthier kids and revitalised tourism \u2013 without going completely barking in the opposite direction of Peter Hitchens in proclaiming a new Britain has been born this past 16 days, or that an old one has been re-born.</p> <p>I'll serve up Tory MEP Dan Hannan's, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2184689/Multiculturalism-Nonsense-The-Olympics-victory-patriotism-common-British-values.html\" title=\"\">blowhard article in last week's Mail, </a>which asserted that Team GB's triumph and the nation's mood were not vindications of multiculturalism or New Labour collectivism, but of the competitive spirit and deeply held voluntary traditions.</p> <p>It's no worse than many others of the genre. Desperate Dan \u2013 whom I love to tease as \"Peruvian-born Dan\" during his uber-patriotic outbursts \u2013 makes some good points, though claiming that the Games vindicate Norman Tebbit's famous \"cricket test\" is stretching it a bit. But the other side has good points to make, too.</p> <p>As Martin Ivens fairly explained in the Sunday Times, \"the Tories have a guilty past\", those 10,000 playing fields sold off under Maggie and Major, that vital funding and PE targets recently slashed by Michael Gove. Like most of life's endeavours, achievement is usually a mixture of co-operation and competition. Was it not Isaac Newton who said \"If I have seen further than other men it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants\", in much the same way that athletes have paced each other and generously praised each other in victory and defeat these past two weeks?</p> <p>If Premier League footballers, foul-mouthed, over-paid louts that too many of them are, can capture half the spirit in the coming season we will all be better off. It is not true that \"nice guys finish last\". If it was, our footballers really would be world beaters.</p> <p>The awkward fact is that, just as Labour once sanctioned a lot of nonsense about the unhealthy nature of competition (those of us never picked for the team get the point, though it's wrong), so many conservatives kid themselves that it's all about liberating people from the burdensome state. The state is there to protect and nurture. It is all about proper boundaries.</p> <p>I heard usually risk-averse Mitt Romney's new running mate, Paul Ryan, banging on about the wicked state last night. That should scare floating American voters. Obama may not be a great president, but he is a lucky one. It was Jess Ennis who thrived in Sheffield's publicly funded sports facilities, the gracious Ennis too who gently told an interviewer that young athletes shouldn't be forced to compete too young.</p> <p>So the politicians will use their autumn conference speeches to claim that the London Olympics vindicate their own vision of 21st-century Britain; they will make both valid claims and dud ones. We need not listen to them too hard. Mo Farah is more fun to listen too and more gracious. He also seems very smart. Nice guys sometimes do surmount setbacks and come first. Not many, alas, but enough to cheer us all up at the prospect.</p> <p>In summary, just that may be the real legacy of the London Games: a surge of enjoyable happiness, which has embraced some people who had expected to be indifferent. Even without the Bank of England's Eeyore, Mervyn King, (silver medalist to Peter Hitchens's gold?), warning everyone that the halo effect may not do much for the economy, history suggests the economic benefit is likely to be modest.</p> <p>We can't be sure. David Cameron's upbeat prediction may be right after all. But there's a lot to be said for a cheering-up in hard times, even an expensive one like this. It's been the biggest mood-changer since the Falklands war (also costly) in 1982, a retired general told the Times letters column today.</p> <p>That's an interesting comparison, a reminder that this country seems to pull the stops out and perform really well when its back is against the wall. So it's good to see a nation (four nations if you prefer) looking at ease with itself and be reminded that the things which unite us remain powerful and generous in spirit on occasion.</p> <p>Me, I love the idea of the golden post boxes being repainted in Olympiads' neighbourhoods. Daft but nice. Back in the real world the economy is still flat-lining and the bills must be paid, Syria is still bleeding, the polar ice cap is melting faster than we feared and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2187422/A-bride-41-John-Cleese-72--years-marriage-No-3-ended-12m-divorce.html\" title=\"\">John Cleese has just remarried </a>for the fourth time. As the nights draw in and queues return to Heathrow, it's surely best to remember Mo's beam. Those golden post boxes should help.</p>",
  "<p>As the puffed-out chests of many of its inhabitants demonstrates, Great Britain is feeling rather smug about the Olympics. But how has the sporting extravaganza been seen around the world?</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p>Still reeling from a poor performance that saw them come only 10th in the medal table, Australia nonetheless gave London 2012 a large thumbs-up. At least one Aussie risked being ostracised by suggesting London may even have gone one better than Sydney in 2000. \"These Olympics had Sydney's vibrancy, Athens's panache, Beijing's efficiency, and added British know-how and drollery,\" wrote Greg Baum, in the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/olympics/news-london-2012/the-verdict-its-been-a-right-bangup-job-20120812-242we.html#ixzz23PvfIPBq\" title=\"\">Sydney Morning Herald</a>. \"With apologies to Sydney, they might just represent a new PB [personal best] for the Olympics.\"</p> <h2>China</h2> <p>The enthusiasm for London 2012 was a little more muted in Bejing, the 2008 hosts. In a poll on <a href=\"http://www.huanqiu.com/\" title=\"\">huanqiu.com</a> \u2013 the website of the populist state-run tabloid Global Times \u2013 95% of respondents thought Jacques Rogge wrong to praise London 2012 as happy and glorious. There is continuing anger at the badminton debacle that saw one Chinese pair and three from other nations disqualified. \"Judges had double standards and made themselves look very unprofessional,\" one commenter wrote below the poll results. \"And the tickets were shockingly expensive. The worst Olympics ever! From this Olympics, we see the fall of the [English] gentleman.\"</p> <p>In a similar poll on <a href=\"http://www.ifeng.com/\" title=\"\">ifeng.com</a>, more than 56% of the 190,000 who voted gave a low rating to London 2012 due to poor organisation and the questionable judgment of referees, with 68% deeming the Beijing Games more successful. One user on the <a href=\"http://www.weibo.com/\" title=\"\">Sina Weibo</a> microblog said: \"London Games' has become a swear word.\"</p> <h2>US</h2> <p>There was a little more love across the Atlantic, with a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/sports/olympics/a-memorable-and-musical-olympic-closing-ceremony.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">blog by David Segal in the New York Times</a> which noted that \"the Games have hit this country like an extra-strength dose of a mood-enhancing drug\". The alarmists and detractors had little fodder, he noted. \"Even the weather played nice. This was an astoundingly seamless production, given the size of this city and the scale of the endeavour.\"</p> <p>Newspapers on the west coast hailed the Olympics as a triumph of British spectacle and innovation. \"Without getting too mushy, my take-away is always that, at heart, people want to get along and respect each other's cultures while seeing the world's best athletes do awesome stuff,\" mushed <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/mark-purdy/ci_21297430/purdy-classic-mementos-these-london-olympics?source=pkg\" title=\"\">the San Jose Mercury News</a>, singling out the volunteers for special praise. \"London made that happen again. Cheerio to all responsible. Well done.\"</p> <p>Bill Dwyre, the LA Times correspondent, said Britain had <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-oly-dwyre-closing-ceremony-20120813,0,700270.column\" title=\"\">captured the essence of the event</a>. \"Every four years, some of us who type for a living lose about three weeks of our lives to gain a lifetime of experiences. It is called the Olympic Games.\" The finale, he said, capped a magical Games. \"It is a wonderful, captivating musical show.\"</p> <h2>Israel</h2> <p>The Israeli press, full of anguish about the country's poor showing at the Olympics, praised London's staging of the Games. \"The London Olympics gets a high score,\" wrote Uzi Dann on the front page of the liberal daily, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/\" title=\"\">Haaretz</a>. It wasn't, he said, \"as perfectly staged as those in Beijing, but there was a much better atmosphere, a genuine carnival feeling. The athleticism was outstanding, the crowd was wonderful (even if it was overly patriotic) and the Olympics organisers were astoundingly nice, polite and obliging.\"</p> <h2>Thailand</h2> <p>In Thailand, papers focused on their country's own poor performance after athletes failed to bring home anything but silver and bronze despite winning gold medals at every Games since 1992. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, badminton silver medallist Chong Wei has been forced to apologise to Chinese rival Lin Dan over a controversial YouTube rap video in which the gold medal winner was denigrated as \"cocky\" and \"on dope\" before being warned by film-maker (and sometimes rapper) Namewee: \"I see you one time, I beat you up one time.\"</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>German commentators have marvelled in the past two weeks at the way in which the British confidence in their own identity has received a boost thanks to the Olympics.</p> <p>Gina Thomas, wrote in the <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/\" title=\"\">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a>, that \"Britons who for years have become used to their own failings have amazed themselves at the Olympic Games. In the Olympic frenzy that has captured the nation and turned cynics into a happy human throng, Britain is celebrating itself not only as a country of immigration, but after years of growing separatist tendencies, once again as a united kingdom.\"</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Despite the disappointment of Paris having lost out to London to run the 2012 games and David Cameron's stoking of cross-Channel awkwardness over fair play and false starts in the cycling, France's verdict on the running of the Olympics was an enthusiastic pat on the back. \"Extremely positive\" both in terms of \"sporting results and organisation\", said the daily <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/\" title=\"\">Lib\u00e9ration</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a> noted that Britain has as many \"whingers and professional pessimists\" as France, and these had gladly predicted doom, gloom and chaos before the start of the Games, but had been proved wrong.</p> <p>As well as new British sporting faces \u2013 and France did question whether British sport was dominated by the upper-classes (based in part on the royal equestrian presence) \u2013 Paris discovered a character they previously knew next to nothing about: Boris Johnson. \"And the winner is \u2026 Boris,\" said a headline in the <a href=\"http://www.lejdd.fr/Jo-Londres-2012/Actualite/Boris-Johnson-a-regale-les-Britanniques-des-ses-bons-mots-pendants-les-JO-542140\" title=\"\">Journal du Dimanche</a>, marvelling at a \"Viking-like\" buffoon-politician the paper felt managed to make the most out of every appearance, including his five minutes hanging from a zipwire.</p>",
  "<p>There is normally a profound disconnect between the worlds of elite sport and international development. But the past fortnight has been far from normal. For once, the Games have lived up to the rhetorical idealism synonymous with the Olympic movement: gloriously, if fleetingly, there has been an almost tangible sense of the divide between the developed and developing worlds being bridged.</p> <p>We felt it when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/08/david-rudisha-colm-oconnell-kenya\" title=\"\">David Rudisha</a>, of Kenya, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/david-rudisha-world-record-olympic-800m\" title=\"\">shattered his own world record</a> to claim an electrifying win in the men's 800m final. We felt it in the performances of Botswanan teenager Nijel Amos and Kenya's Timothy Kitum, who respectively claimed silver (Botswana's first Olympic medal of any colour) and bronze in the same race. And we felt it in the exhilarating display of talent paraded by Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba, who \u2013 fresh from winning the African Championships in only the third competitive race of her life \u2013 set a new national record in qualifying for the women's 800m final.</p> <p>Such moments matter. They demonstrate sport's power not only to transfix, but to transcend negative stereotypes and transform perceptions. To look at Kenya in development terms can prompt a focus on poverty, unemployment, political unrest, food security issues. Contemplate the country through the prism of Rudisha's performance \u2013 one of the great moments of this or any other Olympics \u2013 and you can only doff your cap to one of the world's major distance running powers.</p> <p>We also witnessed a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor countries in less obvious ways. Niger rower Hamadou Djibo Issaka might have finished last in the men's singles sculls, but you would never have guessed it from the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rowing/19112057\" title=\"\">rapturous applause he received from the predominantly British crowd at Eton Dorney</a>. No back-story was more powerful than that of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/london-2012-rwandan-mountain-biker\" title=\"\">Adrien Niyonshuti, the mountain biker</a> who lost most of his family in the 1994 Rwandan genocide . And <a href=\"http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=20313:olympics-kiprotich-saves-best-for-last-with-ugandas-first-olympic-gold-medal-in-40-years&amp;catid=78:topstories&amp;Itemid=116\" title=\"\">Stephen Kiprotich's victory in the men's marathon</a> ensured Uganda's national anthem featured at Sunday's closing ceremony, and was therefore heard around the world \u2013 a rarity for a country whose only previous Olympic gold was in 1972.</p> <p>It was likewise a good Olympics for gender equality. Neither the hijab controversy that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19046923\" title=\"\">threatened Wojdan Shaherkani's participation in the judo event</a>, nor the brevity of her stay once she got there, could overshadow the potential significance of her becoming the first Saudi Arabian woman to compete at the Olympics. Ditto Sarah Attar, the 800m runner who became the country's first female track athlete. Given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/13/olympics-2012-saudi-women\" title=\"\">cultural constraints faced by Saudi women, not least when it comes to participating in sport</a>, it was heartening to see a derogatory Arabic Twitter hashtag successfully turned around by activists to convey a more positive message. With Qatar and Brunei likewise breaking with historical precedent by fielding female athletes, it was the first Games where women have featured for every participating country.</p> <p>The caveat, as always with the Olympics, is what will change in the longer term.</p> <p>The efforts of Shaherkani and Attar will not alone have a transformative effect on gender equality in Saudi Arabia; only fundamental social, political and cultural change can achieve that. Issaka's moment in the spotlight is not going to solve <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/jun/01/niger-emergency-food-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Niger's food crisis</a>, just as Niyonsaba's burgeoning talent cannot address the issues of poverty, conflict and displacement facing Burundi. Great Britain's double gold medallist Mo Farah deserves huge credit for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/12/mo-farah-hunger-summit-downing-street\" title=\"\">urging action on child malnutrition</a>, but a long, hard road lies ahead (not that he, of all people, will be daunted).</p> <p>That's not to say sport can't effect positive long-term change. It's no coincidence that Rudisha's dash into the history books coincided with an announcement by Kenya's prime minister, Raila Odinga, that the country will bid for the 2024 Games. \"<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/09/business/kenya-2024-olympics/index.html\" title=\"\">Kenya had the confidence as far back as 1968 to consider bidding for the Olympics</a>,\" said Odinga . \"That is the spirit we need to recapture. We need to bring back that confidence and say we can do it. It is necessary to take a look back at where we are coming from and where we want to go, because we have been drifting for too long.\"</p> <p>A successful bid would mark a significant coup for Kenya, making it the first African country to host the Games. At the same time, staging a major sporting event is hardly a development panacea. South Africa perhaps discovered as much in <a href=\"http://www.leftfootforward.org/2010/07/spain-reign-but-what-impact-has-the-world-cup-left-on-south-africa/\" title=\"\">staging the 2010 football World Cup</a>, and stories are already emerging from Rio de Janeiro, host city of the 2014 tournament and the next Olympics, of poor communities being forced to make way for improved infrastructure. Similarly, while no one would deny the 2008 Beijing Olympics were a resounding success as a sporting spectacle, there is little evidence of a development legacy in areas such as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-18780003\" title=\"\">social infrastructure</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/davidbond/2012/05/beijings_monuments_to_a_lost_o.html\" title=\"\">progress on human rights</a> or <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/17/world/asia/china-beijing-air-pollution/index.html?iref=storysearch\" title=\"\">environmental change</a>.</p> <p>Nonetheless, if Nairobi were to host a successful 2024 Games \u2013 if the developing world was showcased at first hand, rather than being mediated through the displays of a clutch of athletes performing in a developed host city \u2013 attitudes might be altered in a more lasting way.</p>",
  "<p>Oil behemoth BP has sold its Carson, California oil refinery and related assets for $2.5bn cash to Tesoro Corporation, a refinery firm based in oil-hungry Texas.</p> <p>The sale is the latest move in the company's reshaping of its US business, which has taken a battering since the Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p> <p>It comes days after BP announced a similar sale of its two gas processing plants in Texas \u2013 Sunray and Hemphill \u2013 to Eagle Rock Energy Partners for $227.5m cash.</p> <p>Friday's amuse-bouche to this morning's announcement continues the company's winding down of its southern businesses and the focusing on its northern assets.</p> <p>It also wants to continue expansion into shale gas which will make the US a net exporter for the first time in decades.</p> <p>Iain Conn, chief executive of BP's global refining and marketing business, said:</p> <blockquote> Today's announcement is a significant step in the strategic refocusing of our US fuels business. <br>Together with the intended sale of Texas City, this will allow us to focus BP's operations and investments exclusively on our three northern US refineries, which are crude feedstock advantaged, and their large and important marketing businesses. </blockquote> <p>BP is planning to sell off $38bn by the end of 2013 and the running total since 2010 is now at $26.5bn.</p> <p>And while $2.5bn seems like a lot of money to put into the pot of the London-based firm, it will pale into insignificance when the company's stake in Russian venture TNK-BP is finally sold off.</p> <p>The company is very, very keen to stress (twice in as many days) that its work in the US is far from over, giving the stock market a long list of its American businesses and achievements, just in case anyone thought it was starting a long retreat after its role in the biggest oil spill in history.</p> <p>It says (among numerous other achievements) that</p> <blockquote> BP has invested more in the United States over the last five years than any other oil and gas company. <br>BP's commitment to U.S. energy security is reflected in its natural gas business, North America Gas (NAG), which is the seventh-largest producer of natural gas in the United States, with a presence in seven of the leading U.S. gas basins. </blockquote> <p>Shares were down 1.2p, 0.3%, at 447.4p.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.rss.org.uk/\">Royal Statistical Society</a> and the Datablog teamed up with four statisticians at Imperial College, London, to help us work out how key factors might change the Olympic league table. By 'weighting' the medals, what happens to the results?</p> <p>And we have a winner: Russia.</p> <p>The team, <a href=\"http://www.canagnos.com/\">Christoforos Anagnostopoulos</a>, <a href=\"http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~gmontana/\">Giovanni Montana</a>, <a href=\"http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/\">Axel Gandy</a> and <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.mortlock\">Daniel Mortlock</a>, looked at previous olympics and traditional indicators such as the output of a country's economy (GDP), the size of its population - and also ways to weight the score by the size of each country's Olympic team.</p> <p>The figures so far were based on separate rankings for GDP, population and team size. What the team has done now is combine them all into one index. </p> <p>Says Anagnostopoulos:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The more objective view which we propose here attempts to explain as well as possible the number of medals won per country on the basis of its population and GDP per capita. We employ GDP per capita rather than GDP, since we are already taking population into account in this approach. </p> </blockquote> <p>Each country is then scored based on the number of extra medals it would win if those medals were weighted according to our new ranking - this is known as a residual in statistical jargon). </p> <p>\"We propose this as a purer measure of athletic skill. For countries that underperformed, this number can be negative,\" says Anagnostopoulos.</p> <p>So, the final ranking is:</p> <p><strong>1. Russia <br>2. UK <br>3. China <br>4. Hungary <br>5. South Korea <br>6. Ukraine <br>7. Australia <br>8. Cuba <br>9. Jamaica <br>10. Belarus </strong></p> <p>In 2008, it looked like this: China, Russia, Australia, US, UK, Cuba, South Korea, Ukraine, Belarus, Kenya. So Team GB has moved way up the table.</p> <p>As we know, the UK is ahead of Russia on golds, but it did better on other medals. If this statistical model only measured gold medals, Team GB would come top.</p> <p>And Anagnostopoulos poses some words of warning for UK celebrants:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although the UK has every right to be proud of its performance, this enthusiasm must be somewhat moderated against the fact that past Olympics have shown a clear presence of a home advantage effect.</p> </blockquote> <p>In 2008, the home team came top. In 2004, Greece ranked 12th according to this model. \"A far superior performance to both before and after it hosted the Olympics.\"</p> <p>Which was the best indicator? Says Anagnostopoulos: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The team size indeed proved to be a fairly good predictor of performance in the Games. However, we do not allow this factor to affect a country's ranking here, since in principle a poor, small country can still produce a relatively large team size, and should not be penalized for that. </p> </blockquote> <p>The full data is published below.

  "<p>The announcement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/13/national-trust-helen-ghosh-director-general\" title=\"\">Dame Helen Ghosh's departure from the top job at the Home Office</a> the morning after the Olympics is likely to leave Whitehall looking \"maler and paler\".</p> <p>It seems a truism of civil service life that cabinet ministers tend to spend their time in office wanting to replace the permanent secretary they inherited from their predecessor with an appointment of their own.</p> <p>This became explicit with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/05/ministers-formal-role-civil-service-appraisals\" title=\"\">Francis Maude's recent controversial suggestion </a>that Cabinet ministers should have a say in appointments to these Whitehall top jobs.</p> <p>But the strange thing in the case of Ghosh, who is to take over as director general of the National Trust, is that she wasn't \"inherited\" by the current home secretary, Theresa May, but appointed by her to the top job in January 2011. She replaced Sir David Normington, who was brought in when Charles Clarke was home secretary back in 2005.</p> <p>Ghosh was the first female permanent secretary at the Home Office in its 256-year history. In 2005, at the time of her appointment to her previous post \u2013 the top job at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) \u2013 she was the only woman to head a major department in the British government.</p> <p>When she arrived at the Home Office she acknowledged it was a \"high-paced, high-profile, highly political department\" where \"something strikes you the moment you walk through the door\".</p> <p>Her 20 months in the job did not let her down: a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jul/17/met-chief-quits-over-phone-hacking\" title=\"\">Metropolitan police commissioner quit</a>, London and the other English cities were swept by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/series/reading-the-riots\" title=\"\">the biggest riots for 30 years</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/16/brodie-clark-theresa-may-fingerprint-checks\" title=\"\">head of the UK border force resigned</a> in a row over passport checks, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/16/g4s-assured-overshoot-olympic-staff-theresa-may\" title=\"\">private security operation for the Olympics</a> looked like going pear-shaped.</p> <p>This rapid sequence of crises has no doubt taken its toll on relations with ministers. But her departure is also likely to mark the end of a period when the last cabinet secretary, Gus (now Lord) O'Donnell, could make his favourite boast that under his watch half the people in charge of government departments were women.</p> <p>Jill Rutter, a former Whitehall high-flyer now at the Institute of Government,<a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/4688/undoing-god%E2%80%99s-work-upcoming-appointments-will-determine-whether-gains-women-made-at-the-top-of-whitehall-prove-short-lived/\" title=\"\"> says </a>there was a moment in early 2011 when that claim was true and women took on some of the big spending beasts such as defence and health. But it has proved a high watermark.</p> <p>Ursula Brennan has been moved sideways from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ); Dame Gill Morgan has announced her early retirement from the top job of permanent secretary to the Welsh government; and Moria Wallace is to stand down in October from the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc).</p> <p>Rutter says that with Sir Suma Chakrabarti's move from the MoJ to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, Whitehall risks being left \"paler and maler\" than it has for some time.</p> <p>Only four women remain at the top: Una O'Brien at the Department of Health, Lin Homer at HM Revenue and Customs, Bronwyn Hill at Defra and Brennan at the MoJ. Ghosh's interim replacement is a woman \u2013 Helen Kilpatrick \u2013 but both the last two jobs have gone to men. There are four outstanding vacancies: at the Home Office, MoD, Cabinet Office and Decc. Who they are filled by will determine whether or not the gender revolution in Whitehall is now over.</p>",

Work has finished successfully on the first, \u00a3170,000, phase of a <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/\">Forestry Commission</a> project to restore one of England's most fragile and threatened areas of bog and mire on the <a href=\"http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk/\">North York Moors</a>.</p> <p>As you can see from the main photograph, the site is in the lee of the <a href=\"http://www.raf.mod.uk/raffylingdales/\">Fylingdales</a> early warning base, whose looming pyramid replaced the more delicate trio of domes which Sir Nikolaus Pevsner described in his <em>Buildings of England </em>as:</p> <blockquote> <p>Three perfect white globes of great size on three perfect black plinths in the grandiose, undulating silence of the moor. The geometry of the space age at its most alluring and most frightening.</p> </blockquote> <p>The bog is <a href=\"http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/uk/langdale-forest.html#cr\">May Moss</a>, part of Langdale forest, and it is reckoned to date back nearly 9000 years in its watery, muddy state. That was at risk because of conifers planted after the Second World War to restore UK timber resources which had been depleted by military demands.</p> <p>At the rate of \u00a31 a tree, in terms of a grant from the <a href=\"http://www.sitatrust.org.uk/\">SITA trust</a>, 170,000 of these have now been removed, with additional help from the North York Moors national park. Prolonged extraction of moisture through their roots has already eased with noticeable effect. Plants such as sphagnum moss and bog rosemary are starting to flourish again, along with dragonflies and many other less striking but ecologically valuable insects.<br>&#xa0;<br>Brian Hicks, an ecologist with the Forestry Commission says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have restored 150 hectares of the bog, twice as much as originally planned, by removing trees and blocking drainage channels to help the site retain rain water. The signs are encouraging with the return of vegetation to areas cleared of trees.&#xa0; Despite appearances this is a living habitat with about a metre of new peat being laid down every 1,000 years.&#xa0; Bogs may not have the profile of rainforests or ancient woods, but ecologically they are just as important.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394646390\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344856990901/Mulcher1.jpg\" alt=\"May Moss\" width=\"460\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scrunch!

Addressing the campaigners, environmental scientist <a href=\"http://www.eggconsult.co.uk/business-model-affiliation/staff-affiliates/aidan-foley-ba-msc-phd/\">Dr Aidan Foley</a> made the same point which Hicks is making over on the North York Moors:</p> <blockquote> <p>I think one of the most important things for people to realise is not only that they can do something about this problem to improve the management of the catchment, the solution to the problem is very simple. It involves filling in the drains on the moors and alllowing them to revegetate. Filling them in lifts the water table, which means that there's greater storage much higher up the catchment. That changes the vegetation again to what it should be, that is sphagnum moss-based. And that's simple and straightforward.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But potentially expensive. Meanwhile, all the different views are being added to a review of evidence about moorland and upland management by Natural England which should finish by the end of the year.</p>",
  "<p>While the world's attention has been focused on the athletes winning medals in the Olympic Park in London, a small team of sports officials from Glasgow has been quietly preparing for the UK's next global sporting event \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.glasgow2014.com/\" title=\"\">the Commonwealth Games in 2014</a>.</p> <p>For several weeks, key figures from the Glasgow Commonweath Games team were embedded in the back room running London 2012, watching and learning from the inside.</p> <p>Now, they say, it is their turn. Energised by the record-breaking feats of Team GB athletes, the headline-grabbing performances of Mo Farah, Chris Hoy and Jessica Ennis, and the London Games' dramatic effect on the nation's mood, staff in Glasgow have been fielding a sharp rise in calls from people keen to volunteer and hungry for tickets.</p> <p>\"Everyone is buzzing,\" said David Grevemberg, the chief executive of Glasgow 2014.</p> <p>Grevemberg calls it the \"bounce\". A survey last Thursday found the number of Scots now considering buying tickets for the Commonwealth Games \u2013 an event that has long lacked the charisma and draw of the Olympics \u2013 had doubled during the London Games, from 14% in March to 29%. For 41% of Scots, the Olympics had increased their excitement about Glasgow 2014, which is being staged at a cost of \u00a3524m.</p> <p>\"Within the context of the UK and the context of the Commonwealth, people are starting to ask the question: well, what's next after London 2012? Following the Paralympics in September, we're the next obvious target, the next obvious event,\" he said.</p> <p>Chris Hoy appeared to rule out competing at the Rio Olympics in 2016 when he said last week he hoped Glasgow would be his swansong. That would be fitting: the Commonwealth Games's cycling events will be staged at a velodrome named in the Scot's honour, and which will be formally opened in October in the east end of the city.</p> <p>Team GB gold medal heptathlete Jessica Ennis, too, has noted that she is only missing a Commonwealth medal in her collection, Grevemberg said. They now have \"world class celebrity status\", he added. By last Friday, more than 130 medals at the London Olympics had been won by competitors from the 71 Commonwealth members due to compete in Glasgow, including Usain Bolt.</p> <p>Grevemberg, originally from New Orleans and former executive director of sports for the International Paralympics Committee, rather hopes the Jamaican will race in Glasgow.</p> <p>\"Some of the most successful performances of British athletes of all time really has just created a buzz and a boost for sport and the Commonwealth Games, in terms of its fraternity, its distinctiveness,\" he said.</p> <p>Attention on the Glasgow Games is likely to be unusually intense for another reason: Scotland and the rest of the UK will be in the throes of the battle over Scottish independence, with Scotland's first minister, Alex Salmond, leading the charge for autonomy. The referendum is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/11/scottish-independence-referendum-autumn-2014\" title=\"\">due to take place in the autumn of 2014</a>: the formal referendum campaign could well start just as the Commonwealth Games end.</p> <p>That conflict could undermine the \"fraternity\" to which Grevemberg refers.</p> <p>Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, plans to use the Games and other major events in 2014 \u2013 specifically the Ryder Cup golf tournament at Gleneagles, and a Scottish clans homecoming festival \u2013 as springboards to promote Scotland's cultural and political vitality, to build up support for independence.</p> <p>Unlike the Olympics, where Team GB rallied all parts of the UK in support of its athletes, Scots, Welsh, English and Northern Irish alike, all these nations will field competing teams at the Commonwealth Games. Hoy and Murray, the Scots stars who both draped themselves in the union flag in London, will compete against Ennis's England.</p> <p>Pro-UK politicians, including Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, saw the surge in support for Team GB during the London Olympics as proof of the strength and resilience of the United Kingdom. They will search for ways to underpin that collective identity at the Glasgow Games.</p> <p>Grevemberg carefully stated that \"the people of Scotland will ultimately have to make the choice of their destiny\" but insisted that the \"purity\" of the Games' founding principles about fraternity, \"unified diversity\" and promoting Commonwealth citizenship would be protected by the Games' organisers and its ruling body, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF).</p> <p>\"I think what's incredibly important is we stay true to that vision that we are the Commonwealth Games and that the CGF, the franchise owner, will ensure that those ideals are upheld,\" Grevemberg said.</p> <p>\"It's up to us to showcase Glasgow and Scotland as a wonderful hub of activity, of culture, of engagement, of entertainment, of a place to do business, of a wonderful place to live, you know, all of those elements, as you do with any major games.</p> <p>\"Those elements do not change, regardless of the ambitions of the government. From that standpoint the ideals of the Games will be upheld. As the event organiser, we need to keep ourselves focused on that vision.\"</p> <p>He added: \"What's most important is we keep our focus. The ambitions around these Games, we've articulated those in our vision: athletes [taking part] in a sport-focused Games, world-class competition that is a celebration throughout the Commonwealth and that does deliver a lasting legacy for Glasgow and Scotland. And that is our mission, quite simply.\"</p> <p>Grevemberg stressed that Glasgow was hosting the Games, a subtle warning that the city was in temporary stewardship of the four-yearly event. \"How politicians engage with this event is up to them but we are very, very focused with the Commonwealth Games Federation to make this a very successful, in fact the most successful Commonwealth Games with all those values central in mind,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Dame Helen Ghosh, the permanent secretary at the Home Office and one of a handful of women at the highest level in major government departments, is to take over as director general of the National Trust when Fiona Reynolds leaves this winter after 12 years in the job.</p> <p>Although Ghosh lists \"looking after her allotment\" and walking among her relaxations, her political nous, experience and contacts book will be more useful in the job she takes up in November. She was previously permanent secretary for five years to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).</p> <p>Under Reynolds, backed by the army of 4 million members \u2013 far more than the combined membership of all major political parties \u2013 and 67,000 regular volunteers, the largest conservation charity in Europe has taken on an increasingly political campaigning role.</p> <p>The trust led the campaign last year that sank the government's plans to part-privatise the nation's forests,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/17/forest-sell-off-abandoned-sorry-caroline-spelman\" title=\"\"> resulting in a U-turn </a>and the environment secretary, Caroline Spelman, being forced into a public apology in parliament.</p> <p>It is keeping<a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/local-to-you/east-of-england/view-page/item787774/\" title=\"\"> a wary eye on a range of planning concerns</a> in the new <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/planningsystem/planningpolicy/planningpolicyframework/\" title=\"\">National Planning Policy Framework</a>, and as the largest landholder in Britain has been a vocal supporter of more environmentally sensitive farming, leading the way on its 250,000 hectares of countryside.</p> <p>In a statement, Ghosh said: \"I have been an admirer of the trust and its work all my life, and I am thrilled that I have been given the chance to be part of its future. I am delighted to be able to build on Fiona Reynolds' great work in setting the trust's direction for the 21st century.\"</p> <p>Sir Simon Jenkins, chairman of the trust, said the board was delighted with the appointment. \"Helen is a distinguished and energetic public servant.

  "<p>It may sound like a cringe-worthy response to a graduate school interview question, but if you ask me why I became a research biologist, I'll still tell you \u2013 23 years after that particular milestone \u2013 that I want to cure diseases. Of course I am deeply fascinated by the nuts and bolts of our body, this incredibly intricate and almost miraculous machine that each of us inhabits. But frankly, new knowledge is not actually my primary driver. For me, science has always been about helping people \u2013 using knowledge to better lives. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394646604\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344854742530/A-Petri-dish-containing-a-008.jpg\" alt=\"A Petri dish containing a bacterial culture\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Urinary pathogens make many people's lives miserable. Photograph: Jennifer Rohn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Rohn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hokey, I know \u2013 but hey, I was born in the American Midwest, where you can say things like this with a straight face and someone might pin a medal on you, or wave a flag \u2013 or even fire off a celebratory AK47 round for added emphasis.</p> <p>If you're not a scientist, you might think that there's only one way to do science. But when you enter into the research community as a fresh-faced newbie, you soon discover \u2013 as with any human endeavour \u2013 that there are different fashions, different camps, different approaches. </p> <p>When I was earning my PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle, basic research was the only game in town. Sure, when the lead investigators wrote their grants, they'd pay lip-service to how their particular plan might lead to a cure for cancer \"in X years' time\" (where X equals the smallest number of years they thought they could get away with without getting laughed out of the room) \u2013 and perhaps it would \u2013 but deep down, they really just wanted to <em>know how it works</em>. The cancer cure would be a lovely bonus, but understanding the complex interplay of all the working parts making our cells behave \u2013 or misbehave \u2013 would be the ultimate intellectual prize.</p> <p>Some scientists can get a bit snobby about basic research. They see it as pure and creative, as an expression of mental freedom unfettered by financial incentives or dictatorial goals. In allowing your mind to take you anywhere, the serendipitous outcomes rain down like windfall apples when you are least expecting them. And there is no doubt that basic research underpins a vast number of today's cures. For example, great leaps forward in our understanding of how cells become cancerous were fuelled by scientists <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rous_sarcoma_virus\">mucking around with animal viruses</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2001/nurse-lecture.html\">yeast</a>.</p> <p>But there is another way to get cures: applied research, when you have a specific practical goal and you work towards it single-mindedly. Jonas Salk, for example, wanted a vaccine for polio, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk\">went all guns blazing</a> until he had a result. It took him and his team just seven years and the programme was hailed as a miraculous success. Nowadays, applied biomedical research is primarily done in the industrial sector, by hungry, fleet-footed biotech companies or by their more bloated but cash-heavy cousins, the Big Pharmas. </p> <p>Applied research is linked, therefore, to the idea of profit, and this makes some scientists uneasy. Others feel that such an approach might be, let's face it, maybe just a little bit square. Who wants to be told what to do? Who wants to be forced to ignore the glimmering hint of something unexpected that accidentally pops up when you're dutifully grafting away at what The Man dictates? Who wants to be a company surveyor, mapping a prescribed area, when he could be a famous explorer hacking his way through the Amazonian undergrowth, getting sucked by leeches and stabbed by mosquitoes before literally tripping over an entirely new species of vine? Who'd ever find that vine, actually, if there wasn't anyone to stumble over it?</p> <p>Personally, I think both types of research are valuable and are worth supporting \u2013 and they overlap so much it's sometimes hard to tell them apart. I've spent most of my time in academia, doing basic research, but I also deeply enjoyed my four focused years in a start-up biotech company, channelling my approach more aggressively into a common goal. </p> <p>This is why when, about five years ago, I perked up my antennae when a new buzzword started to make the rounds in the UK: <em>translational research</em>. Like some exotic hybrid between basic and applied research, this strategy sounded to me like an interesting compromise. The website of the UK's Medical Research Council <a href=\"http://www.mrc.ac.uk/About/Strategy/Governmentfunding/SingleHealthResearchFund/TranslationWorkshop/MRC003672\">defines translational research</a> as \"the process of the bidirectional transfer of knowledge between basic work (in the laboratory and elsewhere) with that of the person, in health or disease.\" </p> <p>The idea is that, instead of doing your basic research in a vacuum, you try to work closely with clinicians and their patients to accelerate the process of finding cures. The MRC's definition emphasises a two-way, iterative strategy: knowledge is trialled in patients, and knowledge about what happens in the patients is fed back to the basic scientists. The <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/funding/technology-transfer/wtd027704.htm\">Wellcome Trust's description is more prosaic</a>: \"Translational research helps turn early-stage innovations into new health products, advancing the innovation to the point where it becomes attractive for further development by the medical, pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries.\" </p> <p>Many of my colleagues are uneasy at the thought of translational research, not least because governments around the world are funnelling increasing amounts of money into such projects. Here in the UK, the major biology funders now all have grant streams tailored to academics who want to partner with industry, and rumour has it that the same science has a better chance of funding there instead of via the basic research counterparts. It is inescapable that in times of austere science funding, channeling money into translational research will take money away from basic research. If you see no value in translational research, of course this feels like robbery. </p> <p>How do I feel about it? As of last year, if you'd come to visit me in the lab, you would have found me using genetics to perturb cancer cells to see why they take up the shapes they do. It doesn't get much more basic than that: how cells move, respond to the environment, flex their pseudopods and interact with the surfaces they find themselves on. Yes, there is a relevance to cancer, as tumor cells become more problematic precisely when they go off-piste and start crawling around the body. And I'm very <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21893601\">proud of the work that I was doing</a>. But for me, something was missing. It felt too abstract, too far removed from the reason I went into science in the first place. </p> <p>So back in February I decided to shift gears and grab at a rare and wonderful opportunity to run a basic sciences lab in a National Health Service clinic attached to my university. The clinic treats patients with chronic urinary tract infection (UTI) \u2013 about 120 people a week, most elderly, all miserable and desperate for relief. UTI is a serious disease, especially in older folks, and normal antibiotics aren't very effective at rooting out the more pernicious cases that we see. </p> <p>As an added bonus for the curious, the biology is absolutely fascinating: while normally free-living, the bacteria that cause chronic UTI (such as <em>E. coli</em>) have evolved ways to physically invade the cells lining the bladder, taking up residence inside those cells and entering a sort of dormancy where antibiotics and the immune system are largely helpless. The patient may think she's better, but deep inside, those bugs are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12843396\">quietly multiplying into massive colonies</a> (known in the trade as \"pods\") that burst out, Alien-style, at a later date to initiate another round of acute infection. </p> <p>All of the tricks I've learned about cell biology and cell shape are immediately applicable to this medical problem. I hit the ground running and have started to make significant progress, performing basic research on a daily basis with urine samples provided by our patients, most of whom are delighted to consent to our experimental needs. Yet a lot of the research I'm doing is also translational, because we're working with collaborators to come up with new therapies and diagnostics and to get them into trials as quickly as possible, and are currently talking to potential industrial partners.</p> <p>I don't know whether governmental initiatives to support more translational research will lead to more cures in the long run \u2013 that little social experiment is still in its early stages. I can only speak anecdotally from my own experiences. In the many years I've spent in academic labs, I've seen lots of incredible basic research projects birthed from a crazy idea in a lab meeting evolve into a fully fledged paper in a good journal, and though many of these findings are likely to underpin cures in the distant future, to my knowledge none is anywhere close.</p> <p>In contrast, I've been in my current position for only half a year, and I'm already preparing to chat with the <a href=\"http://www.mhra.gov.uk/\">Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency</a> to see what we need to do to qualify for clinical trials. It's still a few years away, but we're moving at a brisk pace that I haven't experienced since my biotech days. In a way it's even quicker, because having so many patients to work with is a big boost.</p> <p>So what is the best way to do science to get the best practical benefit for humankind? I think the answer is diversity. By all means let's keep up our strong tradition of cutting-edge basic research that's led to all the unexpected but fantastic applications we all enjoy. But let's not be too resistant to allowing some public money to be spent intelligently in the applied and translational arenas as well. </p> <p>Of course, ultimately, the best way to ensure a strong science base and a healthy economy is to increase our investment in research and development overall, which in the UK at least is in real danger of hitting a damaging minimum. So I'll close with a cheeky plug: If you want to support <a href=\"http://scienceisvital.org.uk/\">Science Is Vital</a>, the grassroots campaign to convince the UK government to support science funding, please consider <a href=\"http://scienceisvitalagm-eorg.eventbrite.co.uk/?ebtv=C\">coming to our first Annual General Meeting</a> on 13 September, and/or donating <em>pi</em> (\u00a33.14) to the cause. </p> <p>With the economy looking to be nowhere near recovery, and with the current science budget hanging by a thread, next year's Spending Review is going to be a battle, and it's one we want to ensure we win. We won't be splitting hairs about how best to do research if we are no longer able to do it at all.</p>",
  "<p>In the post-cuts cultural landscape, collaboration has become the new touchstone. Working together is widely regarded as the way for arts organisations to survive in this environment, but what if that involves looking beyond the creative industries? As the ground beneath us shifts, a surprising word is creeping into the vocabulary of emerging artists: entrepreneurial.</p> <p>This terminology is particularly associated with the work of <a href=\"http://www.theatredelicatessen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Theatre Delicatessen</a>, that over the last four years has established a system of what it calls \"transactions\" \u2013 in-kind exchanges of space, resources and services that have allowed them to put on their work and have this year secured them a residency in the old BBC offices in Marylebone. One step removed from traditional philanthropy, this creative thinking is about the engineering of mutually beneficial partnerships, and it's an approach that is beginning to be more widely adopted.</p> <p>\"It's not just about writing a cheque,\" stresses James Yarker, artistic director of Birmingham-based theatre company <a href=\"http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stan's Cafe</a>, which has a reduced rent agreement on their current space in an unoccupied portion of the AE Harris metal works factory in the city's jewellery quarter. What the theatre company offers the manufacturer in return is sponsorship, access to their work and a renewed place within the community, not to mention a mutual network of support. As Yarker puts it, the artists are now \"part of the company's life\".</p> <p>For those proponents of this model, their enthusiasm verges on the evangelical. \"It's absolutely written into our DNA that it has to work both ways,\" says Ali Robertson, director of the <a href=\"http://tobaccofactorytheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Tobacco Factory Theatre in Bristol</a>. The theatre, which has been housed in this factory since 1998, secured a 25-year rent-free lease on part of its space in 2009, cementing a long-running relationship with the building and its landlord (and saviour from demolition) George Ferguson.</p> <p>Despite the financial element to transactions such as these, the real strength of this approach lies in exchanges that are not based purely on money. While Robertson admits that straightforward philanthropy plays a sizable part in the funding of most arts organisations, including his own, he firmly believes that \"the healthiest relationships are often based on something a bit deeper than that\".</p> <p>The foundations of these relationships can be hard to pin down. Artists often benefit landlords through reducing their business rates by occupying empty space, but exchanges can be based on anything from reviving a local area and bringing in footfall, to running workshops for aspiring thespians in the workforce.</p> <p>At the centre of these collaborations there is typically a sense of community and a simple but unquantifiable commitment to helping one another out on a day-to-day basis. \"If you're writing a cheque for someone, the transaction is quite cold,\" observes Yarker. \"Relationships and collaborations are much softer and much easier in many ways.\"</p> <p>Steven Atkinson, artistic director of <a href=\"http://www.hightide.org.uk/\" title=\"\">High Tide</a>, agrees. Before the theatre company found their current home in the offices of Lansons Communications in Clerkenwell, they spent a year rent-free in another office building, but the arrangement was not sustainable in the long term because they had nothing to offer in return. Now they have a collaborative agreement whereby they are offered space and infrastructure in exchange for the training and entertainment they provide for the Lansons staff. It's a system that Atkinson says \"always ticks all of the necessary boxes\" for both parties.</p> <p>With the recession leaving acres of empty office space in its wake, Atkinson believes there is the opportunity for more such partnerships. \"A lot of companies could offer desk space to not-for-profit organisations and not really feel any drop in their own capacity,\" he claims, urging artists to explore these possibilities.</p> <p>In this spirit, theatre company <a href=\"http://www.tangledfeet.com/\" title=\"\">tangled feet</a> has taken over a floor of office space in central London through a deal brokered by the charity <a href=\"http://www.healthyplanet.org/\" title=\"\">Healthy Planet</a>, opening an arts co-operative along similar lines to the one now operating in Theatre Delicatessen's Marylebone home. In the retail sector, meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://emptyshops.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Empty Shops Network</a> helps artists to temporarily take over deserted high street units to stage performances, installations and community projects.</p> <p>What these examples rely on, however, is the negotiating skill of third party organisations \u2013 help which many artists are not aware of or lack access to. Atkinson speculates whether a government agency might plug the gap, bringing about more relationships with the business sector in response to the dearth of public funding. But for now at least the onus lies with the arts. So how can artists start up these conversations with potential collaborators?</p> <p>\"It's about having a non-scary front,\" laughs Atkinson, though the point he makes is a serious one. One point of agreement between those who have succeeded in this entrepreneurial vein is that it is vital to be flexible and to present a friendly face to those who might be in a position to help but who might also be intimidated by the arts.</p> <p>Yarker, meanwhile, simply advises artists to do what they do best. \"If artists are talking about their work, they're naturally enthusiastic and inspiring,\" he says. \"That's very seductive.\"</p> <p>Of course, beneficial as these partnerships may be, they are not the answer to all of the challenges currently faced by artists. \"It works to a point,\" warns Jessica Brewster, co-artistic director of Theatre Delicatessen. Collaborative agreements with businesses can provide space, resources and a safety net of support, but they do not ultimately pay artists' wages. \"You have to be aware that it's a model that only works so far,\" says Brewster. \"It's not a model that will necessarily give you a living.\"</p> <p>And what about the possible ethical implications? There is crossover here with the concerns frequently raised about corporate sponsorship of the arts and how this might compromise the art being made. The artists I speak to, however, are adamant that these relationships \u2013 if made with companies sympathetic to the work \u2013 needn't interfere with artistic intentions.</p> <p>\"If you can do it without compromising the art that you're trying to make, who wouldn't want to save money in order to spend that money on the art?\" says Atkinson, and he has a point. Although they might not be a substitute for funding, approached with the right attitude these in-kind \"transactions\" can go a long way towards making up the shortfall, as well as developing entire communities as a valuable side-effect. In Atkinson's words, \"it's something of a no-brainer\".</p> <p><em>Catherine Love is a freelance arts journalist \u2013 follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/catherinelove21\" title=\"\"><em>@CatherineLove21</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://lovetheatre.net/\" title=\"\"><em>read more on her blog</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Well, that's it then. That curious hotch-potch of sport known as the modern Olympics <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/13/olympic-games-closing-ceremony-culture\" title=\"\">is done and dusted for the 27th time</a> (if we exclude the intercalated games of 1906 as all good statisticians should).</p> <p>As expected, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/olympics-2012/results-medals-schedule?widget=medals\" title=\"\">London 2012 medal table</a> was led by the United States and China, but it goes without saying that the European community, had its member nations all been playing for the same team, would have comfortably beaten both, in fact surpassed the total of the US and China combined. Of course, the Olympic Games has always been, essentially, a European affair. Sixteen of those 27 editions have, after all, been held in Europe.</p> <p>To give the Olympic movement its due (which is not a phrase familiar to Olympic journalists), it has inched away from a Eurocentric games. But it's not a radical change and the induction of golf and rugby union to the 2016 Games in Brazil only amplifies the feeling that the United States-Europe TV axis is still driving the whole show.</p> <p>You always know a sport is a dubious recruit if it fails the pre-eminence test; that is, the Olympic competition is not the most-valued for that sport. As an example, no athlete would ever trade an Olympic gold medal for a world title. It's their most valued possession. But it doesn't work for tennis, say, where Andy Murray would swap <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/05/andy-murray-roger-federer-olympics-live\" title=\"\">his Olympic gold</a> for Federer's eighth Wimbledon title in an instant. He would, trust me.</p> <p>So it is that golf and rugby waved into the Olympics for 2016 are sports that do not need the Games either. It's the wrong way forward. What the Games needs is sports that invest totally in the Olympic ethos, and sports that bring global diversity. How about these?</p> <p><strong>Foot-volley</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/maM2sNmmBsE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/maM2sNmmBsE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As baseball and softball found to their cost, the Olympics is full already, so for every sport that arrives, one must leave. They both went. There are other ways to make room, though. Merging sports is a progressive way forward. Football fails the pre-eminence test (see above), and beach volleyball fails on the grounds that any sport with beach in its title isn't really a sport. So the answer surely is to merge them and, as I'm sure you know, the merged sport already exists. It's called foot-volley, was invented in Brazil in 1965, and was played by such footballing eminences as Romario and Ronaldo.</p> <p><strong>Sepaktakraw</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-CP6ykzsK0M?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-CP6ykzsK0M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another composite sport that bears consideration is sepaktakraw, which is either one word, two words or a hyphenated word (your choice). Sepaktakraw is somewhat similar to foot-volley, but played on an indoor court (or a beach, but we don't talk about that) with a rattan ball (made with palm leaves) and at a tempo that could best be described as prestissimo and some. It's compelling watching \u2013 bicycle kicks are de rigueur \u2013 but that's not the real reason for inclusion: Malaysia has attended 14 Olympics and still awaits its first gold medal. They would have a serious chance in this sport, though they wouldn't want to meet Thailand in the final.</p> <p><strong>Capoeira</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/51q1VB_dDik?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/51q1VB_dDik\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Not until the Tokyo Games in 1964, when judo joined the fold, did the Olympics embrace martial arts. Taekwondo, having twice been a demonstration sport, was the second to join in 2000. A third martial art has long been on the cards, with karate and wushu persistently arguing their corners. But capoeira has two distinctive claims: firstly that it is not Asian in origin (like judo and taekwondo), but South American; and secondly that it is performed to music. The Olympics is currently obsessed with music. It may seem the last thing a gymnast would need in those precarious moments on a 10cm beam is a rock'n'roll backing track, but that's what has been happening. A disco beat when you're triple-jumping; garage for dressage and hip-hop for the high jump. This is the new Olympic world and capoeira has its place in it.</p> <p><strong>Dragon-boat racing</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/evasUPU2ZTs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/evasUPU2ZTs\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, but only three Olympic sports take place on it: sailing, rowing and canoeing (well, if you exclude swimming, diving and a few horsey jumps that take place in it). There must surely be room for another sport on water, and one with a rich tradition and a theatrical flourish should surely prove irresistible. An ornate dragon's head prow, 20 or so paddlers in near-perfect unison, a drummer beating the stroke (think how good Redgrave and Pinsent would have been with that) and a sweep with a 10ft rudder steering the boat. It was good enough for the Asian Games, which adopted the sport in 2010.</p> <p><strong>Kabbadi</strong></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bKw5Bs7HiGk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bKw5Bs7HiGk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>For a country of its size and population, India has exceptionally poor return from its Olympic involvement: nine Olympic titles, eight of them from hockey. There would have been a few more had cricket (by far the most popular sport in India) been Olympic, but that, too, would fall down on the pre-eminence principal. Kabbadi is not the easiest sport to comprehend, and Channel 4's attempt sell it to the British public 20 years ago failed on those grounds, but clarity has never been a major concern of the IOC.

  "<p>There was never a guarantee that it would amount to anything for us.

In 1908, at the height of the British empire, it was a last-minute choice, stepping in for Rome after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. In 1948, Germany and Japan were banned following their wartime defeat, the Soviet Union was absent and this was the 'austerity Olympics' in a broke country. So, how does 2012 compare?</p> <p>The House of Commons Library, the team which usually supplies MPs with the answers to tricky research questions, is publishing the ultimate statistical guide to how Britain, London and the Olympic games themselves have changed. Olympic Britain, out today, charts how the world the Olympians of 1908 knew would seem unrecogniseable today. And how we got there.</p> <p>In 1908, the first modern Olympics of 1896 were still a live memory, and this was quite a different world. The majority of the competitors came from the imperial empires of Britain, Russia, Germany, the Austro-Hungarians and France, plus the new power: America. The five rings of the Olympic symbol weren't invented until Baron Pierre De Coubertin presented it to the world in 1914.</p> <p>Although the colonies were allowed to participate, it was hardly encouraged for fear it would lead to national identity and undermine their European masters. Two indigenous Africans from South Africa had been allowed to compete in the St Louis games of 1904, featuring in 'athletic games for savages', although they were allowed to enter the marathon, finishing ninth and twelfth out of 36. It wasn't until 1952 that any other sub Saharan country participated, Ghana, although it didn't win a medal until Clement Quartey won a boxing silver in 1960.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/10/london-olympic-charts-medals-competitors\">Read more</a></p> <h2>11.

  "<p>Independent News &amp; Media has received an offer for its South African newspapers. But INM is still hoping to attract a bigger bid, reports Ireland's <a href=\"http://www.businesspost.ie/\">Sunday Business Post</a>.</p> <p>In a piece published yesterday (not yet online), the paper said a consortium led by Iqbal Surv\u00e9, who chairs Sekunjalo Investments (SKJ), has made a \u20ac240m (\u00a3188m) bid for the division.</p> <p>Though that offer has emerged in public, INM is continuing with what it calls a thorough process to assess other potential interest. </p> <p>There is also a possibility that the group could be split up with at least one private equity group showing an interest in acquiring the company's free titles.</p> <p>But Surv\u00e9's Sekunjalo appears to be the only concrete bid. He is described as a doctor, philanthropist and social entrepreneur. His group holds investments in more than 70 private and public companies in South Africa.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.iol.co.za/business/companies/sekunjalo-gunning-for-inmsa-1.1358567#.UCjMIUTaH6Q\">an anonymous source quoted in one of INM's papers</a>, the Sekunjalo offer \"has money and is bankable and it's underwritten by a global investment bank.\"</p> <p>INM publishes leading titles in South Africa's main cities - including The Star in Johannesburg, The Cape Times in Cape Town, The Mercury in Durban and the Pretoria Times.</p> <p>Its South African operations account for about a third of its revenue and half of its operating profit.

  "<p>Of course, it hasn't been a ball for everyone. From the West End to some of Stratford's smaller traders there have been signs that for some the Games have been bad for business. There are parts of London that have scarcely been touched by the Games, and as the media pendulum has swung from cynical to ecstatic the voices of those who've found the experience boring or oppressive have barely been heard. I still think it's a sad thing that the marathon route couldn't have gone through the East End, whose people are supposed to be the principle \"legacy\" beneficiaries (much, much more on those tricky legacy issues to come). </p> <p>But I've loved Olympic London. The beauty of the Games has been the brilliance with which they have crystalised some of the very best things about the capital before Londoners' very eyes. We've been able to see the strengths of our city with special clarity and, hopefully, the need to build on those in order to solve some of the problems - the cost of living, unemployment, youth crime - which, sadly, have not just conveniently gone away. Here are five things that have brought me pride and joy.</p> <p><strong>One: public transport</strong>. Every time I stand at a small town bus stop I'm reminded that London's public transport systems are a miracle, a wonder and a gift. For months running into years Olympics \"transport chaos\" has been feared, predicted and at times almost gleefully anticipated. It hasn't happened. Even when the Piccadilly Line had a bad day, London did not grind to a halt. The Games have been a bit of a triumph for Transport for London - a gold medal performance that deserves a big, loud cheer.</p> <p><strong>Two: Mohamed Farah</strong> For me, the slow-building drama of the long-distance runner - always alone, even in an 80,000-strong crowd - is the most compelling in track and field. Like everyone else, I roared Mo home to his two golds. And what a shining light of a star. Born in Somalia, brought up in London from age eight, Farah is a man for whom there is no contradiction between between a Muslim, a Londoner and a Briton. A living, heroic symbol of the bankruptcy of cultural assimilationists, of nationalist essentialists, of fundamentalists of every kind, be they from the far right, the mainstream right, the self-styled \"listening\" left or the ranks of religious conservatives. We can be different and alike at the same time - and in London we do that <strong>all</strong> the time.</p> <p><strong>Three: the games-maker volunteers</strong>. Not all the people in purple working in London were from the capital, but they collectively still illustrated to the world that a global city, culturally kaleidoscopic at every level, can be a harmonious and generous one. I lapped up their good cheer at Games venues, saw them heading to their work from homes in streets close to my own, talked to them on buses and trains. Glorious, giving humanity, some of it right on my own doorstep, and a reminder that even in the bad times it is always there.</p> <p><strong>Four: the Olympic Park</strong>. A beautiful creation, ours for decades to come. </p> <p><strong>Five: discovering London again</strong>. My Games time experiences caused me to relate to London in different ways, refreshing the city for me, reminding me of the different ways that I belong here. Going to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2012/jul/31/olympic-transport-greenwich-park\">Greenwich Park with my family</a> for the eventing cross-country day simulated a visitor experience, separated me a little from my usual London self, helped me see the place through tourists' eyes. I felt welcome, safe, embraced. </p> <p>Going to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/davehillblog/2012/aug/08/london-hydpe-park-olympics-triathlon\">Hyde Park for the men's triathlon</a> with my youngest child re-connected me, shepherding a 10 year-old through parts of the capital I know well but that she is too young to have begun exploring for herself. On the way home I showed her the pub where her maternal grandparents, who'd arrived separately from rural Ireland, met and fell in love in a long-ago London still dragging itself from the rubble of war. </p> <p>She peeked inside, then stood outside for a photo. She'd found a new piece of the city that she could, in a small way, call her own. It was nothing to do with sport, but it was Games Time that gave it to her. Lovely.</p>",

  "<p>Vietnam will donate 5,000 tonnes of rice to North Korea after recent flooding, which has left crops devastated, more than 160 people dead and 212,200 homeless, according to state media.</p> <p>The donation may help assuage fears of a widespread famine like the one that killed an estimated 1 million in the 1990s. But UN officials warned on Thursday that the full crop damage and food scarcity facing North Korea won't be known until an assessment is completed next month.</p> <p>More than 65,000 hectares of farmland have been washed away since floods began in late June, following a severe drought. Around 5,000 houses, 300 public buildings and 60 factories have been destroyed by the floods, renewing concerns about Pyongyang's capacity to feed its people and to carry out damage control. UN agencies said in June that two-thirds of the country's 24 million population were facing chronic food shortages.</p> <p>North Korea is prone to flooding as much of its mountainous terrain has been deforested to grow crops on terraces. This creates landslides in heavy rains, says Leeds University Korea analyst Aidan Foster-Carter. \"North Korea is incredibly vulnerable to natural disasters because of their natural environment and what they've done to it over the years,\" he says. \"Before the country was divided in 1945, the south was the rice bowl \u2026 [Now] North Korea is about 1m tonnes short of food every year.\"</p> <p>Vietnam vowed to make the donation at a meeting on Monday in Hanoi between the Vietnamese president, Truong Tan Sang, and North Korea's visiting head of state, Kim Yong-nam. The two leaders promised to foster the \"traditional friendship\" between the nations and promote further economic co-operation, particularly in agriculture, Vietnam's state newspaper Nhan Dan reported.</p> <p>Rice is the largest source of calories for most Asians and is the continent's most important crop, but <a href=\"http://www.adb.org/features/12-things-know-2012-rice\" title=\"\">consumption is rapidly declining</a> due to rising incomes and resulting lifestyle changes, according to the Asian Development Bank. The world's two main rice producers, Vietnam and Thailand, are <a href=\"http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/local/306543/rice-scheme-is-pro-rich\" title=\"\">facing their own crop crises of sorts</a> as both are engaged in <a href=\"http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Economy/228544/farmers-lose-out-on-rice-deal.html\" title=\"\">costly and questionable rice schemes</a>. Claudia von Roehl, the UN World Food Programme's representative in North Korea, says the nation is \"quite far away\" from a repeat of the 1990s famine, but warns that the overall health of the population is of concern.</p> <p>\"We should always be aware there is a very chronic and severe problem in the nutrition of the population, and, in particular, the very monotonous diet, which is basically composed of maize and rice \u2013 carbohydrates \u2013 and lacking very significantly in proteins and fats,\" she said.</p> <p>The WFP is providing emergency food assistance \u2013 in the form of 400g of maize \u2013 to about 102,000 people in 23 flood-affected counties. Fear of disease has spread after it was discovered that drinking wells had been contaminated by overflowing latrines. Pumping stations and water sources were also contaminated or damaged by the floods, according to the UN.</p> <p>The UN will complete a full food assessment in late September, looking at the impact of the floods and drought on the main harvest. UN agencies hope that the assessment will give them a greater idea of the new leadership of Kim Jong-un, who took over after his father's death in December, as the assessment will include meetings with North Korea's ministry of agriculture. Analysts believe economic reform \u2013 including a revised look at food security \u2013 could be on the cards, but no one knows how radical it might be or when it might happen.</p>",
  "<p>Politicians have lined up to declare the London 2012 Olympics a rousing success. The prime minister, David Cameron, said Britain had \"delivered\"; Boris Johnson, the London mayor, declared London had demonstrated it was the \"capital of the world\"; while the former prime minister Tony Blair called it a \"spectacular success\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/borisjohnson/9471567/London-2012-Olympics-London-and-Team-GB-take-a-bow.-Youve-dazzled-the-world.html\" title=\"\">Writing in the Telegraph</a>, Johnson noted it was time for \"a little\" triumphalism and \"pointless displays of irritating flag-waving jingo\", after a Games that he said had comprehensibly proved doubters wrong.</p> <p>\"There were people who were worried that the transport network would not hold up, and that there would be delays on the Tube, and that our antiquated systems would not cope and that there would be a general embarrassment. Remember them?\" he wrote.</p> <p>Instead the transport system had been so efficient that officials \u2013 who were expected to use Olympic lanes throughout the city \u2013 took to the Underground; the armed forces had worked well with the much-criticised private security firm G4S, and spending was up in the capital, Johnson said.</p> <p>The opening ceremony had been \"the best in memory\", despite fears that London would not be able to \"find the resources and the discipline to match the sheer pyrotechnic firepower of the Chinese opening ceremony\".</p> <p>Johnson wrote: \"As things have turned out, I reckon we have knocked Beijing \u2013 with all respect to our Chinese friends, and greatly though I admired those Games \u2013 into a cocked hat.\"</p> <p>London had been fully immersed in an inescapable feel-good factor, said Johnson. \"Across London there has been a happy maelstrom of parties and celebration&#xa0;... it has been everywhere, and not just in the centre. Yesterday I cycled down the canal towpath to the Olympic Park, through Hackney; and everywhere I looked there were scenes of riparian merriment of the kind you expect to see at the Henley regatta.\"</p> <p>People who doubted the Games would provide a lasting legacy would also be proved wrong, he insisted. \"These Games have not changed us. They have revealed us as we are: people who can pull off great feats,\" he wrote. \"London has put on a dazzling face to the global audience. For the first time since the end of the empire, it truly feels like the capital of the world.\"</p> <p>Speaking at a Downing Street press conference to announce sports would continue to receive \u00a3125m a year up to the next Games in Rio de Janeiro, Cameron said the Olympics would have immediate economic benefits and could kickstart an economic recovery.</p> <p>\"You only need two words to sum up these Games: Britain delivered,\" he said. \"We showed the world what we are made of, we reminded ourselves what we can do and we demonstrated that you should never ever count Team GB down and out.'\"</p> <p>Cameron said the Olympics had brought the nations of the UK closer together. \"It's a Britain where English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish compete in one team and drape themselves in one flag.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair, prime minister when London bid successfully for the Olympics in 2005, said the Games had portrayed a modern, multicultural Britain, proud of both its heritage and traditions and its diverse culture.</p> <p>\"I think the country has celebrated its values in a fantastic way throughout the Olympics,\" he said. \"We did deliver, the prime minister was right.\" Blair added that the sporting momentum created by the Olympics must not be lost. \"The first thing [we need to do] is make sure we maintain the support for elite sport. Although sport is not only about the people who compete in the Olympics, it does give an enormous boost to sport and to sporting activity, as we have seen.</p> <p>\"The second thing is to focus again on school sport. Over the last 15 years or so, there was huge investment in school sport and school sport facilities. I think we need to make sure that is maintained.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the year the Queen celebrates her Diamond Jubilee, Centre for Cities looked back at the shape of urban Britain in the final year of her grandmother Queen Victoria's reign. What we found was that while the geography of our economy looked very different in 1901, the patterns of city performance that we still see today were already emerging.</p> <p>The industrial revolution was built on northern powerhouses such as Manchester and Liverpool. By 1901 the industrialised parts of the north and Midlands accounted for nearly 35% of England's population, compared to around 25% today.</p> <p>Many of our cities in these areas were reliant on heavy industry such as ship building, textiles and dock working. But much of this employment was cyclical and more susceptible to wider changes in the economic climate than other industries. The casual nature of employment in these sectors meant the typical response of employers to downturns was to either cut wages or lay off workers.</p> <p>With the exception of Blackpool, heavy industry accounted for at least 45% of total employment in every city north of Mansfield. In Bradford it hit 59%, in Middlesbrough 64% and in Burnley it hit a high of 68%. So while heavy industry was a big source of jobs, it did not usually provide stable employment for its workers. Instead, it created periods in and out of employment for many people working in the north.</p> <p>The reverse was observed in towns and cities in the south of England. These cities were much less reliant on cyclical employers; in Reading just 33% of workers were employed in these industries. Southern cities also had a greater proportion of service jobs and had a higher share of workers in professional occupations. In Bournemouth, for example, there were 10 times the proportion of men employed in professional occupations than in Nottingham.</p> <p>The industrial profile of the towns and cities in the south meant that they were in a better starting position to adapt to changes in the structure of the national economy throughout the 20th century. Services overtook manufacturing as the largest employment sector as early as the 1920s, and today it accounts for 84% of all jobs in England and Wales. Manufacturing accounts for just 9% of all employment, down from more than 40% in 1901.</p> <p>The pace of this change varied hugely across cities. In 1901, services were already a bigger employer than manufacturing in Bournemouth. But it wasn't until the 1970s that services employment overtook manufacturing in Rochdale.</p> <p>Despite these employment trends, UK manufacturing is and will remain important to our economy. It is a big investor in research and development, and some of our manufacturers are world leaders. Nevertheless, looking at urban development over the last century tells us two things about future patterns of economic growth.</p> <p>First, manufacturing is highly unlikely to be a net contributor to the jobs growth that the country needs. In order to remain competitive in the global marketplace, manufacturing is continually improving in productivity, producing more goods with fewer workers. The UK is not alone here; even Germany has seen manufacturing's share of total employment halve in recent decades in response to global competition.</p> <p>Second, cities need to continue adapting to changes in the national economy. Many cities have grappled with the impact of structural change in the second half of the 20th century and some of this industrial legacy continues to manifest itself to this day.</p> <p>The answer is not to attempt to turn back the clock. The assets that helped cities thrive in the 1900s are no longer the economic strengths they were. Instead cities need to focus on the distinctive assets that will help them thrive in a 21st-century economy, and to invest more generally in skills and transport, which our work shows to be important for growth and prosperity in the 21st century.</p> <p>Looking back at the last 110 years of urban development shows that history matters for a city's economic performance. The challenge for current and future policy makers is to ensure that cities are not beholden to their past, but instead make the most of their assets as they look to the future.</p> <p><em>Paul Swinney is an economist who </em><a href=\"http://www.centreforcities.org/paul.html\" title=\"\"><em>leads on data analysis for Centre for Cities</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Today marks the centenary of the death of one of social housing's most significant figures \u2013 Octavia Hill, a woman who fought for decent living conditions for London's poor communities through the 1880s. In her day she was a radical pioneer: a middle-class, single woman who chose to live in impoverished areas of the capital and try to improve the lives of thousands; a social reformer who cared that rich Londoners had more access to green space than poor Londoners. But are her values and models still relevant for housing professionals a century on?</p> <p>Octavia Hill's most enduring legacy was the provision of safe, comfortable homes for more than 3,000 people in Victorian London, but she was also a pioneer of modern social care. Hill introduced the concept of joined-up services long before it became a fashionable political policy. She believed housing management was about more than putting a roof over someone's head. It was about the totality view of a tenant's life \u2013 their job security, health and happiness.</p> <p>By personally collecting rent, Hill was able to develop a close relationship with her tenants and assess their needs more accurately. Although door-to-door rent collection seems antiquated in today's social housing context, plans to change the way housing and other benefits are distributed gives housing associations new opportunities to re-evaluate existing roles and relationships with their tenants.</p> <p>Kevin Williamson, head of communities and wellbeing at the National Housing Federation, is optimistic about change. \"Evidence indicates that housing associations have a very good record of stepping in and giving a hand-up to their tenants at times when it is needed most. That is not to say that the future is without risk, there are more choppy waters ahead. But we should be encouraged by the record of associations in supporting their communities.\"</p> <p><strong>Work and poverty</strong></p> <p>While this is encouraging, <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/benefit-cap-wr2011-ia.pdf\" title=\"\">67,000 households</a> will be affected by housing benefit cuts in 2013-14. These families need work and an alternative source of income if they are to stay living in the same house in the same community. Octavia Hill faced similar problems but her solution to joblessness was simple: create the work yourself. In 1870 she set up the Walmer Street Industrial Experiment with the aim of providing work and training for people living in 200 dwellings.</p> <p>Many housing associations today run training programmes to help their tenants gain skills and qualifications. Octavia Housing, the social landlord founded by Hill, employs 40 residents and in the last year supported 126 to gain new skills through resident involvement and employment programmes. Chief executive Grahame Hindes says: \"Continuing Octavia Hill's legacy, we aim to employ residents wherever we can. To support those that might not be immediately ready for work, we run employment and training and volunteering programmes, and are launching apprenticeships this year.\"</p> <p>The independence and wellbeing of tenants remains central to housing professionals today, but if housing associations are to continue to provide these broader services, they may need to be better resourced. \"Greater recognition by ministers and policy makers of the role that housing associations can play, would not only help to secure this vital work, it would also help open up opportunities for delivering more outcomes more effectively for local communities,\" says Williamson.</p> <p><strong>Green space</strong></p> <p>Hill also fought for better quality of life for her tenants through the campaign to protect green space. In her 1888 essay More Air For London, she expressed alarm at the lack of open space in London's less affluent districts. \"There are indeed many good things in life which may be unequally apportioned and no such serious loss arise, but the need of quiet, the need of air, the need of exercise, and, I believe, the sight of sky and of things growing, seem human needs, common to all men and not to be dispensed with without great loss.\"</p> <p>This belief that green space was imperative to health and happiness was heard when she advised the Ecclesiastical Commission on managing its growing housing portfolio. Despite the poor housing standards at the time, Hill's suggestions included the enlightened ideals of access to personal gardens and front doors, and the requirement that homes should have plenty of light.</p> <p>In today's political climate, where the housing shortage in London is reaching crisis point, the debate about the need for open space is reaching fever pitch. Some now suggest it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/may/16/london-greenbelt-development-policy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">time to abandon the green belt</a> around the capital. According to Ben Cowell, deputy director for external affairs at the National Trust, it is more important than ever to hold firm to Hill's values.</p> <p>\"The fact that London has so many green spaces today is only because of Octavia Hill's work in the 1880s. We needed it then and we need it now. But the solution to the housing shortage has to be in smart, well-designed open spaces. People who are living in communal buildings should have access to shared open spaces that are attractive and well looked after.\"</p> <p>\"Planning authorities,\" Cowell adds \"need to have specific policies in their local plans that relate to green spaces.\"</p> <p>By 2020 the number of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5811433/More-than-two-million-British-homes-without-a-garden.html\" title=\"\">homes in England without gardens</a> is expected to rise to 2.6 million, and more front gardens than ever are being paved over to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/18/front-gardens-paved-parking-spaces\" title=\"\">create extra parking spaces</a>. As London's population grows we can expect more pressure on public open spaces.</p> <p>Octavia Hill's lasting legacy is clear: a century on her methods and morals are as relevant to today's housing sector as they were to Victorian London. With welfare reform just months away from implementation, it is a poignant time to reflect on Hill's work and ask ourselves whether and how the role of housing associations could be expanded. Will Hill's overarching goal of making \"lives noble, homes happy and family life good\" be upheld by those responsible for that change in 2012?</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://housingjobs.theguardian.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",

The prospects of building a far larger ground in London are always disheartening. Queens Park Rangers, however, are at least undaunted.</p> <p>Philip Beard, the chief executive, contrived to be chirpy when reflecting on the fact that it would take five years at the very least to bring into being a new home with 45,000 seats. \"That gives us the time to cultivate the brand and the support of QPR,\" he declared.</p> <p>In practice, an impressive ground might be the quickest way of all to increase attendances substantially. As Beard appreciates, though, there are no swift or easy means to create large football facilities in London. QPR should at least be encouraged that they are likely to have a modern training centre at Warren Farm next season.</p> <p>A stadium is a much more troubling topic. Even Roman Abramovich must be getting downcast as he ponders the challenge of giving Chelsea a ground with a greater capacity than the current 42,000 at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Realism is unavoidable at QPR. Tony Fernandes, the majority shareholder in the club since last year, has business acumen and a sense of caution. \"I think it's important not just to throw money at the game,\" he said. That calmness, all the same, does not mean that he is passive.</p> <p>Neil Warnock took QPR into the Premier League last year. \"He's a special guy, we're very happy with him,\" Fernandes said at the time.</p> <p>The contentment did not last when Warnock went eight games without a win in the league. He was sacked in January. His replacement Mark Hughes did enough to keep QPR in the top flight.</p> <p>There has been a sensible craving for security after the team conceded 66 goals in the Premier League season, with only the relegated clubs doing worse. The goalkeeper Rob Green has joined after leaving West Ham. Ryan Nelsen saw little action after a move from Blackburn Rovers to Tottenham Hotspur in January, but Hughes may feel that the know-how of a 34-year-old has a higher value for QPR.</p> <p>No one at least can accuse the club of delusions. Little cash, for instance, has changed hands so far in the close season. Park Ji-sung has joined from Manchester United with the initial fee reported to be \u00a32m. It is scarcely an eye-catching sum and the midfielder is 31, but his consistency and general ability were appreciated at Old Trafford. Another United player, the full-back F\u00e1bio da Silva, has arrived on loan.</p> <p>Although it makes sense to deal in well-known quantities, there is also a need to bring some vivacity to the team and there has been a breadth to Hughes's acquisitions. Junior Hoilett, who left Blackburn Rovers at the end of his contract, has it in him to beat opponents and bring some extra liveliness to QPR's approach. The Canadian was in the Ewood Park youth programme from the age of 13.</p> <p>Hughes, as Blackburn manager, overlapped with Hoilett for a year and would had a sense of the player's potential even if the youngster was out on loan to the German club Paderborn. That sort of familiarity is even more marked in the case of Nelsen, whose long stay at Blackburn included three full seasons under the management of Hughes.</p> <p>There are assets at Loftus Road and Joey Barton could be numbered among them were it not for the fact that his career is being swamped by controversies. The midfielder was sent off at Manchester City at the close of last season with mayhem breaking out once he had been shown the red card. That did not merely help the hosts take the title.</p> <p>His misconduct led to a 12-match ban and, of late, he has made pre-season appearances for Fleetwood Town to recover match fitness.</p> <p>His omission from QPR's's pre-season tour to Malaysia could well be interpreted as a form of exclusion, but it would hardly have made practical sense for the club to involve a player who could not be considered for selection once the real season is in progress. There had been briefly been talk of the club cancelling his contract although that did not appear feasible in reality.</p> <p>The club, after all, did value a footballer who had come to them after four years with Newcastle United. Barton started 31 of QPR's league matches last season. It is obvious that there will be a reluctance even to try and rehabilitate him but professional sport normally deals in practicalities. The 29-year-old may yet re-emerge.</p>",

They chose the north because of our warm welcome and outstanding facilities. Sheffield, Scunthorpe and Gateshead's <a href=\"http://thesagegateshead.org/\">Sage</a> all played host to the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/about-us/cultural-olympiad/\">Cultural Olympiad</a>, and a large contingent of the 70,000 pink-uniformed <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/spectators/games-maker/\">Games Maker </a>volunteers who made the Olympics happen came from the north. </p> <p>Above all, the north \u2013 and Yorkshire in particular \u2013 has provided the athletes and coaches who powered Team GB to Olympic glory. Sheffield's Jessica Ennis, Ingleby Barwick's Kat Copeland, and the Brownlee brothers from Leeds, to name just a few. We can also claim honorary northerner (Salford-based) Sir Chris Hoy. They, and many others, all put the north<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/aug/06/team-gb-medal-winners-background#county\"> above traditional Olympic titans</a> such as Australia and Russia in the medals table; they really did put the north on the global stage. <br> What's even more uplifting is that the ambition, passion and energy that took Ennis &amp; Co. to the top of the podium were already bountiful in their home towns. Visit Leeds, York, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield or Newcastle and you'll find self-confident cities bustling with ambitious young professionals, new shops, rising investment and growing infrastructure. </p> <p>Just last month, \u00a3560m of new rail spending<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/16/manchester-greater-manchester\"> was injected</a> into the Northern Hub, John Lewis has signed up as anchor tenant for the long-awaited <a href=\"http://www.eastgateleeds.co.uk/\">Harewood development </a>in Leeds, and the North East's businesses have won over \u00a3120 million worth of Games-related business. No wonder then that Kevin Grady, Chair of Leeds Civic Trust<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/07/leeds-yorkshire-olympics-brownlee-john-lewis\"> says his city</a> is having its \"best couple of months for several years\". The image of the north painted by Parry's 'dark satanic mills' - which hasn't been true for a long time - has gone forever. The north is a vibrant, dynamic network of towns, cities and communities, full of life and colour. <br> But we can't be complacent. We must still work hard to ensure that the Olympic legacy benefits the north's poorest communities too, not just our city centres and leafy suburbs. The Olympic legacy will mean nothing if it doesn't reach our inner-cities and our neediest kids \u2013 our future Olympians. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.magicbreakfast.com/\">Magic Breakfast</a> is the UK's leading school breakfast club charity and we run 45 school breakfast clubs in the north (and over 200 nationally), focused on inner-city Sheffield, Rotherham, Bradford, Leeds, Blackburn, Manchester and Liverpool. We feed hundreds of hungry children every morning in the north (and 6,000 kids nationally) with no government funding, relying on the generosity and support of individual givers and businesses like Leeds-based Bagel Nash who supply us with high-energy bagels. </p> <p>We want the Olympics to inspire our kids to lead healthy, sporty lifestyles, but we also want the north's successful businesses, Olympians and local policymakers to work with us to solve the problem of child hunger and poverty for good. The lasting Olympic legacy must be that the north's poorest communities and hungriest children have the opportunity of a better future. </p> <p>Let's hope too that the northern Games Makers bring back the passion they showed at the Olympic Park and use their talents and energy to help us build a strong Olympic legacy in northern communities: starting new businesses, volunteering for good causes, and working with charities like ours to take on the engrained social challenges like poverty that hold back our young people. Ambitious quangos such as <a href=\"http://www.yorkshire-gold.com/\">Yorkshire Gold</a> have been set up to ensure the region benefits economically and culturally from London2012. Community charities like Magic Breakfast are working hard to ensure that we benefit socially too.<br> We were treated to a fantastic Olympic closing ceremony on Sunday, showcasing all that's best about Britain: our musical heritage and creative industries; our armed forces; our athletes; and our volunteers who've come from every corner of the land. Like Danny Boyle's inspirational <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony\">opening ceremony</a>, it was a wonderful celebration of all we've achieved as a nation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394630633\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344794437923/AlanMak.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Mak\" width=\"140\" height=\"150\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Let's also make the end of these fantastic Olympics the start of Britain's long-lasting Olympic legacy, which sees us build a fairer, stronger, more equal country where every young person has opportunity, with the north at the heart of that new nation.

  "<p>Figures obtained from UK Sport, the strategic body overseeing performance sport in the UK, detail the amount of money invested in each Olympic sport since the 2008 Beijing Olympics. We have compared this data with the amount of medals won by Team GB at London 2012.</p> <p>The largest amounts of UK Sport money were spent on rowing (\u00a327m), cycling (\u00a326m) and athletics (\u00a325m). The high overall costs of cycling - particularly in its the track form - lie in the need for the latest technology in bikes, helmets and clothing; such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/31/british-cycling-hot-pants-olympic\">'hot pants'</a> used to keep Team GB cyclists' muscles warm before their race.</p> <p>British cyclists won 12 medals in London, including 7 golds in the velodrome, with technological superiority no doubt playing an important part in their successes. This puts spending on cycling in perspective - the average spend per cycling medal was \u00a32.2m, compared with \u00a38.4m of spending for each Olympic swimming medal (overall spend \u00a325m).</p> <p>The rowers also provided value for money. Their nine medals, four of which were gold, meant the average expense per medal was \u00a33m. British boxing proved the most cost effective of all, as Team GB's five medals put the average cost of a boxing medal at \u00a31.9m.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the figures are skewed towards sports with a larger number of individual chances to win a medal. In hockey, Team GB's women won a bronze medal, putting the cost of that medal at \u00a315m. It was only ever possible for Team GB to win 2 medals in hockey, as opposed to swimming or cycling, in which there were many more medal contenders.</p> <p>Total UK Sport funding for the London 2012 Olympics was \u00a3264,143,753, up from \u00a3235,103,000 spent on the Beijing Games. For London 2012, money from UK Sport was supplemented by a private sponsorship scheme known as 'Team 2012'.</p> <p>Since 2008, a total of around \u00a3100m per year has been invested in 1,200 athletes competing across 47 different sports in both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"data\">Download the data</a></h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AuKpKzUJbSqtdE1DZm5TVHFQZ3UyVUdDZEdySzhBSVE&amp;output=html\">DATA: download the full spreadsheet</a></p> <h2>NEW!

  "<p>At a meeting with a group of Colombian NGOs the other day, a political analyst summed up the mission of Juan Manuel Santos, who is completing two years as president of Colombia this week, in two words: modernisation and decency. These two words could hardly be applied to Santos's predecessor, hardliner Alvaro Uribe, many of whose <a href=\"http://www.abcolombia.org.uk/subpage.asp?subid=427&amp;mainid=75\" title=\"\">closest family and advisers have been linked to the murderous narco-paramilitary groups</a>.</p> <p>When I asked Santos a couple of months ago why Uribe <a href=\"http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/video-muestra-enojo-y-arremetida-de-uribe-contra-santos-via-twitter/20120519/nota/1691027.aspx\" title=\"\">keeps savaging him on Twitter</a> despite the fact that their signature policies seem so similar, his answer was revealing: \"I often ask myself the same question.\" From his economic and social policies \u2013 attract foreign skills and investment to expand natural resource exports to pay for social investments: the classic neoliberal package \u2013 to his attitude to the guerrillas, which he <a href=\"http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/paz/articulo-350574-mas-plomo-contra-farc-santos\" title=\"\">recently summarised as \"more lead\"</a>, he seems to be following where Uribe led. That is certainly how it looks to many of his critics on the left.</p> <p>But his drive to be modern and decent has imbued these policies with a subtle rebalancing. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18882551\" title=\"\">Recent pictures of indigenous people removing armed soldiers from their land</a> surprised the country \u2013 Uribe tweeted that this was a breakdown of law and order. But for some it demonstrated the difference between the two men. Where Uribe would probably have ordered the troops to fight back, Santos accepted a limited humiliation of the armed forces in the name of decency. I remember hearing the first radio announcements by the Santos government endorsing the importance of human rights defenders and thinking: \"Santos is going to be different.\" Uribe never lost an opportunity to harangue and undermine those working on human rights, often <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/02/05/letter-president-uribe-recent-statements-about-journalist-hollman-morris\" title=\"\">accusing them of complicity with terrorism</a>. Perhaps most blatantly, the diplomatic attitude Santos shows towards the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, despite his certainty that Ch\u00e1vez funded the Farc guerrillas, must deeply annoy Uribistas, demonstrating as it does a mature diplomatic approach to international politics.</p> <p>Lest this article be mistaken for a hagiography, let me make clear that everything is relative and that politics is often the art of the least-worst option. Santos still cares more about mining profits than the land rights of indigenous people and poor communities, and there is no sign whatsoever that the fundamentals that make Colombia one of the world's most unequal countries are being challenged \u2013 Santos's <a href=\"http://www.semana.com/nacion/santos-debe-pedir-perdon-fracaso-restitucion-engano-robledo/177914-3.aspx\" title=\"\">record on restoring land to victims of displacement is very weak</a>, despite a fairly progressive new law recognising victims' rights. While poverty is down again this year, rightly a source of pride to progressives in the government, it is still around the level it was 20 years ago \u2013 7 million Colombians live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>But it is Santos's reverence for modernity in a world of exciting new heterodox thinking that may serve his country best, even more so than his instinct for decency. When neoliberalism was modern, Santos believed and upheld it. But Santos is a liberal, not a neoliberal. Now that neoliberalism is in history's dustbin, it is highly likely that Santos will allow his politics to be strongly influenced by new currents of economic thought, particularly those emanating from Colombia's South American neighbours. It is no coincidence that Santos refers to Colombia's inequality in almost every speech he makes, now that it is fashionable to do so, <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/0,,contentMDK:20384897~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258554,00.html\" title=\"\">with the World Bank itself leading the charge</a>. <a href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/countries/americas/southamerica/colombia/premiumcontent/303760.html\" title=\"\">Santos's new home-building programme</a> is borrowed from Brazilian and Venezuelan success, as is his <a href=\"http://www.portafolio.co/economia/jovenes-pobres-no-estudian-no-trabajan-ni-buscan-empleo\" title=\"\">plan to pay poor young people to study</a>. Most crucially of all, if he decides to learn from the Brazilian experience of heavily investing in small farmers as a complement to mega-agroprojects, he could expect to see similar falls in hunger and poverty.</p> <p>I am even prepared to retune my critique of the <a href=\"http://www.anspe.gov.co/foro/inicio.aspx\" title=\"\">National Agency for Overcoming Extreme Poverty</a> (Anspe), which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/05/colombia-tackling-poverty-dent-statistics\" title=\"\">I wrote about a few months ago</a>. In May, I visited a woman for whom Anspe was the first serious contact with a poverty-focused state she has had in her lifetime (she was displaced to the outskirts of the city of Monter\u00eda, in northern Colombia, 30 years ago). Although oversold (an exit from poverty requires jobs, public services and infrastructure, not just visits from a social worker, as I said at a meeting with Anspe bosses afterwards), it is at least the first tentative step towards decent social security for the country's poorest inhabitants, and one initiated by Uribe, under whom official poverty figures also fell.</p> <p>These tweaks of an unjust system are not going to satisfy those who rightly continue to point to the grave human rights violations and land displacements, still unanswered for, which blight Colombia's polarised history. But if Santos has proved anything apart from his decency and modernity, it is that, like Brazil's ex-president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, he has the political nous to know the limits of the possible in a country where violence and elite power are still major factors in the political firmament.</p>"
