  "<p>Only a few hours have passed since the publication of Michael Heseltine's economic-rescue plan, but its likely fate can already be guessed at: it will become a purely political artefact. Lord Heseltine's report has already served its purpose for the coalition, by signalling how seriously it takes the need to stimulate an economy that has been flatlining for two years. George Osborne has already praised the work of his fellow Conservative as \"bursting with ideas\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/heseltine-report-blasts-coalition-growth\" title=\"\">The document, No Stone Unturned, comes in handy for Ed Miliband too</a>, who yesterday made great play of this verdict from the one-time president of the Board of Trade: \"The message I keep hearing is that the UK does not have a strategy for growth and wealth creation.\"</p> <p>So far, so routine. The greater disappointment from Lord Heseltine's analysis is how little it has to offer against what he correctly identifies as an existential economic crisis. This is not because the Conservative heavyweight lacks the ability to identify Britain's major problems \u2013 and, crucially, to frame them in terms appreciable to those on the right. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/lord-heseltine-older-politician-analysis\" title=\"\">The man who made his name in Toxteth</a>, who bequeathed London with the Jubilee line (and, less happily, the Millennium Dome), understands the need for productive cities. But experience and talent, however substantial, have in this government-commissioned report been badly let down by resources. So much is apparent from the off. Those reviews the government wishes to take seriously are first presented as serious pieces of work. Think of the way then-chancellor Gordon Brown handpicked economist Kate Barker to look into the housing market, or BA boss Rod Eddington to study transport needs. These were researched by civil servants, breathed over by special advisers and garnished with a ministerial foreword. However insipid their contents, these reports came with the imprimatur of Whitehall.</p> <p>Compare that with yesterday's publication from Lord Heseltine. Very little coverage of the document actually mentions the look of the thing, which is strange because it is very revealing. The cover of No Stone Unturned is <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/n/12-1213-no-stone-unturned-in-pursuit-of-growth.pdf\" title=\"\">a cartoon of the former conference darling himself shining a torchlight under a boulder</a>. There follows a portrait of the author's great hero Joseph Chamberlain and a first chapter titled One Man's Vision. The impression conveyed is not of Whitehall gravitas, but a pamphlet produced by an enthusiastic amateur. Sadly, this is borne out by what follows: a collection of other organisations' data coupled with a recounted Life and Times of Tarzan.</p> <p>Many ideas are often reheats of discarded Labour policies. Revivify local enterprise partnerships! By turning them into regional development authorities. Start a national growth council! Just like Mr Brown used to have. And so on. Nothing wrong there: it's just that these ideas do not go far enough.</p> <p>The great gamble made by Thatcher and Major and, with less conviction, by Blair and Brown was that if government provided a low-tax, light-regulation environment for business, private-sector jobs would follow. North of the Watford Gap, that hasn't happened. New Labour had to create public-sector jobs in Swansea, Newcastle and Merseyside to cover for the lack of private-enterprise employment.</p> <p>Successive administrations have commanded young people to go to university, only for them to find no commensurate job opportunities upon graduation. Meanwhile, London has hogged government attention and infrastructure spending \u2013 so that over the next few years Greater London will receive \u00a345.6bn in airport and rail capacity and other hard-helmet work: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/30/boris-spending-london-economic-woes\" title=\"\">more than Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put together</a>. The City got a historic bailout \u2013 even while this government refused to underwrite a small loan to Sheffield Forgemasters. Redressing this imbalance of power between one corner of Britain and the rest of the country will take more than a few committees and a pot of government spare change.</p>",
  "<p>The cyclists have been pedalling through the dusty outskirts of Yemen's capital, Sana'a, for just 30 seconds when the first rock comes hurtling at their wheels.</p> <p>None of the seven riders of Yemen's National Cycle Foundation so much as flinch, as the perpetrator, a local shopkeeper, identifies himself. He shouts and waves an arm. \"You gays! Cover up!\"</p> <p>Dressed in an eclectic assortment of sun-faded Lycra cycling attire, and riding an archaic selection of bikes in varying state of repair, the group keeps silent, and together, as they keep on pedalling.</p> <p>Yemen must be one of the few countries in the world where a group of young men, on their morning ride can, and regularly does, attract such anger and ignorance from passersby. Their crime? Wearing shorts and tight jerseys.</p> <p>As the riders approached the first steep climb, their coach, Saleh al-Riashi,&#xa0;emerges from the sunroof of an accompanying vehicle. He makes this trip three times a week, every week, with near-religious devotion, barking commands out of the car's roof, much like the director of a pro-team on the grand tour.</p> <p>It is inaccurate to describe the team as the national cycling team of Yemen, simply because they have lacked the resources to travel anywhere as a team since 2006.</p> <p>Riashi is the only member of the current team to have competed abroad. He says that when they arrived in Egypt in 2006 to compete in the Arab Club Championships, his Yemeni team were almost laughed off the starting line.</p> <p>\"Our bikes were probably 20 years old, and our clothes worn \u2026 but we soon showed we are serious racers \u2026 we finished sixth out of 13 teams and received an apology,\" he says.</p> <p>Riashi, who competed in the 2008 Tour of Sharjah, is now preparing his team for the next challenge, this year's Arab Club Championships, despite some key shortcomings. \"We are probably $2,000-$3,000 dollars short of money to even get our riders to the start line, beyond the problems with our equipment.\"</p> <p>Money, though, is probably the least of the team's worries ahead of the event, which is being held in the United Arab Emirates next month. Leading up the first climb is Yusuf al-Bandani, a skinny <em>grimpeur</em> (climber) who dances on the pedals of his steel bike like a champion from the late 1980s.</p> <p>The mountains surrounding Sana'a are almost Pyrenean in feel and as Bandani climbs by the bleached, jagged rocks, he could almost be on the famous Mont Ventoux stage of the Tour de France. The air is suitably thin, and as he makes the summit of the climb he is already more than 500&#xa0;metres higher than that French summit.</p> <p>It is the scars on the young man's arm that serve as a poignant reminder that he is actually training in Yemen's highlands. \"We had been preparing for ourselves for a regional competition, near Lahj, when an SUV started driving erratically near us.\"</p> <p>Lahj is not somewhere many cycls find themselves. It is the location of al-Anad airbase, which is home to a contingent of US troops and also a hotbed of insurgent activity. It is firmly in the middle of Yemen's wild tribal hinterland.</p> <p>\"We were riding along, when suddenly we were swept off our bikes by a man in a Toyota Landcruiser. Four of our riders were wiped out. We all needed stitches and one rider needed surgery on his arm,\" Bandani says with a matter-of-fact air and a shrug of his shoulders, as if being attacked and nearly killed for riding a bicycle is a normal daily occurrence. \"It's just simple ignorance.\"</p> <p>Sitting down for a post-training tea, Riashi is keen to explain his motivation for cycling, and his determination for Yemen to compete again, at least regionally. It takes him back to the country's civil war in 1994: \"In Yemen, every small kid has a bike and loves riding. I had to stay inside during the war, and came across the Tour de France on French satellite television. I was hooked on racing bikes from them on.</p> <p>\"Most families in Yemen watch the Tour de France on TV and it's extremely popular. My hero is Mark.\"</p> <p>The British sprinter Mark Cavendish is fast becoming a global cycling celebrity and superstar. \"No,\" says Riashi, using his hands to mime a bald head. \"Not Mark Cavendish.\"</p> <p>The group, sensing confusion, jump up in unison and begin to emulate the late Marco Pantani, climbing vigorously on sets of imaginary drop handlebars with his trademark shaved head.</p> <p>How a diminutive Italian <em>grimpeur</em>, famous for his tenacity in the mountains, became the inspiration for a squad of Yemeni cyclists is still slightly unclear. But if Riashi and his team want to make it to race in the UAE next month, they'll need all the Pantani attacking spirit they can muster.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Why the people are losing faith in politics, part 36. Let us consider the area of nuclear energy. \"[We will] \u2026 reject a new generation of nuclear power stations; based on the evidence nuclear is a far more expensive way of reducing carbon emissions than promoting energy conservation and renewable energy.\" That was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/14/liberal-democrat-manifesto-at-a-glance\" title=\"\">Liberal Democrat general election manifesto 2010</a>. \"In addition to posing safety and environmental risks, nuclear power will only be possible with vast taxpayer subsidies or a rigged market. People don't want nuclear, but they don't know what the alternatives are. Now they do, and the alternatives are cleaner, safer, greener and better for the environment and the taxpayer.\" That was Ed Davey, doing his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Silkwood\" title=\"\">Karen Silkwood</a> routine, part of the Lib Dems' \"<a href=\"http://andrew-simpson.org.uk/en/article/2006/033460/lib-dems-say-no-to-nuclear\" title=\"\">Say no to nuclear</a>\" campaign in 2006. And then there's \"New nuclear isn't only about keeping the lights on and emissions down, it's an industrial strategy with big potential wins.\" Davey again, on Tuesday, announcing the coalition's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/30/hitachi-next-generation-british-nuclear-plants\" title=\"\">new nuclear investment deal with Hitachi</a>. Without even the slightest embarrassment, apparently.</p> <p>\u2022 Great anticipation ahead of the <a href=\"http://www.stonewall.org.uk/what_you_can_do/events/2595.asp\" title=\"\">Stonewall awards</a> on Thursday evening. On one hand we have sponsors <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/barclays-and-coutts-threaten-to-withdraw-sponsorship-from-gay-rights-awards-unless-bigot-of-the-year-category-is-removed-8262133.html\" title=\"\">Barclays and Coutts threatening to walk away</a> if the charity persists with its highly popular award category Bigot of the Year. Stonewall says it surely will. On the other, we have one of the nominees, Christian activist Alan Craig \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.alansangle.com/?p=851\" title=\"\">who branded his critics the \"gaystapo\"</a>\u2013 complaining that, try as he might, he can't get a ticket. He has been in touch, he says, seeking \"details about their voting, when the count takes place and whether I can attend and speak at the award dinner as a nominee\". No answer thus far. \"These are reasonable accountability questions for a high-profile open event run by a registered and apparently responsible charity.\" The nomination wasn't supposed to be a badge of honour. But these are strange days.</p> <p>\u2022 The phone rings. The voice is recognisable. It is the MP Austin Mitchell. Now see here, he says, in that genial way. The 1989 Guardian cuttings file may endure, but I never said that \"In Grimsby we know a woman's place ... on her back on a kitchen table.\" What did you say back then, we asked him. \"I am pretty sure I said you people in the south think that in the north we say a woman's place is on her back.\" For he would not, he said, be daft enough to insult the females in his beloved constituency. That's logical. As for us in&#xa0;the south, we're fair game.</p> <p>\u2022 More from Spear's, the magazine for the super-wealthy, on how readers of \"high net worth\" might cope in this dangerous time of recession. Alongside advice about what to do if rioters invade your west London mansion, there is good news. Even the fashion-conscious can now wear a bulletproof vest. \"Fashion and technology have combined to make defensive garments not just lighter and safe but even somewhat stylish,\" it says. \"You'll need a little bit of spare shrapnel \u2013 at least \u00a35,000 \u2013 for your turn on the armour-plated catwalk, but it's cheaper than \u2013 well, dying.\" There are bulletproof dress shirts, blazers, polo shirts, raincoats. Everything is there to make the high net-worther feel just that bit safer. Mind you, they could just pay their full whack of tax instead.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, a word from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/08/swindon-leyton-orient-paolo-di-canio\" title=\"\">Paolo de Canio</a>, the controversial manager of Swindon Town. He is speaking on behalf of League Cup sponsors Capital One, the credit card company, and discusses with the Evening Standard's <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/biography/mihir-bose\" title=\"\">Mihir Bose</a> his thoughts on Benito Mussolini as \"basically a very principled ethical individual \u2026 deeply misunderstood\". I \"don't take everything from one regime. I am talking of leadership,\" says Paolo. \"It is in my book. I don't say I want fascism. These ideas, they begin to help people, the pensioners, to make new schools, build new cities for the people. That was good at the beginning. Then, at the end, everything went wrong for many reasons. I don't want go through it now because I am not a political person. I have friends who are black, Jewish.\" We get the drift, Paolo. At Swindon, we suppose, the training always runs on time.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>The last few days offer a salutary reminder of how a species that can seem to control everything is not in control of some very important things. There isn't much equivalence between the towering force of super-storm Sandy and the insidious progress of Chalara fraxinea, the fungal disease that threatens the UK's third most populous tree, but they have this much in common: both speak of the need to respect the natural world and the consequences of ignoring its fragility. We are overconfident in our own capacity to adapt and survive, and dangerously casual with the irreplaceable.</p> <p>When people fear for their jobs and livelihoods, worrying about woodlands and biodiversity might seem like self-indulgence. The management of the threat to the native ash of a lethal fungal infection first identified in Poland 20 years ago explains just why they matter. Forestry experts had long warned that climate change and the growth of plant imports could end up with more imported disease. But the attraction of plentiful plants and young trees from nurseries abroad outweighed such concern. The cost of such a disregard for biosecurity is what the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/uk-forests-unprecedented-threat-disease?CMP=twt_fd\" title=\"\">Forestry Commission is now calling</a> an \"unprecedented threat\" to some of Britain's most distinctive trees.</p> <p>Ash dieback is only the latest of a list that includes <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-8EJKP4\" title=\"\">Phytophthora ramorum</a>, another fungal infection that's destroying larches across Britain's west, and which may yet attack that symbol of Englishness, the oak. The prematurely dying leaves of chestnuts every late summer is a reminder of the inexorable spread of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/02/conservation.wildlife\" title=\"\">bleeding canker</a>, while unintentionally imported beetles, snails and moths <a href=\"http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/\" title=\"\">threaten fruit trees, pines and garden shrubs</a>. As an island, Britain has better natural defences than anywhere else in Europe, but complex EU trade law and a lack of political will militate against speedy reaction to new threats.</p> <p>We are already living with the consequences of earlier failures to give biosecurity the attention it needs. From the near past, a proper understanding of the extent of bovine TB would have made farmers more aware of the consequences of restocking with cattle from high-risk areas after <a href=\"http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/5541/\" title=\"\">the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001</a>. Eighteen months earlier, more consideration of the impact of an economic model that was based on ease of animal movement might have <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/273/1602/2729\" title=\"\">prevented the wildfire spread</a> of foot and mouth altogether.</p> <p>We cannot predict precisely the consequences of our casual assumption of&#xa0;man's limitless capacity to cope with environmental disaster. But it is plain that with each crisis, something is lost. Ash dieback merely threatens to be more highly visible than most. It should be recognised for the warning that it is: we are nature's custodians, not nature's masters.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here shortly. In the meantime, here's Jamie Jackson's match preview:</p> <blockquote> <p>Roberto Di Matteo and Sir Alex Ferguson will make significant changes to their Chelsea and Manchester United sides for Wednesday evening's Capital One Cup tie at Stamford Bridge, where they meet three days after their controversial Premier League game.</p> <p>United's 3-2 win in west London was followed by Chelsea's official complaint that Mark Clattenburg, the referee, had aimed allegedly \"inappropriate\" language at Juan Mata and Mikel John Obi, with the club claiming that the latter was the target of a racial slur. Clattenburg denies the allegations.</p> <p>Although Chris Smalling is not yet fit enough to be in contention, he should be available for United's Champions League trip to Braga next Wednesday after the groin and metatarsal injuries that have ruled him out so far this season. Smalling's fellow central defender Phil Jones is yet to return to football training as he recovers from a knee problem.</p> <p>Ferguson told MUTV: \"We will try to push Chris on quickly. I don't think he will make Wednesday's game but I am sure he will be ready for the following week. There was some hope both he and Phil would be back for this busy schedule. Phil will be starting football training next Monday. He still has some running to do. The good news is they are not far away.\"</p> <p>After the visit to Stamford Bridge, United host Arsenal in Saturday's early kick-off, then fly to Portugal for their Champions League group game before travelling to Aston Villa the following Saturday.</p> <p>With this busy 10 days in mind, Ferguson will rest key players at Stamford Bridge. \"Obviously we will make changes for the Wednesday game,\" he said. \"The squad that played against Newcastle [United, in the previous round] will be in place again. You don't want to lose down there and we want to continue in the cup. Any game down there is going to be tough. There has been good progress there since Roberto Di Matteo took the job. They are big games \u2013 and big games are good for us.\"</p> <p>For the 2\u20111 win over Newcastle in late September, Ferguson handed full debuts to Michael Keane, Marnick Vermijl and Scott Wootton in a side completely different from United's previous outing, a 2-1 win at Liverpool.</p> <p>Di Matteo's challenge is to try to ensure his side retain focus following Sunday's post-match events. Although Mata and Mikel are in the match-day squad, the manager may elect to rest both. Di Matteo is also without the suspended John Terry, Fernando Torres and Branislav Ivanovic, and the injured Frank Lampard.</p> <p>\"We are looking to freshen the team up a little bit, for sure, and also put a couple of youngsters in,\" Di Matteo said. \"We always talk about developing and giving youngsters a chance so this type of game is a good opportunity for some of them.\"</p> <p>Daniel Sturridge, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta and Lucas Piaz\u00f3n look certain to start. They could be joined by Victor Moses, Marko Marin, Oriol Romeu and Ryan Bertrand.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><br>If the last few days of Circus Football have taught us anything, it is that there is no point previewing matches. You could publish 45 mighty leather-clad volumes discussing facts, form and scenarios ahead of tonight's big game \u2013 and Chelsea and Manchester United could still contrive to serve up something you hadn't thought possible. Barmy errors, outrageous skill, breakneck attacking, inexplicable decisions, phenomenal comebacks, hilarious celebrations, racist storms, chauvinist showers, friendly whirlpools \u2013 we could get all or none of these tonight, and plenty more besides. Brace yourselves. </p> <p>Or, of course, we could get a torpid 0-0 draw, though even then we would still savour the drama of a penalty shoot-out because, as Olivier Giroud and Francis Coquelin now know, there are no replays in this here competition. There'll be treats tonight, then, and possibly lots to tricks too. </p> <p>Here is tonight's cast:</p> <p><strong>Chelsea:</strong> Cech, Azpilicueta, Cahill, Luiz, Bertrand, Romeu, Mikel, Moses, Mata, Piazon, Sturridge </p> <p><strong>United:</strong> Lindgaard, Rafael, Keane, Wooton, Buttner, Giggs, Anderson, Fletcher, Nani, Hernandez, Wellbeck </p> <p><strong>Person hoping this is the mention he gets:</strong> Lee Mason</p> <p><strong>Some footballers who should be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfxh_79HiQY\">playing tonight</a>:</strong> John Hellins, Peter Gorey, Paranormal Whiteside and ... you can do better, can't you? </p> <p>Before the game, let's all take a moment to laugh at Nails McCluskey, an Arsenal-crazed chum of mine \u2026. who missed last night's extravaganza at the Madejski because he locked himself in a car park. It is right and just to bring this to wider attention.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>7.42pm: United fans have just unfurled a large banner reading: \"Clattenberg, Referee, Leader, Legend\". There'll be needle in this game and no mistake. Meanwhile, Ally Fogg recommends \"Andy Witchie\" as a participant in tonight's proceedings.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> And they're off: and at a cracking pace to boot. The United fans are belting chants about John Terry which, alas, cannot be repeated here for legal reasons and so on.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> United have settled quicker, looking more comfortable with the high tempo. Even Andersen has just accelerated past Mikel ... before being curtailed by David Luiz, who launches a counter-attack and then, since no one comes to challenge him, decides to unleash the game's first shot. He wellies it way over from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Fletcher gives the ball away to Sturridge, who tears towards the Chelsea backline ... but then loses his cool and attempts a rash pass to Mata. Interception. \"How about Jurgen Pumpkinsmann?\" howls Gary Naylor. \"Actually, that's terrible, isn't it?\" Yes, it is, Gary, but perhaps its very ghastliness makes it the most appropriate suggestion of all?</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> There's only one thing to say about what has just happened: hahahahahahahahahaha! You see, Moses found Sturridge with a wonderful pass from the right and the striker, having eluded the United defence, took it down 15 yards from goal ... and then fell over! \"Are you Torres in disguise?\" crow the United fans. It really was that bad.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> It's pleasingly helter-skelter. THe quality is not especially high so far but you can feel that the stakes are. Meanwhile, Eddie Munro recommends two more United legends who could do with an outing tonight: \"Neal Webb and Jonathan Spectre.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> The first booking of the game goes to Romeu, for a lazy trip on Buttner. In other news, I'm glad so many emailers picked up on the fact that Andy Witchie played for United. Just, um, making sure you're paying attention. \"Instead of Keey Dixon, how about Scary Vixen?\" contorts Justin Kavanagh. \"He would surely be a bewitching striker for Chelsea. Especially in that all-black Chelsea away strip.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Decent interplay betwene MOses and Azpilicueta down the right before the Nigerian is penalised for being blocked off by Welbeck, which seems harsh. \"Here's one: Mark FrankenStein,\" bellows Huw Alexander. \"I'll get my broomstick.\"</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Easy save for Cech from a Welbeck shot from 16 yards. United, though, still look marginally more dangerous than the hosts.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> A foxy flick from Bertrand, followed by another by Sturridge and suddenly Moses is racing into the box with only Wooton to beat ... and then he too falls over! Has someone put a hex on Chelsea's players? \"How about Fright Yorke partnering Andy Ghoul, against Dan Ceausescu and Mario Satani\u0107?\" Top marks to G Ujang.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Romeu, who is already on a yellow, concedes a freekick by tripping Nani about 30 yards from goal. If he were daring the ref to send him off, that's pretty much how he'd go about it. Lee Mason decides to be lenient.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 0-1 United (Giggs 22')</strong> The farce begins! Cech rolls a short goalkick to Romeu on the edge of the area. Giggs and Andersen immediately converge on the midfielder, who coughs up the ball to allow Giggs to rifle it into the net from 18 yards!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Chelsea fans vent their derision at the ref after he waves play on when Piazon is shunted to the ground on the edge of the United box by Rafael.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Mikel is booked for a late trip on Welbeck. It was a thoroughly justified decision but such is the ire of the locals that they immediately begin bellowing \"You're worse than Clattenberg\". They sure know how to endear themselves to officials down at the Bridge.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Splendid skill by Welbeck on the left, dinking the ball over one opponents and then reverse-flicking it past another. He really is a deceptively fine player.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Penalty! An easy decision for Mason as Buttner clatters into the impressive Moses, who was making another burst into the box.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 1-1 United (David Luiz pen, 31')</strong> Spot-on spotkick from the Brazilian, who hammered the ball low and hard into the corner. Lindegaard went the right way and got a touch to it but the shot was struck with too much power for him to stop it.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Mikel flights a long ball over the top. Sturridge again gets away from the United defence to collect it ... and then shows a distinct lack of composure to smash the ball wildly into the stands. He had time and space to do virtually anything but instead demonstrated that his decision-making is seriously in need of improvement. Meanwhile, here's another Halloween footballer: \"Dark Mata?\" proposes the cosmic-minded J Kadlard</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> The ref orders a short break in play for reasons that Sky do not want to tell us about: the fact that some stewards at the United end are looking quite agitated suggests there may be some manner of mayhem afoot ... in fact, there are now claims on twitter that fireworks were thrown. Let's hope nothing more sinister develops.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Order appears to have been restored in the stands, and play resumes, with Welbeck firing in another shot from 20 yards. But again it was not good enough to trouble Cech.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> David Luiz, for once eschewing the complicated, smashes the ball miles out of play as Hernandez closed in on him. \"It's less fun than riffing on Halloween puns (Rafae-Hell?), but surely Buttner's immediate finger wagging denial of a clear penalty is trying to con the ref in exactly the same way that divers are trying to con the ref?\" Matt Dony, who may not have a firm grasp of the meaning of 'exactly' but has a point all the same. \"Where's the high-horse brigade on that?\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 1-2 United (Hernandez 42')</strong> This time David Luiz spurned the straight-forward ... and coughed up possession on the half-way line. United punished him emphatically, with Hernandez showcasing his lethal predatory skills again, taking Nani's pass with one sure touch before firing past Cech from the edge of the box. Give him an inch and he'll take a goal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> Moses again rips down the right and delivers a cross that United divert behind for a corner. But it comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> It's been frantic. Two Halloween howlers have helped United take the lead but Chelsea have flickered - notably through Moses - and there's plenty of sparks left in this one. \"Regarding Matt Dony's point [39 mins],\" blurts Rob Edwards. \"Does he mean exactly the same way in which every player in the Premier League ever claims for a throw in? It's a CHEATING EPIDEMIC I TELL YOU!\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Substitutions: </strong>Powell is on for United instead of Buttner (apparently because he has picked up a knock, and not, then, because he was being given the run-around by Moses), so Rafael is going to left-back and Fletcher will try his luck at right-back. Chelsea, meanwhile, have replaced Mikel with Ramires.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Powell makes an immediate impression, collecting a ball from Anderson about 25 yards out, then making space for a shot and tonking in a low swirler that Cech pushes awkwardly behind for a corner.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Sturridge, Sturridge, Sturridge! Usually he is too hasty but this time, after being put through by Mata, he was guilty of taking far too long to do anything useful, leisurely trying to manouevre the ball on to his left so that he could pick his spot from eight yards. United got back to stick the ball out for a corner; then they dawdled as Chelsea took a quick one ... and now Sturridge was back to his usual rashness, attempting an extravagant flick from six yards when he had enough time to control the ball and bang it into the net. At this rate, Torres will remain the most effective striker at Stamford Bridge, which is alarming. \"Twitter claims that some United fans are flying the banner 'Chelsea - standing up to racism since last Sunday',\" notes Peter McMurry. \"Please, please tell me this is true.\" I've not seen it, Peter, my vantage point in a bunker several miles from the stadium restricting my view to what Sky want to show me.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2-2 United (Cahill 51')</strong> Perhaps Chelsea should stick Cahill up front instead of Torres and Sturridge? That's his fifth goal of the season, coming courtesy of a powerful header from a corner. Rafael tried to keep it out but he was behind the line when he connected with it and the referee rightly awarded the goal.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Chelsea substitution: </strong>Piazon off, Hazard on.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Mata and Hazard combine in familiar fashion before the Belgian slips the ball through to the overlapping Bertrand. Lindegaard dives to cut out his dangerous low cross.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2-3 United (Nani 59')</strong> A beautiful goal, created and converted by Nani! The Portuguese winger initiated a counter-attack with some flamboyant skill in his own half and then arrived at the end of the move to swap a slick one-two with Hernandez and then dink the ball over the out-rushing Cech.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Play is hurtling from one end to the other and at this point you would not totally rule out a repeat of last night's 12-goal fiesta at the Madejski. Hernandez, in fact, should have added the sixth of the game after being teed up just now by Anderson, but he smashed the ball over from the edge of the box. Give him an inch, and he might take a goal, then. \"<a href=\"http://www.balls.ie/football/another-man-united-banner-attacking-chelsea/#sthash.f9c0vzOA.X0YY7lDQ.dpbs\">Here's a picture of that banner</a> for Peter mcMurry,\" offers friendly Liam Godinho.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Wootton booked for clonking into Sturridge on half-way.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Azpilicueta, who has shown tremendous enterprise from right-back, plays a snappy one-two with Mata before a shot is deflected out for a corner. Chelsea take it short and then cross towards the penalty spot, where Moses heads inches over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Chelsea play their way from back to front with sweet passing and movement, and then Ramires goes and bogs the ball way wide from 20 yards. Meanwhile, for those who care, Gareth Bale has put Spurs 1-0 up at Norwich, while Swansea lead by the same score at Anfield thanks to Chico.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> A great chance missed! Mata jinked his way to the by-line and then clipped the ball to the back post, where Azpilicueta arrived at speed .... and headed over!</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> The League Cup matters to Roberto Di Matteo: he proves that by withdrawing Romeu and throwing on Oscar, meanign the Tricky Trio is now intact.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Chelsea cry for a penalty but the ref turns them down! The ball clearly hit the defender's arm from Mata's attempted shot but the official seemingly ruled that it was inadvertent. We'll get a replay if there is a break in play, which could be a while given how fast this match is careering from one end to the other...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Oscar lets fly from from 20 yards and the ball goes high and wide, which gives u a chance to have another look at the penalty appeal: sure enough, Mata's shot hit Keane's arm, which was positioned in a way that made that outcome probable.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Another fine move by Chelsea, who are chasing the equaliser with giddy abandon. Bertrand plays in Sturridge, who cuts it back for Moses, who lashes a low shot at goal from 12 yards .... well held by Linedegaard.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> A wayward pass by Sturridge allows United to relieve pressure and raid forward. When they get there, Giggs shows the sort of composure that Sturridge badly lacks and slows play down. United circulate the ball at their leisure ... before Anderson attempts to thread a cunning pass through to Welbeck. Cahill just gets a toe to it to abort the danger.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> After Welbeck narrowly fails to meet a Rafael cross, United make another change, taking off Anderson, who has had a fine game, and introducing Tunnicliffe.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> A little shuffle from Hazard fools Wootton, who blunders into the Belgian to concede a freekick about three yards outside the box (but Wootton avoids a second booking). Mata curls a reasonable effort over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> United are having to resist a gathering storm; Lindegaard makes another save, this time from Sturridge following a slinky backheel tee-up by Hazard.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Lovely effort by Oscar, well parried by Lindegaard. With a quick shimmy the Brazilian made room for a shot and then dispatched a swirler from 25 yards, but the keeper kept his focus and batted it away. Meanwhile, Norwich have equalised against Spurs thanks to an own goal by Vertonghen.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Chelsea keep coming. And they keep missing, this time Cahill booming over after decent work by Oscar. Meanwhile at Carrow Road, Simeon Jackson has put Norwich 2-1 up against Spurs.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> \"Time to blame the referee!\" chant the traveling fans.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Tunnicliffe throws himself in front of a Mata shot to preserve his team's lead. But Chelsea regain possession and come again.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be at least three more minutes, which, if last night is anything to go by, could mean anything. At Anfield, meanwhile, there is unlikely to be extra-time as Nathan Dyer has put Swansea 2-0 up. It really is looking like a good night for United fans ...</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> David Luiz booked for showing excessive zeal - or downright ineptitude - in his attempt to dispossess Hernandez.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Penalty! With the ball bouncing aroudn the United box, Ramires seemed set to spin and shoot ... but Wootton barged him over!</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 3-3 United (Hazard pen, 90+4')</strong> It was never going to end on time, was it? Hazard coolly strokes the ball down the middle as Lindegaard flops to his left. Cue extra-time (during which United will have 11 men, as Wootton again escapes a second yellow).</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>ET 1:</strong> The show continues. Chelsea zip the ball around nicely for the first minute. With the momentum in their favour and most of their first-team on the pitch, the home side must be favourites to prevail here. But you'd be a fool to bet on that.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>ET 3 min:</strong> Apparently all this excitement is too much for my email system, which has now crashed. So don't bother sending me anything, unless it's abuse, of which you can spew as much as you want while I can't read it. In other news, Sturridge's decision-making is not improving: after beating Lindegaard to a through-ball, he could have crossed to a team-mate in the centre who would have had a great chance to score, but instead he went for a shot himself from a preposterous angle. You know how that story ended.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>ET 5 min:</strong> Federico Macheda is still at Manchester United. I know this because the camera has just shown him warming up. Looks like he's going to replace Welbeck, who seems to be in some discomfort.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 4-3 United (Sturridge ET 7')</strong> Give him 10 chances and he'll make you pay! A botched back-header by Wootton presented the ball to Sturridge and this time the striker finished with class, putting the keeper down with a sly feint and then rolling the ball into the net. Chelsea are in front for the first time.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>ET 9 min:</strong> A skirmish breaks out between Oscar and Nani, featuring all the classic ingredients of a football fight: shoving, stropping and general half-arsery. The ref rightly books them both.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>ET 11 min:</strong> Giggs, still going strong in the 100th minute and his 100th year, chases back to dispossess Mata just as the Spaniard shaped to shoot. United tear forward but the move founders on Macheda.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>ET 13 min:</strong> Cahill the Goal Machine malfunctions, flashing a header narrowly wide from a Mata freekick. Elsehwere, De Guzman has made it 3-1 to Swansea at Anfield. The holders are about to be chucked out.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>ET 15 min:</strong> Keane booked for pulling over Sturridge as the striker broke clear. Why that wasn't a red card I don't know. Chelsea will attempt to dispense justice from a freekick ... and it's a quite brilliant effort from David Luiz! He sent a freakish wobbler over the ball and it crashes against the crossbar! And that's the last kick of the first half of extra-time.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>ET 17 min:</strong> Chelsea launch a lightning break, which concludes with Sturridge thundering a shot fractionally over the bar from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>ET 19 min:</strong> Chelsea stream forward again. Sturridge takes the wrong option again, sending an ill-advised shot high and wide when well-placed team-mates were soliciting a pass.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>ET 21 min:</strong> Tunnicliffe catches Sturridhe-itis and goes for a flash volley from the edge of the area. Way, way over it goes.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>ET 22 min:</strong> Moses spurns a chance to kill United off! Sturridge, it should be noted, set up the opportunity with a well-chosen and well-executed pass, then Moses took it down and fired at goal from 12 yards. But Lindegaard scrambled it away with his feet.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>ET 24 min:</strong> Ramires sees yellow after a lunge on Keane.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 5-3 United (Ramires ET 25')</strong> Chelsea cleared a Giggs corner and suddenly launched forward through Hazard, who played in Ramires and the Brazilian finished beautifully. With a shuffle he laid down Lindegaard and then walked past him and slotted the ball into the net. That should settle it.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>ET 28 min:</strong> Giggs gets yellow for a frustrated boot at Moses.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>ET 29 min:</strong> Penalty to United! Perhaps things aren't settled! It was the right decision again by the ref, Azpilicueta having clumped into Hernandez.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 5-4 United (Giggs pen ET 29')</strong> Giggs sends Cech the wrong way to score and set up who knows what.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>ET 30 min:</strong> There will be at least two more minutes.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> The mayhem end, Hazard hitting the post with the last kick of an exhilarating game. Ultimately the introduction of Hazard, Oscar and Ramires turned the game in Chelsea's favour, giving them too much quality for an under-strength United side who nonetheless contributed largely to a delightfully entertaining game. Not too sure what the point of the League Cup is but it's proving great fun ... which, of course, should be the only point that matters.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Heseltine's <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/n/12-1213-no-stone-unturned-in-pursuit-of-growth.pdf\" title=\"\">report on growth</a> yesterday brought a bright shaft of old-time star quality back to the all-too-grey autumn political scene. There's a real temptation, especially for those of us who wrote about him in his prime, to get all&#xa0;nostalgic about Hezza.</p> <p>But it is a temptation that should be resisted. So no Tarzan metaphors from me this time around. Nothing about the hair. Nothing about Westland. Nothing about Liverpool. Nothing about a great speech I once heard him make at the Chesterfield byelection nearly 30 years ago. What matters is whether Heseltine is right about today's problems and whether the coalition is willing or likely to listen to his many messages.</p> <p>Parts of what Heseltine says has been said by others, some of it by Labour. But&#xa0;it has not been said better. The way he makes his case is a tonic. Yes, there is&#xa0;always a recklessness about Heseltine. It is why he remains the greatest of the modern might-have-beens. But he is so clearly right about the big things. And that is what counts.</p> <p>Heseltine recognises that this economic crisis is different from the others that postwar Britain has experienced. He is right that we are living through the&#xa0;start of a large shift in global economic power that will shape our future options more than many have yet realised. And he defines the economic and political terrain of the next decade in ways that simply cannot be ignored by any politician or policy maker wishing to be taken seriously.</p> <p>He is also right to say that excessive borrowing constrains the ability of the public sector to carry the weight of a viable growth strategy. A growth strategy is also largely a private-sector strategy \u2013 another pill that is hard for some to swallow. But at the core of Heseltinism, today as in the past, is an active embrace of the role of government in stimulating and channelling that private-sector growth. The most famous thing that Heseltine ever said was that he would \"intervene before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner\". It was also where he was truest to himself \u2013 and where he was right.</p> <p>Heseltine is too practised a political operator to allow himself to be manoeuvred into the role of opposition ringleader. Anyone listening to any of his many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/oct/31/lord-heseltine-money-cities-growth-video\" title=\"\">interviews and speeches</a> in the past 24 hours will have seen the old ringcraft delightfully intact.</p> <p>But there is no getting away from the&#xa0;truth on which Labour seized yesterday. Heseltine believes \u2013 is right to believe \u2013 that the UK needs an industrial strategy. The government is equivocal. So when Heseltine says that continuing as we are is not an option, or when he says that the UK lacks a growth and wealth creation strategy, all the ringcraft in Christendom cannot disguise the fact that he is saying the government is on the wrong course.</p> <p>If this is Heseltine's single most important criticism of government, it is&#xa0;far from being his only one. His report&#xa0;ranges wide, characteristically. It slices through the Whitehall turf war between the business department and the Home Office over immigration controls, making it clear that Heseltine believes that a country that declares itself open for business cannot at the same time be closed to people, especially if it takes its skills strategy seriously. Vince Cable will be quietly cheering that. Theresa May will seethe.</p> <p>Nor is Heseltine any great respecter of Eric Pickles's localism agenda, which routinely seems to take back with one hand what it gives with the other. Heseltine waxes lyrical about Victorian cities. His report has a portrait of Joseph Chamberlain on its opening page, and Hezza pointedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/oct/31/michael-heseltine-plan-h\" title=\"\">launched his plan</a> in Chamberlain's Birmingham yesterday. His localist vision is nothing if not bold. He wants to reverse the drift of power and money to \"London and its bureaucracies\" and he wants to transform local authorities from service providers into promoters of economic development.</p> <p>Not even Heseltine in all his enthusiasm thinks this is going to happen any time soon, or maybe any time at all, but&#xa0;the determination is exhilarating. And so is the cultural radicalism. Heseltine isn't just in favour of localism because it feels more connected and democratic. He's in favour of it because he has a job for it to do.</p> <p>Anyone who pines for a reinvigoration of civic England as part of the rethinking of the UK in the new British political landscape created by devolution to Scotland and Wales has an important ally in Heseltine.</p> <p>Chamberlain, though, was a lot more than a municipal innovator. He saw himself as a big political strategist too. And there is an echo of his later political career in Heseltine's politically charged proposal for government to police foreign takeovers of British companies so that they benefit the industrial strategy.</p> <p>It's a reminder that, just as Chamberlain turned to imperial preference to protect UK industry, so Heseltine's lifelong support for the European Union has had a similar industrial logic too.</p> <p>But will any of it happen? David Cameron sounded enthusiastic but unspecific yesterday. The Treasury will hate the report. But that doesn't mean that the whole thing is heading for the long grass. The Heseltine report will not suddenly become the coalition's book of the year. But there's a lot in it that a coalition in search of a more substantial growth strategy can run with.</p> <p>They would certainly be smart to do&#xa0;so. Heseltine is not promoting wacky&#xa0;new ideas in this report. He is promoting ideas with deep Tory roots \u2014 not just in Chamberlain but in RA Butler's important but now largely forgotten <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Charter\" title=\"\">industrial charter</a> of the postwar era, and beyond that in the Tory tradition of Bolingbroke and Disraeli, with their belief that the state must act in the interests of the many. But he is also promoting mainstream ideas about the&#xa0;role of government in industry which are commonplace in other advanced industrial nations, not just in Europe but also in the US.</p> <p>It is impossible to read Heseltine's report and not be struck by the autobiographical quality of his writing. At times it is as though he is telling the story of a road not travelled by postwar Britain, a road along which a Heseltine premiership might have led us. The country would have been a better place if that had happened. But the road is still there if we want it and, as Heseltine puts it with potent clarity, we are still the ones&#xa0;out of step in not taking it.</p>",
  "<p>At the core of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\" title=\"\">John Hayes intervention on wind turbines</a> was his claim that \"even if a minority of [the onshore wind] in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 target [on renewable energy, to provide 15% of UK energy from renewable sources]\".</p> <p>UK wind energy statistics seem to support this. In its renewables roadmap, the government predicts that onshore wind could provide up to 13GW of peak capacity by 2020.</p> <p>On current trends, that figure will be comfortably exceeded. The UK already has 5GW of onshore wind in addition to 2.1GW under construction, 3.9GW with consent and 7.4GW in planning.</p> <p>These figures suggest that only 27% of what is in planning needs to be built to meet the projection \u2013 which should be easily achievable, given that consents for wind farms over the past year are at record highs, according to the trade body RenewableUK.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/31/uk-stop-building-windfarms-renewable-targets\" title=\"\">13GW figure for wind is only a projection, not a target or cap</a>. Ed Davey emphasised this in his clarification on Wednesday, stating: \"There are no targets \u2013 or caps \u2013 for individual renewable technologies such as onshore wind.\" This is important because it means that if the projections for onshore wind are exceeded that will create slack in other areas such as offshore wind, marine energy, biomass and solar, all of which are included in the 2020 renewables target.</p> <p>If the UK ends up with more onshore wind and less of other renewable energy sources, that will save money. A series of recent reports have shown that onshore wind turbines are far cheaper than other mature renewable power sources \u2013 and indeed cheaper than nuclear. (Wind is still more expensive than gas, but the gap is closing.) It implies that the more onshore wind is built, the lower the overall bill.</p> <p>The other key question is how the slowdown or speed-up of onshore wind technologies will affect the UK's ability to hit its carbon targets \u2013 including the long-term goal of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050, relative to 1990 levels.</p> <p>The latest report from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government's independent advisers, assumes that onshore wind will scale up to 15GW by 2020, which the current figures suggest should be achievable.</p> <p>But the CCC argues that while \"the project pipeline \u2026 is healthy for wind, major challenges remain translating this to actual investments. These include ensuring \u2026 adequate financial support and financing for investments and that onshore wind projects receive planning approval\".</p> <p>The CCC argues that the planning process must reflect the benefits of onshore wind \"in order to avoid higher levels of investment in more expensive technologies that would have adverse affordability impacts\". It notes that \"onshore wind could be as little as half the cost of offshore wind\".</p>",
  "<p>Your report on the World Oncology Forum paints a rather gloomy picture (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/30/breast-cancer-screenings-damaging-women?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Cancer fight stalls amid push for profits, doctors say</a>, 29 October). You suggest new targeted therapies are failing to deliver on expectations and likely to be too expensive to have the anticipated impact on survival rates. As a delegate, I don't accept that pessimistic view nor do I believe we should be choosing between developing new medicines and addressing the global inequalities in cancer care. We need to do both.</p> <p>There is no question that the drug resistance many tumours develop is a major challenge. Not all targeted cancer therapies have been successful, but drugs like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib\" title=\"\">Glivec</a> and <a href=\"http://www.herceptin.com/\" title=\"\">Herceptin</a> have delivered great benefits to patients and shown what is possible. You cite the resistance melanomas develop to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vemurafenib\" title=\"\">Vemurafenib</a>, but it still represents a major success for bench-to-bedside research, and a significant step forward on the treatment options we had before. The potential to use targeted cancer drugs in combination, as we do with HIV, offers huge promise for the future. But the focus of the forum was on how we could tackle the huge and unacceptable disparities in cancer survival rates across the world.</p> <p>It is distressing to all of us that in Africa only 10% of children with curable childhood cancers live to adulthood, and also that increasing tobacco consumption in the developing world is fuelling a future cancer epidemic. The forum's decision to draw up a 10-point action plan to tackle global disparities in outcomes was a recognition that much needs to be done to provide equal access to existing treatments, but certainly wasn't intended to imply that drug discovery and development are failing. Indeed, I hope part of the 10-point plan will be a commitment among researchers and policy-makers to work in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure both current and future cancer medicines are affordable across the developed and developing world.<br><a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerandresearch/ourcurrentresearch/researchbygrantee/prof-stan-kaye\" title=\"\"><strong>Professor Stan Kaye</strong></a><br><em>Head of clinical studies, Institute of Cancer Research, London</em></p>",
  "<p>Investment in renewable power worth tens of billions of pounds to the UK economy, capable of creating thousands of new jobs, has been thrown into doubt by another coalition dispute over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy\" title=\"\">energy policy</a>, ignited by the Tory energy minister's rejection of new windfarm developments.</p> <p>David Cameron was forced to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\" title=\"\">intervene</a> on Wednesday by insisting that the coalition's energy policy was intact, despite remarks by his newly appointed minister that suggested an abrupt end to new onshore wind turbine construction \u2013 contradicting the government's supposed support for renewables.</p> <p>John Hayes, who took up the post of energy minister in the September reshuffle, said the countryside was already \"peppered\" with turbines; enough were planned and had been constructed to meet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/31/uk-stop-building-windfarms-renewable-targets\" title=\"\">government targets</a>.</p> <p>His remarks came just days ahead of the planned Commons debate on the government's energy bill, which sets out cuts in subsidies for wind power and which now may have to be postponed from next Monday until later in the month.</p> <p>Investors, renewable energy companies and wind power experts condemned the energy minister's remarks.</p> <p>\"This is very damaging,\" said Penny Shepherd, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. \"Investors want predictability of policy, they want to see government support. Multinational investors will look around the globe and ask, 'Who can we trust?' [This is a] very negative signal.\"</p> <p>The row erupted over remarks made by Hayes, a rightwing Tory, to the Daily Mail before a speech he was due to make before 5,000 delegates at the RenewableUK wind conference in Glasgow on Tuesday night. In the prepared speech he appeared to herald the end of onshore windfarm developments, saying, \"Enough is enough.\"</p> <p>But Ed Davey, the energy and climate secretary, instructed Hayes to tear up the speech, so that when the minister stood up to talk, he had to apologise to his audience for having no prepared remarks and speaking \"off the cuff\".</p> <p>But, unknown to Davey, the damage had been done as Hayes had briefed the Daily Mail ahead of the conference.</p> <p>Hayes' message was also markedly different from an interview he gave the Guardian on Monday, in which he praised onshore windfarms that had local support.</p> <p>Davey issued a very public slapdown to his Tory number two: \"There has been no change to government policy on renewable energy. As collectively agreed by the cabinet \u2026 [onshore wind] has an important role to play in our energy future.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, a spokesman said the energy minister still had the full support of the prime minister, and Cameron suggested that a review of local communities' acceptance of windfarms, which includes the cost of the technology, could trigger a rethink of government support once the 2020 target was met.</p> <p>\"All parties are going to have to debate what will happen once those targets are met,\" he said at prime minister's questions.</p> <p>In a third twist, Davey's department then insisted that the review was not expected to find any big drop in costs, so would not trigger a drop in subsidies.</p> <p>\"This might be the policy the Tory party wish they had, but they haven't; this is a coalition,\" said a source close to Davey.</p> <p>More than 10 multinational firms are considering big investments in the UK's low-carbon energy sector, amounting to tens of billions of pounds.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/26/wind-energy-fears-government-commitment?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Guardian revealed this year</a>, the companies have already been unsettled by a perceived ambivalence on the government's part towards green energy.</p> <p>The firms include General Electric, one of the world's biggest companies, which is considering a wind turbine manufacturing plant in the north of England, the German company Siemens, the Spanish wind-turbine manufacturer Gamesa, and Japan's Mitsubishi.</p> <p>Matt Partridge, development director at REG Wind Power, said: \"We are on the cusp of either achieving [tens of billions of pounds] in investment or blowing it. These deeply troubling comments are a huge disappointment.\"</p> <p>Dale Vince, founder of the green energy company Ecotricity, said: \"It is a disaster for investors.\" Onshore wind was one of the cheapest forms of energy, adding only about \u00a35 to household bills, while fossil fuels added about \u00a3120, he added.</p> <p>Vince called Hayes's opposition to wind \"ideological\" and a stance not based on fact or economics. \"David Cameron should not have allowed this energy minister to be appointed in the first place. This is a problem of his own creation.\"</p> <p>Maf Smith, deputy CEO of the trade body RenewableUK, said: \"We are on the eve of the publication of the energy bill, a crucial time for energy policy, with huge investment decisions to be made that will lead to tens of thousands of jobs over the next decade. If we are to see these jobs and investment realised, confidence must be retained. And that means consistency.\"</p> <p>A participant at the RenewableUK conference said it was unbelievable that at a time when the UK was showcasing its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy\" title=\"\">renewable energy</a> industry to overseas investors, at the biggest renewable energy event of the year, the government should be trying to sabotage the industry.</p> <p>\"How does this look to the people who are thinking of putting money in the UK?\" the person said.</p> <p>Renewable energy has become an increasingly sore point for the coalition, with rightwing Tories seizing on it as a \"wedge\" issue, despite evidence showing that the sector is helping to cut energy prices and create jobs.</p> <p>This year more than 100 Tories wrote to the prime minister urging him to cease backing onshore wind, and the chancellor, George Osborne, has repeatedly attacked renewable energy subsidies while leading calls for a \"dash for gas\".</p> <p>Ministers were relieved on Tuesday when the Japanese nuclear company Hitachi stepped in to buy the nuclear consortium Horizon, which had previously failed to find a bidder.</p> <p>Michael Heseltine, the former Tory minister, published on Wednesday a damning report on the government's failure to create growth, in which he targeted energy policy and other infrastructure.</p> <p>He said the government needed to set out a \"definitive and unambiguous energy policy, including the supporting financial regime, to give the sector the certainty to invest\". He also commended the importance of wind energy to deprived regions such as England's north-east region.</p> <p>Experts and investors called on Cameron to take a lead, and said the appearance of deep rifts over energy policy within the coalition was unsettling.</p> <p>Tony Whitehead, director of policy at the Institution of Engineering and Technology, said: \"The large investment and long time-scales involved in all types of energy generation need consistent, long-term, energy policies.</p> <p>\"Short-term uncertainty around UK energy policy, as we have seen in the last couple of days, is very unhelpful and has the potential to result in increased prices for consumers and delay much needed investment in all forms of energy infrastructure.</p> <p>\"It can also stop investment in new UK jobs. Remarks about wind power also affect gas, nuclear and other investments.\"</p>",

Women appointed at the highest levels of office, from the supreme court to the state department, expanded access to birth control and healthcare and protections against workplace inequities.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we have a pretty good idea of what a Romney presidency will be like for us as well. The former governor of Massachusetts has said he would remove <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/\" title=\"\">Planned Parenthood</a>'s funding and overturn the supreme court case that legalised abortion. His stance on pay equity \u2013 make sure women can get home in time to cook dinner for their families. This is to say nothing of marriage equality, help for low-income Americans, or gender roles (Romney says one parent should stay at home with children \u2013 not hard to imagine which one he means).</p> <p>It's not hyperbole to say that women's lives hang in the balance. Romney has promised to reinstate the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/23/barack-obama-foreign-abortion-aid\" title=\"\">global gag rule</a>\" \u2013 a ban on federal funds to foreign family planning organisations that either offer abortions or provide information or counselling about abortion. Global health experts have cited it contributing to maternal mortality across the world. If abortion is made illegal \u2013 a very real possibility under a Romney administration \u2013 women will seek out the procedure through unsafe means. And if Obamacare is repealed, that means we're stuck with a president who thinks no American has died for lack of insurance (<a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/\" title=\"\">a Harvard study</a> says 45,000 people a year do).</p> <p>But it's more than women's current rights and lives that are on the line \u2013 the future of feminism is also at stake. Thanks to a never-ending Republican backlash against women's political and cultural gains \u2013 from workplace strides to reproductive health \u2013 American feminists have had their hands full. We're so busy trying to hold on to the rights we already have that any sort of push for forward-thinking policy and change has been out of the question.</p> <p>How can we even think about what a feminist future might look like when we have male legislators who believe women can't get pregnant if they are \"legitimately\" raped, or if they do become pregnant that it was the will of God? We're still dealing with Biology 101 over here. Our lawmakers believe birth control turns women into sluts, that invasive transvaginal ultrasounds are no big deal \u2013 \"Just close your eyes,\" Pennsylvania governor Tom Corbett said \u2013 and that women's lives matter so little that <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/169461/republicans-test-your-knowledge-women, http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/post/paul-ryans-abortion-problem/2012/08/30/1e1d34b2-f2d0-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_blog.html\" title=\"\">it's alright to tell hospitals to let us die rather than provide abortions</a>.That's not to say that Romney hasn't been working hard to woo women's votes anyway. But the Republican \"pro-woman\" rhetoric has largely comprised damage control and obfuscation. His campaign keeps repeating that women don't care about birth control, abortion rights, and reproductive health \u2013 that women are concerned about the \"real\" issues, like the economy. The fact that women's financial security is intimately connected to the ability to decide if and when to have children seems to be lost on them. They also don't seem to realise that American women don't like men telling us what we do and don't believe in \u2013 we can decide for ourselves.</p> <p>How women are actually likely to vote has been widely projected. An <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10500121\" title=\"\">Associated Press poll </a>showed that the gender gap had disappeared, but later numbers \u2013 like an ABC News/Washington Post daily poll \u2013 showed Obama at a comfortable lead among women. The first polls showing the narrowing gender gap was probably a result of Obama's lukewarm performance in the first debate, yet Michael Dimock, the associate director of the Pew Research Centre, told the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/mitt-romney-gender-gap_n_2041803.html\" title=\"\">Huffington Post</a>: \"The entirety of polling over the course of this year suggests \u2026 that the gender gap is likely to look very similar to the last few election cycles, with women [likely] somewhere between six and eight points to favour Obama.\"</p> <p>Obama has not been the perfect feminist president. When he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/12/obama-science-morning-after-pill\" title=\"\">stopped the Food and Drug Administration </a> making Plan B \u2013 also known as the morning-after pil or emergency contraceptionl \u2013 available for young women under 17 without a prescription, I was livid. I don't always agree with his decisions and policies. But when it comes to who will be better for women \u2013 when I think about my two-year-old daughter and the world I want for her \u2013 the choice is clear.</p> <p>I want women to be able to stop worrying about whether or not their hard-won rights will be stripped away. I want to know that my daughter will have the ability to control her body and reproductive future. And I want to know that feminists, who have been tirelessly holding on to our gains, will have some space to think about progressive change rather than just reactionary activism.</p> <p>We should now be able to stop desperately fighting to hold ground and&#xa0;think about what American women&#xa0;need to move forward.</p>",
  "<p>In a hushed room at <a href=\"http://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Harper Adams agricultural college</a> in deepest Shropshire, two middle-aged women in white coats and straw butcher's hats are cackling over a floppy sausage. \"That's definitely minus four, that is!\" one shrieks, as the unfortunate banger droops sadly against a chart I later discover is officially known as \"the Fisher sausage flop-o-meter\".</p> <p>To their right, a fight's brewing over a sausage flavoured with toffee apple \u2013 \"I'm sorry, that's disgusting,\" one judge says, spitting discreetly into a napkin. I notice the man from the Meat Trades Journal is wearing a T-shirt proclaiming \"Meat is murder. Tasty, tasty murder.\" It's all a bit surreal, behind the scenes at the <a href=\"http://www.lovepork.co.uk/blog/article/sausage-week-2012\" title=\"\">British Sausage Week</a> awards.</p> <p>In fairness to the judges, they've been there for two days on the trot, rating sausages on filling, texture, taste and appearance (\"What is it saying to you?\" head judge Keith Fisher asks me earnestly at one point, as we inspect a pork-and-apple number). Over 400 bangers have been prodded, torn open and scrutinised for rogue air pockets or pieces of gristle, and those involved take their responsibilities very seriously. Fisher, a fourth-generation master butcher, says he prepared this morning with a fry-up \u2013 \"a full cooked breakfast\", he clarifies, adding, lest there be any doubt, \"with sausages\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398641257\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351704005304/The-Fisher-sausage-flop-o-001.jpg\" alt=\"The Fisher sausage flop-o-meter\" width=\"220\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most sausages are eaten at dinnertime these days, and the modern hunger for novelty has us tasting some very curious combinations, including a&#xa0;Christmas-pudding banger even Fisher grudgingly admits is \"actually very nice\". People are ever more interested in unusual flavours, he acknowledges, but the traditionalist in him adds: \"Believe me, there will always be a place for the classic breakfast-type sausage.\"</p> <p>Modern sausages are generally made from familiar cuts such as shoulder and belly, which have a good distribution of fat. (Low-fat sausages, Fisher says, are hard to get right: \"If you use a lean cut, you lose quite a bit of the flavour. I'd rather just have fewer sausages.\") Higher meat-content isn't everything either: beyond about 83%, a sausage turns into \"a solid hunk of meat, and it does tend to be drier\".</p> <p>Fisher reckons the standard of the Great British banger is higher now than it's ever been: \"Years ago, things were different, but there's nothing in the last 10 years I've looked at and said, 'No, I'm not judging that.'\" The ladies at the grill agree, confirming that these days there are \"very few explosions\" \u2013 a&#xa0;hazard of the badly filled, fatty bangers of yesteryear \u2013 and no, \"we never, ever prick them\". Piercing a good sausage, and letting out its juices, is a crime akin to microwaving them \u2013 slow frying is the connoisseurs' choice.</p> <p>Indeed the first British Sausage Week, back in 1997, was a response to flagging sales of said traditional banger. The competition and the national tour that follows have, according to Claire Holland of BPEX, which represents pig farmers, improved the quality and variety on offer immeasurably. These days, we make sausages to be proud of: only this week the <a href=\"http://www.lincolnshiresausages.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lincolnshire Sausage Association</a> lost an appeal for its product to be considered for EU protected geographical indication status, because the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ruled there are already \"too many variations\" across the UK. Seems everyone's in the quality sausage market these days. As to who'll pick up the coveted <a href=\"http://porkforbutchers.bpex.org.uk/product/BSW/2012_Mr_SAUSAGE_colour_in_picture.jpg\" title=\"\">Mr Sausage</a> trophies this year \u2013 well, we'll all have to wait until next week to find out. But there's one thing I'm sure of: the winner won't be floppy.</p>",
  "<p>The images of a paralysed New York City at the mercy of Hurricane Sandy's wall of water have forced climate change on to the political agenda in the final week of the 2012 presidential election campaign. Even before Sandy made landfall political commentators were debating whether the storm would be better for Mitt Romney or Barack Obama. In any event it has brought forth statements from prominent Democrats and elected officials on climate change and spurred public debate about the neglected topic.</p> <p>Campaigners said the devastating storm could turn out to be the October Surprise of the elections, exposing Republicans' failure to engage with an issue that is no longer a distant threat, but a present day danger.</p> <p>Bill Clinton, campaigning for Barack Obama in Minnesota, attacked Romney for using climate change as a laugh line in his convention speech. \"He ridiculed the president for his efforts to fight global warming in economically beneficial ways. He said, 'Oh, you're going to turn back the seas,'\" Clinton told a rally. \"In my part of America, we would like it if someone could've done that yesterday.\"</p> <p>He went on to argue the local leaders from both parties were already ahead of Romney and Republicans in Congress in engaging with the issue. Michael Bloomberg, a Republican, and Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, have both cited Sandy as evidence of climate change.</p> <p>\"All up and down the east coast, there are mayors, many of them Republicans, who are being told, 'You've got to move these houses back away from the ocean. You've got to lift them up. Climate change is going to raise the water levels on a permanent basis. If you want your town insured, you have to do this,'\" Clinton said.</p> <p>Al Gore in a statement on his website sounded a similar theme, calling for Sandy to serve as a brutal wakeup call to the realities of climate change, much as floods in Nashville hit home for him in 2010.</p> <p>\"For many, Hurricane Sandy may prove to be a similar event: a time when the climate crisis \u2013 which is often sequestered to the far reaches of our everyday awareness became a reality,\" Gore wrote.</p> <p>\"Hurricane Sandy is a disturbing sign of things to come. We must heed this warning and act quickly to solve the climate crisis. Dirty energy makes dirty weather.\"</p> <p>The Republican contender had tried to cast Obama's promise for action on global warming as a sign of grandiosity.</p> <p>Romney and Obama have avoided mentioning climate change on the campaign trail and the topic did not get a single mention in the televised presidential debates \u2013 for the first time since 1988.The absence has frustrated campaigners who say this year's heat waves, drought, wildfires \u2013 and now Sandy \u2013 provide ample evidence of climate change and of the urgency for action.</p> <p>\"Climate change used to be a science of projection. Now it is a science of attribution,\" said Angela Anderson, climate and energy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists. She also argued the public was ahead of political leaders in engaging with the topic.</p> <p>\"People are beginning to connect extreme weather events to climate change more and more at the same moment that there is this deafening silence, so that is incredibly disappointing.\"</p> <p>Multiple studies have linked the warming of the atmosphere and the oceans to stronger Atlantic storms \u2013 though scientists balk at attributing a single severe storm such as Sandy to climate change.</p> <p>\"The terrifying truth is that America faces a future full of Frankenstorms,\" said Shaye Wolf, the climate science director for the Centre for Biological Diversity. \"Climate change raises sea levels and super-sizes storms. The threat of killer winds and crushing storm surges will grow by the year unless we get serious about tackling greenhouse gas pollution.\"</p> <p>Warmer ocean temperatures add more energy to storms. Warmer air holds more moisture, which means more rainfall. Sandy dumped more than 11 inches of rain in some parts of New Jersey, according to Nasa.</p> <p>In addition, there is growing evidence that Americans are increasingly vulnerable to such severe events.</p> <p>Sea-level rise, due to climate change, makes for more extreme storm surges. And sea-level rise in the north-eastern US is occurring three or four times faster than the global average, putting more Americans in harm's way. About 100 million Americans live in coastal areas within 3ft of mean sea level in cities such as Boston and Miami as well as New York.</p> <p>As Mike Tidwell, the founder of Chesapeake Climate Action, wrote this week: \"We are all from New Orleans now. Climate change \u2013 through the measurable rise of sea levels and a documented increase in the intensity of Atlantic storms \u2013 has made 100 million Americans virtually as vulnerable to catastrophe as the victims of Hurricane Katrina were seven years ago.\"</p>",
  "<p>Australian-owned Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks slumped to a loss in the last 12 months, weighed down by losses on commercial property loans which have turned sour.</p> <p>In the midst of a programme to cut 1,500 jobs by 2015, the banks reported a \u00a3183m loss in the year to the end of September and put pressure on its Australian parent company National Australia Bank (NAB), which suffered its first drop in profits since 2009.</p> <p>Some 468 UK jobs have already been axed in the cost cutting programme and the group chief executive, Cameron Clyne, acknowledged \"ongoing challenges\" in the UK market were dragging down the overall group.</p> <p>\"The group has taken action on several key issues during the year.

The past year's performance, however, demonstrates the need for the difficult steps we are taking.\".</p> <p>Like other banks in the UK, Clydesdale and Yorkshire have been taking provisions to cover the cost of misselling payment protection insurance,</p> <p>The troublesome commercial property portfolio was transferred to the main bank in October in an attempt to take pressure off the UK business. This allowed the bank's crucial core tier one capital ratio - the purest measure of its financial strength - to rise from 9.6% to 11.6%.</p> <p>Clydesdale has joined the government's funding for lending scheme - intended to help bolster lending to households and small businesses - and is supporting \u00a333bn of lending through the scheme. Last year, the bank's business lending was down 2.8%, but it said that this had not fallen as fast as the wider market which was down 5.1%.</p> <p>Despite the pressure from the UK, NAB's profits were down just 0.5% to A$5.4bn (\u00a33.5bn) and if the UK business is stripped the bank said its Australian business reported a rise of more than 9% in profits during the year.</p>",

Spain (25.8%) and Greece (25.1% in July) had the highest unemployment in the eurozone, while France looks much like Italy (both at 10.8%), with a steady rise in joblessness. August data for Greece will be published next week, although the true picture is probably worse than the official figures show as a growing number of Greek workers remain nominally employed but have not been paid for some time.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the jobless data was \"dismal\", adding: \"Eurozone labour markets remain under serious pressure from ongoing weakened economic activity and low business confidence.\"</p> <p>Youth unemployment also hit a new high in Spain with 54.2% of under-25-year-olds out of work, up from 53.8%.</p> <p>Across the whole 27 nation European Union, 25.751 million men and women were without jobs last month \u2013 an increase of 169,000 from August \u2013 while the unemployment rate stayed at 10.6%.</p> <p>By comparison, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/17/uk-unemployment-falls-lowest-ons\" title=\"\">unemployment rate was 7.9% in the UK</a>, 7.8% in the US and 4.2% in Japan in September.</p> <p>There was some good news for the eurozone though \u2013 inflation eased to 2.5% in October, from 2.6%. Energy prices continued to rise, by 7.8%, but by less than the month before, when they climbed by 9.1% year-on-year. Food became dearer, however, with prices up 3.2% compared with 2.9% in September.</p> <p>Andrea Broughton, an economist at the Institute for Employment Studies said: \"Given the ongoing financial difficulties of the European Union and the likelihood of continuing job losses in the public sector as austerity measures begin to bite, overall unemployment levels and youth unemployment in particular are likely to carry on rising for the foreseeable future.\"</p> <p>She said a north-south split, which has dramatically opened up since the banking crash, would get worse.</p> <p>\"The trend is not upwards in all countries \u2013 unemployment levels actually decreased in seven member states on a year-on-year basis, including in Lithuania and Latvia, where it may be that the worst effects of the crisis are over. In Germany, although the economy is slowing there are as yet no adverse effects on unemployment, which has fallen on a year-on-year basis.\"</p> <p>In some countries the unemployment figures are depressed by a rise in emigration. Ireland, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have seen a strong rise in the number of people, mainly young, seeking work abroad.</p> <p>Roughly 370,000 people emigrated from Spain in 2011, 10 times more than before the banking crisis hit the country in 2008.</p> <p>Although about 86% of them were naturalised immigrants born abroad, there is also a growing number of native Spaniards saying \"ya basta\" (\"enough is enough\").

People have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/daryl-hannah-transcanada-keystonexl-pipeline\">putting their bodies on the line</a> and risking arrest in order to protect our future, to acknowledge climate change disasters and to protect access to basic necessities such as uncontaminated water, soil and food. We are seeing an exponentially growing number of nationwide rallies, protests and acts of civil disobedience just to protect these fundamental life support systems.</p> <p>The threats are exacerbated by the looming death throes of an outdated and finite fossil fuel industry struggling to stay relevant in the 21st century, despite its current economic might. It's hard to reconcile the fact that the fossil fuel industry is struggling when their unprecedented profits make them the wealthiest of corporations in the history of mankind, even in this devastated global economy \u2013 but the times, they are-a-changing.</p> <p>As we have evidently exhausted the easier-to-access \"conventional\" fuels, Big Oil is now resorting to \"unconventional\" sources, and the industry must rely on more and more extreme extraction measures to obtain fossil fuel resources. These extreme forms of extraction come with a dangerous cost, and often a high economic cost as well. In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/business/energy-environment/in-a-natural-gas-glut-big-winners-and-losers.html\">New York Times article </a>on the grim economics of the natural gas boom, even the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Rex Tillerson, stated, \"We're making no money. It's all in the red.\" Texas billionaire oilman T Boone Pickens said, \"shut her down\", \"quit drilling\" and \"we are stupid to drill these wells.\"</p> <p>But they won't because the leases the companies have bought came, in most cases, with \"use it or lose it\" clauses that required them to start drilling, pay royalties or lose the leases.</p> <p>Lost leases may be an economic concern to these mega-wealthy multinational corporations, but the loss of, and lethal threat to, our living systems that we depend upon for survival is of greater concern for the rest of us. These extreme extraction processes are the fossil fuel industry's last-ditch efforts to stretch their global financial dominance as far into the 21st century as they possibly can. To access oil beyond the shallow wells of the last century \u2013 which are now mostly exhausted \u2013 one process the industry has turned to is deep-water drilling, including opening up the extremely sensitive areas in the Arctic region. We have already had a taste of the devastating repercussions of this practice from <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/25/1091581/federal-regulators-issue-more-deepwater-drilling-permits-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-since-2007/\">BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster</a> in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Another extreme resource extraction method is a strip-mining process known as tar sands oil extraction, which destroys entire ecosystems where they lie. Tar sands oil <a href=\"http://dirtyoilsands.org/tarsands\">entails</a> a wildly energy-intensive extraction process, uses millions of cubic metres of water and the resulting material must be mixed with a poisonous cocktail of chemicals.</p> <p>Tar sands exploitation leaves behind a dead zone. It also leaves behind the <a href=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2011/08/17/ten-years-after-911-%E2%80%93-canadas-true-cost-of-oil/\">largest toxic unlined impoundments</a> on the planet in enormous lakes that require firing off special cannons to keep flocks of waterfowl from landing on it (risking near-certain death).</p> <p>Threatened by the planned massive expansion of Canada's tar sands operation, which would be aided by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/daryl-hannah-transcanada-keystonexl-pipeline\">approval of either the Keystone XL or the Enbridge Energy pipelines</a>, is the awe-inspiring magnificence of the Canadian boreal forest, which serves as our first defense against global warming as it sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem; and the Athabasca delta, the world's largest freshwater delta. In the United States, Utah has a proposed a 50-square-mile tar sands exploitation project of its own, which, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-26/first-u-s-oil-sands-mine-proceeds-without-pollution-permit.html\">according to Bloomberg</a>, has just been approved \"without first obtaining a pollution permit or monitoring ground water quality\".</p> <p>To mine coal more inexpensively, the industry has taken to simply blowing up entire mountains in a mind-boggling practice called mountain top removal. Over <a href=\"http://www.backpacker.com/environmental_protection_agency_mountaintop_removal_mining_appalachian_mountains/blogs/1296\">500 mountains</a> of the United States' oldest mountain range, the Appalachians, have been unceremoniously eviscerated by the practice; the number awaiting the go-ahead is almost impossible to discover. According to Matt Wasson of Appalachian Voices:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This information seems intentionally obscured, there's no one agency that can tell you how many pending permits or mine sites are slated for destruction.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This shocking extraction method bankrupts entire communities, puts miners out of work, leaves the residents with poisoned or buried water sources, homes of no value and hosts of illnesses.</p> <p>Then, there is the breakneck boom mentality of the natural gas industry, which has moved to hydraulic fracturing, or \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/natural-gas-fracking-fires-protest\">fracking\", wells</a> \u2013 literally fracturing the earth and pumping it full of carcinogenic chemical poisons to release the gas. The process also releases quite a bit of methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. In Colorado alone, where I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/colorado-fracking-free-forever-mariel-hemingway\">attended an anti-fracking/pro-clean energy rally on 23 October</a>, there are already 49,000 active natural gas wells, with thousands of new ones being permitted every year. (In 2011 alone, another 4,659 permits were approved in Colorado.) <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_18881512\">According to the Denver Post</a>, oil and gas development reports say spills in Colorado reach surface or groundwater every five days.</p> <p>The people and communities that live adjacent to these projects are experiencing the negative repercussions of this corporate profit over public safety energy rush. An extensive number of ranch, farm and home wells have gone bad \u2013 in some homes, they can even <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/scientific-study-links-flammable-drinking-water-to-fracking\">set fire to the \"water\" coming out of their faucets</a>, and illnesses in both humans and animals are manifesting in every region. The simple fact with this rush is that the science has not caught up to the practice; and the safeguards have not had a chance to catch up with the science.</p> <p>So, what is the rush?</p> <p>These energy sources have been sequestered deep in the earth for millions of years, and they hold a higher value to society than just digging them up and combusting them in our homes and cars. We know how to collect and store energy in much less detrimental ways. Why are we not being protected? Both Canada and the US have a self-image that is creative and forward-thinking, yet we are being left in the dust by the rest of the world when it comes to energy's evolution. China and the EU have both <a href=\"http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/united-states-renewable-energy-sector-is-falling-behind-the-rest-54977.aspx\">surpassed us in renewable energy implementation</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/middle-east-pursues-150-renewable-projects-saves-oil-for-export.html\">according to the Abu Dhabi-based Clean Energy Business Council</a>, even the largest oil-producing nations in the Middle East and North Africa have stated their intentions to move to renewable energy and saving more of their oil for export.</p> <p>We know that regionally-created clean renewable energy is the path to true energy independence and energy security. We know America holds enough wind and solar potential to power our economy 100 times over. So how do we encourage the transition to an aggressive, decentralized clean regenerative energy policy? <a href=\"http://climatecommission.gov.au/about/tim-flannery/\">Tim Flannery</a>, paleontologist and chief commissioner of the Australian Climate Commission, says that incentivizing this transformation is simple: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"What we're dealing with is essentially a pollution problem, and we've known how to fix pollution problems for the last 1,000 years, since King Edward the First: you tax the polluters, get the polluter to pay.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Then why are we not doing it?</p> <p>There are a few reasons. In the US, part of the blame goes to the profoundly unethical US supreme court decision on Citizens United, which granted corporations the same rights as an individual in allowing them to donate an unlimited amount of money to finance campaigns and influence the outcome of our so-called free elections. The result of this ruling was to give an undue amount of influence to corporate polluters and, in particular, the fossil fuel industry, which is the wealthiest industry on the planet. In this year's election cycle alone, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/2012/08/election-price-tag-billion-130856.html\">$6bn will have been given</a> to campaigns, politicians and political action committees. So, the chances of a strong clean energy policy coming from Washington are extremely slim.</p> <p>Then, there's the fact that we the people are all too trusting, simply buying what we are being sold. We've been inundated with incessant, well-funded advertising campaigns of misinformation and rebranding exercises. They are currently selling the public on the idea of tar sands with the more sanitized-sounding \"oil sands\", because they think it sounds less dirty (they've also taken to calling it \"<a href=\"http://www.ethicaloil.org/\">ethical oil</a>\"). Mountain top removal is sold as \"<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-dirty-side-of-clean-coal\">clean coal</a>\", and natural gas is packaged as clean, natural and renewable. And we bought it. </p> <p>But now, there are floods and drought. People are being hit by the impacts and their kids are getting sick. Now, our water is threatened, running short \u2013 or poisoned. Our survival is on the line. So we are getting informed. The sleeping giant is waking, still a bit groggy, but moving.</p> <p>The Exxon-Mobils, Chevrons and Royal Dutch Shells of the world might have the big bucks, but when we get together, we the people have the big numbers! We will hold our politicians accountable. If necessary, as a last resort, more and more people will put their bodies on the line:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"While opposition from environmentalists and some native groups was always expected, the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project has unexpectedly united British Columbians who normally are on opposite sides.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is what I've experienced in Texas while resisting the Keystone pipeline, in West Virginia fighting mountain top removal and now, in Colorado, standing up against fracking. It's time to take on the fossil fuel industry directly, and people of all ethnicities, political ideologies and economic strata have realized: it's up to us to take a stand. Young and old are coming together and taking action in ways that have pushed them beyond their normal comfort zones to stand up for each other and for common sense. They are seeing the connection between these precarious environmental risks and the humanitarian dangers they bring.</p> <p>Those who want to be safe from the tyranny of poison will always possess the moral authority and will stand on the right side of history. I am proud to be among them.</p>",
  "<p>GlaxoSmithKline boss Sir Andrew Witty said on Wednesday that pharmaceutical companies could scale back on innovation and decamp to Asia or the US if European governments continued to impose drug pricing cuts as part of austerity programmes.</p> <p>Speaking as he announced a review of the drugmaker's European business he appealed to governments to rethink the sharp cuts that have seen prices fall by an average of 7-8% across the continent. The fall was twice as big as GSK had assumed at the beginning of the year.</p> <p>It led to a 9% slide in the group's European sales in the third quarter, and an 8% fall in overall sales to \u00a36.5bn. The company, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical group, had hoped to return to \"sustainable growth\" this year but now anticipates no sales growth.</p> <p>Sir Andrew said: \"It is not reasonable for governments to believe that they can continue to make these sorts of price reductions and delay the introduction of novel medicines without that creating unintended consequences.\"</p> <p>He would not be drawn on whether the European review would entail job cuts. Asked about the UK, where the company has its headquarters and employs 15,000 people in research labs and factories, Sir Andrew reiterated that GSK would be hiring more people in the long run.</p> <p>He said government-imposed price cuts in crisis-hit countries like Greece had cascaded through Europe, with Germany also enforcing big price reductions in respiratory medicines and vaccines. \"The effect of a Greek price cut in February, for example, could still be rippling through the market a year later.\"</p> <p>He recounted that in one European country, which he would not name, drug prices were now 50% below where they were in 1996. \"Could this be the new normal? It could. I hope very much it isn't. It will erode the attractiveness of Europe for innovation, and for the entire industry.\"</p> <p>Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research, said: \"Austerity measures in Europe are having a significant impact on GSK's growth but fortunately the company has a strong late-stage pipeline.\" GSK plans to file for regulatory approval by the end of the year for new treatments for HIV, type II diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \u2013 an umbrella term for chronic bronchitis or emphysema.</p> <p>The group's consumer healthcare division - which sells products such as Sensodyne, Horlicks, Panadol and Lucozade - is also doing well. For example, it sold 3.5bn cups of Horlicks in India last year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.efpia.eu/news/letter-efpia-president-sir-andrew-witty-european-heads-states-and-governments\" title=\"\">Sir Andrew recently wrote a letter on behalf of the industry</a> in his capacity as president of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, in which he warned: \"Europe is already a world leader in the pharmaceutical sector ... However, other locations such as the US and certain Asian countries present increasingly strong competition. Cost-containment policies that create market distortions - will drive investment elsewhere and consign Europe to a gradual decline, to the second rank of the new global order.\"</p> <p>Medicine pricing systems vary across Europe. In the UK, drugmakers set their own prices but there is a profit cap. Every five years, guidance for pricing is established through the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, a voluntary agreement between the government and the industry. They are currently thrashing out a new regime for 2014, which is expected to include value-based pricing for all new medicines for the first time. Medicines would be assessed on the basis of how well they meet unmet clincial needs, and how innovative they are. Germany also has value-based pricing. The NHS spends about \u00a39bn a year on branded prescription drugs.</p> <p>As governments slash healthcare costs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/greek-austerity-speculation-pharmaceuticals?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">speculators are buying medicines cheaply in one country</a> - such as Greece or the UK - to sell in another at a much higher price, according to business intelligence firm GlobalData.</p> <p>Keith Bowman of Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"GSK's results have again failed to inspire. Europe continues to weigh, whilst hoped for new product sales are yet to compensate for disposals and tough comparatives.\"</p>",
  "<p>Calvin Klein fashion and its famous underwear is to be reunited under one roof after US fashion group Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) said it had agreed to buy rival Warnaco for $2.9bn (\u00a31.8bn).</p> <p>The deal comes 15 years after the CK underwear and jeans businesses were licensed to Warnaco and will bring the entire brand under the control of Tom Murry, who has been in charge of Calvin Klein at PVH.</p> <p>Coming two years after PVH bought fashion brand Tommy Hilfiger for $3bn, the deal, at a 34% premium to Warnaco's last closing share price, will also give the US firm control of Warnaco-owned brands, including Speedo swimwear.</p> <p>Warnaco shares rose 40% on the New York stock exchange after the news. PVH shares gained 23%.</p> <p>PVH chief executive Emanuel Chirico said: \"Having direct global control of the two largest apparel categories for Calvin Klein \u2013 jeans and underwear \u2013 will allow us to unlock additional growth potential of this powerful designer brand.\"</p> <p>PVH, also owner of Van Heusen shirts, expects the sale to be finalised next year and give it annual revenues of more than $8bn. PVH and Warnaco were considered as potential bidders for jeans maker True Religion, which is up for sale.</p> <p>A modern competitor to the likes of Ralph Lauren and Michael Kors, PVH's roots go back to 1881, when it was a shirt mender for miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>PVH bought the Calvin Klein brand in 2003. Established by the designer of the same name in the late 1960s, it went on to transform the men's underwear market in the 80s and propelled its advertising models to fame. Actor Mark Wahlberg famously wore the boxer shorts on billboards in the 90s and Brooke Shields wore the jeans in 1979. Recent models include Diane Kruger, Eva Mendes and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd.</p>",
  "<p>Manufacturing and construction survey data published over the next couple of days should give a clearer picture of the economy's trajectory than the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/30/uk-retailers-sales-growth-cbi\" title=\"\">confusing response of consumers reported earlier this week</a>.</p> <p>According to the consumer surveys, we are spending more in the shops and borrowing more on unsecured credit than at any time since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>But the surveys also said consumer confidence in the outlook for the economy had fallen. Worse, some economists argue the extra borrowing was all about desperate consumers adding to their debts just to buy food and clothes \u2013 not to splash out in joy at the country leaving recession. (OK: the consumer/retail surveys were carried out before ONS figures showed the recession was over, but you get the point). And, as my colleague Larry Elliott has pointed out, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2012/oct/29/uk-economy-bank-england-consumer-borrowing\" title=\"\">the upturn in borrowing is still from historically low levels</a>.</p> <p>So the consumer is confused, but weak figures from the manufacturing sector during October would be more definitive. A repeat of the recent contraction in construction could also show that Britain is on course to suffer an unprecedented third recession in four years.</p> <p>That's the view of several leading economists, who warn that a triple-dip is a strong possibility after the UK recovered in the third quarter of the year \u2013 but only due to the Olympics and special factors that disguised the weak state of the economy.</p> <p>Britain looks and behaves much like an ocean liner holed below the waterline and listing while the crew patch the damage and work the pumps.</p> <p>The purchasing managers' indices from Markit are expected to show the recovery in manufacturing that appeared to lay a strong foundation for growth in 2011 has become a distant memory, while construction has yet to recover from the 2008 banking crash.</p> <p>James Mitchell, an economist at Warwick Business School, is one of the doom-mongers. He argues that a triple-dip recession is on the cards after a faltering recovery from the longest economic depression since the 1920s. In his view, the Olympics and a second bank holiday in the previous three months combined with the bad weather of the early summer to flatter figures that showed the economy bouncing back by 1% in the three months to the end of September.</p> <p>Last week he said the business school's research indicates that there is around a one in three chance that economic growth for 2012, as a whole, will be positive. But if falling GDP between October and December were followed by another three months of contraction, it would give the UK the dubious honour of being the first western nation to suffer three recessions since the financial crash.</p> <p>Mitchell argues that the scarring from such a long period of underinvestment will lead to a long period of low growth.</p> <p>\"The recession does raise questions about what economic growth will look like in the future. Historically, GDP has grown about 2.5% each year on average. There is a danger that the current recession has left a permanent scar on the economy, which is being picked up in the lower productivity data. If so, when the UK economy does emerge from recession, people may well have to get used to less rapid increases in their standards of living than their parents experienced.\"</p> <p>If the construction figures are poor on Friday, Ben Broadbent, the former Goldman Sachs economist who sits on the Bank of England's interest-rate setting committee, will be unsurprised. While he is moderately optimistic about the prospects for an industry that is enjoying cheaper credit and undergoing a private sector revival, albeit from a very low base, he says it has suffered for a long time.</p> <p>\"The prospects for the construction sector look less unfavourable than they have for a while. But in what is a volatile sector, and an uncertain environment, this is not the same thing as a hard forecast,\" he said in a recent speech.</p> <p>Manufacturing is suffering an investment squeeze. Some economists explain the rise in employment as a simple trade-off between capital and labour. Faced with production from capital or labour, a business weighs the costs of each. When borrowing to invest in new plant and machinery is expensive, but hiring and firing employees is cheap, they choose hiring temp or part-time staff.</p> <p>It is a scenario that tells us the sector is far from healthy. Years of underinvestment could be wrecking its prospects when a recovery finally comes.</p> <p>Triple dip, here we come.</p>",

  "<p>\"Roland Emmerich was right,\" said one screenwriter who had rung me up me excitedly to see whether my area in Brooklyn was underwater or not. She had in mind Emmerich's 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, which consumed New York with a giant tidal wave, although we soon fell to swapping other cine-antecedents: 1998's Deep Impact, 1933's Deluge, and Spielberg's AI with its visions of a sunken Coney Island, underwater skyscrapers, and a statue of liberty submerged but for its torch, now become the perch for seagulls. </p> <p>Such is the fate of New York, that when disaster strikes our first thought goes to the movies, so repeatedly has the city been devastated over the years, whether by tidal wave (Deep Impact), zombie plague (I Am Legend) asteroid (Armageddon), alien (Independence day), or ape (Planet of the Apes). </p> <p>It is the apocalyptic city par excellence. \"What a ruin it will make!\" HG Wells exclaimed, upon catching sight of the New York skyline, which formed one of many indelible images from Monday night \u2013 not entirely blacked out, but partially, from 39th Street and below, which meant that unlike the blackouts of 2003 and 1977, we got to see it at night, the buildings of Greenwich Village just visible in silhouette against the lights further uptown.</p> <p>The citizen in me was horrified, but I'd be lying if I said that the connoisseur of apocalypse \u2013 and since 9/11 all New Yorkers have been experts in that field \u2013 wasn't awed and fascinated at this fresh evidence of what happens to the city in extremis: what <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/time-for-ruin-porn.html \">Andrew Sullivan has termed</a> \"ruin porn.\" </p> <p>Everyone compared 9/11 to a disaster flick but Hollywood would have made the fireballs the jets made when they hit the side of the World Trade Center much bigger; and scattered the debris much wider. It was, curiously, the modesty of the image that terrified: seeing that a jet makes this sized fireball when it hits a building, and casts no debris at all, instead vaporizing on contact.</p> <p>Something similar applied on Monday. What we saw was both less than and more than the hyperbolized destruction of the movies \u2013 not Emmerich's tidal waves, or Spielberg's underwater skyscrapers, but the half-submerged streets of Hoboken; cars floating down the street like flotsam against a grate; the beaches of New Jersey, relocated to the street; shuttered subways, and a rising tide of briny water. Roland Emmerich was only half right. <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/blockbusters-never-prepared-nyc-for-sandy.html\">As Vulture noted</a>:\u2014</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No matter how often the eggheads told us to watch for the storm surge, not falling skies, we still expected Death From Above \u2013 because that's the apocalypse we're best rehearsed for, from Independence Day to The Avengers. The actual onslaught turned out to be far more insidious, less visible, with few celluloid precedents: a bubbling-up from below, a slow submerging of our vulnerable undercarriage and the corrosion of our centuries-old subterranean infrastructure. Sandy wasn't the cataclysm we'd been trailered; it was more slow-acting snakebite than one-punch obliteration. It could color our future shared nightmares of Big Apple Armageddon, a sector of splashy pessimism that has, for the last decade, been dominated by The Obvious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Because Sandy made landfall in the evening, most of us woke up to find out what had happened, the storm having moved on, leaving behind images whose stillness more closely resembled the eerie landscapes of fiction, rather than the movies. </p> <p>I was reminded in particular of JG Ballard's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Drowned-World-J-Ballard/dp/1857988833\">The Drowned World</a>, in which the polar icecaps have melted turning Europe is \"a system of giant lagoons\" and the American mid-west into \"an enormous gulf opening into the Hudson Bay\".</p> <p>More recently, we have had Kim Robinson's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Forty-Signs-Rain-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0553585800\">Forty Signs of Rain</a> in which rising sea levels have turned America's cities into versions of Venice:\u2014</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A city floored with water. Here it was quite shallow, of course. But the front steps of all the buildings came down into an expanse of brown water, and the water was all at one level, as with any other lake or sea. Brown-blue, blue-brown, brown-gray, brown, gray, dirty white \u2013 drab urban tints all. The rain pocked it into an infinity of rings and bounding droplets, and gusts of wind tore cats' paws. </p> </blockquote> <p>The comparison with old Europe is telling. For New York has taken up the position in the popular imagination that used to be occupied by London, which, in the years leading up to 1916, was subjected to repeated fictional apocalypse, in pulp novels gripped by pre-war jitters. </p> <p>\"Great wars that devastated civilizations were fought in the skies and on imaginary battlefields dwarfing those of Verdun and Stalingrad,\" writes literary historian <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/W.-Warren-Wagar/e/B001HD3402\">W Warren Wagar</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fascist dictatorships led to a new Dark Age, class and race struggles plunged civilization into Neolithic savagery, terrorists armed with super-weapons menaced Global peace. Floods, volcanic eruptions, plagues, epochs of ice, colliding comets, exploding or cooling suns, and alien invaders laid waste to the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sounds like a movie pitch.</p>",

In order to get the wide range of signatories, the pledge that Defra has settled for is not as good as it should have been, and not as good as the one retailers have already made.</p> <p>\"[The RSPO] is the only worthwhile standard and the one retailers have committed to.\"</p> <p>BRC director of food and sustainability, Andrew Opie, said: \"If the government is serious about achieving comprehensive change in the way palm oil is produced and saving rainforest habitats, it should be pushing other sectors to follow retailers' lead.</p> <p>\"Retailers have already pledged to meet the world's most rigorous standards on 100% certified sustainable palm oil, and said they will do it by the end of 2015, because that's the way to generate a market for sustainable product and eliminate the rest.\"</p> <p>The environment minister, Richard Benyon, said the government would lead the way by ensuring that only environmentally friendly-sourced palm oil would be used in central government food and catering services.</p> <p>\"People want to know that the products they are using are not contributing to deforestation and climate change and many UK businesses are already starting to make changes. Producers, manufacturers and charities will continue working together to speed up the move to 100% sustainable palm oil in everyday products,\" he said.</p> <p>Palm oil is one of the world's most rapidly expanding food crops and used extensively in the food industry as frying fats, and as an ingredient in biscuits, margarine, snacks and bakery products. It is also used in the production of biodiesel, in animal feed, soaps and other cleaning products and cosmetics. Its production has been linked to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/29/fires-indonesia-orangutan\" title=\"\">destruction of rainforest habitats</a> in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, and it is <a href=\"http://www.forestcarbonasia.org/in-the-media/oil-palm-surging-source-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions/\" title=\"\">a rising source of greenhouse gas emissions</a>, which come from clearing forests for crop cultivation.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/ASEAN-EU_-_trade_and_investment_statistics\" title=\"\">Eurostat data</a>, the UK imported 397,000 metric tonnes of palm oil and 53,000 metric tonnes of palm kernel oil in 2011. Defra has estimated that only 24% was sourced from sustainably certified plantations.</p> <p>Defra's statement coincides with the annual conference on the ingredient, held by the RSPO in Singapore. <a href=\"http://www.rspo.org/en/acop_2011-2012_reports\" title=\"\">Data released by the RSPO this week</a> showed that UK supermarkets including the Co-operative, Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury's, and manufacturers like United Biscuits, Warburtons and Burton's food are already at \u2013 or very close to \u2013 using 100% RSPO-certified palm oil.</p> <p>Waitrose said on Tuesday that it would reach its target of 100% fully sustainable palm oil by the end of this year. The supermarket lists palm oil in its ingredients and claims to be the first retailer to use the RSPO logo on its soap. Riyaz Dhalla, Waitrose senior technologist, said: \"This is an important issue for our customers and we're delighted to be able to help them make an ethical purchasing decision.\"</p> <p>The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said many food and drink manufacturers had made substantial progress. The FDF director of sustainability, Andrew Kuyk, said: \"Many food and drink manufacturers have in place long-standing commitments to using 100% certified sustainable palm oil and the national statement is an important step towards a wider reassurance for consumers that the products they enjoy contain oil from environmentally friendly sources.\"</p> <p>Adam Harrison of WWF International \u2013 another RSPO member \u2013 said that Defra's move was significant, but given the urgency of the situation relating to the impacts on natural habitats relating to palm oil production, the statement needed to go further.</p> <p>\"The impacts of irresponsible and unsustainable palm oil expansion to meet growing demand are completely unacceptable in terms of deforestation, damage to wildlife and climate change. The urgency of the problem needs an equally urgent response. Whilst we welcome the national statement we are concerned that it does not convey clearly enough the need to take action now.</p> <p>Palm oil is a \"hidden oil\" for consumers. Currently in the EU, palm oil can be labelled as vegetable oil, meaning that consumers cannot easily make an educated purchasing choice.</p> <p>Last year it was announced that changes to food labelling would make it easier for consumers to identify products containing palm oil. Changes to the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/labellingnutrition/foodlabelling/proposed_legislation_en.htm\" title=\"\">European Food Information Regulations</a> will mean labels have to identify the specific types of vegetable oils that have been used. Businesses are already starting to implement the change, which will be mandatory on all food products from 13 December 2014.</p>",
  "<p>More than one in three men surveyed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's war-torn east admits committing sexual assault, and three in four believe that a woman who \"does not dress decently is asking to be raped\", <a href=\"http://www.genderjustice.org.za/resources/doc_download/101471-preliminary-results-from-the-images-study-in-eastern-drc.html\" title=\"\">researchers have found</a>.</p> <p>Some 61.4% of men interviewed said women sometimes deserve to be beaten; 42.7% think that \"if a woman doesn't show physical resistance when forced to have sex, it's not rape\"; and 27.9% believe that sometimes women want to be raped.</p> <p>Well over 40% of the men polled asserted that a man should reject his wife when she has been raped.</p> <p>The findings show that sexual violence is much more than a weapon of war, activists said, and reflect widespread acceptance of patriarchal norms and rape myths. They also pointed to Congo's incendiary mix of conflict, poverty and weak law enforcement as causal factors in need of urgent redress.</p> <p>The study was carried out by the South African-based <a href=\"http://www.genderjustice.org.za\" title=\"\">Sonke Gender Justice Network</a> and the Brazilian non-government organisation <a href=\"http://www.promundo.org.br/en\" title=\"\">Promundo</a> in and near Goma in Congo's North Kivu province. A total of 708 men and 754 women aged between 18 and 59 took part in individual interviews and focus group discussions in June this year.</p> <p>The self-reporting of men is particularly unusual and striking. Some 34% admit having carried out some form of sexual violence in conflict, homes or other settings.</p> <p>Almost two-thirds agree with the statement that \"women should accept partner violence to keep the family together\", and almost a third endorse the view that \"a woman who is raped has provoked this by her attitude\". More than a quarter believe that \"a man can force a woman to have sex and she may enjoy it\".</p> <p>The preliminary report notes: \"In qualitative interviews, men openly shared their opinions about the 'right to have sex' with their female partner even if she refuses; most men did not consider it to be rape to force their wives to have sex with them. Other men took any 'provocation' by a woman to mean that she wanted sex.\"</p> <p>As an example, it quotes a 48-year-old man who said a girl entered his shop and asked for water: \"When a girl is asking for water in such a way, she wants sex. So I took her in the middle of my shop. I think she liked it because her body accepted me to enter.\"</p> <p>The study, part of the International Men and Gender Equality Survey, also suggests that many men are themselves victims of violence, including sexual violence, and shows a clear association between exposure to violence and increased likelihood of subsequent perpetration.</p> <p>It makes recommendations including far greater promotion of gender equality in schools and public policy and a massive campaign of psycho-social care for boys and girls exposed to multiple forms of violence at young ages.</p> <p>It is estimated that at least half a million women have been raped in eastern Congo since 1998, prompting the UN to brand it \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8650112.stm\" title=\"\">the rape capital of the world</a>\".</p> <p>Henny Slegh, Promundo's regional coordinator in the Great Lakes region and principal investigator for the new study, said: \"The whole world knows there is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/48-women-raped-hour-congo\" title=\"\">lot of sexual violence here</a>. We want to know why. The main thing we found is there are conditions of extreme poverty and conflict and an inadequate response by the national and especially international community contributing to the cycle of violence.</p> <p>\"Gender inequalities exist everywhere but many parts of the world live under better conditions. In this environment it is clearly worse. There are not educational opportunities to change these attitudes. That's what responses and interventions must focus on.\"</p> <p>But there are grounds for optimism, Slegh added, in the honesty and engagement of respondents. \"Men and women said: 'This is the first time I got asked questions where I can tell my story.' One man said he'd raped a girl a week before because he felt it was normal. He was exchanging opinions and it helped him see it another way. The men were very open and said they would like groups discussions more often.\"</p> <p>This was also welcomed by Micheline Muzaneza, a former Congolese child refugee who now works with victims at the Sonke network in Cape Town, South Africa. \"Men accepting and saying, 'Yes, I did this,' is a big step,\" she said. \"We need to work on that.\"</p> <p>Gender inequality is handed down through the generations, she continued. \"They think a woman must be in the kitchen, that a woman is like a child. The cultural attitude is that a man can beat a woman. They grew up like that, seeing their father beat their mother. To punish a rival armed movement, they say: 'Let's go and rape their women and show we are stronger than them.' The woman becomes an object.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.healafrica.org\" title=\"\">Heal Africa</a> runs a hospital for rape victims in Goma and recently<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/congo-rape-number-rise-rebels\" title=\"\"> reported a sharp increase in cases because of rising militia fighting</a>. Emmanuel Baabo, leader of its projects dealing with sexual violence, said: \"The attitude of the men who have been asked in this study is not acceptable. How can one think that a woman wants to be raped?</p> <p>\"But I am not surprised at the outcome of this survey. It shows the ignorance of many Congolese men and that in the Congolese culture women are still today often seen as inferior to men. This attitude is also a question of education. The more men are educated, the more they respect generally women.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The armed groups consider violence as a weapon of war. And [seeing] that the system of justice is not working correctly, the impunity makes the situation even worse.\"</p> <p>War in eastern Congo has killed and displaced millions over nearly two decades. At least half of those surveyed live below the absolute poverty line and hunger is a daily reality, with 40% of men and 43% of women having only one meal a day.</p> <p>Sonke is calling for for more engagement with men and women and a transformation of gender relations and social justice. Dean Peacock, its co-founder and executive director, said: \"On the question of whether men can change, the answer is certainly yes, including in Congo.</p> <p>\"There's also evidence that a range of interventions can speed that up: group education, mass media efforts, policy change, including the development and implementation of laws that sanction and deter violence, and disrupt the toxic combination of men's sense of entitlement to women's bodies and their sense of impunity for using violence against women.</p> <p>\"All of those interventions are needed desperately in Congo. There are fledgling efforts to engage men: the Congolese Men's Network, for instance, is working in Kivu to challenge men to speak out against men's violence. These must be supported and strengthened.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's the afternoon shift change at the Harrison Resources mine, and about 30 miners are heading home after 10 hours shovelling for coal on an exposed hilltop in eastern Ohio. The men are dressed in an unofficial uniform of jeans, T-shirt and hard hat, and they speak in unison, too, when asked about the presidential election, now less than a week away.</p> <p>\"Obama's done more damage in the last three years than anyone in the last 50,\" said Brad Knight. \"He and his advisers are a bunch of tree-huggers, east coast and west coast\".</p> <p>\"The way Obama's handling the coal business,\" said Lanny Stephen, \"it looks like he's trying to fade it out.\" A third miner, Trent Sigman, chimed in: \"They ought to raise the standards in China before they come after us \u2013 their standards are much less strict than ours\".</p> <p>Anger is running high in the coal country of Ohio. With the final countdown to election day under way, front yards in Cadiz, the nearest small town to the mine, are stacked with placards promoting the Romney-Ryan ticket alongside signs saying: \"Stop the war on coal \u2013 fire Obama\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398636114\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351699877256/Stop-the-war-on-coal-sign-004.jpg\" alt=\"'Stop the war on coal' sign, Ohio\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Stop the war on coal' sign, Ohio. Photograph: Ed Pilkington for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Pilkington/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republicans and their Super Pac supporters have been aggressively stoking emotions within Cadiz and neighbouring mining communities, bombarding the area with TV and radio adverts on the theme of the \"war on coal\". The intention is clear: in an election as razor-close as it looks to be in Ohio, a swing towards Mitt Romney in coal country could be enough to tip the entire state \u2013 and with it the US presidency \u2013 in his favour.</p> <p>That's why Paul Ryan, Romney's running mate, was in the coal town of Zanesville on Saturday telling a rally that \"here in this part of Ohio, we have so much energy, let's use our coal.\"</p> <p>That's also why outside lobbying groups with links to energy interests have been hammering the area with adverts accusing Obama of destroying jobs. <a href=\"http://americansforprosperity.org/failingagenda/files/2012/10/AFP-OhioCoalRadio-mix1.mp3\">One such ad</a>, put out by Americans For Prosperity, a group partly funded by the energy billionaire Koch brothers, says that Obama is trying to do away with coal that has provided \"opportunities for our children and our communities\".</p> <p>Another, put out by the American Energy Alliance, <a href=\"http://www.americanenergyalliance.org/\">accuses the Obama administration of causing coal mines to close</a> all across the country through the imposition of environmental regulations. \"The president and his Washington cronies have declared war on affordable energy and American jobs,\" the soundtrack says.</p> <p>A similar strategy is being pursued throughout the Appalachian coal areas. <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/forms/crushed-your-policies\">A new advert</a> implying that Obama was responsible for the imminent closure or conversion of 22 coal facilities in Pennsylvania was just launched on the TV screens of that state's coal communities this week.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama won seven out of the 18 Ohio counties that produce coal \u2013 an achievement that surpassed the record of any of his Democratic predecessors. In Harrison county, which covers Cadiz and the Resources mine, Obama polled 47% four years ago to John McCain's 50%, a near-parity that reflected a strong Democratic tradition in the locality strengthened by a vibrant trade union membership among coal miners and steel workers.</p> <p>Romney's challenge is to beat back Obama's showing in the region on 6 November. Hence the focus of the Republican campaign on the new Environmental Protection Agency regulations <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2010/apr/01/obama-administration-mining?INTCMP=SRCH\">introduced in 2010 by the<br>Obama administration</a>.</p> <p>The regulations are designed to reduce pollution and global warming emissions from coal-fired power plants, and to limit the damage to rivers and scenery caused by mountaintop mining, or surface mining as locals prefer to call it: the crude technique of blasting out hundreds of feet of hillside to reach seams of coal. The method is heavily used in the Appalachian coal areas that cross Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.</p> <p>Some of the new regulations have already been put on hold as a result of legal challenges. Local coal mines and coal-burning power plants are also facing fierce competition from natural gas production that is booming in Appalachia as a result of the advent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign has glossed over those inconvenient truths, blaming recent closures of coal-fired stations entirely on Obama's fetish for regulation. There are signs that the strategy might be working.</p> <p>For the first time since 1972 the <a href=\"http://www.umwa.org/?q=compac\">United Mine Workers of America has decided not to endorse a presidential candidate this year</a>, having backed Obama in 2008. In Cadiz, the mantra of the \"war on coal\" appears also to be enjoying some purchase.</p> <p>Ed Sobolawski, a retired steel worker, has voted as a Democrat all his adult life. This year though, for the first time, he is having doubts.</p> <p>\"To tell you the truth, I haven't decided what I'm going to vote. I keep switching back and forth,\" he said.</p> <p>We meet in a barn on the outskirts of Cadiz where Sobolawski is having an annual \"fry\" with friends from the neighbourhood. A group of about 10 men \u2013 mainly retired coal and steel workers \u2013 have assembled to eat side bacon, drink moonshine that one of them procured on the black market in Kentucky, chew on chewing tobacco and talk about the much-vaunted war on coal.</p> <p>\"I feel bad for the coal miners. So many are losing their jobs. Kids round here don't stick around \u2013 they all leave the area to find work,\" he said.</p> <p>Among the lunch gatherers is Bill Spiker, who used to be chief executive of a local coal mine. He says he is sympathetic to the idea that mining has to be regulated \u2013 he remembers in his youth how the open strip mines around here tore up huge swathes of countryside without any attempt to reclaim it; and he approves of the federal government's insistence on returning spent mines to something approximating a natural condition.</p> <p>But he argues that Obama has taken the regulations too far. \"He's regulated the coal industry just about out of existence. He doesn't like the coal industry so he's regulating it to death,\" Spiker said.</p> <p>There's a common sentiment that connects the mine workers of the Resources mine and the retired friends gathered at their annual fry: they all feel got at. Their way of life is under siege, as they see it, from tree-hugging environmentalists and coastal do-gooders, with Obama cast in the role of regulator-in-chief.</p> <p>That sense of beleaguerment is being put to powerful political use by Mitt Romney, backed by his supporters in the coal industry. Lost in the argument is the fact that the number of workers employed in the coal mining industry, contrary to the message being delivered locally, has actually gone up since 2008, from 77,000 to 82,000.</p> <p>Lost, too, is Obama's attempt to promote new technologies behind clean coal, and Romney's own record of flip-flopping on the issue. As governor of Massachusetts he insisted on a coal-burning power station abiding by strict emissions rules, saying: \"\"I will not create jobs or hold jobs that kill people, and that plant kills people.\"</p> <p>Lost, above, all is any talk about climate change and the long-term need to reduce emissions caused by non-clean coal. Back at the coal mine, Trent Sigman said emphatically that he doesn't believe in global warming: \"It's just something that occurs naturally over so many years, so they are using that for political reasons.\"</p> <p>The group of miners around him nodded in agreement.</p>",
  "<p>Looking back on <a href=\"http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Creative England's</a> first 12 months, it's easy to see and celebrate the big things we've achieved: working with 500 companies; investing over \u00a3500,000 in new and emerging talent, and securing \u00a35m from the government's Regional Growth Fund to invest in digital and creative businesses. These are all reasons to believe we're heading in the right direction, but however good these facts are, it is just as useful to reflect on the little things \u2013 small yet significant.</p> <p>Just as George Bailey in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJfZaT8ncYk\" title=\"\">It's a Wonderful Life</a> gets to see a world in which he didn't exist, it's a good exercise for us to see what would have happened (or not happened) if our organisations had never been born. What little, but vital things would not have been put in place?</p> <p>The roots of Creative England are the regional screen agencies. Small, lean, tightly focused organisations set up in 2001 to initially facilitate the development of filmmaking outside of London, but which over time grew to invest in and support other types of screen businesses: TV, digital media and games.</p> <p>Those agencies are now consolidated under Creative England with our first ambition to preserve those close contacts with talent and businesses on the ground at a local level. This is a hard task \u2013 money is tight and our start-up budget was easily a third of what was there in 2001. However, we've adopted a distributed approach, with teams working throughout the country to achieve it.</p> <p>The added value of now being one national organisation is that our voice gets heard, and this means that local experience also gets recognised. For example, in our first year we secured \u00a35m to invest in new digital businesses in hard-hit areas of the English regions. As one body we have far more visibility; it's easier to have a direct relationship with the government and be the voice that articulates the needs of our businesses.</p> <p>And this \"voice\" is underpinned by practical, on the ground help. In the last few months we've built and launched all-England crew and location databases, to not only support UK television and film production but also attract overseas producers. We've put on crew nights bringing together 1,400 crew members in cities outside London. Increasingly as more and more of us work on a freelance basis the need to meet others, make new contacts for work or just share stories becomes harder. It's a little thing, but just bringing people together is one of the most effective things we can do.</p> <p>Far too many creative businesses are both under-capitalised and under-skilled. We recognise that <a href=\"http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/index.php/portfolio/developing-talent/\" title=\"\">talent development</a> and <a href=\"http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/index.php/portfolio/business-support/\" title=\"\">business development</a> have to go hand in hand to create a successful, sustainable enterprise. That's why we offer what we call a 'money plus' service that combines mentoring and business support with access to finance and access to markets. Our view is that in the networked economy every micro-business can think of itself as a global business, wherever it's located, providing it takes the time to build the knowledge and relationships it needs for success.</p> <p>The foundation of all creative businesses is good ideas, but getting a shot at turning those good ideas into a new format, a new product or a new application is hard. The small investments we've been able to make to fund proof-of-concept proposals and prototypes can really make the difference, turning an idea into a revenue-generating proposition.</p> <p>In our talent development area too, as well as launching <a href=\"http://ifeatures2.co.uk/\" title=\"\">iFeatures2</a> (our initiative supporting filmmakers to make their first feature film) we've also created new, bespoke approaches such as <a href=\"http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/index.php/2012/news-creative-england-launches-elevator-skills-programme/\" title=\"\">Elevator</a>. This tailor-made programme aims to help talented filmmakers bridge the significant gap between making short films and features, giving them access to mentors, festivals and opportunities to help them further their career.</p> <p>We've also recently partnered with the <a href=\"http://nftsfilm-tv.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">National Film and Television School</a> to offer two bursaries on the Entrepreneurial Producing diploma for producers based in the English regions \u2013 an intervention which is small in scope, but potentially very significant in the longer term.</p> <p>One thing that underpins all these interventions is a belief that, although the creative industries have weathered the recession better than many other sectors, it is unlikely they'll continue to thrive without future support and development. We believe that great ideas don't become great businesses by magic \u2013 they need support, they need investment and they need routes to market.</p> <p>Another thing they need is willing partners. It is not our plan to be a new massive public agency, more one that can build connections and draw in fellow travellers to help us on our journey. We've made a good start in our first year \u2013 more than just the first few steps.</p> <p><em>Caroline Norbury is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.creativeengland.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Creative England</em></a><em> \u2013 follow both on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarolineNorbury\" title=\"\"><em>@CarolineNorbury</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/creativeengland\" title=\"\"><em>@CreativeEngland</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The stand-off between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/29/climate-activists-west-burton-gas\" title=\"\">climate change protesters perched high on two power station chimneys</a> and police encircling the plant below is continuing in spite of high winds.</p> <p>Clinging to metal railings near the top of the 91m (300ft) water cooling tower at EDF's new gas-fired power station at West Burton in Nottingamshire, the group said that they were concentrating on stopping their tarpaulin shelter from blowing away.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nodashforgas/status/263550277787992065\" title=\"\">tweeting a dawn picture</a> of the second occupied chimney with the River Trent winding behind, they linked the fierce gusts to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\" title=\"\">Wednesday's political row over wind power</a>, suggesting that the huge West Burton complex would be \"an ideal site for a windfarm.\"</p> <p>Ewa Jasiewicz, one of 11 people occupying the plant's central chimney, said: \"It's really seriously windy up here and we're really seriously upset by this nonsense today about stopping windfarms. People often say that this country is the 'Saudi Arabia of wind power' and it's unforgivable that the Conservative side of the coalition seems to be going against that. It's completely out of step with all thinking on cutting carbon and using sustainable power.\"</p> <p>Workers from EDF, which is trialling the \u00a3600m gas station before connection to the national grid, have started building temporary fences round the central tower and one of its two neighbours which is also occupied by another five protesters. The central tower was working on test power generation until the No Dash for Gas group moved in at around 1am on Monday 29 October. The other occupied tower is not complete and has not yet been used.</p> <p>Police are on the site and have been trying to maintain a dialogue with the protesters and persuade them to come down. Jasiewicz said: \"We have made it clear that we intend to stay up here for days and also that we will give ourselves up when we do come down and we will not carry out any criminal damage.\"</p> <p>Nottinghamshire police warned late on Monday that their operation could cost over \u00a3200,000 if the protest continued for more than a week, and the local Labour MP for Bassetlaw, John Mann, attacked the \"waste of money by pseudo-environmentalists\". The protesters countered that there was no need for any more than a few constables to arrest them when they came down.</p> <p>Jasiewicz said: \"The police only get excited when we make a move \u2013 for instance, we had to rescue our kite from the roof of a nearby building last night. Sadly, the wind is much too high for our original plan of using the kite to rig a line between the two occupied chimneys. The direction it's blowing, it would be easy to get it to the other chimney but that's the only one of the three which isn't occupied.\"</p> <p>The confrontation remains largely good-natured, with laughing and joking on both sides during the kite recovery. But Jasiewicz said that officers appeared to be searching nearby fields in a way which would deter supporters or sightseers from getting close to the largely inaccessible site. The protesters continue to take turns to occupy a platform hanging inside the flue of the chimney, which is sheltered from the wind.</p> <p>Five women from Leeds and Manchester are on police bail after they were arrested early on Monday morning on suspicion of aggravated trespass, when a helicopter with a searchlight assisted a search of ground floor buildings at the plant.</p> <p>EDF has confirmed that the plant will remain shut until the protesters come down, which has increased their determination to stay put as long as possible. They have reinforced their flimsy tarpaulin cabin with wood, scaffolding poles and ladders.</p> <p>No Dash for Gas said that more than 30 campaigners had got on to the West Burton site on Monday through a gap in fences which are a long walk from nearby roads with the River Trent, drainage dykes and the power station's railway line also impeding access. Sixteen remain on the two chimneys and five have been bailed after being arrested on the ground. The remaining nine got away.</p> <p>The group said: \"The occupiers have so far prevented 2,371 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions a day by shutting down the one working chimney. This is equivalent to the energy that an average home uses for 182 years, or taking 465 cars off the road for a year. As the human and economic costs of hurricane Sandy become clearer, the need to take action on climate change and avoid many more instances of such extreme weather-related disasters has never been more pressing.\"</p> <p>Another chimney percher, Anneka Kelly, said over one the mobile phones which are being kept powered-up by a solar panel and wind-up generator: \"The government, at the behest of the big six energy companies, wants to build 20 new gas power stations.

Progress on the MDGs has been mixed, however, with persistent inequalities both within and between countries.</p> <p>We've pulled together the key data on the eight goals. Although the MDG framework may seem overly technical, with its dozens of time-bound, results-based targets and indicators, it's the product of very political negotiations, with some issues receiving more attention and prominence than others.</p> <h2><strong>Goal 1) Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</strong></h2> <p>Estimates suggest the MDG target to halve the proportion of people living in \"extreme poverty\" <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:23129612~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html\" title=\"\">was met in 2010</a>, five years ahead of the 2015 deadline.

  "<p>Despite her reputation as a \"romantic novelist\", a label the author herself always chafed against, <a href=\"http://www.dumaurier.org/\" title=\"\">Daphne du Maurier </a>wrote two of the most menacing tales of 20th-century fiction \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/may/05/fiction.daphnedumaurier\" title=\"\">The Birds</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/sep/22/dont-look-now-daphne-du-maurier\" title=\"\">Don't Look Now</a>. Bearing out the perceived wisdom that short stories \u2013 in particular, scary stories \u2013 make the best films, these short masterpieces are better-known today as the movies they inspired: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/jul/31/my-favourite-hitchcock-the-birds\" title=\"\">Hitchcock's infamous 1963 avian thriller</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/oct/22/dont-look-now-roeg-horror\" title=\"\">Nicholas Roeg's darkly erotic 1973 Don't Look Now</a>. (Du Maurier hated the former, apparently, disapproving of the many liberties Hitchcock took, but gave her blessing to Roeg's more faithful version of her later story). Deeply unsettling as these films are (a line of birds on a climbing frame, or a glimpse of a little girl's red coat), the stories can be equally chilling on the page \u2013 if not more so.</p> <p>Du Maurier's are not supernatural tales (she doesn't do real ghosts, so to speak); what could be more unnerving than nature behaving unnaturally? Not in the form of apocalyptic diseases, or storms and floods, but wreaking havoc through something as everyday and unthreatening as hedgerow birds. Environment is everything in Du Maurier's fiction, from the sinister alleyways of Venice in Don't Look Now, to the wilderness of her beloved Cornwall, where, like nearly all her most famous work, The Birds is set. In transposing the action to the tamer shores of northern California (no wonder Du Maurier was miffed), the film loses some of the elemental potency of the tale. And there is no place for the icily immaculate Tippi Hedren, fresh from the city, in Du Maurier's vision: as in Don't Look Now, the story is narrated entirely from the perspective of the male father figure \u2013 both stories deliberately set the rationality of their outlook against the irrational goings-on around them.</p> <p>The story starts quietly enough. Nat Hocken, a part-time farm labourer, is eating his lunch (a pasty, naturally) on a cliff on the Cornish peninsula, watching the restless birds gathering in the autumnal skies above him and enjoying the last glow of the sun. \"No wind, and the grey sea calm and full. Campion in bloom yet in the hedges, and the air mild.\" But Hocken, a man of the soil, alive to the fickleness of nature, senses that the weather is about to turn, that winter is coming and that it will be a hard, black one. \"Make haste, make speed, hurry and begone,\" he thinks to the birds, in an ominous line straight out of a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/21/grimms-fairy-tales-philip-pullman\" title=\"\">Grimms' fairytale</a>.</p> <p>Later that evening, tucked up in bed next to his sleeping wife (nameless throughout), he is filled with a sense of apprehension and foreboding, like John at the beginning of Don't Look Now, suddenly \"aware of misgiving without cause\". The tension, like the birds' presence, is masterfully built through careful accretion. There is a tapping on the window (that ghost story staple!) and when Nat goes to investigate a bird nips him on the knuckles, but he goes back to bed without giving it a second thought. The tapping returns, this time more forcefully, waking his wife. Now there is not one bird on the sill but half a dozen. This time when he tries to shoo them away they attack him, pecking at his eyes. In a pattern that is repeated throughout the story, his wife doesn't believe him at first.</p> <p>Then there is a terrified cry from their children's bedroom. The room is full of birds, and Nat feels \"the beating of wings about him in the darkness\" (just reading it makes you inwardly flail and cower) as he beats the birds to death with a blanket. In the \"cold, grey morning light\" the floor is strewn with the tiny corpses of almost 50 birds, all small species \u2013 \"robins, finches, sparrows, blue tits, larks and bramblings, birds that by nature's law kept to their own flock and their own territory\". Nature's law has been broken and Nat immediately divines some sort of intelligence or purpose among the birds in their \"battle\" against people.</p> <p>Over the next 30 or so pages the birds continue to multiply, by the hundreds and thousands until the sky is black with them, and the species grow in size and malevolence: first small garden birds, then rooks, crows, jackdaws, magpies, jays; then gulls and gannets; finally, and most horribly, the birds of prey \u2013 accompanied by the ever-increasing sounds of tapping, stabbing, scratching, rasping, tearing, shuffling and beating. The sickening cacophony of the birds in attack is starkly contrasted with the eerie silence of them in abeyance, as Nat, a country man, is quick to link their sorties with the turns of the tide. During these brief respites, he must survey the damage and shore up the house against the inevitable next attack.</p> <p>This is the story of one man trying to protect his family from the external world as he barricades every window, doorway and chimney. The sense of nature being turned upside down is made clear when the little boy remarks that it is night-time at two o'clock in the afternoon, so dark is it in their stone cottage. The only other characters are a neighbouring farmer, his wife and a farmhand \u2013 all gruesomely punished for their flippancy towards the birds.</p> <p>The film doesn't quite capture the same palpable sense of isolation and claustrophobia. The homeliness of the interior \u2013 \"the cups and saucers neatly stacked upon the dresser\u2026 his wife's roll of knitting on her basket chair, the children's toys in a corner cupboard\" \u2013 and their comforting everyday meals \u2013 tea and cocoa, toasted cheese and soup \u2013 serve only to heighten the sense of chaos and danger outside. Nat's attempt to disguise his own fear and create some semblance of order \u2013 add to the terror. \"Manners Johnny\", reproaches the little boy's sister one mealtime, even as the birds begin to thud against the windowpane with renewed urgency.</p> <p>\"Someone should know of this\u2026 They ought to do something\" is a refrain that echoes throughout the story. Perhaps the most chilling moments of all are those when we realise that people in authority do know, and \"they\" are doing something \u2013 but that all attempts are futile. You know you are in trouble when even the BBC goes silent \u2013 something, Nat observes, that didn't even happen during the war.</p> <p>Du Maurier passes no opportunity to mention the war: Nat banks up the house like an air-raid shelter; fighter planes set off across the channel to be tragically outnumbered and end in burning heaps on the cliff tops, and the birds flying \"in formation\" towards land. In a nod to the Cold War era in which it was written: \"The Russians have poisoned the birds,\" reports the neighbouring farmer's wife of the town's gossip.</p> <p>There is no explanation for the nightmarish events, not why the birds began their own merciless war, or when, if or how it might end. It's an unconsoling ambiguity that Hitchcock, apparently after some indecision, did not attempt to resolve in the film, to chilling effect. Like Don't Look Now, the story closes with terrible banality.</p> <p>If you only know the film version, track down a copy of Du Maurier's collected stories. And if you are already familiar with the story itself, dig it out again. What better time to reread it than just as the weather has turned arctic, and the promise of a hard, black winter is upon us?</p>",
  "<p>If you could bottle an 'employability potion' for graduates, you'd probably stand a good chance on Dragons' Den. But what is it and how can young people acquire it? And whose responsibility is it to develop it?</p> <p>It's true that universities need to play a stronger role as nurturers of employable, self-aware 'can-doers', not just of subject-specific learners. Employability stats will become harder to ignore as they compete for graduate attention. Meanwhile, over in camp business, employers are slowly inching towards offering more internships and apprenticeships to take some responsibility for preparing the future leaders for the world of work. But it's still not enough; the gap between the two worlds is alarmingly wide.</p> <p>The longer-term problem is the under-employment of talented, capable young adults who are treading water in very limited roles. Graduates are typically heading for a working life of 10,000 days and who'd want to spend them in the wrong job, wondering what the right job is? There is a real danger that they will stay in those roles for too long hoping for (but not knowing how to reach) that light-bulb career direction moment.</p> <p>To escape this trap, it's crucial that graduates find practical ways to help themselves transfer from student to employee. We cannot ignore the importance of translating education into meaningful skills and capabilities for the workplace. So where do you start?</p> <p>We need to turn the idea of soft and hard skills on its head. Young adults' people skills are essential. Decision-making, excellent writing skills, team working, presentation and articulation, empathy, reflection, curiosity and listening are some of the skills being demanded by all organisations, not just corporations. Many graduates have these skills; they just don't know it. As a largely digital generation, their inter-personal skills are dramatically variable, from listening brilliantly and taking on board feedback, to dialogue and empathy.</p> <p>Secondly, far more graduates need to realise the importance of preparation and genuine self-awareness. Both over-used words, both severely under-practised in reality by most candidates. Actors delivering electrifying performances night after night on stage and athletes competing for their life's dreams on the track don't get there without digging deep into themselves and understanding what drives them. Employers regularly say they need candidates who are more self-aware, who understand exactly what they have to offer their chosen industry and how to offer it.</p> <p>Graduates preparing for make or break interviews must first go through the process of identifying what really matters to them, what drives them in life. We encourage graduates to be honest about what they really believe in, what their values are. This is far more important than pretending to be what you think an employer wants and it comes even before all the other vital work that the more conscientious candidates will put into physical aspects of their behaviour like posture, expression and presence.</p> <p>Explore your own 'currencies' and identify what makes you come alive. Apply the same discipline you may have in a sporting or cultural passion to your career aims. Analyse this properly before being interviewed for a dream job in your target industry and you're far more likely to convince an employer that you are right for the role.</p> <p>Young people need a place to bring these issues to the surface in a safe environment, allowing themselves to admit vulnerabilities and express what makes them uncomfortable as well as what drives them. Understanding what gets in the way of progressing is absolutely key to this.</p> <p>It's not obvious where to look for this help but there are solutions out there. Many private coaching providers will focus on individual aspects \u2013 presentation, interviews, CV, assertiveness, appropriate grooming for the job. But being in a place that brings all this together \u2013 where young adults can learn how all these exercises blend and how to tell their story in a more compelling way \u2013 is much more effective.</p> <p>Pockets of excellent advice and guidance are offered by some universities, but most often we hear stories of careers services that aren't connecting with the majority of students. While online learning is affordable and scalable, is it genuinely effective?</p> <p>A back-to-basics, intensive coaching experience involving leaders from all walks of life would seem like a sensible place to start. After all, coaching is no longer the preserve of the boardroom or of elite sports men and women. We're about to take on this challenge and help graduates from across the UK tackle all the issues above with the launch of <a href=\"http://www.ewopened.com/\" title=\"\">Eyes Wide Opened</a>, the first ever five-day coaching course for under-employed graduates.</p> <p>But there shouldn't just be one place to turn. This concept is worth developing by everyone, so that employability is attainable by the majority and the danger of spending those 10,000 days wishing you were somewhere else is dramatically reduced for everyone's sake.</p> <p><em>Alastair Creamer and Paul Preston are co-founders of </em><a href=\"http://www.ewopened.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Eyes Wide Opened</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

He was quoted as saying the number of wind turbines in the UK \"seems extraordinary\", and \"we can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities\".</p> <p>A source said the minister had planned to make the remarks in a speech on Tuesday night but was instructed to remove them by Davey if he wanted to deliver a speech.</p> <p>The source said: \"What he planned to say was not government policy; will not be government policy. It might be what the Tory party would like to be energy policy, but it is not. He is not in charge of renewable policies on his own: he has to follow the coalition agreement, which is in favour of renewable energy and meeting our legal EU targets for 2020.</p> <p>\"He has been very silly to give interviews to the Telegraph and the Mail on a speech he was not allowed to deliver.</p> <p>\"The only way we are going to meet our targets is if we include renewable energy which is ultimately a cheap form of energy, and in parts of Wales and Scotland is popular.\"</p> <p>Decc concedes that if the number of onshore windfarms already built, those under construction, and those in the pipeline seeking construction are built, the UK will probably have enough onshore farms to meet its renewable targets. But the source said it was entirely wrong to say at this stage that no more windfarms will be built.</p> <p>Davey has taken control of renewable strategy from Hayes, and left the Tory minister with responsibility for delivery.</p> <p>Hayes was returning this morning from Scotland to hold discussions with Davey amid signs that a frank discussion is going to be necessary to smooth over relations and construct an alliance around the forthcoming energy bill.</p> <p>In the newspaper interviews, Hayes said: \"I can't single-handedly build a new Jerusalem but I can protect our green and pleasant land.\"</p> <p>He continued: \"If you look at what has been built, what has consent and what is in the planning system, much of it will not get through and will be rejected. Even if a minority of what's in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 [renewable energy] target \u2026 I'm saying enough is enough.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/video/2012/oct/31/david-cameron-policy-renewable-energy-video\">David Cameron tried to draw a line under the dispute</a> at prime minister's questions in the Commons, insisting there had been no change in government policy.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said there were enough wind farms in existence or in the pipeline for the government to meet its EU imposed targets on renewable energy, and stressed that the current subsidies can be changed in the future.</p> <p>In an official statement, Davey said: \"There has been no change to government policy on renewable energy, as collectively agreed by the coalition cabinet. We set out in the renewable energy roadmap in July 2011 how we expect to reach our target of getting 30% of all UK electricity from renewable sources by 2020.</p> <p>\"We've put in place support to bring on growth in new industries to deploy the technologies needed to diversify our energy mix in the most cost-effective way. There are no targets \u2013 or caps \u2013 for individual renewable technologies such as onshore wind. Nor are there reviews being done of onshore wind on the basis of landscape or property values.</p> <p>\"What we're currently consulting on are ways of making sure local communities feel the benefit of hosting windfarms, and whether our understanding of future costs is accurate.</p> <p>\"Onshore wind is one of the cheapest renewables, which is why we've been able to cut the subsidy. It has an important role to play in our energy future.\"</p> <p>Caroline Flint, Davey's Labour shadow, has said the Tory-Lib Dem row over windfarms shows that the UK has \"a shambles of a Tory-led government which can't even agree with itself\".</p> <p>Flint said: \"Onshore wind is the most developed and cheapest source of clean energy. If the government tries robbing Peter to pay Paul and cuts support for wind power, it could leave the public with even higher bills.\"</p> <p>The row came as the renewable energy industry met in Glasgow for <a href=\"http://www.renewable-uk.com/events/annual-conference/\" title=\"\">its annual conference</a>.</p> <p>Trade body RenewableUK's deputy chief executive, Maf Smith, said: \"As the wind industry meets in Glasgow to celebrate the success of this industry, it comes as some surprise that the new minister has said one thing to us and another to the press. We are on the eve of the publication of the energy bill, a crucial time for energy policy, with huge investment decisions to be made that will lead to tens of thousands of jobs over the next decade. If we are to see these jobs and investment realised confidence must be retained and that means consistency.\"</p> <p>Last month, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/23/tory-tea-party-threat-green-energy-jobs\" title=\"\">Davey said</a> the Tory \"Tea Party\" tendency was threatening green investment in the UK, and a group of global wind and nuclear companies <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3561457.ece\" title=\"\">warned earlier this month</a> that political uncertainty was threatening millions in investment.</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian yesterday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/30/energy-strategy-renewables\" title=\"\">Hayes said</a> \"our long-term goal is to enable renewables to compete against other forms of low-carbon generation without subsidy\" but in the same comment piece praised the renewable energy sector for creating 20,000 jobs over the last year. The number of onshore windfarms built over the past year <a href=\"http://www.renewableuk.com/en/publications/index.cfm/SOI2012\" title=\"\">will be worth \u00a3737m to the economy over their lifetime</a>, according to RenewableUK.</p> <p>The Tories and Lib Dems have had a series of run-ins over wind power this year, starting with <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9061997/101-Tories-revolt-over-wind-farms.html\" title=\"\">a letter by 101 Tory MPs</a> demanding an end to onshore wind subsidies and culminating in a fight in the summer over the level of subsidy cuts, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/24/victory-libdems-onshore-wind-subsidies\" title=\"\">which Davey eventually won</a> by securing a 10% cut rather than the 25% that Chancellor George Osborne had wanted.</p> <p>Responding to Hayes's attack on windfarms, Greenpeace energy campaigner Leila Deen said: \"John Hayes's petulant outburst adds to the coalition's growing energy shambles and to a deepening divide within government between those who care about green growth and the economy and those who just want more oil and gas.</p> <p>\"Here is a new minister veering off-brief and publicly contradicting his bosses. His comments threaten jobs and his approach will drive up energy bills.</p> <p>\"Cameron needs to take charge, decide whose side he's on and reassure industry and investors that John Hayes won't go over their heads and make policy over the phone to the Daily Mail.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord (Michael) Heseltine has a special place in the heart of the <em>Northerner</em>; indeed he's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/mar/13/michael-heseltine-liverpool-freeman-margaret-thatcher\">practically our patron saint</a>.</p> <p>How good, therefore to see him <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/heseltine-report-blasts-coalition-growth\">making headlines with another call for action </a>on genuine regional devolution, of the sort which made his influence so important to the north in Margaret Thatcher's years.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/heseltine-review\">review of competitiveness, <em>No Stone Unturned</em></a>, laments the abolition of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10391326\">regional development agencies </a>and calls for their successors such as the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/regeneration/pdf/143855.pdf\">City Regions</a> and the 39 <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/economic-development/leps\">Local Enterprise Partnerships</a> to be beefed up, not just with money (though that is fundamental) but with powers and responsibility as well. You can read Michael White's largely approving <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/oct/31/michael-heseltine-plan-h\">take on the suggestions here</a>, and a more sceptical analysis from Karel Williams of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/31/lord-heseltine-britain-ex-industrial-regions\">Manchester Business School here.</a> Williams makes good cautionary points, but Heseltine is surely a vast improvement on everything else around which has some chance of acceptance by the current government.</p> <p>Here's some regional reaction to be going on with, universally approving. James Ramsbotham chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.necc.co.uk/\">North East Chambers of Commerce</a> says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord Heseltine is spot-on to say the UK needs to have a relentless focus on competitiveness, and is spot on to say that real competitiveness requires all parts of the country to fulfill their potential.<br>&#xa0;<br>We firmly believe the North East economy is a huge asset that could and should be developed further. That requires national policies that take better account of regional differences, and more local control of our own destiny.<br>&#xa0;<br>It would be a huge missed opportunity if the response to this important report is to get mired in a lengthy debate over reorganising institutions. We need in the region to quickly get on with tackling the issues of infrastructure development, better procurement, swifter planning and growing exports which Lord Heseltine rightly identifies.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Liberal Democrats failed to ride to the rescue of the RDAs; and it is no doubt true that regionalism does not set the electorate alight, athough it should. But here's <a href=\"http://timfarron.co.uk/\">Tim Farron</a> applauding unstintingly from his Cumbrian constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The report produced by Lord Heseltine advocates what many of us locally have been calling on for years. There is no one in Whitehall who will be able to understand how money to help the local economy should be spent in Cumbria, better than Cumbrians<br>&#xa0;<br>Many people have claimed that this is a critical report of the economic plan the Government has put together so far. However I see this as an opportunity to extend the work already being done to hand more power back to local people, local authorities and local bodies. Ensuring the <a href=\"http://www.cumbrialep.co.uk/\">Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership</a> has more power to decide how money should be spent in our local area would be a much needed step forward for our county.</p> </blockquote> <p>And finally, for now, the chair of<a href=\"http://www.leedscityregion.gov.uk/lcr-lep/\"> Leeds City region's LEP</a>, Neil McLean says this: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lord Heseltine's report is includes some bold, transformative proposals that would be a step-change in enabling places like Leeds City Region to take charge of their own economic destiny. The devolution of real powers and significant, flexible budgets to LEPs would cement the progress we have made with our City Deal, with future investment in all areas key to growth driven by local decisions and following local priorities.</p> <p>In the Leeds City Region we would also be confident in facing Lord Heseltine's radical proposal of a competition between LEPs for this devolved funding. Whether or not Government embraces that, I urge them to respond positively to the thrust of his recommendations to give LEPs extra flexibility and firepower to deliver on our ambitions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>What do you think? And can we help make it happen?</strong></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb\" title=\"\">Radio 4's Woman's Hour</a> is a reliable source of rational discussion and interviews that has captivated listeners for almost 70 years. So why is it clinging on to social relevance by touting a pseudo-feminist poll on the subject of female authority? <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/womans-hour/power-list/\" title=\"\">The Woman's Hour Power List</a> was launched yesterday; it is a list of the 100 most powerful women in the UK, as suggested by listeners and judged by a panel of generic respected women \u2013 amongst them Conservative MP <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priti_Patel\" title=\"\">Priti Patel</a>, crime writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_McDermid\" title=\"\">Val McDermid</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Porter\" title=\"\">Dawn O'Porter</a> (she's younger, and therefore culturally relevant, right?).</p> <p>So, what exactly is the point of the power list? We already know that girls run the world (that gambit came courtesy of Beyonc\u00e9, not a radio polemic). Doesn't Forbes already have the whole <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/power-women/\" title=\"\">powerful women</a> list thing covered? A list like theirs makes more sense on a global scale \u2013 here are women who we know have power, the Hilary Clintons and Christine Lagardes of the world. Moreover, there's an irony in being implored to vote for the most powerful women in our society \u2013 if their power was anything more than wholly perceived, then surely we would be able to identify them without the help of a list. Why then, is the poll looking for the most powerful women? What is the fixation with power over influence, or something more quantifiable?</p> <p>The power list is unfortunately not a groundbreaking piece of anthropological research. It is a perfunctory women's magazine feature rebranded for the thinking man's crumpet \u2013 a way to praise already established figures in areas including retail, sport and media. The focus in said commercial magazine awards seems to be to gaining exposure for yourself; on the website of one glossy, the winner of a similar award describes her own business plan as \"extraordinary\". How is that in any way objective and/or helpful to potential entrepreneurs? What advice could this woman actively be giving in lieu of this empty discussion of her own successes?</p> <p>Ranking yourself against others is just something that humans do, but coupled with vanity and a need to defy the negative connotations of female success (read: she's a bitch!), the power list may just read as a confused collection of people who a) actually do possess the power to bring about any type of change, whether that be social, cultural, political or otherwise, like activists and business owners and b) people who are perceived to have power, but are in fact just celebrities. Tweeters have already asked the BBC to make sure that female scientists are included, but do these people fit the bill? Are they egocentric enough to put themselves forward, or have someone else recognise their potential as a \"powerful woman\"?</p> <p>Running a glorified popularity contest isn't going to help women to find out what power really means. It's not even going to get the best-equipped people in the country in direct contact with women to mentor, advise, help and inspire them. It's going to keep them up on a pedestal, rather than dropping that pedestal and finding ways to bring interesting figures in contact with the huge audience that the BBC has. Wouldn't you rather have an <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/undercover-boss/\" title=\"\">Undercover Boss</a> or a <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-secret-millionaire\" title=\"\">Secret Millionaire</a> getting their hands dirty? Isn't that a more healthy way to treat power \u2013 to concentrate it rather than focus on consolidating it as part of a PR exercise?</p> <p>The BBC can help women. At the moment it is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/news/view/female_experts_day_attend\" title=\"\">looking for experts</a> in fields including science and engineering to become TV presenters, allowing a route into the media for new and informed talent. The power list, however, seems to serve no real objective. It's about as culturally relevant as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kony_2012\" title=\"\">Kony 2012</a>, and unfortunately it threatens to make Woman's Hour into a powerless London-centric talking shop rather than a place for high-quality programming. Yes, we should celebrate the efforts of women. But patronising them with pointless tokenism only goes to show who holds the true power when it comes to our perception of womanhood. Joining in with this navel-gazing will only make the BBC come up with more lazy ideas rather than finding ways to get even more female voices heard, and in touch with one another.</p>",
  "<p>As the flood waters recede and the states hit by Sandy start the grim task of mopping up, many questions remain, among them: how big an impact will the storm and its fallout have on the US economy?</p> <p>The short answer is: tens of billions of dollars, in damage, lost output and disruption to entire industries. And despite some optimistic forecasts made a day after Sandy moved inland, there are good reasons to think the final tally may be worse than expected.</p> <p>The devastation caused by Sandy comes at a critical time for the US economy as a whole, which seems to be on a slow march out of the doldrums, even if its pace is too slow for the millions out of work, and for Barack Obama's political fortunes.</p> <p>Luckily, in that sense alone, Sandy's landfall came too late for its wrath to be felt in the the economic data published before the presidential election, although the delays and confusion may yet cause the bureau of labour statistics to delay publication of its critical jobs report for October, scheduled to come out on Friday. Even if the BLS's number-crunchers can finish their work in time, the two-day outage on the eastern seaboard will put an asterix on the jobs numbers.</p> <p>The real effect won't be felt for several weeks, and it may be months and even years before the final cost of Sandy is calculated.</p> <p>The initial estimates take the usual response to a major natural disaster: yes, there will be losses caused by damage but these will be largely offset by the stimulus of rebuilding. Much lost production will be made up in subsequent weeks as companies and workers catch up with any backlog, while the consumer spending foregone by the days lost to the storm will be merely displaced to later dates or other avenues. Some sectors, such as tourism and transportation, will have permanent losses \u2013 empty hotel rooms and airline seats caused by cancelled bookings can't be resold later \u2013 but that effect will be brief and limited to the peak of the storm.</p> <p>That was the case with Hurricane Irene, which hit the area over a year ago and caused insured property damage worth $4.3bn, according to the Insurance Information Institute. But Sandy had a far bigger impact on the region, and hit a wider area. It may be that the final bill is well in excess of the early numbers being talked about on Tuesday.</p> <p>One of the first estimates was from Gregory Daco and Nigel Gault of IHS Global Insight, which said said early calculations of infrastructure damage was for losses worth $20bn. Lost economic activity could boost the overall total to $30bn-$50bn.</p> <p>Yet the final tally could be much higher for several reasons. The first is that much of the eastern seaboard \u2013 densely populated and containing some of the wealthiest areas in America \u2013 was at a virtual standstill for two entire days, as well as the federal government shut down and oil production along the entire coast being interrupted. Those things will help knock a chuck off GDP for the fourth quarter, perhaps 0.5 percentage points, at a time when growth is already slow.</p> <p>Then there is the scope of the rebuilding operation. The scale of damage may be far higher than initial estimates expected, because of the destruction in New Jersey that is still coming to light. That includes both private property and federal and state infrastructure.</p> <p>It is impossible to know at this stage what the economic impact of the destruction and damage to New York's transportation network will cause, over and above the cost of repairing the infrastructure itself. Simply closing the New York City subway for a week alone will have knock-on effects on output, tourism and even employment. Some are talking of up to six weeks before the full network is secured, and the longer the network is closed, the larger the costs will be.</p> <p>New York City does have one recent illustration of how economic losses can be far worse than first anticipated: the tragic events of 11 September, 2001. Like Sandy, it did huge damage in the city's financial district, and a cleaning-up operation that lasted for years. Initial estimates of $38bn in insurance claims later shot up to $52bn. The city was expected to lose 57,000 jobs after 9/11, but the BLS later said the attacks cost the economy 143,000 jobs and $2.8 bn in lost wages in the following three months.</p> <p>Could Sandy be anywhere near as bad? Most people think not. The 9/11 attacks came when the US economy was on a down swing, so it exacerbated an existing trend. Sandy, on the other hand, hit a region that was recovering. But one of the worst-off sectors since the housing boom ended has been the construction industry, and it has the spare capacity to rebuild the Sandy states at a lower cost than would have been the case five years ago. But whether that will be enough to compensate for lower activity and output elsewhere is another matter.</p>",
  "<p>Here's a sentence I wish I hadn't written \u2013 it rolled out of my Macbook in May, part of an <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\">article for Rolling Stone</a> that quickly went viral:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Say something so big finally happens (a giant hurricane swamps Manhattan, a megadrought wipes out Midwest agriculture) that even the political power of the industry is inadequate to restrain legislators, who manage to regulate carbon.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I hadn't written it because the first half gives me entirely undeserved credit for prescience: I had no idea both would, in fact, happen in the next six months. And I wish I hadn't written it because now that my bluff's been called, I'm doubting that even Sandy, the largest storm ever, will be enough to make our political class serious about climate change. </p> <p>Maybe I'm wrong, though. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the arrival of a giant wall of water in the exact middle of the financial and media capital of our home planet will be enough to get this conversation unstuck. Maybe that obscene slick of ocean spreading unnaturally into the tubes and tunnels of the greatest city on earth will shock enough people to change the debate. New York Governor <a href=\"http://statepolitics.lohudblogs.com/2012/10/30/cuomo-we-have-a-new-reality-when-it-comes-to-these-weather-patterns/\">Andrew Cuomo, at a press conference Tuesday afternoon</a>, allowed as how:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a political statement, that is a factual statement \u2026 Anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns, I think, is denying reality.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What is clear is that the storms we've experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are much more severe than before.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Truthfully, I think I'd just as soon see statements like that as carefully thought-out endorsements of climate science. It's experience that changes people: the summer's drought left more than half of American counties as federal disaster areas, and meteorologist Jeff Masters estimates Sandy hit 100 million Americans with \"extreme weather\". Add in the largest forest fires in Colorado and New Mexico, the hottest month in US history, and the completely absurd summer-in-March heatwave that kicked off our year of living sweatily, and you can begin to understand why the percentage of <a href=\"http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/hot-topics/climate-polling\">Americans worrying about global warming has spiked sharply this year</a>. Spiked high enough that even a few politicians are willing to speak out.</p> <p>Not many. The presidential candidates avoided the topic at all their big public forums \u2013 except for Romney's Republican national convention joke about how silly it was to try and slow the rise of the oceans (which probably didn't win him many votes on the Jersey Shore this week). Obama did talk climate with MTV last week, but that venue almost defines the issue's fringe status; his other real discussion of it was with Rolling Stone \u2013 global warming is, apparently, only for people with earbuds.</p> <p>They barnstormed through the hottest summer on record, and they didn't seem to notice. One appreciates cool in a president, but there's a limit.</p> <p>If Sandy, however, begins to give a little opening for discussion, we're unfortunately at the point where we have to force the discussion. After 20 years of inaction, we're so far behind the curve that we've got to raise the bar higher than mere acknowledgement that we've got a problem. We've got to get some action from these guys.</p> <p>And that, I think, requires a truly crucial set of changes. We need to neutralize the force that's kept them quiet. It's not that our politicians didn't know about climate change: I've watched, for two decades, as the world's best scientists make the annual trek to Capitol Hill to lay out the latest data. It's that, as scary as those charts and graphs were, the fossil fuel industry was scarier still.</p> <p>As the richest industry on earth, and the biggest political player, the boys from coal and oil and gas have bought one party and terrified the other. Last week \u2013 in the very final days of the US election \u2013 Chevron smacked down the single largest corporate donation in the Citizens United era, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/26/chevron-donates-2-5-million-to-gop-super-pac/\">$2.5m to a GOP Super Pac</a>. There's not a congressman who didn't notice, and who didn't think: what if they came after me with ten days to go?</p> <p>If we're going to change the political equation, we're going to do it by going after the fossil fuel industry. They deserve it. As that Rolling Stone article of mine laid out, they're planning to burn literally five times more carbon than the most conservative government on earth thinks is safe. They've turned into a rogue force.</p> <p>Which is why <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\">350.org</a> sent out an email blast today, raising money for the Red Cross and raising <a href=\"350.org\">signatures for a petition</a> to oil execs asking that they stop their campaign donations and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/30/superpacs-superstorm-sandy-disaster-relief\">spend the money repairing New York instead</a>. And it's why we launch <a href=\"math.350.org\">a road show</a> next week. We'll go to 20 cities in 20 nights, trying to spark a movement for divestment from fossil fuel stocks, and a new willingness to stand up to the industry. It starts next Wednesday in Seattle, and we'll do it no matter who wins the White House next Tuesday night.</p> <p>Because as important as elections are, they're not the biggest battle.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/\">Lebbeus Woods</a>, the cult experimental American architect, died on Tuesday in New York, aged 72.</p> <p>Born in Michigan in 1940, he worked for <a href=\"http://www.eerosaarinen.net/\">Eero Saarinen</a> in the 1960s, but became best known for his conceptual work, which explored a kind of architecture \"that gives us the opportunity to experience a type of space we haven't experienced before\", through a vast body of intricate drawings and models.</p> <p>Dynamic compositions of splintered surfaces and twisted wiry forms, his fantastical scenes depicted alternative worlds, glimpses into a parallel universe writhing beneath the earth's crust.</p> <p>His dystopian visions were often set in <a href=\"http://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/2011/12/15/war-and-architecture-three-principles/\">disaster stricken cities</a> \u2013 from Sarajevo to Zagreb, Havana to New York \u2013 and often adopted an almost medical metaphor, faceted accretions acting as \"scabs\" over the \"wounds\" of a building damaged by war and natural catastrophe. \"Architecture should be judged not only by the problems it solves,\" said Woods, \"but by the problems it creates.\"</p> <p>Beyond inspiring a whole generation of architects, he also lent his talents to Hollywood, working briefly as the conceptual architect of <a href=\"http://vincentwardfilms.com/concepts/alien-3/unrequited-visio/\">Vincent Ward's ill-fated Alien III</a> \u2013 abandoned in favour of David Fincher's much more successful <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103644/\">Alien 3</a>, which Woods later described as having \"unremarkable sets\" and \"unrelenting grimness.\"</p> <p>Woods' only built project was completed this year, the <a href=\"http://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/a-space-of-light-2/\">Light Pavilion</a> within a <a href=\"http://www.stevenholl.com/project-detail.php?type=construction&amp;id=98\">vast complex of towers in Chengdu by Steven Holl</a> \u2013 who explains more about the project below, along with a series of reflections from architects and academics, writers and critics who have been inspired by his work over the years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398677208\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351683191578/Lebbeus2.jpg\" alt=\"Detail from \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail from \"Havana, radically reconstructed\", 1994</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lebbeus Woods</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>I distinctly remember meeting Lebbeus Woods a couple of decades ago at an Architecture Forum at the Royal Academy when I was working first-time around at <a href=\"http://www.architectural-design-magazine.com/view/0/index.html\">Architectural Design</a> as one of the most junior of assistant editors for Andreas Papadakis. Lebbeus was a very charismatic man in his prime. We were publishing a monograph on his work <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lebbeus-Woods-Anarchitecture-Architecture-Architectural/dp/1854901486\">Anarchitecture: Architecture is a Political Act</a> (1992), which contains some of his most potent images. Most of the Academy staff then were under 25 and Lebbeus was as happy to chat with us, probably more so, than with the other dignitaries at the RA.<br> Looking back at Woods' drawings now contained in that monograph \u2013 projects such as the Zagreb Free Zone and Berlin Free Zone \u2013 the rawness of their dystopian vision is no less extraordinary. He seemed to both capture the visionary qualities of Deconstruction while anticipating the all-engrossing preoccupation with cybernetics. For many decades, his images and his teaching have continued to fuel the imagination and aesthetic bite of architects and students alike. He will be sadly missed, but I have no doubt that he will remain a touchstone as one of the greatest Paper Architects.<br><a href=\"http://www.architectural-design-magazine.com/view/0/index.html\"><strong>Helen Castle</strong></a><br><strong>Editor, Architectural Design</strong></p> <p>Without Lebbeus, the world of architecture will be immeasurably poorer. He was on the side of architecture rather than building, the lifelong student rather than the architect. He reminded us that to believe in the existence of architecture you need to feel it. Elaborate drawings of found spaces full of whirring sticks and lines of energy were genuine attempts to materialise the experience of space. Who else could do this? Nobody!<br><a href=\"http://www.nigelcoates.com/\"><strong>Nigel Coates</strong></a><br><strong>Architect and designer</strong></p> <p>Lebbeus was one of the last of a generation of visionaries who dedicated a life in architecture to drawing an alternative world, one important for the present and the future. His singular mind and hand will be deeply missed. <br><a href=\"http://www.eisenmanarchitects.com/\"><strong>Peter Eisenman</strong></a><br><strong>Architect and Professor of Architecture at Yale University</strong></p> <p>Lebbeus was a man of many gifts. He was an incisive, razor-sharp thinker, who sought out the flash points of political and social conflict and made them the bricks and mortar of his architecture. He was the most talented draughtsman of his generation \u2013 more than drawings, parallel universes flowed from his pencil. But his rarest gift \u2013 one that he cultivated throughout his life \u2013 was his generous, absorbent and humble mind. He didn't just teach; he never stopped learning. He was happiest with a crowd of young people around him, deep in conversation, every generational barrier cast aside: happiest not because they worshipped him as a hero, but because new worlds were unfolding in front of him. When we invited him to take part in Postopolis NYC, the first of a series of bloggers summits organized with Geoff Manaugh at Storefront gallery, he was so excited by the possibilities of the web that when he returned home he <a href=\"http://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/\">set up his own blog</a>. The conversation that began that afternoon in Storefront will continue long after the sad day of his passing.<br><a href=\"http://www.domusweb.it/en/search/author/?filtro=Joseph%20Grima\"><strong>Joseph Grima</strong></a><br><strong>Editor, Domus magazine</strong></p> <p>It's a tremendous loss.

I arrived at Leb's small loft in TriBeCa to find him standing bent over an enormous black and white drawing of a Piranese-like urban vision. His cigarette had a long grey ash that was about to drop as he greeted me briefly and turned to show me the amazing drawing.<br> Lebbeus and I began to meet every couple of weeks at a diner that served \"all-you-can-eat-for-a-dollar\" bean soup. Our ongoing philosophical discussions led to our sharing reviews in the design studios we were teaching. In 1977, I began work on a project titled Bronx Gymnasium-Bridge that would become the first issue of <a href=\"http://www.papress.com/other/pamphletarchitecture/index.html\">Pamphlet Architecture</a>. Lebbeus made the third issue with the project <a href=\"http://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/2010/06/09/einstein-tomb-30/\">Einstein's Tomb</a>. It was an amazing vision for a tomb about Albert Einstein \u2013 a strange architecture that would travel on a beam of light around the Earth. Today, I imagine that tomb is occupied by the spirit of Lebbeus.</p> <p>The freedom of spirit in architecture that Lebbeus Woods embodied carried a rare idealism. Lebbeus had very passionate beliefs and a deep philosophical commitment to architecture. His designs were politically charged fields of reality that he created.<br> In 2007, when I first received the commission to realise a 3m sq ft urban project in Chengdu, China, I began studies to shape a new public space. The building fabric would not strive for iconic objects, but rather a simple architecture sliced by sunlight shaped space. \"Buildings within buildings\" are cut into this fabric, sitting in gaps that are 8-10 storeys in the air. I invited Leb to do one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://lebbeuswoods.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/a-space-of-light-2/\">Lebbeus's Pavilion</a>, constructed of huge beams of light, can be entered at several levels. Walking on sheets of glass suspended by steel rods, the view is infinitely multiplied via the polished stainless steel lining the four-storey gap in the building it occupies. It is a brilliant and engaging architecture. An experience there, especially at night, seems to dissolve the view of the city beyond. </p> <p>This work merges art and architecture as they have merged in the past and are merging in the future. Next week, I will travel to Chengdu, walk into his Light Pavilion, stand suspended on steel rods and imagine Lebbeus's tomb has been launched \u2013 on a beam of light.<br><a href=\"http://www.stevenholl.com/\"><strong>Steven Holl</strong></a><br><strong>Architect and Professor of Architecture at Columbia University</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398677210\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351684903268/Lebbeus4.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cWar and Architecture 2-2\u201d, 1993, provoked by the war in Bosnia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cWar and Architecture 2-2\u201d, 1993, provoked by the war in Bosnia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lebbeus Woods</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many people, I was devastated to learn that Lebbeus Woods passed away two nights ago, just as the hurricane was moving out of New York City and as his very neighbourhood, Lower Manhattan, had temporarily become part of the Atlantic seabed, floodwaters pouring into nearby subway tunnels and knocking out power to nearly every building \u2013 an event seemingly predicted, or forewarned, by Lebbeus's own work.<br> I can't pretend to have been a confidant of his, let alone a colleague, but Lebbeus's influence over my own interest in architecture is impossible to exaggerate and his kindness and generosity as a friend to me here in New York City was a reassuring thing to receive. I say this, of course, while referring to someone whose New Year's toast a few years ago to a room full of friends gathered down at his loft near the Financial District was that we should all have, as he phrased it, a \"difficult New Year\". That is, we should all look forward to, even seek out or engineer, a new year filled with the kinds of challenges Lebbeus felt, rightly or not, that we deserved to face, fight, and, in all cases, overcome \u2013 the genuine and endless difficulty of pursuing our own ideas, absurd goals no one else might share or even be interested in.  This was the New Year's wish of a true friend: someone who believes in and trusts your capacity to become what you want to be, and someone who will help to engineer circumstances in which that transformation might most productively occur. If you were to walk through an architecture school today \u2013 and I don't recommend it \u2013 you'd think that the height of invention was to make your building look like a Venus flytrap, or that mathematically efficient triangular spaceframes were the answer to everything, every problem of space and habitability. But this is like someone very good at choosing fonts in Microsoft Word. It doesn't matter what you can do to the words in your document if those words don't actually say anything.  Lebbeus will be missed for his formal inventiveness: buildings on stilts, massive seawalls, rotatable buildings that look like snowflakes. Deformed coasts anti-seismically jewelled with buildings. Tombs for Einstein falling through space.  But this would be to miss the motivating absence at the heart of all those explorations, which is that we don't yet know what the world is, what the Earth is \u2013 whether or not there even is a world or an Earth or a universe at all \u2013 and architecture is one of the arts of discovering an answer to that question. Even flat-out fabricating an answer to this, meaning that architecture is more mythology than science. But there's nothing wrong with that. There is, in fact, everything right with that: it is exactly why architecture will always be more heroic than constructing buildings resistant to catastrophic rearrangements of the earth, or throwing colossal spans across canyons and mountain gorges, or turning a hostile landscape into someone's home. Architecture is about the lack of stability and how to address it. Architecture is about the void and how to cross it. Architecture is about inhospitability and how to live within it.  Lebbeus Woods would have had it no other way, and \u2013 as students, writers, poets, novelists, filmmakers, or mere thinkers \u2013 neither should we.<br><a href=\"bldgblog.blogspot.com/\"><strong>Geoff Manaugh</strong></a><br><strong>Writer and editor of BLDGBLOG</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398677211\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351685165030/Lebbeus6.jpg\" alt=\"Proposal for Einstein's Tomb, 1980\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Proposal for Einstein's Tomb, 1980</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lebbeus Woods</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Exactly four years ago Lebbeus Woods sat at my dining table in Ithaca, New York, celebrating his lecture for the <a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Oct08/AAPSymposium.html\">Architecture of Disbelief symposium</a>. It's in a state of disbelief that I write from the same spot today.</p> <p>Lebbeus generously contributed to studios and seminars at Cornell Architecture's graduate summer school in Manhattan, where he encouraged a conversation about the role of education and the state of the discipline. He inspired strong work not by enforcing methodologies, but by encouraging diverse responses to a design problem so carefully choreographed and artfully paced that students were shocked how far they came in a span of weeks. It was a pleasure and privilege to teach with him.</p> <p>My area of research focuses on scale models. When Lebbeus occasionally worked with models, they were fraught with the demands of the drawings that inspired them. Shifting from two to three dimensions was never quick or easy; it was a mystical experience. His models were dense and delicate, a nightmare for archivists and a gift to all who caught a glimpse of them. I see his recent work, the Light Pavilion done in collaboration with Christoph A Kumpusch, as a superlative model, a drawing in deep space and a fitting coda.</p> <p>In word and deed, Lebbeus reminded colleagues and students that drawing was the highest form and clearest expression of architecture. To watch his hand draft was to watch his mind at work. His lines were vectors, lines with direction and purpose, lines that danced. In an age of digitally powered representation, he powerfully communicated with ink and graphite. Yet he was never old school; no one took the future more seriously than Lebbeus Woods. Over a glass of Grey Goose and pineapple juice, Lebbeus challenged his friends time and again to stay smart, savvy and creatively supple. His humour was dark, his voice booming and his eyes always bright.<br><a href=\"http://aap.cornell.edu/arch/faculty/faculty-profile.cfm?customel_datapageid_7102=56634\"><strong>Mark Morris</strong></a><br><strong>Professor of Architecture at Cornell University</strong></p> <p>Around the end of the 1980s Lebbeus Woods was just one of a number of radical architects making their name through the production of imaginary projects; elaborate drawings and paintings occupying a milieu somewhere between fine art and architecture, which allowed many to interrogate the conventions of their discipline. Open a book on the experimental architecture of that period and Woods' heartfelt and haunting drawings regarding the siege of Sarajevo share space with early works from the likes of Daniel Libeskind and Zaha Hadid. But unlike so many of that generation who eventually made the career transition from avant-garde upstarts to global superstars, Lebbeus Woods never got rich by building rubbish. In recent years, his blog was a fascinating, unpretentious investigation into the same ideas that had driven his earlier visions: history and memory, destruction and healing.<br><a href=\"youyouidiot.blogspot.com/\"><strong>Douglas Murphy</strong></a><br><strong>Architecture critic</strong></p> <p>If, like me, you were a student of architecture in the early 1990s, you would have almost certainly possessed within your file of inspiration, along with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/italocalvino\">Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Condemned-Building-Darden/dp/0910413630\">Douglas Darden's Condemned Building</a>, a book by Lebbeus Woods. I would pore over his drawings for hours, my mind inhabiting their post-apocalyptic, post-diluvian \u2013 post-human even \u2013 spaces. They formed a storyboard for an imaginary steampunk film, very rarely depicting any human presence, giving the impression that something had happened there \u2013 possibly something terrible \u2013 and it was the readers' challenge to construct their own narrative of exactly what. This was a pre-computer rendering world of the imagination, Architecture with a capital 'A', a more serious manifestation of Archigram, challenging the world we inhabit through the power of the drawing, suggesting propositions we dare not imagine ourselves. Woods showed that all you needed to be a great architect was a sheet of cartridge paper, a set of Faber-Castells or Rotrings and a talent for imagining other worlds. The first two were easily purchased from your nearest stationer, but the last remains the preserve of the few original unique poetic talents of architecture. Woods was without doubt one of the greatest.<br><a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/EducationAndCareers/PrizesScholarshipsandBursaries/RIBAResearchTrusts/2011recipients/SteveParnell.aspx\"><strong>Steve Parnell</strong></a><br><strong>Architectural historian</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398677212\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351685270982/Lebbeus3.jpg\" alt=\"A drawing of tectonic faults from the San Francisco Bay Project, 1995\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A drawing of tectonic faults from the San Francisco Bay Project, 1995</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lebbeus Woods</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lebbeus was a larger than life character. Thoughtful curmudgeon, incredible visionary and one of the last great draughtsmen. If intrigued, Woods always made time to get involved in challenging discourse.</p> <p>He was the first well-known architect to reach out to architecture for humanity. Not only generous with his time and well thought out critique, but a quiet optimist always challenging the status quo.<br><a href=\"http://architectureforhumanity.org/\"><strong>Cameron Sinclair</strong></a><br><strong>Co-founder, Architecture for Humanity</strong></p> <p>Lebbeus Woods was a frequent visitor to the Bartlett School of Architecture in the 90s when we were recent graduates beginning our teaching careers. Not only were we lucky enough to find a seat at his packed-out lectures but we were also fortunate enough to have him crit our own work. His virtuoso drawings and exaggerated tectonic aesthetic were hugely influential. We could only dream that our architecture should embody such furious passion, where the viewer is drawn in by the intensity of line to an immersive complexity of surfaces and allusions, a leaping, gravity-defying architecture. His legacy could be seen for many years in student preoccupations with parasitic architecture, science fiction and scenographic landscapes. His architectural language continues to be re-articulated 20 years later. <br><a href=\"http://www.smoutallen.com/\"><strong>Mark Smout and Laura Allen</strong></a><br><strong>Architects and tutors at the Bartlett, UCL</strong></p> <p>I write this still reeling from the shock of Lebbeus' death, although many of us knew our friend was unlikely to be with us for much longer. I have known him over 20 years. His encouragement and enjoyment of my work has often been a much-needed balm to my own day-to-day creative struggle. Lebbeus was an architects' architect, seldom built, a huge inspiration to students and those of us who still cling to the idea that architecture can change society. He leaves us a lifetime of drawings \u2013 drawings of other worlds, worlds haunted with benevolent enigmas. He also leaves the best architects in the world memories of conversations, thoughtful prompts and happy meetings. Let us not ever deny that Lebbeus was and is one of the most talented creators and illustrators of architecture ever. He could effortlessly match the greats from other centuries such as <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/334505/Claude-Nicolas-Ledoux\">Ledoux</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bouleedesigns.com/home/index.asp\">Boulee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pira/hd_pira.htm\">Piranesi</a>. He was a virtuoso, a master.</p> <p>I first saw his work by chance in the mid-80s, a big exhibition (with a related book, Origins, still one of my cherished possessions) at the Architectural Association in Bedford Square. I was mesmerised by his depictions of a world parallel to ours, of frock-coated cybernetists experimenting with geometries \u2013 at once cosmically phenomenological and just a tad Mad Max, but never with evil intent. It changed my life. I'm happy to say I've told that to Lebbeus \u2013 in front of about 400 people and from the pulpit in the Sage Chapel at Cornell. That 2008 visit to Cornell was the last time I saw him, but we kept in touch regularly. </p> <p>During the early 90s Lebbeus was the only visionary architect to use his huge talents to try and posit a future for the war-torn cities of Eastern Europe in the throes of the Bosnian/Serbian war. He seemed drawn to areas of trauma and created architectures that turned the incredible forces of politics, nature and human creativity into architecturally benevolent opportunities \u2013 his work included proposals for Havana and the pre-1989, truncated Berlin.</p> <p>As he became older, his architecture experimented with the archetypal preoccupations of architecture, the angle, the multiple and the mediation of sky and land. </p> <p>To sum up Lebbeus's contribution to architectural discourse and his undeniable influence on my work, and that of many of my peers, in the preceding few paragraphs is crude in the extreme. Suffice to say, there will be many more thoughts on the man who lit up the imagination with images so extraordinary, so liberating and so life affirming. And it is this above anything else I will remember about Lebbeus \u2013 his life-affirming light; his belief in the power of architecture and his bluff irritation with those he felt abused it.</p> <p>Lebbeus Woods \u2013 I salute you.<br><a href=\"http://www.gre.ac.uk/schools/arc/rss-assets/news/future-cities/programme-and-abstracts/neil-spiller\"><strong>Neil Spiller</strong></a><br><strong>Professor of Architecture at the University of Greenwich</strong></p>",
  "<p>Lord Heseltine's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/heseltine-report-blasts-coalition-growth\" title=\"\">growth report</a> is a reminder that the Tories were once believers if not in big government then certainly in active, extensive government \u2013 and central government at that.</p> <p>Following such Tories as Harold Macmillan, Heseltine took the Lloyd George line: if there's a glaring economic or social problem, you invent a governmental solution, and if that involves creating a quango or squashing councils on the way, so be it.</p> <p>Just as in the 1950s Macmillan picked up a Labour policy and accelerated the creation of new town development corporations to lead his huge housing programme, so in the 1980s Heseltine created urban quangos to regenerate docklands Liverpool, the Isle of Dogs and other areas whose decline had been precipitated by the economic policies of Heseltine's party leader Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>Famously, Heseltine is one of the few senior ministers in recent times to have both understood organisations and tried to introduce substantial reform of Whitehall. You couldn't say his Minis (management information system for ministers) heralded a revolution \u2013 successive reports from the Commons public accounts committee and the National Audit Office expose the absence of the performance data Minis sought to deliver. But in both the Department of the Environment (forerunner of the Department of Communities and Local Government) and later the Ministry of Defence, Heseltine pushed administrative modernisation with verve.</p> <p>Another Heseltine creation was the Audit Commission. He had mixed motives. For all his pragmatism and statist energy, Heseltine never ceased to be a fierce political partisan and part of the commission's agenda was squeezing the spending of Labour councils. But he also gave the commission a wide remit to secure efficiency and effectiveness, which led to its becoming an agency for improving the quality of local government management, especially financial affairs.</p> <p>Clive Betts, chair of the Commons CLG committee and Margaret Hodge, chair of the PAC, have started hearings on the draft local audit bill, which abolishes the Audit Commission. I <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/draft-local-audit-bill-ad-hoc-committee/news/first-evidence-session/\" title=\"\">gave evidence on 30 October</a>, along with Robert Black, the former Auditor General for Scotland, Jessica Crowe of the Centre for Public Scrutiny and Professor David Heald of the University of Aberdeen, the public accountancy expert. Many others will as well, but already a theme is emerging.</p> <p>The commission had become \u2013 especially with Comprehensive Performance Assessment \u2013 a driver of cost minimisation and service improvement. It had started to make value for money its mission, with audit a means rather than an end. Councils broadly acknowledged and welcomed this but then started to say they could do improvement themselves, which resulted in the Improvement and Development Agency, and did not need to be bullied by a quango. This is the sentiment communities secretary Eric Pickles has sought to exploit, claiming the abolition of the commission is proof of his localism.</p> <p>But it is an open question whether councils can do self-improvement, in the absence of some central chivvying. The delays and hesitation around the <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/about-lginform\" title=\"\">Local Government Association's Inform project</a> are indicative. This is meant to be a publicly available web-based source of information about local authority service performance, something that would allow comparisons to be made fairly, between genuinely comparable areas. But after many months, Inform is still not available \u2013 partly as a result of technical difficulties in collecting and collating the data, partly because some councils fear the results.</p> <p>The Audit Commission is to all intents and purposes gone, its intellectual capital scattered. Awaiting death, it is incapable of doing much more than lightly supervising the audit contracts it awarded to private firms.</p> <p>But the Heseltine agenda remains, and the question facing the ad hoc audit bill committee of MPs is who can carry forward the efficiency and effectiveness and value for money work that the Audit Commission had made part of its brand.</p> <p><em>David Walker is contributing editor to the Guardian public leaders network</em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\"><em>public leaders network</em></a><em>, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

  "<h2>Where are we on the post-2015 development agenda?</h2> <p>In May, Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, named UK prime minister David Cameron, Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, of Indonesia, as co-chairs of <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/News/Latest-news/2012/Global-development-shaping-the-future-post-2015/\" title=\"\">a high-level panel</a> to advise him on the global development agenda after 2015, the expiry date for the millennium development goals (MDGs). That was followed by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/panel-lead-global-development-agenda-named\" title=\"\">naming of a 26-member panel</a> that will work on a report, setting out a \"bold yet practical vision\", to be submitted to Ban in May. <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/experts/kharash\" title=\"\">Homi Kharas</a>, a former World Bank economist, now at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, is the lead author of the report. The first draft is expected in March. The co-chairs and panellists are holding their first substantive meetings this week in London.</p> <h2>What is the theme of this week's meetings?</h2> <p>Household poverty is the focus this week \u2013 both defining it and looking at ways to get households out of poverty. Subsequent meetings in Liberia and Indonesia will focus on national development and global partnerships respectively, followed by a final meeting in New York in May. There will be three sessions in London. The first one takes place on Wednesday, and has been organised by No 10 and the UK's Department for International Development. It will feature several external speakers \u2013 include <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/hans_rosling.html\" title=\"\">Hans Rosling</a>, described as a data visionary \u2013 who will expose the panel to Britain's thinking and ideas.</p> <h2>What is Britain's thinking on development?</h2> <p>The prime minister has said he wants to shift the debate away from the quantity of aid given and towards what he calls the \"<a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/david-cameron-new-york-university/\" title=\"\">golden thread</a>\" of development. This involves not only aid but also stable government, lack of corruption, human rights, the rule of law and transparent information. Cameron carries clout because the UK is on course to meet the long-standing UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income on aid next year. The UK government has protected Britain's aid budget from cuts despite grumbling from within its ranks that aid should take a hit along with other sectors of government at a time of economic crisis.</p> <h2>What has been the reaction to the golden thread?</h2> <p>Development experts have welcomed the golden thread approach, but with caveats. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-barder\" title=\"\">Owen Barder</a>, Europe director of the <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/\" title=\"\">Centre for Global Development</a> thinktank, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/27/david-cameron-development-theory-convenient\" title=\"\">says the golden thread stresses free markets</a>, jobs and growth, but not other ways to encourage positive social and economic change, such as reducing inequality, tackling the power of elites, providing social protection, and ensuring a strong voice for civil society. Ivan Lewis, Labour's shadow secretary for international development, says the 0.7% target has to be accompanied by meaningful climate change targets, the removal of barriers to fair trade, fair and transparent taxes, universal human rights, social protection, free access to quality compulsory education, and health services. The panellists will meet on their own on the second day and Friday will involve \"outreach\" to NGOs and the private sector, and discussions <a href=\"http://www.worldwewant2015.org/\" title=\"\">on how to reach out to the most excluded</a>, to get their views on the post-2015 development agenda.</p> <h2>How does the high-level panel's work fit in with Rio+20?</h2> <p>The Rio+20 summit on sustainable development, held in June, agreed a plan <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/23/rio-20-earth-summit-document\" title=\"\">to set global sustainable development goals</a> that address global environmental management, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/developing-nations-fishing-protected-un\" title=\"\">protect the oceans</a>, improve food security, and promote a \"green economy\". Climate change and anti-poverty are inextricably linked. For example, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/03/eu-policy-building-resilience-disaster\" title=\"\">repeated drought in the Sahel</a> can only drive people deeper into poverty unless measures are taken to protect them from such repeated shocks. A working group is being set up following Rio+20 to work on sustainable development goals, so there are parallel tracks on a post-2015 development agenda; the trick for Ban is to combine them into one. The UN's special adviser on post-2015 development planning, Amina Mohammed, has told MPs on the development committee that both the high-level panel and the working group on sustainability <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/24/un-panel-development-goals-ambitious-timetable\" title=\"\">share one secretariat, saying the end result will be \"one development agenda\"</a>. But climate talks are making painfully slow progress, with the prospect of, at best, a weak deal in 2015 that will not come into force until 2020. \"Getting rid of poverty is about making more stuff and giving it to more people,\" said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/clairemelamed\" title=\"\">Claire Melamed</a>, head of growth and equity at the <a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Overseas Development Institute</a> thinktank. \"It's a popular thing to do, but climate change is about sharing out limited resources. Politically it's of a totally different order of magnitude and so contentious.\"</p> <h2>What about the unmet MDG goals?</h2> <p>The MDGs, which were agreed in New York in September 2000, set out eight specific \u2013 and ambitious \u2013 goals for the international community, including eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary school education, and reducing maternal and child <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2012/jun/14/race-against-time-health-mdg\" title=\"\">mortality rates</a>. Some of those goals in some countries are expected to be achieved by the 2015 deadline; others definitely will not. The World Bank says the <a href=\"http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTDECPROSPECTS/0,,contentMDK:23112468~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:476883,00.html\" title=\"\">goal of halving global poverty</a> will be met, as the population share of extremely poor people in developing countries is projected to fall from 29% in 1990 to 12% in 2015. The world has also met the target of halving the proportion of people <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/06/water-millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">without access to improved sources of water</a>, and it has achieved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/04/mdgs-girls-match-boys-primary-school-enrolment\" title=\"\">parity in primary education between girls and boys</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/13/world-target-development-goal-child-mortality\" title=\"\">But the child mortality MDG is not likely to be met</a>. The high-level panel said after its first meeting at the UN general assembly in New York in September that it plans to bring this unfinished business into the new framework.</p> <h2>What should be in the next set of goals?</h2> <p>Melamed points to the differing set of circumstances confronting this panel. The MDGs, she says, were essentially cooked up by a group of rich countries deciding how they wanted to spend their aid to help poor countries. Now most poverty is in middle-income countries, many of which are themselves donors (India, for example). <a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/idspublication/the-new-bottom-billion-and-the-mdgs-a-plan-of-action\">A 2010 report by Andy Sumner of the Institute of Development Studies</a> found that 70% of the world's poorest people live in middle-income countries, so tackling inequality is one of the most effective ways to accelerate progress towards eradicating poverty. But countries such as India can be expected to resist being told what to do within their borders. The panel sees the importance of taking on new challenges in a changed world in any framework. They include the importance of inclusive growth (a fallout of the Arab spring), conflict and gender equality. For Melamed, a good agreement on a development agenda after 2015 will be one with few issues, some numbers, and with obligations and commitments for all countries.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2012. The original said \"Save the Children says 70% of the world's poorest people live in middle-income countries\". This research was in fact done by IDS</p>",
  "<p>The UK's forests are under \"unprecedented threat\" from foreign pests and diseases, according to the government department responsible for the protection of forests and woodlands.</p> <p>The ash dieback fungus found in East Anglia last week is just the latest invader to pose a serious threat to UK trees, and government ecologists say that more than 3m larch trees as well as thousands of mature oaks and chestnuts have been felled in the past three years to prevent similar fatal plant diseases from spreading out of control.</p> <p>\"We are under an unprecedented level of threat from a range of exotic pests and diseases, a lot associated with the international trade in live plants,\" said the Forestry Commission. \"There are protections in place but the EU plant health regime is no longer fit for purpose. Too many pests and diseases are still getting through.\"</p> <p>More than 100,000 ash trees have already been felled to prevent the spread of ash dieback, or <em>Chalara fraxinea</em>, since the disease was identified in March.</p> <p>But very many more larch trees have had to be cut down in the West Country, Wales and Scotland this year to prevent a <a href=\"http://www.fera.defra.gov.uk/plants/plantHealth/pestsDiseases/phytophthora/pRamorum/\" title=\"\">plant disease caused by the <em>Phytophthora ramorum</em></a> pathogen from spreading. Known as \"sudden oak death\" in the US, it so far has not infected British oaks, but since its discovery in the wild in 2009 it has been found extensively in larch populations in south-west England, Wales and south-west Scotland, resulting in many of the trees being felled over a wide area.</p> <p>\"We now have six to eight organisms in the British Isles that are a real concern. In the 1960s and 70s it was Dutch elm disease, which killed 30m trees; in the 1990s it was a new <em>Phytophthora </em>which devastated alders along riverbanks. But in the last 10 years we have had as many new diseases as we had in the previous 40 or 50 years,\" said Joan Webber, principal pathologist at <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestresearch\" title=\"\">Forest Research</a>, the Forestry Commission's research arm.</p> <p>Plant experts are particularly concerned about the oak processionary moth, which arrived in west London in 2009 and has now developed two major populations. \"It has the potential to spread anywhere there are oak trees. It is extending its range and has become established in the Netherlands and Belgium, possibly as a result of climate change and warmer winters,\" says the Forestry Commission.</p> <p>Plant pathogens are on the rise globally and Britain is particularly susceptible because of its increasingly warm, wet winters and because it is a centre of world trade. Easy access to plants from around the world has encouraged gardeners to buy millions of exotic plants, many of which can arrive diseased. Some plants can only enter Britain with \"passports\", but the majority of diseases are only identifiable in laboratories.</p> <p>The diseases and pests can arrive by several routes, say ecologists. In March, more than 250 live larvae of the <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/HCOU-4U4J45\" title=\"\">Asian longhorn beetle</a>, which can kill oak and willows, were found in trees in Kent. More than 2,000 trees had to be felled and burned. It was thought to have entered in wooden packaging for Chinese stone.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/redbandneedleblight\" title=\"\">Dothistroma needle blight</a>, which affects a range of conifer species, threatens commercial forests by significantly reducing timber yields. It has been found in all of the commission's forest districts in England and Scotland, and three out of four forest districts in Wales.</p> <p>Tony Kirkham, head of the arboretum at Kew Gardens, which has 14,000 trees and has seen many attacked in the past few years, said some of the most serious threats came from the <a href=\"http://www.forestry.gov.uk/fr/INFD-6URJCF\" title=\"\">oak processionary moth</a>. The caterpillars can cause serious defoliation and weaken oaks to the point where they are prone to other diseases.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398651506\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/10/31/1351684184024/Ash-tree-disease-001.png\" alt=\"Ash tree disease\" width=\"460\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ash tree disease.

Having looked at the evidence, I think I'd now answer them as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 Should the UK really be stopping building onshore windfarms after those in the system are built?</p> </blockquote> <p>That depends. Assuming you accept the UK's carbon targets, it would only make sense to stop building onshore wind if: (a) we're confident that the rest of our carbon cutting plans are on track and (b) we're more worried about the visual impact of turbines than rising energy bills. Neither of these conditions currently apply in my view, though (b) in particular is a subjective matter.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 How does Decc's 13GW onshore wind target fit with the UK's overall 2020 target for renewable energy?</p> </blockquote> <p>The 13GW figure is a projection, not a target. If we exceed it, we'll cut ourselves more slack in other areas, which can't be a bad thing.</p> <blockquote> \u2022 How does the 13GW target fit with the UK's carbon targets? </blockquote> <p>Figures from the CCC suggest that we should be able to meet our carbon targets if we slightly exceed the 13GW projection \u2013 which we look set to do. That's encouraging, though whether it's enough will depend on the rest of our carbon cutting progress \u2013 and as CCC has often pointed out, it's not clear from the underlying trends that we're currently on track in most areas.</p> <blockquote> <p>\u2022 What does opting in or out of new onshore wind mean for future energy bills?</p> </blockquote> <p>It's almost certain that our energy bills are going to go up in the coming decade \u2013 both due to rising fossil fuel prices and the need to cut carbon. Of the mature low-carbon energy sources, however, onshore wind is the cheapest, which implies that the more turbines we build on land, the less we'll need to spend overall.</p> <p>That wraps up the discussion. Thanks to everyone who has been in touch with comments, contributions and suggestions.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T17:49:08.165Z\">at 5.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50915fa495cb39eabe475e9a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T17:28:05.066Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More on the energy bills question, the chart below from the Committee on Climate Change shows a breakdown of the predicted increase in energy bills between 2010 and 2020. Sorry it's so small \u2013 you can see the full version on page 17 of <a href=\"http://downloads.theccc.org.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/Household%20Energy%20Bills/CCC_Energy%20Note%20Bill_bookmarked_1.pdf\">this PDF</a>.</p> <p>In CCC predictions subsidies to all forms of renewables and carbon capture and storage technologies will add around 2p to the typical unit of power by 2020 \u2013 a bit more than the 1.5p expected increase expected from increasing wholesale energy prices, mainly driven by the rising cost of gas. Of course, either or both predictions could turn out to be overly pessimistic or optimistic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ff769350-b296-4b76-a3bd-09bbe09e4b29\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351702568505/-460.png\" alt=\"Energy bill scenarios from the CCC\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Energy bill scenarios from the Committee on Climate Change  Photograph: Committee on Climate Change</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: /Committee on Climate Change</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a financial perspective, you can read this either way: a demonstration that subsidies to wind and other green technologies are driving up bills, or proof that in a world with rising fossil fuel prices it makes sense to invest in carbon cutting now in order to avoid being overly locked into gas, coal and oil generation.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, a purely financial analysis is academic as we're also seeking to reduce carbon emissions. So unless you reject the country's carbon targets (which many do of course, especially on the Tory right), the real question is what is the least expensive way to keep the lights on while also meeting our carbon budgets.</p> <p>That too is a complex question. Economists such as <a href=\"http://www.dieterhelm.co.uk/\">Dieter Helm</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Carbon-Crunch-Getting-Climate/dp/0300186592\">have argued</a> that the correct path is simply to set a high carbon tax and see which technologies step up. But others such as <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/robert.gross\">Rob Gross</a> of Imperial College London <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/research_centre/?6263\">disagree</a>, arguing that renewables need and deserve targeted support.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-509155c295cb39eabe475e94\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T16:45:58.235Z\">4.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another point that often crops up in the onshore wind debate is the question of whether the turbines actually reduce carbon emissions as promised. Critics of wind energy argue that the results are poor because gas plants need to be kept running on \"standby\" in case the wind stops blowing. This claim was repeated today by Tory MP Chris Heaton Harris, who <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225531/Minister-signals-end-wind-farm-We-pepper-turbines-country--declares-energy-minister.html\">told the Daily Mail</a> that:</p> <blockquote> <p>[Mr Hayes\u2019s remarks are] a huge step forward. These awful turbines do nothing for the environment \u2013 they barely reduce CO2 \u2013 they force up energy bills and put more people into fuel poverty.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, this argument appears to be inconsistent with the evidence according to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/26/myth-wind-turbines-carbon-emissions\">a recent piece of analysis</a> carried out by low-carbon energy advocates Chris Goodall and Mark Lynas. Looking at real-world data on wind speeds and power generation, they found that:</p> <blockquote> <p>From analysing <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlKCs3nBXhgZdFkxYzc4VVpwQ0ZsenNocVVkTnNCUXc\">National Grid data of more than 4,000 half-hour periods over the last three months</a>, a strong correlation between windiness and a reduction in gas-fired generation becomes clear. The exchange rate is about one for one: a megawatt hour of wind typically meant the UK grid used one less megawatt hour of gas-derived electricity. This means that actual CO2 savings can be calculated from the data with a high degree of accuracy \u2013 these are not guesstimates from models, but observations of real-world data.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is shown in the graph below, which plots generation from wind and gas over three consecutive days in September.

Our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/25/climate-change-windpower\">background guide</a> from a few weeks concluded that:</p> <blockquote> <p>Onshore wind has the advantage of being one of the <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Media/Releases/2012/MR110612-review-evidence-about-onshore-wind-power.aspx\">most affordable renewable energy sources</a>. Generating electricity from onshore wind turbines typically costs around 7\u20139p per kWh, which is around half the cost of offshore wind and a quarter of the costs of solar photovoltaic panels. It is also slightly cheaper, on average, than nuclear power. Onshore wind generation is still slightly more expensive than fossil fuels (generating electricity from gas power plants currently costs between 4.1 and 7.5 p/kWh), but its price is expected to fall in the coming years.</p> </blockquote> <p>The implication is that if we're to stick with our carbon targets but have less onshore wind, then energy bills will rise. This is emphasised by two statements just in from leading UK energy experts. Professor Philip Heptonstall of the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC) and Imperial College London:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe evidence shows that onshore wind in the UK is amongst the lowest cost per unit of electricity produced from the available suite of low carbon power generation options. It follows that preventing the construction of appropriately sited onshore wind farms will make consumers\u2019 bills higher than they would otherwise be.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Professor Michael Grubb, Chair of Energy and Climate Policy at Cambridge University, agrees:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cOnshore wind turbines must be carefully and properly sited. But this intervention is nonsensical. At a time of wrenching fuel bills, serious questions need to be asked about why Junior Minister John Hayes is unilaterally advocating a policy to try and block one of our cheapest renewable energy resources and thus drive up everyone\u2019s energy bills.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T16:38:01.800Z\">at 4.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-509147efb57959e43bca9508\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T15:47:53.974Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a map <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/feb/06/wind-farm-map-mps\">we made earlier this year</a> showing wind farms across the UK at various stages of the planning process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?viz=MAP&amp;amp;q=select+col0+from+18qmes8ba-SC_2knKavaJtDwivewagUIfwKgScGI&amp;amp;h=false&amp;amp;lat=55.0334630545537&amp;amp;lng=-3.5425716162500365&amp;amp;z=6&amp;amp;t=1&amp;amp;l=col0&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;700&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Whether or not this counts as Britain being \"peppered\" with turbines, as Hayes provocatively argued, is ultimately a value judgement.

Perhaps we need more onshore wind to meet these, even if it won't necessarily be needed for the 2020 renewable energy target?</p> <p>I've asked the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) if they want to make a comment on this question and hope to hear back from them soon. In the meantime here's a graph showing the anticipated increase in onshore wind capacity in a sample energy scenario from the CCC. (You can see the whole power mix in an interactive chart on my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/14/government-gas-plan-carbon-targets\">recent blogpost on the dash-for-gas</a>.)</p> <p>This chart suggests that in CCC analysis roughly 14GW of onshore wind in 2020 is compatible with meeting the UK's carbon targets. By those terms Hayes is correct, though it's not clear that the rest of the economy is on-track to stay within its carbon budgets, in which case perhaps we'll need more wind power after all.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_104/pn11_104.aspx\">government believes the UK is on track</a> to hit its carbon targets but but interventions from the CCC over the years have suggested that many of the cuts achieved so far are not the result of climate change policies and that underlying progress isn't fast enough. For example, in their <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/reports/3rd-progress-report\">3rd Progress Report</a>, the CCC stated last year that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The pace of underlying emissions reductions achieved in 2010 would, if continued, be insufficient to meet the second and third carbon budgets. In addition, it is not clear whether this rate of progress could be sustained under current policies [\u2026] Therefore a step change in the pace of underlying emissions reductions is still required to meet the currently legislated budgets.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6f198249-a4d2-4843-b66a-1a65d1689a29\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351694467697/-392.png\" alt=\"UK onshore wind power in sample CCC scenario\" width=\"392\" height=\"235\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Installed capacity of onshore wind power in a sample scenario from the Committee on Climate Change</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: /Data from the Committee on Climate Change</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T15:01:44.885Z\">at 3.01pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5091324b95cb39eabe475e6e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T14:14:35.470Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carbonbrief\" data-user-id=\"223416400\">@carbonbrief </a>who just tweeted me to flag up <a href=\"http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/10/untangling-john-hayes-on-wind-power\">their analysis of the situation</a>, which is well worth a read.

The more onshore wind we build, the less we'll need to achieve on other fronts, such as marine, solar and biomass. And since wind power is the cheapest large-scale source of renewable power, exceeding the projection has the capacity to save the country money.</p> <p>Ed Davey made this same point in his <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/edd_onshwind/edd_onshwind.aspx\">clarification</a> earlier:</p> <blockquote> <p>There are no targets - or caps - for individual renewable technologies such as onshore wind.

How much a given level of capacity generates depends on how much the wind blows, which can vary from month to month or year to year. But the government <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/meeting_energy/renewable_ener/re_roadmap/re_roadmap.aspx\">Roadmap</a> (see page 31) estimates the the 13GW (billion watts) of onshore wind capacity it expects to see installed by 2020 will generate around 32TWh (trillion watt hours) per year.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.materials.ox.ac.uk/peoplepages/roberts.html\">Steve Roberts of Oxford University</a> has just been in touch on this subject. He writes that:</p> <blockquote> <p>Having read (rapidly!) the wind farm section of the govt report, it appears to me that it does rather muddy the distinction between installed capacity (which they give in GW) and actual output (which they give in TWhr/yr). The numbers in the report of 4GW installed wind generators giving 7TWhr/yr mean that the actual output is an average of 0.8GW - i.e. 20% of capacity actually delivered \u2013 which is pretty good given wind\u2019s variability, but still about the same as a single coal-fired power station. When it comes to \u201chow much wind power do we need to replace capacity loss over the next 5-10 years\u201d, this 5-fold difference between installed capacity (maximum if the wind blew strong all the time) and deliverable capacity (about 20% of that, maybe less given a lot of prime sites are I guess already used) has to be taken into account; and this distinction does seem to be getting lost somewhere along the way.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5091278195cb39eabe475e63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T13:28:33.525Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Gaynor Hartnell, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.r-e-a.net/\">REA</a> (Renewable Energy Association), has issued this statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>We very much welcome that Minister John Hayes recognises renewables have a crucial part to play in the future of the UK energy mix.

And that's before superstorm Sandy struck the eastern board of the US.</p> <p>Getting up close and personal to what is going on around us is something we all could do with, because without the emotional connection to what is happening in the world \u2013 it can just feel like a string of words, easy to dismiss.</p> <p>What triggered the dark feeling inside me on this occasion was speaking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/polar-arctic-greenland-ice-climate-change?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Michael Mann, the respected American climate scientist</a> whose work contributed to the 2007 Nobel peace prize, and since coming back to the UK, Hugh Montgomery, director of the UCL <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medicine/human-health-and-performance\" title=\"\">Institute for Human Health and Performance</a> at University College London. Mann told me that the speed of ice melt is so great that vulnerable low-lying island states may have to be evacuated within a decade \u2013 far quicker than anyone had imagined.</p> <p>This is disastrous, but islands such as Tuvalu in the Pacific feel distant in my mind, both physically and emotionally. The havoc in New York feels closer, as I love the city and know it well.</p> <p>What really shook me up is when Montgomery raised the spectre of people starving in this country within 20 years as climate change disrupts global food supplies. Did I hear him right? In the UK?</p> <p>I have been to Africa and seen severely malnourished children and adults for myself. But somehow in my mind that's different from thinking about it up close and personal in Sussex or Nottinghamshire.</p> <h2><strong>False cheer doesn't help</strong></h2> <p>The reason I don't want someone to come along and try to make me feel better is because I know it's important to sit in this difficult place. It's not that I want to get stuck in this feeling of helplessness and grief, but I have to go to the heart of this feeling in order to burn through it.</p> <p>I remember telling a friend contemplating suicide how wonderful he was as a person and how much he had to offer. I recognised my mistake. What he truly needed was someone who could just sit with him in that place of deep pain and hold the door open to another path.</p> <p>So how best to deal with the numerous sustainability challenges we are facing?</p> <p>False cheer does not help. Having spent time in America, there is enormous optimism on the surface and a denial of the myriad of dysfunctions lurking beneath the surface. The fact that climate change did not even deserve a mention in the presidential debates is testament to this.</p> <p>I recently interviewed Giles Fraser, the former canon of St Paul's Cathedral in London, who quit for his refusal to evict the Occupy movement. He believes one reason for our level of denial is a fear of our own mortality.</p> <p>Referring to the recent financial collapse, he said: \"There weren't enough truth tellers and actually it's the idea that somehow there is a virtue in that sort of heady optimism and you're being a misery guts \u2013 negative \u2013 by being pessimistic. The truth is a real discipline and it's actually quite difficult to face the reality.</p> <p>\"In a hundred years time we'll all be dead. They're all like 'oh don't, that's a miserable thought, that's a bit depressing.' No it's not actually. It's a fundamentally liberating thought because it's about focusing what it is for us to be humans and it's not unrelated to all the stuff about growth because it's about limit. There is such a thing as limit that makes us who we are and I think what's happened with the sort of hubris that capitalism has encouraged, is it has persuaded us that there is no limit.\"</p> <p>But how do we get the balance right to not come across as doomsayers that will just make us give up altogether?</p> <h2><strong>Finding the middle way</strong></h2> <p>The best answer I can come up with is the middle way. Face up to the truth but also have an action plan.</p> <p>As a trained executive coach, I have worked with a number of clients. Invariably the moment comes when the person I am working has a lightbulb moment. Recognising the heart of the issue they are faced with and its cause, they then turn to ask \"but what can I do about it?\" This is a fundamentally important moment. If the client cannot see a way forward, this can quickly lead to a fundamental loss of hope.</p> <p>Nic Marks, who created the <a href=\"http://www.happyplanetindex.org/\" title=\"\">Happy Planet Index at the New Economics Foundation</a>, also recognises this. He told me: \"One of the things that I would be critical of in the environmental movement is that they haven't really created a positive vision about the future. They have instead just painted the worst case scenario and talked about what the disasters are and that's very good for grabbing attention but fear is not the best motivator of people. It makes people run away.</p> <p>\"What we now see is climate change scepticism increasing as the science base increases, so what's happening is people are mentally fleeing the problem because they're frightened. It's too difficult, it's too big to deal with, so they'd rather believe it doesn't exist and that scientists have got it wrong.</p> <p>\"So I think we have to work very, very hard to have a positive vision about the future \u2013 like an approach goal. All the sports psychologists know this \u2013 you have to have approach goals to motivate people and keep going and we need to motivate business, cities, nations to move towards a sustainable future.\"</p> <h2><strong>A lesson from the medical profession</strong></h2> <p>Montgomery, who is also a professor in intensive care medicine at UCL, knows more than most about the most effective way to approach people who are facing life-threatening illnesses.</p> <p>He too believes the most important first step is to tell the truth: \"There is a message in these sorts of issues that you can't tell people bad news and I've always felt that was erroneous,\" he says. \"The idea was that you had to sell the new world that was safe from climate change, sell the positive message that came with it and I felt that was duplicitous and a bad idea.</p> <p>\"If you tell people that something isn't dangerous, that's what they hear and I don't tell my patients something isn't dangerous or they're not at risk of dying. I tell them exactly that and then I try to say let's find a way through this, let's find a way out of it. And we haven't been honest I think in telling people that this is an imminent catastrophe for them and their children and that's somehow been lost.</p> <p>Montgomery adds: \"I think we can learn a little bit from other public communications. I mean if you look at any of the big appeals there's no shying away from showing people the brutal truth but what is immediately followed up with is now you can do something, just phone this number or here's your way to engage.\"</p> <p>If only Sandy were to wake up the two American presidential candidates to the error of their ways.</p> <p><em>The full filmed interviews with Hugh Montgomery, Nic Marks and Giles Fraser will be appearing on Guardian Sustainable Business over the next few weeks </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/31/eurozone-unemployment-record-high-eurostat\" title=\"\">Unemployment in the eurozone has reached a new record high</a>. Here is what economists made of the Eurostat figures.</p> <h2>Ben May, European economist, Capital Economics</h2> <p>With surveys suggesting that firms are becoming more reluctant to hire, the eurozone unemployment rate looks set to rise further, placing more pressure on struggling households.</p> <h2>Tim Ohlenburg, senior economist, Centre for Economics and Business Research</h2> <p>Over the past week, Eurostat has delivered a string of statistics that don't bode well for the eurozone economy. Today, a reported rise in the unemployment rate to a new high of 11.6% for September is one item while another is the flash estimate of October consumer price inflation showing price pressures remaining elevated with a 2.5% year on year rise.</p> <p>The labour market continues to diverge across the currency union as a process of internal devaluation results in weak economic activity and falling wages in the periphery. In the core economies, the labour market is stable, which should ultimately lead to a narrowing of unit labour costs. Spain, now with 25.8% unemployed, is a particular source of concern. France looks much like Italy, exhibiting a steady rise in joblessness. Germany, on the other hand, is still operating near full employment.</p> <p>For the currency union as a whole, two other data points are worrisome. The latest figures for Q2 2012 show that households have been forced to reduce their savings to a euro-era low because real disposable incomes are depressed by weak income growth and significant food and energy price inflation.</p> <p>Secondly, with recession approaching eurozone governments are facing a similarly difficult time in reducing their debt burden. The debt to GDP ratio of the currency union has now reached 90.0%. Though this is driven by increases in the bailout nations, Italy, France and Spain, it illustrates a general point that it is difficult for the public and the private sectors to reduce their debt burden at the same time. Only large export gains could provide sufficient demand in this situation to keep the economy afloat, but with emerging markets slowing and both Japan and the US sliding towards their own sovereign debt crises there is no realistic prospect for that to happen.</p> <p>Financial markets have calmed somewhat, but we expect that the deteriorating economy will soon enough lead to more crisis headlines and a resurgence in bond yields. While the European Central Bank will assure liquidity, longer-term solvency is far from guaranteed. A full bailout for Spain and perhaps another for Italy are looming on the horizon.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist, IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>The modestly good news is that eurozone consumer price inflation edged down to 2.5% in October</p> <p>The very bad news is that the number of eurozone unemployed jumped by 146,000 in September taking the unemployment rate up to a dismal record high of 11.6%</p> <p>High and rising eurozone unemployment, and relatively sticky inflation, does not bode well for consumer spending across the eurozone, especially as consumers in many countries are also facing muted wage growth and tighter fiscal policy.</p> <p>With the further, appreciable rise in unemployment in September highlighting that the eurozone faces a difficult fourth quarter and beyond after almost certainly suffering further GDP contraction in the third quarter, and with the underlying inflation situation in the eurozone still looking far from alarming, we believe that the ECB will ultimately take interest rates down from 0.75% to 0.50%. We have pencilled an interest rate cut to 0.50% in December on the assumption that continuing weak economic data and surveys will gradually convince the ECB that lower interest rates are warranted. However, the ECB could delay trimming interest rates until early 2013 due to concerns that the impact of a near-term cut could be diluted by the problems in monetary policy transmission channels.</p> <h2>Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist, ETX Capital</h2> <p>That [the rise in the jobless rate] is not a surprise given the austerity measures implemented by various governments, deterioration in eurozone economic activity and struggling corporate profits across Europe. As such, investors have shrugged off the labour market data and instead amped up appetite for risk on the last day of October.</p>",
  "<p>Blackburn Rovers' standards must be slipping if Henning Berg is about to be appointed as their new manager. Nothing against the Norwegian, who won a title at Ewood as well as at Old Trafford and would probably be a good choice, but where's the comedy value?</p> <p>Consider the facts. Rovers have been talking to Ian Holloway, Harry Redknapp and Diego Maradona. There has been rumoured interest in Alan Shearer and possibly even Gareth Southgate. Does that strike you as a sensible shortlist? It seems much more likely that, like Newcastle a few years ago, the club just enjoys being in the headlines and realises that taking a risk on a slighty dotty manager that no one else is interested in employing \u2013 Holloway is an honourable exception, obviously, but he is arguably the dottiest of the lot \u2013 is a much easier way of staying high profile than getting your players to achieve something on the pitch.</p> <p>Redknapp would have had to commute from Bournemouth to Blackburn. He is 65 years old and in a 30-year managerial career has never worked farther north than White Hart Lane. There is always a first time, of course, but this would have been quite an odd time for the man who six months ago thought he was going to end up with the England job. Not only is there the possibility of a vacancy appearing in the near future at Queens Park Rangers, it would have been bizarre in the extreme to have had Redknapp at Blackburn while Sam Allardyce is working at West Ham.</p> <p>Even so, Redknapp would possibly have lasted about five minutes longer in East Lancashire than Maradona, who seems to have been brought into the picture on a whim of Shebby Singh's, leaving the rest of the Blackburn board flabbergasted. Rovers did float the idea of appointing Maradona in the immediate aftermath of Allardyce's sacking, but no business resulted and the notion was filed away with the other delusional stuff such as signing Ronaldinho and getting into the Champions League.</p> <p>Maradona does not have a great deal of managerial experience, nor of managerial success, but he would have been a huge draw for Blackburn, quite possibly a bigger coup for the club than securing the services of Kenny Dalglish back in 1991. Dalglish did have a managerial track record, however, and first-hand experience of winning the title in England.</p> <p>Maradona does not even speak English all that well (insert Dalglish joke here if desired), and all anyone knows about his colourful career in the game since he retired from playing is that he is famous for doing his own thing. Like Captain Rum in Blackadder, who insists opinion is divided on whether a crew is necessary to sail a ship - \"All the other captains say it is, I say it isn't\" - Maradona is buccaneering and unconventional.</p> <p>He would have been the complete opposite of Steve Kean, who toed the corporate line to the point where it hurt, but that would not necessarily have been a bad thing. Unfortunately you can have only so many people doing their own thing, and with \"global adviser\" Singh apparently answerable to no one within the club, owners Venky's as mysterious and remote as ever, throwing a maverick like Maradona into the mix would have created a rolling news circus that would have pushed the two Manchester clubs off the back pages. Sigh.</p> <p>Berg would appear to have more chance of winning games and getting Rovers promoted, although his managerial record is far from outstanding \u2013 he has been out of work since being sacked by Lillestrom last year \u2013 and even now the Blackburn hierarchy (ie senior figures at the club who are not Singh) prefer Holloway. The Blackpool manager would not be a bad fit at Ewood, since he is not just a shameless populist but something of a football genius, yet anyone reviewing the club's actions over the past month can see alarm lights flashing madly for any manager considering filling the vacancy, even Berg.</p> <p>If there is such an obvious split between Singh and the board, and Singh has the backing of Venky's, how is the club going to come together behind a new manager? Anyone with any sense would run a mile from Blackburn at the moment, which is presumably why Rovers have been pursuing more outlandish candidates while Bolton and Burnley have been quietly filling their vacant managerial positions with promising young managers.</p> <p>Berg has still to prove himself a promising manager, but at least he is young. And, possibly in a late bid to prove himself as wacky as the rest of Blackburn's hit list, he believes teams should be allowed to bring on a 12th man if they go four goals down in a game. No really, he does. It is an idea of the Norwegian FA's designed to prevent youth teams losing heart if they come up against greatly superior opponents.</p> <p>\"It is a good rule that will lead to more even matches,\" Berg said. \"It is no fun to lose 17-0, and no fun to win 17-0 either.\"</p> <p>Seems fair enough, as long as it is limited to junior football. Otherwise Arsenal would have been entitled to an extra man when they went 4-0 down to Reading, and that might have spoiled everyone's fun.</p>",

  "<p>Rich countries exploiting the fishing grounds of developing nations should be reined in, <a href=\"http://www.srfood.org/images/stories/pdf/officialreports/20121030_fish_en.pdf\" title=\"\">a new report by the United Nations has found</a>, in order to conserve dwindling fish stocks and improve the wellbeing of people in poor countries.</p> <p>As fish stocks around the world have become seriously depleted, the industrial fishing fleets of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/18/uk-west-africa-fishing-quotas\" title=\"\">some countries have responded by seeking out fishing grounds belonging to developing countries</a>, which often are populated by small boats rather than huge trawlers. Some governments have signed deals allowing such exploitation, while in other cases the fleet-owners circumvent regulations by registering their vessels in the developing country, while exporting the fish they catch back to their home markets.</p> <p>But this \"ocean-grabbing\" is a serious threat to fish stocks, according to Olivier De Schutter, the UN's special rapporteur on the right to food. He said the practice could damage food security and lead to the over-exploitation of dwindling fish stocks. He compared it to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/29/land-deals-africa-wild-west-fao?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"land-grabbing\"</a> \u2013 by which countries such as China and Saudi Arabia have bought up agricultural land in poorer countries such as Ethiopia and Ghana \u2013 that has been an increasing trend in recent years, and which some have blamed for endangering farmers' security.</p> <p>De Schutter said: \"Ocean-grabbing, in the shape of shady access agreements that harm small-scale fishers, unreported catch, incursions into protected waters, and the diversion of resources away from local populations, can be as serious a threat as land-grabbing. Without rapid action to claw back waters from unsustainable practices, fisheries will no longer be able to play a critical role in securing the right to food of millions.\"</p> <p>The illegal catch resulting from such practices amounts to between 10m and 28m tonnes of fish a year. De Schutter said there were also problems with fleets flouting quotas and regulations meant to conserve fisheries. As much as 7.3m tonnes \u2013 10% of global catch \u2013 is discarded every year. \"It is clear that as fish are becoming less abundant, fishing vessels are tempted to evade rules and conservation strategies,\" he said.</p> <p>EU member states have been some of the most active in negotiating rights to fish in developing countries' waters. The EU fisheries commissioner, Maria Damanaki, has vowed to reform such licensing deals as part of her plans for sweeping reforms of the EU common fisheries policy, which will include a ban on the wasteful practice of discarding edible fish at sea, in order to make quotas.</p> <p>De Schutter said more needed to be done, and called for licensing and access agreements on fisheries to be revised as a matter of urgency. One of the most important measures, he said, would be to take better account of the role of small-scale fishing fleets, which tend to serve local people rather than international markets, and which tend to be more sustainable because the fishermen take smaller catches and have less bycatch and discards. De Schutter said small-scale fishers even use less fuel per gallon than industrial trawlers.</p> <p>\"Industrial fishing in far-flung waters may seem like the economic option, but only because fleets are able to pocket major subsidies while externalising the costs of over-fishing and resource degradation. Future generations will pay the price when the oceans run dry,\" he said.</p> <p>He called for the creation of \"artisanal\" fishing zones where small-scale vessels would have the priority, and for support for co-operatives of small-scale fishermen. \"It is possible, and necessary, to turn these resources away from over-exploitation, and towards the benefit of local communities,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>You generally only get one crack at giving a talk at one of the famed TED series of global conferences. So imagine you run a global car company \u2013 what's your big-hitter topic going to be? Formula One family wagons? Hydrogen hybrids? Flying cars?</p> <p>Well, not for Bill Ford, at least. The executive chairman of US automotive giant Ford Motor Company devoted his <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_ford_a_future_beyond_traffic_gridlock.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">18 precious minutes</a> to the profoundly unsexy subject of \u2013 wait for it \u2013 congestion. Yes, congestion: that infuriating moment of being stuck behind the wheel, engines chugging, inching forward at snail's pace.</p> <p>Bill Ford's message was blunt. To paraphrase, it goes something like this: if you think traffic is bad now, just you wait. There are 800m cars on the world's roads. That could jump to 2bn, if not more, by 2050. Ahead, in short, lies \"global gridlock\".</p> <p>\"Today, the average American spends the equivalent of almost a full week, every year, stuck in traffic jams. And that's a huge waste of time and resources \u2026 When you factor in the expected population growth, it becomes very clear that the mobility model we have today, simply will not work tomorrow,\" said Bill Ford during his TED talk last year.</p> <p>Congestion isn't just a private annoyance. Chugging engines mean more carbon being pumped into the atmosphere. More hours in traffic (in 2010, a 100km tailback on one of China's national highways took more than 10 days to clear) also translates into fewer hours of productive economic activity.</p> <p>So what can be done? Congestion, in essence, can be nailed down to capacity. Our roads simply aren't capable of handling more cars. An obvious solution is to add more roads. Obvious, but insane. Insane in the Einstein sense of doing the same thing repeatedly and hoping for a different result. As Ford points out, when America began moving west, it didn't add more wagons, it built railroads. The same logic needs to be applied to global gridlock.</p> <p>\"What we need is an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimise personal mobility on a massive scale \u2026 that is the kind of system that will make the future of personal mobility sustainable,\" Ford concludes.</p> <p>Bill Ford laid out what that vision looks like when he announced the company's <a href=\"http://media.ford.com/news/billfordoutlinesblueprintformobilityvisioncallsonmobileindustrytohelpdeveloptransportationsolutions.htm\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blueprint for Mobility</a> during an address at the 2012 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona earlier this year. And Wulf-Peter Schmidt, sustainability manager for Ford in Europe, suggests there are two areas to tackle in bringing the company's vision to a reality: political and technological.</p> <p>On the public policy side, the biggest priority is to get all the key folk around the same table. Cara McLaughlin, spokesperson for the <a href=\"http://www.acea.be/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">European Automobile Manufacturers' Association</a>, says: \"We really need a concerted effort to tackle the issue of congestion. All transport modes need to have a role to play, as well as all the different players \u2013 infrastructure managers, logistics, policy makers, automotive companies, urban planners and so on.\"</p> <p>That's beginning to happen. At a European level, the <a href=\"http://www.civitas.eu/index.php?id=69\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civitas scheme</a>, which is co-funded by the EU, is pulling in city authorities from across Europe to share best practice on establishing a culture of clean mobility. The most innovative examples, such as integrated parking and travel schemes and hybrid bus priority schemes, are on show in five demonstration projects across 25 cities. The problem, McLaughlin says, is that it's mostly the \"good students\" sitting at the table.</p> <p>Although public purses are tied tight these days, money has to be found for infrastructure investment. Schmidt says cars are only \"one part of a system\". Complementarity, not competition, between transport modes has to be the way forward. An example of joined-up infrastructure is the \"Park and Ride\" concept, which allows drivers to park on the edge of town and catch a bus or train into the city centre.</p> <p>The automotive industry likes the idea of complementarity because it keeps people buying cars \u2013 albeit for use over shorter distances. Sharing is another solution that falls into the same camp. \"Look around the streets of any European city and they are absolutely lined with inactive metal,\" points out Rupert Fausset, transport expert at UK thinktank Forum for the Future. He cites the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/02/le-bluecar-car-share-scheme-paris\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Autolib</a> electric car sharing service in Paris as a sign of things to come.</p> <p>\"The average car gets used only a tiny fraction of the time. People use it for a hour to commute and then it just sits around. It's a crazy waste of resources. With car clubs, one car is parked locally and it might be used by 50 different people\", explains Fausset.</p> <p>One of the factors pushing the growth of car-sharing clubs such as ZipCar is technology. Online booking, app-enabled location devices and suchlike have made these \"smart mobility\" models not only possible, but easy.</p> <p>Take the online service <a href=\"https://www.liftshare.com/uk/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liftshare</a>, which has received a grant from the UK Technology Strategy Board, a government-funded body which promotes technology-led innovation in business. Until recently, sharing a ride to work was something arranged at the office water cooler. The internet has changed all that, with office-workers now linking up with a much wider pool of drivers.</p> <p>Another recipient of the board's support is <a href=\"http://openhighstreet.com/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open High Street</a>. Piloted in Herefordshire, the project enables shoppers to buy online from independent high-street stores. The goods are then aggregated and delivered by a single courier. Tesco Direct for small stores, if you like.</p> <p>The automotive industry is pushing the technology card hard. \"Interconnectivity\" between vehicles and infrastructure, for instance, is a boom business among software and telematics firms. Imagine as a driver having real-time data about hold-ups ahead or information on empty car-parking spaces.</p> <p>\"The ideal is to end up with a scenario where you tell your tech that you want to get from here to there, and then it outlines what's the most efficient and most sustainable way,\" says Schmidt.</p> <p>Another example of clever tech is automated driving. The technology (not to mention the law) still has some way to go before we will see automated cars on our roads, but Google has reached an advanced stage of testing and recently announced its intention to <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/25/google_automatic_cars_legal/\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">make self-driving cars available</a> within five years.</p> <p>Important as technology is, solutions to gridlock cannot only be tech-driven, says Richard Kemp-Harper, lead technologist for transport at Technology Strategy Board. \"Technology is an enabler,\" he says. \"Ultimately, we need to look at this at a systems level. Not just what's the road problem or the rail problem, but looking at how the transport system works.\"</p> <p><em>Guardian Sustainable Business have partnered with Ford to bring a range of European transport experts together to explore the future of mobility on 14 November.

He said similar budget irregularities were found after the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, in which more than 6,000 people died, but added, \"this time the funds are being used in a more deceptive way.\"</p> <p>Government officials initially defended its use of disaster funds, arguing the cash would spark a general economic recovery from which the ravaged north-east would also benefit.</p> <p>Officials said money had been granted to companies in different parts of the country because they had business relationships with smaller firms in the disaster region.</p> <p>The trade and industry minister, Yukio Edano, insisted there was \"no doubt\" the distribution of cash had benefited communities affected by the tsunami.</p> <p>Local media reported that money used to improve disaster readiness in areas untouched by the tsunami could be trimmed next year, but there is no sign yet that the government will rein in other dubious expenditures.</p> <p>Noda acknowledged, however, that the revelations had angered the public, saying he would \"wring out\" spending on unrelated projects.</p> <p>Reconstruction spending included in the budgets for 2011 and next year was supposed to help people affected by the nuclear crisis, rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the tsunami and create employment.</p> <p>The government has pledged to spend 23tn yen by the end of the decade on reconstruction and disaster prevention, 19tn of it within five years.</p>",
  "<p>When was the last time you were on your feet for five hours, in heels, and didn't notice your toes go numb? That was me, when I went to the press preview of <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-hollywood-costume/\" title=\"\">Hollywood Costume at the V&amp;A</a>. For once the word \"awesome\" is fully justified \u2013 more than 130 instantly recognisable costumes from over a century of cinema and so cleverly put together that by the time you emerge you feel as though you've just staggered out of the biggest and best Oscars party <em>ever</em>.</p> <p>I was chuffed to little mint balls to be within stroking distance of Scarlett O'Hara's green velvet gown, Holly Golightly's little black Givenchy number and Marlene Dietrich's foxy top-hat-and-tails combo. The exhibition is packed with iconic pieces of cinematic history, such as Marilyn Monroe's white chiffon dress from The Seven Year Itch, and Chaplin's Little Tramp outfit. It's not just screen stars of yesterday; modern pieces synonymous with the character they were designed for are everywhere, including Daniel Craig's Brioni-tailored dinner-jacket from Casino Royale, Will Smith's flight suit from Independence Day and Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones kit. It's a show-stopper of an exhibition and it gets even better as you walk through it.</p> <p>The flat screens in the second of the three exhibition rooms involve you in the nuts and bolts of the design process. You can stand face to face with Meryl Streep or De Niro while they explain the crucial part that costume plays in helping them to piece together the complexities of Karen Blixen or Rupert Pupkin. The screens are arranged in the centre of the room so you can eavesdrop on Martin Scorsese discussing Bill \"The Butcher\" Cutting (Gangs of New York) with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/17/sandy-powell-oscar-winning-costumes\" title=\"\">designer Sandy Powell</a>. Or Tim Burton explaining his ideas for Sweeney Todd, over a table piled high with digital sketches and wriggling cockroaches. It is, all of it, complete absorbing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398612301\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351681504586/Annie-Hall-010.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Hall\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diane Keaton and Woody Allen in Annie Hall \u2013 cinematic style inspiration.

Everyone involved in the five-year process of putting together the exhibition was at great pains to make sure we understood that. In the book that accompanies the exhibition, the difference is better explained by referring to the former as a creative art and the latter as a creative industry. That's quite a slim distinction, but I do see what they mean.</p> <p>On the other hand it seems to me that costume design has everything to do with personal style. The way in which we, as consumers of both kinds of creativity, interpret what makes its way off the catwalks and into the shops is very often influenced by what we're currently enjoying on the big screen. Personal style says a great deal about the person inside the clothes in the same way any costume designer worth their salt gets under the skin and inside the head of the character they are working on.</p> <p>Taking this a step further, I realise that when I was younger I dressed according to whatever character I had in my head at the time \u2013 there was an Annie Hall phase, the Grease episode, a few months where I was unaccountably not starring in Flashdance and more than a hint of (a diminutive) Morticia Addams here and there throughout the early 90s. I love cinema and the films I love have clearly influenced my sense of personal style far more than I realised. I think it's a shame that the sense of fun and fantasy I used to associate with fashion seems to seep slowly away with each passing birthday. It's partly the fault of the industry and the media for turning the whole business into a projection of the cult of youth \u2013 but it's also down to us to show that we can still rock it up if we feel like it. I may not ever want to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/mar/13/iris-apfel-muse-new-york\" title=\"\">dress like Iris Apfel</a> but no one can say she doesn't have a strong sense of personal style, or that she doesn't have fun with it.</p> <p>I'd quite like my personal style to include <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/exhibitions/exhibition-hollywood-costume/sponsors-statement/\" title=\"\">the Harry Winston necklace worn by Kate Hudson in How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</a> but, honestly, where's a girl to wear a yellow sapphire the size of a hen's egg?

  "<p>One has to be careful of taking the beauty in Assassin's Creed 3 for granted. This is a thought that occurred to me about 10 hours in as I piloted the franchise's newest protagonist through a sun-dappled forest glade en route to completing my latest side mission.</p> <p>Because Assassin's Creed 3 is bursting with activities, my attention to detail had shrunken somewhat. I caution against a blinkered approach \u2013 stop and take in the view sometime.</p> <p>This is because once one steps back and bothers to survey the game's environment, one can't help but be bowled over. In the brief moment I hurtled through the trees towards my destination, I gazed across a pine forest expanse, over a rock-encrusted river that spilled into a glistening lake by way of a waterfall dropping off a sheer cliff face.</p> <p>It was like something out of a Terence Malik film. And not only is the world encased in Assassin's Creed 3 an intricately presented breathtaking marvel to behold, it's age and region specific too.</p> <p>It's worth pointing all of this out because, by now, aching beauty and painstaking attention to historic detail \u2013 both visual and temporal \u2013 have become calling cards of the Assassin's Creed series. That's why they're so easy to take for granted.</p> <p>Every returning fan knows that the moment they boot up the latest entry in Ubisoft's open world epic that follows the centuries-spanning war between the Assassins and the Templars, they'll be greeted with a window into a bygone age, complete with historically accurate landscapes and characters stepping straight out of history. So it feels right to tip one's hat to the developers, given that these games now appear on an annual basis.</p> <p>The stakes for Assassin's Creed 3, though, are higher than in previous years. First off, the action leaves Renaissance Europe and heads to North America in the 1700s, dumping the rooftop playgrounds of Florence, Rome and Istanbul in favour of the wide-open American frontier and the (slightly) less wide streets of colonial Boston and New York.</p> <p>Second, the previous instalment in the franchise, Revelations, saw the end of tenure for one of the most compelling, likable and engaging protagonists in the gaming medium: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. As unfair as it may sound to start a review of a game by laying into its protagonist, Ezio is sorely missed here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398611665\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351682411688/Assassins-Creed-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Assassin's Creed 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Assassin's Creed 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His replacement, Connor Kenway, a half-Briton half-Native American with a tomahawk to grind against the British (and the Templars) replaces all of the charisma of his predecessor with a furrowed brow and not much else. In his narrative arc, during which the player controls him first as a child, then a moody adolescent and then an even moodier young man, Connor sees his village and his mother obliterated by evil British Templars, before he hooks up with the last remnants of the Order of Assassins on an estate just outside of Boston.</p> <p>He has issues, certainly, but would it have hurt to make him interesting? To say he's dull is something of an understatement; it would be more accurate to describe him as a po-faced humourless clutchplate. Long-time fans of the series will find that switching from Ezio to Connor is kind of like watching an emo garage band trying to keep an audience's attention when Queen was their opening act. The best thing you could say about him is that he's more engaging than the series' main protagonist, Desmond. Mind you, the space between this paragraph and the next is more interesting than Desmond.</p> <p>However, Connor does have two or three assets to draw players in. First off, the story in which he takes the lead is easily the best and most layered offering Ubisoft Montreal has produced to date. Here, the aims of the different factions are by no means clear-cut; the Templars are no longer carnival villains and it's questionable that the Assassins are entirely on the side of the angels.</p> <p>The American Revolution is the perfect backdrop to the plot's secret war; time and time again characters on the front lines of both conflicts blur the line between tactical expediency and moral bankruptcy. Before the release of this game, the fact that Connor seemed to spend most of his time in the trailers hacking up Brits prompted some commentators to wonder out loud if Assassin's Creed 3 was simply US hagiography. Nothing could be further from the truth (and as a side-note I'm interested to hear what Americans make of Ubisoft's portrayal of Paul Revere in the game).</p> <p>Connor's other assets are the world he inhabits and the fact that he's a veritable Swiss army knife of death dealing. Not only does he have a ton of lethal gadgets \u2013 much like his predecessors \u2013 but the developers have constructed his missions in such a way that one never feels like unimaginative rot is setting in.</p> <p>Aside from the usual shadowing of targets from rooftops followed by swift kills using a hidden blade, players will use Connor to liberate small towns, marshal squads of musket bearers, conduct cannon volleys and even take part in naval battles with enemy warships. He can even trap and skin the odd animal should the player so desire.</p> <p>Like previous iterations, Assassin's Creed 3 allows players to build up and maintain a microcosm of commerce around the protagonist's base of operations. To that end, Connor can allow trappers, loggers and a bevy of other 18th century craftsmen to set up shop on the grounds around his estate and the player is able to trade goods with them and craft items from the resources they pick up in these sales.</p> <p>There are also, naturally, a ton of collectibles in the form of almanac pages, feathers, treasure chests and pirate trinkets. Players can even stop off in the local pubs for a game of Morris if they so desire. (In the interests of full disclosure, I'm not sure how Ubisoft's alleged micro-transactions factor into all of this, as I was never prompted to pull my wallet out at any stage.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398611666\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351681981103/Assassins-Creed-3-008.jpg\" alt=\"Assassin's Creed 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Assassin's Creed 3</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Combat has received a bit of a tweak. The changes that have been made aren't radical, but it's certainly worth taking note of the tutorial for the new system \u2013 although if you've played Batman: Arkham City recently, you should be on relatively safe ground. What really prompts discussion is the new environments and how the game's signature free-running mechanics cope with them.</p> <p>The answer here is: better than you'd expect. While the roads in the American colonial cities are wider, the developers have placed trees between the streets that can't be bridged with one jump. Not only does this help finesse the player's passage between rooftops, it also happens to be historically accurate, too. The American frontier, however, takes some getting used to, but the good news is players will eventually take to it.</p> <p>Depending on how quickly one acclimatises, one may spend a half hour or so scaling trees and looking for the next hand hold. Once players realise the frontier environments are large free-running playgrounds, they'll be running along logs, kicking off boulders and leaping from tree to tree in no time. The fact that the developers have made this progression feel so intuitive is astounding.</p> <p>It's possible to lose days in Assassin's Creed 3, although if players stick doggedly to the campaign, they'll clock in about 20 hours. On top of that, there's a multiplayer \u2013 and for a game where the focus for most of the fanbase will be the single-player, this one's actually rather good. Alongside the traditional mode where players try to take out adversaries while trying to remain hidden, there's Wolf Pack Mode in which they have to co-ordinate attacks around NPCs.</p> <p>There are obviously niggles that have carried over from earlier iterations. Yes, the players have negligible agency when sprinting. Yes, the new protagonist becomes a crushing bore at the umpteenth hour. Yes, the story outside the Animus is rubbish. But the scope, ambition, beauty and flat-out bravery of Assassin's Creed3 puts it in the land of the giants.</p> <p>If you're a fan of the series, you'll be delighted. If you're a newcomer, you'll be enthralled \u2013 and good luck understanding the main narrative. The only complaint one could have is about the game's protagonist. But who knows? Maybe he won't here next year. And if he is, could the developer please have him cheer the hell up?</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Game reviewed on Xbox360</strong></p>",
  "<p>There is at least one thing about the EU that everyone seems to agree on: when it comes to political communication, Brussels is hopeless. Perhaps that particular weakness isn't currently among the union's chief worries, but it doesn't help either. So when the commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, somewhat blithely proposed a <a href=\"http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/barroso-s-budget-bid-for-2014-20-hides-increases/71520.aspx\" title=\"\">5% increase to the EU budget</a> back in June, the reaction was only too predictable: at a time when most member states are struggling to make difficult decisions on spending cuts, transferring more money to Brussels looks like a non-starter. The idea was widely rebuffed, if not ridiculed, by mainstream parties, and lapped up by populists across Europe.</p> <p>The biggest damage, however, was done to the issue itself: it invited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/29/ed-balls-eu-budget-cut\" title=\"\">politicians of all colours</a> to stage yet another disproportionate skirmish about the exact size of the budget, exacerbated by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/29/david-cameron-eu-budget-cut\" title=\"\">calls for scrapping existing rebates or granting new ones</a>. Some of this shadow boxing is excusable: politics is about money, no matter how big the pot. But it also deviates from the real challenge: the budget composition, its precise use and potential conditionality, and how exactly it can support growth, jobs and competitiveness in a difficult economic environment.</p> <p>So far, this challenge is grossly underrated in the current political debate. Although calls for \"reform\" abound, little thought is given to where and how the EU can add value by spending money, where a European budget can realise serious financial leverage, or where it can support domestic reform processes. At 1% of EU gross national income, the budget itself is rather modest: in absolute terms it is smaller than that of medium-sized countries such as Austria. Its governance mechanism therefore matters a great deal.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_the_European_Union#Expenditure\" title=\"\">Three components of the budget</a> tend to receive attention at the expense of the \"how to spend it\" question. First, there is the <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/food-farm/farm-manage/cap-reform/\" title=\"\">common agricultural policy</a> (CAP), often portrayed as France's sacred cow. With <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/faq/cost/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">nearly 40% of the EU budget</a>, it constitutes the biggest proportion and, hence, the most obvious target for critique. Most would agree on the necessity to further reduce its share but significant obstacles remain: CAP is the only policy almost entirely funded by the EU budget, so any cuts would have a direct impact on some parts of society. Also, the newer member states have so far been excluded from full CAP benefits and will only receive them after 2013. In fact, CAP has been reformed like few other policy areas over the past decade. A discussion focusing narrowly on the size will undoubtedly meet fierce resistance.</p> <p>Second, there is the cohesion fund, worth almost a third of the budget. Its laudable objective is to finance growth-enhancing projects in Europe's weakest corners. The debate has now taken the obvious turn: why should rich countries mutually support underdeveloped regions if this could also be done through national allocation of funds? Criticism seems all too legitimate given that the EU has often failed to make sure the money is handed out to the right places. But of course this is only one side of the story: structural funds do not only enable large-scale investments, they often ensure a long-term focus that national governments are simply incapable of pursuing. Looking from this perspective, the EU added value goes far beyond the question of budget size.</p> <p>Third, no EU controversy is without reference to its bureaucracy. It is no secret that most EU civil servants earn pretty well, in some cases maybe too much. But should it be an issue undermining negotiations on a new EU budget? Only 6% is allocated for Brussels' administration, competing for some of the best brains across Europe. Fraud and misuse exist, but compare extremely favourably to most national systems. Not least, annual EU budgets are fixed for a longer period, preventing unpleasant surprises. They do not run deficits either.</p> <p>On current trajectory, we are heading towards another missed opportunity in late November, when an EU summit is supposed to agree on the new multiannual financial framework for 2014 to 2020. The size of the EU's budget is not the actual problem and its reform will require more than opportunistic lip service and national point-scoring. At the very least, it will need to involve governments and opposition parties alike entering a serious debate about where Europe can add value and what kind of financial governance can best provide for it. Both dimensions are somewhat found wanting in the British debate, on the right and the left. Yet failure to do this would only underline the saying, <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger#Misattributed\" title=\"\">often attributed to Henry Kissinger</a> and paraphrased here: the politics (around the EU budget) are vicious precisely because the stakes are so small.</p>",

  "<p>It is either a clever but cynical piece of spin or an abandoning of the national interest to placate a noisy minority. It could in fact be both.</p> <p>The loquacious new energy minister <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2225531/Minister-signals-end-wind-farm-We-pepper-turbines-country--declares-energy-minister.html\">John Hayes's pledge</a> to \"protect our green and pleasant land\" by fighting against new onshore wind farms could turn out to be hot air, given that thousands of new turbines are already in the planning system. Intervening in that would be a gale-force political move generating fierce blow-back, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/31/coalition-energy-policy-row-ed-davey\">already underway from Hayes's boss, LibDem energy secretary Ed Davey</a>.</p> <p>But that is what Hayes darkly hints at and what many Conservatives want, perhaps by chopping further at the subsidies wind farms receive. If, backed by David Cameron and George Osborne, Hayes prevails then the energy minister who also claimed to be \"the peoples' minister\" will have betrayed them. Opinion polls have shown time after time that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/wind-shale-gas-icm-poll\">public overwhelmingly supports wind power</a>, even when close to their homes. They understand that the real threat to our green and pleasant land comes from climate change and the ever weirder weather it brings: the floods that devastated middle England in 2000 were made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/feb/16/climate-change-risk-uk-floods\">three times more likely by global warming</a>.</p> <p>Hayes has also betrayed energy bill payers at a time when bills are soaring so high that the Prime minister <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan\">felt forced to invent new policy</a> on the hoof. Here are the facts. Clean energy is not optional, either because of legally binding carbon targets or practical energy security concerns, and onshore wind is the cheapest form of low-carbon energy. It <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2012/feb/29/electricity-generating-costs?intcmp=239\">costs about the same as gas</a> \u2013 without the greenhouse gases. Rejecting onshore wind farms means pushing up homeowners' energy bills because that lost energy must be replaced by more expensive alternatives, such as offshore wind farms that cost not far off double. This is not, as Hayes stupidly describes it, \"a bourgeois left article of faith based on some academic perspective.\"</p> <p>However Hayes does raise one important and real problem: \"We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities.\" The one genuine objection to wind farms is that you don't like the look of them. But people faced with turbines built by vast, faceless energy companies who import the hardware to their backyard and then export all the benefits <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/mar/01/local-opposition-onshore-windfarms-tripled\">understandably feel invaded</a>. When the turbines are community owned, or local people at least benefit, that sense of violation vanishes. The wind farm at Fintry in Scotland demonstrates this, as does <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/may/30/germany-renewable-energy-revolution\">Germany, where over 60% of renewable energy</a> is community owned and opposition to wind farms barely exists. In the UK, community ownership is well under 10%.</p> <p>A consultation on wind power now under way gives Hayes two edges to the sword he is waving at the turbines. First, it will examine how to correct two decades of failure to promote community ownership. This is where the real solution to the wind war lies. But second, it will examine \u2013 yet again \u2013 whether the subsidies all new technologies need to break the grip of incumbents could be cut further for wind power. Subsidies do indeed taper down over time \u2013 unless they are for nuclear power \u2013 but there is clear evidence that further cuts now would be needlessly damaging. </p> <p>That evidence already forced Cameron and Osborne to back down from a earlier <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/jun/02/george-osborne-cuts-windfarm-subsidies\">attempt to slash wind subsidies</a> this summer. So Hayes appears to have been tasked with finding different evidence. He certainly appears to be able to hold two conflicting thoughts in his head at the same time. Yesterday, as he threw the future of wind farms into doubt, he was also telling a renewables industry conference that he recognised the \"need for sufficient certainty to invest in the future.\"</p> <p>In the end it will come down to a battle within the coalition to choose between two polls. Will it act on the wishes of the whole British people, repeatedly expressed in opinion polls. Or will the poll that is prioritised be the general election ballot box in those Conservative marginal seats where an ill wind blows?</p>",
  "<p>Whilst the ever ubiquitous tablets, smart phones and connected TVs provide continued variety and choice for audiences on how and when they consume content; this fragmentation across platforms is a challenge for publishers, advertisers and rights holders. From trying to reach target audiences, planning and optimising campaigns across multiple platforms, to creating engaging content appropriate for multiple devices, the way we consume media is changing. Charlie Muirhead, the man behind Rightster explains how the questions this new, fragmented landscape raise, are exactly the ones Rightster are looking to answer.</p> <h2>What is Rightster?</h2> <p>Rightster brings together incredible capabilities in one place \u2014 enabling us to provide integrated, content-led solutions to brands \u2014 from co creating original programming with Rightster studios, to accessing a network of publishers and content producers and offering real insight and learnings on the impact of campaigns with our audience insight tools. It's very powerful to be able to support brands and clients from the inception and creation of the idea, to the post-campaign reconciliation and reporting explains Charlie, adding that in addition for advertisers Rightster offers a simple way of buying precisely targeted pre-roll in front of a large audience by demographic, content type, or time of day.</p> <h2>How is media consumption evolving as we live this digital lifestyle?</h2> <p>The arrival of the tablet has been an hugely disruptive force \u2014 it is incredible to think that only a few years ago, people were questioning whether the format and device would work at all. Now, we have a situation where there are increasingly more and more rights available online, and consumers have even more choice over the content they consume, and on which device.\" Through it's unique combination of software and services, Rightster works to help brands, publishers and content owners navigate the complexity and deliver their content and campaigns to the right audiences.</p> <h2>What are the emerging media trends that excite you right now?</h2> <p>Social has changed the way that we share experiences. I think social television and social apps that understand you and can automatically recommend content and relationships that you didn't necessarily have before are thrilling. Rightster also has particular expertise in the facilitation, monetisation and distribution of live content \u2014 having streamed everything from London Fashion Week to the Leveson Inquiry and the Royal Wedding, we do a lot of work in the live space, and it's a remarkable trend. It gives publishers, portals and blogs access to the world's most exciting content, from a football match to a reading of the Budget. Our prediction is that we're going to see the volume of live streams increase on more platforms, but that we'll also see them customised and editorialised to suit those platforms.</p> <h2>What is next in online video?</h2> <p>Online video has gone through many different evolutions already \u2013 I think the trend we see is firstly the quality of the videos going up and up.\" Gone are the days of grainy, buffering videos \"Not long ago, Rightster streamed the Glyndebourne Opera in HD, and the comments we received from all over the world were overwhelmingly positive. People just wanted to share with the Rightster team how amazing it was to sit in their front room with their dressing gowns, slippers and a glass of wine and to experience the opera in HD. Wonderful.</p> <p>Muirhead also predicts the acceleration of Connected TVs 'although they're available, the adoption rate is still very low. Very soon however, I believe we'll see a very big change in how many people want to go direct to a fashion event, or a football league match etc, from the comfort of their living rooms.</p> <p>\"And then last but not least, I think we're going to see a lot innovation around new payment options. Today you have ad-funded content and you have online skippable ads \u2014 but in TV the concept of a skippable ad doesn't really exist. People just skip ads by fast forwarding through them. So I think the monetization models, the option to skip an ad, will change.\" He adds that \"to be able to pay to have no ads is another option that is going to take hold and I am sure there's going to be a lot more subscription models in the digital space doing what Spotify has done for music. I would expect more things like that to appear for online video.</p> <h2>Show me the money </h2> <p>What's your take on the question of mobile and the challenge this presents to advertisers? \"Getting pre roll video advertising on to mobile devices was crucial and now it has become a reality. But where we are going next in terms of location sensitive technology is amazing. Walking down the street and being able to get a much targeted experience of a local promotion from the shop you might be walking by is just an example of what comes next.</p> <p>But in order for mobile to bring revenue for brands and advertisers alike, it's going to be absolutely critical to find the right monetisation models and I think that we're just started working to that direction.</p> <h2>Can we expect all digital and physical media to be biddable and addressable in years to come?</h2> <p>The question of real time bidding and biddable inventory is an interesting one. We see a great interest in advertisers wanting to appear against premium content wherever it will sit. We also see a lot of interest in people being able to bid for an audience's time. We have worked to make sure that all those models can coexist on the same platform.</p> <p>The owned, the earned and the paid. Rightster works in several different ways with its clients \u2014 when you look at the Rightster network and Rightster Studios, there is this one area which is dedicated to owned media. Our services help rights holders to manage their video content whether it's for their own website, YouTube channel, Facebook page or Twitter account. All of those are what we call 'owned media' \u2014 where the rights holders are in control.</p> <p>The second area we deal with is in earned media. We offer an extensive network of publisher relationships, where we can take the video content and distribute it out to the publisher. Add to that a pre-roll ad we're running in front of that content typically enabling a revenue share to be achieved between the publisher and the rights holder.</p> <p>Last but not least, in terms of paid media, over last 3 months we've adapted the Rightster network to be able to support this business model as well. Simply put, paid media can guarantee to content producers that their video is on a certain site and has a certain number of views.</p> <h2>Highlights of 2012?</h2> <p>This has been an amazing year for Rightster, working with huge news organisations like ITN Productions, Sports News Television (SNTV) and the Guardian, sport rights owners like MP &amp; Silva, and even the world of world of viral content as we join forces with Viral Spiral to create original programming around some of the internet's best loved videos. We've also distributed the live streams from Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York for the first time to a network of publishers, and worked with London Fashion Week for the seventh season distributing their catwalk content.</p> <h2>What's next for Rightster?</h2> <p>The three things on Rightster's agenda for the next 12 months are: to expand globally, to grow our partnership program and, of course, to innovate more. We're already operating worldwide but by the end of this year we aim to have offices in 15 cities. What we really want is to take our turnkey solutions globally. At the same time we need to build more relationships with publishers, platforms, technology partners and different advertising partners. And while we're doing this, we'll keep innovating. Our software team is creating some very clever bits of technology and algorithms to optimize tools like Audience Development on You Tube, Search Engine Optimization and building private syndication portals. By making these available to our clients, we give them their own branded environment from which their publisher partners can come and pick up content.</p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Katy B, the Kooks and James Blake may sound pretty different, but they do have one thing in common: they all studied modern music at university.</p> <p>Despite the widely held assumption that rockers are a bunch of sporadically inspired layabouts and pop stars are pre-packaged dancing queens, a surprising number of musicians on the world stage found fame by keeping their heads down, studying hard and listening to their tutors.</p> <p>But what exactly do you learn if you do a degree in modern music?</p> <p>Students find out a lot about a rapidly changing music industry, learn about the history of contemporary music styles, and develop a head for business, crucial if you don't want to make your money busking in a station at midnight.</p> <p>\"They're very competitive courses,\" says Kelly Wood, live performance official at the Musicians Union. \"They're adapting to the needs of the industry. Degrees are focusing more on the business side than the creative side, and help people understand the supporting roles.\"</p> <p>Wood encourages young musicians to think carefully before signing up: \"Suitable students need to be interested in the workings of the industry. If all they're interested in is releasing their own albums, maybe a degree isn't right for them. The cost is high, so you should weigh it up.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bimm.co.uk/brighton/tutors/jake-shillingford\" title=\"\">Jake Shillingford</a>, head of Music Business at the <a href=\"http://www.bimm.co.uk/brighton\" title=\"\">Brighton Institute of Modern Music</a> (Bimm), and one-time frontman of Britpop band My Life Story, says the school insists tutors have had successful careers themselves.</p> <p>\"It's essential that tutors have an ongoing real-world experience that they can bring into the classroom,\" he says.</p> <p>Bimm, founded in 2001 by a group of industry stalwarts, already boasts a host of successful alumni. Ben Thompson, drummer for the chart-topping indie band <a href=\"http://twodoorcinemaclub.com/\" title=\"\">Two Door Cinema Club</a>, is a recent example. He took a professional diploma in musical performance at Bimm in 2010, but ended up finishing his course on tour after getting an audition for the band through the college's networks.</p> <p>Since then, he says, he has played \"nearly every big TV show, festival and venue in the entire world. There isn't much more any musician can ask than that.\"</p> <p>Fellow Bimm alumnus Charlie McClean did a BA in professional musicianship and got a job as an assistant recording engineer soon after graduating: \"Yesterday I was in the studio playing cello for the new One Direction single, and I've done some work on the new Susan Boyle record too. I remember sitting there thinking how did I get here? It's just incredible.\"</p> <p>Sarah Kerton, who completed a popular music and recording BA at the University of Salford, says her degree has been \"the force behind my achievements both musically and academically\".</p> <p>She went on to study a masters and is a published academic, but she is still in an all-grrrl punk band called <a href=\"http://awesomewells.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Awesome Wells</a>, which plays throughout Europe.</p> <p>\"Vocational degrees such as mine come with a wealth of contacts, opportunities and chances to really chase your dreams, and every young person should be able to do that,\" she says.</p> <p>The University of Chichester also runs successful commercial music and music business degrees. Head of music Ben Hall is proud of the diversity generated by having <a href=\"http://www.chi.ac.uk/department-music\" title=\"\">modern music courses</a>.</p> <p>His department has the highest proportion of students from lower income groups at the university and he says that's because they do rock and pop \u2013 styles that feel accessible to musicians who haven't received costly one-to-one tuition. Everyone who applies is auditioned \u2013 which means students just need to demonstrate raw talent to get a place.</p> <p>\"We have rockers, beatboxers\u2026 even if death metal is your thing then we'll welcome you with open arms,\" Hall says. \"What all the musicians have in common is that they are bloody determined to be musicians \u2013 this is as true of a rock drummer as it is a trombonist.\"</p> <p>The modern music courses at Chichester are also geared up to help students make a living from their trade. \"All our commercial music students learn how to give lessons in their style,\" says Hall. \"So if you're a funk saxophonist, you'll learn how to teach an eight-year-old. You'll always be able to make a living.\"</p> <p>One young musician hoping her guitar BA will lead to a successful career is Soph Nathan, who plays in the band <a href=\"http://hellabetterdancer.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Hella Better Dancer</a> and has just begun her first term at Bimm: \"Studying a music degree gives me the opportunity to learn about lots of different styles of music and how to play them. That could help me a lot in the future if I go on to do session work.\"</p> <p>As for the \"rock 'n' roll\" atmosphere at the college, Nathan says: \"It's great to be in an environment where everyone around you has the same passion. I've felt excited after learning things in most of my lessons so far, so that's a good sign.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Don't miss a live Q&amp;A with industry experts about earning a living through music, on the Guardian Careers site on 8 November from 1-3pm.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 Oct 2012.

  "<p>Buying a Porsche is a thrill, says World Business Council for Sustainable Development president Peter Bakker, but it's not a patch on buying your first 747 \u2013 something he did while chief executive of logistics company TNT.</p> <p>The problem with 747s, though, is their humongous carbon footprint, something Bakker now admits. He was speaking at an internal workshop Volans co-hosted for Nestl\u00e9 late in October 2012 at the food giant's Vevey headquarters in Switzerland \u2013 and his self-declared aim was to turn his audience into market revolutionaries.</p> <p>The WBCSD published its ambitious <a href=\"http://www.wbcsd.org/vision2050.aspx\" title=\"\">Vision 2050 study</a> a few years back and recognising the importance of this 'stretch' concept, coupled with the difficulties of taking it into the mainstream, one of Bakker's first acts on taking over the organisation was to start working on an updated and enhanced version.</p> <p>The goal is clear: nine-plus billion people by mid-century all living well, within planetary boundaries. But short-term pressures, aggravated by the financial downturn, have conspired to stall progress at every point along the road. To turn up the heat, Bakker decided to stress-test the Vision 2050 trajectories against the nine planetary boundaries \u2013 within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.stockholmresilience.org/planetary-boundaries\" title=\"\">identified by the Stockholm Resilience Centre</a>.</p> <p>The world, Bakker warned, is \"on fire\" \u2013 and the lack of real progress to date \"scary\". So far, he says, it has been more a matter of nice words than real action. He noted that the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts that the additional coal-fired power plants due for construction by 2017 will lock us into an inconceivable five-degree warming trajectory.</p> <p>On current evidence, governments aren't going to sort this out for us any time soon, though this is not to say that at least some of them do not recognise the importance of the challenge. But the lesson is clear: \"Business is now the only force with the ability to crack this.\" That said, business must find ways to work with governments to tackle the issues, a key area WBCSD focuses on. And business must act now, developing solutions at scale and \u2013 above all \u2013 work on changing the rules of the market game.</p> <p>Instead of trying to work with all countries at the same time, WBCSD plans to prioritise initiatives with leading edge countries and cities in particular.</p> <p>Bakker, also a self-described \"blunt Dutch capitalist\", says he suffers from a handicap when it comes to diplomacy: describing reality as he sees it, even if he risks upsetting many of his colleagues in the global C-suite. And one thing he said which may have unsettled some at Nestl\u00e9 was that he \"doesn't believe in win-win solutions\" as the answer to the systemic challenges we now face, which some might see as akin to cursing in church, given that Nestl\u00e9 was the fountainhead of the increasingly successful <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2011/01/the-big-idea-creating-shared-value\" title=\"\">shared value movement</a> spearheaded by Michael Porter and Mark Kramer.</p> <p><strong>The concept of stretch: a call for both shared value and sustainability</strong></p> <p>Kramer was also invited to do a video presentation for the Nestl\u00e9 workshop. In it he accepted that although shared value is a powerful way to frame business strategy challenges, and while there is a growing spectrum of tools to help business leaders achieve win-win solutions, the aim has never been to address systemic challenges like climate change with the urgency described by Bakker.</p> <p>Rather than allowing territorial squabbles between the shared value and sustainability communities to slow progress, workshop participants concluded that the way forward must be to create a hybrid of the best of both worlds. Kicking off the session, I offered my own take: that shared value needs to be stretched by the sustainability agenda and that sustainability, where at risk of being watered down as it progresses into the mainstream, must be stretched with the sort of zero-based targets (among them zero waste and zero net energy buildings). These targets already feature in the later decades of the WBCSD Vision 2050 roadmap.</p> <p>When I originally suggested a zero workshop to Nestl\u00e9, around the time we launched my book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zeronauts-Breaking-Sustainability-Barrier/dp/1849713979\" title=\"\">The Zeronauts: Breaking the Sustainability Barrier</a>, I confess I worried that this would be several bridges too far for the world's largest food company. Instead, I discovered that their chief operating officer, Jos\u00e9 Lopez, had spent years working in Japan, and had emerged totally persuaded by the \"power of zero\" \u2013 which sits at the heart of Japanese approaches to total quality and lean production. Indeed, he promptly offered to co-host the first zero workshop.</p> <p><strong>Zero-based approaches</strong></p> <p>The session proved to be quite an eye-opener, with Lopez's Nestl\u00e9 colleagues presenting a series of 'towards zero', 'net zero', 'zero or beyond zero' targeted projects and programmes from across the company. <a href=\"http://www.nestle.co.uk/media/pressreleases/Pages/NestleZeroingInOnSustainabilityTargets.aspx\" title=\"\">The company's York factory, for example, home to KitKat, has achieved zero waste</a>. Then there was the 'excellence diamond' approach, which is now used in some parts of the business and is shaped with five facets including injuries, cost and waste \u2013 each clearly linked with zero targets. Intriguingly, this approach was inspired by the airlines, which have very successfully targeted zero accidents across their flight lanes. Piloted in a number of plants, the diamond approach is now being rolled out to all 400-plus Nestl\u00e9 sites.</p> <p>Another approach used by Nestl\u00e9 is the ZerEau initiative, designed to wean milk factories off water completely by exploiting the water contained in the raw milk delivered to the Nestl\u00e9 sites. \"Why the hell do we need water in a milk factory? 88% of milk is water,\" the lead engineer had wondered after his Eureka! moment. Now the aim is to achieve a positive water impact, not simply to reduce groundwater demand to zero.</p> <p>After the session, Lopez spoke of the need to \"intend the unintended consequences\" of what businesses do, and there's no question that as companies like Nestl\u00e9 go after shared value they will need to keep their longer term vision closely focused on the stretch sustainability concept. But I also came away with a sneaking suspicion that companies that get this shared-value-sustainability-zero blending right will stumble on all sorts of un-imagined positive consequences.</p> <p><em>John Elkington is executive chair of </em><a href=\"http://www.volans.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Volans</em></a><em> and a non-executive director at </em><a href=\"http://www.sustainability.com/\" title=\"\"><em>SustainAbility</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Next nudged its profit forecast for this year higher after stronger sales in recent weeks, adding to optimism that the UK retail sector is bouncing back from a weak summer.</p> <p>Britain's second-biggest clothing retailer said stronger sales in late September and early October made up for an unusually quiet start to August. Next sales rose by a better-than-expected 2.7% in the 13 weeks to 27 October, its third quarter, with its shops 1.1% ahead. Directory (online and catalogue) sales climbed 5.6%, a sharp slowdown from 13.3% in the first half, suggesting that the benefit from improved delivery options is fading. The 2.7% figure compares with sales growth of 4.5% in the first half.</p> <p>Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche said: \"Bears will point to the slowdown in Directory sales and bulls to the impressive pickup in retail sales. We are big fans of this blue blood multichannel retailer.\"</p> <p>Analysts said it was a \"quarter of two halves,\" with sales down in August as many people stayed at home to watch the London Olympics. But improving confidence and colder weather prompting shoppers to buy knitwear and warmer jackets led to sales bouncing back in the autumn. Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said: \"This 10% swing in sales growth through the quarter correlates with good recent sales data from BDO, John Lewis and Debenhams and bodes well for other retailers yet to report, such as M&amp;S.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/30/uk-retailers-sales-growth-cbi\" title=\"\">A CBI survey showed on Monday</a> that shoppers spent far more on the high street than expected this month as inflation eased, adding to other evidence that the economy is recovering from recession. This has boosted retailers' confidence ahead of the key Christmas period.</p> <p>The Next Directory business, new store openings and a move into homewares and overseas markets have helped Next buck the gloom at home. Other retailers have found it tough to keep going at a time of squeezed incomes, job fears and government austerity measures, which have led to belt-tightening among consumers.</p> <p>The company, which has more than 500 stores in the UK and Ireland and almost 200 shops abroad, said sales remain volatile, but narrowed its full-year sales growth forecast to between 3% and 4.5%. The narrower range and greater certainty on costs for the rest of the year enabled it to raise its pre-tax profit forecast slightly to \u00a3590m-\u00a3620m, from \u00a3575m-\u00a3620m.</p> <p>James McGregor, director of the retail consultants Retail Remedy, said: \"Next has set itself a very high bar \u2013 for a fashion retailer to deliver an annual profit of \u00a3600m in the current environment is truly impressive. The company has no magic formula, just a tried and tested multiplatform approach. It perfected its holy trinity of online, directory and physical stores long before its rivals had even begun to look beyond physical stores. It understands its customers well, listens to them and reacts to their needs. The result is a loyal and trusting customer base.\"</p>",

Some 330 buses will deliver the connecting service. A few Metro North and Long Island Railroad services will start today.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Kennedy and Newark Liberty airports reopened with limited service Wednesday morning.</strong> New York's LaGuardia Airport, which suffered far worse damage and where water covered parts of runways, remained closed.

It reads: \u201cMultiple National Guard trucks will be coming through flooded streets, first to evacuate those with true medical emergencies. Keep an eye out, go down to the lowest possible floor, but do not go outside. Signal to get their attention.\u201d</p> <p>More than 20,000 people are trapped in their homes, according to reports, without power for the third day running as many parts of the city remain under several feet of water. Residents are being urged to stay inside for safety reasons as the water has live wires and is contaminated with sewage. More than half the population of 50,000, are without power, according to <a href=\"http://www.hobokenhorse.com/\">a city website</a>.&#xa0;Water is not expected to recede for 24-48 hours.</p> <p>The mayor sent out a call on Twitter asking for local volunteers to report to City Hall at 10am on Wednesday. Two shelters have been set up on Hudson Street, and people are being asked for blankets, pillows and other items to help make the evacuated more comfortable.</p> <p>Hoboken's Facebook page has become a message board for residents and their relatives, desperate for contact with each other as well as for information.

Virgin protested, and said it would take the government to court, the government held firm, and then when McLoughlin took over from Justine Greening as transport secretary in September the whole process was scrapped. McLoughlin laid the blame \"fairly and squarely\" on DfT officials, suspending three of them.</p> <p>McLoughlin is also expected to be asked why he told MPs when he appeared before the committee in September that he was happy with the bidding process, and then scrapped it a few weeks later.</p> <p>On Monday the transport secretary published the initial findings of the report he set up to look into the whole affair, led by Sam Laidlaw. It said the DfT had been \"aware of a lack of transparency\" in an aspect of the franchise process but had decided to continue \"and to accept the risk of a bidder challenge\", the Press Association reports.</p> <p>The Laidlaw report also said the companies bidding for the franchise were not provided with adequate information, the DfT did not follow its own guidance, and the evaluation of the financial robustness of the bids was \"developed late, in a hurry and without proper planning and preparation\".</p> <p>Laidlaw said the DfT had undergone staff reductions and frequent changes of leadership, and organisational changes and the department's structure \"resulted in a lack of clarity around allocation of responsibility\" for the bidding competition. These factors raised \"potentially significant issues about the ability of the DfT effectively to conduct rail franchise competitions\".</p> <p>The government is now in discussions with Virgin about its continuing to run services for up to 14 months until an interim franchise competition is held before a competition for a full franchise.</p> <p>The route is the busiest in the country and runs from London through Birmingham and Manchester to Edinburgh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-90011906-284d-4b81-9b8c-f4f0323fc874\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351691652148/a32e2bbf-a85a-4b29-b7b5-31d1c7cf0682-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A Virgin train passing a First Group train on the west coast mainline.

But we\u2019ve consistently targeted a real terms freeze in the next multi-year EU budget (Multiannual Financial Framework/MFF) because that\u2019s the best deal we can actually deliver for British taxpayers.</p> <p>We can veto this \u2013 and we will if we don\u2019t get a real terms freeze: no deal is better than a bad deal \u2013 but the veto won\u2019t leave us in the best place. If there\u2019s no agreement then ultimately we move to annual budgets, decided by qualified majority voting and jointly with the European Parliament.

But does anyone really believe this is not, as David Cameron said, simply \"rank opportunism\" from Labour, who as a rule have been pro-EU for decades? Miliband's position makes for great tactics - this afternoon's vote will certainly put the government in a difficult position - but as genuine practical policy it's unconvincing.</p> <p>However, Miliband did come out with a new attack line which may get some traction: \"He is weak at home, he is weak abroad - it's John Major all over again.\"</p> <p>Miliband was also on stronger ground regarding Lord Heseltine's growth report, which attacks much government policy. After Miliband read out a Heseltine quote implying that the government had no strategy for growth or wealth creation, Cameron's reply that actually the former DPM thought the coalition was roughly on the right track was almost satirical. And the Davey/Hayes wind farms row meant it was a great day for Miliband to be able to quote Heseltine's specific point about the government not having a coherent energy policy. Cameron had no real answer to that, and looked evasive. </p> <p><strong>Verdict: a draw.</strong></p> <p>PS John Bercow, the Speaker, proved yet again how much of a stickler for the rules he was by telling the PM and other MPs off for breaches of parliamentary etiquette.

Section 3.30 refers to the Govt Chief Whip being responsible for the arrangement of business but gives neither that individual or the Leader of the House any additional power or authority to order business.</p> <p>Business is arranged by agreement through 'Usual Channels' (Govt/Opposition discussions). Changes are either by agreement or on motions to the House. So maybe Strathclyde can't just unilaterally pull stumps on the bill.</p> </blockquote> <p>The background to this is the Lib Dem decision to block the boundary changes - which would favour the Tories - after the Conservatives blocked Lords reform. The Tories are said to accept the boundary changes will now be delayed until 2015, but they are surprised Lib Dems are backing a delay until 2018. Waugh writes: \"I understand the DPM's position is that he meant what he said when he said he would block the boundary changes in retaliation for losing Lords reform.\"</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5090ed4395cb49410b863b96\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T09:20:03.641Z\">9.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wind farms</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sir Bernard Ingham, Margaret Thatcher's former press secretary, now secretary of the pressure group Supporters of Nuclear Energy, has commented on John Hayes's anti-wind farm remarks, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Reality is dawning.

  "<p><strong>What does your role leading large scale change in healthcare involve?</strong></p> <p>I act as a thought leader, identifying, developing and testing new ideas and practices about change for the NHS and helping to adapt them. Many of the previous, incremental ways of undertaking change aren't fast enough or broad enough for the future. I've been leading practical strategies to test and implement large-scale change at a national level in the NHS for more than a decade. My role is also about making connections and building knowledge networks across the NHS and the globe.</p> <p><strong>What's your professional background?</strong></p> <p>I joined the NHS in 1991 as part of a scheme to bring senior leaders from other industries into the health sector, but my first degree was in social science. In my 20s, I worked in organisational and leadership roles in local government and education. My roles were always about leading change, helping people think differently and building new skills. I set up one of the earliest total quality management projects in education in the late 1980s.</p> <p><strong>You are very active on Twitter \u2013 how important is social media?</strong></p> <p>Social media provides a phenomenal gateway to networks and connections and enables us to build communities with people with the same interests and challenges from across the globe. In a one-hour scheduled Twitter discussion, we can make 250,000 \"impressions\". I can pick up the latest trends and opinions instantly, and we are making increasingly good use of other virtual communication systems, such as online webinars. Social media has no regard for hierarchy. It is such a powerful enabler for the healthcare improvement movement and we need to ride the wave.</p> <p><strong>What would transform the public sector's reputation for a lack of innovation?</strong></p> <p>The gap between the potential and reality of innovation is a significant issue. That's why the national NHS strategy Innovation, Health and Wealth is so important. The NHS has the most unbelievably creative workforce, which has produced some of the biggest global breakthroughs in clinical science and service delivery methods. It's about how to unleash that across the whole system.</p> <p><strong>What have you learnt about managing large-scale NHS change?</strong></p> <p>The biggest lessons have been about the combination of things necessary to transform care in highly complex environments. It's really important to make connections with peoples' intrinsic motivations and values and ignite latent energy for change. At the same time, to build systemic change, we have to utilise the powerful extrinsic drivers of change; financial incentive and payment schemes, performance management and measurement.</p> <p><strong>What has been your biggest career achievement?</strong></p> <p>Helping to make improvement mainstream in the NHS. When I first started in healthcare improvement, it was a lonely occupation, undertaken by only a few enthusiasts and visionaries. Now, 20 years later, the systematic application of quality improvement methods happens in most NHS organisations to some degree.</p> <p><strong>Has anyone inspired you along the way?</strong></p> <p>My greatest NHS inspiration is my mother, who worked as an NHS domestic assistant for nearly 30 years. My mum lived out her NHS values in her role, through her hard work, her kindness and positive attitude. She epitomises thousands of NHS workers in the extent to which she was willing to help others and do far more than she was employed to do. I aspire to be like her every day.</p> <p><strong>How important was it to be recognised as one of the 60 most influential people in the NHS and more recently as one of its top 10 opinion formers?</strong></p> <p>I'm humbled, especially by the recognition at the time of the 60th anniversary of the NHS. It can be very tough being a leader of change and an organisational heretic, working from the inside, walking the fine line between difference and fit, rocking the boat yet trying to stay in it. So, if people whose opinions I respect say they appreciate what I do, it helps me to keep doing it.</p> <p><strong>Many NHS reforms have been highly controversial \u2013 do you think they were for the greater good?</strong></p> <p>I have worked under a number of different political administrations, all of which implemented healthcare reforms. In every case, there were aspects of reform that I would have chosen to adopt and others I wouldn't. However, the role of people like me who want to secure the future of the NHS system and see it improve, is to find opportunity in the reform process and use it as a lever to enable positive change.</p> <p><strong>What's your leadership style?</strong></p> <p>I'm strongly driven with a sense of higher purpose, and I hope that I help to build shared purpose with others. My style is energetic, enthusiastic, hopeful and focusing on strengths rather than deficits. I hope I help others to see possibilities and opportunities that they might not see themselves.</p> <p>Marshall Ganz, who leads the community organising programme at Harvard University and is one of my teachers, describes the role of leaders as \"enabling others to achieve purpose in the face of uncertainty\". I think that is so pertinent for the leadership task in the current circumstances of the NHS.</p> <p><strong>What do you do to relax? </strong></p> <p>In the last couple of years, I've made a big effort to learn to ballroom dance properly. As a child, my school physical education report described me as \"angular\" and \"awkward\", and I kept those labels in my head all my life. I never dreamed I would be able to dance well, and now I can.</p> <p><em>You can find out more about Helen Bevan's work in the NHS and large scale change by reading the </em><a href=\"http://www.changemodel.nhs.uk\" title=\"\"><em>NHS Change Model</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network\" title=\"\"><em>public leaders network</em></a><em>, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>Governments have been doing a pretty poor job of saving the world recently. We're confronted with huge problems \u2013 tackling climate change, economic crisis, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/global-development+world/arms-trade\" title=\"\">trade in deadly weapons</a> \u2013 and governments are failing to solve any of them.</p> <p>It makes David Cameron's reported eagerness to put himself at the forefront of another global process \u2013 this time on poverty \u2013 either admirable or foolhardy. At first, it might have looked like an easy job. The UK prime minster is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/oct/24/un-panel-development-goals-ambitious-timetable\" title=\"\">one of three co-chairs of a panel</a> set up by the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon to write the first draft of the next development goals. The last lot, ratified in 2000, were the product of what was possibly the last global concord that actually did something good, or even got agreed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/millennium-development-goals\" title=\"\">millennium development goals</a> (MDGs) are global targets to reduce poverty by 2015. Some impressive progress has been made. Many things in the world are getting worse, but poverty levels are improving. So there is a lot of enthusiasm for agreeing a new plan on poverty, to take over where the MDGs leave off in 2015. It's Cameron's chance to put Conservative thinking on development \u2013 summed up in his phrase \"open economies and open societies\" \u2013 at the heart of the world's plan for tackling poverty.</p> <p>What made the MDGs special was the numbers. The goals aren't just vague aspirations, they are backed up by numbers, meaning it's possible to say definitively whether or not the world is meeting its obligations to poor people. It was that which gave the MDGs a shelf life far longer than the average UN declaration (a cynical UN staffer once told me that for most declarations, it's just a question of whether they hit the bin immediately or after a few months).</p> <p>But, as the PM may find to his cost, agreeing a new set of numbers is a bit more difficult now than it was in 2000. The MDGs were cooked up by a group of rich countries sitting in a room and deciding how they wanted to spend their aid to help poor countries (I exaggerate slightly, but not much). The panel that Cameron is co-chairing won't be like that; there are a lot of different interests at stake, and everyone will want their say when they meet in London this week.</p> <p>Most <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/feb/23/aid-to-middle-income-countries\" title=\"\">poverty is now in middle-income countries</a>, many of which are themselves donors. They're not going to take kindly to any hint of the big rich countries \u2013 like the UK, for example \u2013 trying to push them around or tell them what to do within their own borders. And many countries, including some of the poorest, are quite reasonably saying that the rich world has a lot more to do than hand over a bit of cash if poverty is to be ended in a way that doesn't destroy the planet. This isn't just about the usual list of aid, trade and debt relief (though that would be a start).</p> <p>There's also a serious conversation about tackling some of the world's big environmental problems <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/03/sustainable-development-goals-un-approach\" title=\"\">through new goals</a>. We're getting to a point where progress on poverty reduction may be catastrophically undermined if environmental degradation isn't reversed. And it's a tribute to the success of the MDGs that people think environmental issues could benefit from the same treatment. If the gamble pays off, that's great. But the risks are huge, too \u2013 globally, environmental issues have been among the most difficult to tackle.</p> <p>All of which adds up to a difficult job for Cameron. At home, he faces a Conservative party extremely sceptical about his internationalist, aid-giving persona. Abroad, he now faces a group of countries that may be determined to wrest more from the process than he, or other rich country leaders, may be willing to give. Some big compromises will be needed, on all sides.</p> <p>Will it matter if he and his co-chairs fail? Yes. If world leaders can't pull an agreement out of their collective hats that tackles something as morally straightforward as ending extreme poverty, then it's really time to despair. What hope is there for the more difficult issues of trade or climate if we can't even agree that we'll act together to do something about poverty?</p> <p>A good agreement on a post-2015 development agenda will be simple (not too many issues), specific (some numbers), and symmetrical (with obligations and commitments for all countries). If that's not what we get, it will be a sign of an appalling failure that will affect the poorest people most. But it will affect us too, since there will be failures to come on other, more difficult problems. There's no need to panic yet. But this is the canary in the multilateral coalmine.</p>",
  "<p>My colleagues Adham Tamer, Ning Wang, Scott Hale and I have been collecting Tweets containing the terms \"flood\" and \"flooding\" in order to examine how Twitter usage in the context of Hurricane Sandy might reflect lived experiences. In other words, we are examining the human and social data shadows of an innately physical/material event in order to see what it is that they tell us. </p> <p>Our initial intent was also to map references to flooding in both English and Spanish in order to explore whether we see significant geographic and linguistic differences in social media reactions to the hurricane. With the rise of crisis mapping and Twitter analysis, we reasoned that it would be important to note any potential differences between English and Spanish speakers (Spanish being a native language to millions of people on the US East Cost). </p> <p>Second, we see that these data become less useful if we want to draw insights at a finer scale than the county. The data are good at reflecting the broad trajectory of the hurricane, but perhaps less useful for more detailed insights. For instance, it is unclear whether the large number of Tweets that we pick up in New York City, as compared to other places, reflects the scale of devastation to the city or just means that New Yorkers are more apt to Tweet about such an event. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398902668\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351676303815/Local-tweets-on-storm-in--009.jpg\" alt=\"Local tweets on storm in New York\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local tweets on storm in NYC.

In other words, it is the absences on this map that are almost more interesting than the mapped results. The lack of published content in Spanish means that we are necessarily only including published content from English speakers in these representations. The absences in the rest of the country are also revealing. </p> <p>Why exactly are so few people in Kentucky, Missouri, Wisconsin etc. Tweeting about East Coast flooding? Is it because the act of Tweeting about such an event is only really likely to be performed by people in situ, experiencing the storm? Are people outside of the hurricane path simply not that interested in the event?

Those who died include an off-duty police officer, who drowned after rescuing his family, a man who died after a tree fell into his home and a woman who was was killed after stepping on a live electrical wire outside her home.</p> <p>But the first US victim was also one of the first victims of the Hurricane. <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-08-26/news/33406774_1_bronx-woman-rain-forest-el-yunque\">Bronx resident Kenah Huggins died</a>, not on the mainland US but in Puerto Rico, drowned by a flooded river five days ago. </p> <p>Since then at least another 132 people have died, from the Caribbean up to the east coast of the United States. This makes it a total of 133 people or more who have died. </p> <p>This map shows the locations of all the deaths we could locate.</p> <p></p> <p>The greatest number were in Haiti - which was not in the path of the hurricane but <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/act-alliance-alert-hurricane-sandy-in-haiti\">hit by extreme flooding in a country still recovering from the earthquake in 2010</a>.</p> <p></p> <p>If you look at the rate per million population it shows just how hard the smaller countries of the Caribbean were hit:</p> <p></p> <p>We are updating these details everyday while the crisis continues - and you can download the Fusion table below (to export it as a CSV file, click 'file' then 'download').

  "<p>Politicians, scientists and environmentalists have turned up the heat on ministers and officials planning to merge the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) with an oceanography centre, before a meeting to decide its fate on Thursday.</p> <p>Opponents of the plan, which is intended to save money, say the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/antarctic-base-ozone-government-cuts?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">merger would irreparably damage the institution</a> which discovered the ozone hole and is considered a world leader in polar research. The plan attracted further controversy when the Guardian revealed the merger would require <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/14/environmental-science-agencies-oil-polar\" title=\"\">BAS to use its skills to help \"de-risk\" investment for UK oil companies</a> exploring the polar regions.</p> <p>\"Only a few years ago prime minister David Cameron was photographed hugging huskies in the Arctic in an effort to stress his green credentials; I hope he can now reassure us that his government would not be so cynical as to refocus the UK's Arctic research on opening up the region to greater resource extraction,\" said Joan Walley, the Labour MP who chairs the environmental audit select committee. The proposed merger should be abandoned, Walley wrote on Wednesday in a letter to a parliamentary inquiry into the issue.</p> <p>Four of the UK's biggest green NGOs \u2013 Greenpeace, the RSPB, WWF-UK and Friends of the Earth \u2013 also signalled their strong opposition to the merger. \"Those who want to dismantle this leading scientific centre should hang their heads in shame. It is a grave mistake to take apart BAS when it is needed now more than ever,\" said Vicky Wyatt, Greenpeace arctic campaigner. \"Politicians should be working to help our scientists understand and look after these areas, which are under threat from the effects of climate change, not rush through daft plans to undermine them.\"</p> <p>The NGOs wrote to Prof Duncan Wingham, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Natural Environment Research Council</a> (NERC), which runs BAS and will decide BAS's fate on Thursday. The decision was to have been taken in December but was brought forward. That forced MPs on the commons science and technology select committee, which is investigating the issue, to call <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/121025-nerc-ev/\" title=\"\">Wingham before them on Wednesday</a>, along with David Willetts, the minister for universities and science. Willetts wants a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/british-antarctic-survey-cuts-merger?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">10% cut in NERC expenditure</a> and a 45% reduction in its capital spending by 2015. Polar research, which is costly, has been chosen to take a major hit.</p> <p>The planned BAS merger has prompted widespread outrage, with the former US vice-president Al Gore defending BAS as a \"globally significant institution\". The Tory MP Andrew Rosindell, chairman of the polar regions cross-party parliamentary group said the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/british-antarctic-survey-cuts-merger?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">proposal was \"utterly foolish\"</a>, while Jonathan Shanklin, one of the scientists who discovered the ozone hole in 1985, said: \"BAS is almost synonymous with the Antarctic ozone hole. Losing it would create a comparable hole in British science.\"</p> <p>NERC's merger consultation document stated: \"The oceans and the polar regions (particularly the Arctic) are 'frontier' environments where, of necessity, there will be increasing economic activity in the coming decades \u2013 not least because of increasing pressures on natural resources \u2026 A long-term vision is needed \u2026 to equip UK business and UK investors with the edge needed for de-risking major investment decisions in hostile, unfamiliar environments.\"</p> <p>Wingham said previously that all scientific institutes were under pressure to provide value to the UK economy. But he denied that a more business-focused approach meant the council necessarily supported drilling in the Arctic, although he said future work would provide relevant information to oil companies.</p>",
  "<p>Friends of the Earth has launched a campaign to shine light into the hidden world of political donations in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The political parties represented in the Stormont assembly are the only ones in either the UK or the island of Ireland allowed to keep the names of their financial donors secret.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/public_and_stakeholder_opi.pdf\" title=\"\">environmental campaign group claims</a> the secrecy surrounding all the parties and their donors including wealthy business figures may have led to \"some bizarre decisions\" in the area of planning and development.</p> <p>Theresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, has the power to bring the province's political funding system into line with the rest of the UK where all donations to parties have to be made public.</p> <p>A similar transparency regime exists in the Irish Republic, whose political system has been tainted with revelations about politicians and their corrupt relationships with builders and speculators.</p> <p>James Orr, from the Northern Ireland branch of Friends of the Earth, said it believed that further planning powers to local councils should be frozen until everyone can \"see who are the main party funders\".</p> <p>Orr said that since some power was devolved from Westminster to Stormont following the 2006 St Andrews agreement, the local environment had been \"paying a heavy price for the lack of healthy democracy\".</p> <p>He said: \"For example, there is totally inadequate enforcement especially for quarries and mineral developments, over the years out-of-town shopping developments have been the norm and new roads seem to be built for political reasons instead of meeting transport needs.\"</p> <p>Asked if Friends of the Earth believed there was a cosy relationship between developers and certain political parties, Orr said: \"We simply don't know and this is the issue. Because we do not know a lack of trust emerges between citizens and government.\"</p> <p>He pointed out that already more than 4,000 Northern Irish citizens had signed a petition to eradicate secrecy as part Friends of the Earth's Who Pulls the Strings campaign.</p> <p>In the past the parties, particularly within unionism, have argued that publishing the names of financial backers could result in them being targeted by republican paramilitaries.</p> <p>Orr, however, said such concerns were no longer relevant now Northern Ireland was enjoying relative peace.</p> <p>\"We feel that the reasons given for refusing transparency are illogical and unsubstantiated. On the face of it politics is now very open in Northern Ireland \u2013 party conferences are on TV, constituency offices of parties are open to the public and the names of electoral agents are in the public domain. Yet the parties want to maintain secrecy with regard to protecting private or corporate interests,\" he added.</p> <p>One of the world's leading experts on party political funding backed the Friends of the Earth campaign and also called on the British government to outlaw donations from foreign supporters to parties in Northern Ireland. Unionist and nationalist parties in the province are allowed to raise finance from backers abroad \u2013 a practice now outlawed in the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Ian McMenamin, from Dublin City University, who has studied business donations to parties in Australia, Germany, the UK and Canada, said the only other countries to hide the names of political donors were in Switzerland and Sweden.</p> <p>\"It is unusual because in most democracies now there is some transparency about who funds political parties. There is also a strong norm about banning money to parties from foreign sources.</p> <p>\"One idea with both the peace process in mind and the need for transparency would be to say that what happened in the past with party donations should be left there. However from now on they should take on the British system, which is now really transparent,\" McMenamin said.</p> <p>The last <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/public_and_stakeholder_opi.pdf\" title=\"\">Life and Times survey</a> of public opinion regarding perceptions of Northern Ireland's parties and their relationships with wealth donors was published in 2011 by Queen's University Belfast. It found that 77% of the public thought planning decisions were influenced by donors and 80% believed local politicians did favours for their donors.</p>",
  "<p>Farmers will need to grow different crops as rising temperatures and unpredictable rainfall lead to a drop in yields of maize, rice and wheat in developing countries, according to agricultural experts.</p> <p>The three crops are the main source of calories globally, but all regions will have to change their approach to what they grow and eat, researchers said in a report, <a href=\"http://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/24696/CCAFS_PB06-Recalibrating%20Food%20Production.pdf?sequence=1\" title=\"\">Recalibrating food production in the developing world</a> (pdf), which analysed the potential effects of climate change on 22 of the world's most important commodities.</p> <p>Agriculture and food production releases up to 17,000 megatonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 29% of global greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 according to analysts at the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (<a href=\"http://www.cgiar.org/\" title=\"\">CGIAR</a>). But while emissions associated with food production need to be reduced, climate change will also require a \"complete recalibration\" of where specific crops are grown and livestock raised, said the report.</p> <p>\"The food-related emissions and, conversely, the impacts of climate change on agriculture and the food system, will profoundly alter the way we grow and produce food. This will affect different parts of the world in radically different ways, but all regions will have to change their approach to what they grow and eat,\" said Sonja Vermeulen, the head of research at CGIAR's climate change programme.</p> <p>According to CGIAR researchers, climate change could cause irrigated wheat yields in developing countries to fall by 13%. Irrigation might help wheat survive stressful conditions, but the amount of water needed to do so would place unsustainable demands on water sources. Agriculture already accounts for 70% of all fresh water used.</p> <p>Irrigated rice production in poor countries could tumble by 15%. In Africa, many farmers of maize, which is not well suited to rising temperatures, could lose 10-20% of their yields. Potatoes, the world's fourth largest food crop, are best suited to cooler climates, so steadily rising temperatures are likely to reduce yields in places where people already struggle to meet basic nutritional needs. More than half of the world's potatoes come from developing countries such as India and China.</p> <p>Climate change will disrupt growing conditions just as farmers need to boost agricultural production as the world's population grows from 7 billion to more than 9 billion by 2050. Farmers, therefore, need to simultaneously increase yields while reducing their own greenhouse gas emissions, otherwise food production will be threatened further.</p> <p>The report cites several hardy crops that may have to be considered as substitutes for crops more vulnerable to climate change. Barley could be attractive for its ability to withstand salinity in the soil, as well as heat and drought, although more research is needed to determine just how much stress it can withstand. Millet, cowpea and lentils are also nutritious foods that can tolerate harsher conditions, although their tolerance to dry conditions has its limits.</p> <p>\"In short, extensive research needs to formulate targeted, region-by-region approaches that recalibrate agricultural production according to the effects of climate change. In some cases, this could require farmers to embrace entirely new crops,\" said the report.</p> <p>The switch to new crops, however, may not be to the taste of people. Kenyans, for example, like the taste of maize \u2013 introduced by the British to feed horses. They may take some persuasion to eat <em>ugali</em> \u2013 a polenta-like dish \u2013 made from millet or cassava instead of maize. \"This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/jun/20/mali-seed-food-security-in-pictures\" title=\"\">cultural challenge is another facet of climate change adaptation</a> that should get as much attention as plant breeding,\" said the report.</p> <p>\"The good news is that if farmers and food producers start to adapt now, they can stave off some of the dour food production and distribution scenarios laid out in this research. But they can't face these complex, interrelated problems, which vary from crop to crop and region to region, alone. They need support from the highest levels,\" said Philip Thornton, the report's author.</p>",
  "<p>Consumers shrugged off concerns about the state of their finances to spend more freely in the shops last month, according to two surveys providing mixed messages about the state of the economy.</p> <p>Hopes that the UK might be on the road to recovery were boosted by the latest snapshot of high street spending from the CBI showing the strongest retail sales growth since the summer coupled with a belief among shops and stores that business in November would also be brisk.</p> <p>But a separate report from GfK showed already fragile consumer confidence weakening by two points to -30 as the short-term fillip from the Olympics faded.</p> <p>Nick Moon, Managing Director of Social Research at GfK, said: \"Just as the economy moves out of recession consumer confidence dips again. While we are not quite back to the levels of this time last year, the index has not been this low in six months.</p> <p>\"While the Olympics are thought to have boosted GDP in the last quarter, the late Summer boost in consumer sentiment has now faded. The government will be concerned that the economic bounce will follow a similar path and deflate during the Autumn.\"</p> <p>Moon added: \"The fragility of the recovery is underlined by the fact that people are more worried about their own financial situation over the next 12 months. This certainly doesn't suggest there will be a spending boom on the back of the official emergence from recession.\"</p> <p>The CBI survey showed consumers responding to falling inflation by spending far more in October than had been expected.</p> <p>Almost half of retailers questioned (47%) said business was up last month on a year earlier, while 17% said sales were down. The balance of +30 points was the highest since June, when spending was lifted by the extra bank holiday for the Queen's diamond jubilee.</p> <p>Retailers were confident that business would remain brisk in November as the build-up to the key Christmas period began.</p> <p>Anna Leach, the CBI's head of economic analysis, said: \"It is great news that last month's sales growth has continued into October, at a much faster pace than expected, and that this momentum is expected to continue next month too.</p> <p>\"Falling inflation has somewhat eased pressures on family budgets, so that households are a little more willing to spend. But there's still a risk that ongoing uncertainty over the global economic outlook could dent consumer confidence, hitting prospects for the retail sector, while the scope for inflation to fall further is limited.\"</p> <p>The CBI said there was an across-the-board pickup in spending, led by clothes stores and furniture and carpets outlets. Clothing posted its first year-on-year sales growth in three months, while supermarkets also reported the sixth consecutive annual increase in volumes.</p> <p>Despite the sales growth, retailers still said trade was poor for the time of year. Of the 69 retailers polled, 16% said activity was good for the time of year while 23% said it was disappointing. The balance of \u20137 points was the least negative since April, the employers' organisation said.</p>"
