  "<p>Curves are to be banned in a new generation of no-frills school buildings, according to a government crackdown on what it believes is wasteful extravagance in educational architecture.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/adminandfinance/schoolscapital/buildingsanddesign/baseline\" title=\"\">Design templates</a> unveiled for 261 replacement school buildings also prohibit folding internal partitions to subdivide classrooms, roof terraces that can be used as play areas, glazed walls and translucent plastic roofs.</p> <p>The templates were published on Monday to allow architects and builders bidding for \u00a32.5bn of contracts on new school buildings to understand what the government expects from smaller and cheaper schools. The government is planning to replace the primary and secondary schools it has deemed to be in the worst condition as part of a five-year programme.</p> <p>On Monday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/30/new-schools-smaller-coalition-budget\" title=\"\">the Guardian revealed</a> that the new schools would be 15% smaller than those built under the previous government, squeezing space for corridors, assembly halls and canteens. It is part of a plan by the education secretary, Michael Gove, to cut school building costs by 30% and save up to \u00a36m per school compared to Labour's Building Schools for the Future project.</p> <p>The templates tell architects new schools should have \"no curves or 'faceted' curves\", corners should be square, ceilings should be left bare and buildings should be clad in nothing more expensive than render or metal panels above head height. As much repetition as possible should be used to keep costs down.</p> <p>\"A standardised approach should be taken, with the aim of creating simple designs that have the potential to be replicated on a number of sites,\" the templates state. \"This may be achieved by using standardised dimensions for similar types of spaces that are integrated into an efficient planning and structural grid.\"</p> <p>The prohibitions and prescriptions seem targeted to prevent the schools being designed by architects such as Lord Foster and Dame Zaha Hadid who have won prizes for school designs that employed irregular curves and shapes and innovative materials, but have been criticised for spending too much.</p> <p>Gove last year told a conference on free schools: \"We won't be getting Richard Rogers to design your school, we won't be getting any award-winning architects to design it, because no one in this room is here to make architects richer.\"</p> <p>Peter Clegg, a partner at Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios which has designed more than a dozen schools, said: \"It is extraordinarily over-prescriptive and it shows an extreme lack of trust in the architectural and construction professions to deliver schools to budget.</p> <p>\"Why are they not just telling us how much they want to pay per square metre? I can understand them wanting to turn the screw on the budget, but why do they not give architects who understand these things the ability to decide.\"</p> <p>He said bans on materials such as the ETFE plastic used as a roofing material on the Eden Project did not make sense as it was often a cost-effective way to bring light into a building and was cheaper than glass.</p> <p>The Department for Education said: \"Compared to BSF these designs represent a reduction in wasted space \u2013 15% for secondary and 5% for primary schools \u2013 whilst maintaining the same size teaching space, classrooms, staffrooms, sport, and art and design facilities. These new schools will still be bigger than secondary schools built in 2004 and primaries built in 2006.\"</p> <p>Guidance in the templates includes: \"basic specification solid core doors; no folding partitions; basic stair and balustrading finishes; fair faced concrete soffits ... no internal CCTV other than to the main entrance; reduced lighting specifications\".</p> <p>Mike Green, director of capital at the government's Education Funding Agency, said: \"These designs will ensure that new schools can be built to effective designs and specifications, be simple to maintain and energy efficient. And they can be built far faster than many have previously, and for far less money.</p> <p>\"Ultimately they will enable as many schools as possible to receive investment from the funding available and deliver an excellent environment for the children and communities they serve.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The Bank of England leapt to the defence on Monday of its new scheme to encourage housebuying after figures revealed that a recovery in mortgage lending has gone into reverse.</p> <p>According to figures from Threadneedle Street, households repaid more debt than they borrowed in August, despite the launch of the Bank's Funding for Lending scheme as an \u00a380bn scheme to cut the cost of mortgage borrowing.</p> <p>The amount of new loans to households fell by \u00a3400m and the previous figure for July was reduced, the Bank of England said. But it denied the decline undermined the case for offering banks cheap credit through the Funding for Lending scheme.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Early indications suggest the FLS is having an impact, but it is unrealistic to expect to see that in lending figures for August.\"</p> <p>Lending figures and mortgage approvals have remained stubbornly low throughout 2012. The Bank of England said in the summer the rising cost of mortgage borrowing was hitting demand and deterring homebuyers from entering the property market.</p> <p>It warned that UK banks were pushing up mortgage rates after being viewed as vulnerable to the collapse of the eurozone, forcing foreign banks to increase the cost of loans to the UK banking sector. Funding for Lending provides UK banks with cheap funds linked to a commitment from lenders to pass on the benefits to homebuyers. Thirteen financial institutions, accounting for about 73% of UK lending, have signed up to the programme.</p> <p>Paul Fisher, head of financial markets at the Bank of England, said last month that it would take until at least the end of the year before the success of the scheme could be judged.</p> <p>The poor lending data added to renewed economic gloom from the manufacturing sector and figures showing a sharp drop in petrol consumption.</p> <p>While environmental groups are expected to welcome news that fuel consumption has dropped, it will alarm economic forecasters who expect a strong pickup in activity in the second half of the year. The AA said petrol sales tumbled in the last quarter at the fastest rate since the financial crash. It said the fall had gathered momentum after a steady decline during the first half of this year.</p> <p>Petrol sales between April and June declined by 497m litres compared to last year's second quarter.</p> <p>The statistics from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show that, overall, more than two billion fewer litres of petrol and diesel were sold on forecourts in the first half of this year compared to the same period in 2008.</p> <p>UK manufacturing activity dropped again in September as financial data provider Markit said the UK had suffered from the crisis in the eurozone.</p> <p>Chief European economist Chris Williamson said: \"Overseas sales continue to be hit by the ongoing deterioration in global economic growth, with the eurozone \u2013 the UK's largest export market \u2013 at the epicentre of the weakness.\"</p> <p>The Markit PMI survey for September came in at 48.4, dropping further below 50, the mark that separates expansion from contraction. It fell short of analyst expectations of 49.3, and compares with August's reading of 49.6.</p> <p>UK manufacturers suffered a double blow of falling output and rising costs. Companies said the decrease in output was caused by a decline in new export business and subdued demand at home. Costs surged in September, driven by the rising price of chemicals, energy, food, metals, oil and plastics.</p>",
  "<p>After watching <a href=\"http://www.climatecrisis.net/an_inconvenient_truth/about_the_film.php\" title=\"\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, Al Gore's documentary on the threat of global warming, Adrian Tuck's wife asked him, \"What are we doing about this?\" Tuck, CEO at Tendril, realised he didn't have a good answer. He started to look at his own energy consumption and found it was challenging to get detailed, useable information from the local utility company other than a billing statement in his mailbox once a month. </p> <p>\"I realised there was an opportunity to have a massive impact on energy efficiency just by educating people and giving them insight, choice and control of their energy use in ways that weren't available at the time,\" Tuck says.</p> <p>This realisation became the basis for Tendril Connect, a software platform that the company has now sold to some 40 energy utility companies. According to Tuck, the Tendril Connect platform is now crunching nearly five terabytes of big data each month for these companies related to the energy use of their residential customers, local weather patterns, demographic and behavioral information. </p> <p>Analysing all this data, the platform enables energy utilities to provide their residential customers with personalised energy reports, conservation tips, and even automation of home appliances to reduce consumption.</p> <p>Energy savings vary depending on the customers' level of engagement. They can choose to receive reports, either by mail or email, showing their consumption patterns and offering energy-saving advice. The annual energy savings for customers who receive these reports is between one to three percent, according to Tendril's estimates.</p> <p>An online web portal and mobile app goes beyond paper reports to offer energy saving games, challenges and social media interaction with other like-minded customers. Savings from the online tools range from four to seven percent annually. </p> <p>Energy providers can offer their customers Tendril's home control devices like smart thermostats and smart outlet plugs. These smart devices automate the process of turning the temperature up/down or turning major appliances on/off based on rules set by the customer. Annual savings are in the eight to 10 percent range, estimates Tendril.</p> <p>Tendril's products are also helping energy providers facilitate load control and demand response programs. These allow the utility to directly control appliances and heating and cooling systems in the customer's home during times of peak demand. Energy savings from these programs range from 15 to 25 percent. </p> <p>Almost all of this work is with US-based energy companies, although Tendril now supports a large project in Australia and another in the Netherlands. The company is working to secure future business in Japan, Germany, China and India \u2013 all countries where energy efficiency has become a priority, notes Tuck. </p> <p>Homes consume about a third of the electricity generated each year in the US, and many utilities are facing mandates from regulators to reduce this amount. So it's no surprise that the market for home energy management products is growing and expected to reach $2bn by 2020, according to estimates from <a href=\"http://www.pikeresearch.com/\" title=\"\">Pike Research</a>.</p> <p>But it's also a crowded sector, with hundreds of companies now selling products and services either to energy utilities or directly to consumers. </p> <p>Tuck believes Tendril's emphasis on developing products to open industry standards will set it apart. Rather than trying to build everything in-house, this year the company opened its platform to outside developers and launched an application marketplace. More than 400 developers have already signed on, says Tuck, building everything from energy saving games to apps that control your home appliances.</p> <p><strong>The 2012 Global Cleantech 100 was created by the <a href=\"http://www.cleantech.com/\">Cleantech Group</a>.

  "<p>\"Solving two big problems at once\" is how <a href=\"http://www.agilyx.com/\">Agilyx</a> co-founder and president, Chris Ulum, describes his company's technology that converts difficult-to-recycle plastic into synthetic crude oil to make fuel for cars and trucks.</p> <p>The Portland, Oregon-based company is now working with customers in the waste and recycling industries to handle the 26 million tons of plastic that ends up in US landfills or incinerators each year, rather than being recycled. </p> <p>\"It's not that the plastic is impossible to recycle, but it can't be done economically,\" says Ulum. This is because the waste plastic is either commingled (multiple types of plastic in a single item) or contaminated (with things like food, dirt, paper or oil), which adds time and cost for sorting, separating or cleaning. The company estimates that 77% of the plastic disposed each year in the US falls into this category. </p> <p>The Agilyx technology uses a chemical process that heats the waste plastic to break it down into short-chain hydrocarbons and ultimately synthetic crude oil, which can be refined together with fossil crude for transportation fuel. What's unique about the Agilyx process is the way its system delivers heat to the plastic and the continuous batch process that moves the product along a series of four vessels, says Ulum. He notes the company now holds 5 patents for their technology with several others pending. On average, about 10 pounds of waste plastic can be converted to one gallon of synthetic crude oil with the Agilyx process. Their base system can convert up to 10 tons of plastic per day.</p> <p>Ulum says Agilyx is now working on four projects with three clients in the US. One system is already operating commercially and he expects the others will be online early next year. The company is also talking with potential customers in Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East. Average deal size will range from $10m to $15m, he expects. The modular system design can scale depending on the customer's needs. With the revenues generated from the sale of synthetic crude, customers can recoup their investment in 3.5 to 4.5 years, according to company estimates. </p> <p>Agilyx will install its systems on the customer's premises, where the waste plastic material is aggregated everyday. Besides providing the technology, Agilyx will build relationships and negotiate contracts with the refiners to ensure there is a market for the oil produced and for this work, it takes a small share of the ongoing revenues. </p> <p>Ulum co-founded the company in 2006 with Kevin DeWhitt, who now serves as the chief technology officer. Ulum knew he was on the right track after a discussion with his ten-year-old daughter. </p> <p>\"When I explained to her the problem of all this waste plastic and how we were going to make it into a valuable product, she got it immediately and said 'Dad, that's really cool,'\" he says. </p> <p>This intuitive appeal has also caught the attention of some very large strategic partners and investors for Agilyx, including <a href=\"http://www.wm.com/index.jsp\">Waste Management Inc.</a>, the largest waste processing company in the US, and the French multinational <a href=\"http://www.total.com/en/home-page-940596.html\">Total S.A</a>, one of world's largest oil and gas companies.</p> <p><strong>The 2012 Global Cleantech 100 was created by the <a href=\"http://www.cleantech.com/\">Cleantech Group</a>.

  "<p>Prices and profits continue to decline for solar panel makers with the average panel price now 51% lower than at the start of 2011, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industries Association. </p> <p>While this is tough news for manufacturers, lower prices have spurred a steady growth in solar power installations in the US, especially in rooftop systems for the residential market. This sector has shown incremental growth over the past four quarters. </p> <p>Not only is this good news for renewable energy advocates, but also for solar installers and the companies that serve this market like San Francisco-based Clean Power Finance. The company estimates that more than a third of residential solar deals in the US now flow through its online marketplace, where solar sales professionals can develop quotes, design the system and arrange for financing. </p> <p>Serial technology entrepreneur, Gary Kremen, founded the company in 2007. His earlier successes included the dating site Match.com. Nat Kreamer, chief executive at Clean Power Finance, says Kremen wanted to create an online marketplace for sellers and investors.</p> <p>\"Gary envisioned a business that connected companies selling and installing solar with companies financing solar via an online software platform that improved access to solar financing.\"</p> <p>Homeowners interested in solar power can be scared away by the hefty upfront installation costs. That's why many deals now depend on third party financing using leases or power purchase agreements. Because installers don't always have the resources to provide financing, they look to Clean Power Finance to serve as matchmaker bringing together projects with investors. </p> <p>Kreamer says the company strives to offer multiple financing products that are tailored to fit specific consumer needs and credit requirements. The company's practice is to charge fixed, transparent transaction fees. </p> <p>\"We make more money when our customers sell more financing,\" he says. \"We are profitable when our partners make money.\"</p> <p>Typically, the organisation that finances the system will retain ownership. The homeowner pays no upfront cost for the installation, but instead pays a monthly fee for the system usually below what they were paying the local utility for electricity from the grid. </p> <p>Clean Power Finance says it now manages some half a billion dollars on behalf of project finance investors, including a $75m fund for Google. Beyond simplifying the financing process, the company is working in other areas to speed the uptake of rooftop solar power. </p> <p>For instance, project developers often find that working through the maze of local zoning and permitting requirements can add time and cost to the project. With a $3m grant from the US Department of Energy, Clean Power Finance recently completed a database of local building regulations that covers more than 7,500 US post codes. Once launched, the database will be free to use for anyone in the industry.</p> <p><strong>The 2012 Global Cleantech 100 was created by the <a href=\"http://www.cleantech.com/\">Cleantech Group</a>.

  "<p>Why is it that, while women make up 49% of the UK labour force, they account for just <a href=\" http://www.racpd.org.uk/uploaded/Women-IT-Telecoms.pdf\" title=\"\">17% of IT and telecom professionals</a>? What's more, the promotion and visibility of Marissa Mayer, the recently promoted Yahoo chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, the number two at Facebook, comes as the number of women in the industry in the UK at least has been falling over the past 10 years. Why?</p> <p>There are dozens of groups promoting women in tech, from pub meetups to formal networking and corporate efforts, yet few seem to be taking <a href=\"http://the-pastry-box-project.net/rachel-andrew/2012-may-11/\" title=\"\">Karren Brady's advice</a> in her autobiography that pioneers in any field need to hold the door open \"as wide as possible, for as long as possible, to allow other women to march through it\".</p> <p>One woman who believes the problems start much earlier is Belinda Parmar, who founded <a href=\"http://ladygeek.com/\" title=\"\">the Lady Geek</a> marketing agency in 2010, advising corporate clients, including Sony, Ubisoft and Vodafone, how to recruit and sell to women. She's often shocked, she says, by the \"shrink it and pink it mentality\" of tech marketers, but that's hardly surprising when there are so few women employed in the industry. \"I have a four-year-old daughter and I want her to think that anything is possible, that no career in out of bounds,\" she says. \"If any other comparable industry had a female workforce of only 17% there would be&#xa0;an outcry.\"</p> <p>Today, Parmar launches Little Miss Geek, a book which aims to trace the obstacles women face starting out in the tech industry. It is aimed at industry leaders, government and parents, and is at its most persuasive when it states the financial case for inclusion: tech companies with women on management teams have a 34% higher return on investment, according to <a href=\"http://www.catalyst.org/press-release/73/companies-with-more-women-board-directors-experience-higher-financial-performance-according-to-latest-catalyst-bottom-line-report\" title=\"\">a Catalyst report</a>, while <a href=\"http://hbr.org/2009/09/the-female-economy/ar/1\" title=\"\">a 2009 report for the Harvard Business Review claims that the female demographic is worth around $20tn</a> in consumer spending every year.</p> <p>But there is something alarmist in the tone of Parmar's statistics and capitalised infographics: \"GIRLS SEE COMPUTING AS UNFEMININE\u2026 'I'D RATHER BE A DUSTMAN THAN WORK IN I.T.\" and it's hard not to feel a little downbeat at the use of \"little misses\" for women. Are the messages and pretty illustrations in danger of reinforcing the stereotypes, rather than dispelling them?</p> <p>What seems missing from the campaign is the celebration of women's achievements in technology. And while we can all think of the executives \u2013 Meg Whitman and Joanna Shields as well as others \u2013 it's those quietly successful women actually building great stuff that we need to hear from. The most inspiring role models, as Little Miss Geek's manifesto concludes, are those working on projects that young creative technologists can relate to.</p> <p>Rewired State founder Emma Mulqueeny has been organising hack events since 2009, bringing talented developers together with mentors. She says she has given up \"single sex\" campaigns. \"I spent two months doing everything I could to promote the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP33dwTRFGM&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUm6g92PeJeVQIEH8dWdpm3A\" title=\"\">Young Rewired State</a> hack to girls \u2013 and the sign-up rate dropped from <a href=\"http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com/2012/06/12/how-to-put-girls-off-from-all-forms-of-programmingtech-by-emma-der-mulqueeny/\" title=\"\">5% to 3%</a>,\" she said. \"It was because I shed light on it being a more male thing, and that's like social suicide. They think you'll only get nerdy girls if it's boy dominated.\" In the end, Mulqueeny recruited model Lily Cole to the judging panel \u2013 and female signups rose to 23%.</p> <p>Is it too simplistic to try and motivate women based on them being women?<a href=\"http://www.mildlydiverting.com/\" title=\"\"> Kim Plowright </a>has spent 12 years in tech as a producer and project manager, including work for the BBC and UK startups including Moo, Somethin' Else and Storything. She describes herself as \"the world's worst feminist\" for just wanting to get on with work, rather than compartmentalising \"female and male professions\". \"I do feel quite conflicted about it. My parents made no distinctions, so I just got on with what felt normal to me. Perhaps it's more about addressing parents and their attitudes.\"</p> <p>Little Miss Geek suggests that the \"ultimate goal is to make tech more glamorous and desirable to women\". But the act of programming itself is not glamorous, and the low-key nature of developing, perhaps even the male environment, is cited as a selling point for many women, including Plowright.</p> <p>\"It's a great field to work in, because of the people,\" she says. \"Developers tend to be good, straightforward sorts with a refreshing lack of ego, who genuinely enjoy collaborating. The industry wants to change \u2013 it knows the gender balance is off, and will probably do things to address that.\" For example cult craft site Etsy has announced grants to support female hackers this year while Google developed an algorithm in August to help identify when and why women dropped out of its recruitment process.</p> <p>Leila Johnston, writer and technologist-in-residence for the Happenstance project at Sheffield's Site Gallery, says: \"Women in tech are perhaps getting a little bored of talking about their women-ness now. Which is a shame, as who else will stand up and say it's OK for girls to hang out in the computer room every lunchtime, like we used to?\" Johnston was recently asked how much she really knows about technology. \"I'll always wonder if these attitudes are about me personally, or about the fact that I'm female,\" she says.</p> <p>Is it time to forget the tired stereotypes of engineers and technologists as nerds and geeks and boffins? \"My role models were people who seemed to do whatever they wanted, without caring what anyone thought of them,\" says Johnston. \"It might just be this attitude that gives girls the push to not care about going against the grain.\"</p> <p><em>How do we inspire more women to learn about and join the technology industry?

  "<p>The chief executive of EADS, Tom Enders, has dismissed fears that the European aerospace group's proposed \u20ac34bn merger with UK arms manufacturer BAE Systems will lead to widespread redundancies in the UK, saying that cutting thousands of jobs is \"not the purpose\" of the deal.</p> <p>Enders said the combination of Britain's largest defence contractor with the owner of Airbus \u2013 which between them employ more than 50,000 in the UK \u2013 will \"not go down in history as the deal with the most cost synergies.\" The UK government, which could block the deal, is seeking assurances on jobs and Britain's share of manufacturing work under the new company before giving the merger its blessing</p> <p>Speaking at a lecture at the Royal Academy of Engineering in London, Enders said: \"We have faced the same concerns in France, Germany, over here: does it mean are you guys slashing thousands of jobs etc? That's not the purpose.\" Enders added that the deal was about creating growth and would be \"great for Britain.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day a major shareholder in EADS has had added further complication to the proposed merger by urging the Franco-German industrial group to re-examine the terms of an \"unsatisfactory\" deal.</p> <p>The intervention of Lagard\u00e8re, which owns 7.5% of EADS, added a financial dimension to a transaction that has largely been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/27/proposed-bae-eads-merger-shake-up\" title=\"\">dominated by political concerns</a>. The combination needs the approval of the British, French, German and US governments, the latter being BAE's largest and most politically sensitive customer.</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re, a conglomerate whose interests span publishing and airport retail, released a statement criticising the terms of the tie-up, in which EADS shareholders will emerge with 60% of the business while BAE stockholders take 40%.</p> <p>Describing the terms of the merger as \"currently unsatisfactory\", a spokesman said: \"Lagard\u00e8re calls on the management of EADS to undertake, without delay, the indispensable re-examination of the project to combine EADS and BAE, to better take into account the interest of all the French controlling shareholders of EADS.\"</p> <p>Lagard\u00e8re's chief executive, Arnaud Lagard\u00e8re, is also the chairman of EADS.</p> <p>There has been speculation that the French government wants to see ownership shared evenly between Paris, London and Berlin, which would leave BAE shareholders with 33% of the dual-listed business. But it is understood that BAE and EADS are not prepared to alter the balance of the new company's ownership.</p> <p>Enders said he was relaxed about Lagard\u00e8re's intervention. \"Shareholders are obviously always potentially concerned. They invest to make money so it's not surprising that some shareholders are concerned about the return they are getting.\"</p> <p>According to reports, Germany and France are preparing to demand direct stakes of 9% in the merged group. Under the current EADS structure Lagard\u00e8re and the French state holding company, Sogepa, own 22.35% of EADS, while Germany's national interest is represented by a 22.35% stake held by carmaker Daimler. The UK government, which has a golden share in BAE that allows it to block a non-UK shareholder taking a significant stake, has voiced concerns over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/bae-merger-eads-uk-hammond\" title=\"\">impact on 52,000 manufacturing jobs in Britain</a> but has signalled that it is broadly in favour of the merger. A source close to the deal said the companies had done \"everything that they need to do\" to meet a 10 October deadline to agree terms, as required by the UK Takeover Panel, but governmental wrangling is now the main issue.</p> <p>Another source said both sides need the UK, German and French governments to reach agreement before anything is put to shareholders: \"Until we have government support or approval for the basic structure, we don't have a deal that we can put to shareholders. Britain's largest trade union, Unite, voiced support for the deal. Ian Waddell, Unite's national officer for aerospace and shipbuilding, said BAE had to reduce its dependence on shrinking US and UK defence budgets. \"I don't see a rosy picture going forward. I see the possibility of terminal, and potentially ignominious decline.\"</p> <p>Ben Wallace, the Conservative MP whose Lancashire constituency includes the BAE aircraft manufacturing site at Warton, Lancashire, said: \"The question nobody seems to know the answer to is, how does this help the company commercially? I can see how it benefits EADS, because it wants to divest itself of the control of the French and German governments. But I do not see how this benefits BAE.\"</p> <p>BAE and EADS declined to comment. However, the companies' chief executives made a renewed declaration of the deal's merits on Monday morning in a joint op-ed piece published in the UK, France and Germany.</p> <p>Ian King, the BAE chief executive, and Enders said: \"With the necessary political will and support, management determination, and proper governance, BAE Systems and EADS can produce a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Together, we would become a business with a global footprint, and a wider customer base.</p> <p>\"We would be able better to ride the cycles of civil aviation demand and defence spending. And we would be a business with the scale and stability to invest more in R&amp;D, and a force for greater competition and growth. All of this would deliver tangible benefits to our customers in each of the defence, aerospace and security worlds.\"</p> <p>BAE and EADS are working to a deadline of 10 October deadline to thrash out a deal. Enders and King indicated that the deal would end Paris and Berlin's dominance of EADS.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Mark Hughes hasn't enjoyed the best of times since taking the reins at Loftus Road. QPR were perhaps fortunate to escape the drop last season and have yet to win a league game this term. Bottom of the table and in desperate need of a positive result this evening, QPR host West Ham who make the trip to Loftus Road from east to west London. Hughes has brought a number of new faces into his squad but the influx of players has been reflected in fragmented performances. Can they turn the corner tonight?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Andy Carroll is on the bench for West Ham while Rangers start with Djibril Cisse and Bobby Zamora up front.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>QPR:</strong> Julio Cesar, Hill, Nelsen, Mbia, Onuoha, Wright-Phillips, Granero, Faurlin, Park, Zamora, Cisse. <strong>Subs:</strong> Green, Diakite, Taarabt, Mackie, Ephraim, Hoilett, Ehmer.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>West Ham:</strong> Jaaskelainen, Demel, Reid, Collins, O'Brien, Noble, Diame, Vaz Te, Nolan, Jarvis, Cole. <strong>Subs:</strong> Henderson, McCartney, Tomkins, Carroll, Maiga, Benayoun, O'Neil.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>The referee tonight is <strong>Mark Clattenburg</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>Hughes has spoken of cutting out the lapses in concentration that have dogged QPR's campaign so far. Reading capitalised on that in the last game at Loftus Road in the League Cup, coming from behind in dramatic style to nick a 3-2 victory. In the league, Hughes's side have drawn here 0-0 against Chelsea and were hammered 5-0 by Swansea on the opening day.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>\"Fans at West Ham are interested in the passion of the player and the commitment of the player, rather than all that pretty football stuff,\" Sam Allardyce <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/sam-allardyce-west-ham\">told the Guardian in this interview</a>. If the results keep coming, he may have a point, but Allardyce's side were jeered following their 4-1 defeat to Wigan in the League Cup and if the defeats keep coming, then the manager's style will always be the first issue that springs to the forefront of unhappy fans' minds. Since their excellent performance against Fulham at the beginning of September, West Ham have drawn twice and lost once. Carroll inspired them on that occasion, will he get another chance this evening?</p> <!-- Block 8 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996303\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: email\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Matt Dony:</strong> <em>\"Hughes' problem is simply that he hasn't bought enough players. A few new faces, and those lapses in concentration will clear right up.\"</em></p> <p>Very good, Matt.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>I've always thought Park was a peculiar choice for the QPR captaincy. Can't imagine him inspiring or motivating in the dressing room.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>I also think Jaaskelainen and Collins have been liabilities for the Hammers so far this season. Although Vaz-Te has looked a shining light.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>The teams are out from the tunnel and we are just a few minutes away from kick-off...</strong></p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>The game kicks-off</strong></p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We're off! Let's see who settles first here. West Ham pressing down their left inn the opening minute. Will QPR's makeshift defence have enough to keep them at bay this evening?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Vaz-Te and Demel looking to combine down the right flank for the Hammers, but Clint Hill does well to deal with the danger. A swift counter for Rangers is on the cards and Cisse looks to stretch his legs out wide right, he's checked and the home side have a free-kick that Granero stands over. He whips it forward but Cole is there on the edge of the area to clear under little pressure.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>GOAL! QPR 0-1 West Ham (Jarvis, 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>Oh dear, that is woeful defending from QPR. Nolan shanked his shot from inside the area but it looped to the far post, and there was Jarvis to nod home his first goal for the club. Where was the marking? Simply awful from QPR.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Credit to Vaz Te for some persistent work in the build-up to that goal, but can QPR respond? Onuoha looks to make some ground down the right but the home side look bereft of confidence and composure at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Nolan is at the heart of every West Ham move, just as he has been all season. An opportunity for QPR now, Wright-Phillips surging down the right flank and curling a delicious low cross into the area. Cisse looks to latch onto it ... but it's too far in front of the Frenchman and behind for a corner, which is headed away.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Carlton Cole is penalised for a shove on Clint Hill, but Sam Allardyce won't mind that the big striker is putting his weight about. The camera pans to Andy Carroll on the bench, such good news for West Ham fans that he is recovered in less than a month from that injury sustained against Fulham.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Diame breaks free of his marker in midfield, getting goalside of Wright-Phillips, he pulls the trigger from 25 yards ... it takes a deflection off Ryan Nelsen and behind for a corner. For a moment it looked to be looping over Cesar and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Good tracking back from the energetic Mark Noble, going shoulder to shoulder with Cisse down on the touchline. QPR have seen most of the ball since that opening goal, but look vulnerable at the back whenever the Hammers swarm forward.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Nice play from Esteban Granero, who starts a move in the West Ham half, spraying the ball wide for Wright-Phillips, before receiving it back on the edge of the area and hitting a first-time half-volley from just inside the area that flew over. That's more like it from the Hoops, and the move warranted a better finish.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> It's very tight and congested in the middle of the park, with little room to manoeuvre. Cisse attempts a low shot from the edge of the area on the right-hand side, saved and held low down by Jaaskelainen. Will we see another of Jussi's howlers this evening I wonder?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> QPR have yet to score a home goal in the Premier League this season but there have been encouraging signs so far. Cisse has been relatively lively, although to be fair, Zamora has hardly touched the ball.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Just as I say that, Zamora gets on the ball, but he's in the centre of midfield and not up front \u2013 what on earth is he doing so deep? Mark Noble is penalised for a foul on the striker, but that has never been an infringement in a million years. Excellent, dogged tracking from the West Ham midfielder.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Joey O'Brien hacks down Wright-Phillips just outside his own area. That's a definite free-kick, and the left-back is lucky not to go into the book there.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Granero whips the ball into the area and after a scramble on the line, it's hacked away! Let-off for West Ham that and the game is stopped as Winston Reid is out cold following a nasty collision with the goalkeeper Jaaskelainen...</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Reid hasn't moved for a while, but he is talking and seems OK. He isn't going to continue, though, and the medics are preparing a neck brace I think. James Tomkins to come on.</p> <!-- Block 29 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996302\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>West Ham sub: Reid off, Tomkins on</strong></p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> So Tomkins drops in alongside Collins at centre-half. That should encourage QPR and they immediately try to capitalise on the change, Wright-Phillips clipping a neat ball over the top, but Jaaskelainen is out quickly to claim low down. Andy Carroll is warming up down on the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Excellent move from West Ham as Demel slips in Nolan with a disguised pass, the captain checks back and chips a cross into the centre where Diame leaps ... headed away! It almost falls to Carlton Cole but QPR desperately manage to clear.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Cisse has a shot in anger from 25 yards out. It flies well over the bar and never in danger of troubling Jaaskelainen. That sums up QPR's frustration at the moment. Loftus Road is pretty flat.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Sky reporting that Winston Reid is completely fine in the away dressing room. He was out cold for a few seconds after that collision with his goalkeeper, but won't need to go to hospital for further assessment.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> O'Brien scrapping and fighting for possession and territory down the left flank, he does well to advance past Wright-Phillips and into an attacking position but following a lay-off from Cole, runs the ball out for a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Cole is in a wee bit of pain following a tussle with Nelsen. It looks like he has take one in the ribs and might be winded. No foul given by referee Clattenburg, who incidentally recently paid \u00a310,000 for a hair transplant.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> West Ham are the side in the ascendancy right now. O'Brien launches a long throw into the area and although Cole is off balance, he gets the foot on the ball only for it to evade a fellow claret and blue shirt.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Granero is penalised for a foul on Nolan, and Clattenburg isn't happy with his show of dissent. Still no cards though and Noble stands over the free-kick. It looks as though West Ham are going to make another enforced defensive change here, with George McCartney stripped and ready.</p> <!-- Block 38 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996301\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>West Ham sub:</strong> McCartney on, O'Brien off.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>GOAL! QPR 0-2 West Ham (Vaz-Te, 35)</strong></p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>Vaz-Te doubles West Ham's lead but again it is terrible defending from the home side. After an almighty scramble in the six-yard box Tomkins lifted the ball into the far post and there was Vaz-Te to prod home past Cesar at his near post. Appalling defending, and worse goalkeeping!</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Collins is let off the hook after missing an interception just six yards from his own goal, Demel getting in with a crucial challenge to deny Cisse!</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> The first player into the book is West Ham's <strong>Mohamed Diame</strong>, yellow-carded for a cynical tug on the breaking Shaun Wright-Phillips.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Fine save Jaaskelainen to deny Cisse! From the resulting free-kick the ball fell to the French striker on the edge of the opposition area, he tries an acrobatic half-volley that was flying into the roof of the net, only for the keeper to tip over!</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> West Ham are just looking to shut-up shop and get into the interval with a two-goal advantage. QPR have been abysmal at the back and immediately after the second goal, the camera cut to Rob Green on the bench. To be fair, I don't think he would have done any better than Cesar with Vaz-Te's effort.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Zamora gets a firm head on the ball from the edge of the area, but he sends it well over Jaaskelainen's bar. Playing against his former club, the big man has hardly been involved so far. Decent cross in from the right though.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Noble lines up a shot from 30 yards ... it deflects off Nelsen and flies narrowly over!</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Five added minutes to be played at the end of the first-half following that earlier injury to Reid.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> Cisse feeds in Zamora, that's the first time those two have linked up so far I think, and big Bobby opens up his body only to see his shot deflected well over. Corner.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>45+3 min:</strong> The corner is an abject effort that drifts over everyone's head and West Ham have a bit of respite now.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>45+5 min:</strong> Terrible challenge from Mark Noble on Granero earns him a yellow card. That was high and reckless. Chance for QPR to have a pop here...</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>45+6 min:</strong> Granero lifts it to the far post where Mbia nods it across goal, but the flag goes up for offside. Very poor.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>The whistle goes for half-time. West Ham are 2-0 up at the interval and look good value for their lead.</strong></p> <!-- Block 53 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996300\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: email\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Simon McMahon:</strong> \"<em>Evening James.

Noble trots over to take it and hangs it up to the far post, but Tomkins can't win the header. Still, a second corner for the Hammers.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Again the ball is aimed at Tomkins on the edge of the six-yard box but he jumps to early and completely misses it. QPR need to get a foothold in this game and fast.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Excellent work from Jarvis who cuts into the area down the left, drifts a lovely ball across which eventually falls to Diame to hit viciously on the half-volley ... palmed away by Cesar! Good period of pressure this from West Ham and they could be out of sight.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Granero and Faurlin are fine technical players but they have simply been outfought in the middle of the park tonight. Noble has been terrific, and Diame alongside him has thundered into every challenge.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> QPR have hardly seen the ball in this second half. Zamora and Cisse are on different wavelengths and the home full-backs are being peppered with balls down the channels. Still, there is always the potential for a cock up by Collins or Jaaskelainen...</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Mbia adjudged to have been eased out of the way illegally by Carlton Cole in the QPR area. A bit harsh, that, but Clattenburg was never going to let that slide given the possible implications.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Adel Taarabt, just back from injury, is warming up on the touchline and could be introduced pretty soon. At the moment QPR are devoid of creativity or any potency in the final third.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Double change coming up for Rangers...</p> <!-- Block 65 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996297\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>QPR subs:</strong> Taarabt and Diakite on, Park and Wright-Phillips off.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>GOAL! QPR 1-2 West Ham (Taarabt, 57)</strong></p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>It's an immediate impact for the substitute Taarabt! Wonderful goal from him, cutting inside off the left flank, beating his man and making half a yard before curling a fine shot from 25 yards past the static Jaaskelainen. He is booked for his celebration.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Well that will certainly make the last half an hour a bit more interesting. <strong>Diakite</strong> also goes into the book for a late challenge as West Ham were piling forward.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> It was a goal out of nothing but QPR now look resurgent. They've got plenty of time to turn this one around but are still vulnerable at the back.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Last-gasp defending from Mbia and Nelsen to prevent Cole prodding home at the near post. Andy Carroll jogs up the touchline once again, I reckon he'll be thrown into the mix soon.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Another booking, and this time <strong>George McCartney</strong> goes into the book for tugging back Diakite. This one might begin to turn a little scrappy.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Half-hearted penalty shouts for QPR as Cisse goes down in the box following a tussle with Demel. Fantastic flick on from Taarabt there to give Cisse the opportunity. The Moroccan has been at his pulsating best since his introduction.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Noble squanders possession and QPR can break from midfield. Taarabt looks to slide Zamora through and he's onside ... but the pass is just overhit and through to Jaaskelainen. Close shave for the Hammers.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Jaaskelainen denies Granero with a strong one-handed save. Cisse found Granero on the edge of the area with a pinpoint pass, he shifted the ball out of his feet and unleashed a shot that seemed to be flying into the net ... clawed away by the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> <strong>Jaaskelainen</strong> is booked for time-wasting after dithering from a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Oh Carlton Cole that is a horrendous miss. Nolan capitalised on a slip from Mbia, sliding in the striker who was one-on-one with Cesar, but he shanks his left-foot effort woefully wide. Pathetic attempt.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> A flurry of yellow cards for West Ham and I'm not really sure for what. First <strong>Cole</strong> goes into the book before <strong>Nolan</strong>, having a word with Clattenburg, joins him for dissent!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Noble lifts a free-kick into the opposition penalty area, it's aimed at Cole but he can't make decisive contact on it. That could be the striker's last act, with Andy Carroll about to be introduced.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Cisse is fed into the area down the left and he pulls the trigger ... saved low by Jaaskelainen! You would have expected the keeper to stop that, and he duly obliged by knocking the ball out for a corner with his feet.</p> <!-- Block 80 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996296\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>West Ham sub:</strong> Carroll on, Cole off</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Good, strong punch from Cesar to clear a Noble corner. Still no first touch for Carroll but with Roy Hodgson watching in the stands, he will be keen to impress.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> QPR are down to 10 men! <strong>Samba Diakite is shown a second yellow card after mis-timing his slide on Demel. </strong>Well that could nip Rangers' comeback in the bud.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Suddenly West Ham have the momentum once again and with Matt Jarvis persistently whipping in crosses for the fresh Andy Carroll, you get the feeling that if we are to see another goal tonight, it will be for the away side.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> A seventh West Ham player goes into the book! <strong>James Collins</strong> kicks the ball away and that means the east London club face an FA fine. Terrific play from Matt Jarvis, hanging up a delightful cross to the far post, right under the bar, which Clint Hill heads behind.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Fine save from Cesar to tip Vaz Te's half-volley onto the bar and behind for a corner! West Ham turning the screw now.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Adel Taarabt is coming deep to inject some urgency for QPR. He finds Clint Hill down the left and the full-back whips a fantastic ball to the far post, the defenders all miss it but Zamora is caught on his heels, the white orb ricocheting off his legs in cumbersome fashion and the danger evaporates.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Jarvis whips in another fine cross but Carroll and Vaz-Te had both misread his intention, running to the near post when the back stick would have been the better option. Nolan then fires it low across goal ... but it flashes past the claret and blue shirts.</p> <!-- Block 88 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996295\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>QPR sub:</strong> Hoilett on, Onuoha off</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Kevin Nolan is penalised for a foul but surely he got a solid foot on the ball there? Allardyce is rightly unhappy and Taarabt stands over this free-kick. Can he replicate his earlier wondrous strike ... in a word, no. He curls it well over.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Ricardo Vaz-Te goes to ground clutching his foot, trying to eek out a few seconds, much to the displeasure of Clint Hill and Julio Cesar. Hill and Vaz-Te are exchanging heated words, but nothing comes of it.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Carroll clears with a defensive header \u2013 he's playing the holding role out there! Zamora touches it to Cisse on the edge of the D, he has a crack ... it's deflected and Jaaskelainen palms away!</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> I have to say I think Mark Clattenburg has had a miserable game this evening. QPR looking to put some late pressure on at the death...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>Six minutes of injury time to be played!</strong> Where's that come from?!</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Faurlin draws another fine save from Jaaskelainen! I'm sorry for criticising you earlier Jussi, you have been magnificent this evening! He palms that away after a 25-yard piledriver from Faurlin.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Another West Ham booking, their eighth of the match! <strong>James Tomkins</strong> yellow carded for time-wasting.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>90+4 min:</strong> West Ham have a goal-kick and are in no hurry to take it. I still don't understand where six minute have come from.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>90+5 min:</strong> Sharp turn from Carroll and he is brought down by Nelsen. No card, surprisingly, but the clock ticks down.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>90+6 min:</strong> Carroll brings a long ball down with real panache before unleashing a drive at Cesar! It's parried and Carroll follows it up with a half-volley ... wide of the target.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>Full-time: QPR 1-2 West Ham</strong></p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p>There goes the full-time whistle and it's another defeat for QPR. You've got to say West Ham deserve it following an abject first half from the hosts, although Adel Taarabt gave them hope with a belting 25-yard effort.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p>The early goal from Matt Jarvis was symbolic of a disorganised defensive display from QPR, which resulted in another West Ham goal as Vaz-Te prodded home at the far post. Andy Carroll enjoyed a late run out, and Sam Allardyce will be mightily satisfied with his team's endeavour.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p>One footnote: eight yellow cards for West Ham. Terrible performance from Mark Clattenburg.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/01/un-report-action-need-ageing-population?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">new report</a> that came out on Monday from the UN focused, like most new reports, on something we already knew. The great news is that by 2050 there are expected to be more people aged over 60 than under 15. Something very big is going on, wrote Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general. He warned that the \"\u2026 social and economic implications of this phenomenon are profound, extending far beyond the individual older person and the immediate family, touching broader society and the global community in unprecedented ways.\"</p> <p>Demographic change on the scale we are currently experiencing does have a precedent. It was just a very long time ago: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/may/13/scientists-stone-age-boom-festivals\" title=\"\">Neolithic revolution</a>. The population expansion and subsequent sustainability as humans first settled the land and established permanent villages is the nearest precedent we have for what we are currently living through. Today the shift is from village to city, rather than from nomadic existence to village. Again there has been a population explosion as part of the transition, and again we are facing the slow down following a period of rapid growth \u2013 a little like a human algae bloom coming to an end.</p> <p>So what will a stable and older population look like? Our best clues are those societies that have already made the transition: look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/30/japan-life-expectancy-factors\" title=\"\">Japan over the past couple of decades</a>. Life expectancy will be very high and, barring years of natural disaster, should be expected to continue to slowly rise. Couples will on average have fewer than two children, so the population will slowly decline in size. There will be less overcrowding as this occurs. Transport will be largely publicly provided, and a large majority of the population will live in cities. Tokyo shows that it is possible for 30 million people to live in close proximity and relative harmony.</p> <p>There are other models in Asia to consider as well. In Hong Kong and Macau fertility rates may be even lower than in Japan. Across the megacities of mainland China there are schemes in place to adapt cities to work without private cars and, since 2009, according to a Washington thinktank <a href=\"http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Global_warming/G-20%20Report.pdf\" title=\"\">China has been leading the world in clean energy investments</a>. China is preparing for the demographic transition and a future in which many groups of grandparents only have one grandchild between the four of them.</p> <p>Across almost all of Europe, other than in the UK, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4768644.stm\" title=\"\">population numbers are either in decline</a>, or the slow population growth which exists is decelerating. In Germany and Italy numbers have been falling for some time. Ageing is accelerating as a result. When this is badly managed, it results in the young deserting rural areas too quickly, for the lure of bright lights and more young people.</p> <p>Where ageing is managed well, people continue to mix. As Aneurin Bevan explained long before my grandfather [aged 96] became old: \"I hope the old people will not be asked to live in colonies of their own \u2013 they do not want to look out of their windows on an endless procession of funerals of their friends; they also want to look out at perambulators.\"The elderly require far less care than the young. Most people even in their 90s are still looking after themselves most of the time. It is the young, and especially the very young, who require intensive care and attention, particularly if they are to grow up well adjusted. At times, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/22/oliver-james-love-bombing-children\" title=\"\">Oliver James so clearly explains in \"love bombing\"</a>, all of us as children need the kind of one-to-one attention over a long period of time that increasingly modern life appears designed to prevent. In this regard although we may sometimes talk with fear of entering a second childhood, the elderly are not at all like the young.</p> <p>And a growing number of elderly people provides more potential carers for the dwindling numbers of children in the world, the children who their children give birth to. This is part of the reason why <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/media/media_59795.html\" title=\"\">12,000 fewer children under the age of five died daily in 2010 than in 1990</a> \u2013 despite there being more children at risk, despite a billion still going hungry. Children in poor countries with surviving grandmothers nearby are far more likely to survive childhood themselves. As yet the benefits of grandfathers have to be proven, but hopefully they soon will.</p> <p>Finally, what of countries like Britain and the United States that continue to try to put off ageing through relatively high rates of fertility and in-migration of young people? It is most likely that people continue to be drawn into these two places because so many have English as a second language, and there is a surfeit of low paid jobs and other opportunities at the bottom of the economic scale. Delayed childbirth due to middle class women having to compete more for work for longer in these two more unequal affluent economies may have also played a part, but even here there is evidence that current demographics may help.</p> <p>UK public sector debt is forecast to soon exceed 80% of GDP. In July Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility produced estimates that this could fall to 40% by 2050 if migrants continued to arrive in similar numbers, and so share the debt burden. In contrast a zero net migration policy \u2013 this government's stated aim \u2013 would result in public sector debt rising to 120% of GDP by 2050.</p> <p>Over half the couples in the world are having fewer than two children each. This is partly because almost everywhere infant mortality is falling, globally faster today than at any time in human history. It is when this happens that people almost everywhere become brave enough to limit their families to an average of two or fewer children and so our average age increases rapidly.</p> <p>For a while in the rich world we need not age as quickly as we otherwise might. If more young migrants moved towards where the global elderly are concentrated, in our rich countries, this would slow down population growth and enhance global ageing as people quickly assimilate to the fertility rates of the places they move to. The future is bright; the future is grey, urban, caring, low-growth and green. We just have to get there.</p>",

  "<p>A long string of socially costly misdeeds by major private US banks have been exposed since the current crisis hit in 2007. The latest concerns an obscure enterprise named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_Electronic_Registration_Systems\">Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems</a>, or Mers.</p> <p>Founded in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/business/06mers.html\">1995</a>, this private company in Virginia never employed more than 50 people full-time. Big private banks (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, etc) and housing finance companies, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, founded Mers in order to speed the processing of mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Investors were willing to buy these new securities (bundles of Americans' mortgages). Most importantly, US financial institutions wanted the huge profits from producing and trading MBS.</p> <p>Different local procedures for registering mortgages and processing the paperwork for trading mortgages had been slow and cumbersome across the US, but financial mega-corporations were impatient \u2013 so they created this fast, computerized way of registering mortgages and mortgage trades. Mers achieved its purpose during the housing boom that occurred from 1995 to 2007. But when mortgage defaults <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/21/us-mortgage-repurchases-idUSBRE88K18120120921\">precipitated</a> the housing crash and then broader economic crises, banks and lenders used Mers to foreclose on defaulted mortgages.</p> <p>Mers, it now turns out, was lax and loose, as well as fast, in processing foreclosures. Beyond facilitating mortgage transactions, it often represented ultimate lenders (who alone can legally initiate foreclosures) whose exact identities were sometimes questionable. In so doing, Mers violated state laws that strictly regulate foreclosure procedures.</p> <p>On 16 August 2012, the supreme court of Washington state <a href=\"http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2018934163_mers17.html\">voted unanimously</a> that Mers had improperly initiated foreclosures on thousands of mortgages. Victims of such foreclosures can now contest them, and other states are moving to do likewise. The already badly depressed housing market has thus been dealt yet another blow \u2013 economic uncertainties multiply with the prospect of US courts becoming further clogged by litigation over these foreclosures.</p> <p>The Mers mess created by profit-driven mega-banks is relatively small compared to the other disasters those banks have produced over the last five years. The large private banks were major players in <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/eminent-domain-mortgages_n_1917391.html\">aggressively promoting mortgages</a> to millions who could not reasonably be expected to afford them. These financial institutions took extraordinary and excessive risks (often with other people's deposits) in the new MBS markets and their associated credit default swap markets. We know now that deals between the big banks and the rating companies (especially Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch) wrongly inflated risk evaluations of those securities. We also know now that insurance mega-corporations (<a href=\"http://www.thecasualtruth.com/node/262\">especially AIG</a>) could not deliver the insurance protections they had sold to banks and other lenders when mortgages defaulted and MBS values dropped.</p> <p>The private mega-banks' imprudent, often unethical and sometimes illegal activities were major causes of the global economic crisis since 2007.</p> <p>Conventional economics teaches that banks are financial intermediaries. They connect those with money to save and lend \u2013 their depositors and investors \u2013 with people and businesses seeking to borrow: a vital economic function. As trustees of other people's money, they are expected to assess, carefully and prudently, the risks of lending that money. When borrowers default, lenders usually bear a significant part of the responsibility for failing to see, evaluate and avoid such loans. Borrowers, after all, are expected to over-value their projects, just as lenders are supposed to play the role of skeptical, diligent risk assessors. Collapsed global credit markets in 2008/2009 exposed the private mega-banks' colossal failures to perform that role.</p> <p>In recent months, large US private banks and other mega-financial firms have been caught \u2013 and often <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/07/03/barclays_head_forced_out_jpmorgan_head_remains/\">fined millions</a> \u2013 for still other misbehavior. They have, variously: imposed <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/12/ap-impact-regulator-barks-industry-shudders/\">illegal</a> extra fees and costs on customers; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/business/us-said-to-investigate-money-laundering-at-hsbc.html\">laundered</a> money from illegal enterprises; and improperly pushed disastrous financial deals on budget-stressed city officials, as in <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765606101/In-the-red-From-California-to-Pennsylvania-places-like-Stockton-and-Pittsburgh-are-running-out-of.html\">Stockton</a>, California. Last February, five major US banks <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/10/us-mortgage-settlement-idUSTRE81600F20120210\">agreed to pay $25bn</a> to settle state and federal claims about their \"questionable mortgage practices\". Major banks <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/13/investing/libor-bank-losses/index.htm\">will also soon face penalties</a> for their roles in the Libor interest-rate manipulation scandal, exposed last summer.</p> <p>These unethical and/or illegal and/or self-servingly incompetent actions by Big Finance have proven to be incredibly costly to the entire world economy. Private profit drove all these bank behaviors and, even when penalized, banks' fines were trivial compared to the profits those behaviors realized. Thus, they continue and extend the list of big private banks' misdeeds. The public fumes, the politicians hype new bank regulations, the courts impose fines \u2026 and banks keep finding \"new financial profit opportunities\".</p> <p>Big banks' failures raise an obvious question: can finance safely be left in their private hands? If any public enterprises displayed comparably awful records of misdeeds, demands to privatize them would be deafening. Yet, neoliberal economic fundamentalism keeps the reverse logic unspoken and, by many, unimagined. Instead, public money and Fed-lowered interest rates keep bailing out and subsidizing the same mega-banks that so grievously failed their economic function and the public's trust.</p> <p>One obvious alternative to this deeply and repetitively dysfunctional private banking system is socialized banking. Once freed from neoliberal fundamentalism, the US could rationally debate and compare the costs and benefits of private versus socialized banks, and various possible mixtures of them. After all, the US has accumulated experience with the very different kind of banking represented by thousands of workplace and community credit unions. We can also draw upon <a href=\"http://www.governing.com/columns/public-finance/col-case-state-owned-bank-north-dakota.html\">North Dakota's success</a> for decades with its state-owned bank. Other countries' experiences with public and publicly accountable financial enterprises can also help build better financial institutions than we have with big private banks. Another alternative would reorganize all banks into workers' self-directed enterprises, where workers and communities affected by bank policies together direct and operate banks.</p> <p>To ignore alternatives to private mega-banks condemns us all to longer-lasting, more socially costly and recurring crises. That is the chief lesson of all the mega-banks' misdeeds \u2013 from misusing Mers to manipulating the Libor, to utterly inadequate risk assessments of the new century's financial markets.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the flurry of international concern over the European economic crisis, the American elections, the controversy surrounding Iran and the fallout from the Arab spring, it is important not to ignore Somalia. There is a rare opportunity taking shape there that deserves international support.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/somalia-overcoming-al-shabaab-threat\" title=\"\">crisis in Somalia</a> poses a danger not only to the Horn of Africa, but also to the security and economies of the world. Almost 50% of the world's maritime trade passes through the region, and the Somalian coast extends for 3,000 kilometres, from the straits of Aden to the Indian Ocean. Attacks by pirates cost the world economy more than $7bn annually, making the Somali crisis an international one.</p> <p>The Horn of Africa has become the military theatre with the widest array of international forces after Afghanistan. The US, China, Russia, Nato and the EU all maintain naval forces in the region to combat piracy. On the ground Ethiopian and African Union forces are mostly focused on safeguarding key locations in the capital, Mogadishu, and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=al-Shabaab%20site:theguardian.com\" title=\"\">fighting al-Shabaab mujahideen in the south of the country</a>.</p> <p>Despite the complexity of the Somali problem, there have been several important developments in the past two months. The first was the drafting of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19075685\" title=\"\">new constitution</a> for the country; then there was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/somalia-first-parliament-inaugurated\" title=\"\">appointment of 275 members to parliament</a>, whose formation all the clans agreed upon. That was followed by the dissolution of the transitional federal government, often described as weak and corrupt. On 10 September, the parliament elected a new president with a majority vote of 190 in a historic meeting that showed signs of national unity for the first time in many years.</p> <p>Last week I met a number of Somali politicians and activists in Mogadishu and came away with the impression that there was widespread optimism among the people after the election of Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as president. Now in his 50s, he is a former chancellor of the University of Somalia and has no record of political strife. Instead, he is known for his extensive work within civil society and for his efforts to bring about national reconciliation.</p> <p>The president is convinced of the need to rid Somali politics of clan loyalties, even though he belongs to the Hawiye, the largest clan in the country. Meanwhile, Mogadishu is enjoying a climate of relative calm, especially after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/16/q-a-somalia-al-shabaab\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab</a> withdrew its forces from the city. Immediately after the new president was elected, they tried to assassinate him by detonating a car bomb. Some of their cells are still active in Mogadishu, except that their ability to hold territory has suffered setbacks. The African Union forces continue to launch military operations against their strongholds, the last of which is the city of Kismayo, from which they have now withdrawn. On a regional level, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi-death-instability-ethiopia\" title=\"\">death of the Ethiopian president, Meles Zenawi</a>, has restored hope for a more balanced relationship with Addis Ababa. Zenawi was never liked by the Somalis. He cemented fears among them of Ethiopia's imperial ambitions, especially after its recurrent military interventions in Somalia.</p> <p>I met Mohamud in his office in the presidential palace in Mogadishu. Naturally, there was nothing about it to suggest that it was presidential, or a palace. Some call it Villa Somalia. It is ensconced in a fortified military compound guarded by Ugandan and Somali forces. Within it are located most of the state agencies. It is a target of constant mujahideen attacks.</p> <p>It was very clear that the president is conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on his shoulders: a state without institutions; a government without resources; a society torn apart by vicious wars; and perplexing regional and international intervention. Despite all this, he is still optimistic. His task in the immediate future is to form a national consensual government, one that will begin to build the organs of state as well as pursue a national reconciliation that will not exempt anyone, even al-Shabaab.</p> <p>But his country lacks the means, as well as genuine support. The international approach to Somalia requires a thorough reassessment. It has been confined to two priorities \u2013 terrorism and piracy \u2013 and has caused a wide cross-section of Somalis to view the international effort as a foreign occupation. Terrorism and piracy are symptoms of more fundamental and greater problems: the persistence of conflict and the absence of an authentic state infrastructure.</p> <p>At present the international community spends billions on ineffectual operations to secure commercial shipping against piracy. An equivalent amount is also spent on fighting armed groups and providing relief for people displaced by recurrent drought. But building a stable political system and establishing state infrastructure and an all-inclusive national reconciliation would be less costly and more beneficial for the region and the world.</p> <p>New players must therefore be encouraged to advance these new priorities; especially countries with historical, cultural and religious ties with Somalia. The Arab Gulf states with their vast financial resources can fulfil this role. As for post-revolution Egypt, it enjoys extensive respect among Somalis. This makes it possible for Egypt to exert significant influence towards reconciliation. The same applies to Turkey, which has a visible presence in Mogadishu through the projects initiated after the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14588960\" title=\"\">visit of its prime minister to the country</a> last year. On the regional level, South Africa can also play a major role in the forthcoming period.</p> <p>Much of the international effort has gone to waste in the past because of a lack of co-ordination, different agendas and discordant motives. The suggested path, one that focuses on state building and national reconciliation, does not contradict present efforts; it only complements them. The sensitivities of the various international parties must not prevent them from seizing this moment. Somalia today stands at the threshold of a new era. It needs effective regional and international support for its stability, territorial integrity and the security of its people.</p> <p>We must not miss this opportunity. If we do, the Somali conflict will infect many neighbouring countries like a virus and increase tensions in the Horn of Africa. Ultimately, global security and economic interests would suffer more setbacks and a deeper crisis.</p>",
  "<p>When future generations come upon the webpages and news bulletins of the last 24 hours, something may puzzle them about their contents. How was it, they may ask themselves, that the death of a<a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm-died-aged-95?intcmp=\" 122\"\" title=\"\"> venerable Marxist historian </a>could be seen as such a large shared national loss by so many people whose assumptions and worldviews often had so little in common with his? Worthy of an obituary, of course. But a front-page news story?</p> <p>It is not an unreasonable question. Part of the answer lies in the late <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm\" title=\"\">Eric Hobsbawm's </a>sheer academic productivity and prowess. He cast the net of his curiosity far wider than most historians. He knew so much about so many things in the history of so many countries. And he had an unrivalled ability to marshal them in clear prose. No wonder he was such a sage to so<a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/01/eric-hobsbawm-historian\" title=\"\"> many</a>.</p> <p>Part of the answer also lay in his longevity. Mr Hobsbawm was still writing until within a few days of his death at 95. His final book of essays has yet to be published. He was lecturing and broadcasting until very late on. He was not just one of the master historians of the era but one of the last remaining first-hand witnesses of so many of its decisive events, too. Few historians were as interested as Mr Hobsbawm in explaining the politics and economics of the present in the light of the lessons of the past. He looked the facts in the eye and drew his conclusions \u2013 occasionally wrong ones. But it helped him progress from the communist rigidities of his youth \u2013 and it may explain why the Soviet Union never published his books. A few weeks before his death, Mr Hobsbawm remarked that he was amazed to have lived long enough to see another global capitalist crisis. But the existence of such crises was not a surprise to someone who had seen it all before.</p> <p>Yet the one thing that, more than any other, accounts for Mr Hobsbawm's status in his own country was his readiness, at a crucial time in the late 20th century, to acknowledge the historical exhaustion of the dogma that industrial labour would overthrow capital and construct a socialist order. His essays in Marxism Today in the late 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 many of them reprinted and debated in this newspaper \u2013 marked the moment when the left painfully began to assess its failures and prospects. Some of it still has barely started to do so even now.</p> <p>\"We have no clear perspective on how the crisis can lead to a socialist transformation and, to be honest, no real expectation that it will,\" he wrote in 1978. More than 30 years on, we still live in that world <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/10/financial-crisis-capitalism-socialism-alternatives?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">today</a> and that tough message is still true. Making sense of it requires tough reasoning. That was always Mr Hobsbawm's kind. It is needed more than ever now that he is no longer able to provide it.</p>",

They are under threat around the world from the effects of bleaching, due to rising ocean temperatures, and increasing acidification of the oceans, which reduces the corals' ability to build their calcium carbonate structures.</p> <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the most iconic coral reef in the world, listed as a Unesco world heritage site and the source of $A5bn (\u00a33.2bn) a year to the Australian economy through tourism. The observations of its decline are based on more than 2,000 surveys of 214 reefs between 1985 and 2012. The results showed a decline in coral cover from 28% to 13.8% \u2013 an average of 0.53% a year and a total loss of 50.7% over the 27-year period. The study was published on Monday in the <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1208909109\" title=\"\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal (subscription)</a>.</p> <p>Two-thirds of the coral loss has occurred since 1998 and the rate of decline has increased in recent years, averaging around 1.45% a year since 2006. \"If the trend continued, coral cover could halve again by 2022,\" said Peter Doherty, a research fellow at the institute.</p> <p>Tropical cyclones, predation by Cots, and bleaching accounted for 48%, 42%,and 10% of the respective estimated losses. In the past seven years the reef has been affected by six major cyclones. Cyclone Hamish, for example, ran along the reef, parallel to the coast for almost 930 miles (1,500km), leaving a trail of destruction much greater than the average cyclone, which usually crosses the reef on a path perpendicular to the coast.</p> <p>The starfish problem was first recorded in 1962 at Green Island off Cairns. \"When we say outbreaks, we mean explosions of Cots populations to a level where the numbers are so large that they end up eating upwards of 90% of a reef's coral,\" Gunn said. \"Since 1962 there have been major outbreaks every 13-14 years.\"</p> <p>The evidence suggests that outbreaks of Cots start two or three years after major floods in northern rivers.</p> <p>In September, scientists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature announced that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/10/caribbean-coral-reefs-collapse-environment\" title=\"\">Caribbean coral reefs are on the verge of collapse</a>, with less than 10% of the reef area showing live coral cover. The collapse was due to environmental issues, including over-exploitation, pollution and climate change.</p> <p>David Curnick, marine and freshwater programme co-ordinator at the Zoological Society of London, said many of the <a href=\"http://www.edgeofexistence.org/coral_reef/default.php\" title=\"\">most endangered coral species around the world</a> were also under severe pressure from the aquarium trade.</p> <p>\"Corals are notoriously hard to propagate in captivity and therefore the trade is still heavily dependent on harvesting from the wild.\".\"</p> <p>He said the results of the Great Barrier Reef survey were not surprising and the challenge for conservationists was to limit the localised threats to give reefs a chance to recover and develop resilience against the effects of climate change. \"This is challenging but entirely achievable and there are many community-led projects around the world demonstrating this.\"</p> <p>Corals can recover if given the chance. But this is slow \u2013 in the absence of cyclones, Cots and bleaching, the Great Barrier Reef can regrow at a rate of 2.85% a year, the scientists wrote. Removing the Cots problem alone would allow coral cover to increase at 0.89% a year.</p> <p>Reducing Cots means improving water quality around the rivers at the northern end of the reef to reduce agricultural run-off \u2013 high levels of nutrients flowing off the land feed and allow high survival of Cots larvae. Another option is some form of biological control of populations \u2013 Gunn said there were promising results from research on naturally occurring pathogens that could keep Cots in check, but it was not ready to be applied in the field.</p> <p>He said the future of the Reef lay partly in human hands. \"We can achieve better water quality, we can tackle the challenge of crown-of-thorns, and we can continue to work to ensure the resilience of the reef to climate change is enhanced. However, its future also lies with the global response to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The coral decline revealed by this study \u2013 shocking as it is \u2013 has happened before the most severe impacts of ocean warming and acidification associated with climate change have kicked in, so we undoubtedly have more challenges ahead.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ed Balls conjured up the spirit of Clement Attlee's transformative postwar Labour government when he outlined plans to rebuild Britain's creaking infrastructure.</p> <p>The Labour conference rewarded him with a standing ovation after he pledged to rekindle the spirit of the summer of 1945 to \"rebuild Britain anew\".</p> <p>The shadow chancellor lightened his speech, and took a swipe at David Cameron and George Osborne for presiding over a double-dip recession, by mocking the prime minister, who recently accused Labour leader Ed Miliband of failing to be \"butch\".</p> <p>\"A prime minister and a chancellor destined to go down fighting together. And this time, let's see them riding off into the sunset as Butch Cameron and the flat-line kid,\" Balls said, alluding to the Robert Redford and Paul Newman film of his childhood.</p> <p>Balls also described Nick Clegg, though not Vince Cable, as a Tory, but the jokes were rare light moments in a speech in which he set out his strategy up to the general election and unveiled Labour's contribution to rebuilding Britain's infrastructure.</p> <p>As a first step, Balls announced that the chair of the Olympic Delivery Authority, Sir John Armitt, would offer Labour independent advice on improving long-term infrastructure decision-making.</p> <p>The announcement follows the decision by Paul Deighton, the chief executive of the Olympics organising committee, to accept a peerage to allow him to join the government as minister for infrastructure in January. Deighton will be at the Labour conference on Tuesday to discuss the London 2012 Olympics.</p> <p>Balls said he hoped Armitt would help build a cross-party consensus to \"break the cycle\" that has seen the deferral or delay of many infrastructure projects.</p> <p>\"The lesson of the Olympics is that if we approach major long-term infrastructure projects by building a cross-party sense of national purpose then we can deliver. And yet it took 13 years from the opening of the Channel tunnel to complete the high-speed rail link to London. Crossrail was delayed for decades. Successive governments, including our own, have ducked or delayed vital decisions on our national infrastructure, allowing short-term politics to come first.\"</p> <p>Balls said Labour would strive to learn lessons from the past and not repeat them. But turning to the era of Attlee, he added: \"There is another lesson we must learn from our history. Many people have said over recent weeks: 'This has been Britain's greatest summer.' But let me remind you of an even greater summer still: the summer of 1945, the end of six hard years of war, when our nation welcomed its heroes home from the battlefields of Europe, Asia and the Atlantic, and celebrated together the defeat of fascism.</p> <p>\" They were different times. But it is our task to recapture the spirit and values and national purpose of that time.\"</p> <p>Balls used the infrastructure announcement to highlight how Labour was prepared to embark on a major Keynesian stimulus of the economy. In his most tangible proposal, he said Labour would use some of the expected \u00a34bn windfall from the sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum to build 100,000 new homes over the next two years. If Labour were in office, it would also use the windfall to provide a stamp duty holiday for first time buyers buying homes worth up to \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>The announcement was the first in a two-stage strategy. In the first stage, Balls wants to highlight what he regards as the failure of the coalition to stimulate the economy, after cutting too far and too fast, by outlining Keynesian plans Labour would adopt if it were in power.</p> <p>Balls served notice that he would adopt a harder approach in the second stage \u2013 the immediate runup to the 2015 election \u2013 when Labour would take tough spending decisions as it prepared to inherit a fragile economy.</p> <p>Balls said: \"After the global financial crash, it was always going to be difficult to get the deficit down. And even if we do get the economy growing again, even if we do reform our banking system for the future, we're still going to face tough choices in the years ahead.</p> <p>\"But the longer this government staggers on with a failing economic plan, the worse it will get and the harder the job will be. Hard times will last longer than all of us hoped. And we cannot promise to put everything right straight away.</p> <p>\"We must be upfront with the British people that, under Labour, there would have been cuts and that \u2013 on spending, pay and pensions \u2013 there will be difficult decisions in the future from which we will not flinch.\"</p> <p>The shadow chancellor announced that before the election he will set out tough new fiscal rules that will be monitored independently by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p> <p>The Tories said the spending commitments by Balls from the 4G selloff did not add up. Matt Hancock, a business minister, said \u00a3600m had already been allocated in the 2010 spending review, to the science budget. Labour pointed out that Sajid Javid, a Treasury minister, told the BBC on Monday morning that the government had not yet decided what to do with the 4G windfall.</p>",
  "<p>Labour is 10 points ahead in the polls as it meets for its conference in Manchester this week. The Liberal Democrats, its only serious rival for votes in the higher education world, have dipped even deeper \u2013 despite (or maybe because of) Nick Clegg's anti-apology on the pre-election pledge to abolish tuition fees.</p> <p>Labour's position in higher education should be unchallengeable. So it's a pity it hasn't got a higher education policy. As we are now less than three years away from the next election, and a return to power that looks increasingly likely, this absence is troubling.</p> <p>Of course, elections are lost by governments rather than won by oppositions \u2013 as was soundly proved once again last time. Gordon Brown was kicked for the banking crisis and the recession. There were no pre-election mentions of radical-right deconstruction of the national health service by the Conservatives or a U-turn on student fees by the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>So maybe Labour is right to play its cards close to its chest. But there are two problems. First, voters may suspect there is nothing written on its cards. Second, if there is, they may suspect it&#xa0;amounts to little more than the current government's policies \u2013 only more gently and moderately applied. Neither is much of a rallying cry.</p> <p>In the case of higher education, Labour's record \u2013 sadly \u2013 is as a trail-blazer for higher fees. Of course, there are big differences between then and now. Former education secretary Charles Clarke's increase was only a third as high as the current government's, and the extra income was in addition to rather than a substitute for&#xa0;public support. Labour did fees but&#xa0;not cuts; this government, however, does both.</p> <p>But that precedent, combined with the need to cut the deficit, leaves little room for reducing, let alone abolishing, student fees. All the talk about a neo-Keynesian boost to demand in place of George Osborne's relentless and mindless deflation has been focused on investment in infrastructure.</p> <p>Although it is difficult to imagine more crucial infrastructure in a global knowledge economy than investment in skills and research, a re-elected Labour government is not going to boost recurrent expenditure back to levels under Brown. Even if it does, higher education is likely to be nearer the back than the front of the queue \u2013 which, of course, is why David Blunkett and then Clarke introduced fees in the first place.</p> <p>Even a subtly more leftwing Miliband government, immune to New Labour infection, will find it has limited room for manoeuvre on the macro-money front. But that is no excuse for not having a higher education policy at all. There are still important things that can&#xa0;be done.</p> <p>The first, and least exciting, is to sort out the current mess. No one seriously thinks the current arrangements on fees and funding represent a stable solution. They are riven with contradictions that may have made good political sense in papering over the Conservative-Liberal Democrats cracks, but are a horror in the real world.</p> <p>So there is a need to apply some good old-fashioned, and probably boring, principles of sound public administration. The punditry of shrill, over-politicised thinktanks \u2013 and vice\u2011chancellors' \"mission groups\" \u2013 needs to be ignored. The Higher Education Funding Council for England should be licensed to devise workable solutions. Truly evidence-based policy may be beyond our grasp, but surely not thought-through policy.</p> <p>A second, and more creative, challenge is to rescue the higher education system from the downward spiral of&#xa0;declining student numbers and dysfunctional competition between universities. Reinvigorating the widening participation agenda is key to&#xa0;the first, simply because that is the way the system can begin to grow again. It is also fair and just \u2013 and so should provide a rallying focus for all the Labour factions.</p> <p>Key to the second is shifting from the morass of regulation designed to police competition (and measures to contain the public expenditure effects of the chaotic new fees regime, verging on nationalisation) to new forms of public intervention, arms-length but with clear objectives. We don't need a national plan for higher education \u2013 but we do need a national vision (and enabling framework).</p> <p>Labour should make a start to develop a more sensible and more progressive alternative to the botched policies of the coalition. It needs to counter the wild claims of \"paradigm shifts\" made by Lord Browne in introducing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/12/browne-review-universities-set-fees\" title=\"\">his report on fees</a> two years ago&#xa0;(and mimicked by ministers ever since) by offering more considered, consensual and, inevitably, evolutionary improvement.</p> <p>Of course, Labour can probably rely on the majority of votes in the world of higher education even if it does nothing much, thanks to the Liberal Democrats' hara-kiri. But far better surely to deserve these votes \u2013 and win some more.</p> <p>Peter Scott is professor of higher education studies at the Institute of Education</p>",
  "<p>On the face of it, private providers of higher education have never had it so good. Long regarded as a threat by many in the sector, they have been warmly welcomed by the coalition government. And business is booming. Yet senior figures in the private sector are getting anxious. They say they are still wrestling with a system that was not set up to accommodate them, and until changes are embedded by legislation, they face an uncertain future.</p> <p>Private providers say there was considerable opposition from the last administration, with civil servants frequently barring their way with new pieces of inexplicable bureaucracy. The coalition has made no bones about its willingness to embrace private provision.</p> <p>For the first time this autumn, undergraduates studying a higher education course run by a private provider can access public loans of \u00a36,000 a year to finance their degree. This falls short of the \u00a39,000 available to students of other universities, but many providers say their overheads are sufficiently low that this price cap doesn't bother them.</p> <p>While many public universities spent the summer fretting about exceeding student number limits in popular subjects and incurring fines, private institutions were free to recruit whoever they wanted.</p> <p>Alan Jenkins, principal of private giant Kaplan's newest HE partnership, the Edge Hotel School, says: \"There is certainly a lack of hostility to private providers now, which is a real improvement.\" However, he says: \"It's not necessarily policy that holds us back, but implementing new models, such as changing the degree calendar, within the old system is harder than it should be.\"</p> <p>Though private provision is still a tiny proportion of the whole sector, interest from students is soaring. Total applications to the University of Buckingham were up nearly 90% this year, notwithstanding its \u00a39,000 fees. Meanwhile, for-profit BPP University College had a hefty 125% increase, and the private ifs School of Finance was up nearly 113%. This is striking at a time when applications across the sector as a whole have declined.</p> <p>Prof Terence Kealey, vice-chancellor of Buckingham, says that the feeling of otherness he had experienced since taking over the private institution has \"evaporated\". But he says many of his counterparts in the public sector don't share his excitement. \"I was at a forum with a large number of vice-chancellors and they were all moaning about how unfair it all was, saying it wasn't a level playing field.\"</p> <p>But while some in the public sector are smarting about the freedoms given to their new bedfellows, private providers fear insecurity. There is no doubt that this is a political hot potato. Legislation to embed the new changes formed part of the planned higher education bill, but this was shelved by the government earlier this year following concerns in No 10.</p> <p>Paul Marshall, chief executive of the Association of Business Schools, explains: \"Private providers benefit from being outside the system and right now they can expand provision massively, but what happens if Labour comes in and stops all this? The risk is very high for investors.\"</p> <p>One major area of uncertainty is student numbers. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has made it clear that the number of loans available to students at private institutions will not remain uncapped, and it is consulting on how to achieve this.</p> <p>Carl Lygo, chief executive of BPP, sees this change as inevitable. \"In this environment, where student numbers are falling and university leaders are panicking, if the public universities can use an opportunity to get the government to protect them they will,\" he says. Yet he is \"relaxed\" about the idea of bidding for numbers from a general pot, confident that BPP can demonstrate value for money and quality.</p> <p>Gavin Shreeve, principal at the ifs School, believes the coalition is siding with the public sector: \"The numbers involved in private higher education are minute compared to numbers elsewhere, so this is entirely political,\" he says.</p> <p>Lygo points out that long-term planning on the domestic undergraduate market is all but impossible until the loan capping issue is resolved. \"Where the government will have difficulty is how do you encourage new providers to come into such a controlled environment?\" he says.</p> <p>Shreeve's major bugbear, though, is over degree-awarding powers. His institution was given the right to award its own degrees in 2010, following an arduous application process. He is angry that the institution will have to reapply to the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) every six years. \"It is fundamentally unfair,\" he says. \"It was brought in with absolutely no justification, simply as a sop to the HE sector. Why six years? Why not five? Or 10? There is nothing rational about it.\"</p> <p>Kai Peters, chief executive of Ashridge Business School, which won degree-awarding powers in 2008 after years of battling behind the scenes, describes the six-year cycle as \"a Damocles sword hanging over one's head\". He shudders to recall the application process: \"It was awful \u2013 you needed a doctorate in QAA-speak.\"</p> <p>Yet in many ways those with degree-awarding powers are the lucky ones. The London School of Business and Finance has experienced the potential vulnerability of relying on a partnership with an established university. The private institution was initially accredited by the University of Wales, which pulled the plug on its validation business last year, following a series of controversies over its linked colleges. The LSBF signed a new partnership with London Metropolitan University this year \u2013 and that university has now been stripped of its right to recruit international students by the UK Border Agency.</p> <p>Prof James Kirkbride, LSBF's vice-rector, insists that it will be \"standing alongside our strategic partner\", adding that it would offer London Metropolitan's international students the chance to transfer over to LSBF.</p> <p>Kirkbride walked away from a career in public universities when he took over as LSBF's vice-rector two years ago. He says he joined because of the freedom \u2013 but he hasn't found it. \"Frustration has definitely been creeping in,\" he says.</p> <p>Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, says: \"Private providers, especially for-profit ones, who complain about bureaucracy demonstrate breathtaking gall. Private providers are tapping the taxpayer for off-balance sheet, unregulated, under-scrutinised subsidies. No one knows how many students they recruit or how many complete their degrees.\"</p> <p>Shreeve responds with indignation. \"Mention private higher education and certain people will say quality will be compromised. I say to them you don't understand quality. If you get it wrong, you keep your job, your university doesn't close down, and the taxpayer continues to fund incompetence. I get it wrong and I go out of business.\"</p>",
  "<h2>TEAM EUROPE</h2> <p><strong>Nicolas Colsaerts</strong></p> <p>The Ryder Cup looked like getting away from Europe early doors, with the Americans battering their visitors in three of the four opening-day fourballs. Only Nicolas Colsaerts showed any resistance, and he had to battle against Tiger Woods, Steve Stricker and Lee Westwood. Without the point he somehow salvaged by raking in a series of ludicrous putts and clacking a number of approaches tight to the pin, Europe would have been jiggered from the get-go. The woefully misfiring Westwood had the good grace to spend most of the round loudly guffawing at his partner's escapology with a look of incredulity and glee writ large across his otherwise flustered coupon. The score at the end of the first day: USA 5-3 Belgium (and Europe).</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Luke Donald</strong></p> <p>If one decision won the Ryder Cup for Europe, it was surely Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal opting to send out Donald in the opening singles match. Pretty much everyone assumed the show would open with part two of Bubba/Poulter \u2013 surely a shoo-in for a future Peter Morgan play \u2013 but Ollie second-guessed Davis Love III, perhaps surmising that Poults the Entertainer would have got caught up in a sideshow to the detriment of Poults the Scrapper. Instead Donald came out, clipped the gregarious Bubba with ruthless efficiency \u2013 forget those two short putts he missed to close out the match, he was five under through 17 \u2013 and silenced the crowd eventually but silenced them early enough to send a signal all the way down the leaderboard, while allowing Poulter to go about his business in relative obscurity elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Sergio Garc\u00eda</strong></p> <p>This is the Ryder Cup. He's Sergio Garc\u00eda. Next.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Peter Hanson</strong></p> <p>According to the rumour mill, the big man had a full and frank exchange of views with his captain regarding his non-selection after a piss-poor showing in the Friday fourballs. How important must their row have been? It would have showed to Ollie that every single member of his team wanted it, and wanted it bad, and given the captain extra succour, which he in turn was then able to transmit back to his players for that tearful call to arms on Saturday night. So that's how important their row must have been. Hanson also kept pestering the in-form Jason Dufner, enough to send a wee bit more nervous energy pinging around Medinah. No points but his contribution was important in a way that can't be measured. In a way that actually was not measured, admittedly, but we're all adult enough to catch the drift of these elaborate concepts.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Martin Kaymer</strong></p> <p>A player with absolutely no confidence whatsoever in his form or in himself. A shy chap who suddenly found himself in the eye of a storm \u2013 having surely never believed it would come down to his match \u2013 with the whole world waiting for him to fail. A German who, like his legendary compatriot Bernhard Langer, faced a putt for the Ryder Cup with a pitchmark on his line. A man who swallowed hard, decided he'd be damned if he was going to introduce himself to Langer's demons any time soon and hit his ball decisively into the cup.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Paul Lawrie</strong></p> <p>Lawrie's Open win of 1999 at Carnoustie is still, outrageously and disgracefully, put down to Jean van de Velde's collapse. No matter that the Aberdonian shot a final-day 67 when the rest of the field were moaning and grizzling like bairns about the long grass. No matter that his four iron into the 18th during the subsequent play-off was one of the great <em>carpe diem</em> moments in the history of all golf. So how lovely for him to rout the in-form Brandt Snedeker 5&amp;3 in the singles. He should have been picked more often, too: he was four under with his own ball in the Friday fourballs. Few will have the brazen cheek to question his ability now.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Graeme McDowell</strong></p> <p>G-Mac sunk the winning putt at Celtic Manor in 2010 and in a funny way he did the same thing here, only at the other end of proceedings. He put away a missable putt to win his foursomes with Wee-Mac on Friday morning, having let a three-hole lead slip. If that had not gone in, Europe would not have had their first point on the board and we wouldn't be here now. Also, he should get credit for wandering around in a manner which suggested he clearly wasn't having any truck with defeat. Poulter minus the shouting and the sensational putting but hey, you can't have everything.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Rory McIlroy</strong></p> <p>The only man to take to the Ryder Cup tee while still eating his breakfast.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Francesco Molinari</strong></p> <p>Molinari has shown an occasional tendency to wobble when the heat is turned up \u2013 witness his spurning of the Scottish Open title earlier this year \u2013 but when the pressure was on in the singles, he repelled a charge from the greatest player of our age not once but thrice. The final fightback was breathtaking: having thinned a chip on the 17th, then driven into a bunker on the 18th, the old problems looked to have resurfaced. But he desperately steadied himself and clipped a gorgeous iron into the green, where this time it would be Tiger who would suffer from temperature issues. It was the shot that won the Ryder Cup for Europe. Tendency to wobble? Oh, I don't think so.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Ian Poulter</strong></p> <p>Poulter could have lost his singles match 10&amp;8 and still deserved the man-of-the-tournament award. Turning round a Saturday afternoon fourball with five birdies in a row would be the high-water mark for any normal player, especially as he appeared to squeeze most of the jelly out of his eyeballs when screaming in delight on 16. But it's his antics back on the 1st tee, taking on the crowd and Bubba amid pantomime scenes, that will live longest in the memory and must have made the Americans wonder exactly what the hell they were dealing with. \"Don't get scared, Poulter!\" shouted some wag down the 18th on Saturday morning. Oh, Poulter didn't get scared.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Justin Rose</strong></p> <p>Up to the Sunday singles the only European player to have ever been spotted as a young man purchasing foodstuffs from late-night Basingstoke kebab emporium Chick-Mex had enjoyed a solid Ryder Cup, if not a great one. After 16 brave and battling holes in the singles against the legendary Phil Mickelson, it was still a case of nearly-but-not-quite. But then he raked in a monster on the 17th to level the match, jigged around like a penguin who had been taking unwise choreographic advice from Peter Crouch and stroked in a putt he had no right to make on the 18th to steal the game. This was against one of the greatest players to have lived. Kids of Europe, if you get enough of those large doners down your neck, our long-term future in this event is assured.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Lee Westwood</strong></p> <p>Westwood was a shambles for two and a half days. Even the two holes he won on the front nine of his singles match were as a result of tiddlers missed by Matt Kuchar. (Naturally he gave one of them back with a lame short prod of his own). But with the scoreboard turning blue, Westwood realised the importance of getting his act together and so he finally stopped messing about. His 25-footer on the 15th, effectively to seal the match after a rare hot streak with the flat stick, was as good a putt as was sunk all week. Kuchar made him tap in from one and a half feet to seal the win, an outrageous insult under most circumstances, but Westwood took it in good humour, perhaps aware that, if he had been playing against himself, he'd have demanded to see it too. A gent who stepped up for Europe when it really mattered and not for the first time either.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal </strong>(non-playing captain)</p> <p>OK, so maybe he should not have kept picking Westwood during the first two days. But perhaps he knew exactly how things were going to pan out and that Westwood would require three and a half rounds to get going, before putting in a crucial shift. Otherwise Ollie was pretty much bang on, setting the tone from the opening speeches to his emotional valediction on Sunday evening. You would need a heart of stone not to have been in floods when, during an interview with Sky, he absent-mindedly began talking to Seve \u2013 \"This is for you \u2026\" \u2013 before realising he was on camera and correcting himself. \"This was for him \u2026\" was all he managed by way of continuation, before burying his face in his cap for a wholly deserved sob. It was heartbreaking and life-affirming at the same time, as all the best sporting moments should be. And those are the ghosts of Brookline vanished, too.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Seve Ballesteros</strong> (vibes)</p> <p>Well, y'know. And is there anything more fitting than Europe having won like this on a course set up so players can drive like madmen and then fashion ludicrous escapes?</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <h2>TEAM USA</h2> <p><strong>Keegan Bradley</strong></p> <p>America's player of the tournament. Bubba got all the credit for whipping the crowd up but really most of the early palaver was down to the 2011 US PGA champion, who set about sinking a preposterous number of putts on the opening day and running around like Marco Tardelli in the 1982 World Cup final. Had by far and away the most haunted thousand-yard stare of the entire US team in the closing ceremony. He really did care quite a lot. He'll be winning a few majors down the years.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Jason Dufner</strong></p> <p>Spent the entire week wandering around like a man wondering if he had left the gas on but deciding that it will be OK either way because he's got a pretty good insurance policy. Three points from four, the last won when he flicked away Peter Hanson, who had been coming back at him in determined fashion, by raising an eyebrow. Took to the stage in what could best be described as a carefree mooch, both hands in pockets, like a gentleman popping down the road to see if he could grab a pint at the local before lasties, but no worries if he doesn't make the bell, he might have a couple of cans back at home in the fridge. Scruffy and slightly overweight, give or take a splash of genius, he is each and every one of us. Only he's jumped the rope.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Jim Furyk</strong></p> <p>Showed his usual fighting spirit from beginning to end, even though it didn't quite work out for him. Unlucky to lose to the Macs on the opening day, he made damn sure it did not happen again with birdie on the opening hole against the pair on Saturday. He never relinquished that lead. And what could he do in the singles, up against both Sergio and Seve? He was a dimple away from going dormie two on the 16th, celebrating a putt which was dropping but then outrageously decided to pop back out again, then saw his attempt at a long-range up and down from the back of the 18th miss by a coat of paint. You know who was keeping those balls out? Yep. Despite it all, he was gentlemanliness personified. Apart from during the closing ceremony, that is, where he was a picture of seething malevolence as a Scottish folk band jigged gleefully in front of him, heidrum-hodruming right up in the poor guy's grille.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Dustin Johnson</strong></p> <p>The Ryder Cup is perhaps the perfect arena for Big Dustin, who is arguably the most talented player on the entire circuit but certainly the most inconsistent. In matchplay conditions, though, he can have his thundering meltdowns and move on without having suffered too much pain. Having needlessly shed a two-hole lead to Colsaerts in the singles, missing short putts and toying with water, he hit a towering long iron into the 14th to set up birdie, the first of three holes in a row to close out a match in the brisk manner of a hunter twisting a rabbit's neck. Three wins from three, without making any fuss, a gentle giant.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Zach Johnson</strong></p> <p>A tenacious wee irritant, a scrapper of the highest quality. Denied a four-from-four record only by Ian Poulter's frankly silly putting display at the tail end of the Saturday fourballs. During the closing ceremony was by some distance the American to appear most personally affronted by defeat. The look on his face! The narrowing of the eyes! Now there's a man who understands how important the Ryder Cup is.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Matt Kuchar</strong></p> <p>The incredible smiling man. He even managed a thin-lipped version during the closing ceremony, despite his putter having cooled on him \u2013 and Westwood's having turned inexplicably molten \u2013 at exactly the wrong time. Otherwise a consistent thorn in Europe's side, winning both of his fourballs.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Phil Mickelson</strong></p> <p>Lefty has never been the greatest at the Ryder Cup but this looked like finally being his year. He formed a majestic pairing with the rookie Keegan Bradley, the two dovetailing perfectly, the old boy taking up the slack when the young pup ran out of steam. The perfect Ryder Cup was in the making \u2013 until Rose raked in that astonishing birdie monster on the 17th in the singles. When the Englishman completed his smash and grab on the final green with a granite pressure putt, it was a hammer blow to Mickelson, and the Americans, who had now lost all five of their opening matches. Mickelson's reaction to having his pocket picked? A warm smile and generous congratulations. What a sport. If Seve really is pulling the strings somewhere, perhaps he could set up some sort of pulley mechanism that'd finally deliver a US Open to one of the game's gents. Seve?</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Webb Simpson</strong></p> <p>Came roaring out of the blocks in the singles and would have had a three-hole lead after four had Poulter not chipped in outrageously at the 1st. Was denied by Poulter and Rose scrapping like madmen in the Saturday morning foursomes but otherwise delivered two easy victories over the first two days. It is always nice to see a relatively unheralded major winner prove he has what it takes to stay at the very top and Simpson gave notice of his intention not to be a one-hit wonder.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Brandt Snedeker</strong></p> <p>He was beaten by the Macs, he beat the Macs, and he was smoked by Paul Lawrie. A mixed bag but the guy's just won $10m at the FedEx and must still be spinning. Plus, like his team-mate Dufner, Snedeker exudes the carefree manner of a punter who's just taken a gamble to jump the rope and see how long he can get away with it \u2013 albeit jump the rope more athletically.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Steve Stricker</strong></p> <p>His putter wasn't as hot as it usually is, and the poor man ended the tournament as the Bizarro Poulter, with a 0-4 record, and no points to show for his troubles. But consider his matches for a minute: he lost 2&amp;1 in his opening foursomes and his other three games by one hole. And if his putt at the 18th on Saturday afternoon hadn't ridden the wall of death round the back of the cup and squirmed out, he would have denied Garcia and Donald the point at 10-4 which started Europe's revival. The thin lines between success and failure can be measured by the width of a dimple. He also had to deal with the preposterous opening-day putting of Colsaerts, accepting blow after blow with a dignified stoicism.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Bubba Watson</strong></p> <p>It would get very odd if people carried on like this every week but the Ryder Cup calls for a sprinkling of showmanship and Bubba has it coming out of his ears like hair pokes from under his visor. It takes a special kind of star to engineer a brouhaha with the express intention of teeing off amid the tumult, then run down the fairway high-fiving half the gallery. And it takes a special kind of golfer to deliver two huge fourball victories and make the usually ice-cool Donald flustered enough to miss a couple of short match-clinching putts.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Tiger Woods</strong></p> <p>As anybody who witnessed the great man's meltdown on the 16th tee at the Masters this year will know \u2013 he missed the green by 40 yards with a wedge, then hoofed the club along the ground as his soul departed for a voyage in the funk mothership \u2013 when Tiger struggles, he really struggles. Which is what he did on the front nine at Medinah, flaying drive after drive into the trees and misjudging his short irons woefully. And yet coming home he was every inch the 14-time major winner, fighting and scrapping to the end in every match. OK, so he ended up with little to show for it. But you have to wonder if his concession to Francisco Molinari at the last on Sunday will, in time, be seen as an act of sportsmanship right up there with Jack Nicklaus's to Tony Jacklin at Birkdale in 1969. Having missed his short putt to win the match, Tiger seemed instinctively to realise that Europe's comeback deserved outright victory, that the Seve Factor was a story that needed a positive conclusion and that \u2013 to paraphrase Big Jack \u2013 he did not think Molinari would miss that but he didn't want to give him the chance. Tiger might not have the greatest Ryder Cup record, not by a long chalk, but this concession alone is some legacy to leave the competition. One of the great sporting gestures.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Davis Love III </strong>(non-playing captain)</p> <p>Having built a 10-6 lead going into the singles, the American captain can hardly be said to have got much wrong during the week. Within minutes of suffering the most painful defeat of any US captain in Ryder Cup history he was in front of the cameras, warmly congratulating his opposite number, Olaz\u00e1bal, evoking the Spirit of Seve \u2013 \"He was obviously here for that one point they needed!\" \u2013 and insisting that any heat should be directed at him and not his proud players. \"I hope they put it all on me, because these guys put a lot into this. They played very, very well. We're going to be bitterly disappointed but it was a good Ryder Cup and it was good for golf. It wasn't good for us but it was good for golf.\" Europe wouldn't have had a Homeric singles odyssey to embark on had they not been facing the strongest US team since 1981, when America travelled to Walton Heath and gave the home side a frightful smack in the mouth. Captain Love, for his efforts, should be applauded. Without his excellence, we'd be talking about a very average Ryder Cup right now.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p>",
  "<p>The retreat of western forces from Afghanistan could come sooner than expected, the head of Nato has said as he conceded that the recent Taliban strategy of \"green on blue\" killings had been successful in sapping morale.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian Nato's secretary-general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, responded to pressure for a faster withdrawal from Afghanistan by stating that the options were being studied and should be clear within three months.</p> <p>\"From now until the end of 2014 you may see adaptation of our presence. Our troops can redeploy, take on other tasks, or even withdraw, or we can reduce the number of foreign troops,\" he said. \"From now until the end of 2014 we will see announcements of redeployments, withdrawals or drawdown \u2026 If the security situation allows, I would not exclude the possibility that in certain areas you could accelerate the process.\"</p> <p>Rasmussen admitted that the killings of almost 50 allied troops this year in \"green on blue\" attacks \u2013 Afghan security forces turning on their trainers and mentors \u2013 had damaged the relationship between the international forces and the Afghan police and military.</p> <p>\"There's no doubt insider attacks have undermined trust and confidence, absolutely,\" he said.</p> <p>Nato aims to have an Afghan security force of 352,000 taking over responsibility for the country in just over two years when the US-led combat operations are scheduled to end.</p> <p>Amid argument among analysts as to what has been behind the stream of \"green on blue\" attacks, Nato officers on the ground are reported to have ascribed them mainly to disgruntled and embittered Afghan security forces with grudges against their western mentors.</p> <p>While Rasmussen conceded there may have been some such cases, Nato has clearly concluded from intelligence that the attacks have more to do with a Taliban strategy of infiltration of the Afghan security structures aimed at sowing distrust and confusion.</p> <p>\"It's safe to say that a significant part of the insider attacks are due to Taliban tactics \u2026 Probably it is part of a Taliban strategy,\" he said.</p> <p>While it was allied soldiers who were being killed, Rasmussen said the Taliban campaign's ultimate target was to turn western public opinion against the war.</p> <p>\"Political leaders in the capitals of troop-contributing countries know very well that this is part of a tactic or strategy to also undermine public and political support at home \u2026 The real target is politicians, media, opinion-formers at home in partner nations and allied nations.\"</p> <p>He added that some of the killings had been carried out by Taliban infiltrators disguised as Afghan police or soldiers.</p> <p>\"We have seen also where they were in Afghan uniforms though they are not members of the Afghan security force.\"</p> <p>On the pace and phasing of withdrawal \u2013 the difficult task of pulling out more than 120,000 troops from forbidding and frequently hostile terrain \u2013 Rasmussen said a key moment would come later this year when General John Allen, the US overall commander of the operations, delivered a report with his military recommendations.</p> <p>\"Political decisions will be taken based on his recommendations as to how we will adapt to the transfer of lead responsibility to the Afghans,\" he said. \"The pace will very much depend on the security situation on the ground.\"</p> <p>Rasmussen stressed that any accelerated rate of withdrawal should not be seen as \"a race for the exits\". The end of combat operations is to be followed from 2015 by a Nato-led training mission for the Afghan security forces, which will also require the continued deployment of fighting units or special forces, \u2013 \"enablers\" as they are called in military jargon.</p> <p>\"The core will be a training mission. Of course, we will have to ensure that our trainers can operate in a secure environment so we need capabilities to make sure that our trainers can operate,\" said the former Danish prime minister, who was appointed head of Nato in 2009.</p> <p>Additionally, there will be further US forces remaining in Afghanistan under a bilateral \"strategic partnership\" deal struck between Washington and Kabul.</p> <p>Amid mission creep fatigue across Europe, squeezed defence budgets and sweeping austerity cuts, it is not clear how many of the European Nato allies will contribute troops to the training mission. Defence ministers meet next week in Brussels to start planning the operations.</p>",
  "<p>There is a hair in my fish pie. \"Are you sure it's not yours?\" says Rachael, my dining companion. But it's not, and it's not one of the cat's either (I'm used to eating food with cat hair in it; it falls off my jumpers). It's baked into the mashed potato, sticking out like a neat little garnish. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother to complain, the idea of making a scene in a restaurant far more offputting to me than a mere stray hair, but the feeling that we're being watched \u2013 the restaurant is rigged with microphones and cameras that swivel towards us \u2013 forces me to confront it. They want me to, don't they?</p> <p>Until the hair incident, we had been enjoying our lunch at Hotel GB in south London, staffed by celebrities for a new Channel 4 show that begins tonight. I can see Gordon Ramsay in the kitchen at the back. The ma\u00eetre d, Phil Spencer from the property show Location, Location, Location, is on the other side of the restaurant taking someone's pudding order. I call him over. \"I don't want Gordon to be angry,\" I tell Spencer, who is already looking pink and flustered, \"but there's a hair in my pie.\"</p> <p>Later, when Ramsay comes over to apologise I tell him I hope nobody gets sacked for it. \"I'm not going to sack anyone because of a pube,\" he says. Actually, I don't think it was a pube. \"Was it curly?\" he demands, like an aggressive detective. Not really \u2013 it wasn't thick either. (How does pubic hair end up in food anyway? Are chefs trouserless behind the pass?) Ramsay, who is wearing trousers, looks a bit happier.</p> <p>I have spent the morning at Hotel GB \u2013 most of it, admittedly, in a bedroom waiting for the production team to finish filming before I'm allowed into parts of the hotel. Ramsay and the retail consultant Mary Portas are its co-general managers, with other famous Channel 4 people taking on tasks: Kim Woodburn is in charge of housekeeping, Gok Wan is working the bar, Katie Piper is the spa manager. They are in charge of 14 trainees \u2013 young unemployed people who have been given this chance to learn how to run a hotel, though quite what they are going to learn from celebrities who also don't know how to run a hotel I'm not sure. One of the trainees has already walked out.</p> <p>At 18, Manisha Sengupta is the youngest trainee and is working in the spa. We chat as she gives my nails a quick file. After finishing a hair-and-beauty course, she had been unemployed for two months when she was spotted by a Channel 4 researcher outside a job centre. \"It's so depressing being out of work. I was looking, looking, looking. I was so happy I got this opportunity. This shows opportunities can come up when you least expect it,\" she says. Is she nervous about being on TV? \"I keep forgetting about the cameras.\"</p> <p>Manisha's manager is Katie Piper, the former model and TV presenter whose efforts to overcome a horrific attack in 2008, in which acid was thrown in her face, has been followed in documentaries. \"It's nice for me to do something more lighthearted, so people can see me in a different way,\" says Piper. \"I like the competitive side as well [divided into men's and women's teams, the celebrities are competing to raise the most money for charity].\" As a teenager, Piper did a hair-and-beauty course at college and worked as an apprentice in a hotel spa, \"so I was in Manisha's position once, and it's lovely to come back and do it again\". She says all this while she washes and massages my feet. It's a faintly uncomfortable experience having someone you admire and respect do this for you (I resolve to leave a large tip).</p> <p>On the way to meet Dr Christian Jessen in the gym, where he will be offering guests \"health MOTs\", I peer through the door of the bar and see Woodburn, hair like an elaborate Christmas cake, cleaning tables. There is no sign of Gok Wan, the barman, or indeed anyone else. Is she being filmed, or does she just do this all the time wherever she goes? Nobody seems to know.</p> <p>Dr Christian is in the gym but not his trainee, Jess, a 20-year-old from Dagenham. \"She hasn't been able to hold down a job \u2013 she has got strong opinions of her own,\" he says. \"I said you've just got to hold down a job for long enough to get some funds in and then you can build up your own business and soon it will take off. She will be at her happiest when she's her own boss.\"</p> <p>I don't know what to ask Dr Christian, he of Embarrassing Bodies fame, being in possession of neither a third nipple nor a mouldy penis, and he only arrived 10 minutes ago and doesn't seem to really know what he's supposed to be doing here either. He says he will do things like measure guests' waists and warn them about cholesterol, and encourage them to do more exercise. He makes me try a hand-held weight, supposedly to firm up triceps, and shows how to move it up and down in a pumping action. I feel myself blushing. \"I call it a wank stick,\" says Dr Christian.</p> <p>I'm still not entirely sure what the point of the show is, beyond the chance to see \u2013 hopefully \u2013 Woodburn or Portas spar with Ramsay or see someone from Towie have a back, sack and crack wax in the salon. It is raising money for youth unemployment charities (the guests who have started checking in around the time I leave are all paying to stay, eat and drink here) and two of the trainees will get paid jobs with Ramsay and Portas at the end of the week, but it's mainly about instilling confidence, says Ramsay, who has three trainees in the kitchen. \"I'm amazed at how many young people are out of work,\" says Ramsay. \"This will give these people whatever it is they need to set them apart.\" If there is a serious point this show has unintentionally highlighted it's the idea that the reason a million 18- to 24-year-olds are unemployed is because of some sort of attitude problem, rather than a complicated mess of global economics and policy failures beyond their control.</p> <p>\"It's easy to be cynical,\" says Portas, who is watching as two of her trainees on reception are checking in an excited family. \"Oh, here we go, another reality show performing as if it's doing something for society. But I do think there is a role for people in the public eye to do more to help empower people and make a change.\" I've been impressed with all the trainees I've met so far and if it helps any of them get a job, then good for them.</p> <p>\"Look at her, isn't she great?\" says Portas, looking at Rory, a 22-year-old with tattoos and piercings who I had decided earlier was the friendliest and most welcoming person I have met in any hotel. Rory visibly swells with pride.</p> <p>\u2022 Hotel GB is on Channel 4 every night at 9pm until Friday</p>",

Referees make a successful return</h2> <p>I'm sure by now you've heard that the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/29/nlf-referees-lockout-eight-year-deal\">replacement referees have been shelved for at least another eight years</a> After the simultaneous-catch scandal in Seattle last Monday night, the NFL wasted little time in bringing back the regular referees by striking a new deal with the National Football League Referee Association. Now, I know that you all loved the replacement officials and will be feeling distraught at their loss, but don't worry: here at the Guardian they understand your pain and have supplanted the regulars \u2013 Paolo and Steve \u2013 with a scab writer, me, for this week... <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A4D8wJFCYAA04Al.jpg:large\">Start making your t-shirts now</a>.</p> <p>Don't worry, the regulars will be back next week.</p> <p>In all seriousness, the difference in watching football this weekend compared to the previous three Sundays was palpable. Gene Steratore's officiating crew set the standard on Thursday night with a quiet and quick performance in Baltimore. The Cleveland Browns lost out to the Ravens without an interception-touchdown or any head coach grabbing a man in stripes after the final whistle. There were certainly calls to infuriate the fans and plenty of contentious matters for the officials to sort through, but the overall standard of the officiating spiked significantly.</p> <p>No, the returning referees are not perfect, but they're not expected to be. Officiating in the NFL is carried out by humans with the aid of technology, not the other way around. There were plenty of bad calls and missed calls this weekend, but that is all a part of the drama of the NFL. That is, so long as it is held to an acceptable standard of enforcement from the officials. The contrast between this weekend's officiating and that of the previous three weeks assures fans that the NFL now has the best possible crews working the games.</p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>2. Only one team will make the playoffs from the AFC East</h2> <p>This season was expected to be the year when the Buffalo Bills returned to relevance, after revamping their much maligned defense in the offseason. That hype settled somewhat after a 48-28 loss on opening day, against the New York Jets, but victories over the Kansas City Chiefs and the Browns gave the Bills hope entering week four's monumental matchup with the New England Patriots.</p> <p>The 2-1 Bills welcomed the 1-2 Patriots to town in what was supposed to be a statement game for the home side. After offseason moves that saw <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7690355/buffalo-bills-agree-six-year-deal-mario-williams\">Mario Williams signed to a contract guaranteeing him $50m</a>, a changeover in scheme with a new defensive coordinator and the drafting of a superstar rookie cornerback, Stephon Gilmore, the Bills were hoping to improve on their 1-1 record with the Patriots from last year. Tom Brady, however, entered the game with an 18-2 record against the Bills.</p> <p>Brady threw four interceptions in Buffalo last year, so one could forgive the Bills for thinking they could disrupt the superstar quarterback with their shiny new defensive additions. Alas, as so often over the years, the Bills' expectation of victory was not met. Williams didn't register a sack \u2013 or get any consistent pressure \u2013 and the defense as a whole only registered one sack in total. Stephon Gilmore had a phenomenal day in shutting down Brandon Lloyd, but he dropped an interception in his own endzone and was overrun by Branden Bolden on a touchdown run.</p> <p>Despite playing with a 21-7 lead in the third quarter, the Bills lost 52-28. To give up 50 points in a game when the Patriots only had seven at the half, lost three fumbles, missed two field goals, were playing without two crucial offensive starters (Aaron Hernandez and Logan Mankins) and had lost two games in a row prior... the Bills simply cannot be considered a legitimate contender for the playoffs. Any team can have one bad day, but when you add this game to being blown out by the Jets and beating the Chiefs and Browns, there is very little to be optimistic about.</p> <p>The Patriots punished the Bills severely. Their 45-point half was the first since 1972. Brady threw for 340 yards and four touchdowns, while Wes Welker and Rob Gronkowski both had over 100 yards receiving. Stevan Ridley and Brandon Bolden both had over 100 yards rushing, a franchise first since 1980. Neither Bolden or Ridley turned into superstars overnight, but the Bills' porous play in the front seven gave them gaping holes to run through. The Patriots' domination was such that they managed a feat that had only ever been achieved once before. Only the Green Bay Packers, in 2008 against the Detroit Lions, had ever had two 100 yard rushers and two 100 yard receivers in one game.</p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>3. Rookie kickers are all the rage</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/may/24/2012-year-of-young-quarterback-nfl\">I wrote an article a while back expecting this year to be the year of the young quarterback</a>. Now while Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III and even Ryan Tannehill have all been very impressive considering their youth, they must concede, so far, to the kicking talent that has entered the league.</p> <p>Kickers are generally afterthoughts in the NFL, but only until your team has a terrible one do you really appreciate their value. Any fans who watched last season should respect a good kicker almost as much as a good referee. The San Francisco 49ers almost rode veteran David Akers to the Super Bowl, while another veteran, Billy Cundiff, missed the crucial kick to keep the Ravens out of the big game.</p> <p>This year, Cundiff has fallen to a talented rookie. There are three players making a major impact: the Baltimore Ravens' Justin Tucker, the Minnesota Vikings' Blair Walsh and the St Louis Rams' Greg Zuerlein. </p> <p>Tucker was an undrafted rookie out of Texas who beat out Cundiff in a kicking competition in the off-season, but the Rams and Vikings valued their kickers enough to draft them in the sixth round. The Vikings investment in Walsh immediately paid off as he kicked four field goals (and two extra points) in the Vikings' opening-week victory against Jacksonville: Walsh hit a 55-yard attempt to tie the game late before hitting the game-winning kick from 38 yards. </p> <p>Zuerlein has been a model of consistency, scoring 12 of his 12 attempts this year. This week Zuerlein matched the Rams' record with a 58-yard kick, before succeeding with a 60-yarder. Steven Jackson pretty much summed it up: <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000067740/article/greg-zuerlein-has-record-day-in-rams-1913-victory-over-seahawks\">\"Right now, our kicker is the MVP of the season.\"</a></p> <p>Oh, and Tucker? All he did was kick the game-winning field goal against the Patriots last week. You never know, he might have put the Ravens in the Super Bowl last year.</p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>4. Saints are 0-4, but improving</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396988652\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/1/1349112396915/New-Orleans-Saints-quarte-008.jpg\" alt=\"New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees pauses during a time out against the Green Bay Packers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees pauses during a time out against the Green Bay Packers. Photograph: Darren Hack/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Hack/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking of kickers, a missed field goal from Graham Hartley was the difference between the New Orleans Saints getting their first win of the season and falling to 0-4. Down by one with just under three minutes to go, Hartley missed from 48 yards. The Packers then ran out the clock. Despite the loss, there were definitely more promising signs for the Saints this week.</p> <p>After Sean Payton was suspended for the season, for his role in the Saints' bounty scandal, most expected Drew Brees' leadership to help alleviate the effect of his loss. That didn't prove true in the first three games of this season. The truth is that the Saints roster is set up to go as far as Brees can carry them. The NFL is a team game, but the Saints' defense has too many holes and the offense is completely dependent on the superstar quarterback.</p> <p>Brees had an amazing year in 2011, when he broke Dan Marino's record for passing yards in a season. He also threw 46 touchdowns, but maybe most impressive of all was his completion of more than 70%. Couple that with a measly 14 interceptions in 16 games and the Saints' offense was reaching its full potential. </p> <p>That was not the case in the first three games of this season. Against the Washington Redskins, the Carolina Panthers and the Chiefs, Brees completed only 54% and threw five interceptions.</p> <p>Because the Saints defense appears to be in an even worse condition than it was last year, Brees cannot afford to be putting up those numbers. Fortunately for Saints fans, when you have an elite quarterback, such struggles are generally shortlived. Brees rebounded with a 446-yard passing performance and three touchdowns with no interceptions. Even though the Packers defense isn't an intimidating prospect, the Saints' execution on offense was impressive.</p> <p>Brees threw the ball more than 50 times, but when you are paying your quarterback $40m for one season, asking him to carry the load every week shouldn't be a problem. <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/football/nfl/wires/09/30/2020.ap.fbn.saints.td.record.0125/index.html\">Brees tied Johnny Unitas's 47 game-streak with a passing touchdown</a>, and that should act as a kick start for the team's season as they look to sneak into the playoffs. The Atlanta Falcons will likely win the NFC South after starting the season 4-0, but only four teams in the NFC have three or more wins so the Saints aren't facing an insurmountable task.</p> <p>Drew Brees is an elite quarterback and he won't let his team go out without a fight to the finish.</p> <p><a href=\"#planned\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>5. Miami have potential superstar rookie QB No3</h2> <p>While Andrew Luck was resting his feet this week, Robert Griffin III was leading a comeback victory against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2013 a comeback victory that featured a game-winning kick from one Billy Cundiff, I might add.</p> <p>Griffin and Luck have made excellent starts to careers that began under more scrutiny than any in recent memory. The two of them are proving right all those draft experts who predicted they would be superstars, but as with any good draft there are also some picks who are making such analysts look like fools.</p> <p>Other than maybe Bruce Irvin, no pick in the 2012 draft received as much disapproval as the Miami Dolphins' selection of Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill was taken with the eighth overall pick in the draft. Despite being taken so high, there were plenty of reasons for fans to doubt the choice. Jeff Ireland has done Dolphins fans no favours in the past, so fans are hesitant to trust his judgment, but the fact that he drafted a quarterback who initially played wide receiver in college and who had previously worked with new offensive coordinator Mike Sherman, made fans skeptical of Tannehill's fit.</p> <p>Most analysts agreed with the fans as very few gave Tannehill a top-10 grade. Once Tannehill earned the starting job, however, after David Garrard's injury, he began to win over the fans. <a href=\"http://cianfaheycolumns.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/breaking-down-the-tape-of-ryan-tannehills-first-game-for-the-miami-dolphins/\">He showed off excellent accuracy, anticipation and athleticism in the preseason</a> before struggling to make an impact as the Dolphins started out 1-2. Tannehill couldn't prevent his team from falling to 1-3 this week, but he did begin to show flashes of what excited fans in the preseason.</p> <p>With Reggie Bush ailing and the Arizona Cardinals focusing on shutting down the running game, Joe Philbin put his offense on the shoulders of his young quarterback.<a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000067819/article/ryan-tannehill-brian-hartline-set-records-for-dolphins\"> Tannehill responded by setting a franchise record for a rookie, with 431 yards passing</a>. That surpassed Dan Marino's mark, from 1983, and is second only in NFL history to Cam Newton, who threw for 432 yards last season. Tannehill also helped Brian Hartline set a franchise record for receiving yards, with 253 yards on 12 receptions.</p> <p>In terms of passing, however, records are essentially redundant nowadays, because of how different the game is to when players like Marino played. Quarterbacks can put up phenomenal numbers because defenders are not allowed to be as physical with them or their receivers as they once were. EBut even though the rules have changed, the majority of the skills that a quarterback needs have not. It was those skills, more than the statistics, that really gave the Dolphins a glimpse of why Tannehill should one day be their franchise quarterback.</p> <p>Tannehill didn't flinch on going to Arizona to take on the league's top-ranked defense. Unlike most rookie quarterbacks in tough situtations, he wasn't hesitant early and he never shied away from making difficult throws. He read defenses quickly and found the right match-ups for his receivers while evading rushers with his athleticism and awareness in the pocket. </p> <p>Tannehill led three scoring drives that gave his team a 13-0 lead at the half. Even when things were looking bleak, and the Cardinals had come back to lead 14-13 early in the third quarter, Tannehill responded with an 80-yard touchdown pass to once again put his team in position to win the game.</p> <p>He would later lose a fumble and throw an interception, but those were caused by a combination of a phenomenal play from the Cardinals defense and a rookie mistake that Tannehill will learn from. </p> <p>Tannehill, like Luck and Griffin III, is a rookie quarterback who will continue to make rookie mistakes. However, just like Luck and Griffin III, he has superstar potential and is already showing it off.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/schedules\">NFL schedule and results</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/standings\">NFL standings</a></p>",

A great deal has changed in the Virginia town of Roanoke \u2013 a swing area in a swing state \u2013 since I spent three weeks there <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/29/younge.america.roanoke.virginia\">during the last presidential election</a>. Back then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/sep/30/roanoke\">I asked a black woman</a> if she thought Virginia would elect a black man to the presidency. She paused for five seconds. \"If they really know how things are now they would \u2026 They should,\" she said desperately trying to convince herself.</p> <p>They did. But back then Obama supporters dared not believe it even as they worked night and day to achieve it. The Obama campaign office <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">fizzed with excitement</a>, reviving the energy of those who had previously been disaffected with politics and drawing in new blood from people who had never been interested. People travelled hundreds of miles from all over the country to volunteer in the town.</p> <p>There were a range of reasons for this, not least that he would be the first black president and that his election signalled a departure from the war and the oligarchic impulses of the previous eight years.</p> <p>But the celebrations <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/what-obama-means-world\">went way beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains</a> in which Roanoke nestles. Throughout the Caribbean radios blared Mighty Sparrow's calypso hit Barack the Magnificent; firecrackers went off in El Salvador; Liberians danced in the street. In Ghana the late John Atta Mills ran for the presidency with posters of himself standing next to a life-size cutout of Obama and won. In Brazil, at least eight black candidates took advantage of a quirk in electoral laws so they could stand as \"Barack Obama\" in elections in October.</p> <p>This global outpouring was more than just a response against Bush (it's difficult to believe there would have been such an outpouring if John Kerry had won in 2004). At a time when electoral turnout was declining across most of the western world and disaffection with political classes was at its height, the energy invested in him in Roanoke and projected onto him from afar marked resurrection of the fundamental notion that elections could change things and, in so doing, reconnect popular will to political power through electoral politics.</p> <p>\"People have been excited by Obama's candidacy but also by working together,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">said Brian Corr</a>, who'd been volunteering between 10 and 15 hours a day from his home in Boston for more than 18 months. \"Organised people are more powerful than organised money \u2026 we need to make sure that all that hope that we have talked about and seen is channelled in a progressive way.\"</p> <p>Given the glaring flaws in American democracy, notably the influence of money and lobbyists, one can debate whether that sense of empowerment was well placed. Obama was not the head of a movement but a well co-ordinated campaign. Those involved had no ownership of it. When the election was over the offices in Roanoke closed and the staffers left, never to return again. But there was no doubt that people did feel empowered.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The most marked political change in the last four years is the degree to which those who were once politically engaged no longer have that sense of possibility. Every Obama supporter I met in 2008 was less involved now than they were then. Most were not involved at all. Many had their reasons, primarily work and children. All of them thought he was certain to win, which may have been a factor. And it would be difficult to replicate the excitement of that election. In the words of Sade: \"It's never as good as the first time.\"</p> <p>But underpinning it all was a general sense of ennui not with him in particular \u2013 they all still loved him \u2013 but with politics in general: a sense that there was little point in investing energy in a political class or much faith in the electoral process that produces them. \"I never thought things could become more divided, and there be more fighting,\" says Ann Trinkel, echoing the frustrations of many. \"But oh my gosh it's just \u2026 gridlock. And I guess that's what sort of lessened the hopefulness for me, and made me a bit more cynical, is all the money.\"</p> <p>It's not difficult to see why. The day I arrived in Roanoke in 2008 Congress voted against the bailout. It felt as though you could look out of your hotel window and see the nation's economy implode. Wachovia bank, the area's fourth largest employer whose name was emblazoned on top of the town's only skyscraper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/06/usa.useconomy\">had been laid low by bad debts</a> and was the subject of an emergency rescue. In 2008 one in eight families in Roanoke lived below the poverty line and the town's median income was three-quarters the national average. </p> <p>Today one in five live in poverty and income is 70% of the national average. In the year before Obama was inaugurated <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/197663\">unemployment there leapt</a> from 3.6% to 6.5%. <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/197663\">Today it is 6.4%</a>. The haemorrhaging has stopped but for many a slow death continues. True, it could be worse. But that was not the rally cry four years ago. Some of those who bought into the promise of change could be forgiven for demanding a refund.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Nationally, the overwhelming majority of Americans still believe the country is on the wrong track and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/dem-convention-charlotte/247263-hill-poll-voters-think-second-term-undeserved\">a narrow majority believe Obama does not deserve a second term</a>. In the four years between when he first declared his candidacy and the mid-terms in 2010 the median American family <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fed-americans-wealth-dropped-40-percent/2012/06/11/gJQAlIsCVV_story.html\">lost a generation of wealth</a>. Wages are stagnant, unemployment high, social mobility slowing, poor white women are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/us/life-expectancy-for-less-educated-whites-in-us-is-shrinking.html\">dying earlier than their mothers did</a> and the gap between black and white is growing. <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/winning-has-become-not-losing-20120927\">A recent poll revealed</a> that a slim majority of Americans define success as 'not falling behind'. </p> <p>\"They talk about the rich and the middle class \u2026 they never talk about poverty. We're living in total poverty. We have nothing right now,\" said Robin Barbour four years ago in Roanoke. Back then she was living with her partner Fred Crews in his mother's basement and volunteering for the Obama campaign. Since Obama's been president <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/jan/23/america.poverty\">poverty has increased around 14%</a> but he's not delivered a single speech on poverty and mentioned the word just three times in all his state of the union speeches.</p> <p>Few, even among his own supporters, believe Obama re-election will actually reverse these trends. They just think Romney will accelerate and exacerbate them. He is winning at present not because most people think he has done a great job (though many Obama supporters do) but because they think he's done <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\">the best job he could under the circumstances</a>. The trouble is it is precisely those circumstances \u2013 gridlock, big money, polarisation \u2013 that are turning them off and with the Republicans set to retake the House and possibly the Senate those circumstances are going to get worse.</p> <p>That's not to say that nothing has changed or that it makes no difference who wins. In Roanoke, Chelsea's son, Harrison, was born with two heart defects. Prior to Obama's healthcare reforms that could have meant a life of penury in which he could either be denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, had to pay exorbitant rates or faced a lifetime cap on the amount his insurance provider would pay to cover him. Such changes, along with his executive order to halt the deportation of thousands of young undocumented immigrants or the Lily Ledbetter Act, protecting equal pay for equal work, or the repeal of don't ask don't tell for gays in the military makes a crucial difference to many people's lives.</p> <p>So while one may argue that Obama's impact has been too incremental or insufficient, it is untenable to claim that he has made no impact and no difference. Both parties have framed the coming five weeks as a choice between two different visions of the country. There is some truth to that. But beyond the vague notion of 'more fairness' or 'less government' few could tell you what those visions are. The problem is that neither choice actually answers the central and enduring problems the country is facing. Like Seinfeld, this election campaigns have become a show about nothing.</p> <p>Meanwhile the electoral industrial complex keeps churning out polls and analysis as though on a split screen, making the contest not about who or what will or could change but just who will win, where and by how much. The horse race is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/uselections2008.usa \">seductive and not entirely avoidable</a>. </p> <p>But my aim is to report from the other screen: where people live, love, survive and \u2013 all too rarely at present \u2013 thrive. To move beyond and between the narrow lens of two parties, fuelled by gaffes and donors, to gauge what people thought would change, think of what has changed and what they would like to change. To see to what extent they think this election will make a difference to their lives and what, if anything, that tells them about the state of the country they live in.</p>",
  "<p>Only 14% of employees in the UK (compared with a 21% global average) are fully engaged in their work and one in four (24%) are not satisfied with their job, according to a <a href=\"http://www.towerswatson.com/research/7177\" title=\"\">Towers Watson global workforce survey</a>. Furthermore, nearly one in three (30%) do not feel engaged by their employer.</p> <p>This is no trivial matter. Gallup estimates the cost of employee disengagement to the UK economy to be somewhere between \u00a359.4bn and \u00a364.7bn. Part of this cost is sickness-related absence; engaged employees in the UK take an average of 2.7 sick days per year, compared with 6.2 for those who could be described as disengaged.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.centreformentalhealth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Centre for Mental Health</a> estimates that employers loose around \u00a38.4bn a year this way. However, nearly double this amount (\u00a315.1bn a year) is due to productivity loss from people not feeling well in the workplace, so-called presenteeism.</p> <p>Turn the trend around, however, and there are big upsides to having an engaged workforce. Research by the Corporate Leadership Council suggests that engaged employees are 87% less likely to leave their organisation. According to the IES/Work Foundation, if companies increased investment in workplace engagement by 10%, they would increase profits by \u00a31,500 per employee per year. That is because engaged employees generate 43% more revenue than disengaged ones and highly engaged organisations have the potential to reduce staff turnover by 87% and improve performance by 20%.</p> <p>Given these statistics, it is hardly surprising that issues of wellbeing in the workplace are on the rise. In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.bitc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Business in the Community</a> (BITC) promotes this agenda through their <a href=\"http://www.bitc.org.uk/workplace/health_and_wellbeing/index.html\" title=\"\">Workwell campaign</a>, while globally the <a href=\"http://www.greatplacetowork.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Great Place to Work Institute</a> partners with more than 5,500 organisations with around 10 million employees to conduct the largest annual set of workplace culture studies in the world.</p> <p>According to their research, employees believe they work for great organisations when they trust the people they work for, have&#xa0;pride in what they do and enjoy the people they work with.</p> <p>Great Place to Work's&#xa0;annual surveys and awards give kudos and some PR-driven reputational payback for companies that are investing in workplace wellbeing. For example, Microsoft topped the leader board in 2011 for the best multinational to work for globally, as well as in Europe.</p> <p>\"For us that means greater creativity, greater productivity and, ultimately, continued success as a market leader,\" says Michel Van der Bel, managing director for Microsoft UK says. Kimberly Clark scored top in Latin America and the Admiral Group leads in the UK. Importantly, Great Place to Work also recognises large national companies and small and medium-sized enterprises.</p> <p>Awards are one way to recognise best practice. Another is certification of management systems, which tends to encourage greater embedding of the values in the organisation. One place where this is happening is Slovenia, where the Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs, in partnership with auditing firm <a href=\"http://www.ekvilib.org/en\" title=\"\">The Ekvilib Institute</a>, has run a family friendly enterprise certification scheme since 2007. To date, more than 130 companies, employing around 50,000 workers (7% of Slovenian workforce) have been certified. The certification scheme is based on the European family audit system developed by the German organisation Berufundfamilie and currently used in Germany, Austria, Hungary and Italy.</p> <p>In Slovenia, the certification focuses on employer practices that support work-life balance, especially creating a work environment that supports women with young children that do not want to make a trade-off between career aspirations and family commitments.</p> <p>For example, employees with children are given flexible working hours and additional leave days, various stress relief programmes are offered, and a special team is established to introduce better methods of work which co-ordinate professional and family life, including services like counselling, child care, babysitters, vacation offers and spaces for children in the company.</p> <p>Some leading role models in these practises in Slovenia include Dejan Turk, the relatively young chief executive of Si.mobil, the country's second biggest mobile operator, as well as Matjaz Cadez, founder and former chief executive of the IT company Halcom, and the Ursic brothers, who own a small manufacturing company called IMAS.</p> <p>But family friendly enterprise goes beyond the good reputations of a few. The results across all the Slovenian certified companies are impressive. Research shows that these businesses benefit commercially in a number of other ways, in particular they achieve a reduction in staff turnover and sick leave, along with higher employee productivity, motivation, satisfaction and commitment.</p> <p>Apart from these quantifiable business case benefits, family friendly enterprise is also about a shift in leadership perceptions and organisational culture. According to Ales Kranjc Kuslan, director of Ekvilib Institute, in their certified companies, \"top management start to think of employees as partners and a long term investment, rather than just another cost.\"</p> <p>Petra Hartman, project officer at Ekvilib Institute, believes this is even more critical in a recessionary environment. \"In times of economic crisis, companies will have to be creative in rewarding their employees in non-financial ways.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>And what better way than by creating a work environment that supports not only you and your job, but also your family and your quality of life.</p> <p><em>Wayne Visser is director of Kaleidoscope Futures and senior associate at the </em><a href=\"http://www.cpsl.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership</em></a><em>.

  "<p>US manufacturing activity expanded in September after shrinking for three consecutive months, according to a nationwide poll from the Institute for Supply Management.</p> <p>The results of <a href=\"http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm?navItemNumber=12942\">ISM's closely watched monthly survey</a> were far better than economists had been expecting, with most predicting another month of contraction. The purchasing managers index (PMI), which reflects the acquisition of goods and services, was 51.5 in September \u2013 any figure above 50 represents growth. It stood at 49.6 in August.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said the report was \"unquestionably positive\". US stocks markets rose on the news.</p> <p>The numbers come amid mixed signals about the fragile recovery in the US economy. Last week the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/27/us-gdp-growth-estimate-revised-down\">US downgraded its economic forecasts</a> for growth in the second quarter. But there were signs that the housing market is finally on the mend. Ahead of ISM's latest release economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast PMI would come in at 49.5.</p> <p>In a note to clients, Greenhaus wrote: \"Along with a number of other indicators, the recent weakening of the ISM manufacturing index has led several clients to inquire as to whether the US was falling into recession. Today's number dampens that question for sure but may not squash it altogether.\"</p> <p>Of the 18 manufacturing industries surveyed, 11 reported growth in September, including textile mills, food and beverages, apparel, paper products, petroleum and coal. Six industries reported contraction in September including transportation equipment. Last week the commerce department reported a 13.2% drop in durable goods orders in September, the largest fall since January 2009, driven down largely by falling orders for civil aircraft.</p> <p>The ISM report contains quotes from executives across a range of industries that appear once more to underline the mixed picture of the economy. \"[It] appears that our so-called 'slowdown' was a summer thing. September brings with it increasing requirements and business,\" said an executive in the paper products industry. \"Sales have tanked over the last two months, bringing a very concerned and stressed management team. Not very optimistic for the near-term future,\" said an executive in apparel, leather and allied products.</p> <p>The ISM figures come days before president Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney clash in their first debate, a face-off that is expected to focus on the state of the US economy. On Friday the bureau of labor statistics will release its latest non-farm payroll figures, a monthly snapshot of the US jobs market that has become a electoral flashpoint in the 2012 campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Here's how the majority of design projects work. A client writes a brief, clearly laying out a set of requirements for the project they are commissioning. This brief can contain: customer needs and profile, technical specifications, budgets and manufacturing recommendations, in other words all the essential ingredients of a successful design.</p> <p>The brief provides the rules to work to and then a checklist to measure your designs against at the end. The designer's job is to balance these technical, commercial, brand and customer parameters. You can exceed the brief, but certainly never under deliver. So if this is the all-powerful blueprint for successful design, why not embed sustainability in it to ensure it happens systematically?</p> <p>Here lies the first challenge of sustainable design - getting sustainability into the design process, so it is part of the normal way we design, whether through briefing or some other mechanism. The good news is that, in our experience, sustainability is now visible in client briefs. The bad news? It's not in all briefs and as of yet, is not a default consideration in design. <a href=\"http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-work/insight/research/design-industry-research-2010/\" title=\"\">Just 14% of designers say</a> that green issues were an important factor in them winning or delivering work for clients.</p> <p><strong>Sustainability is just good design</strong></p> <p>'Good design is sustainable design' announced the UK Design Council's strategic plan in 2008, but I believe we must go one step further, not only making sustainability part of good design, but of all design. Mike Barry from Marks &amp; Spencer echoes this in setting a target to get sustainability inside every product the retailer sells.</p> <p>My <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/sustainability-sustainable-design-products?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">previous article</a> explained how designers shape the next generation of products and services that are critical to the sustainability of the UK economy. Factoring social and environmental considerations into the design of future products can ensure we hit our long-term targets for carbon emissions, resource efficiency, waste reduction, and reduced toxicity. Historically we've targeted specific sustainable products within a portfolio (an eco-range), or <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/\" title=\"\">high impact products</a>. This only spotlights a contradiction in a company's portfolio; why design sustainable products next to unsustainable counterparts? There are also cases of the risk impacts reduced in one product category being cancelled out by spiraling impacts in another.</p> <p><strong>100% of designs must encompass sustainability</strong></p> <p>One example of a sustainable design is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/sustainable-product-design-in-pictures?intcmp=239#/?picture=396261008&amp;index=6\" title=\"\">Bimbo packaging</a>, primarily designed for the user benefit of eliminating the ineffective packaging tie, which also has environmental benefits. Another is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/gallery/sustainable-product-design-in-pictures?intcmp=239#/?picture=396261020&amp;index=3\" title=\"\">Replenish</a>, the household cleaning refill that saves you money and reduces the inconvenience of running out.</p> <p>If sustainability in all design is the goal, then the client-designer relationship will be crucial to delivering this. Here are three ways to make sustainability a default in design:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Design briefs</strong></p> <p>Getting the briefing process right is an obvious first step. We've seen sustainability written into briefs in such unspecific ways that it will be of little use. This risks it being sidelined or dropped off the priority list. The more specific clients are in briefing, the better the results will be.</p> <p>Many advocate<a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/\" title=\"\"> lifecycle assessment</a> (LCA) or other product footprinting as an essential or mandatory part of design, which companies such as Levis, Danone or Kraft reportedly do. While in principle this may be effective, a broader set of sustainable design tools may be needed.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 In design processes</strong></p> <p>Individual products or projects are usually part of a strategic portfolio, which is carefully managed and can be another point of influence. Companies such as DSM, which aims for 80% of pipeline from sustainable product by 2015, and IKEA, with its goal of 90% eco-improved products by 2015, are building sustainability systematically into design. If targets are set to move the portfolio towards sustainability, the projects and products will follow.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Through design persuasion or stealth</strong></p> <p>Designers cannot control briefs or what clients do, but they can influence. That kind of creative disruption is often why clients turn to designers \u2013 because they think differently, stretching the client and the brief beyond what they see today. Why not do this on sustainability, either through persuasion or stealth?</p> <p>Given that the dynamics of power resting with clients, industry programmes and design standards can help, such as WRAP's excellent <a href=\"http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/economy/products-consumers/\" title=\"\">Product Sustainability Forum</a>, looking to unify the way we design products across different industries.</p> <p><strong>Next generation design</strong></p> <p>All this may sound like good housekeeping, rather than the imaginative, creative, inspirational processes normally associated with design. But even if its not glamorous, it can certainly be effective. In future, doing design without sustainability being, at the very least, a consideration in the brief or process, will be as inexcusable as designing dangerous or unsafe products is today.</p> <p>Avoiding sustainable design considerations now could also mean building-in future environmental or social risks for the very clients that designers are serving, or even for the next generation of users. That really would be 'off-brief' and the exact opposite of the added value service that clients have come to expect from good design.</p> <p><em>Chris Sherwin is head of sustainability at design and innovation company </em><a href=\"http://www.seymourpowell.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Seymourpowell</em></a><em>.

  "<p>A fascinating weekend for several reasons delivered a resounding response to the recent slump as the top 12 movies grossed roughly 20% more than the corresponding weekend in 2011. It was a thunderous session for Sony as both Hotel Transylvania and <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Looper</a> completed a one-two at the top. Hotel Transylvania is a homegrown Sony movie that overtook the $35.6m opening weekend of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142926/smurfs\" title=\"\">The Smurfs</a> in summer 2011 to pull off the biggest ever debut for a Sony Pictures Animation title. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/adamsandler\" title=\"\">Adam Sandler</a> and his pal Kevin James (of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142848/zookeeper\" title=\"\">Zookeeper</a> and the upcoming Here Comes the Boom) are among the voice actors on Hotel Transylvania and with a launch like this the studio can look forward to a final score north of $100m. Russian-born animation veteran Genndy Tartakovsky directed.</p> <p>The silver medal went to Looper and this is a far more interesting story. Rian Johnson directed the terrific sci-fi thriller starring his long-time collaborator Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It's a great role for Gordon-Levitt, and finally gives the young star of indie hit <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">(500) Days of Summer</a> a chance to break out into the multiplexes as a leading man in his own right after solid support work in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135706/inception\" title=\"\">Inception</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>.</p> <p>More importantly, Looper is a product of the independent space that appears to have the legs to stick around for a while. It was financed by Endgame Entertainment, who brought Chinese distributor DMG Entertainment on board as a co-financier. FilmDistrict picked up US distribution rights and released it through Sony's TriStar label.

  "<p>In the 1990s, the Pet Shop Boys <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfGTm_viXPs\" title=\"\">urged everyone to go west</a>, but these days, for UK international law firms, the opposite direction of travel is more attractive.</p> <p>The increased globalisation of trade and state of the world economy means UK law firms are going east in search of clients and revenue.</p> <p>On Monday, Herbert Smith, or Herbies as the city law firm is affectionately known, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/herbert-smith-in-tieup-to-form-new-legal-giant-8191539.html\" title=\"\">merges with Australian firm Freehills</a>. Herbert Smith Freehills comprises 20 worldwide offices with 2,800 lawyers. The union will form the eighth largest law firm in the world and the largest law firm in Asia Pacific \u2014 one of the fastest growing legal markets in the world.</p> <p>So, if you see yourself working on multi-jurisdictional corporate deals, energy projects or international arbitrations in the region how might you persuade firms such as Herbert Smith Freehills that you're the right person for the job? \"As well as being an absolutely first rate lawyer, you need a sort of cultural affinity. You've got to enjoy working with people from different cultural backgrounds,\" says David Willis, managing partner at the firm.</p> <p>Applicants with international backgrounds who have lived in the region and have knowledge of the cultures and languages, and who have been educated to the same standard as students in the UK will, naturally, be attractive to the firm says Willis. But that does not rule out home grown students who do not have that background. What you do need, he suggests, is an international outlook.</p> <p>There's no two ways about it, you will face stiff competition if you want to work at a world-class law firm. Herbert Smith received more than 2,000 applications for the 70 \u2014 80 training contracts it offered in previous years.</p> <p>It is essential to shine, both academically and through extra-curricular activities. The firm says that whether you attended a state school or were privately educated should not matter, provided that you get the right grades, though it has no data on the educational background of its current trainees. Herbies requires a minimum of AAB at A-level for application to its vacation placements or for a training contract, and most candidates have straight As.</p> <p>The firm demands at least a 2:1 degree, but whether that is in law or in another subject does not matter. Generally around two thirds of those looking to become lawyers have a law degree, while the other third have studied another subject. \"I wouldn't know whether a lawyer working for me has done a law degree or something else and I don't really mind, provided it is a rigorous degree that teaches analytical skills,\" says Willis. What is important, he says, is that students have developed the ability to \"take great mounds of material and distil it down to coherent principles.\"</p> <p>If you haven't studied languages, it will not jeopardise your chances but, suggests Willis, applicants will have to demonstrate and show tangible evidence that they are internationally minded. What you have done with any gap year will be of interest.</p> <p>Willis is keen to point out that while the firm demands the highest academic standards, that does not mean that students must have attended Oxbridge: it recruits from a range of universities, although 36% of its 158 current trainees are Oxbridge graduates.</p> <p>To show what it would be like to be a trainee at the firm, Herbert Smith offers vacation schemes at its London and other international offices. Done in the penultimate or final year at university, or after graduation, students sit with a partner or associate and are given work to do for clients, as well as taking part in workshops and presentations and attending social events. Vacation students are paid \u00a3350 a week.</p> <p>Applications are open for the winter scheme from 1 \u2013 31 October and for the summer schemes from 1 December \u2013 15 January. If you spent your gap year in east Asia, you could consider applying to do a vacation placement at the firm's Hong Kong office.</p> <p>Those who have not done studied law at undergraduate level must undertake the year long graduate diploma in law. The next stage on the journey to becoming a lawyer, for all students, is the legal practice course (LPC). Herbert Smith took the decision to move away from the generic LPC and, with four other leading City firms, created a bespoke course designed to prepare for life in a city law firm.</p> <p>Run by BPP Law School, the course focuses on learning how to handle corporate and finance transactions, real estate transactions, and commercial dispute resolution matters \u2013 the firm's core practice areas. Willis accepts that the move may be seen as elitist, but defends the firm's position:</p> <blockquote> \"The trouble is that if you go to law school and you're trained how to do family law, conveyancing and criminal law, we don't do those things. We need to focus on civil litigation and company law, on business law.\" </blockquote> <p>The selection process for those elusive training contracts is rigorous. Candidates are put through a situational judgment test, a verbal and logical reasoning test, and an assessment day during which they undertake a range of exercises.</p> <p>In common with many large firms, the split between the number of male and female trainees is almost even \u2013 45% of the current cohort are men and 55% are women. But that shifts as careers progress. By associate level, the ratio is 48% male to 52% female. By partnership level the ration is distorted, with 83% male and only 17% female.</p> <p>During the training contract, which is split into four six-month slots, most recruits spend time working in-house with a client or in an international office. Willis recommends that anyone looking to work in Asia Pacific should get out to one of the region's offices during their training contract.</p> <p>After that, he advises junior lawyers to be open-minded about where their career takes them. When it comes to promotion criteria, he says working overseas will not harm your chances. In fact the position is quite the reverse. There is by and large an expectation that lawyers will have worked in more than one of the firm's international offices. Willis says: \"If you haven't, the question will be asked, why not.\"</p> <p>Prospective students often ask about the opportunity to do pro bono, or voluntary work. Partners and staff at Herbert Smith are encouraged to do 24 hours of pro bono work a year, which includes getting involved in volunteering at <a href=\"http://www.lawworksclinics.org.uk/whitechapel/index.php\" title=\"\">Whitechapel Legal Advice Centre</a> or the Royal Courts of Justice Citizens Advice Bureau, and advocacy through the <a href=\"http://www.thefru.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Free Representation Unit</a>, as well as support for work on behalf of people on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/06/global-fight-end-capital-punishment\" title=\"\">death row in the Caribbean</a>.</p> <p>The pay isn't too shoddy either: first year trainees receive \u00a338,000, which rises to \u00a361,500 for newly qualified lawyers - and at the other end of the scale equity partners can earn in the region of a million pounds a year.</p>",
  "<p>In the foothills of Hampstead Heath, where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels used to take their afternoon strolls, stands the home of Eric and Marlene Hobsbawm. To enter the Nassington Road drawing room for a conversation with Hobsbawm was to be transported back to the great ideological struggles of the extreme 20th century. Here was where ideas mattered, history had a purpose, and politics was important. And one could have no more generous, humane, rigorous, and involved a guide than the late Eric Hobsbawm.</p> <p>The breadth of his work and the reach of his intellect was always startling. Right to the end of his days, he stayed up to date with scholarship, never failed to flay an opponent, and continued to write. Afternoon tea with Hobsbawm could range from the achievements of President Lula of Brazil to the limitations of Isaiah Berlin as an historian, the unfortunate collapse of the Communist party in West Bengal to what Ralph Miliband would have made of his boys, David and Ed.</p> <p>But his lifetime's achievement was to transform the study of history in Britain. He was part of a postwar generation that rescued the subject from parochialism and dry-as-dust empiricism to shed new light on the past \u2013 from the history of social protest to the invention of tradition and the impact of jazz.</p> <p>For Hobsbawm, history had to be part of the conversation of the present. He fitted well into the English historical tradition of writing popular history books for an educated public. He was part of the practice of historical writing stretching back to Thomas Babington Macaulay and GM Trevelyan, alongside his peers AJP Taylor and Hugh Trevor-Roper. His 19th-century series on industry and empire and his bestselling account of the 20th-century provided the kind of global history for a broad readership few scholars have been able to match.</p> <p>His most important contribution was to open up the study of class and economy within the British academy. His membership of the Communist party historians group and his involvement with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_School\" title=\"\">French Annales school of historians</a> led him to emphasise the role of social history and structure in any comprehensive account of the past. Social history, for Hobsbawm, had to be part of the broader political project of the left \u2013 bringing to life lost voices and placing the lived reality of the people centre stage. But Hobsbawm was never a crass materialist \u2013 he always believed in the importance of the history of ideas. None more so than Marxism.</p> <p>Hobsbawm was one of Marxism's finest scholars. On day one, week one of any course I teach on Marxism, I give the students Hobsbawm to read. He explained its intellectual origins, historical function and 20th-century failings like few others. Of course, he was a believer \u2013 writing at the end of his life that \"the supersession of capitalism still sounds plausible to me\". And the recent crisis of capitalism only gave his ideological commitment more fervency. As he told me in one of his final interviews, \"a different combination, a different mix of state action and control and freedom would have to be worked out&#xa0;\u2026 It may well no longer be capitalism, certainly not in the sense in which we have known it in this country and the United States\".</p> <p>When it came to his own continued membership of the Communist party after the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary, Hobsbawm refused to play the apologist game. As a historian, he demanded to be understood in his own context \u2013 someone whose political identity was forged in the 1930s when the struggle against fascism took place on the streets of Vienna and the Communists were on the right side of history. He never sought, as he put it, \"agreement, approval or sympathy\". It was part of who he was and that was that.</p> <p>If all of this makes him sound a dour, Marxist professor then it could not be further from the truth. He loved to talk politics and academic wrangling over a vodka and tonic; he enjoyed a good book launch; he was an adept performer at history festivals (after a nip of whisky); and revelled in his large and adoring family.</p> <p>I last saw Hobsbawm at a lunch organised for himself and Hugh Thomas, the great scholar of Spain, at the House of Commons. There he expressed his great affection for Britain for adopting him in the 1930s, reflected with brio on the general correctness of his lifetime's historical work, and affirmed his conviction in a \"proper\" understanding of the past. Over coffee, Ed Miliband came to pay his regards and in the mix of history and politics, an appreciation of the past in the actions of the present, there was an affirmation of Hobsbawm's work.</p> <p>But, Hobsbawm being Hobsbawm, he immediately complained that Ed wasn't being nearly radical enough. There was always more work to be done, more criticism needed, more understanding shared. Hobsbawm was an Enlightenment giant whose passing marks a sad pulling away from the 20th century and all it entailed.</p> <p>\u2022 Tristram Hunt is the Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central.

  "<p>Hundreds of failed asylum seekers are living in Scotland on less than the UN's global poverty target of 77 pence ($1.25) a day.</p> <p>Pregnant women, children and people with disabilities are among those who have been left destitute on Scotland's streets, according to a <a href=\"http://www.stopdestitution.org.uk/files/Trapped%20destitution%20and%20asylum%20final.pdf\" title=\"\">report by the Scottish Poverty Information Unit (pdf)</a> which is based at Glasgow Caledonian University. The UN benchmark is aimed primarily at raising incomes in developing countries.</p> <p>The report's author, Morag Gillespie of SPIU, said the levels of poverty she found were \"dreadful\" and that many interviewees were literally penniless with no legitimate means of income.</p> <p>She said: \"I am an experienced researcher in the field of poverty but I was shocked at the scale of the problem and the accounts I heard: people literally trying to work out where the next meal would come from; a person forced to sleep in a church cupboard. This is a hidden crisis. I was upset at what I found and as a UK citizen I am affronted that the government allows this to happen.\"</p> <p>The report states that 1,849 destitute people were given emergency grants from a charity called the Refugee Survival Trust from 2009 to 2012.</p> <p>The recipients were mostly male (76%) but included 128 families with children, 21 pregnant women and 25 new mothers.</p> <p>Almost half (49%) were homeless, including families with children, 26 people with mental health issues, four disabled people and five pregnant women and two new mothers. The asylum seekers came from 67 countries, most often Iran, Iraq and Eritrea. Some interviewees had been in the asylum system for more than a decade.</p> <p>The independent study was commissioned by the British Red Cross, Refugee Survival Trust and the Scottish Refugee Council.</p> <p>SPIU recommends urgent changes to the asylum system, including support for pregnant women and measures to help the homeless and organisations supporting them.</p> <p>The report says the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) should allow asylum claims to be submitted in Scotland and that \"end-to-end support\" \u2013 including accommodation and a system of cash payments \u2013 should be given to people through all stages of the asylum system until they are either granted status or leave the UK. The report also called for asylum seekers to be given the right to work if they remain in the UK for six months or more.</p> <p>Gary Christie, of the Scottish Refugee Council, said: \"Every day our case workers deal with people who are in desperate situations. We see people who have been tortured in Iran yet have been refused protection; others fleeing for their lives from the violence of war in Somalia but who don't meet the terms of the refugee convention or pregnant women whose cases have been turned down and don't qualify for any support until they reach 32 weeks. While families are supposed to receive support until they leave or are granted status, our research shows that, terrifyingly, some are falling through the gaps. The system is complex, difficult to understand and is not working.\"</p> <p>A UK Border Agency spokesperson said: \"Failed asylum seekers need not face destitution if they simply comply with the law and the decisions of our courts and go home. There are routes of return home for all the nationalities once their asylum claims have been refused and the courts have confirmed that they have no need for protection and no legal right to stay in the UK.</p> <p>\"Assisted Return schemes exist to help failed asylum seekers return home with support to help them re-integrate. Further help and advice on Return programmes can be readily obtained from the charity Refugee Action, [&#xa0;\u2026which] work[s] in partnership with the UK Border Agency to help such individuals return home.\"</p> <h2>Case study: Michael</h2> <p>A businessman from Zimbabwe, Michael had his own successful import/export business. His cousin was the chairman of the local Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) branch, at the time, the only political party in opposition to Mugabe's government. While in the UK on business Michael received a phonecall from his secretary. The office had been ransacked and his life was under threat. She told him he could never come back. His claim for asylum in the UK, however, was refused and he has been destitute for almost two years.</p> <p>After his case was refused, Michael stayed with friends \u2013 sleeping on people's sofas. Over the last few months, however, Michael has been unable to stay at his friend's any longer and has been sleeping on the floor of a church hall, which operates as an emergency night shelter.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to sleep there. There are no showers, and the food is not always good.\"</p> <p>He worries about the fact that it is what supermarkets are throwing away \u2013 often food that has gone off. He gets his clothes from charity shops but is always looking out for things people are finished with. He tries to look good to maintain his self respect and to keep his esteem up.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Why did you decide to start an environmental project?</strong></h2> <p>I have always had an interest in sustainability and eco-design as a design and technology teacher and was looking for something whole school to work on. As head of creative arts and technology, I thought that I should be encouraging students to get involved with a big project that would also help them develop leadership skills to help them have the opportunity to achieve leadership qualifications through a school based reward programme.</p> <h2><strong>How have the students got involved?</strong></h2> <p>I decided to ask students to volunteer to be part of the school's eco-committee and after putting up posters and getting messages out in assemblies and tutor time I had a small group of interested pupils from year 7 to year 12.</p> <p>One of the main events that we ran was the Switch Off Fortnight last November when everyone was encouraged to switch off machines rather than leave them on stand-by. The feedback was that a number of students and staff had changed the habits of leaving equipment such as computers, laptops and lights on stand-by in school.</p> <h2><strong>What kind of things have you been doing?</strong></h2> <p>Once the committee was formed we focused on initiatives like Switch Off Fortnight and Waste Week to get us started. As we move on to action planning for our <a href=\"http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/ecoschools/applyforanaward/silveraward\">silver award</a> - as part of the <a href=\"http://keepbritaintidy.org/EcoSchools?gclid=CN_73MXG6bICFUXHtAodVE8A4w\">Eco Schools</a> initiative - from the students decided that the areas we would focus on would be energy, school grounds, waste and global citizenship.</p> <p>The committee has two students from each year group and the action plan identified which students were responsible to lead on which areas. This helped me to manage the workload of the project and made sure that the students were running it alongside me.</p> <p>We have looked at energy monitoring and compared the impact of Switch Off Fortnight to other times in the year. We also took part in an <a href=\"http://www.etwinning.net/en/pub/index.htm\">eTwinning</a> project with 10 other European countries and focused on climate change. Students produced documents and presentations and uploaded resources to share with the schools in the cluster.</p> <p>Our waste officers have started looking at increasing the materials recycled in school and set up a waste team to make sure bins are labelled correctly and emptied regularly. Students ran assemblies, designed publicity materials to be shown on PC background screens around school and discussed waste and recycling with other students around school. The waste officers now have a recycling team who collect the paper recycling for the whole of school every week.</p> <p>We have also worked with the local community to plant trees and look at our own school grounds.</p> <p>Now, we have just started work on our action plan for the Green Flag Award and I want to encourage the student committee to run more independently this year. In our first meeting we voted for a chair and vice-chair who I will support to start with to run the meeting and organise the activities planned. I hope the two sixth form students who have taken on this extra responsibility will benefit from the skills gained to help them when they are applying for university or employment during the next year.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>What has it taught you as a teacher?</strong></h2> <p>I've been extremely proud of the students of how hard they have worked and how reliable and organised they can be when given the opportunity. Projects like this, when the students run them, show you just how well they can work independently and maturely. In my teaching I try to encourage resilience and independence and this has just reinforced my beliefs in how important it can be to give students a whole range of experiences and opportunities for responsibilities to let them show what they are made of.</p> <h2><strong>What advice would you offer any other school embarking on a similar route?</strong></h2> <p>I would recommend making sure your students run any project with you. There is a lot of work and it is important that students do the majority. Make it fun for them as well as you, but make meetings professional so they realise how important it is. Students like badges - our waste officers wear their badges with pride and we have a colours reward system at Arden and to thank them for the commitment they all were awarded a half colour in the end of year awards ceremony to sew on to their blazer and show off to everyone.</p> <p><em>Liz Allton is the head of creative arts and technology at <a href=\"http://www.arden.solihull.sch.uk/ad/home/\">Arden Academy</a>, Solihull.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>The death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/eric-hobsbawm\" title=\"\">Eric Hobsbawm</a> at the age of 95 leaves us bereft of a great historian, a masterly writer of muscular readable prose, and a scholar whose intellectual curiosity and range had few if any equals. He was already well past retirement age when I came to know him \u2013 first at Birkbeck College, the old workingmen's college in whose ideals he always took enormous pride, and then at meetings of <a href=\"http://past.oxfordjournals.org/\" title=\"\">Past and Present</a>, the journal he had helped found. But despite being well on the wrong side of 80, he was still very active.</p> <p>He had taught at Birkbeck since the late 1940s, and as he kept a small office at Birkbeck 50 years on, I think it was in the narrow corridor outside it that I first saw him, lean, slightly stooping. The already frail shoulders under the sportsjacket made one feel protective of him but that feeling disappeared as soon as he began to talk. Hobsbawm needed no protection, and his mind retained a quite extraordinary energy and clarity up to the very end. And then there was his voice \u2013 crisp, almost military, the characteristic barked interrogative \u2013 \"Not really a first-class mind, what?\" \u2013 that summoned up a vanished mid-century Britain that was as much a part of Hobsbawm as the endlessly commented on Marxism.</p> <p>Certainly, it is hard to think of another Marxist who more richly deserved the Companion of Honour bestowed on him in 1998, for what Hobsbawm gave this country was more than it gave him. He had arrived as a schoolboy in 1933, having spent most of his life till then in Vienna and Berlin (a story he would recount in his wonderful autobiography <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\"><em>Interesting Times</em></a>), where he had already witnessed the rise of the Nazis and discovered Karl Marx. At Cambridge, where he studied in the 30s, he had a reputation for omniscience. Running the local Communist party cell from the set of college rooms beneath Wittgenstein's, the youthful Hobsbawm was invited to join the exclusive Apostles society. His was the anti-fascist generation, and once he had made his political choice, he stuck with it his entire life and never apologised for it.</p> <p>Looking for a job once the war was over, he was hamstrung by his party affiliation; a mild McCarthyism hung in the air even in England. Cambridge turned its back on him, but Birkbeck welcomed him in. Above the Garibaldi restaurant in Saffron Hill, he was a member of an extraordinary club \u2013 the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_Historians_Group\" title=\"\">Communist Party Historians Group</a>. If today British historians are among the most outward-looking sections of the academy, that is in large part due to the work of the CPHG. After 1946, its members helped transform what had been a crusty coterie of constitutionalists and kings-and-queens types, popularising the study of ordinary people, and putting social and economic history at the centre of the profession.</p> <p>The journal Past and Present was a breath of fresh air, and a conduit for new ideas from abroad. The parochialism of English intellectual life started to lift. That Marxism was the intellectual generator of this revolution was, as Marxists once liked to say, no accident. It provided a natural bridge to other social sciences \u2013 notably sociology and economics \u2013 where exciting things were happening, and while it made England, home of the industrial revolution, the centre of historical action, at the same time it inculcated a global view.</p> <p>Hobsbawm was at the heart of this. Even as he was pursuing his other passion, jazz \u2013 about which he wrote superbly well under the pseudonym Francis Newton \u2013 he was forging contacts with French, German and Italian historians, and allowing their ideas and interests to shape his own. The historian who had cut his teeth on the history of the Fabian movement began to write about Italian peasants and South American bandits. And then he embarked on the extraordinary quartet of books which still provide a compelling and unparallelled introduction for thousands of readers to world history from the French revolution to the end of the 20th century (<em>The Age of Revolution</em>, <em>The Age of Capital</em>, <em>The Age of Empire</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780349106717/the-age-of-extremes-the-short-twentieth-century\" title=\"\"><em>The Age of Extremes</em></a>).</p> <p>Rereading those books it is hard not to be overwhelmed by Hobsbawm's skill. One of the hardest things for a historian is to make an argument readable; he does it better than anyone. Not for Hobsbawm, the turn to narrative, the urge to tell stories. He had plenty of his own. But his histories are about trends, social forces, large-scale change over vast distances. Telling that kind of history in a way that is as compelling as a detective story is a real challenge of style and composition: in the tetralogy, Hobsbawm shows how to do it.</p> <p>To be sure, some bits work better than others. <em>Age of Empire</em> remains a tour de force; no other Europeanist was at home writing about South America one minute and China the next. <em>Age of Extremes</em> \u2013 the volume on the 20th century suffers by comparison; what it really tells is <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v24/n19/perry-anderson/the-age-of-ejh\" title=\"\">the story that emerges more openly in his autobiography</a>, and his political sympathies get in the way. In retrospect that is scarcely surprising and hardly worth <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/01/history.politics\" title=\"\">the fuss that was made at the time</a>.</p> <p>One would not read Hobsbawm for a clear-eyed assessment of communism's limitations, just as one would not find much in his work on the role of gender in history (another blind spot). But what few of us can point to is the kind of extraordinarily sweeping achievement, the transformation of history into a global story, that Hobsbawm pioneered. His legacy continues in the shape of a thriving and outward-looking historical profession, a legacy the more impressive for emanating from a man uninterested in founding any kind of school of his own. To anyone who loves history his death is very sad news. May his books be read for many years to come.</p>",
  "<p>The Titanic, and its striking imagery of the cross-section of Edwardian life, is vividly ingrained on our imaginations. Upstairs: the luxury, the opulence, champagne and chandeliers. Below deck: Irish migrants, Italian waiters, the toil and trouble of a committed crew. Exactly 100 years later, the luxury is no longer so exclusive and the lowest-tier workers certainly aren't European \u2013 but not all that much has changed.</p> <p>Dispatches' investigation <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-111/episode-4\" title=\"\">Cruises Undercover: The Truth Below Deck</a>, which airs tonight on Channel 4 and for which I spent five weeks undercover as an assistant waiter, reveals some of the harsh realities below deck for the multinational workforce who grind to provide once-in-a-lifetime holidays for almost 2 million British cruisers a year. But how is it that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/sep/08/travelnews.uknews.theobserver\" title=\"\">these cruises</a>, as explained in this report from 2002, have been able to get away with providing working conditions well below the legal minimum in the UK for so long, even when operating out of British ports?</p> <p>On 4 August, I set sail from Southampton on the Celebrity Eclipse, an impressive Royal Caribbean-owned cruise liner accommodating just over 4,000 passengers and crew. I was to sign a six-month contract stipulating I'd work straight through without a single day off, living in a small shared cabin. My typical working schedule was 70 hours a week, not including the intensive training schedule I would have to attend in my spare time between shifts. My basic salary was a mere \u00a331 a month, leaving me almost entirely reliant on tips to earn a living. I was assured by the company I'd get a minimum guaranteed wage of \u00a3466 a month, equivalent to \u00a31.54 per hour. If I failed to reach this total in tips, the company would make the difference up to me.</p> <p>I soon met colleagues <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/articles/cruises-undercover-reporters-blog?gjkg\" title=\"\">much worse off than me</a>. I had joined several rungs up the ladder in the caste-like division of labour on the ship; the lowest-ranked workers behind the scenes \u2013 plucked primarily from India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Latin America and Jamaica \u2013 work eight-month contracts without a single day off (sometimes extended to 10 months or more), earning a fixed wage of around \u00a31.24 an hour, with no tips to top this up. They work a 70 hours per week, and often do extra jobs on top of this, such as cutting hair, cleaning staff cabins and laundry, in order to supplement their income.</p> <p>Furthermore, these lower-ranked workers often spend anything up to \u00a32,165 in agency, visa, medical, uniform and flight costs before even starting work, finding themselves trapped in a situation of modern indentured labour in which they spend much of their first contract simply paying off the debts they incurred joining the ship. Once on the ship and heavily indebted, their bargaining power is severely weakened.</p> <p>Equally odious are the strategies that keep staff performing impeccably despite exhausting conditions. Staff in customer-facing positions are paid a negligible wage, so are almost entirely reliant on tips from passengers to make up their salary. Any off-days, and they simply won't make their tips. For those not in tipping positions, the system is far harsher. If they drop the ball they might receive a warning, which means no promotion for a whole year.</p> <p>Such working conditions are certainly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/29/cruise-firm-performance-bonuses-tips\" title=\"\">not unique to Celebrity ships</a>. So how is it that ships full of British passengers setting sail from Southampton do not have to comply with British employment laws? The \"flag of convenience\" is an agreement that allows ships to be flagged in another country, thus avoiding labour regulations and taxation in their country of origin. Despite being headquartered in the US, Celebrity Cruises is registered in Liberia, with the ship I worked on flagged in Malta.</p> <p>This opens the door for cruise companies to seek out a labour force from around the world that would accept conditions that British workers never would (I was the only Englishman on the whole ship doing my job). A race to the bottom ensues, in which labour becomes racialised dependant simply on what conditions workers will accept. Certain nationalities (Filipinos, Indonesians, Indians, Jamaicans) tend to be the only ones prepared to take the lowest jobs, so they usually have to start at the bottom and work their way up. Eastern European and Turks don't need to accept such low pay and long contracts, so start off, like me, several steps up the ladder, and go on to occupy most supervisory roles. Lower-tier workers often keep coming back to the ship, as the company dangles them a carrot in the form of far-off promotions and eventually a better salary. Indeed, for many workers who do stick it out, the ship provides them with a valuable income-stream that enables them to support families back home, and for this they remain grateful despite the toil. But with families to feed, and a lack of jobs at home, this idea of choice often remains an illusion.</p> <p>The ship is a poignant metaphor for wider global divisions; above deck, British passengers who have grown accustomed to affordable luxury, while below deck, an international workforce that has grown equally accustomed to providing the service to make this possible. The cruise ship acts as a floating embodiment of free-market capitalism, shrewdly avoiding international regulations so that maximum profit can be extracted. This convenient tactic should be stopped, so that ships are bound to laws of the country out of which they operate. That way, a cruise may become a good place to work as well as unforgettable trip for passengers.</p>",

He will undertake a one-year study to see whether a cross-party consensus about the long-term needs of UK infrastructure can be achieved, without chopping and changing between parliaments.</p> <p>He argued: \"The lesson of the Olympics is that if we approach major long-term infrastructure projects by building a cross-party sense of national purpose then we can deliver.</p> <p>\"And yet, it took 13 years from the opening of the Channel Tunnel to complete the high-speed rail link to London. Crossrail was delayed for decades.\"</p> <p>He said government was fast losing the confidence of business and that key decisions on infrastructure such as Heathrow were being driven by soap opera politics.</p> <p>He said it was necessary for the government to think innovatively about how these projects could be financed. He said: \"Successive governments, including our own have ducked or delayed vital decisions on our national infrastructure allowing short-term politics.\"</p> <p>Offering himself as a modern equivalent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stafford_Cripps\" title=\"\">Richard Stafford Cripps</a>, the austere chancellor during the post-1945 government of Clement Attlee, Balls repeated his promise to hold a root-and-branch spending review after the next election, but refused to say if he would commit Labour to coalition spending plans ahead of the election. His critics will say he offered no specific example of the cuts he would make.</p> <p>But he did vow to set out his own fiscal rules before the election and promised he would follow the advice of the Office for Budget Responsibility if it ruled he was not going to meet its rules. He said he would not keep George Osborne's meaningless rule that requires government permanently to meet a fiscal rule that is always five years ahead.</p> <p>He promised a full, open and independent public inquiry into the culture and practices of the banking system, radical reform to separate retail and investment banking, active support for mutuals and co-operatives, a continued campaign for an international financial transactions tax and a proper British Investment Bank \u2013 fully backed by the Treasury.</p> <p>Refusing to apologise for the handling of the economic crisis, he said: \"The financial crisis did expose deep-rooted problems in our economy. After the global financial crash, it was always going to be difficult to get the deficit down. And even if we do get the economy growing again, even if we do reform our banking system for the future, we're still going to face tough choices in the years ahead.\"</p> <p>He admitted his inheritance was going to be tougher: \"But the longer this government staggers on with a failing economic plan, the worse it will get and the harder the job will be. Hard times will last longer than all of us hoped. And we cannot promise to put everything right straight away.\"</p> <p>He said: \"That is why, however difficult this may be, when we don't know what we will inherit, we cannot make any commitments now that the next Labour government will be able to reverse particular tax rises or spending cuts. Because, unlike Nick Clegg, we will not make promises we cannot keep.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We must be upfront with the British people that under Labour there would have been cuts and that \u2013 on spending, pay and pensions \u2013 there will be difficult decisions in the future from which we will not flinch.\"</p> <p>But he did not provide details of specific cuts and referred instead to the tough decisions taken by the Attlee government in 1945, such as continuing rationing, cutting defence spending and introducing prescription charges.</p> <p>He instead simply said: \"Before the next election \u2013 when we know the circumstances we will face \u2013 we will set out for our manifesto tough new fiscal rules to get our country's current budget back to balance and national debt on a downward path.\"</p> <p>He said his spending review after the election \"will not opt for short-term cuts that look 'easy' but which end up costing more in the long-term \u2013 like deep cuts to youth services, to adult mental health services and to public health\".</p> <p>He promised not \"to duck the hard long-term issues we know we haven't properly faced up to and which transcend parties and parliaments and where we badly need a cross-party consensus\".</p> <p>He added: \"So let us get a long-term plan to support the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 looked-after children and adults needing social care\".</p> <p>In his most political passage he warned that if the government did not change course Britain faced the risk of a lost decade, and described Clegg as one of the \"same old Tories\". By contrast, he excluded the business secretary, Vince Cable, from his criticisms.</p> <p>He ended by saying: \"Many people have said over recent weeks: 'This has been Britain's greatest ever summer.'</p> <p>\"But let me remind you of an even greater summer still: the summer of 1945 \u2013 the end of six hard years of war \u2013 when our nation welcomed its heroes home from the battlefields of Europe, Asia and the Atlantic, and celebrated together the defeat of fascism.</p> <p>\"Conference, our predecessors were elected that year to rebuild a country ravaged by conflict.</p> <p>\"They faced even greater challenges than we face today: an economy enfeebled by war, a national debt double the size of ours today. And they made tough and unpopular decisions: to continue with rationing, to cut defence spending and to introduce prescription charges.</p> <p>\"But that Labour cabinet also remained focused on the long-term task ahead. And they learned from history and rejected the failed austerity of the 1930s.</p> <p>\"They were very different times. But it is our task to recapture the spirit and values and national purpose of that time.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Think globally, act locally\" urges individuals to consider how switching to local might impact the environment. Through this trade-off, which might come at a relatively small cost (for example in money, effort, or time) and aggregated large-scale benefits (for example, reducing global CO2 emissions), the hope is that people will make choices that will reduce the severity of a wide variety of global environmental problems.</p> <p>Among a wide range of possible choices, individuals are encouraged to conserve energy and natural resources at home and in the workplace, by making changes to their travel and commuting habits, and by choosing foods and other goods that are sourced from environmentally-sensitive production practices.</p> <p>But here's the catch. Some four decades after the concept of think globally, act locally was first introduced, studies suggest that people still fail to make even small changes in their behaviour to address the negative environmental consequences of their actions.</p> <p>And, we observe this trend in spite of the fact that studies also suggest that people the world over are becoming increasingly concerned about the health of the natural environment. So, while think globally, act locally still has appeal in certain professional circles \u2013 among environmental educators, for example \u2013 the concept receives scant attention in environmental policy circles.</p> <p>So, what if we told you that people could achieve the lofty goals of think globally, act locally without having to pull on any policy levers or without having to aggressively pursue initiatives aimed at environmental education? Not only is this possible, it's really quite easy.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/structuring-decision-interest-sustainability?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">preceding pieces</a> in this series, I wrote about the decision making shortcuts we routinely apply during decision making, and how these can lead to systematic biases. I also wrote about how theses biases could be overcome using techniques like structured decision making. In the case of meeting sustainability objectives in the absence of policy shifts, however, the trick is to exploit our judgmental biases by re-engineering the environment in which decisions get made.</p> <p>Much of the work devoted to this approach falls under the umbrella of the somewhat unfortunately named \"libertarian paternalism\", also known as \"nudging\". In one of the best examples of a nudge (and an unintentional one to boot), researchers showed that by making driving license applicants organ donors by default (in other words, to choose to not being an organ donor, they'd have to tick a box on their applications to opt out of the program), organ donation rates could be as much as 20 times higher than in situations where the reverse was true (ie applicants were not donors by default and would have to opt in by ticking a box if they wanted to participate).</p> <p>This natural experiment illustrates how powerful default options can be. We also know from other research that people have a hard time making changes when it comes to decisions. Change is a psychologically difficult thing to do, and frankly, it's often easier to stick with what we have, what we know, or what seems familiar. Indeed, we have a name for this: it's called the status quo bias.</p> <p>In our own research, we've been able to take advantage of the status quo bias in an effort to promote more sustainable decisions and behaviours at the local level (ie in line with think globally, act locally). For example, by making \"low flow\" the default setting on multi-flow showerheads in luxury hotels, we were able to demonstrate that most guests rarely turn their showers to full power, thereby saving water and the energy required to heat it.</p> <p>In cafeterias, by making sustainably sourced foods an \"implied default\" (in that they could be chosen by diners, and served by the wait staff most quickly) as compared to less sustainable options that required a short wait (of just seconds more, rather than minutes), we were able to easily shift most (upwards of 80%) consumer's choices in the direction of more sustainable options.</p> <p>The trick when it comes to nudges is to not restrict options. People must always be allowed to choose an alternative, even unsustainable if they wish, option. And, they must be allowed to choose it without much in the way of additional effort on their part. But the good news is that science shows, in spite of the relative similarities in effort required for both kinds of choice, defaults (or implied defaults) often carry the day in decision making.</p> <p>Getting these defaults \u2013 and by extension, the nudges \u2013 right, and matching them to sustainable outcomes can be a little tricky. But, at the same time, it's not as hard as you might think. And, in terms of the outcomes for promoting sustainable behaviours, nudges are well worth the effort.</p> <p><em>Dr. Joe Arvai is Svare chair in applied decision research for the Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment, and Economy and Haskayne School of Business at </em><a href=\"http://haskayne.ucalgary.ca/profiles/joseph-arvai\" title=\"\"><em>The University of Calgary</em></a>.

We also ran a piece in explaining the thinking behind the exercise. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2011/sep/22/sentamu-archbishop-of-york-fairness-commission-rowntree\">That's here.</a> </p> <p>The seven pillars of fairness wisdom, which the commission hopes to see adopted by York city council, are these: </p> <blockquote> <p><br>1. Make York a Living Wage City&#xa0;and inspire Yorkshire to become a Living Wage Region.<br>&#xa0;<br>2. Deliver an inclusive approach to economic development&#xa0;that creates jobs, tackles worklessness, and ensures all of York's citizens can contribute and prosper.<br>&#xa0;<br>3. Create a simple and shared system to get help and advice to people,including an easy to access central information hub, outreach centres and promotional activity.<br>&#xa0;<br>4. Urgently address the city's housing and accommodation needs&#xa0;to improve availability and affordability for all, and to support sustainable economic growth, backed by a long term strategic framework.<br>&#xa0;<br>5. Make far greater use of&#xa0;early intervention, preventative measures and community based care&#xa0;to support health, independent living and inclusion.<br>&#xa0;<br>6. Ensure that childcare, the learning environment and education help to tackle inequalities.<br>&#xa0;<br>7: Further&#xa0;assess the full range of ideas and proposals for action&#xa0;made in the report&#xa0;and agree mechanisms for taking them forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>You can read or download the full report from the <a href=\"http://www.yorkfairnesscommission.org.uk\">commission's website, here</a>. </p> <p>Archbishop Sentamu says:</p> <blockquote> <p>You can judge how healthy a society is by how it treats the most vulnerable people. Research has conclusively shown that a more equal society is a happier society. If we want to see York prosper and flourish we must reduce its societal divide. It is our duty and our responsibility.<br>&#xa0;<br>I am delighted that the Fairness Commission is calling for a Living Wage to be introduced across the city. People should be paid a fair wage for a fair day's work \u2013 anything else is unjust. I hope York will take the lead on tackling inequality and that others across the country will follow. It is over to the politicians and the public now.</p> <p>You can judge how healthy a society is by how it treats the most vulnerable people. Research has conclusively shown that a more equal society is a happier society. If we want to see York prosper and flourish we must reduce its societal divide. It is our duty and our responsibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>The commission's chair, <a href=\"http://www.yorkfairnesscommission.org.uk/ruthredfern.html\">Ruth Redfern</a>, says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Our first report's focus was on influencing and advising the council on its budget setting process, squaring the need to make the sizeable cuts forced upon it with commitment to equity and social justice.&#xa0; We are pleased that key recommendations from that report have been taken up, and we hope that action will also be taken on our detailed recommendations in the full report.<br>&#xa0;<br>This takes our work a step further by considering how to promote fairness in the long term and across the whole of York. We believe that reducing inequality, particularly of wealth and incomes, and standing up for and empowering those who are most vulnerable in society will not only increase fairness, but will create benefits to society as a whole.</p> </blockquote> <p>She adds: </p> <blockquote> <p>York was home to the active philanthropist <a href=\"http://www.rowntreesociety.org.uk/\">Joseph Rowntree</a>, whose commitment to finding ways of reducing poverty lives on to this day. It is therefore no surprise that York is, by any measure, a fairer city than most.</p> <p>Our reputation for fairness is also why we recommend that York hosts an international summit on Fairness on behalf of the UK. Our country has much to learn from less unequal societies and learn we should.</p> <p>Our principles to 'fairness-proof' activity and decision making in York are clear and easily followed. Our ideas for action come directly and significantly from the citizens of York. There is nothing in the report that cannot be actioned and will not, when actioned, have a positive effect on fairness.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396967688\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/6/14/1339666098897/Poor-need-rise-in-minimum-002.jpg\" alt=\"Poor 'need rise in minimum wage'\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minimum wage.

It's a clich\u00e9, but we have a tale of two cities, in the same place. The other crucial background, on a day when the national minimum wage for over-21s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/01/minimum-wage-over-21s-rises\">crept up</a> by 11p to \u00a36.19 (and 5p more for apprentices who get just \u00a32.65 an hour), is that the council must save \u00a319.7m in the the next two years to meet government spending cuts.</p> <p>Archbishop Sentamu adds:</p> <blockquote> <p>I hope too that the ten Fairness Principles become the blueprint for decision making in York in the years to come.

  "<p>I didn't miss it for one whole year,\" Gianfranco Zola says with a wry shake of his head as he remembers his slow recovery from losing his first job as a football manager. After he was treated so badly at West Ham United, with the chairman David Sullivan's undermining of him culminating in Zola's sacking in May 2010, the little Italian retreated from football. A brilliant player, and one of the Premier League's most cherished characters, Zola's managerial debut had been a painful saga.</p> <p>Having steered West Ham to ninth place in his opening season, Zola was dismissed after the club just escaped relegation a year later. His last six months at Upton Park were especially troubled as Sullivan, among more puzzling interventions, complained that Zola was \"too nice\" and \"too soft\" to succeed in a bruising business. West Ham went down the following season, under a different manager in Avram Grant, while Zola tried to get over everything he had endured at Upton Park.</p> <p>\"I was exhausted,\" Zola says quietly. \"Physically, emotionally and mentally it takes a lot out of you. I really was tired and I also needed to catch up with so many other things in my life. But after one year my feelings began to change. I started to think about football again.\"</p> <p>Zola shrugs and laughs. He is now in charge of Watford and just a few minutes earlier he'd had to decide whether we would sit down for this interview at crumbling old Vicarage Road in the Luther Blissett suite or in a room named after John Barnes. \"I think we'll take John Barnes,\" Zola said. \"He was a great player. A very skillful player.\"</p> <p>Great skill epitomised the purity of Zola as a player but complexities continue to frame his embryonic managerial career. Watford might appear a gentle step back into a more realistic environment than the overheated Premier League but Zola's new position is challenging. Last week the Daily Mail published a feature headlined: Watford are a snapshot of all that's wrong with the modern game.</p> <p>\"They told me about it,\" Zola says of his press office's response, \"but I didn't read it.\"</p> <p>Watford are now owned by the Pozzo family \u2013 who gradually turned Udinese from Serie B stragglers into consistent qualifiers for the Champions League. The Italian club still struggle to make the group stages of Europe's premier competition but their transformation has encouraged the Pozzos to look towards Spain and now England. Giampaolo Pozzo, a businessman, and his son Gino, bought Granada in 2009 and two years later an unheralded club gained promotion to La Liga. The family aspires to a similar rise with Watford.</p> <p>Last season under Sean Dyche, a former journeyman player who had emerged as a competent young manager, Watford small's squad exceeded all expectations and finished 11th \u2013 ahead of famous clubs such as Leeds United and Nottingham Forest. Dyche, who had once played for Watford, relied on mostly British players. Yet, following the Pozzo family's takeover, Dyche's fate was predictable. He was sacked and replaced by the illustrious&#xa0;Zola.</p> <p>The story now becomes more interesting. Zola could hardly be more different to a swaggering star. The 46 year-old former Chelsea idol is as engaging as he is thoughtful \u2013 and his experience at West Ham has instilled in him an awareness of the difficulties and inequities of his often impossible trade.</p> <p>Asked if he feels under increased pressure to prove himself, Zola does not hesitate. \"I do know this is a big opportunity for me,\" he says, \"and it is demanding. But it is a positive pressure.\"</p> <p>Zola still ended up attempting to manage a first-team squad of 42 players. Fourteen of a bloated squad are on loan, with 10 coming from Udinese, and 15 different nationalities are now represented at Vicarage Road. I remind Zola that when I interviewed him during his West Ham tenure he lamented that the most difficult aspect of being a manager was telling a player he had failed to make the matchday team.</p> <p>\"And now there are a lot of players I have to tell: 'No, not this week!'\" he exclaims through his trademark grin. \"I am getting used to it but, still, you feel some pain whenever you say 'sorry' to a player who has worked hard all week. But it is part of the job and as long as you are honest and straightforward you are OK.\"</p> <p>But how does Zola cope with a squad that is so unwieldy he has had to divide his 42 players into three different training groups? \"We did have 42,\" he admits, \"but now some are injured and others have gone on loan. So I have a more manageable number now. [Last] week we trained with only 21 players.\"</p> <p>It must still be difficult to forge unity in an amorphous squad? \"This is the biggest challenge,\" Zola says. \"I have no doubt about the quality of the players \u2013 but you have to turn them into a team. If you have no unity and compactness you will struggle. So this is my main priority and each week it gets better.\"</p> <p>Saturday's victory away to then second-placed Huddersfield endorsed Zola's claim. Watford took a 2-1 lead in the 83rd minute, only to immediately concede an equaliser, before they forced a winning penalty three minutes from time. Watford might still only be 19th in a packed league of 24 scrapping clubs but they are only four points from the play-off positions. \"The table doesn't indicate much right now,\" Zola says. \"This is a long-term project. I like working with young players. But I also like the family's idea that we will work first on the quality of football and then the results will follow.</p> <p>\"If you watch our games you'll see we are going in the right direction in terms of the football we want to play. At the moment our problem is that we're not playing it for the whole game. Before it was 45 minutes, now it's maybe 60 minutes. Slowly, we will get there. We look both positive and solid \u2013 but our rhythm drops. We are working on that and I have no doubt we will get there.\"</p> <p>All Zola's talk of playing football in \"the right way\" will be meaningless unless Watford add more consistency after just three wins in eight games. \"I do understand that. But people have to be patient because it's not easy. I am trying to change things. We have a lot of new players coming in and they need time to settle. So we are not playing to win the Championship this year \u2013 that's for sure. Our supporters know this. For us it's a transition year. But we are playing well.\"</p> <p>Watford are away again on Tuesday night, against Charlton Athletic, and so how is Zola coping with the Championship treadmill? \"I can't switch off after games and it's very difficult because in the Championship you play Saturday and Tuesday. But it's interesting. Even in this league some teams are trying to play more football with different formations. So there is more variety in the Championship now. But, yes, we have to play teams that try to dominate you physically. That is normal here.\"</p> <p>Zola's ebullience is hard to resist as he recounts his reaction to Watford's defeat of Crystal Palace on the opening day of the season \u2013 when his team, trailing 2-1, scored two goals in the last three minutes. \"I was jumping up and down,\" Zola laughs helplessly. \"I can't stop jumping on the touchline.\"</p> <p>This passionate conviction belies any accusation that Zola is just a famous name trading on faded glory. \"The key asset for Udinese, and for the family, is a very good scouting network,\" he says. \"They pick up promising youngsters and work with them and turn them into very good players. They have found a way to manage the club that is very healthy financially and very competitive on the field. Udinese don't have the resources at Inter or Milan, or even Lazio or Roma. They don't have anything like the fanbase of those teams but for the last three years they still managed to make it to the Champions League [qualifying matches]. So they have a very good model for running a football club and their idea now is to repeat this in other countries. I totally understand the choice of England because football is unbelievable here.\"</p> <p>The family's goal is to eventually turn Watford into a respectable Premier League club. \"It will take time but the owners have the ambition to do this. They work very hard and their success is no coincidence.\"</p> <p>Zola's own zeal for work is beyond question. He also believes he has become a better manager after his problematic stint at West Ham. \"I learnt many lessons from some tough experiences. One of the biggest was that no matter what happens you need to hold on to your beliefs. And you must stay humble. During my time away from football I was with Milan and Barcelona during training. The most impressive thing about Barcelona was how humble they all are. The humility of the players and staff was fantastic.\"</p> <p>As we walk out onto the pitch at Vicarage Road, on an autumnal evening, it's easy to retain a sense of humility in Watford. One side of the stadium is dilapidated and in urgent need of rebuilding while, down the dingy tunnel leading from the dressing room, a 'Mind Your Head' sign has been tacked up in warning. There is neither svelte luxury nor tiki-taka romance at this ground.</p> <p>Yet Zola's good cheer is contagious whether he is reflecting on the Olympics, Chelsea winning the Champions League or how much he enjoys working with his large squad at Watford. But after his dispiriting end at West Ham surely he fell briefly out of love with football? \"No. Obviously there was a moment when I was tired because it was very demanding. But I never lost my passion \u2013 otherwise I would not be here. Football is like this. You get fired. But for a young manger like me it is a process that's going to make me better.</p> <p>\"You know I speak a lot to Roberto [Di Matteo]. We have that relationship where we keep in touch. It's amazing what he did last season at Chelsea. He was fired at West Brom. He then got this short opportunity at Chelsea late last season and no one gave Roberto a chance. Chelsea was going down in the league but all of a sudden they won the FA Cup. They won the Champions League. Incredible. That sums up football. It is so unpredictable. That's the crazy magic of football. So as a manager you need a very good balance as a person because it will test you a lot. We are being challenged here, at Watford, but I think we will pass the test.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"Are you completely mad?\" one of my authors asked me. \"I thought your agency was deluged by manuscripts \u2013 why ask for more?\"</p> <p>He was wondering why Curtis Brown, one of the UK's largest literary agencies, which receives between 600 and 800 manuscripts a month, wanted to welcome yet more at <a href=\"http://www.foyles.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Foyles</a> in central London last month. <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/curtis-brown-and-foyles-team-author-discovery-day.html\" title=\"\">\"Discovery Day\"</a> \u2013 an open day for any unpublished writer to pitch to an agent \u2013 was designed to open up the doors of the seemingly inward-looking publishing industry. </p> <p>Eight minutes of expert feedback were followed by a 15-minute surgery in the caf\u00e9 to probe further, and then a panel discussion with a leading author, a publisher and an agent to round off the day. Three hundred and fifty writers signed up within two days.</p> <p>To be honest, we didn't know what to expect. Hundreds of smartly attired, serious minded and slightly nervous writers trickled through the doors. A 15-year-old schoolgirl who told me she was serious about her writing; a mournful-looking accountant who had quit the profession to finish his first novel, which sadly was not worth quitting the profession for; a heavily accented artist who was willing to listen to edits as long as they didn't change any element of the story. One woman told me about her eco mystery, which sounded good aside from the terms \"eco\" and \"mystery\". We turned it into a high-concept thriller with global impact.</p> <p>A woman came from Texas, another from Cyprus and daytrippers from Southampton and Belfast. One young dad pitched with a baby strapped to his front who remained silent during the whole thing like a true pro. A new breed of writer is emerging. Savvy, informed, focused and in control.</p> <p>So what advice did we give? Drill your story down to 10 words and then build up; if your novel has too much back story it is not a novel but an explanation; speak your dialogue out loud to test if everyone sounds the same ... and so on.</p> <p>Publishing is going through a revolution \u2013 bookshops are in turmoil, self-publishing is on the rise, the big six publishers are on the run \u2013 and yet one truth remains. We all want a good story, told well. So, to my author's question \"why ask for more?\", I say: why ask for less?</p> <p>\u2022 Jonny Geller is joint CEO of <a href=\"http://curtisbrowncreative.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Curtis Brown</a></p>",

Franklin will be at the Tory party conference next week, while other \"welfare warriors\" were at the Lib Dem conference last week and this week's Labour party conference in Manchester. She says while disability and welfare weren't on the agenda at last year's conferences, <a href=\"http://benefitscroungingscum.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/party-politics-and-penis-polling-lab12.html\">this year \"we are being listened to\"</a>. And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All any of us can promise when lobbying like this is that we will do our utmost to explain, persuade and bring about change. It is definitely the cumulative impact of so many different groups of sick and disabled people all campaigning to their strengths whether that be by direct action or the more subtle charm and disarm which are pushing forward progress. If we stop to look up we see our friends still suffering terribly at the hands of this cruel system, but if we turn to look back we can see just how far we have all travelled and look forward with hope to a time of change. </p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 The astonishing findings of a new poll by the thinktank Demos, which reveals that most people believe the government <a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/press_releases/majority-support-government-control-of-how-people-spend-benefit-payments\">should start controlling how welfare recipients spend their money</a>. Almost nine out of 10 people said at least one group of <strong>welfare recipients</strong> \u2013 such as those with a substance or gambling addiction, or those with a criminal or anti-social history \u2013 should have their benefits controlled. Demos's deputy director Claudia Wood said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It suggests that many now view the welfare state as a form of charity towards the poor rather than social insurance for all. If the majority still saw the welfare state as an insurance scheme - a contract of protection in return for contribution - then people would be more supportive of autonomy for benefit claimants.<br>The government's rhetoric around 'problem families' and 'scroungers' is clearly shaking people's faith in the welfare state.

  "<p>The NGO Islamic Relief has urged the UN to establish a global contingency fund for disaster prevention as it is cheaper to help prepare for floods and drought than spend billions on emergencies.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.islamic-relief.com/\" title=\"\">report on Monday, Feeling the Heat,</a> the charity also called on governments and aid agencies to completely rethink their priorities and put disaster risk reduction at the heart of all aid programmes.</p> <p>\"We need to give poor countries a fighting chance against climate change by investing in things like drought-resistant crops, rebuilding flood-prone houses on higher ground and preserving food and seeds for when disaster strikes,\" says Shahnawaz Ali, head of climate change and disaster resilience for Islamic Relief Bangladesh. \"If we do that, we will not only save lives but save a lot of money on emergency aid.\"</p> <p>The group said it cost \u00a3400 for Islamic Relief to protect a family in the Gaibanda district of Bangladesh from floods for five years by raising their land to a higher level, less than the \u00a3440 in emergency aid the same family would need in one month if they lost everything in a major flood.</p> <p>Islamic Relief is the latest aid group to argue that prevention is better than cure. The EU commissioner on humanitarian aid, Kristalina Georgieva, strongly supports aid efforts that build up the capacity of communities to withstand shocks like drought or floods. Research from the US government says $1 of risk reduction spending can result in as much as a $15 decrease in disaster damage.</p> <p>Despite common knowledge that investment in preventive measures is cost-effective in the long run, Islamic Relief said only a tiny proportion of aid goes on disaster risk reduction (DRR). In 2010, the world spent 23 times as much on emergency relief for the 10 countries hit hardest by disasters as it spent on disaster prevention.</p> <p>There have been international efforts to shift aid priorities towards risk reduction. After the Indian Ocean tsunami that killed almost 230,000 people in 2004, the UN general assembly agreed the <a href=\"http://www.unisdr.org/we/coordinate/hfa\" title=\"\">Hyogo Framework for Action</a>, in which 168 countries put their names to a 10-year-commitment to disaster risk reduction.</p> <p>This little-known agreement was mentioned at the Rio+20 summit in June, when governments were urged to \"accelerate implementation\" of the framework. Hyogo, a non-binding framework, called for a 1% allocation of national development budgets to DRR, along with 10% of humanitarian aid financing and 10% of reconstruction and recovery funds.</p> <p>Islamic Relief said progress is being made. Australia, the European commission and the UK have put resilience at the centre of their aid efforts, while Colombia, Indonesia and other at-risk countries are developing strong disaster programmes. Nevertheless, risk reduction and prevention remain the \"Cinderellas of the aid world\".</p> <p>Its report cited research by <a href=\"http://www.devinit.org/\" title=\"\">Development Initiatives</a> showing that only <a href=\"http://www.globalhumanitarianassistance.org/report/disaster-risk-reduction-spending-where-it-should-count\" title=\"\">1% of all development aid goes towards DRR</a>. Islamic Relief said the most disturbing results were in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/sep/28/sahel-chronic-hunger-crisis-solutions?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">west Africa, which is now dealing with floods after drought</a>. The situation is particularly stark in west Africa, where millions of people in the five countries worst affected by drought, received only 12p for disaster risk reduction (DRR) in every \u00a3100 of aid spending over the five years to 2010.</p> <p>\"[In the Sahel] From 2005 to 2010, disaster risk reduction amounted to only 0.12% of all aid \u2013 less than for any of the other countries we examined, and far less than the 1% overall percentage identified by Development Initiatives,\" said the report.</p> <p>Islamic Relief criticised donors for \"fiddling\" aid figures, citing the case of money for climate mitigation and adaptation. Donors had promised to provide new funding of about $30bn for 2010-12. In 2010, $22.9bn was provided for climate mitigation, about 15% of total official development aid (ODA).</p> <p>\"If the funding was truly additional, we would expect ODA spending to have been substantially higher than in 2009. ODA did indeed rise over 2009 levels, to $128.5bn. But if climate funding is deducted, ODA actually dropped \u2013 by 11.85%. What we are witnessing is a donors' shell game in which funding is being reallocated under different budget heads and cut at the same time,\" said the report.</p> <p>Islamic Relief urged the UN and governments to come up with a \"bold and binding international agreement to protect poor communities better when the voluntary and rather toothless Hyogo framework for action expires in 2015\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hi Daniele, can you tell us a little bit more about </strong><a href=\"http://www.cheil.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cheil</strong></a><strong> and your role there as head of innovation? </strong></p> <p>Until recently Cheil UK has been one of London's best-kept secrets. It's a 100-strong integrated advertising agency \u2013 my job there as head of innovation is to make sure we stop being a secret and grow beyond our original Samsung heritage with new clients. That means working hard to build a culture that fosters innovation and ideas. It also means staying on top of current trends, understanding any impact they could have on our clients and their communications issues, and consequently delivering better ways to solve problems for them.</p> <p>Before Cheil I ran a global digital marketing agency called <a href=\"http://www.profero.com/\" title=\"\">Profero</a> with two friends. We grew it from 22 people in London to more than 300, with offices in London, Madrid, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney and New York. I left to run my own consultancy for 18 months, and then joined Cheil.</p> <p><strong>What does your average day look like?</strong></p> <p>Fortunately, there's no such thing as an average day (one of the reasons I left Profero after 10 years is because all of a sudden I found I was constantly doing the same things). Now my days will comprise of anything and everything including work on client briefs, team brainstorms, new business meetings, internal team talks and external recruitment interviews. And I always make an effort every week to meet someone interesting, preferably at lunch or for a quick drink after work!</p> <p><strong>What are the biggest challenges to your job and how do you overcome them?</strong></p> <p>My biggest challenge is figuring out where to focus my energy; my role inevitably means there's so much I could cover, but not enough time to cover it. Lists are my saving grace \u2013 I've become much better at using them to prioritise, and working closely with my boss and peers to bounce ideas around also helps to maintain perspective.</p> <p><strong>What first made you want to work in advertising?</strong></p> <p>Not many people know this, but my first work in advertising was actually starring in a TV commercial (it was for a series of karaoke tapes from Italian publisher Fabbri Editori and I'm thankful there was no YouTube in those days). That was my first taste of the energy that's inherent in this business, but my big break came when I was looking to leave PwC (I started my career as an accountant) and one of my best friends asked me to join his little digital advertising agency. I was extremely lucky to get that opportunity \u2013 that agency was Profero \u2013 and I've never looked back since.</p> <p><strong>What's do you think is the key to being a good at what you do as head of innovation?</strong></p> <p>Innovation for me is about finding better ways to solve problems as well as opening up opportunities that weren't there previously. It's left brain and right brain working in sync to create compelling and practical solutions. My business background coupled with my agency experience allows me to really marry an idea with solving a business problem in that way. One of the big attractions of Cheil is that it's unavoidably integrated, which means ideas aren't limited by a media discipline or channel.</p> <p>The other key ingredient is an interest in people, something which I've always had \u2013 it's this inherent curiosity about what motivates people to make decisions that also helps in my role. Finally, you need to be a self-starter because a lot of the time, it really is up to you to create opportunities.</p> <p><strong>What would you say your management style is?</strong></p> <p>When I was 18 years old my parents let me manage their restaurant for 6 months, with very little interference. That experience taught me a lot, with the most notable lesson being: give people the room and space to make their own decisions and mistakes while still giving them direction and support when they need it. I hope that's how I manage. My expectations are high, certainly, and I can be quite tough, but I always try to be fair too. This approach clearly isn't for everyone but I hope I foster good team communication, and people enjoy working with me.</p> <p><strong>What online resource can you not do your job without?</strong></p> <p>That's impossible to answer because I'm constantly online and hungry for ideas and inspiration. But if push really came to shove, I'd hate to lose the people I follow on Twitter.</p> <p><strong>What in advertising is really exciting you the most at the moment?</strong></p> <p>No question, it's the fact that social media has changed the communications landscape forever, and we still don't really know what the long term impact will be. The one sure thing is that ad land is going to have to change accordingly, despite the fact that insight into people and their behaviour, coupled with ideas and creativity, will always be at its heart.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see advertising and digital marketing in the next 5 years?</strong></p> <p>Wow! I'm not sure I really know where it'll be in the next 6 months, but I am convinced that any distinctions between advertising and digital marketing will be gone forever \u2013 everything will be digital (in my mind, it already is). We're also going to have similar issues with the distinction between digital, mobile and social very soon.</p> <p><strong>What three tips would you give to a advertising professional or graduate looking to get to where you are?</strong></p> <p>Be curious, work hard (but have fun), and get out there and meet people</p> <p><strong>Any last words? </strong></p> <p>I'm with Confucius: \"Love what you do and you'll never work a day in your life.\"</p> <p><em>Daniele Fiandaca is head of innovation at </em><a href=\"http://www.cheil.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Cheil</em></a><em> \u2013 follow Daniele on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yellif\" title=\"\"><em>@yellif</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Environmental activists in the United States and Russia have come together to push for unprecedented protection for the polar bear, hoping to stave off the decline of its already dwindling population.</p> <p>With Arctic Sea ice at record low because of climate change, polar bears have been deprived of a key habitat and feeding ground. Legal trade in polar bears, mainly in the form of trophy skins and furs, remains legal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), leading to the death of hundreds more each year.</p> <p>Activists from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Human Society International (HSI) are hoping to change that by supporting government initiatives to upgrade the polar bear's status from appendix two to one within the convention, thus banning all international commercial trade.</p> <p>\"The real opportunity to ban the trade is around the corner,\" said Jeffrey Flocken, head of IFAW's Washington DC office. Activists have been lobbying officials in the US to table the so-called \"uplist\" proposal by 4 October, ahead of a global Cites conference early next year, but fear US reluctance after a similar proposal did not pass a vote at the convention's last meeting in Doha in 2010.</p> <p>IFAW activists have also received written assurances from the Russian ministry of natural resources that it will support an initiative tabled by the US, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the Guardian. Activists hope that joint Russian-US support will help the motion receive the two-thirds vote it needs to pass inside the 176-country body.</p> <p>They warned of increasing urgency, following recent reports by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Arctic Sea ice had declined to record lows</a>. At the same time, prices for polar bear skins have soared, prompting increased hunting and poaching.</p> <p>\"Polar bears are becoming more and more scarce, and that scarcity is driving up demand,\" said Teresa Telecky of HSI. \"It's helping drive the species towards extinction,\" she said.</p> <p>At a recent auction in Canada, two polar bear pelts fetched a record \u00a310,200 each \u2013 about double the price at auctions five years ago. Canada is the only country to allow its polar bears to be killed and sold on international markets, something its indigenous population argue is key to its survival and livelihood.</p> <p>In one Moscow shop, a large polar bear hide was going for 1.6m roubles (\u00a331,760). The luxury items are most popular among buyers in Russia and China.</p> <p>Russian websites have popped up to sell Cites certificates that indicate a legal kill under Canada's quota, something used by many of the poachers who kill an average 200 polar bears in Russia per year, activists said. Nearly 6,000 polar bears are believed to have been killed between 2001 and 2010, with that number increasing in the past two years, according to IFAW and HSI.</p> <p>The world's polar bear population is now estimated at around 20,000, activists said. The US Geological Survey warned in 2007 that diminishing sea ice could result in the loss of two-thirds of the world's polar bear population within 50 years.</p>",

  "<p>UK manufacturing activity dropped again in September, fuelling fears that the economy is deteriorating after a brief rebound.</p> <p>The news will reinforce the belief that the Bank of England will be forced extend its quantitative easing (QE) programme beyond its \u00a3375bn limit once the current round of asset purchases is complete in November.</p> <p>The UK data came amid a series of dismal manufacturing surveys from around the world.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/01/eurozone-crisis-austerity-protests-unemployment-manufacturing#block-5069554bc0e3eab0be492b43\" title=\"\"> Europe's factory sector suffered its worst quarter</a> since 2009, making it almost certain the region will drop into a double-dip recession in the third quarter.</p> <p>Markit said the UK had suffered from the crisis in the currency bloc. Chris Williamson, an economist at the financial information services company, said: \"Overseas sales continue to be hit by the ongoing deterioration in global economic growth, with the eurozone \u2013 the UK's largest export market \u2013 at the epicentre of the weakness.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=10125\" title=\"\">Markit PMI survey for September</a> came in at 48.4, dropping further below 50, the mark that separates expansion from contraction. It fell short of analyst expectations of 49.3, and compares with August's reading of 49.6.</p> <p>UK manufacturers suffered a double blow of falling output and rising costs. Companies said the decrease in output was caused by a decline in new export business and subdued demand at home. Costs surged in September, driven by the rising price of chemicals, energy, food, metals, oil and plastics.</p> <p>Overall new orders inched up last month, but Markit said the rate of growth was only a marginal increase after severe contractions this year. The tough conditions led manufacturers to cut jobs for the fifth month in a row.</p> <p>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the data provided a \"dose of reality\" and suggested the Bank of England would deliver another \u00a350bn of QE in November. \"Although the economy is showing some signs of improvement and inflation could be sticky over the coming months, it is extended weak economic activity rather than inflation that remains the greatest risk facing the UK economy,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Domestic and global economic conditions are still tough, with major uncertainty and problems still surrounding the eurozone.\"</p>",
  "<p>Countries with ageing populations can reap a \"longevity dividend\" with the right measures on healthcare, pensions and legal protection, according to a new UN report published on Monday.</p> <p>But while important progress has been made by many countries in adopting new policies and laws on ageing, more needs to be done to fulfil the potential of older people, said <a href=\"http://www.helpage.org/resources/ageing-in-the-21st-century-a-celebration-and-a-challenge/\" title=\"\">Ageing in the 21st century: a celebration and a challenge.</a></p> <p>In 2000, for the first time, there were more people over the age of 60 than children under five. By 2050, the older generation will be larger than the under-15 population. In just 10 years, the number of older people \u2013 defined as over 60 \u2013 will surpass 1 billion people \u2013 an increase of about 200 million people over the decade.</p> <p>\"The social and economic implications of this phenomenon are profound, extending far beyond the individual older person and the immediate family, touching broader society and the global community in unprecedented ways,\" wrote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon\" title=\"\">Ban Ki-moon</a>, the UN secretary general, in the report's preface.</p> <p>The report urged governments, international organisations and civil society to commit fully to a concerted global effort to realign policy to the realities of 21st-century demographics. Population ageing \u2013 when older people become a proportionately larger share of the total population \u2013 is happening in all countries, but it is happening fastest in poor countries.</p> <p>Of the 15 countries with more than 10 million older people, seven are in the developing world. Two out of three people aged 60 or older live in developing and emerging economies. By 2050, this will rise to nearly four out of five, according to the report.</p> <p>\"If not addressed promptly, the consequences of these issues are likely to take unprepared countries by surprise,\" said the report. \"In many developing countries with large populations of young people, for example, the challenge is that governments have not put policies and practices in place to support their current older populations or made enough preparations for 2050.\"</p> <p>Declining fertility rates and increasing survival at older ages have led to population ageing. Life expectancy at birth has risen substantially across the world. In 2010-15, life expectancy is 78 in rich countries and 68 in poor countries. By 2045-50, newborns can expect to live to 83 in developed countries and 74 in developing countries.</p> <p>While both older men and women face age discrimination, older women face the cumulative effects of gender discrimination throughout their lives, including less access to education and health, lower earning capacity and limited access to rights to land ownership.</p> <p>Financial security and health are cited as among the most urgent concerns by older people, while meeting those concerns poses acute challenges for governments, particularly at a time of global economic crisis, said the report.</p> <p>\"Social protection floors must be implemented in order to guarantee income security and access to essential health and social services for all older persons and provide a safety net that contributes to the postponement of disability and prevention of impoverishment in old age,\" it said.</p> <p>The report pointed out that only one-third of countries have comprehensive social protection schemes, most of which only cover those in formal employment, or less than half of the economically active population worldwide.</p> <p>The report from the <a href=\"http://www.unfpa.org\" title=\"\">UN Population Fund</a> and <a href=\"http://www.helpage.org/\" title=\"\">HelpAge International</a>, an advocacy group, comes 10 years after the <a href=\"http://social.un.org/index/Ageing/Resources/MadridInternationalPlanofActiononAgeing.aspx\" title=\"\">Madrid international plan of action on ageing</a> \u2013 the first time ageing was linked with human rights.</p> <p>The broad aim of Madrid is to ensure that people are able to age with security and dignity. Madrid remains the sole international instrument on ageing and there is no binding international convention specifically on older people. The Madrid plan noted the contribution older people make to society not just financially through tax payments, but also in ways not measured in economic terms, particularly childcare, with grandparents minding children so parents can work.</p> <p>Some countries have approved national policies on ageing since Madrid, with Brazil passing the law for the rights of older people in 2003. \"It is a specific law which guarantees the rights of older persons,\" said Laura Machado, UN international co-ordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.iagg.info/\" title=\"\">International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics</a>. \"We did have a national policy but, like the Madrid plan, it was a recommendation not an obligation. The law is very important because older persons now say they are respected.\"</p> <p>The law gives priority to older job applicants if they are just as qualified as younger ones, has scrapped the mandatory retirement age of 60, and allows older people to buy half-price tickets for the theatre, the cinema and concerts. Transport is also free for people over 65.</p> <p>Machado said there is a split between rich and poor countries on the need for a legally binding international instrument on ageing along the lines of the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/\" title=\"\">UN convention on discrimination against women</a>.</p> <p>\"It is clear there are two groups with very different positions,\" she said. \"The EU especially does not consider such a convention on older persons necessary, whereas the Latin American bloc wants a legally binding instrument that will pave the way for laws at the state level. It is a very important debate at the UN level.\"</p>",

I think quite a few others will do the same.\"</p> <p>This weekend the four were one of a number of activists out in a <a href=\"http://www.visitforestofdean.co.uk/\" title=\"\">soggy Forest of Dean</a> getting ready to thwart the marksmen.</p> <p>Plans had been afoot to hold a full moon rave in the Gloucestershire forest on what the anti-cull brigade had anticipated could be the first weekend of the shooting.</p> <p>But the opening volleys have yet to be fired and so instead the likes of C and his colleagues spent the weekend preparing: mapping setts and familiarising themselves with the lie of the land so they will be ready when the cull does begin.</p> <p>They have a huge job on their hands. The cull area in Gloucestershire is 116 sq miles (300 sq km), much of it within private land hard to access.</p> <p>But they are not going from a standing start. C and Jack say they sabotaged more than 6,000 traps over six years during the Krebs trial badger cull, which began in the late 90s, and so know much of the area well.</p> <p>On Saturday, they estimate they mapped about 23 sq miles (60 sq km) in the north of the forest, which they are not so familiar with because it was not part of the Krebs cull.</p> <p>Jack admits he suffers from a touch of sciatica and so is not as nimble as he used to be, but fortunately for these veterans it appears that a new generation of activists is joining the fight against the cull.</p> <p>On Sunday, C took out a group of 20 newcomers to the animal rights movement, teaching them how to map the setts, how to spot areas cleared for shooting, tutoring them in the law on trespass, advising them on the sorts of methods they could use \u2013 from setting off rape alarms to blowing vuvuzela horns \u2013 to disrupt the shooting when it starts.</p> <p>\"We've got a large area to cover but we know it well and there are hundreds of new people coming in who want to help,\" said C.</p> <p>Jenny, one of the new generation of activists, spent much of her weekend <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/stop.the.cull\" title=\"\">plastering anti-cull posters on road signs</a>, gates and stiles.</p> <p>A 21-year-old student from Worcestershire, she said this was her first taste of direct action. \"I haven't really been into this sort of thing before but I've read the articles on the science behind the cull and it just doesn't seem to make sense to me. They seem to be killing the badgers to try to stay on the right side of the farmers. It can't be right. What will they do if this doesn't work. Go after the deer? Do they just want to kill all our wildlife?\"</p> <p>This remains a period of phoney war. English Nature <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/first-badger-cull-licence-england\" title=\"\">issued the licence for the badger cull</a>, which is intended to help halt the scourge of TB in cattle, in Gloucestershire in mid-September.</p> <p>A second licence for an area in Somerset is expected to be issued any day now.</p> <p>But one of the organisations set up to try to prevent the shooting by taking direct action, <a href=\"http://badger-killers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Stop the Cull</a>, has suggested the cull may not go ahead this year because farmers in the cull zones are not stumping up the money needed to fund it.</p> <p>They claim some farmers in the cull zone are wavering because they have felt intimidated by people lurking near their farms and do not believe they can be protected by the police. The farmers' union, the NFU, insists its members within the cull zones remain steadfast.</p> <p>The champions of direct action are not the only ones continuing to fight the cull. Almost 140,000 people have <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">signed a petition</a> against the cull created by the rock star Brian May on the government's website.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://e-activist.com/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=105&amp;ea.campaign.id=16188&amp;s_src=web_pb_hpbb0906012\" title=\"\">Humane Society International</a> is pursuing a complaint against the government with the Bern convention, a European treaty to protect wildlife while the <a href=\"http://www.badger.org.uk/content/groups.asp\" title=\"\">Badger Trust</a> has also pledged to pursue any legal route to challenge culling licences.</p> <p>Those against the cull are taking heart from growing local political unease. The Conservative-led <a href=\"http://www.fdean.gov.uk/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=7966&amp;tt=graphic\" title=\"\">Forest of Dean district council</a> has passed a motion banning badger culling on its land. This is a gesture as it only has a few acres but more significantly is contacting all landowners within its boundary to request them to refuse any culling of badgers.</p> <p>Labour councillor Jackie Fraser, who proposed the motion, said she believed most people in the Forest of Dean were against the cull. \"They think the badger is a much-maligned creature,\" she said.</p> <p>In addition, members of a Gloucestershire county council committee has asked the authority to review its policy of badger culling on its land.</p> <p>Another factor that could affect the cull is the weather. Though badgers do not hibernate, they do lie low during the worst of the winter weather.</p> <p>Jan Rowe, a Gloucestershire farmer who speaks for the NFU on bovine TB, told the Guardian that the ideal time for the six-week cull to have taken place would have been between August and the end of October. He said the cull, which has to take place over a six-week continuous spell, needed to begin by mid-October.</p> <p>Rowe insisted farmers in the cull area were paying up and accused the Stop the Cull campaign of trying to divide and rule by claiming that farmers were wavering. \"I believe and hope the cull will go ahead within the next few weeks,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2>Monday</h2> <h2>Masters Of Money<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>In the final part of this timely series, BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders urges us to shrug off our shackles and storm the barricades. Or at least asks us to consider whether Karl Marx had a point. The 19th-century German intellectual, of course, argued that while capitalism needed to be swept away, it would collapse by itself in any case. Flanders wonders whether his theories might provide answers to the mess we're now in \u2013 and also attempts to separate his economic analysis from atrocities committed in his name. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Monroe<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>James Nesbitt's brain surgeon/miracle worker/purveyor of witty one-liners returns for a new series of the medical drama. There's a new boss at St Matthews and Bremner (the deadpan Sarah Parish) is back from maternity leave. Monroe, as ever, has a lot of dilemmas that make him stare into a glass of red wine and raise one eyebrow thoughtfully. First up is a young man with a brain condition other doctors deem too risky to operate on \u2013 will Monroe <br>give him a chance under the scalpel? At home, his ex-wife has a new boyfriend and his son unleashes some controversial news. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Hotel GB<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>It's difficult enough to imagine potential viewers \u2013 not to mention participants \u2013 steeling themselves for yet another iteration of the fish-out-of-water reality format.The conceit this time is that some of Channel 4's best-known facces will pretend to staff the titular hotel \u2013 Gordon Ramsay running the restaurant, Mary Portas stewarding the rooms, Kirstie Allsopp serving as concierge, etc. The veneer of higher purpose will also be applied, in the form of training for job-seekers. Andrew Mueller</p> <h2>Threesome<br>9.30pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>The affable comedy returns for its second series bolstered by a new cast of sitcom heavyweights, with Bill Bailey, Robert Webb and The Inbetweeners' Joe Thomas all lining up to appear. Now that baby Lily has been born, Mitch is going back to school for his maths GCSE so he can start a teacher training course. But there's a whole new world of slang, bullying and a surname easily turned into Penis to deal with. The jokes are never subtle, but there's something about the titular Threesome that's likable enough to make it work. <em>Rebecca Nicholson</em></p> <h2>My Brother, The Murderer<br>10.05pm, More4</h2> <p>This wonderfully touching but strangely truncated 30-minute film follows 30-year-old Natasha Owen Jones, a woman who has spent two decades searching for a brother she has never met. Her brother Morgan was adopted before she was born. Natasha was also later adopted and, while she stayed in the UK, he was taken to the US by his new family. Last year, she finally found him, only to discover that he is serving a 99-year sentence for first degree murder in a Minnesota prison. She travels to the US where she meets Morgan for the first time. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>George H W Bush<br>10.15pm, PBS</h2> <p>Part of a series of documentaries on American presidents, this examination of the ex-CIA director turned national leader advances the suggestion that having taken the low road to power, he was governed by his conscience while in the White House. Some would splutter in incredulity at that, and wonder what there is to say about this morally inert suit-filler other than that he was marginally less appalling than his son. This documentary, however, reveals a complex and contradictory man, whose single term as president between 1988 and 1992 was historically momentous.

First up it's crackers, then teacakes \u2013 marshmallowy Tunnock's-style ones, rather than those hot-cross buns without the cross. Brendan is eerily calm as always: \"He's just a machine, look at him,\" mutters John trying to catch a glimpse of his circuit board. Tempering chocolate in a clammy tent, building Buckingham Palace out of gingerbread, there is nothing these bravehearts won't try to win that title. Nutmeggy joy. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>The Paradise<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Continuing the adaptation of Zola's novel now set in \"England's first department store\", and the staff are still trying to win the admiration of their Wonka-like employer John Moray. A tougher sale is the show's odd tone of period social realism and unmoored fantasy. This week Sam reveals that behind his sales floor patter lurks a ladies' man, while Denise tries to generate publicity for the store with a competition to find a radiant lady to wear one of the shop's promotional flowers: \"Miss Paradise Pinks\". No one would blame you if you kept the receipt. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip \u2013 An Emotional History Of Britain<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Over three episodes Hislop explores Britain's national character, beginning with how we became known for having a \"stiff upper lip\". Once upon a time, the English (the focus here) were actually known for their displays of emotion \u2013 during the 18th century a cult of sensibility made expressive feeling fashionable for men and women. However, there was also the restraining attitude of politeness, which was to pave the way for a more stoic outlook. As usual, Hislop tells his story in a jaunty style, using lively and \u2013 at times \u2013 unlikely anecdotes. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Cuckoo<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>Ken (gigantic stand-up Greg Davies) holds a meeting to set out a few ground rules now that Cuckoo (SNL alumnus Andy Samberg), his new surprise son-in-law, has nestled himself into the family home. Meanwhile, the family gets set for a \"welcome home\" party for daughter Rachel, where she plans to unveil her tool of a new husband to her friends. Happily, this second episode suggests that there's more legs to this sitcom than merely the mockery of insufferable new age chump-wits, with Davies doing the beleaguered partriarch bit some justice. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Lillyhammer<br>10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>When this show aired in Norway it was watched by 1/5 of the entire population. It's not going to get such a huge viewership over here, but it's worth noting that it wasn't just Norwegian national pride at play \u2013 this really is something funny and unique. Giovanni is still sticking out like the sorest thumb imaginable: apart from his continual habit of speaking heavily Brooklyn-accented English while all around him speak Norwegian, his attempts at not making any waves have resulted in him getting girlfriend Sigrid pregnant. The Scandinavian medical system proves a foe no wiseguy is prepared to tackle. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>House Of Lies<br>10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Based on Martin Kihn's bestseller, House Of Lies is a smart Don Cheadle-starring US comedy drama with hints of Hustle about it. Part-expos\u00e9 of the dark arts of consultancy, part-Robin Hood vengeance fantasy, it sees Cheadle and his firm of besuited gunslingers concoct scams designed to fleece the 1% whose chicanery plunged America into economic ruin, beginning with fictional megabank Metro Capital. Lots of meta, fourth wall-breaching addresses to camera from Cheadle, if only to explain some of the consultancy terminology. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348831613283/Mrs-Biggs-010.jpg\" alt=\"Mrs Biggs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheridan Smith stars in Mrs Biggs, ITV1.

That's a lot of people. In this new three-part series, we see how the locals are using all their ingenuity \"to carve out a home, and build their future\", whether by turning their dwellings into a pub (while avoiding eviction by the local council), or by literally transforming dirt into gold: in an eye-popping sequence, a pair of would-be alchemists turn street sweepings into bling, with the addition of nitric acid and mercury. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Mrs Biggs<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>Sheridan Smith's charming portrayal of Mrs Ronnie Biggs concludes with Charmian adapting to life as a single mother in Melbourne. But when a family tragedy strikes, she has a rethink about what she's doing with her life. While she and the boys are pining for Ronnie, he's working as a roofer and living the high life in Rio. And when he finds out that one of his Brazilian lovers is pregnant, he realises he may have the right to remain in the country legally. Ronnie becomes nothing short of punchable when long-suffering Charmian flies in for a visit. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>One of the most divisive figures in a truly polarising decade for comedy, Kenny Everett was nevertheless an 80s superstar, his shrill-voiced, button-pushing schtick proving a hit with viewers. He was also, as the cliche goes with comics, a \"complex character\", and thus worthy of the warts-and-all treatment meted out to the likes of Kenneth Williams. Here Oliver Lansley (Whites) is tasked with channelling Everett's lively spirit, in a bio-drama that shines a light on his closeted homosexuality and battles with the moral decency brigade. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>Body Of Proof<br>9pm, 5USA</h2> <p>Dr Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) is Quincy in killer heels. A former neurosurgeon married to the job, she lost her licence after a car crash numbed her fingers and she killed someone on the operating table. Now she's a fast-talking Philly medical examiner, a genius who doesn't do things by the book, desperate to get back into her estranged daughter's life. Watching Body Of Proof is the TV equivalent of cooking in mittens, all fat-fingered exposition and fumbled cliches. So, not entirely surprisingly, it's also pretty watchable. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Perception<br>9pm, Watch</h2> <p>You have to feel sorry for the few crimefighters in US dramas that don't have help from uniquely-skilled eccentric masterminds. Luckily for FBI agent Kate Moretti (Rachael Leigh Cook) she has the option of calling on paranoid schizophrenic professor of neuroscience Dr Daniel Pierce (Eric McCormack). In this debut, Moretti and Pierce investigate the death of a pharmaceutical executive \u2013 along with the hallucinations Pierce's subconscious tends to conjure up. It remains to be seen whether the concept remains fresh, but for now file under \"entertaining romp\". <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348831922974/Wartime-Farm-010.jpg\" alt=\"Wartime Farm\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Lumber Jills' Jo Mason and Tracy Anderson in Wartime Farm, BBC2 Photograph: Laura Rawlinson/Lion Television/BBC/Laura Rawlinson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Rawlinson/Lion Television/BBC/Laura Rawlinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wartime Farm<br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It's 1942 and things are tougher than ever for Britain's farmers. Three years of the German blockade have taken their toll and there are shortages of wood, animal feed and fuel. Every scrap of land is turned over to food production \u2013 including parks in London \u2013 while \"Lumber Jills\" are deployed by the Women's Timber Corps to fell trees and \"Bevin Boys\" are sent to coal mines instead of the front. On the farm, Peter converts an ambulance to run on coal gas, while Ruth sets up a food centre for those bombed out of their homes. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Created by X-Files pensmith Frank Spotnitz and produced by the team behind Spooks, big things are expected from Hunted. Luckily, this opening episode doesn't disappoint, hitting the ground running with assassins, hostages and shootouts from the off. Taking place in the world of industrial espionage, Sam Hunter (Melissa George) finds herself back in active service after a botched mission, while trying to uncover just who betrayed her. While we might not see as action-packed a sequence as the opening scene every week, it's safe to say Hunted is far more than just Bourne on a BBC budget. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>Homefront<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>This drama series about the wives left behind as their menfolk serve in Afghanistan continues to show promise, without as yet exploring the politics of the conflict - though aspects are bubbling underneath. This week, Louise is incensed when she receives a photo of her hubby, back on leave, in a clinch with a female squaddie, which he insists has been photoshopped. Meanwhile, Paula and Tasha, mother and wife of the slain Matt, continue to lock horns. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>First Presidential Debate<br>9pm, PBS</h2> <p>Though President Obama may have the edge in recent polls, the 2012 election is still proving tight. Republican candidate Mitt Romney has led a weak campaign, littered with gaffes. Obama will hope to exploit those flaws and no doubt be keen to claim the 47% of Americans that Romney has apparently disowned, but he has to contend with poor job numbers and a struggling economy. The first of three debates took place last night, and is reshown in full here. It focuses on domestic policy, and is held in the swing state of Colorado. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>The Judy Garland Show<br>9pm, Sky Arts 2</h2> <p>Repeat showings of the screen legend's 1960s variety series co-hosted by comedian Jerry Van Dyke and including an appearance from her then-ingenue daughter Liza Minnelli. Like most US shows of that era, everyone is overly polite and awkward but it's enjoyable for the nostalgia-paddling in the company of legendary performers like Tony Bennett, Ethel Merman and Peggy Lee. And poignant too to see a fortysomething Garland on the downward slope. Tonight she welcomes former co-star Mickey Rooney and they duet up a storm. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9.40pm, Dave</h2> <p>Following the 2009 Back To Earth specials, Rimmer, Lister, Cat and Kryten return for a six-part series of new adventures. If that smacks of trying to reinvigorate a franchise best left back in the 20th century, the first, largely moose-gag powered scenes here may give further cause for concern, being just not funny. Gradually, though, things improve as the boys explore an abandoned ship and comic timing reasserts itself. Patchy, but the idea of Rimmer crashing on account of \"self-created malware\" powered by his own resentments suggests that some of the old magic may still be there. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348832140212/Strictly-Come-Dancing-010.jpg\" alt=\"Strictly Come Dancing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strictly Come Dancing, Friday night, BBC1, 9pm.

Once more, Tess and Methuselah will be presiding over the cha-cha-cha, as Len, Bruno, Craig, and a new face - the one and only Darcey Bussell - offer \"constructive\" criticism during the first of this weekend's two live shows. Would-be hoofers include Victoria Pendleton, Jerry Hall, Johnny Ball and Sid Owen. There's no elimination this week, so they can all rest easy. For now. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Servants: The True Story Of Life Below the Stairs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>\"You can't get the help these days\" is a phrase which well described the state of domestic service in Edwardian England, where increasing industrial opportunities for the working classes resulted in numbers of those working in service dropping by around 5,000 a year. In the second part of Dr Pamela Cox's exploration of service, she finds that things downstairs were changing. It was the poorest in society who were drafted in to make up numbers, pulled out of the workhouses, taught household skills, and then whisked off into servitude for middle- and upper-class families. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>QI<br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>If there's a winning quality to QI, it's that you can never quite tell who's going to be any good at its blend of wit, recondite knowledge and public house esoterica. It was wonderful, for example, to watch Bill Bailey triumph and Jimmy Carr tank utterly a couple of weeks ago. At times it can seem like a bit of a boys' club, it's true \u2013 but tonight comic Sarah Millican continues to hone her mainstream chops, while other contestants include Mr Victoria Coren, David Mitchell, and the former 80s pop star turned broadcasting vicar Rev Richard Coles. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Leeds International Piano Competition 2012: Finalists Story<br>7.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>This year's contest has been run and won by 24-year-old Italian Federico Colli. This is another chance to hear one of the finalists he defeated, 26-year-old Australian Jayson Gillham. Gillham \u2013 who has won several other prizes, including 2011's Brant International Piano Competition and this year's Royal Overseas League Music Competition \u2013 performs Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5 in E-flat major. Also included: a brief history of the grand piano. Suzy Klein presents. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Modern Family<br>8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>First in the fourth season of the madly popular US sitcom. Jay's hoping his birthday will pass without mention but his nightmarish family have other ideas. Ideas to do with fishing, and boats, and potential drowning. And will Gloria choose this happy day to drop her pregnancy bomb on the birthday boy? Meanwhile, Mitchell and Cameron struggle for emotional buoyancy after a failed adoption bid and decide to get a cat. Pity the cat. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Moone Boy<br>9.30pm, Sky1</h2> <p>It's confirmation time for Martin Moone, and he has something of an epiphany during the service: he wants to be one of those cool altar boys. Once he's accepted into the gang, he discovers there's nothing sweet and innocent about his priest-terrorising new friends. Martin soon gets to the top of his profession and gets to serve on Holy Thursday, so starts a strict training regime to make sure he's the best altar boy ever. But when his sister Fidelma joins the choir his parents can't help but wonder what they did wrong to make <br>half their children devout church-goers. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2012, because the preview of the BBC4 programme Leeds International Piano Competition 2012: Finalists Story originally said defeated finalist Jayson Gillham \"performs Beethoven's fifth symphony, the opening bars of which are pretty much the classical world's equivalent of Smoke On The Water\". It was Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5 in E-flat major that Gillham performed.</p>",
  "<p>The public sector has long been leading the pack when it comes to cutting energy costs and carbon emissions. One of the major drivers put in place by government to encourage local action was a framework of national indicators, which required local authorities to take responsibility for cutting carbon from their own estate. Councils were tasked with reducing per capita CO2 in their areas, reducing fuel poverty and even adapting to climate change.</p> <p>Recent legislation changes have seen this framework scrapped, replaced instead by a voluntary memorandum of understanding between government and the <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Local Government Association</a>, and a revision of the Nottingham declaration known as climate local.</p> <p>This change in the regulatory environment has happened in parallel with funding cuts for local authorities, meaning that the business case for carbon reduction has to shout louder to be heard.</p> <p>Despite these changes, the need to take action remains very strong. The financial opportunity for councils is particularly compelling \u2013 rising energy prices mean that the potential savings get larger every year. These savings alone should make public sector finance directors sit up and listen.</p> <p>Since 2001, <a href=\"http://www.carbontrust.com/home\" title=\"\">the Carbon Trust</a> has worked with more than 3,000 public sector bodies, providing them with advice and carbon management services. As a result, these organisations have reported actual savings to date of \u00a3640m, with potential future savings of \u00a32.6bn. Energy costs are being cut, liberating resources for frontline services.</p> <p>The wider impact on local areas and the economy should not be overlooked. The <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Committee on Climate Change</a> recently highlighted the critical role that local authorities have in cutting emissions because of their influence over local buildings, surface transport and waste (which together account for 40% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions).</p> <p>Emissions from these sectors can be cut by 20% by 2020, compared to 2010 levels, and 30% compared to 1990 \u2013 but only if local authorities develop serious, workable, low-carbon plans.</p> <p>There are indications that cutting carbon is slipping down the agenda. The <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/\" title=\"\"> Department for Energy and Climate Change </a>released statistics last week showing that 97% of local authorities reported a rise in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010, compared with 2009, and while this may be related to the weather (2010 was colder than 2009 in the UK), it does highlight the need for action.</p> <p>However, a few local authorities are taking their ambition even further. In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.durham.gov.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Durham county council</a> set a target of cutting emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2020, but have since upped that goal to 47%. This is equivalent to taking almost 300,000 cars off the road, or putting cavity and loft insulation in more than 750,000 homes.</p> <p>Through their building and transport planning responsibilities, local authorities have an exciting opportunity to lead on the development of healthier, more efficient urban systems. They can pioneer the production of low-carbon, local energy with district heating, waste to energy, combined heat and power, and renewables.</p> <p>Through their school and housing stewardship responsibilities, they can catalyse the development of better learning and living environments, lower fuel poverty, and more sustainable schools.

The government's \"<a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/tackling/green_deal/green_deal.aspx\">green deal</a>\", which begins on Monday, aims to plug the gaps in 14m of Britain's leaky homes, making them cosier, cheaper to heat and producing less climate-heating carbon emissions. Yet severe doubts are swirling around the programme like a bitter winter wind, some even whipped up by the government's own analyses.</p> <p>If the immediate prospects look bleak, Ed Davey, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, sees better weather ahead: \"It will be a gradual roll out because it is a new market: we should be looking ahead two, three, four, five years.\" Perhaps ministers' desire to focus on the future is why the green deal launch is set to be quieter than mouse buried under three feet of insulation.</p> <p>It does not lack for ambition being, not just new, but entirely uncharted territory. \"It's an experiment that has never been tested before,\" said Oxford University's Jan Rosenow. \"It may work, but there is a high chance it will not.\"</p> <p>The current subsidies and legal obligations on energy companies to help people insulate their homes are being bulldozed away and a new approach, built on private-sector loans, is being developed on its foundations. The benefit of this is that it paves a way to accessing the many billions of pounds that will be needed to fund the country's great green transformation. The risk is, that if these private deals are not attractive enough to persuade millions of people to open their doors and lofts to the builders, the grand plan will crumble to rubble.</p> <p>The winds of doubt have not had to search hard for gaps in the green deal to whistle through. The government's own impact assessment - even after revision - shows that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/11/green-deal-policy-floundering\">loft and cavity insulations are set to plummet</a> by 83% and 67% respectively after the green deal starts.</p> <p>Andrew Warren, director of the <a href=\"http://www.ukace.org/\">Association for the Conservation of Energy</a>, explains: \"We are moving from a period where people were offered basic insulation at zero cost into a brave new world where you pay the full amount and a full interest rate on top.\"</p> <p>This predicted collapse in the cheapest and most effective energy efficiency measures means that the carbon emissions savings from newly-insulated homes are also set to plunge by 75%, according to Rosenow. His <a href=\"http://eng.janrosenow.com/uploads/4/7/1/2/4712328/rosenow-eyre-2012-the-green-deal-and-the-energy-company-obligation_.pdf\">new study</a>, with colleague Nick Eyre, lists another serious concern: \"The current proposals indicate that fewer resources will be directed to address fuel poverty than under existing policies, making eliminating fuel poverty even less plausible.\" Add to these the umpteen technical problems arising from setting up a new, national personal finance scheme and accrediting a whole new industry of supplier and installers and the uncertainty reaches gale force.</p> <p>Yet ministers are not running for the storm shelters yet. They argue radical action was needed in order to deliver more expensive efficiency measures, such as solid-wall insulation, and argue that loft and cavity wall insulation now save money so quickly for homeowners that no subsidy should be needed.</p> <p>So which way is the wind blowing for the green deal? Much will depend on the shelter afforded by government giveaways aimed at pulling in early adopters. This will involve \u00a3<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/24/treasury-200-million-green-deal\">200m of cashback</a> and ministers believe they can deliver council tax rebates too. Without good incentives, Rosenow said the take up will not be anywhere near the government's hopes and he doubts those revealed so far are enough to rescue the policy.</p> <p>Warren acknowledges that the government's own data predict a \"dire flop\", but is more optimistic. If the right incentives are in place, it is a completely different picture, he said.</p> <p>\"In the long run the green deal is a model which really should work, though what does concern me is the transition,\" Warren said. \"Ministers right across the government think this is a major policy and say they will make it work, and we've never had that before for energy efficiency.\"</p> <p>But David Kennedy, chief executive of the government's official advisors, the Committee on climate change, has warned: \"We think there is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/20/green-deal-fail\">significant risk in leaving it to the market</a>, as that has never worked anywhere in the world and is unlikely to happen in the UK.\"</p> <p>The green deal matters. If successful, it could deal with the severe and pressing problem of soaring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/energy\">energy bills</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/fuel-poverty\">fuel poverty</a>, while making a huge contribution to the UK's efforts to avert dangerous climate change. But will it work? The answer, for now, is blowing in the wind.</p>",
  "<p>Over the next 50 months, we need to grow a capital markets framework that enables finance to be deployed at speed and scale behind the low-carbon transition. The investor demand is there: institutions with assets in excess $20 trillion (\u00a312tn) called for global policy action at last year's Durban climate conference, up from $13tn at the 2009 Copenhagen summit. And in spite of the dark clouds of economic depression, a number of indicators are moving in the right direction. The costs of key clean technologies, such as LED lighting and solar power, continue to fall, while high and volatile commodity prices provide a powerful impetus for resource efficiency. But capital remains scarce and concerns are growing that new financial regulations such as Basel III and Solvency II could have the unintended consequence of discouraging long-term finance for environmental infrastructure. Furthermore, the excitement generated by green stimulus plans in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis has given way to a mood of green austerity.</p> <p>It's no secret what needs to happen. Capital will flow if there is investment-grade policy in place: clear and enforceable short-, medium- and long-term targets with effective incentives (and removal of disincentives such as fossil fuel subsidies). Smart public finance is also critical, marrying heightened ambition with cost-effectiveness, recognising that public funds are scarce and need to work harder to mobilise individual savers, institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds. This means getting much better at spreading best practice across borders. In the first half of 2012 alone, Germany's public finance arm, KfW, allocated \u20ac12.1bn to climate and the environment, offering powerful lessons to the UK's emerging green investment bank. Growing investor interest in low-carbon infrastructure could also be met at the margin by fiscal support to buy-down construction risks for investors through loan guarantees or the credit enhancement of project bonds. And in terms of focal areas, the top priority must be energy efficiency where global progress has lagged that of renewables on the supply side. Here, the UK could become a world leader in energy efficiency financing if it gets the green deal right, constructing a smooth conveyor belt between residential renovation and the bond portfolios of ISAs and pension funds. Finally, extra action to promote low-carbon investment will also need to be matched by efforts to recognise the risks of high carbon assets in investment portfolios. Environmental costs need to be fully integrated into capital expenditure plans for new coal, oil and gas reserves if the threat of stranded assets is to be avoided as the low-carbon economy takes shape.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.hsbc.com/1/2/newsroom/news/2007/hsbc-hires-specialist-to-head-up-new-climate-change-centre-of-excellence\" title=\"\">Nick Robins</a> is HSBC's head of Climate Change Centre of Excellence</p>",
  "<p>Taking up this invitation to draw lessons from my 16 years as chief executive of <a href=\"http://scouts.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Scout Association</a> is fraught with dangers. There is the risk of appearing to lecture those in other voluntary organisations who know far more, or for claiming personal credit for successes which very much belong to a wider team. And, as it is another six months before I actually leave, there is plenty of time for anything I say to come back to haunt me.</p> <p>So let me start on safe ground by saying I've never been more convinced of the need for strong, active voluntary organisations or confident about their contribution to civil society. And add that, through all my years in the voluntary sector, I have been constantly inspired by the energy, enthusiasm and commitment I've seen and amazed at what it achieves.</p> <p>Volunteering moves mountains. As just one example, organising the World Scout Jamboree in 2007 when 32,000 young people from across the globe descended on the UK would have been a massive challenge for any organisation, let alone one made up almost solely of people volunteering in their spare time. Just like at the Olympics this summer, volunteers led the way and 8,000 adults from around the world built and maintained a safe place for young people to live and work together and created inter-cultural understanding for the summer. This success, like anything else we have achieved, was due to their efforts, and it is played out each week in local communities across the country.</p> <p>But it is up to those of us who are full-time to help create the environment where these talents can flourish and to ensure our organisations are meeting current needs. Fifteen years ago we were not convinced that The Scout Association was fully meeting either of these challenges. Scouting remained strong but membership and impact were in gradual decline. Young people appeared to doubt whether what we offered was relevant or, to be honest, attractive. Our membership was not representative of Britain. We were finding difficulty in recruiting and retaining adult volunteers.</p> <p>Our collective response was to examine every aspect of our organisation, what we did and offered, and to draw up a co-ordinated long-term plan to tackle weaknesses and gaps. We found, fortunately, that the values and core of Scouting were still important and relevant but that we needed to respond better to the modern lives, concerns and ambitions of young people. So we devised a youth-work curriculum which was innovative, creative and attractive to youngsters from all backgrounds.</p> <p>It was a thorough overhaul of activities and how we presented ourselves, including our uniform which had remained pretty much untouched for thirty years, as well as moving many of our resources online and now more recently into digital formats.</p> <p>For adult volunteers, instead of insisting on a one-size-fits-all training programme which took weekends to complete, we fitted training around the skills, competencies and experience they already had. Any gaps could be filled in the evening, in modules and even online. We took the decision, too, to be confident in telling our story, putting resources into profile and brand building and better communications.</p> <p>It would be nice to say these changes instantly produced results or were immediately popular. But that wasn't the case. Our membership continued to decline for a few more years before gaining traction. We were told at the time that our founder would be spinning in his grave at some of the changes. But the naysayers were wrong.</p> <p>Gradually, we reduced the rate of decline, then by 2006, and thanks to the efforts of a great many people, the changes started to produce visible results. Membership has now steadily grown for seven successive years. Female membership is strongly up, and the number of older teenagers has more than doubled. We have more than 50 scouting groups for Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs although this is an area where there is still more to do. In their communities, Scouts make a difference.</p> <p>We are what we always believed we were: an organisation whose values and sense of adventure appeal to everyone. Scouting is proving so popular that we have 35,000 young people on our waiting lists across the UK. We are now more confident and ready, if necessary, to face controversy if we believe what we are doing is right.</p> <p>So what have the last 16 years taught me? First, the value of patience: real and lasting change in a large voluntary organisation is a culture-shift, and that takes time. Second, to maintain focus on vision, and actively resist mission-drift whether from the lure of pet-projects of others or from the temptation of short-term funding streams. And third, to value the teamwork that allows people to share their successes with \"we did this together\".</p> <p>You have to have confidence in what you are doing and ensure that this confidence is shared by your colleagues, both the volunteers and the professional staff. It is crucial to involve them in developing strategies and plans, to keep them motivated, encouraged and supported.</p> <p>We have been fortunate. Our experience is that there is still a strong desire among adults to be involved in scouting. The number of adult volunteers has risen by 10% in the past seven years. But in a world in which working nine to five is long dead, we have to find new ways to allow them to give their time flexibly. Getting this right will be among the main challenges on my successor's job-list.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>England is missing a trick by not introducing a charge on carrier bags and there is no excuse for procrastination, according to the minister who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/30/welsh-traders-shoppers-bag-charge\" title=\"\">introduced a 5p charge in Wales a year ago</a>.</p> <p>The remarks from Welsh environment minister, John Griffiths, come as figures released on Monday show the Welsh charge has raised more than \u00a3800,000 for charities including the RSPB and Keep Wales Tidy.</p> <p>The position of Westminster's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is that it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/21/england-carrier-bag-charge-poll?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"monitoring the results of the charging scheme in Wales\"</a> before it consults on a similar charge for England.</p> <p>But Griffiths told the Guardian: \"I think we've got the evidence. It's been quite clear it's been a resounding success, and delivered on all the expected outcomes: far less litter in our streets and countryside, behavioural change and public support.\"</p> <p>He said there was no excuse for procrastinating on introducing a charge in England, which he felt was missing a trick on \"a practical measure that is tried and tested \u2026 and is relatively straightforward to do\".</p> <p>\"I can see no reason why the charge wouldn't work just as well in other parts of the UK,\" he added, in a statement.</p> <p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/04/plastic-bag-use-5p-charge\" title=\"\">supermarkets in Wales reported</a> reductions of 70-96% in single-use plastic and paper bags since the charge \u2013 which goes to charities and is not a tax - was introduced in October 2011.
