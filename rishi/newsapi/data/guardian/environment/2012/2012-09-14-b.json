  "<p>Caryl Churchill's new play has 57 scenes, runs 110 minutes and employs 16 actors to play more than 100 characters. Too much information?</p> <p>But one of the many points made by this exhilarating theatrical kaleidoscope is that we live in a world where information bombardment is in danger of leading to atrophy of memory, erosion of privacy and decay of feeling.</p> <p>What is extraordinary about Churchill is her capacity as a dramatist to go on reinventing the wheel. All her plays, from Owners to A Number and Far Away, are formal experiments, and on this occasion she has come up with something that feels like an intimate revue written by Wittgenstein.</p> <p>Occasionally, as in a cryptic sketch about a woman flummoxed by a multilingual waiter who knows endless words for \"table\", it is very funny. But what I detect in Churchill is a deep sense of political and personal unease about a society in which speed of communication replaces human connections.</p> <p>That is manifested in scenes showing we don't always know how to cope with the information available.</p> <p>In Climate, a woman expresses her fear of the impact of global catastrophe on future generations while her mother blithely hangs lights on a Christmas tree.</p> <p>In Earthquake, set in a noisy cocktail bar, a man registers his horror at a recent tsunami to a woman for whom it is simply a series of TV images.</p> <p>Both scenes, like all of Churchill's 57 varieties, gain immeasurably in power from the way James Macdonald's production gives them a specific social context.</p> <p>But Churchill deals with the private as well as the public consequences of living in a dizzyingly changing world. The mordantly funny Virtual depicts a couple on exercise bikes, the man proclaiming of his feminine ideal that \"she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she understands me\" only to reveal that he's talking about a computer.</p> <p>This doesn't mean Churchill's play is some attack on technology: she is saying that we have to be its master rather than its slave and learn how to how to live with the cascade of fact and opinion.</p> <p>Churchill's play, in short, is a humanist document that, in Macdonald's dazzling production, makes vivid use of theatre's technical resources.</p> <p>Miriam Buether's white-walled chamber set which opens and closes like a camera shutter, Christopher Shutt's variegated sound design and Laura Draper's stage management ensure that one scene follows another with lightning speed.</p> <p>And, in a large cast, Amanda Drew, Linda Bassett, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Justin Salinger and Paul Jesson, are among those who make a decisive impact. Each spectator will have a different vision of what this defiantly nonlinear show is really about.</p> <p>For me, Churchill suggests, with compassionate urgency, that our insatiable appetite for knowledge needs to be informed by our capacity for love.</p> <p><em>Until 13 October.

  "<h2>Celia Pacquola, London</h2> <p>Australian stand-up Celia Pacquola has got considerable mileage out of her struggles to cope with unusual challenges. She's talked about her attempts to come to terms with a failed marriage to a serial philanderer; produced a whole show detailing how she mastered the wildly complex keyboard solo to I'm So Excited by the Pointer Sisters; and, more recently, she's faced the challenge of adapting to life in the UK. This kind of fish-out-of-water humour is a path well-trodden by other expat comedians, but Pacquola brings something new. Rather than rolling her eyes at our excesses, she greets everything with a mix of optimism and curiosity, sort of like an antipodean Josie Long, but where the scholarly stuff is replaced by pure ditziness. Fortunately, the relentless perkiness never gets wearing, as it's accompanied by strong gags and insights into what makes us tick.</p> <p><em>Comedy At The Rosendale, SE21, Sun</em></p> <h2>James Acaster, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396098065\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347540926052/James-Acaster-008.jpg\" alt=\"James Acaster\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Ed Moore</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Moore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Acaster's comedy is a gloriously funny shambles. Firmly avoiding anything that looks like showbiz glitz or well-honed stagecraft, he makes it look as though he's just wandered on to the stage without a clue about what he's going to say. But all this is subterfuge: underneath the gawky movements and air of distracted befuddlement lies one of the sharpest comic minds to have emerged in recent years. Particularly appealing is the way he tells it like it is about the young male experience. Where loads of blokey comics will tell you exaggerated stories of their antics on big nights out and the hilarious things they got up to, Acaster's great at communicating the mundane boredom of much of twentysomething life. He'll tell you tales where virtually nothing happens, or where tiny non-events are relentlessly over-analysed by him and his friends. It's a version of life that feels much more real than the beery anecdotes of excess peddled elsewhere, and it's won Acaster considerable acclaim, including a recent Edinburgh comedy awards nomination.</p> <p><em>99 Club, WC2, Sun</em></p> <h2>Simon Evans: Friendly Fire, Tunbridge Wells</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396098066\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347540961496/Simon-Evans-008.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Evans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Evans</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two years into Cameron and Clegg's marriage of convenience, and you'd have thought that we'd be fed up of being told what to think by posh blokes with loud, braying voices. However, Simon Evans is one toff who is worth paying attention to. Like fellow comics Will Smith (the one from The Thick Of It, not The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air), and Hal Cruttenden, Evans wears his upper-crust breeding on his bespoke-tailored sleeve. His assumed air of social superiority affords him the perfect vantage point to sneer hilariously at all sorts of contemporary phenomena, from footballers to politicians. All this is accompanied by a faintly old-fashioned style of delivery, heavy on polish and showmanship, that makes the well-crafted punchlines ring out all the more impressively. While he may not present himself as the most likable of characters at the best of times, you'll find yourself warming to his deliberately elitist, never-less-than-hilarious view of the world. Laugh-out-loud stuff.</p> <p><em>Trinity Theatre, Thu</em></p>",

The thing is, it doesn't really matter who Otto Knows is. Otto Knows could be a dog on a skateboard in a funny hat for all the difference it makes. All that really matters for the six-minute duration of this jubilant electro-anthem is the mantra: \"EH EH EH EH EH AH AH AH AH AH DA DA DA<strong> </strong>DA DA DA DA DA DA DA\".

Say Nothing almost has everything: boyband \"whoahhh\" bits, a romantic-history-as-egg-preference metaphor (\"we used to have our eggs sunny side up\" \u2013 so poignant), a portion where everything drops out and a chorus slams in \u2026 The only thing missing, really, is crowd noise.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDq_8bRMgKA\" title=\"\"><strong>No Doubt</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Settle Down (Interscope)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>No Doubt's first new material in a decade doesn't stray far from the tune a fantastic robot might make with information gleaned from No Doubt fans, focus-grouped to within an inch of their lives on what they fancy from a new No Doubt single. But it's hard to begrudge The Doubt their moment of comeback glory when Settle Down boasts lyrics as exquisite as \"been around the block before, doesn't matter any more\" or portions of melody that so closely recall Paris Hilton's winsome pop masterpiece Stars Are Blind.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6yCy1upT64\" title=\"\"><strong>Pitbull feat Shakira</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Get It Started (RCA)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>This latest horse dung deposit in the pop dual carriageway marks business as usual from global pop's reigning king of the self-aggrandising non-sequitur: \"Big news,\" he belches. \"Pitbull, Tom Cruise, Mumbai, all lit up like a December night. Like the 4th Of July, Vanilla Sky. Thriller in Manila \u2026\" And so it continues. Two-thirds of the way through it actually starts to feel as if this song might never end, but end it does. The only real consolation here is that having experienced Get It Started, one knows that this week's Pitbull moment has now been and gone. Think of this as a controlled explosion.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eiq9xbSiWgY\" title=\"\"><strong>Michael Jackson feat Pitbull</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Bad (Remix) (Epic) </strong>\u2026</h2> <p>Except nobody is safe.

As it is, fans offended by this remix can now at least find a positive in Jackson's death, knowing as we do that Michael will never hear what has been done to his song. As with most cases of grizzly murder it feels irresponsible to go into too much detail about the precise nature of Pitbull's emotionless assault, but the listening experience is much as you might expect: you try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it.</p>",

  "<p>\"It horrifies me to say this,\" says Sean Hughes, \"but my dad came to see a show I did years ago and fell asleep due to drunkenness.\" The relationship between father and son wasn't cosy \u2013 \"We used to high-five each other in the middle ground of self-hatred,\" he says. But nearly two years after Sean senior died of leukaemia, aged 72, the comedian is tackling his father's illness and death head-on, through his new stage show, Life Becomes Noises.</p> <p>\"Just don't use the C-word,\" he says, hunched over a coffee in a cafe, his face fuller in middle age.</p> <p>The C-word? \"Cathartic,\" he says.</p> <p>Hughes, who was the youngest winner of the Perrier award for comedy in 1990, rates this show as his best work. \"I feel I'm doing something good.\"</p> <p>He says he has his father to thank for this new vitality. \"I've said before that my father never gave me any support, but there was a weird rough justice in him dying. He gave me the inspiration to write this show, against his will, and it made me grow up. It pushed me towards the next phase of my life. If there is a 'presence', I just hope he knows he's been extremely helpful, because I think he'd have been proud of what I've done. I find that a solace.\"</p> <p>Hughes's father was a driving instructor \u2013 at a time when drink-driving wasn't illegal, he points out. He was also keen on the horses and Hughes makes his stage entrance dressed as a jockey. Surely his father wasn't hoping he'd take up racing as a career? \"He would have been delighted. He didn't want much in life.\"</p> <p>This was the result, he assumes, of his father's own thwarted ambitions \u2013 disappointments later masked by drink. That generation didn't analyse their lives in the way Hughes's own north London neighbours might these days. \"It wasn't a thing you did, especially in a working-class environment, so he muddled along.\"</p> <p>The show, which combines laugh-out-loud humour, world-weary indignation and poignant anecdotes is set between his father's hospital bed and the family hearth in Dublin. Hughes zig-zags through his feelings about healthcare for the terminally ill, his family dynamics and whether we take death too seriously.</p> <p>He started thinking about writing it on the way home from his father's funeral. No sentimentality was his first rule. He showed the script to his two brothers, aware that his version of events wasn't necessarily theirs. \"I was a bit sheepish \u2026 my younger brother, Martin, found it very hard to read but was aware that I'd taken poetic licence. My older brother, Alan, was a bit taken aback \u2013 positively so. I'm so glad they didn't go, 'You can't say that.'\"</p> <p>He didn't consult his mother. \"She wouldn't understand and I don't want to hurt her. What I do is an alien world to her and she'd be wondering why I'm saying those things about our family to other people. Of course, I'm terribly disappointed \u2013 I'd love my mum to be the biggest champion of [my work], but I accepted years ago that it wasn't going to happen.</p> <p>\"I harboured a lot of resentment in my youth. I had no support when I was going into a creative career. I had a part-time job in a supermarket and my mum and dad would have been delighted if they'd given me a full-time job. That was their ambition for me. That hurts. They weren't being hurtful but it made me quite hard towards them, which was probably unfair.</p> <p>\"One reason I haven't got children is that I'm too selfish, but I think each generation looks to their parents' faults to make them better people.\"</p> <p>Hughes was born in London but the family moved back to Dublin when he was six, where he was sent to a new school at the height of the Troubles sporting the provocative combination of a bow-tie and a Cockney accent. \"Dad's best joke \u2026 I looked and sounded like Tommy Steele.\"</p> <p>Hughes left for England at the earliest opportunity, after which, he says, \"we weren't very good on the phone\".</p> <p>He has tried to avoid being mawkish in writing about his father. \"A few comics have talked about their fathers dying and they've been tributes. It doesn't ring true to me. I wanted it to be more deep, and real. Things weren't great, but let's celebrate that. There are positives to be taken out of traumas.\"</p> <p>Our attitude to death is too serious, he says. \"It should be more like seeing someone off on a great adventure. But there are too many set rules. The priest saying the words doesn't really know the person. They should be beautiful occasions and they are not.\"</p> <p>He wonders why the doctors couldn't have made it clear that his dad wouldn't get better. \"He was too old and weak to survive, but they don't tell you that. I guess it's the whole Catholic thing of miracles, that you could get better, which is bullshit. And when you look at the shitty bed they die on \u2026 It sounds flippant when I say cancer wards should be jolly. But they should be like children's wards. There should be colours, not dark shapes.\"</p> <p>Sometimes major events are life-changing for a while, then you revert to type, says Hughes, who was caught up in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,,1380679,00.html\" title=\"\">2004 tsunami, in Sri Lanka</a>. \"I'm lucky to be alive \u2013 but it changes you for two days, then you're back watching Neighbours at lunchtime.</p> <p>\"My philosophy is that you can't force change. I matured very late in life. The idea of not drinking five years ago would have been alien to me. I was blocking things out with drink. You realise that when you're dealing with a death you can't block it out. But you have to come to all these places on your own. Once you realise that, you become a more rounded person.\"</p> <p>Being thrust into grief has lowered his expectations of life without admitting defeat, which he says is a good thing. It has made him more generous \u2013 up to a point. \"As you get older, you want more quality time and that means putting yourself out. I try not to be so judgmental, to show people more love. I can't give you a list. It's a general state. Having said that, I'm probably still too controlling \u2026 and I don't suffer fools. I got that from my father. That will never change.\"</p> <p>Marriage and children are not on his agenda: \"I like to be on my own. I can deal with that.\"</p> <p>Hughes is able to distance himself from the personal content of the show \u2013 which received warm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/aug/13/sean-hughes-edinburgh-comedy-review\" title=\"reviews\">reviews</a> on its Edinburgh Fringe debut run \u2013 and see it as an acting job. \"It's not necessarily about my father any more. It's about how it affects the audience. If you're telling the truth, you're pretty much telling everyone's truth.</p> <p>\"The reaction I wanted was the same reaction that I had after I saw Death of a Salesman. I wanted people to go out and cherish their relationships.\"</p> <p>Over the year before his father's death, Hughes and his father reached an accommodation. \"If I look at it coldly, if someone's not going to get better, I'd rather they died quickly. But that time allowed us not to fix our relationship but to amend it. They were quite cherished times. It was kind of beautiful when I used to do insignificant things with him \u2013 go to the shops, get some bread, you know \u2026\"</p> <p>He checks himself. \"I'm not going to romanticise it. It wasn't like running through a field of daisies.\"</p> <p>To illustrate his point, he recalls a trip to Kilmainham Gaol museum in Dublin, where leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising were executed by the British. \"My parents lived in a self-imposed Catholic prison so what I tried to do near the end was take them out. I love history and Kilmainham is amazing. I was delighted that my dad was having a good time and asked if he was enjoying himself. He went: 'Yeah, but your brother Alan would have enjoyed it more because he likes history.'</p> <p>\"He didn't say it to be mean-spirited but it was cutting. I just went, 'That's a real shame that you said that.' But when I was younger, I would have gone, 'Fuck you, then.'\"</p> <p>It may be a cliche but Hughes \u2013 now 46, and a non-smoking, vegetarian teetotaller \u2013 admits that the process of losing his father has changed him. He would get drunk to sit at his bedside and tell him how he felt, or to warn his father that news about his recovery prospects would one day be negative.</p> <p>Gradually, it dawned on him that it was kinder to be less brutally honest. Towards the end, when his father asked, \"Nothing's going to happen to me, is it?\", he was able to say no, to make his father feel safe.</p> <p>\"He wasn't a brilliant man but he did make me feel safe and I should have respected him more for that. That was my way of thanking him, telling him 'I love you' because I didn't say it enough.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Life Becomes Noises tour starts in Durham on 2 October.

  "<p>Eddie Grapper is the Sherpa Tenzing of the O2. He's a mountaineer and climber and he's got the beard to prove it. He used to work in advertising but tired of coming up with pithy straplines and decided to devote the rest of his life to craggy peaks, perilous ledges \u2013 and managing Up at the O2.</p> <p>\"I'll be honest,\" I tell him, staring upwards, \"all I know about climbing is based on watching Touching the Void and reading The Ascent of Rum Doodle. And in both cases, climbing does not end well.\"</p> <p>Eddie nods sagely. \"Well,\" he proffers, \"we've all climbed the wrong mountain.\"</p> <p>I stare up towards the vastness of the O2. Am I about to climb the \"wrong mountain\"?</p> <p>Up at the O2 opened this summer. It's a continuous walkway that takes you over the roof of the old Millennium Dome. The highest I've ever dared climb was a four-foot stepladder and that ended in tears.</p> <p>\"Climbing,\" Eddie tells me, \"is about the intangible and the ineffable. It's about a connection with your environment. You need a spirit of adventure.\"</p> <p>\"I've got that,\" I chip in.</p> <p>\"A willingness to explore new things.\"</p> <p>\"Check.\"</p> <p>\"You need to want to see what the world looks like from the top of something.\"</p> <p>\"Ummm.\"</p> <p>\"And you need a tremendous amount of physical strength.\"</p> <p>I blink. \"Eddie,\" I confess, \"I have the upper body strength of a daddy-longlegs. And I hate heights.\"</p> <p>He stares back at me. \"We got a wheelchair up there this morning. We get everyone up and over, whatever their fitness level. I've had pensioners in their 80s do it. You'll be fine.\"</p> <p>This challenge isn't quite what I've been expecting. I've spent the past few days fretting as to how I am going to grapple my way up the side of a building, but the setup is ingenious. I'm kitted into a jumpsuit, snapped into a safety harness and then, after a short climb up a perfectly normal set of stairs, find myself at base camp, the starting point of the climb.</p> <p>\"Vertigo can kick in,\" I'm told. \"But trust in your safety harness. The worst that can happen to you is that you fall to your knees. And you will always be the same distance above the roof. That can be a comfort.\"</p> <p>I stare upwards. The walkway is like a stretched, ridged trampoline with a wire running up its centre. It's very steep but the good news is that after the first 20m, the walkway gradually flattens out in increments until you hit the centre. All the same, the emotion I'm feeling isn't comfort. It's more gnarled terror mixed with the fear of a suddenly loose bowel.</p> <p>I'm clipped onto the wire and told that I must, at all times, keep one hand on my safety clip. It has to remain in the \"smiley face\" position in order for me to move and, from the off, I find this quite tricky, mostly because all I want to do is hold on to the central wire with both hands and make noises like a wounded goose.</p> <p>However, the fact I have to concentrate so hard on maintaining the smiley face clip position means I have no time to think about how I am shimmying up the side of a very large building and before I know it, I've reached the first peak.</p> <p>\"Don't forget to look around,\" says our guide, Tom, who is lovely.</p> <p>I can't quite do that yet but I'm determined to conquer my revolting fear of heights and, at some point, take both hands off the wire and the clip and do a proper Chris Bonington hands-on-hips grin.</p> <p>The climb, I'm discovering, is more akin to a fairly strenuous walk. The early upwards sections are tough on the calves, but the higher we go, the easier it becomes. There's a certain amount of bounce to the walkway that takes a little getting used to and I wish I'd worn a slightly sturdier shoe, but as we approach the summit, dare I say it, I am actually enjoying myself.</p> <p>There's a large observation deck at the top and I am overwhelmed with a sense of achievement. \"I have climbed atop,\" I cry. \"I have stood aloft and I can declare I was here!\"</p> <p>\"Yes, you can,\" says Tom, smiling.</p> <p>I have conquered the grand peak of the O2 and if I can do it, so can you.

  "<p>Scrambling up on the rocky outcrop was not easy. The stones were loose and crumbling, the bushes thick and unyielding. Most of all, I was alone. I kept telling myself that: I'm alone on a 4,000m mountain plateau in the heart of Africa, and I have wandered off the path.</p> <p>At the top, I sat down on a flat rock and enjoyed the spectacular view across the Aberdare national park. The sky was a miraculous deep blue, broken only by the silhouette of an Augur buzzard cruising along some invisible air current. I scanned the grasslands below: no elephants or lions to be seen.</p> <p>For many years, most tourism in Africa has had a very simple arc: you drive in a 4x4, bouncing up a track, then sit and watch a group of animals. Then you do it again. It is a model that evolved out of the colonial-era hunting experience, the guns being replaced with cameras (though not entirely \u2013 big game hunting is still going on).</p> <p>But Africa is changing, and fast. Old ways are being dropped. And nowhere more so than in Kenya, a country with double-digit economic growth and an expanding population with rising economic expectations. Change has also come to the Aberdares, a mountain massif 50 miles north of Nairobi. In particular there are new campsites and nature trails that allow visitors to do what was previously unthinkable: walk for several days across a reserve where lions, elephants and buffalo roam. For anyone who has known the sheltered world of guides and 4x4s, this is a revolution.</p> <p>I was in the Aberdares as part of a team making a film about urgent botanical work going on in Kenya, but I was determined to sample the delights of walking through the bush. Fortunately, in the higher altitudes of the range, the more dangerous animals are very rarely seen; they prefer to stay in the forests below. I had left the team rhapsodising over some strange tiny plants in a mountain stream and taken off along the ridge, heading south. There was a clear path, but I had found the lookout hill irresistible.</p> <p>Although the primary draw of Kenya is almost always its wildlife, in the Aberdares the plant life runs it a close second. East Africa has a handful of isolated high-altitude ranges, including Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and Mount Eldoret. On each of these a unique vegetation has evolved to cope with blistering daytime sun and freezing night-time temperatures.</p> <p>That evolutionary challenge has resulted in some bizarre and wonderful creations: four-metre-tall groundsel trees whose leaves ooze an anti-freeze solution, and shaggy lobelia trees standing like Easter Island statues in the grassy slopes. With global temperatures rising, these giants are retreating up the mountains and are now on the very tops, with nowhere to go. Only the previous day we had stopped our Land Rover a short distance below the summit to collect seed from a type of wild tomato, a species only discovered a year before but already endangered. With an estimated one-in-four plant species now threatened with extinction, this environment is at the front line of the battle to save genetic material that could be vital to agriculture and medicine.</p> <p>I left my secluded mountaintop and clambered back down to the path, then wandered on into a sunny dell where the giant groundsels were clustered together. In Europe, the plant is a common weed and these trees had an oddly familiar look. It was like walking through my own untended allotment after eating the wrong kind of mushrooms.</p> <p>The path reached a ridge line and for the next hour I had magnificent views all the way to Mount Kenya, 50 miles away. When Europeans first saw this peak it was a snow-capped wonder, but now there was no sign of ice at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396242936\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347468007673/The-Fisherman-s-Lodge-is--001.jpg\" alt=\"The Fisherman\u2019s Lodge is one of only two lodges in Aberdare park\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fisherman\u2019s Lodge is one of only two lodges in Aberdare park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That night I rejoined the film team to sleep at Fisherman's Lodge, one of only two lodges within the Aberdares. It's a pair of sturdy cottages with broad verandas, a living room with large fireplace, a couple of spacious bedrooms and a caretaker-cum-cook, Francis. You can book these places independently and drive yourself through the park, though you'll need room for an armed wildlife scout to accompany you through the lower forested areas, where elephant and leopard roam. Having said that, dealing with the Kenya Wildlife Service can be like negotiating with the Ottoman Empire on a bank holiday. Phones and emails are, in my experience, answered only very patchily. We organised our trip at the local KWS office in Nyeri, the nearest town to the Aberdares. Another possibility is to use a trekking company in Nairobi.</p> <p>At sunset, a small group of reedbuck came gently towards the cabins to drink from the dripping outside tap and to pass the night close to humans, who offer a modicum of protection from predators. There is also a campsite nearby. When I checked it out the reedbuck were there too, grazing quietly, and a grey duiker, a small, secretive deer, bolted away.</p> <p>As night fell, we marvelled at the tranquility and the stars, listened to a distant lion roar, then the yelping cry of a hyena. Then, as the fire crackled and the whisky went down, our botanists, Paul Kirika and Tim Pearce, together with deputy game warden Mwangi, who had come up to see us, reminisced about close encounters in the bush. Apparently there's nothing tranquil about being a botanist in Kenya: elephants charging, snakes suddenly appearing, and always the big danger, the rogue male buffalo, most feared of the animals because of his irascible, short-sighted aggression.</p> <p>One of the scouts up on the Aberdares had been chased, had fallen over, and the buffalo had charged right over him: he miraculously survived with no more than cuts and bruises. As Mwangi reminded us, however, it is the humans who represent the real threat. With its populations of rhinos and elephants, the park is a draw for professional poaching gangs, a resurgent menace all over Africa.</p> <p>Next morning I walked with Tim, taking the trail out of Fisherman's Lodge down through some bushes and across the stream. The air was cold and there were crusts of shining ice in the shadows. Once you are on foot in Africa, animals become far more elusive and difficult to spot, though any encounter you do manage is far more exciting than from a vehicle.</p> <p>A brace of white-faced vultures flapped away from the rosewood trees; a pair of waterbuck snorted and trotted off. Misty green light came dancing through the lichens that festooned the trees. Tim had his head down, magnifying lens in hand, absorbed in the tiny worlds of seed and leaf. In the mud behind him, very clear and large, was a fresh leopard print.</p> <p>Mwangi came up the track after us with a scout carrying a rifle.</p> <p>We made a steep descent to a stream and searched for the simple footbridge. \"When the Britishers came, they put trout in these rivers and built the lodge.\"</p> <p>\"Can you still fish here?\"</p> <p>\"There are places to fish \u2013 people do eat the trout.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396242937\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347467940181/Sykes--monkeys-are-common-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sykes\u2019 monkeys are common in Aberdare national park\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sykes monkeys are common in Aberdare national park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of these upland Kenyan areas must have reminded those old colonials of northern Britain: the moorland and the dark rushing streams. At Embu, a small town on the slopes of Mount Kenya, there's even a lovely hotel called the Izaak Walton, after the 17th-century English pioneer of angling writing.</p> <p>We dropped down to a stretch of moorland, stopping to watch some distant buffalo. \"Isn't it dangerous?\" I asked Mwangi, \"to let hikers wander around?\"</p> <p>He shook his head. \"The trail is marked and carefully designed to keep to safe areas.\"</p> <p>For the rest of the day, however, Mwangi complained about our bad luck at not seeing elephants.</p> <p>\"It's great to see them when you are on foot, but of course you must be very careful and never approach too close.\"</p> <p>We spotted giant forest hogs, rare animals only discovered in 1904. This is surprising since they are so huge: males weigh in at a quarter of a tonne. There were warthogs, buffalo and monkeys, too, but no elephants. Reluctantly, on our last night, we had to pack our bags in the Land Rover and descend from the clouds to the world below.</p> <p>The Aberdares, however, had one more surprise for us. Rattling along the track, we slowed to let a bush hare cross. There was a wild swishing in the trees, a brief and sudden trumpeting, then a group of five elephants were dashing across too, their trunks high and waving wildly. For once, I had to admit, it was good to be inside a vehicle.</p>",
  "<p>In 1902, the caustic American satirist <a href=\"http://www.ambrosebierce.org/\" title=\"\">Ambrose Bierce</a> \u2013 who once reviewed a book by observing that its covers were \"too far apart\" \u2013 proposed a&#xa0;new social convention. Modern life, he complained, involved being introduced to far too many people: you'd meet a friend in the street, then a friend of <em>his </em>would stroll by, and before you knew it you'd have a new, unasked-for acquaintance, with all the obligations that entailed. Bierce blamed the democratic spirit of the 20th century: in the older, more formal days, stricter rules governed who could form acquaintanceships with whom. \"It is to be wished,\" Bierce wrote, \"that some great social force, say a billionaire, would set up a system of disintroductions.\" He imagined a generous gent, a&#xa0;Mr White, resolving to disintroduce two friends of his, Mr Black and Mr Green. \"Mr Black,\" he might say, \"knowing the low esteem in which you&#xa0;hold each other, I have the honour to disintroduce you from Mr Green.\" Mr Black (bowing): \"Sir, I have long desired your unacquaintance.\" Mr Green: \"Charmed to unmeet you, sir.\" Mr White: \"I'm sure you will become very good strangers.\"</p> <p>It's probably best, for Bierce's sake, that he never lived to see <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=15610312130\" title=\"\">Facebook's People You May Know.</a> Ever since the widespread adoption of email in the 1990s, in fact, the phenomenon he bemoaned has reached a scale he could never have imagined. Technology exposes us to vastly more opportunities for making social connections, and far more effortlessly than even a stroll down the street and a handshake. Yet an etiquette for terminating those links, should they outlive their mutual benefit \u2013 if they ever had any \u2013 remains as absent as ever. Even \"unfriending\" someone on Facebook, the closest equivalent to Bierce's proposal, feels like delivering a slap in the face (and not even a well-timed slap, since you can't be sure when they'll find out). Facebook itself hates unfriending, for commercial reasons, and thus makes it easy to hide updates from tiresome contacts without their knowing \u2013 a deeply unsatisfactory arrangement that leaves you at constant risk of meeting someone face-to-face who assumes you must already know they've got engaged, or had another baby, or been dumped, or fired, or widowed.</p> <p>The result \u2013 at least for anyone who can still recall friendship before the social media age \u2013 can be an awkward hodgepodge. There are Facebook friends with whom you want to share everything, those you've grown apart from, and those you've barely heard of. (You can assign them to different lists, but then you've introduced a whole new layer of decisions: who belongs where? What qualifies someone to be switched from one list to another? And so on.) There are Twitter followers with whom your acquaintance is strictly professional, those you know from school, but didn't necessarily like, and those who are your dad. Not long ago, I realised, with a feeling of dismay, that I'd started to think of some of these contacts \u2013 not most of them, but some \u2013 as clutter.</p> <p>If that sounds a heartless way to think about other people, consider the parallels. Physical clutter, as a widespread problem, is only as old as modern consumerism: before the availability of cheap gadgets, clothes and self-assembly furniture, it wasn't an option for most people to accumulate basements full of unwanted exercise bikes, games consoles or broken Ikea bookshelves. We think we want this stuff, but, once it becomes clutter, it exerts a subtle psychological tug. It weighs us down. The notion of purging it begins to strike as us appealing, and dumping all the crap into bin bags feels like a liberation. \"Friend clutter\", likewise, accumulates because it's effortless to accumulate it: before the internet, the only bonds you'd retain were the ones you actively cultivated, by travel or letter-writing or phone calls, or those with the handful of people you saw every day. Friend clutter exerts a similar psychological pull. The difference, as Bierce understood, comes with the decluttering part: exercise bikes and PlayStations don't get offended when you get rid of them. People do. So we let the clutter accumulate.</p> <p>Or most of us do. Last year, a writer of romance novels from Illinois named <a href=\"http://arlynnpresser.com/\" title=\"\">ArLynn Presser</a> embarked upon what you might call an audit of her so-called friends \u2013 the social equivalent of picking up each old gadget and scrutinising it, before keeping it or throwing it out. She was recently divorced, and her adult children had left home \u2013 \"If your kids don't call you a lot, that's a&#xa0;sign you've done a good job,\" she told me \u2013 and she was spending hours every day on Facebook. \"I was keeping up with everybody's news, noticing what they were doing, staying up to date, and I&#xa0;began to think, 'Seriously though, who <em>are </em>these people? If&#xa0;I was in college with you, and we weren't particularly good friends then \u2013 why are you suddenly someone I message back and forth with at least once a day?'\" Politeness, she knew, was the reason she'd accepted some of her online friends: \"Say someone sends a request and you look at your mutual friends and you wonder, 'Wait \u2013 were you the person I was talking to at that wedding?' You don't want to ask, 'How, exactly, do I know you, and why would I want to be your friend?'\" Presser had 325 Facebook friends, a little money stashed away, and a fear of flying that she wanted to overcome, so she decided to combine all three: she made a New Year's resolution to visit them all, to find out why \u2013 or, indeed, whether \u2013 they were friends.</p> <p>\"I don't think I realised,\" Presser says, \"that it was going to be quite as big a deal as it was.\"</p> <p>To recognise that friend clutter is a problem, it should be emphasised, doesn't mean condemning online friendship per se. It's commonplace, these days, to encounter the concern that social media might be making us lonelier \u2013 that online bonds can't be as fulfilling as \"real-life\" ones. The sociologist Sherry Turkle, author of the recent book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780465010219\" title=\"\">Alone Together</a>, worries that \"we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection. Email, Twitter, Facebook, all of these have their places\u2026 but no matter how valuable, they do not substitute for conversation.\" One frequently cited statistic, based on research among Americans, is that between 1985 and 2004 the number of people who said they didn't have a single \"confidant\" \u2013 someone to whom they could talk about anything \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30038995?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101038109423\" title=\"\">rose from 10% to 25%</a>. A further 20% had only one such person. It might seem hard to avoid the conclusion that all the time we spend online, superficially connected but in a more profound sense isolated, must be to blame.</p> <p>Except that, according to an ever-growing body of evidence, social media <em>isn't</em> making us lonelier or less deeply connected. Instead, study after study endorses the idea of \"media multiplexity\": people who communicate lots via one medium, it&#xa0;turns out, are the kind of people who communicate lots via others as well. <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2006/The-Strength-of-Internet-Ties/01-Summary-of-Findings.aspx\" title=\"\">Regular emailers are more likely also to be regular telephoners</a>, one study found; people who use Facebook multiple times a day, according to another investigation, have <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Technology-and-social-networks/Part-3/SNS-users.aspx\" title=\"\">9% more close ties in their overall social network, on average, than those who don't</a>. Social media builds social capital, rather than degrading it: regular users of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, one major survey last year concluded, <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Technology-and-social-networks/Summary.aspx\" title=\"\">are 43% more likely to vote</a>. Even that chilling statistic about more Americans lacking a confidant now looks dubious: a new analysis by the sociologist <a href=\"http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.3/claude_s_fischer_loneliness_facebook.php\" title=\"\">Claude&#xa0;Fischer</a> <a href=\"http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/america-is-not-getting-lonlier/\" title=\"\">concluded that the finding arose because of a change in how the questions were asked</a>. There's little other evidence to suggest that more people are feeling lonelier. Which makes it tricky to maintain that the new modes of friendship are&#xa0;eroding friendship itself.</p> <p>None of this means that friendship isn't being transformed by social media, though. It's just that the problems aren't those of isolation \u2013 of the replacement of face\u2011to\u2011face contact with screen-gazing in darkened rooms \u2013 but those of scale. The anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar famously calculated \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/14/my-bright-idea-robin-dunbar\" title=\"\">Dunbar's number</a>\" \u2013 the notion that the largest number of meaningful social relationships that any one person can maintain is somewhere around 150. Before the internet, we kept things manageable by natural attrition: if there were people you didn't want to see any more, then by and large you didn't see them. \"It's unnatural for us to drag all our past relationships with us into our future, as we do with Facebook,\" says Anjali Mullany, social media editor of <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/\" title=\"\">Fast Company</a> and writer of its \"social media agony aunt\" column. \"That's not how things have worked, in terms of friendship, for thousands of years.\"</p> <p>Online networks have a tendency to obliterate the nuances between different kinds of relationships. Despite Facebook's lists, privacy settings and the rest, Mullany points out, \"ultimately, somebody is either your friend on Facebook or they're not. In real life, we're very political about our friendships, and I don't mean that in a bad way.\" There are friendships we'll let fade to nothing; others for which we'll put on a&#xa0;facade for a few hours at Christmas; or friendships of necessity, where we'll give the impression of intimacy without the reality. In contrast, \"Facebook essentially doesn't allow us to be political.\" Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, makes no secret of his belief that everybody sharing everything with everybody else would be Facebook's ideal state. (The site's more nuanced levels of user control are provided, his statements imply, only as a grudging concession to old\u2011fashioned attitudes that will soon die out.) It's no coincidence, of course, that maximal sharing means maximally lucrative opportunities for advertising. But this flattening of relationships is unlike anything we've called \"friendship\" before.</p> <p>When Presser set out to meet her Facebook friends, one of the first things she discovered was that about two dozen of them had no intention of letting her visit, which certainly answered the question of what kind of friends they were. More revelations were in store. Some people proved overly demanding, such as the woman with whom she'd grown up and who had moved to a&#xa0;remote part of Turkey \u2013 she said Presser could visit so long as she brought her a Mac computer and a printer. When Presser offered to help her have the equipment shipped instead, she says, she found herself unfriended. Then there was the childhood acquaintance with whom, Presser realised, she'd stayed Facebook friends mainly to&#xa0;avoid giving the impression that she had a&#xa0;problem with his having undergone gender reassignment surgery to become a&#xa0;woman. But when they met, they still didn't get along: \"I&#xa0;didn't like her any more than I had done as a&#xa0;child.\" Another Facebook friend, whom she visited in Boston, seemed friendly enough: they went to a yoga class together and said warm goodbyes at the airport. Waiting for her flight, Presser blogged about the yoga class in a slightly facetious manner. \"By the time I got off the plane,\" she recalls, \"I'd been defriended and blocked.\"</p> <p>Presser is at pains to point out that her expedition, which she plans to use as the basis for a&#xa0;book, was a largely positive experience. In a&#xa0;remote corner of Alaska, she rekindled an old friendship; near Beachy Head, she was served a&#xa0;splendid Sunday dinner by people she'd never met; again and again, she was moved by the generosity of people \"who, after all, hadn't signed up to my resolution\". But her year of friend\u2011auditing was clarifying, too. The realisation that she didn't have much in common with certain Facebook \"friends\" meant they no longer needed to weigh on her mind; she could focus on the other ones instead.</p> <p>Not that it would be accurate to give the impression that Presser reduced her number of Facebook friends. Mentally, she had decluttered. But thanks to the publicity her quest attracted in the US media \u2013 and her seeming inability to decline new requests \u2013 her friend count stands at 5,000. Facebook won't let her add more.</p> <p>The more profound truth behind friend clutter may be that, as a general rule, we don't handle endings well. \"Our culture seems to applaud the spirit, promise and gumption of beginnings,\" writes the sociologist <a href=\"http://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/faculty-detail/?fc=440&amp;flt=l&amp;sub=all\" title=\"\">Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot</a> in her absorbing new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Exit-Endings-That-Free-Lawrence-Lightfoot/dp/B008LXBEG2/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347362178&amp;sr=1-2-catcorr\" title=\"\">Exit: The Endings That Set Us Free</a>, whereas \"our exits are often ignored or invisible\". We celebrate the new \u2013 marriages, homes, work projects \u2013 but \"there is little appreciation or applause when we decide (or it is decided for us) that it's time to move on\". We need \"a language for leave-taking\", Lawrence-Lightfoot argues, and not just for funerals. A&#xa0;terminated friendship, after all, needn't necessarily signal a horrifying defeat, to be expunged from memory. One might just as easily think of it as \"completed\".</p> <p>Mullany recommends a friend-decluttering exercise that she admits sounds \"weird\", but that she predicts will become more and more widely accepted. She advises making a public proclamation on Facebook in which you specify the criteria by which you'll henceforth be defining people as \"friends\". Maybe you'll resolve only to remain Facebook friends with people you've met at least once in real life, or maybe you'll use a&#xa0;stricter standard, such as whether you'd invite that person to your wedding. Explain, in the same proclamation, that the consequent defriending shouldn't be taken personally, and that you're doing it to a number of people at once. Then start clearing out the clutter. Increasingly, Mullany argues, social media will force us to evaluate our friendships in this way \u2013 to take stock of our connections, so as to reserve our energies for those who matter most. She equates this to drawing up the guest list for a wedding: \"It's stressful but, for many people, making that list is a really important, meaningful moment.\"</p> <p>A person involved in the music industry whom I'll call Andrew \u2013 because telling you his real identity would defeat all his efforts to manage his online presence \u2013 recalls the moment he realised he'd need two Twitter profiles: one for his public existence and one for his actual friends. (The problem is somewhat different on Twitter, since followers don't need to be approved.) \"You forget that there's an audience,\" he says. \"I'd be saying something to a friend, and then someone I&#xa0;didn't know would chip in, furiously angry about what I'd&#xa0;said. I thought, 'I can't be fucking bothered with this.' It was like dragging a&#xa0;busload of people behind you wherever you went.\" Andrew left Facebook for similar reasons. \"Somebody I'd been at school with when I was 10 sent me a message to say, 'Are you still really into Adam And The Ants?' Of course I'm not. I'm in my 40s, and we knew each other when we were 10.\"</p> <p>If Zuckerberg's insistence that everyone should be friends with everyone prompts us, out of necessity, to winnow our lists to a smaller group of people we truly cherish, he'll have done something admirable, even if it's the opposite of what he intended.</p> <p>And what of Bierce, who was longing for a new convention of disintroductions as long ago as 1902? He handled his own exits unconventionally, to say the least. In 1913, at the age of 71, he took off for Mexico, telling friends he wanted to witness the revolution underway there. Some time later, he is supposed to have written, in a letter to a&#xa0;friend, \"I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination\", though the letter has never been found. Then he vanished. There were rumours \u2013 one involved his execution by a Mexican firing squad \u2013 but nothing was ever confirmed. Gradually, it began to dawn on Bierce's friends that, one way or another, he'd disintroduced himself from them all.</p>",
  "<p>In 1993 I became the first woman to win the Whitbread Prize, and it changed my life. Money! One winner blew it all on a swimming pool for the family's French villa. Not me.

One of the best things about Booker's new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/11/booker-prize-2012-shorlist-mantel-self\" title=\"\">shortlist</a> is that, for the first time, independents in publishing have claimed four out of the six places. Independent publishers were on their way out when I won the Whitbread nearly two decades ago \u2013 my publisher was an independent called <a href=\"http://www.carltonbooks.co.uk/imprints/andredeutsch\" title=\"\">Andre Deutsch</a> \u2013 and the Booker list indicates that they're regaining ground.</p> <p>Not a trend likely to catch Whitbread/Costa's fancy these days. Costa is strong-arming its multinational way into&#xa0;small towns and villages all over Britain and plonking down its identical coffee shops even though local people in&#xa0;overwhelming numbers \u2013 from Southwold in East Anglia to Cottingham&#xa0;in Yorkshire to Totnes in Devon \u2013 make it clear <a href=\"http://www.thisishullandeastriding.co.uk/Row-brewing-approval-Costa-coffee-shop-Cottingham/story-16854743-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">they aren't wanted</a>.</p> <p>I lived in Totnes for 30 years, and&#xa0;Totnes outdid itself. Three quarters of its population <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/totnes-war-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">protested against</a> Costa: Totnes already has more than 40&#xa0;independent coffee shops. That many people agreeing on anything approaches a miracle, a landslide of public opinion. Costa isn't bothered. It&#xa0;hasn't bothered with the populations of other protesting towns either. But isn't this supposed to be a democracy? Here's a corporate giant flouting the fully expressed will&#xa0;of local people. And for what? To boost a profit margin that'll go to build more coffee shops in Russia and Egypt \u2013 Costa's <a href=\"http://www.hospitality-jobs-dubai.com/costa-coffee\" title=\"\">largest is in Dubai</a> \u2013 at the expense of UK shopkeepers.</p> <p>Corporate juggernauts mowing down local communities is a part of modern life. Powerful, ubiquitous international brands that are convenient and familiar but dull as hell: that same smell, that same taste, that same plasticky look and feel. This kind of commerce has nothing to do with the lives of people except to chew them up and spit them out. A literary prize is just camouflage, and that's wrong.</p> <p>The worst part of it is that Whitbread/Costa isn't the only commercially funded literary prize. The UK has one of the richest literary heritages in the world, and its major literary prizes are out there to flog everything but books. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/orange-prize-for-fiction\" title=\"\">The Orange Prize</a>? Telephones. Except that the telephones <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/22/orange-withdraws-sponsorship-prize-fiction\" title=\"\">have pulled out</a> and&#xa0;the prize is up for grabs. Apple is showing some interest. One fruit to another, just like beer to coffee: one beverage to another. Man Booker? First a set of grocers, Booker McConnell. Then an investor got in, Man. Which brought some serious money. One can only thank the Lord that investors are sensible enough to realise that, grocers or no, the name was perfect, and they kept it. Besides, everybody knows that changing the brand name devalues the brand itself</p> <p>But why does Great Britain have to&#xa0;sell its literature under a brand name in&#xa0;the first place? Canada has the <a href=\"http://www.canadacouncil.ca/prizes/ggla/\" title=\"\">Governor General's Literary Awards</a>.

  "<p>Which anniversary will you be celebrating this weekend? Saturday marks four years since the collapse of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\" title=\"\">Lehman Brothers</a>, the moment that has come to symbolise the great crash of 2008. Thursday was the fifth anniversary of the day queues formed outside branches of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northern-rock\" title=\"\">Northern Rock</a>, the start of the run on the bank that announced the credit crunch. And on Sunday it will be 20 years since Black Wednesday, when UK interest rates leapt from 10% to 15% and Britain&#xa0;crashed out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. When it comes to commemorating financial disaster, we're positively spoiled for choice.</p> <p>When the Rock cracked and Lehmans fell over, we thought we were dealing with a banking crisis. The immediate fear was that the cashpoint machines would run dry. How modest, quaint even, a mere credit crunch seems now. We now know that panic in the banks rapidly triggered a collapse in the real economy, in people's jobs, livelihoods and lives. Britain is in a double-dip recession; US unemployment has remained above 8% for nearly four years; in Spain, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/may/16/youth-unemployment-europe-oecd\" title=\"\">one in two young people are without work</a> and in Greece the only growth industry is the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/greek-election-blog-2012/2012/jun/15/greek-crisis-humanitarianism-charity-desmos\" title=\"\">soup kitchen</a>. By comparison, 16 September 1992 was rather a bright Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\" title=\"\">inaugurating a period of UK&#xa0;growth that lasted 16 years</a>.</p> <p>The trouble now is that while we face&#xa0;a global economic crisis, our politics remains stubbornly national. It may even be the 21st-century condition: the&#xa0;greatest threats \u2013 economic and environmental \u2013 are supra-national, yet&#xa0;our weapons, forged in the 19th century, are small, hopelessly confined to national boundaries. (The EU has supra-national ambitions but is constantly thwarted by&#xa0;national realities.)</p> <p>This has limited our perspective on the economic crisis in two serious ways. The first relates to the project that defines this government: austerity. The coalition says the deficit is the root of the problem and therefore slashing it must be the top priority. Labour follows Keynes in insisting that deficit-cutting is indeed important, but that the very last time to do it is during a recession: wait till the economy has recovered, otherwise you make a sick patient sicker.</p> <p>But this argument goes on as if we inhabited an economic island, which we do not. Austerity might just about make sense if Britain were enduring hard times alone. But it cannot work when our neighbours are suffering too: if they also cut back, they won't buy our goods or put money in our pockets. I'm told President Obama's former economic adviser Larry Summers compares the national pursuit of austerity to students leaving a lecture theatre. One can slip out early causing no harm. But if everyone tries to leave at the same time, there's a stampede, no one gets out and some get crushed. In other words, we have to take the rest of the world into account.</p> <p>But if we're missing the global dimension of the supposed remedy, we might also be missing the global nature of the disease. The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has repeatedly said the deep cause of our current woe is that <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2011/speech473.pdf\" title=\"\">the global economy is out of balance</a>, that it is unsustainably lopsided with, for example, the likes of Germany and China selling more than they buy \u2013 leaving them as surplus nations \u2013 while the US, Britain and others buy more than they sell, racking up massive debts as they continue spending (whether on expensive health and welfare systems or consumer goods). The debtor countries can't pay their bills and the surplus countries lack customers well off enough to buy the stuff they produce. The result is the current mess.</p> <p>For proof, look no further than the eurozone, where the imbalance between, say, Greece, Italy and Spain on one hand and Germany on the other is so stark. One key policymaker tends to scare visitors by suggesting there are only four ways to bring southern and northern Europe into alignment. One: usher in mass unemployment in the south, leading to a steep fall in wages and prices that would make those countries' exports cheaper and more competitive. Two: push up wages and prices in Germany and across northern Europe, so that high inflation erodes their competitive advantage. Three: give up on balance and resign yourself to a future of permanent cash transfers from the rich north to the poor south. Or four: break up the euro and allow those struggling countries to do what Britain has, in effect, done since 2008, devaluing their currency, making their exports more affordable.</p> <p>It doesn't sound like much of a choice. But some options are more unpalatable than others. The notion of tightening the squeeze yet further on Greece and Spain is surely politically impossible, whatever the economics. The Spanish will not hesitate to take to&#xa0;the streets: note the 1.5 million Catalans, one fifth of the population, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/13/catalonia-million-march?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">who came out this week to demand&#xa0;independence</a>.</p> <p>More realistic is to let Germany pursue growth even if that means high wages and a mild rise in inflation. The country can cope. Indeed, German workers missed out during the fat years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/aug/08/number-one-problem-economy-europe\" title=\"\">their wages falling by 4% in real terms in the noughties</a>. They're due a raise. If there needs to be a differential between south and north in order to restore southern competitiveness, this way is surely better than driving poor nations deeper into penury.</p> <p>By the same token, China needs to let its currency appreciate in value rather than keeping it artificially low. Who has the authority to lean on the Chinese or the Germans, pushing them towards the action the global economy needs them to take? The international architecture of the postwar Bretton Woods era collapsed long ago. Now we have endless summits that merely buy time for the next summit. We live, says analyst Ian Bremmer, not in the age of the G20 or even the G8, but the <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/67339/ian-bremmer-and-nouriel-roubini/a-g-zero-world#\" title=\"\">G-Zero</a>. There is a void at the top.</p> <p>That could be a counsel for despair, but we can't afford it to be. Whatever their other faults, both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were consistently energetic players in those global meetings: Brown was crucial to the success of the emergency G20 in April 2009. By contrast, David Cameron and George Osborne turn up as mere onlookers, even as they repeatedly argue that Britain's economic woes are deepened by, if not the fault of, the crisis beyond our shores. If that's true, it is no excuse. It is a demand for action.</p> <p><em>Twitter:</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em> @j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The high aspirations were indisputable and the fine words unmistakable. \"Our new government has a particular and historic responsibility to rebuild confidence in our political system,\" David Cameron wrote in his<a href=\" http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/ministerial-code-may-2010.pdf\" title=\"\"> introduction to the ministerial code</a> within days of taking office in 2010. \"After the scandals of recent years, people have lost faith in politics and politicians. It is our duty to restore their trust. It is not enough simply to make a difference. We must <em>be</em> different.\"</p> <p>But how different? Halfway through the current parliament the words are beginning to sound hollow. Once upon a time the new prime minister seemed to get it. The new coalition government had come to power in the wake of a massively damaging MPs' expenses scandal, a cliquish government under Labour, and with memories of the damage done by the sleaze of the 1990s still vivid within the Tory party. Mr Cameron's bold words undoubtedly spoke for the new mood of May 2010 \u2013 a chance to refresh the democratic process and rebuild trust in politics generally. It was right to want to be different. But did they really mean it?</p> <p>It is increasingly difficult to remain confident about that after recent revelations about the conduct of senior ministers in the Cameron government and after observing the way Mr Cameron has reacted to them. The Guardian's stories about the new Tory party chairman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/grant-shapps-google-howtocorp-adsense?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Grant Shapps</a>, and the climate change minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/climate-change-minister-links-adviser?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Greg Barker</a>, both raise issues of ministerial conduct that potentially offends against aspects of the ministerial code and the <a href=\"http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm28/2850/285002.pdf\" title=\"\">Nolan principles</a>. Yet although Mr Cameron has referred Mr Barker's case to the cabinet secretary and his departmental permanent secretary, there is a defensiveness in his responses at odds with the words he wrote in 2010.</p> <p>These cases have not come out of the blue. Mr Cameron himself claimed that<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7189466/David-Cameron-warns-lobbying-is-next-political-scandal.html\" title=\"\"> the next big scandal</a> facing British politics would concern business lobbying and ministers. In office, Mr Cameron quickly became less troubled. The defence secretary Liam Fox was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/18/editorial-ministerial-code-foxing-system\" title=\"\">forced to resign</a> because he consistently and wilfully failed to live up to the standards set out in the ministerial code. His laissez-faire relationship with his defence adviser Adam Werritty revealed an indifference, perhaps even a contempt, towards ministerial standards.</p> <p>Then there were the links with Rupert Murdoch. Mr Cameron himself had at least 26 meetings with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/20/phone-hacking-the-judgement-thing\" title=\"\"> News International executives</a>, in his first 15 months as PM. His then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, was even more welcoming and chatty. He and his officials <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/leveson-inquiry/9288925/Jeremy-Hunts-799-texts-with-Rupert-Murdoch-lobbyist.html\" title=\"\">exchanged hundreds of texts</a> and had dozens of meetings with NI executives. Yet Mr Cameron not only stood by Mr Hunt but has now also promoted him to run the health department.</p> <p>The Shapps and Barker cases need to be seen in this context. Mr Shapps' problem is judgment. He founded a company selling software that breached Google standards. He promoted it under a false name while a backbench MP. And he secretly altered his own Wikipedia entries. Mr Barker's problem \u2013 shades of Mr Fox \u2013 is the ministerial code. His adviser was paid by the energy department, while simultaneously acting for private consultancy energy clients and doing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/timeline-greg-barker-miriam-maes-decc/print\" title=\"\">\"confidential work\" </a>for him. It is a hall of mirrors.</p> <p>It is important not to exaggerate the extent of sleaze in the system, but it is equally important not to underestimate it either. Few politicians get much benefit of the doubt these days \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/14/boris-johnson-most-respected-politician\" title=\"\">new polling</a> shows again and Mr Cameron's nerve of outrage seems to have become far too dulled. He needs to go back to basics, to his own code and to the Nolan principles of the 1990s \u2013 selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership \u2013 and apply them to his ministers with far greater rigour and awareness than he is currently doing.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2012. The original stated that \"He [Mr Barker] employs an adviser who is paid by the energy department...\". This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>We all remember it well: 17 years-old and full of hope, flicking through brochures in the school library, each of us desperately wondering where we'd end up spending the next three or four years of our lives. Whether to venture to a new city and move away from home, or save money and go to our local university. Picking a university was never easy \u2013 and this was before the days of spiralling fees.</p> <p>This year's batch of freshers will be the first to see the effects of the restructuring of UK higher education and increased tuition fees. Helping prospective students feel they've made the right decision has never been more important. To complicate matters, universities are scrambling to reap the rewards of the international student market, while absorbing their share of upward demand in postgraduate interest. These factors all contribute to the complex nature of the recruitment process.</p> <p>Catching the attention of international students has become a huge marketing challenge for universities, keen to get a share of the \u00a38.5bn that overseas students contribute to the UK economy every year; particularly as the educational infrastructure in countries like India and China improves. Faculties and departments need to be able to reach prospective international applicants, while clearly depicting the university's prowess and accreditations.</p> <p>As a solution universities are looking to their global shop window \u2013 the internet. The value of a good website is widely recognised, but many institutions still struggle to reflect a coherent branding strategy that transmits across the entire organisation on and offline. Individual faculties often operate without any interaction, while sub-level departments may pursue their own agendas altogether.</p> <p>Creating brand consistency across these many microcosms is no small task but there are certainly ways to achieve uniformity across the board while allowing personalities to shine through:</p> <h2><strong>1) Establish brand guidelines</strong></h2> <p>A framework for all departments within the university will ensure design consistency across the board. At a basic level, selecting and maintaining a complimentary colour palette throughout is a simple way of aesthetically uniting different areas and microsites, while providing some level of flexibility to communicate the unique character of each department and/or faculty. Similarly, consistency in font supports brand recognition and uniformity in site design.</p> <h2><strong>2) Clarify department goals</strong></h2> <p>A digital solution can only be effective by truly understanding and clarifying the goals of each department within the university. So for example, while one university department needs its website to attract more prospective students to apply, another is a leader in its field, using the platform only to qualify the highest calibre of entries. The end goal must always be to allow individual faculties to put across information that is relevant to their overall objectives, while still in keeping with the university's overall aspirations.</p> <h2><strong>3) Create building blocks</strong></h2> <p>To ensure brand consistency while maintaining flexibility, develop a range of modules from which to build each individual web page. The core structure and main features of the page will stay the same, ensuring visual compatibility across the university's website, but departments and faculties will be able to customise the content, combination and compilation of modules, maintaining relevant content and communicating their individual objectives and character more clearly.</p> <h2><strong>4) Be visual as well as verbal</strong></h2> <p>Visualisation can be an effective tool to attract international students, not only communicating the university's qualifications and capacity as an international university, but also overcoming potential language barriers. Visuals provide alternative means of communicating information, whilst also supporting the written content within the site.</p> <h2><strong>5) Personalise your welcome</strong></h2> <p>A university's website presents endless opportunities allowing institutions to produce personalise landing pages while still maintaining overall brand coherence. Separate homepages can be created for different user groups and personas, for instance freshers, international visitors, staff, and investors. The possibilities for tailored approaches are endless: personalised logins, homepages or interactive student calendars all mean disparate user groups can satisfy their online needs from one central point.</p> <p>The aim of any university website should be to provide information in a clear and accessible format, promoting the best user experience possible. As organisations see the value of investing more resources into their online strategy, we hope to see more of these personalised approaches for varying user groups. Each should reflect a harmony in overall brand architecture while demonstrating the merits of individual departments, letting the institution as a whole flaunt its many attributes.</p> <p><em>Neil Barr is managing director of </em><a href=\"http://www.alienationdigital.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Alienation Digital</em></a><em>, a digital agency with a large education portfolio including projects with the </em><a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Bath</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"http://home.bournemouth.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Bournemouth University</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>That Saburo Shochi completed a round-the-world trip using only public transport was impressive enough; that he did so at the age of 106 was even more remarkable. Yet in his native Japan, there is no shortage of contemporaries with whom he can celebrate his feat.</p> <p>According to government data released on Friday, he is one of more than 50,000 Japanese people aged 100 or more. The health and welfare ministry survey shows the number of centenarians will rise to 51,376 by Saturday, up 3,620 from last year.</p> <p>The figures, released before the country's annual respect the aged day on Monday, reinforce Japan's reputation for longevity, although its women recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/japanese-women-life-expectancy-tsunami\" title=\"\">relinquished their place at the top of the global life expectancy table to their counterparts in Hong Kong</a>. On Monday, those who reached their 100th birthday in the past year will receive a silver cup and a congratulatory letter from the prime minister.</p> <p>The average lifespan of Japanese women fell by 0.4 years to 85.9 in 2011, putting it behind that of women in Hong Kong, who averaged 86.7 \u2013 a shift A slight fall in female life expectancy in 2011 was attributed in part to the large number of elderly victims of the 2011 tsunami in north-east Japan.</p> <p>Women account for more than 87% of Japan's centenarians, although its oldest resident is a man, 115-year-old Jiroemon Kimura, who lives in Kyoto prefecture. The oldest woman is Koto Okubo, a 114-year-old resident of Kawasaki, just outside Tokyo.</p> <p>When the survey began in 1963, Japan was home to just 153 centenarians, and the number stood at just 10,000 as recently as 1998. Experts attribute the dramatic rise of the 100-plus generation to older people's fastidious attachment to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/jul/08/longtermcare.society\" title=\"\">traditional low-fat Japanese diet, strong community ties, affordable healthcare and generous pensions</a>.</p> <p>The explosion in the population of Japanese over 65, coupled with a shrinking workforce, is expected to put unprecedented strain on the country's pension system in the decades to come.</p> <p>Japan's oldest citizens were at the centre of a scandal in 2010 after it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/12/japan-missing-elderly-centenarians\" title=\"\">at least 200 centenarians had gone missing from local government records</a>. In some cases, people who had died were still listed as alive, including a woman mistakenly recorded as having reached 125, whose registered home was turned into a park in 1981.</p> <p>Shochi, whose trip around the globe has been recognised as a Guinness world record, travelled through North America, Europe and Africa as part of a series of lecture tours on child education and health he began several years ago. To achieve the record, he used scheduled, not chartered, public transport, including planes, trains, boats and buses.</p> <p>Returning from a tour last month, the professor emeritus at Fukuoka University of Education said he intended to live even longer. \"In my entire life, I've never said I am tired,\" he told reporters.</p>",
  "<p>With the capital still basking in an Olympic glow, London fashion week sprang to life on Friday with a typically impressive breadth of talent, character and spirit.</p> <p>A brass band played on the catwalk to celebrate the 25th anniversary of designers Antoni &amp; Alison; supermodel Helena Christensen invited a select audience to her debut lingerie launch for Triumph; and international mega brand Alexander McQueen flung open the doors to its first McQ store \u2013 the label's slightly less expensive collection.</p> <p>In the past few years London fashion week has proved a slick operation with increasing international clout, attracting more press and buyers. A key to this has been the development and retention of designers such as Christopher Kane and Mary Katrantzou. A few years ago, designers on their level of ascent would have moved to show in New York or Paris rather than staying in London.</p> <p>Orders worth around \u00a3100m are now placed at London fashion week each season, with buyers attending from 28 countries. A recent report by Oxford Economics estimated that sales of UK designer clothing have been rising by around 20% a year in the last decade, and are currently worth somewhere in the region of \u00a32.5bn to \u00a32.9bn.</p> <p>\"You wouldn't recognise it,\" says designer Antoni Burakowski about how much London fashion week has changed. In 1987, when he and partner Alison Roberts started their label, no one was interested in the new talent. \"Every one back then was looking at the older designers not the newer ones,\" he said. \"But that has completely reversed now.\"</p> <p>For their 51st collection Antoni &amp; Alison showed a jolly series of 38 dresses featuring trompe l'oeil belts or jewels, paintbrush strokes and giant bows. It demonstrated immediately one of the key areas that London designers have become particularly celebrated for: colour and print.</p> <p>If there was any criticism it was that perhaps these splashy designs would have also looked strong on separates, such as trousers. But the designers, who spent four intense days creating the collection with \"a lot of paint, some HB pencils and no talking\", insisted that dresses simply made for \"better blank canvases\". Retail support for British designers has been critical in the success of London fashion week. Tom and Ruth Chapman, owners of top end retailer Matches, who distribute to 140 countries worldwide, are staunch supporters of many of the names that fill the London catwalk schedule.</p> <p>This fashion week, their Marylebone store will sell only British designers or those labels who choose to show in London. A couture dress by Giles Deacon, which costs \u00a360,000 to order, stands on a mannequin in the shop window.</p> <p>\"British designers have moved the plate so much to what they were doing five or ten years ago,\" says Tom Chapman. Central to these changes, he says, have been a distinct improvement on the overall fit and quality of the clothes.</p> <p>Ruth Chapman said: \"Rather than doing an ego trip, designers are making sure what they put on the runway is actually wearable.\"</p> <p>The smartest designers now seek advice from retailers on what is selling and how they should be costing the garments. \"London designers are defiantly producing product that can compete from a quality and design perspective on the global market,\" says Deacon, who will show his new collection on Monday.</p> <p>\"Retailers clearly can see this and are taking London more seriously.\"</p> <p>Alexander McQueen, a fashion house with London roots and international power, announced plans this week to show their menswear in London next January as part of the second London Collections Men, another initiative that has boosted London's style credentials.</p> <p>McQueen also unveiled its first McQ boutique on Dover Street to coincide with the start of fashion week on Friday. Designed by David Collins, the store is a mix of high-end sumptuousness \u2013 a velvet padded lift and shag pile rugs \u2013 and the hi-tech. In the men's department a giant cameraphone is attached to the wall and allows customers to take their own photos and email them from the shop floor.</p> <p>Supermodel Helena Christensen launched her lingerie debut with Triumph dressed in a brightly patterned dress by British designer Alice Temperley.

  "<p>Mining shares surged and led the market to a six month high, after the US Federal Reserve became the latest bank to attempt to boost the flagging global economy.</p> <p>Thursday's announcement of a third round of quantitative easing by Fed chairman Ben Bernanke helped lift the price of commodities, with copper hitting a five month high on the prospect of increased demand for metals. The Fed's action came a week after the European Central Bank unveiled a bond buying programme to help struggling eurozone countries, with investors hoping China would soon follow suit and cut its interest rates or enact other stimulus measures. UBS said:</p> <blockquote> The Fed's announcement of QE3 is clearly bullish for commodities and the miners. Copper is well positioned to benefit after destocking with speculative interest. We expect iron ore prices to recover with seasonal demand towards the end of October; QE3, with China stimulus/steel mill destocking, increases confidence in our 2013 forecasts. </blockquote> <p><strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 93p higher at 773p while Russian steel group <strong>Evraz</strong>, controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, ended up 34.3p at 293.7p. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 128.5p to \u00a310.90, despite having to halt iron ore production in Goa this week amid an investigation into the legality of mining operations in the area.</p> <p><strong>Xstrata</strong> added 67.5p to 1060.5p, ahead of a decision by its board about whether to recommend a revised $34bn bid from <strong>Glencore</strong>, up 25.55p at 378.85p. Xstrata also shook off problems at Rustenburg in South Africa, where striking miners have been protesting against wage restraints. Xstrata, <strong>Anglo American</strong>, up 175p at \u00a320.84, <strong>Aquarius Platinum</strong>, 7.7p higher at 48.8p, and <strong>Lonmin</strong>, 29p better at 614.5p, have all been forced to shut down mines as tensions escalated following the killing last month of 34 miners.</p> <p>The top ten risers in the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> were commodity companies, helping lift the leading index 95.63 points higher to 5915.55, its best level since 19 March. The leading index has added more than 120 points in a week which, apart from the Fed move, saw progress in the eurozone crisis, with a pro-euro vote in the Dutch elections, Germany's constitutional court backing the eurozone bailout fund and hopes that Spain will receive bailout assistance.</p> <p>The week also saw a spate of takeover rumours. Software group <strong>Sage</strong> edged up another 1p to 318.1p - a near 5% rise on the week following talk of a potential 450p a share offer from private equity. Microsoft and SAP have also been named as potential predators for Sage in the past, but some in the City remain sceptical. George O'Connor of Panmure Gordon issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> We dispute the take-over chit chat, hence we encourage investors to bank some profit, before trading news gets in the way. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>J Sainsbury</strong> added 3.5p to 341p on revived chatter that 26% shareholder the Qatari Investment Authority might be considering another bid after its failed attempt with a 600p offer five years ago.</p> <p>One longstanding takeover tale came good. <strong>BAE Systems</strong> confirmed it was in merger talks with Airbus maker EADS. BAE closed 9.9p higher at 347p.</p> <p>Apple's launch of its new iPhone helped one of its suppliers, chip designer <strong>Arm</strong>, up 20p at 582p. <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong>, another Apple supplier which fell back on Thursday after an uninspiring trading update, recovered 24p to 590p.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong> fell 62p to \u00a335.72 after analysts at Liberum Capital issued a sell note:</p> <blockquote> For the buy case to work one would have to assume earnings from [Reckitt Benkiser's pharmaceuticals division] at least doubles; given the threat of generics and potential alternative treatments we think that is not realistic. </blockquote> <p><strong>Intertek</strong> lost 11p to \u00a32718 after HSBC cut its target price on the testing and inspection group from \u00a329.65 to \u00a329.40 and moved from overweight to neutral.</p> <p>With risk back on the agenda, defensive stocks were unwanted. <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> fell 22p to 1417.5p, and <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> dropped 19.5p to \u00a328.93.</p> <p>A couple of consumer businesses that rarely disappoint investors, managed to do just that during the week. <strong>Next</strong> fell sharply after it reported a slowdown in sales in August and early September on Thursday but regained 40p to \u00a333.60. <strong>Burberry</strong> added 44p to \u00a310.94 but failed to regain all of the losses made since Tuesday's profit warning, which prompted fears the boom in the luxury goods market had finally run out of steam.</p> <p>But <strong>Ocado</strong> added 1.2p to 74.05p, despite a downbeat note on the online grocer from analysts at Barclays:</p> <blockquote> After a disruptive Jubilee weekend in the second quarter, Ocado's chief executive sensibly erred on the side of caution and commented that the effect of the Olympic Games \"was uncertain.\" Now that the summer's sporting events are over, we suspect that the Olympic Games will have been unhelpful on balance for Ocado and expect slower sales growth in the third quarter (around 11%). <br> Given a lack of market share indicators for Ocado we would not be surprised to see a even more significant slowdown in sales growth. [Note that Ocado reported second quarter growth of 13% and first quarter growth of 10.9%]. It is worth nothing that the third quarter is a one off given the Olympics, so it would not be fair to draw a strong long-term implication from this trading statement, however it is likely to weigh on short term sentiment. Such a performance would imply that Ocado needs to have a very strong fourth quarter to meet second half consensus sales estimates. </blockquote> <p><strong>BSkyB</strong>, beaten by BT to a \u00a3152m rugby television rights deal, dropped 24p to 720pp despite news it had bought back another 350,000 shares for cancellation.</p> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Pace</strong> slumped nearly 10% to 162.5p following a report that BT had decided not to use the company's set top boxes for the YouView service. Pace later said the outcome of its discussions with BT would not have a material impact on its earnings, but this did little to calm investors' nerves.</p>",
  "<p>In Jamaica <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/clover-graham-obituary\" title=\"\">Clover Graham</a> was the eyes and ears of the United Nations refugee agency. As honorary liaison for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), her passion for justice and human rights filled a needed gap in the legal infrastructure in Jamaica. She not only advocated for and counseled asylum seekers, assisted with refugee status and resettlement procedures but she also kept tabs on how refugee families were doing and helped instill a sense of safety and community.</p> <p>\"To all who knew her, Clover was a selfless humanitarian, a passionate human rights activist, a leader who constantly inspired others to take action, combining her legal expertise and intellectual depth with human kindness,\" wrote the high commissioner for refugees, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in an all staff announcement about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19338826\" title=\"\">Clover's murder</a> last month.</p> <p>Before her untimely death on August 18th, Clover was a dedicated law professor who contributed to the development of the legal aid system in Jamaica. From her days with Brixton Black Women's Centre to her work with refugees, Clover never gave up advocating for those in need of legal assistance.</p> <p>From 1998 Clover worked on behalf of UNHCR with a group of Haitian refugees who fled political violence associated with the coup d'etat that ousted President Aristide in 1991 and his return to power in 1994. Like all refugees, they feared for their lives and sought safety on the shores of Jamaica. Clover worked with the authorities to make refuge possible. At the time of her murder, she was in the process of advocating for the naturalisation of over a dozen Haitian refugees.</p> <p>Clover made it her personal mission to ensure no refugee or asylum seeker was left without protection. This is how she met a former child soldier from Sierra Leone. Clover advocated that this young refugee be moved from Trinidad to Kingston, Jamaica, so he could pursue his musical education. Like so many people Clover assisted, she welcomed him into her extended family.</p> <p>In 2007 Clover's son, Taiwo, and his girlfriend were murdered. Shortly following this horrible loss Clover continued her dedicated and inspired work with UNHCR finding solace in seeking justice for refugees. Clover was also a UK citizen and could have lived a more comfortable life but she stood by her country with its grand beauty and devastating weaknesses.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/homicide.html\" title=\"\">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a>, Jamaica has the highest murder rate in the Caribbean. In 2011, of the thousands of murders in Jamaica, 1125 were reported, and few led to sentencing. In the report, <a href=\"http://www.genevadeclaration.org/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2011.html\" title=\"\">Global Burden of Armed Violence: Lethal Encounters</a>, Jamaica is ranked third in countries most affected by violence, behind El Salvador and Iraq. In spite of these terrifying statistics, Clover pursued justice with a single-edged sword working tirelessly for vulnerable refugees and fellow citizens by providing legal aid and basic assistance \u2014 often from her own pocket.</p> <p>In one of the last correspondence our office received from Clover in June, she sent us an article about the men convicted of the murders of her son Taiwo and his girlfriend. The email was titled \"Finally\" and you could sense that Clover was finally at peace after a four year battle she fought to have some of the perpetrators prosecuted. Clover was one of the few voices that rose above and demanded justice for their deaths. She was a courageous person. Following her death, UNHCR is now among the chorus of voices that have taken up Clover's cause and continue to urge the authorities to do everything they can to bring the perpetrators of her murder to justice.</p> <p>While in Jamaica last week we were pleased to learn that the authorities are trying to identify the perpetrators, and that this murder, as well as many others affecting the Jamaican society, will not go unpunished. We hope that as the spotlight turns away from her death to competing demands that the authorities spare no effort until justice is done.</p>",
  "<p>I wrote my <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-speed-read-its-the-middle-class-stupid-by-james-carville-and-stan-greenberg/2012/06/29/gJQASc0JCW_story.html\">book</a>, It's the Middle Class, Stupid, with James Carville for one simple reason: we failed. James and I have spent our lives focused on getting working people a fair shake for a hard day's work. We put the middle class at the centre of the world, because you can't have an America without a middle class.</p> <p>In America, the \"middle class\" isn't what it is in Britain. It's the words we use to describe people who aren't poor and aren't rich \u2013 the people British Labour party leader Ed Miliband calls the \"squeezed middle\". For much of American history since the second world war, the middle class prospered as America prospered. But as we neared 1980, the country changed and never turned back. The top 20% were on their way up with the top 1% surging beyond them, but for the median household \u2013 the core of the middle class \u2013 the good days had gone. </p> <p>Today, if you are a low-income household \u2013 the bottom 20% \u2013 you make less now than you did <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/opinion/sunday/why-cant-we-end-poverty-in-america.html?pagewanted=all\">in 1973</a>. If you are in the middle, you are just a little bit ahead but haven't seen any gain in real income since the turn of the century. When all is said and done, you are just 10% up over the last 30 years, while the top fifth of the population are up 50%. The economic woes of the squeezed middle were exacerbated by the financial crisis, but they weren't caused by it.</p> <p>That is having a profound impact on our politics. When I first <a href=\"http://gqrr.com/index.php?ID=1952\">identified</a> the \"Reagan Democrats\" in the 1980s, based on work from Macomb County, Michigan, the concerns raised most by white, middle-class swing voters were about race. They felt their struggles were a result of government favouring other races over them. Today, in an increasingly diverse America, race, of course, remains an issue, but it is not the central concern for swing voters. Ask them about the roots of their economic struggles today and they don't point to other people like them but of a different colour, they point to the elite \u2013 Wall Street and Washington. They blame them for rising prices, for a lack of jobs, for government deficits. Warren Buffet summed it up:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There's been class warfare going on the for the last 20 years, and my class won.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, now the middle class wants to fight back. Ask voters in the US how they want the country to address the deficit, and answers Nos 1 and 2 will be a surtax on millionaires and raising taxes for those earning over $250,000 \u2013 not to mention a tax on short-term financial transactions. When I ran a dial test on the president's state of the union speech in 2011, swing voters' dial meters spun literally off the top of the graph when the president <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/01/obama-renews-tax-cut-battle-with-republicans/1\">said</a>, \"if we truly care about our deficit, we simply can't afford a permanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of Americans.\"</p> <p>As Barack Obama looks to a tough economic environment and an opponent who is sticking to the trickle-down economic theories of the past, the president is increasingly seeking to be the champion of the middle class. A year ago, his campaign was about trying to convince people that the recovery has worked and the other guys would wreck it \u2013 \"don't give the keys back to the guys who drove the car into the ditch.\" A smart message if you have hauled the car out of the ditch, but not so good when people are in real economic pain.</p> <p>Today, he has shifted. When I was at the Democratic convention in Charlotte last week, I was delighted to be one of thousands of delegates holding up placards that say \"Middle Class First\".</p> <p>The issues of \"the middle class\", \"the squeezed middle\", \"hardworking families\", or whatever you want to call them, are rising in electorates all over the world. The answer to that isn't some short-term stimulus or a bout of austerity, important as that debate is. Voters know that the most fundamental problems they face are deep, started before the crisis and will take time to turn around. They are looking for a politics that is honest about the challenges: of fiscal policy, of globalization, of demographic change, of the difficulty of reforming government.</p> <p>They want a politics that doesn't duck those challenges, but gives them a concrete way forward, so they can again see a path to rising prosperity for their family and themselves.</p>",

  "<p>South Africa has given the art world a good number of famous photographers \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.davidgoldblatt.com/\" title=\"\">David Goldblatt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.santumofokeng.com/\" title=\"\">Santu Mofokeng</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rogerballen.com/\" title=\"\">Roger Ballen</a> \u2013 but the wider photographic history of the country remains almost unknown. That would be enough to make <a href=\"http://www.icp.org/museum/exhibitions\" title=\"\">Rise and Fall of Apartheid</a>, the extensive and strikingly ambitious exhibition now open at the International Center of Photography in New York, into an important event.</p> <p>What makes this show unmissable is something else: the forceful argument of its Nigerian-born curator, <a href=\"http://www.formerwest.org/Contributors/OkwuiEnwezor\" title=\"\">Okwui Enwezor</a>, that apartheid-era South Africa was \"essentially a neofascist culture\", and photography, more than any other artistic medium, offered a means to reinforce it or to contest it.</p> <p>It's a broadly chronological show, and its opening galleries show the speed with which South African photography was transformed from an ethnographic practice to an engaged, politicised one. Photographic output exploded after the institution of apartheid in 1948, especially in the contested spaces of South Africa's cities. In one shot we see a bench marked Whites Only, where a young fair-haired girl sits while her black nanny hovers behind her. In another, an older white woman in pearls is sitting on a bench with the same repugnant text on it \u2013 but she's wearing a <a href=\"http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/about-the-black-sash\" title=\"\">black sash</a>, the symbol of the non-violent women's anti-apartheid organisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396734296\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/14/1347634822683/South-Africa-goes-on-tria-008.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa goes on trial\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa goes on trial, by Alf Khumalo, shows the scenes outside courts when three major sabotage trials started in Pretoria, Cape Town and Maritzburg in 1963.

It was also, especially for the black majority, a means of self-fashioning. <a href=\"http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/drum-magazine\" title=\"\">Drum Magazine</a>, founded in Johannesburg in 1951, modernised the image of the black South African from rural native to urban habitu\u00e9. Photographers of all races contributed, and the magazine mixed reportage with fashion and arts photography: there's a killer shot by <a href=\"http://jurgenschadeberg.com/\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg</a> of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/11/miriam-makeba-obituary\" title=\"\">Miriam Makeba</a> in a strapless dress, singing with her eyes closed.

  "<p>A madness is taking hold. In the same week as Arctic ice cover is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">recorded at its lowest ever extent</a>, two major countries decide to reduce or eliminate their use of the only proven source of low-carbon power that can be deployed at sufficient scale to tackle our climate crisis. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/japan-end-nuclear-power\" title=\"\">Japan plans to phase out nuclear entirely by 2030</a>, its prime minister announced today. The French president has just revealed a plan to dramatically reduce the country's reliance on nuclear, which currently gives France some of the cleanest electricity in the world.</p> <p>Let me be very clear. Without nuclear, the battle against global warming is as good as lost. Even many greens now admit this in private moments. We are already witnessing the first signs of the collapse in the biosphere this entails \u2013 with the Arctic in full-scale meltdown, more solar radiation is being captured by the dark ocean surface, and the weather systems of the entire northern hemisphere are being thrown into chaos. With nuclear, there is a chance that global warming this century can be limited to 2C; without nuclear, I would guess we are heading for 4C or above. That will devastate ecosystems and societies worldwide on a scale which is unimaginable.</p> <p>Given the trauma the Japanese people have suffered since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March 2011, it is understandable that major questions are asked of domestic politicians. But we must never forget that Fukushima has killed no one. More people in Japan recently died from an <em>E coli</em> outbreak due to eating contaminated pickles. Scientists also agree there will never be an observable cancer increase in the Japanese population attributable to Fukushima.</p> <p>But in response to the nuclear shutdown, oil and gas imports to Japan have doubled, and carbon dioxide emissions soared by more than 60m tonnes. Any environmentalist who celebrates this outcome is not worthy of the name.</p> <p>Japan is already backing away from its own climate change targets. As a participant in the UN climate negotiations last year, I watched this happen. Under the 2009 Copenhagen accord, Japan pledged to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 25% by 2020. The plan was to increase nuclear to half of national electricity in order to facilitate the carbon cuts, supported by an increase in renewables to 20% by 2030. To reach the same targets without nuclear is impossible; wind and solar combined meet barely 1% of electricity production today in Japan, and there is no way they can be deployed at sufficient scale to meet the gap. So the climate targets will be dropped, as Japan re-carbonises its economy.</p> <p>It is nothing short of insane that politicians around the world, under pressure from populations subjected to decades of anti-nuclear fearmongering by people who call themselves greens, are raising our collective risk of catastrophic climate change in order to eliminate the safest power source ever invented.</p> <p>More people die each day from coal pollution than have been killed by nuclear power in 50 years of operation, and that is even before factoring in the impact on global warming. That such populist irrationality should guide public policy in so many countries \u2013 and on such an important issue as energy \u2013 is nothing short of a disaster.</p> <p>All is not yet lost. 2030 is a long way away, and as Japan watches its heavy industry shut down and relocate offshore due to rising energy costs and supply shortages, there may be a rethink. France may decide to keep its nuclear stations as it watches Germany's much vaunted dash for solar dissolve in a cloud of coal smoke. But ultimately energy policy must be responsive to public opinion, and as long as people across the world get it so wrong on nuclear risk and continue to ignore the real and rising risks of climate change, the planet is in very serious trouble.</p>",
  "<p>Sea ice in the Arctic has shrunk to its smallest extent ever recorded, smashing the previous record minimum and prompting warnings of accelerated climate change.</p> <p>Satellite images show that the rapid summer melt has reduced the area of frozen sea to <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">less than 3.5 million square kilometres this week</a> \u2013 less than half the area typically occupied four decades ago.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice cover has been shrinking since the 1970s when it averaged around 8m sq km a year, but such a dramatic collapse in ice cover in one year is highly unusual.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\" title=\"\">A record low in 2007</a> of 4.17m sq km <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">was broken on 27 August 2012</a>; further melting has since amounted to more than 500,000 sq km.</p> <p>The record, which is based on a five-day average, is expected to be officially declared in the next few days by the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">National Snow and Ice Data Centre</a> in Colorado. The NSIDC's data shows the sea ice extent is bumping along the bottom, with a new low of 3.421m sq km on Tuesday, which rose very slightly to 3.429m sq km on Wednesday and 3.45m sq km on Thursday.</p> <p>Scientists predicted on Friday that the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in summer months within 20 years, leading to possibly major climate impacts. \"I am surprised. This is an indication that the Arctic sea ice cover is fundamentally changing. The trends all show less ice and thinner ice,\" said Julienne Stroeve, a research scientist with the NSIDC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396182754\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347636881754/Arctic-sea-ice-loss-001.jpg\" alt=\"Arctic sea ice loss\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arctic sea ice loss  Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shrinking of the ice cap was interpreted by environment groups as a signal of long-term global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/arctic-climate-change\" title=\"\">study published in July in the journal Environmental Research Letters</a>, that compared model projections with observations, estimated that the radical decline in Arctic sea ice has been between 70-95% due to human activities.</p> <p>\"We are on the edge of one of the most significant moments in environmental history as sea ice heads towards a new record low. The loss of sea ice will be devastating, raising global temperatures that will impact on our ability to grow food and causing extreme weather around the world,\" said John Sauven, director of Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>Sea ice experts on Friday said they were surprised by the collapse because weather conditions were not especially conducive to a major melt this year. The ice is now believed to be much thinner than it used to be and easier to melt.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice follows an annual cycle of melting through the warm summer months and refreezing in the winter. The sea ice plays a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the Sun's energy, helping to cool the Earth.</p> <p>David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: \"The disappearance of Arctic ice is the most visible warning sign of the need to tackle climate change and ensure we have a world fit to pass on to the next generation. The sheer scale of ice loss is shocking and unprecedented. This alarm call from the Arctic needs to reverberate across Whitehall and boardrooms. We can all take action to cut carbon emissions and move towards a 100% renewable economy.\"</p> <p>Ed Davey, the UK climate and energy secretary, said: \"These findings highlight the urgency for the international community to act. We understand that Arctic sea-ice decline has accelerated over recent years as global warming continues to increase Arctic temperatures at a faster rate than the global average.</p> <p>\"This Government is working hard to tackle climate change and we are working closely with our international partners not to exceed 2 degrees above pre industrial levels. I am calling for the EU to increase its emission target from 20% to 30% and will be taking an active lead at the UNFCCC Climate change talks in Doha later this year, where I will push for further progress towards a new global deal on climate change and for more mitigation action now. The fact is that we cannot afford to wait\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-harsh-winter-europe\" title=\"\">Canadian scientists said this week</a> that the record melt this year could lead to a cold winter in the UK and Europe, as the heat in the Arctic water will be released into the atmosphere this autumn, potentially affecting the all-important jet stream.

  "<p>A decade ago, SEO was an entirely predictable and (relatively) accessible digital marketing channel. Websites were created, stuffed full of keywords, cloaked with supporting content and \u2013 hey presto! \u2013 excellent rankings ensued. More recently, as page ranking became the focus of SEO efforts, the process of \"gaming\" the algorithm was still relatively straightforward, thanks to the link economy and the relative ease with which off-site authority could be manufactured by directory submissions, content placement, and grey-hat efforts to acquire links via sponsorships, ad banners and the like.</p> <p>Fast forward to the present day, and the latest algorithm changes have raised the bar substantially. Let's be clear; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Panda\">Google's Panda</a> (which rewards websites that deliver high quality, original, in-depth content) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin\">Penguin</a> (which punishes websites for the presence of clearly manufactured back links) are undoubtedly a good thing for users. They effectively ensure that only the most relevant, reputable and responsive websites are rewarded by Google with prominent search engine results page (SERP) visibility. These latest updates have effectively killed the traditional low-cost/low-value approach to SEO campaigns. And rest assured, future changes will deliver more of the same, as Google (and Bing) will increasingly use a broader and more subtle range of signals to deliver improved search quality.</p> <p>For some marketers, this is very good news indeed. Established and recognised brands that genuinely deserve to reap the benefits of quality, authenticity and advocacy will dominate the SERPs, gain traffic, interaction and conversions, and naturally reinforce their strengths.</p> <p>But hold on, what if I run a startup business, perhaps with a limited budget, and a rapid break-even prerogative? Forecasting the returns from SEO is extremely difficult. Given the choice between a mid to high-risk punt on investing in SEO over a sustained period, versus the relative certainty of PPC, where entry costs can be low, learnings are rapidly acquired and audience targeting is becoming more and more sophisticated, marketers could be tempted to opt for the safer paid media option.</p> <h2>What makes SEO offputting?</h2> <p>SEO today demands a sophisticated blend of content creation, on-site optimisation, structuring, distribution, amplification, authorship and socialisation. In short, it's either expensive or time consuming, or both. It's often beyond the means of many smaller businesses, unless they are very determined, or operate in a lucrative niche market. This in turn means that SEO campaigns can only be justified by larger players, leveraging existing and expensively gained domain authority to launch new products within an established category, or just splashing the cash to mirror brand aspirations by creating visibility for vanity keywords (\"we're the biggest chocolate company in the UK, we should be number one for chocolate,\" for example).</p> <p>Now for the killer blow to SEO \u2013 mobile. Consider the facts: UK smartphone penetration is running at just over 50%, with 59% of these users accessing the web via their device every day. Mobile search queries have increased in volume by over 500% in just under two years. So what? Well, pop out your smartphone, and search for something. Now look at how many natural versus paid results you see. For the majority of search terms, the page will be dominated by paid listings, enhanced with eye-catching ad extensions such as user reviews, click to call, maps etc. Not much natural visibility there. And already there are further developments ahead, with Google and others launching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/10/augmented-reality-glasses-google-project?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">interactive glasses</a>.</p> <p>And there's a second killer blow to consider, that our search experience moves from a proactive quest for information to a reactive and intuitive scenario where your device knows about you, your diary, your location, your friends, your purchasing history, your pets \u2013 and makes helpful suggestions in real time to support your information needs. In case you missed it, this is already happening \u2013 it's called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/landing/now/\">Google Now</a>, and it's not search, in any way, shape or form.</p> <p>In the context of consumerism, products such as Google Now will inevitably erode traditional search behaviour, because people are lazy, and getting lazier. That's why consumer innovations such as video on demand, home-delivered groceries and one-click ordering have been so successful, and equally why the future of search as we know it now, and especially SEO, looks a little less than rosy.</p> <p>On a positive note, this does create an opportunity for SEO to succeed, because for every business that runs the numbers and decides to focus on paid media or (heaven forbid) some offline marketing, there will be another player who does something innovative, compelling and creative, with a \"just do it\" attitude, and an appetite for long-term success. Good luck to these pioneers, and goodbye to rest.</p> <p><em>Matt Owen is head of UK Agency, Global SEO and Social Media at </em><a href=\"http://www.jellyfish.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"\"><em>Jellyfish</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/media-network/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Our planet is waving the white flag of surrender. But as the polar flag becomes ever more tattered, with holes scorched by hotter ocean waters, humanity pumps ever more globe-warming gases into the air.</p> <p>The story of the Arctic ice cap is the story of modern environmentalism. In 1968, as satellites began to document the vast ice field blanketing the north pole, the iconic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise\">Earthrise image</a> was beamed back to the ground. It revealed a planet of awesome beauty, deep blue oceans, verdant continents and crowned with at least 8m square kilometres of gleaming ice. The image kickstarted the global green movement. </p> <p>In 2007, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\">new record was set</a> for the minimum summer sea ice cover in the Arctic had halved. This furious flag waving attracted attention. That year, the world's scientists declared the end of any doubt that our addiction to burning fossil fuels was changing the face of the planet. Al Gore expounded his inconvenient truth and the world seemed set to act.</p> <p>Today, that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\">2007 record is smashed</a> and the shredded white flag is now flickering rathering than flashing. But the danger is greater than even, even if the alarm signal is frayed.</p> <p>The last great global ice melt the planet witnessed came 11,700 years ago at the end of a deep ice age. As glaciers retreated, a benign and balmy climate emerged in which the human race has flourished. Our entire civilisation is built on the warm soils left as the ice sheets melted.</p> <p>This new great melting heralds the polar opposite: the gravest of threats to civilisation. Removing the lid from the pole will release heat equivalent to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/decline-sea-ice-arctic\">fast-forwarding human-caused climate change by two decades</a>, say scientists. </p> <p>Will this be the first great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point_%28climatology%29\">tipping point</a> to tumble the world into a new and hostile climate regime, as the cooling, reflective ice vanishes? Will the new, warm Arctic radically alter the temperate weather enjoyed by Europeans, for whom global warming has seemed a distant concern?</p> <p>We seem to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower\">prepared to take that chance</a>. The shrinking ice has not opened new leads for decisive global action to tackle climate change. Instead, in a vicious irony, the new channels are being exploited for oil and gas exploration, unearthing more of the very fuels driving the warming.</p> <p>Decades from now, will today's record sea ice low be seen as the moment when our Earthly paradise gave up the ghost and entered a hellish new era? I sincerely hope not, but with this global distress signal failing to attract attention, I fear the worst.</p> <p><em>\u2022 You can add your <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/14/sea-ice-climate-change\">comments on our live blog</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012. The original said the last great global ice melt the planet witnessed came 10,000 years ago. This has been corrected to say 11,700 years ago.</p>",
  "<p>We are a few hundred miles from the north pole. The air temperature is -3C, the sea freezing. All around us in these foggy Arctic waters at the top of the world are floes \u2013 large and small chunks of sea ice that melt and freeze again with the seasons.</p> <p>Arne Sorensen, our Danish ice pilot, is 60 feet up in the crow's nest of the Arctic Sunrise vessel. Visibility is just 200 yards and he inches the 1,000-tonne Greenpeace ice breaker forward at two knots through narrow passages of clear water. The floes are piled up and compressed in fantastic shapes and shades of grey and blue; they crack, rumble and groan as we nudge them aside or climb over them. Two polar bears on our port side lift their heads but resume hunting.</p> <p>Sorensen has sailed deep into ice at both poles for 30 years, but this voyage is different, he says. The edge of the Arctic ice cap is usually far south of where we are now at the very end of the melt season. More than 600,000 square kilometres (sq km) more ice <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/09/arctic-sea-ice-falls-below-4-million-square-kilometers/\" title=\"\">has melted in 2012 than was ever recorded by satellites before</a>. Now the minimum extent has been nearly reached and the sea is starting to refreeze.</p> <p>\"This is the new minimum extent of the ice cap,\" he says, the \"frontline of climate change\".</p> <p>\"It is sad. I am not doubting this is related to emitting fossil fuels to a large extent. It's sad to observe that we are capable of changing the planet to such a degree.\"</p> <p>The vast polar ice cap, which regulates the Earth's temperature and has been a permanent fixture in our understanding of how the world works, has this year retreated further and faster than anyone expected. The previous record, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\" title=\"\">set in 2007</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">was officially broken on 27 August</a> when satellite images averaged over five days showed the ice then extended 4.11 million sq km, a reduction of nearly 50% compared to just 40 years ago.</p> <p>But since 27 August, the ice just kept melting \u2013 at nearly 40,000 sq km a day until a few days ago. Satellite pictures this weekend showed the cap covering only 3.49m sq km. This year, 11.7m sq km of ice melted, 22% more than the long-term average of 9.18m sq km. The record minimum extent is now likely to be formally called on Monday by the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) in Colorado.</p> <p>The record hasn't just been broken, it's been smashed to smithereens, adding weight to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/15/arctic-survey-ice-melting\" title=\"\">predictions that the Arctic may be ice-free in summer months within 20 years</a>, say British, Italian and American-based scientists on board the Arctic Sunrise. They are shocked at the speed and extent of the ice loss.</p> <p>The Cambridge University Sea ice researcher Nick Toberg, who has analysed underwater ice thickness data collected by British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless in 2004 and 2007, said: \"This is staggering. It's disturbing, scary that we have physically changed the face of the planet. We have about 4m sq km of sea ice. If that goes in the summer months that's about the same as adding 20 years of CO<sub>2</sub> at current [human-caused] rates into the atmosphere. That's how vital the arctic sea ice is.</p> <p>\"In the 1970s we had 8m sq km of sea ice. That has been halved. We need it in the summer. It has never decreased like this before\".</p> <p>\"We knew the ice was getting thinner but I did not expect we'd lose this much this year. We broke the record by a lot\", says the NSIDC scientist <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/research/bios/stroeve.html\" title=\"\">Julienne Stroeve</a>.</p> <p>\"The acceleration of the loss of the extent of the ice is mostly because the ice has been so thin. This would explain why it has melted so much this year. By June the ice edge had pulled back to where it normally is in September,\" she says.</p> <p>\"The 2007 record was set when you had weather conditions which were perfect for melting. This year we didn't have those. It was mixed. So this suggests the ice has got to a point where it's so thin it doesn't matter what the weather is, it's going to melt in the summer. This could become the new normal,\" says Stroeve.</p> <p>In the past Stroeve has shown that ice melt has been happening far faster than the models predicted. Her new research, <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL052676.shtml\" title=\"\">published last month</a> in the journal Geophysical Research Papers, shows humans may have been responsible for most of the ice loss in recent decades.</p> <p>\"It suggests 60% of the observed decline in ice extent in Septembers from 1953-2011 was due to human activity. The decline is linked to the increase in temperatures,\" she says.</p> <p>\"This year is significant. At the moment the [ice extent] is below what the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report will show in 2014. We are on the extreme edge of the models, suggesting that ice loss is happening much faster than the models suggested,\" says Stroeve.</p> <p>All over the Arctic the effects of accelerating ice loss and a warming atmosphere are being seen. The ecology is changing rapidly as trees and plants move north, new beetles devastate whole forests in Canada, Siberia and Alaska, and snowfall increases. Inuit and other communities report more avalanches, the erosion of sea cliffs and melting of the permafrost affecting roads and buildings. Whole coastal communities may have to be moved to avoid sea erosion.</p> <p>With the ice loss has come <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/05/oil-supplies-arctic\" title=\"\">a rush by industry for Arctic resources</a>. Oil, gas, mining and shipping companies are all expanding operations into areas that until only 20 years ago would have been physically impossible. They bring new opportunities for trade, but new threats to the environment. On Monday, a historic first drilling operation by Shell in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2012/09/10/2619205/shell-halts-chukchi-sea-drilling.html\" title=\"\">was halted after sea ice was seen moving towards the oil company's drill ship</a>.</p> <p>Other new research suggests that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/met-office-arctic-sea-ice-loss-winter\" title=\"\">the loss of ice could be could be affecting the path and speed of the jet streams</a>, possibly explaining why extreme weather in the northern hemisphere is lasting longer.</p> <p>\"There is evidence of stronger and more intense north Atlantic storms and extreme weather, says Stroeve. \"We are thinking we are entering a new climate state. Until we get the next push and reach a new equilibrium.\"</p> <p>From now on until June, the Arctic sea ice will refreeze. First it will be glassy, thin \"shuga\", \"grease\" or \"pancake\" ice, unable to bind the floes together. But within weeks, the whole icecap will visibly reform, growing up to 100,000 sq km a day until the melt season begins again next year.</p> <p>But, says Toberg, because of the massive melt this year, there will be less old, or multiyear, ice which is thicker and less prone to melting. The new ice formed this winter will be weaker and more vulnerable to melt, hastening the loss of ice next year. \"It is preconditioned to melt\", he says.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/05/climate-change-feedback-loops\" title=\"\">\"feedbacks\"</a> are thought to be hastening the ice retreat. In recent summers, say ice experts, Arctic sea surface temperatures have been well above normal, partly because there is less ice to reflect heat back into the atmosphere. The darker open waters now absorb more solar radiation, accelerating the melt.</p> <p>\"The ice is weak so it opens up water and allows more sunlight in which warms the water more which makes the ice break up more \u2013 so it accelerates the melt. There is hardly any old, multi-year ice left, so first year ice is now dominant. We are seeing less and less old thick ice,\" says Toberg.</p> <p>The longer term implications of the great melt of 2012 are hard to call, say climate scientists who caution that more research is needed. Sea ice plays a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the sun's energy, helping to cool the Earth.</p> <p>What is suspected is that the formation of the sea ice produces dense salt water which sinks, helping drive the deep ocean currents. Without the summer sea ice, many scientists fear this balance could be upset, potentially causing major climatic changes.</p> <p>\"The Arctic ice cover is a lid on the planet that regulates the temperature. By taking it off you are warming it. Temperatures [everywhere] depend on it,\" says Toberg.</p> <p>Sea ice extent has varied naturally over the decades with some Russian data suggesting similar or even greater ice loss in some local areas in the 1930s. But the models are clear, says Stroeve. If you omit the observed records, keeping CO<sub>2</sub> levels at pre-industrial levels, then none show a decline of ice cover. When you do put CO<sub>2</sub> into the models, they all show a decline, she says.</p> <p>\"Just because there was possibly less ice in some areas at other times, that doesn't mean it's not human-induced now\".</p> <p>\"We can expect the Arctic to be ice-free in summer within 20 years, she says. \"The ice won't go away the whole year. It will still be cold enough in the Arctic to freeze in winter. But by 2030 I'd say we will have an ice-free summer Arctic. That does not mean that natural ice variability cannot bring it back again, but the trend, we think, will be downward.\"</p> <p>\"This is a defining moment in human history,\" said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam. \"In just over 30 years we have altered the way our planet looks from space and soon the north pole may be completely ice-free in summer.</p> <p>\"Fossil fuel companies are still making profits despite the fact that climate change is so clearly upon us. Our politicians are putting corporate interests above scientific warnings and failing in their duties to the public\".</p>",

In 2010 the IUCN 'red list' of threatened species classified the African penguin as endangered because populations were rapidly declining - just seven islands support 80% of the global population. Conservationists attribute the penguins' decline to food shortages, both because of use of large amounts of fish caught commercially and the eastward shift of their main food sources of anchovy and sardines.

  "<p>Back in 2002, when Tom Cruise could keep his peculiarities and PR under control, he starred in the sci-fi whodunit blockbuster film Minority Report. Set in the year 2054, Minority Report offered, among many things, a futuristic portrayal of retail experiences. In the film, Cruise's character, John Anderton, is hurriedly walking through a shopping mall trying to evade capture. While doing so his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQbVD5hlddk\" title=\"\">eyes are being scanned</a> with alarming frequency. With each scan the glass window he is passing by offers up a personally targeted advertisement (best ad: \"John Anderton, you could use a Guinness right about now!\"). In the ten years since the release of the film many of the computer and consumer experiences envisioned have either come to fruition or are on the verge of what's possible. These experiences are being made possible by combining the capabilities of mobile devices and big data.</p> <p>Last week I had the opportunity to attend a workshop in San Francisco presented by SAP on the very subject of the future of mobile, big data, and analytics. Aptly named <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/maribellopez/2012/07/07/the-future-of-mobile-is-right-time-experiences/\" title=\"\">Right Time Experiences</a> (RTE), these contextual experiences take the vast amounts of data available publicly and privately and combine it with real-time information from mobile devices. For consumers this could translate into something as simple as an enhanced shopping experience or as complex as medical services. For businesses it provides the opportunity to engage with clients and products in ways never before possible.</p> <p>A key ingredient to this experience is leveraging the native capabilities of mobile devices. Data from audio, video, GPS, pressure, and biometric sensors can be collected, transmitted, and integrated into a variety of apps on our devices. These mobile inputs maintain a persistent connection to the Internet and provide an almost limitless stream of information. Devices are constantly improving their capabilities. In fact, recent devices have hardware that is sensitive enough to tell when you are moving between floors inside a building.</p> <p>The end result is opportunities that are a breath of fresh air for consumers and businesses alike. For example, the French insurance company Groupama allows customers to start an accident claim, complete with photos and GPS coordinates, from the accident site using a mobile device. Retailer Tesco allows commuters in a Seoul, Korea, metro station to use their mobile devices to <a href=\"http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/16/view/15557/tesco-virtual-supermarket-in-a-subway-station.html\" title=\"\">order and have groceries delivered</a> on their commute home by scanning desired items from a billboard in the station. Experiences such as these provide customers with valuable time savings while granting companies the opportunity to distinguish themselves and build loyalty.</p> <p>What is defined as a connected device can go beyond our common understanding of what mobile is as well. Vitality has a product called <a href=\"http://www.vitality.net/\" title=\"\">GlowCaps</a> that is used on the top of prescription bottles. Vitality GlowCaps flash to remind the user to take their medicine. These caps are connected wirelessly through mobile carriers, like AT&amp;T in the United States, to transmit data to doctors and loved ones every time the cap is removed. These caps allow concerned parties to track whether medicine is being taken according to schedule. They can also refill the patient's prescription automatically.</p> <p>All of these experiences can bring added convenience to our lives, from directions to connections. However, coupled with this capability comes concern that we could be exposing too much personal information. There are apps that push the social boundaries of privacy. For example, the app called <a href=\"http://girlsaround.me/\" title=\"\">Girls Around Me</a> allows users to leverage the social platform FourSquare to see who is in their proximity. <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/facebook/\" title=\"\">Wolfram Alpha</a> aggregates information on your Facebook posts and friends such as age and location. There is even an app named <a href=\"http://ilektrojohn.github.com/creepy/\" title=\"\">Creepy</a>, which is a geolocation information aggregator that takes the data from sources such as Twitter, Flickr, and Foursquare and overlays what was posted and where on an interactive map.</p> <p>The challenge and opportunity is that the greater the diversity of data collected, then the more of a crystal clear outline of who we are can be derived. Taken together, the sum of the data outlines our habits, routines, and daily norms. This data can also clearly show any variations from our routine. This is very powerful data that can be leveraged for life-enhancing experiences. It can also be wielded to gain intrusive insight into our patterns and lifestyle. We are also only scratching the surface in terms of what is possible to collect. As mobile devices become more intimate to our physical being, the opportunity for sensors only grows. Why not track vital signs so you know when you or a loved one are beginning to get sick or taking a turn for the worse? But how much of this personal outline is appropriate for collection and consumption?</p> <p>The data collected is meaningful both on an individual level as well as on a collective basis. Just as deviations from the norm can be used for analysis and functionality on a personal basis, it is almost more powerful when looking at the masses. For example, think of how an indicator, such as the consumer confidence index, could go from its current monthly backwards-looking data point to real time and even predictive stream based on variations of consumer spending that are being constantly gathered. Think of the field day that savvy political campaigns could have with the data collection and analysis capabilities.</p> <p>The collection of so much personal data raises many questions. Who owns this data? The organisations providing the service, or the individual? Is it possible for an individual to opt out of having their data collected? Do consumers have access to their data? Can individuals request to have the data deleted? Who has control of the sale and sharing of your data? The disparate nature of the data across many apps and services makes answering many of these questions a challenge on a global basis.</p> <p>Many years ago, I remember being freaked out the first time I ever got directions from the internet. I entered my address in Seattle on the West Coast of the United States as the starting point and my parents' house on the other side of the country as the destination. Up came turn-by-turn directions to their house some 3,000 miles away. I remember looking at the map and thinking that somehow I was actively spying on them. \"Stalkers are going to have a field day with this,\" I remember telling a friend.</p> <p>Fast-forward to today. We don't think twice about being provided with step-by-step directions from our current location. In fact, giving someone directions could now be classified as a lost art. What once seemed invasive and like spying has become the norm; or as my good friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/miljagillespie\" title=\"\">Milja Gillespie</a> said, \"Creepy is the new cool\". As mobile devices allow for a greater breadth of Right Time Experiences to transpire, what is considered invasive, or creepy, today could just as well morph into the norm of tomorrow.</p> <p>So the question remains: are we being coaxed into handing over too much information? Are we the proverbial frogs sitting in hot water and not noticing the temperature rising? Are we trading convenience over concern? Or is it that we have been raised to think too highly of information as it relates to us? Perhaps our information isn't as important or personal as we believe. Is \"creepy\" just us old curmudgeons not making way for the new? On the plus side, if creepy is the new cool, then perhaps Tom Cruise will someday be able mount a comeback.</p> <p><em>Benjamin Robbins is a principal at Palador.

  "<p>In the wake of the continuing negotiations on climate change in Bangkok last week, businesses need to take action to improve the outcomes for future generations.</p> <p>Number seven of the <a href=\"http://www.unglobalcompact.org/Issues/human_rights/childrens_principles.html\" title=\"\">Children's Rights and Business Principles</a> launched by Unicef earlier this year is related to the environment. This has global relevance for all businesses, since all business activities impact directly or indirectly on the world that our children will inherit.</p> <p>On a recent trip to Bangladesh, I found that climate-related disasters such as flooding were already having an effect on children's lives. The country is making efforts to build multi-purpose cyclone shelters, which are also being used as schools. Yet these cyclone shelters, while necessary, may not be sufficient to protect the children in Bangladesh if the world is heading for global warming of more than 3\u00b0C.</p> <p>The effects of climate change have a disproportionate impact on children as well as other vulnerable groups. Children and women are 14 times more likely to be killed in a disaster. Save the Children has found that half of all those affected in an emergency are children, and that an increase in climate-related disasters would mean millions would die or be forced to flee from their homes.</p> <p>Climate change particularly affects agriculture and contributes to rising food prices. Unfortunately, children are particularly vulnerable to this, since malnutrition is already the underlying contributing factor in about one third of all child deaths. The global food crisis of 2008 had a huge impact on child and infant mortality.</p> <h2>Ecological debt</h2> <p>Like financial debt, ecological debt places a burden on children and future generations. This links to the debate over the recent financial crisis. There have been calls for businesses and investors to consider the triple bottom line of social, environmental, and economic sustainability \u2013 and to reward long-term value creation over the fast buck.</p> <p>At the recent Rio+20 Conference, countries reiterated their commitment to protect the climate \"for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind\". Should companies also consider this principle of intergenerational equity?</p> <p>This principle would mean markets and businesses supply the needs of today, without disregarding the needs of tomorrow. Damaging ecosystems and making species extinct leaves an unwelcome legacy. There is the unsettling possibility that this generation might leave the Earth in a worse state than they found it. The recent study in <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/specials/planetaryboundaries/index.html\" title=\"\">Nature</a> showed humanity may already be overstepping various planetary boundaries, including on biodiversity, nitrogen and climate change. Scientists have also warned that remaining deposits of several irreplaceable and finite mineral resources are being fast depleted.</p> <h2>Sourcing and supply chains</h2> <p>These business-as-usual trends will not just have external impacts, but systemic impacts that harm us all. Recognising the rights of children means companies should consider sourcing from renewable materials, as well as ensuring materials can be re-used, to preserve vital natural resources. Companies with global supply chains may also consider the impact of global operations on vulnerable communities.</p> <p>For example, Fairtrade coffee companies have been working with their producers down the supply chain to help them become more resilient. The Fairtrade Foundation highlights that rising temperatures would be a disaster for the coffee industry. Reducing the vulnerability of children is low-cost, like ensuring a water supply, and can help develop skills across communities over a long time period.</p> <p>In the UN climate talks in Bangkok earlier this month, the governments of high-emitting countries continued to avoid tackling the issue, often citing financial or competitiveness concerns. Yet in an interconnected world, all businesses will be affected by the emerging challenges for water, food and energy under climate change \u2013 of which the 2008 crisis may be a precursor.</p> <p>The challenges for businesses are similar to those for governments and individuals: the tendency to focus on short-term rather than long-term concerns. The recession may have made this more difficult. However, with energy and input prices rising, there are clearly opportunities for businesses that move towards green growth. Innovative circular business models will reduce risks in a world where inputs are constrained.</p> <p>Previously, corporate considerations of impacts on children were mainly limited to concerns about child labour or health. As the world begins to be hit by climate change, water and resource scarcity, as well as financial crisis, business leaders are in the pivotal position to make decisions that consider wider sustainability and respect the rights of children.</p> <p>In the end, relying on growth that degrades basic resources will not only lead to catastrophe for our children but it is not a sustainable business model either.</p> <p><em>Helena Wright is a doctoral researcher at Imperial College London and has attended the UN talks on climate change.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>One October evening, as an autumn chill descends with the darkening sky, a great cloud of bats will rise out of the woods at a pre-arranged signal and dive with their thousands of beating wings down a concrete shaft and into a secure underground bunker, AKA the bat cave.</p> <p>At least, that is what is called for in the script. The structure is an artificial bat cave, believed to be the first of its kind. Conservation groups are looking to the bunker to provide protection against an aggressive new disease that threatens to annihilate North America's bat population.</p> <p>Work on the bat cave, built just over a metre below ground on a hill about 70 miles north-west of Nashville, began in late August, and should wind up this month. For those approaching the structure through the steel doors designated for humans, it feels a bit like entering a tomb. But for North American bats it could provide a shot at survival.</p> <p>As many as 6.7 million North American bats are believed to have been killed by the disease known as white-nose syndrome since its presence was first detected in a New York cave in 2006.</p> <p>The disease has struck in 19 states and four Canadian provinces, wiping out 90% of the population in some caves in the north-east.</p> <p>White-nose arrived in Tennessee last March in two caves used by grey bats, which are classed as an endangered species.</p> <p>\"We were concerned we could lose a couple of species in a year or two,\" said Cory Holliday, the cave expert for the Nature Conservancy in Tennessee, the organisation building the bat cave.</p> <p>The bats' drastic decline has broad implications: the animals eat their weight in mosquitoes and other insects each day. By some estimates, they save American agriculture $3.7bn (\u00a32.3bn) a year.</p> <p>The disease attacks bats during the hibernation season, depositing white fluff on their muzzles and rousing them from their torpor, causing them to burn through fat stores.</p> <p>Researchers say it is caused by a soil fungus, introduced to North America by European hikers. There is, to date, no known treatment.</p> <p>However, some conservationists figured that if they could construct a bat cave free of the fungus that causes the disease, and then decontaminate the area each year, it would be possible to protect bat populations.</p> <p>\"I call it our crazy idea but what if we could just get them out of the cave?\" said Mark Thurman, a wildlife biologist with Tennessee Fish and Wildlife Agency who is credited with coming up with the original plan. \"We had the concept for a while but we were very, very quiet because it was a pretty wacky idea,\" he admitted.</p> <p>But what chance would the bats have if the researchers did nothing?</p> <p>So the conservation group, working with the state wildlife agency, decided to build a bat hibernaculum that could be scrubbed out with ammonia each autumn and spring, keeping the cave clean of the deadly fungus.</p> <p>\"It's easily controllable in a controlled environment. There are lots of things that kill this fungus. But nothing that kills the fungus could be used in a natural cave environment because it would kill everything else and be detrimental to the eco-system,\" Holliday said.</p> <p>Other bat experts agreed. The artificial cave would also provide a chance to study how bats \u2013 and the disease \u2013 react to different temperatures.</p> <p>Made out of pre-cast concrete modules, the cave is about 24 metres long. That size space could easily accommodate 200,000 bats. \"But I'd be happy with 10,000 to 15,000,\" Holliday said.</p> <p>The cave was engineered to draw a continual supply of winter air from a concrete shaft to provide the chilly temperatures favoured by hibernating bats. Stale air is released through a chimney.The shaft also serves as the entrance for the bats.</p> <p>The ceiling is scored with ridges and rough edges, the better to give bat claws a tight grip. Walls are lined with sheets of open mesh and fine screens \u2013 even a slab of board, with a gap for crevice-loving bats to roost in.</p> <p>There is no electric ventilation system. The Nature Conservancy said it wanted to keep costs down \u2013 this cave cost $300,000. Electric cooling systems would be too costly to run and potentially risky if there was a power failure. But there will be three surveillance cameras with infrared imaging, allowing researchers to monitor bat movements.</p> <p>If the bat cave works, it could provide a rescue plan across North America. \"This is a working prototype. Others could use it,\" Holliday said.</p> <p>But there are no guarantees the bats will even deign to use the artificial space.</p> <p>\"It's a neat idea for sure but the trick will be seeing whether bats will use it first of all. The second thing will be seeing how they regulate the micro-climate inside, which is super-important for bat hibernation,\" said Craig Willis, a bat expert at the University of Winnipeg.</p> <p>Bats are used to built-up environments \u2013 they regularly use abandoned mine shafts. But getting the bats to put this particular cave on their radar could be tricky.</p> <p>The Nature Conservancy deliberately sited their bunker a few steps away from a natural cave, used by tens of thousands of bats each winter.</p> <p>Holliday also plans to play recordings of bat calls, inaudible to humans, once the creatures start to swarm.</p> <p>The biggest challenge, however, will be maintaining the right temperature and humidity \u2013 especially this year.</p> <p>A construction delay means the cement blocks of the bunker are still emitting heat, making the temperature a comfortable 17Cwhich is too hot for hibernating bats, who prefer temperatures in the 2-9C range.</p> <p>Holliday was planning to bring in two air-conditioning units this week to try to cool down the cave before the swarming season. Like the effort to find a cure for white-nose syndrome, it's a race against time.</p> <p>\"A lot of us are just crossing our fingers at this point,\" said Holliday.</p>",
  "<p>Japan has announced plans to end its reliance on nuclear power within 30 years, in a historic policy shift prompted by the triple meltdown at the Fukushima power plant.</p> <p>The move to close all 50 of the country's functioning reactors by around 2040 marks a dramatic change of course by a country that had previously championed atomic energy, putting Japan alongside Germany and Switzerland, which also turned away from nuclear power following the disaster.</p> <p>Japan, the world's third biggest user of nuclear power before the disaster, had planned to increase nuclear's share of the energy mix to 50% by 2030. But the country's attachment to nuclear power was severely weakened after the Fukushima accident sent radioactive materials into the ocean and atmosphere, contaminated the food and water supply, and forced the evacuation of 160,000 residents.</p> <p>\"Based on facing the reality of this grave accident and by learning lessons from the accident, the government has decided to review the national energy strategy from scratch,\" read a policy document released on Friday. \"One of the key pillars of the new strategy is to achieve a society that does not depend on nuclear energy as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>The decision comes after two months of public consultations and the largest anti-nuclear demonstrations Japan has ever seen. Local media reports said the cabinet had already agreed to approve the panel's recommendation, with a formal announcement expected soon.</p> <p>The plan calls for renewable energy to comprise about 30% of Japan's future energy mix \u2013 an eightfold rise from 2010 levels \u2013 and the development of sustainable ways to use fossil fuels.</p> <p>In the short-term, however, the shift will force Japan to increase its already heavy dependence on oil and natural gas, calling into question its ability to reach internationally agreed CO2 emissions targets.</p> <p>\"This is a strategy to create a new future,\" a policy statement said, after key ministers finalised the decision on Friday. \"It is not pie in the sky. It is a practical strategy.\"</p> <p>The report says Japan should aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 20% from 1990 levels and to reduce energy consumption through greater efficiency by about 10% from 2010 levels.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners welcomed the decision, but said the phase-out should have come much earlier. \"The government's strategy involves a nuclear phase-out nearly two decades later than needed,\" said Kazue Suzuki, Greenpeace Japan nuclear campaigner. \"It also provides clarity for the business community that renewable power, not nuclear, is the future.</p> <p>\"For too long Japan's leaders have ignored their people and gambled the health, safety and economic stability of every citizen on nuclear power, and as the people of Fukushima continue to suffer, so does the rest of our country. This announcement must become law, otherwise it will be seen as nothing but lip service to buy votes before the coming election.\"</p> <p>The report does not specify how the expensive shift to renewables would be funded, or how to minimise the environmental impact of greater fossil fuel use.</p> <p>The prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, will be hoping that the decision boosts support for his unpopular administration ahead of a general election expected in November. Recent opinion polls showed most Japanese preferred a phase out over two other options proposed by the government that gave nuclear a limited role.</p> <p>\"We are only at the starting line,\" Noda said. \"Now we are going to begin an extremely difficult challenge. No matter how difficult it is, we can no longer put it off.\"</p> <p>However, if, as many expect, Noda's party is replaced by a more conservative administration after the next election, there is no guarantee that the no-nuclear policy will survive.</p> <p>Japan was briefly without nuclear power earlier this year after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-closure\" title=\"\">all 50 working reactors were closed</a> for safety checks.</p> <p>No restarts were permitted until the reactors passed stress tests introduced in the wake of the Fukushima crisis and gained the approval of local authorities.</p> <p>The move away from nuclear has caused concern among Japan's allies. Japan provides nuclear technology expertise to companies in the US, while France and Britain, which reprocess its spent nuclear fuel, have sought assurances that it will continue to accept high-level radioactive waste created by reprocessing.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/03/japan-nuclear-power-closure\" title=\"\">Noda approved the restart of two reactors</a> in western Japan amid fears that the country would experience power cuts during the summer.</p> <p>He has come under sustained pressure from business leaders not to abandon nuclear, amid warnings that power shortfalls and the high cost of renewables could stifle production and derail attempts to kick-start the country's export-led economy.</p> <p>But some analysts said a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/fukushima-disaster-new-geothermal-plants\" title=\"\">serious shift towards renewables</a> could benefit the economy. \"A total exit from nuclear is positive for the economy, on balance,\" said Andrew Dewit, a professor at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. \"It incentivises Japan's political economy to focus on efficiency and renewables. Japan lags in both these areas and they offer the greatest opportunities for growth.\"</p> <p>The phase-out will be achieved by retiring reactors, which were built between the early 1970s and 2006, when they reach the end of an agreed 40-year life span. The report said, however, that some could be restarted before they are closed permanently provided their safety is confirmed by a new regulatory body.</p> <p>\"We will launch all possible policy measures to achieve a nuclear-free society by the 2030s,\" the report said. \"Until the total phase-out we will only use nuclear reactors that are confirmed safe.\"</p>",

  "<h2>OUR IMPERFECT COUSINS</h2> <p>$exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and Shortbread McFiver, the Fiver's tiresome stereotypical cousins, are the only two people in Great Britain who still actively enjoy international football. Or so it seems. Unlike you, or us, they weren't counting down every effing second of last week's break for the World Cup qualifiers with a desperate impatience for the club game to return. But perhaps the reason for that is not just down to the football itself.</p> <p>$exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver went to Moldova, where, in celebration of England's 5-0 win, he drank twice as much as he usually does, knocking back one pint of his favourite real ale, Unamusing Monicker, then promptly boaking it up all down his vintage Admiral shirt. The resulting six-day hangover caused him to miss his flight home, and the midweek Ukraine match, and as a result he's still under the erroneous impression that Mr Roy is actually having some sort of positive effect on the team. Shortbread McFiver, meanwhile, travelled north to Glasgow, where by Thursday morning he and several of his pals had assembled a large collection of objects of assorted shape and sharpness, with the intention of tearing Craig Levein another aperture through which to communicate his needlessly baroque tactical blueprints. But before McFiver and his buddies left to carry out the job, one of the clan mentioned the nutritional benefits of a hearty breakfast, briefly departed, then hoved back into view with a tray of morning pints, and all momentum was lost.</p> <p>And so it was that both $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and Shortbread McFiver arrived back home this morning with sore heads and the fear. Oh for another week on the road! As they turned the key to the front door of Fiver Mansions, they knew what was coming. It was time to face the music. They were due a thrashing. And a thrashing was indeed immediately dispensed by Granny Fiver, angry that she had to wash $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver's shirt, and positively livid that Shortbread McFiver had not carried out the Levein hit. And she tanned their sorry hides with a frying pan, issuing constructive criticism and other lifestyle recommendations while doing so.</p> <p>As the blows rained down on $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and Shortbread McFiver, the pair reflected that Republic O'Ireland spare part James McClean will also be heading home to Sunderland with some trepidation, fearing a similar reception. For the young buffoon made a terrible error by joining Twitter, that vainglorious travesty, and then compounded the mistake by actually using it. Having flung the toys from the pram at being left on the bench in Kazakhstan by Giovanni O'Trapattoni, he's now got to face the wrath of his club manager, Martin O'Neill. \"It's good when the player not only wants to play but also wants to manage the team as well,\" hissed O'Neill, employing mild sarcasm without once raising his voice, a time-honoured tactic of professional gangsters, psychological sadists, and parents. \"He has a bit of a problem with Twitter and we will have to rectify it.\"</p> <p>With the Premier League kicking back into action this weekend, there will be other nervous reintroductions and confrontations \u2013 England's Brave John Terry, Ashley Cole and Anton Ferdinand will be forced to go through another of those pointless handshake absurdities at Loftus Road, while at the Britannia Stadium poor Michael Owen will be corralled into contact with a football \u2013 but it's McClean who is likely to feel the most pain. Apart from $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver and Shortbread McFiver, that is. And Granny Fiver, if her gleeful cries of \"this hurts me more than it hurts you\" each and every time she swings that skillet are anything to go by.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"I spoke to our secretary [last] Friday and said that I'd play, but we'd have to keep it from my wife\" \u2013 57-year-old John Dent, manager of Cornish side Penzance, who played himself in goal against Liverton Town during last weekend's Peninsula League clash after a goalkeeping crisis.

Everything in the article was absolutely correct apart from one thing, Vojvodina is certainly not third (or even second, for that matter), our club is without a doubt first as far as badly-run clubs in Europe are concerned.

  "<p>At the Louis Vuitton flagship store on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, the Japanese tourists were jostling over the famous monogrammed leather bags like they were going out of fashion.</p> <p>France may be caught up in the global economic crisis, but there is no sign of it here.</p> <p>Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy is a leader in a still-flourishing luxury goods market and its chief executive, Bernard Arnault, is in the enviable position of being the richest man in France.</p> <p>Louis Vuitton is a French success story, which should make Arnault something of a local hero. Instead, the tycoon was treated like a social pariah this week after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/11/baron-rothschild-arnault-taxes-france\" title=\"\">accusations that he was trying to reduce his tax bill</a> by seeking Belgian citizenship.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396179318\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347643463898/Tax-rates-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tax rates\" width=\"220\" height=\"477\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The highest and lowest tax rates in the world. Photograph: Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The news that the billionaire businessman might head to the land of <em>moules-frites</em> generated headlines, insults, a lawsuit and divided France roughly down right-left lines: those who saw Arnault as a symbol of the \"selfish rich\" and those who saw him as a standard bearer for the tax-bludgeoned entrepreneur trying to create jobs and wealth.</p> <p>Arnault, 63, a friend of former rightwing president Nicolas Sarkozy (he was a witness at Sarkozy's second marriage), denied he was planning to up sticks to get out of paying a new 75% \"supertax\" on the rich, one of the vote-winning pillars of Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's election campaign in May.</p> <p>The explanation from an LVMH spokesman was that Arnault was seeking dual citizenship to make \"sensitive\" investments in Belgium, a response shot down by the Belgian authorities who said foreign investors enjoy the same fiscal treatment as locals.</p> <p>Living in Belgium, which Arnault \u2013 net worth an estimated at $24.4bn (\u00a315bn), <a href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/bloomberg-billionaires-index/\" title=\"\">according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a> \u2013 said he had no intention of doing, would conveniently free him of French taxes on income, inheritance and wealth.</p> <p>However, the mayor of Uccle, a chic suburb of Brussels where Arnault has a property, said the billionaire had voiced his unhappiness with the French tax system even before the presidential election.</p> <p>\"Mr Arnault came to see me at the end of last year, wanting to be domiciled here, to live here,\" Mayor Armand de Decker told the newspaper La Libre Belgique. \"He has a feeling about the policies of his country, which he considers unfriendly to business.\"</p> <p>Was Arnault paving the way to Monte Carlo, the French press wondered. The route to Monaco via Belgium is a well-trodden one: once he had dual nationality, the businessman could theoretically renounce his French citizenship and move to the Riviera principality where Belgian nationals \u2013 but not French citizens \u2013 can live tax-free.</p> <p>Shortly before the Arnault scandal erupted, the businessman had met the French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, to tell him exactly what he thought of the new tax band. A week ago, Hollande went on television to reiterate: the 75% tax band for those earning over \u20ac1m (\u00a3810,000) was on its way.</p> <p>\"There will be no exceptions,\" he said. \"Everyone has to make an effort, play their part. We all have to be patriots. especially them [those earning over \u20ac1ma year].\"</p> <p>A 75% tax band will give France the highest tax rate in Europe \u2013 overtaking Sweden \u2013 and possibly the world (tax burdens are complicated to calculate).</p> <p>Hollande has also warned that households will have to come up with an extra \u20ac10bn to help bring down the country's public deficit.</p> <p>The president, who once admitted: \"I don't like the rich\", certainly has France's wealthiest citizens in his sights, but the French middle class is likely to be pummelled too.</p> <p>As well as the new 75% tax, a 45% band is to be introduced on incomes over \u20ac150,000 a year (up from 41%) and households will be limited to a maximum \u20ac10,000 savings on tax reduction schemes (down from \u20ac18,000).</p> <p>France is also looking to beef up its \"wealth tax\", imposed on households with assets worth more than \u20ac1.3m including their main home. The threshold for inheritance tax has already been lowered from \u20ac150,000 to \u20ac100,000, a move expected to raise around \u20ac2.5bn by 2014, and there are moves afoot to raise the rate of capital gains tax.</p> <p>Even low earners will pay more income tax after the household allowance (the same as the personal allowance, only applied to families not individuals) is reduced from \u20ac2,336 to \u20ac2,000 a year.</p> <p>Hollande is also said to be considering a fiscal law, similar to that in the US, under which French taxpayers would be subject to French taxes even if they leave the country.</p> <p>For Socialists, the 75% supertax is considered the vote-winner in May's presidential and legislative elections. Even though a small number of French people, probably fewer than 30,000 in a country of 64 million, will be affected, it is hugely symbolic for the leftwing president and his administration.</p> <p>However, Jean-Philippe Delsol, a tax lawyer and member of the IREF economic thinktank which supports \"economic freedom\", says the tax is populist and plays on a historic Gallic antipathy to the rich.</p> <p>\"If you are wealthy in the UK, there is no hate. There may be envy and scorn, but there is no hate, real hate like there is in France. We like everyone to be the same and if they are different we detest them,\" Delsol said.</p> <p>\"Maybe it's because we are a Catholic country and have a lot of rural people who don't like the rich, or because of the idea of egalitarianism that came out of the French revolution, or from Marxism that gained a hold in France.\"</p> <p>Critics like Delsol say the tax will halt the \"economic flux\" necessary for growth and will have the opposite effect to that needed.</p> <p>France, like the UK, already has its tax exiles, including the former Victoria's Secret model Laetitia Casta, the multi-starred restaurateur Alain Ducasse and singer Johnny Hallyday, who like Arnault, caused a storm by seeking Belgian nationality. Hallyday, whose real name is Smet, was turned down by Brussels even though his father was Belgian, and instead moved to Switzerland.</p> <p>Delsol believes many more could follow. \"Even Henry IV's minister Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my de Laffemas in the 16th century understood that high taxes kill the total revenues. And there is an enormous risk people will leave the country.\"</p> <p>Delsol said that last year his law firm had dealt with five cases of French people seeking to go abroad for tax reasons. The threat of a 75% supertax tripled that number.</p> <p>\"In just the first four months of this year we had 15 clients who are leaving or want to leave France. And it's a different type of person. Before we'd have businessmen selling up to go into retirement and wanting to go to Belgium or Switzerland, where they don't have to pay capital gains tax.</p> <p>\"Today it's younger people, 40- to 48-year-olds, new entrepreneurs with lots of energy who have already made money and want to make more, which they don't want to have taken by the French tax authorities.</p> <p>\"They are going to Brazil, Luxembourg \u2026 anywhere but France, and that is bad news for this country.</p> <p>\"It's not just about tax either, it's the climate. People who are making money in France are fed up with being despised.\"</p> <p>The office of Pierre Moscovici, the French finance minister, did not respond to a Guardian request for information about how much income the new 75% supertax would generate. But Hollande and his administration, it seems, are prepared to risk an entrepreneurial brain drain.</p> <p>Asked about Arnault during a television interview, the president replied: \"He should have taken into account what it means to be French. We are a big country, with lots of advantages and history. We are proud to be French. We have to call on patriotism at this time \u2026 to ask for an effort in the battle against debt.\"</p> <p>As the American economist and politician Charles Wheelan claimed in his book Naked Economics: \"France is a good place to be a struggling artist, and a bad place to be an internet entrepreneur\".</p>",

  "<p>The world's high-income countries are in economic trouble, mostly related to growth and employment, and now their distress is spilling over to developing economies. What factors underlie today's problems, and how appropriate are the likely policy responses?</p> <p>The first key factor is deleveraging and the resulting shortfall in aggregate demand. Since the financial crisis began in 2008, several developed countries, having sustained demand with excessive leverage and consumption, have had to repair both private and public balance sheets, which takes time \u2013 and has left them impaired in terms of growth and employment.</p> <p>The non-tradable side of any advanced economy is large (roughly two-thirds of total activity). For this large sector, there is no substitute for domestic demand. The tradable side could make up some of the deficit, but it is not large enough to compensate fully. In principal, governments could bridge the gap, but high (and rising) debt constrains their capacity to do so (though how constrained is a matter of heated debate).</p> <p>The bottom line is that deleveraging will ensure that growth will be modest at best in the short and medium term. If Europe deteriorates, or there is gridlock in dealing with America's \"fiscal cliff\" at the beginning of 2013 (when tax cuts expire and automatic spending cuts kick in), a major downturn will become far more likely.</p> <p>The second factor underlying today's problems relates to investment. Longer-term growth requires investment by individuals (in education and skills), governments, and the private sector. Shortfalls in investment eventually diminish growth and employment opportunities. The hard truth is that the flip side of the consumption-led growth model that prevailed prior to the crisis has been deficient investment, particularly on the public sector side.</p> <p>If fiscal rebalancing is accomplished in part by cutting investment, medium- and longer-term growth will suffer, resulting in fewer employment opportunities for younger labour-market entrants. Sustaining investment, on the other hand, has an immediate cost: it means deferring consumption.</p> <p>But whose consumption? If almost everyone agrees that more investment is needed to elevate and sustain growth, but most believe that someone else should pay for it, investment will fall victim to a burden-sharing impasse \u2013 reflected in the political process, electoral choices, and the formulation of fiscal-stabilisation measures.</p> <p>The core issue is taxes. If public-sector investment were to be increased with no rise in taxation, the budget cuts required elsewhere to avoid unsustainable debt growth would be implausibly large.</p> <p>The most difficult challenge concerns inclusiveness \u2013 how the benefits of growth are to be distributed. This is a longstanding challenge that, particularly in the United States, goes back at least two decades before the crisis; left unaddressed, it now threatens social cohesion.</p> <p>Income growth for the middle class in most advanced countries has been stagnant, and employment opportunities have been declining, especially in the tradable part of the economy. The share of income going to capital has been rising, at the expense of labour. Particularly in the US, employment generation has been disproportionately in the non-tradable sector.</p> <p>These trends reflect a combination of technological and global market forces that have been operating over the last two decades. On the technology side, labour-saving innovations in network-based information processing and transactions automation have helped to drive a wedge between growth and employment generation in both the tradable and non-tradable sectors.</p> <p>In the tradable part of advanced economies, manufacturing automation \u2013 including expanding robotic capabilities and, prospectively, 3D printing \u2013 has combined with the integration of millions of new entrants into rapidly evolving global supply chains to limit employment growth. Multinational companies' growing ability to decompose these global supply chains by function and geography, and then to reintegrate them at ever lower transaction costs, removes the labor-market protection that used to come from local competition for workers.</p> <p>This challenge is particularly difficult, because economic policy has not focused primarily on the adverse distributional trends arising from shifting global market outcomes. And yet the income distributions across advanced economies, presumably subject to similar technological and global market forces, are, in fact, startlingly different, suggesting that a combination of social policies and differing social norms does have a distributional impact. Although the theory of optimal income taxation directly addresses the tradeoffs between efficiency incentives and distributional consequences, the appropriate equilibrium remains a long way off.</p> <p>A healthy state balance sheet could help, because part of the income flowing to capital would go to the state. But, with the exception of China, fiscal positions around the world are currently weak.</p> <p>As a result, deleveraging remains a clear priority in a range of countries, reducing growth, with fiscal countermeasures limited by high or rising government debt and deficits. Thus far, there is little evidence of willingness on the part of politicians, policymakers, and perhaps the public to reduce current consumption further via taxation in order to create room for expanded growth-oriented investment.</p> <p>In fact, under fiscal pressure, the opposite is more likely. In the US, few practical measures that address the distributional challenge appear to be part of either major party's electoral agenda, notwithstanding rhetoric to the contrary.</p> <p>To the extent that this is true of other advanced economies, the global economy faces an extended multi-year period of low growth, with residual downside risk coming from policy gridlock and mistakes in Europe, the US, and elsewhere. That scenario implies slower growth \u2013 possibly 1-1.5 percentage points slower \u2013 in developing countries, including China, again with a preponderance of downside risk.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate, 2012.</a></p>",

  "<p>The general consensus among most people who went to see The Avengers earlier this year was that of all the colourful superpowered mega-titans on display in Joss Whedon's genre-defining comic-book ensemble, Mark Ruffalo's Hulk was the one who absolutely smashed it. Imbuing the great green rage-monster's alter ego Bruce Banner with a gentle, resigned tristesse, rather than the rampant (and ultimately boring) torment that both Eric Bana and Ed Norton's takes seemed to suffer from, Ruffalo left space for the character's comic side to emerge and fuelled talk of a new standalone Hulk movie.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/01/mark-ruffalo-hulk-six-movie-deal\" title=\"\">the actor is signed on to star in five more films for Marvel studios</a>, many expected that proposition to be one of the first to emerge in the wake of The Avengers' blockbuster success. With the film having passed the $1.5bn mark last month, secondly only to James Cameron's Avatar and Titanic in terms of all-time grosses, execs have been greenlighting comic-book movies like spandex is going out of fashion. As well as sequels to Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and The Avengers itself, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/aug/24/week-in-geek-marvel-guardians-of-galaxy\" title=\"\">Marvel last month saw fit to put the offbeat and little known Guardians of the Galaxy into production</a>. But still, no announcement of a new Hulk movie.</p> <p>Interviewed at the Toronto film festival, where he is promoting his new film Thanks for Sharing, Ruffalo appeared to suggest that Marvel have given up on the idea after both Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003 and Louis Leterrier's The Incredible Hulk in 2008 failed to set the world on fire.</p> <p>\"I think they've done it. I think they feel that they've done that,\" <a href=\"http://splashpage.mtv.com/2012/09/12/mark-ruffalo-hulk-future/\" title=\"\">Ruffalo told MTV News</a>. \"I think they don't really know where to go [with the character].\"</p> <p>If true, this looks to me like a rather admirable admission of failure. The character does seem to need other figures to bounce off on the big screen: all the best laughs in The Avengers featured CGI Ruffalo's no-nonsense, brutal and bombastic entanglements with friends and enemies alike, so perhaps he's better used for cameo appearances in films driven by other comic-book heroes. The Hulk's personality, it seems, only really blooms when he has to deal with other people.</p> <p>Perhaps Sad Hulk, as we'll call him, belongs on the small screen, wandering miserably around small town America to the strains of the 1970s TV series' maudlin end credits theme. Fans of the Lou Ferrigno era will be pleased to note that <a href=\"http://screenrant.com/abc-hulk-television-show-jessica-jones-yman-171924/\" title=\"\">there are plans afoot to create a new show</a>, though Ruffalo does not seem likely to be involved. Have producers made the right call here?</p> <p>Elsewhere in the rapidly expanding Marvel universe this week, rumours abound that Doctor Strange may turn up in Thor: The Dark World (the upcoming Thor sequel). Some reports had suggested that none other than Viggo Mortensen himself might be set to portray the cosmic sorcerer,<a href=\"http://twitter.com/RogerWardell\" title=\"\"> a story emanating from the Twitter account of one Roger Wardell</a>, who has been furiously tweeting rumours about a whole range of Marvel upcoming projects for months. People began listening when his prediction that <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/anthony-mackie-captain-america-sequel-349622\" title=\"\">Falcon would be appearing in Captain America: The Winter Soldier was confirmed elsewhere</a>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Marvel executive Victoria Alonso has shot down any suggestion that Mortensen is involved with upcoming projects, which would, it has to be said, have been a pretty impressive coup. \"We would love to work with Viggo Mortensen. I've been trying that for years,\"<a href=\"http://www.worstpreviews.com/headline.php?id=26079&amp;count=0\" title=\"\"> she told Worst Previews</a>. \"But I don't know if Viggo is even acting anymore. I thought he wasn't acting anymore. It would be great to work with him in the future, but we don't have him signed, no.\"</p> <p>It's nevertheless intriguing to note some of Wardell's other \"exclusives\". Apparently, The Mandarin will be the main villain in Iron Man 3, and Marvel are seriously considering getting Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts to pull on a power suit in the same film.

  "<p>As the market continues to motor ahead following the US Federal Reserve's latest quantitative easing plans, transport group <strong>Stagecoach</strong> is in the slow lane.</p> <p>Its shares have dipped 1.7p to 289.3p after Citigroup moved its recommendation from buy to neutral, after the company's recent price rise. Stagecoach owns 49% of Virgin Rail which recently lost out to FirstGroup in the battle for the next franchise for the West Coast Mainline, amid much controversy. Citi said:</p> <blockquote> Since 1 April Stagecoach has gained 14% versus its peers at 9% to falls of 7%. We do not see sufficient upside in non-rail businesses to support a further increase in valuation and higher target price. <br> We see limited scope for Stagecoach to outperform further in the near term \u2014 without an assumption of success in bidding for new UK rail franchises. We believe the disagreements that have followed the West Coast franchise award are a timely illustration of the hazards in assuming future potential value from UK rail.  UK bus also faces significant headwinds in recovering with higher post-hedge fuel costs through fare increases in a tough economic environment. In North America we expect the acquisition of parts of Coach US to accelerate the expansion of Megabus North America, but not to the point where a meaningful earnings contribution is evident and as such the value of a business with great potential could to be more explicitly reflected in our Stagecoach valuation. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>National Express</strong> has accelerated 5.8p to 229.3p after Citi moved from neutral to buy:</p> <blockquote> We see medium term upside that does not rest on UK rail franchises \u2014 with the real risk that terms prove to be unrealistic. Key divisions can broaden. The acquisition of Peterman gives a platform to expand in asset light US transit and paratransit markets with scope for Coach to enter new markets in Europe. <br> </blockquote>",
  "<p>An independent UK aid watchdog has defended the British government's response to the famine and food crisis in the Horn of Africa. The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) said the Department for International Development (DfID) could have done more to anticipate and respond to the emergency, but still performed \"relatively well\".</p> <p>Governments and aid agencies came under fire earlier this year for failing to react more swiftly to warnings of a likely emergency in the region, where more than 12 million people were affected by food shortages after rains failed in late 2010 and early 2011.</p> <p>Oxfam and Save the Children <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/east-africa-drought-disaster-report\" title=\"\">criticised the delayed response</a> to the crisis, saying swifter action could have prevented the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://icai.independent.gov.uk/2012/09/14/icai-report-on-the-uk-emergency-response-in-the-horn-of/\" title=\"\">an ICAI report published on Friday</a> awarded the UK government's \u00a3200m emergency response a \"green-amber\" rating, signifying that it performed \"relatively well\" against criteria for effectiveness and \"value for money\".</p> <p>The report acknowledged that DfID should have been better prepared and could have done more to anticipate the emergency, but argued future crises will be better handled only if weaknesses in the global humanitarian system are addressed and donors work more closely with national governments.</p> <p>DfID and other donor agencies were faulted for lacking flexibile mechanisms to release funds and scale up programmes in response to crises. This, said the report, meant that by the time DfID responded to the unfolding emergency, \"the focus had to be on protecting lives and livelihoods\".</p> <p>The report said DfID's humanitarian staff spent too much time and effort working on press releases and review documents for Andrew Mitchell, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/04/andrew-mitchell-justine-greening-uk-development\" title=\"\">former UK development secretary</a>, who had to sign off all emergency spending.</p> <p>\"The UK made a real and positive difference to the lives of millions of women, men and children in dire need in the Horn of Africa. DfID now need[s] to address the recurring crisis in the region and build sustainability and resilience to work towards longer term solutions,\" said ICAI chief commissioner Graham Ward.</p> <p>However, the report pushed back against previous criticisms of the humanitarian response, arguing the situation on the ground was \"more complex\" than agencies have suggested and that there were \"varying views about the quality and coherence of early warning indicators\". To rectify this, it called on DfID to push for a more effective and coherent early-warning system, drawing together the various sources of information available.</p> <p>At the same time, the report suggested that donors shouldn't always act immediately.</p> <p>There is a \"challenging trade-off\", it said, between acting quickly to save lives and pushing for national governments and other donors to take some responsibility for the crisis response, which would help to ensure UK taxpayers get value for money.</p> <p>\"Our view is that it was appropriate to push for national ownership before significantly scaling up,\" said the report's authors. \"Earlier action could have undermined the government and perpetuated a culture of donor dependency. Once national ownership was secured, however, DfID was likely to have had more impact by taking the lead rather than waiting to get other donors on board.\"</p> <p>ICAI evaluators spent two weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia assessing DfID's work but, due to security concerns, did not visit Somalia or the refugee camps near the Somali border.</p> <p>Set up last year by Mitchell, ICAI has published 13 evaluations of different programmes. It has awarded eight green-amber ratings but no green scores.</p> <p>A DfID spokesperson said the agency is \"already working to strengthen early-warning systems and help people to cope with regular droughts across the region and beyond,\" but added: \"Britain cannot do this alone. We will use this valuable report to strengthen our own work, and press the international community to avoid future crises.\"</p> <p>While the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/03/famine-somalia-over-says-un\" title=\"\">UN formally declared the famine in Somalia over</a> in February, more than 2 million people are still thought to be in crisis. \"Overall, despite the recent improvements, the humanitarian situation in Somalia remains critical and must remain on the global agenda to avoid the risk of reversing the gains made,\" Jens Laerke, of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jv_BdHkABObQuEibSGk2u5rby1Rw?docId=CNG.f0d83e805c19d696138adbc8d99f2154.6e1\" title=\"\">told reporters</a> this week.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2012.

  "<p>There's trouble brewing in Canada.</p> <p>It's difficult to perceive on first glance. In Toronto, the air is clean, crime rates are low and healthcare is universal. Yet an undercurrent of anxiety courses through the country's public discourse and its media; it dominates conversations in coffee shops and university hallways. A volley of recent polarising political developments has led many Canadians to ask whether their country's reputation as a tolerant, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/canada-carbon-emission-targets\" title=\"\">environmentally conscious</a> international peacemaker is suddenly in doubt.</p> <p>A harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants has belied the notion of a country open to incomers. Quebec has elected a separatist provincial government, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/quebec-separatists-election-victory-shooting\" title=\"\">triggering political violence</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/20/canada-eu-tar-sands\" title=\"\">extraction of oil from the vast tar sands</a> of Alberta has proven hugely controversial, as has the marginalisation of the country's First Nations indigenous people. In foreign policy, Canada is increasingly toeing the US line, most recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/08/iran-hostile-canada-severs-diplomatic\" title=\"\">cutting diplomatic ties with Iran</a>. And its Afghanistan deployment has been tainted by allegations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/20/canada-allegations-complicit-torture-afghanistan\" title=\"\">complicity in the torture of detainees</a>.</p> <p>Some, though not all, of this tendency has been blamed on the country's conservative leadership, which gained a parliamentary majority in May last year. The prime minister, Stephen Harper, has tightened immigration policy, struck a hard line in the Middle East and adjusted environmental policy to encourage controversial oil extraction programmes in the country's vast northern hinterlands.</p> <p>\"Everybody knew that Harper would have a different agenda from that of the Liberals,\" said Herb Grubel, a professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University and former member of parliament. \"What he has been doing is putting into effect some of these ideas.\"</p> <h2>Immigration</h2> <p>Canada is one of the few countries in the world that still looks to immigration as a tool for nation-building \u2013 <a href=\"http://maytree.com/policy/research-reference\" title=\"\">20% of Canadians were born abroad</a>, and new immigrants add 0.8% to the country's population each year. Multiculturalism has been a formal policy since 1971; it's taught in the country's elementary schools.Yet over the past year immigration authorities have radically adjusted the criteria for successful applications and cut resettlement programmes en masse. In June, Ottawa provoked a firestorm of controversy \u2013 and sparked a spate of doctors' protests \u2013 when it eliminated all but the most basic healthcare for certain refugee groups. Last week, immigration minister Jason Kenney announced that <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-revoking-citizenship-of-more-than-3000-after-fraud-investigation/article4532222/\" title=\"\">3,100 people would have their Canadian citizenship revoked</a> for hiring immigration consultants to falsify their documents. Eleven thousand aspiring citizens are still under investigation.\"There's a lot that we need to fix pronto, otherwise the message goes out to the world that we're not a welcoming place,\" said Ratna Omidvar, president of Toronto-based immigration foundation Maytree.</p> <p>Since 2006, the <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1147060--canadian-citizenship-rejections-have-more-than-doubled-since-2006\" title=\"\">refusal rate for Canadian citizenship</a> applications has doubled; the number of immigrants from Asian countries such as <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/Immigration-applications-to-Canada-drop-in-Asian-countries/articleshow/13165547.cms\" title=\"\">China and India has halved</a>.</p> <p>Some analysts say the changes point to a deep-rooted, yet widely ignored undercurrent of racism in Canadian society. In late August, news leaked that the Bank of Canada had removed an east Asian-looking woman from preliminary designs of its new $100 bill, <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/canadians-ask-why-design-of-100-bill-replaced-asian-woman-with-white-one/\" title=\"\">replacing her with a caucasian</a>. Chinese groups were outraged, causing the bank to issue a public apology.</p> <p>\"Fighting racism in the States is like punching a brick wall, but fighting it in Canada is like punching a marshmallow \u2013 it always melds back to the same shape,\" said Minelle Mahtani, a professor at University of Toronto Scarborough. \"We live in an ostrich-head-in-the-sand-like denial that racism exists in this country, and yet systemic discrimination is the norm.\"</p> <h2>Quebec</h2> <p>Intolerance is also rife in francophone Quebec, which elected the separatist Parti Quebecois leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/quebec-elections-minority-government-shootings\" title=\"\">Pauline Marois as premier</a> on 4 September. Marois's ascent to power has been shadowed by violence: a man shot two people at the Montreal convention centre where her party was celebrating its victory, killing one and leaving the other in a critical condition. \"The English are waking up!\" the man shouted in French during his arrest, eliciting widespread soul-searching about the depth of the province's linguistic divide.</p> <p>Quebec was already reeling from a spring full of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/canada-student-fee-protest-arrests\" title=\"\">huge student-led street demonstrations</a>. The movement, often referred to as the \"maple spring\", began as a smattering of peaceful protests against tuition fee hikes. But when the then incumbent Liberal administration passed an emergency law to crack down on demonstrators, simmering discontent exploded into full-blown dissent. At the height of the movement, almost 1,000 protesters were arrested in a 400,000-strong Montreal march, some of them as young as 15.</p> <p>Analysts say that Marois is unlikely to hold a referendum on independence \u2013 she is fighting from a minority position and popular support for secession has waned since Quebec's last referendum in 1995.</p> <p>Yet she has invited controversy by proposing measures that would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/parti-quebecois-shooting-fears\" title=\"\">restrict freedom of language and religion</a> in the province. Her promise to strengthen Quebec's French language charter would restrict access for some groups to English junior colleges. Her \"secularism policy\" would ban religious symbols such as headscarves, skullcaps and hijabs in public offices. Yet it would allow crucifixes, which, according to Marois, symbolise traditional Quebec culture.</p> <p>\"There is still a large group of ethnic nationalists who believe that Quebec should be for the pure-wool francophones who founded this province,\" said Bruce Hicks, a professor of political science at Concordia University in Montreal. \"Pauline Marois, out of deference to this more extremist group in her party, sort of pandered to that.\"</p> <h2>Tar sands</h2> <p>Almost 4,000km away from Montreal, the vast plains of northern Alberta province lie at the heart of another national debate. The region contains 140,000 sq km of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil-sands\" title=\"\">tar sands</a>\" \u2013 a mixture of sand, water and clay the texture of cold molasses \u2013 which contain copious amounts of highly viscous petroleum. Over the past decade, technological developments and soaring oil prices have made its extraction economically viable, making it a prime destination for major international oil companies.</p> <p>Critics say that Harper's environmental policy favours these companies over the long-term wellbeing of Canada's natural environment. Last month, Ottawa cancelled almost <a href=\"http://www.ottawacitizen.com/technology/Federal+government+cancels+environmental+reviews+pipelines/7136029/story.html\" title=\"\">3,000 environmental reviews</a> on proposed development projects across the country, many of which involved tar sands oil extraction.</p> <p>The Canadian government has approved a 730-mile pipeline from the Alberta tar sands to the shores of British Columbia, where it will be loaded on to oil tankers and shipped to Asian markets. Environmental groups have launched a united stand against the project, claiming that Enbridge \u2013 the Calgary-based company at its head \u2013 has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/enbridge-canada-tar-sands-alberta\" title=\"\">dishonest about the risk of potential oil spills</a>. In 2010, an Enbridge pipe burst in northern Michigan, leaving a <a href=\"http://www.fox17online.com/news/fox17-kalamazoo-river-enbridge-oil-spill-still-a-concern-to-residents-20120911,0,2076893.story\" title=\"\">still-visible oily sheen on the area's rivers</a>.</p> <p>\"Canada has always been a natural resource extraction country \u2013 it's logging, it's hydro-power, it's mining, it's oil and gas,\" said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, international director at the Natural Resources and Defence Council. \"But the tar sands is such a big resource, and it drew such major players, that it's really reshaped the way the government has dealt with environmental issues.\"</p> <h2>First Nations</h2> <p>Tar sands oil extraction has also underscored an already fraught relationship between the federal government and Canada's nearly 700,000 indigenous people, called First Nations. For decades, resource extraction on First Nations land and chronically underfunded schools have left many of these communities mired in poverty, alcoholism and disease.</p> <p>Gerald Amos, former chief of the Haisla Nation in coastal British Columbia, said that while his community used to survive by catching oolichan fish \u2013 a type of smelt \u2013 in the nearby Kitamaat river, this traditional way of life is long gone. Toxic dumping has destroyed the river, driving the fish to the brink of extinction. Amos fears that the Enbridge project will consume what's left of the wilderness near his home, where the pipeline will meet the coast.</p> <p>\"I think that the big issue for a lot of communities \u2013 one that really hasn't been grappled with yet \u2013 is the cumulative impact of what we call progress,\" he said. \"And that's something that I think communities are going to have to start grappling with very quickly.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Exhibition of the week \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/renaissance_to_goya.aspx\" title=\"Renaissance to Goya at the British Museum\">Renaissance to Goya: prints and drawings from Spain </a></h2> <p>Spain is one of the great artistic nations of Europe yet art here evolved in a unique and unusual way. It did not look in the 1400s as if Spanish art was going to soar. That century saw the expulsion of the Moors and with them the loss of the arts that created the mosques and palaces of <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Mosque_Cordoba.jpg\" title=\"the mosque at Cordoba\">medieval Andaluc\u00eda</a>. Could the new exclusively Catholic Spain rival the beauty of medieval Islam? It took an immigrant from Crete, the ethereal genius El Greco, to give 16th century Spain <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001017\" title=\"El Greco at the Met\">truly great paintings</a>. In fact, his religious intensity pointed the way to the personal visions that would soon make Spanish art sublime. In the 1600s, the art of Spain explodes into power, from the unrivalled realism of Vel\u00e1zquez (see below) to the poetic Catholicism of <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/francisco-de-zurbaran-saint-francis-in-meditation/27646\" title=\"Zurbarn at the National Gallery, London\">Zurbar\u00e1n</a>.

  "<p>The death toll from the fire that ripped through a Karachi garment factory <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/13/karachi-fire-pakistan-workplaces\" title=\"\">this week</a> currently stands at 289, making it the largest number of casualties in a single industrial incident in Pakistan's history. Later, a fire at an illegal shoe factory in Lahore killed 25, bringing the total of Pakistani deaths in industrial incidents that day to more than 300. As the country mourns the enormous loss of life, attention is turning to lax labour laws and the culture of corruption that allows the scant regulations that do exist to be flouted.</p> <p>The facts of the Karachi fire are nightmarish. After the Karachi blaze started, workers were said to be unable to escape because the doors were locked. It is thought that this was to prevent them from leaving their shifts early, though it has also been speculated that it was because of a recent break-in. Allegedly, there was no emergency exit, with other doors blocked by piles of finished clothes, workers had to smash iron bars on the windows to jump several storeys to escape the flames, and unsafe chemicals in the rickety building made the smoke even more toxic. While the cause of the fire has not been confirmed, it has been blamed on faulty wiring. The owner of the factory looks to have gone into hiding. Although Pakistan's constitution guarantees the right to secure and humane working conditions, these twin tragedies have shown this right is meaningless. Ministers have been queuing up to offer their condolences and condemnation, with President Asif Ali Zardari announcing an investigation, and murder charges being filed against the factory owners for their \"utter negligence\".</p> <p>But what exactly is the legal protection for workers in Pakistan? The only legislation on health and safety that exists is the Hazardous Occupation Rule 1963, under the 1934 Factories Act. The act also has a whole section, added in 1997, that is concerned with fire safety. Pakistan is a signatory to the International Labour Organisation's labour inspection convention, which commits the government to ensuring that workers are fully informed about their legal rights, and to enabling inspectors to report on problems that aren't covered by existing regulations.</p> <p>So laws defending workers' rights do exist. But they are rendered redundant by a total failure of implementation. In fact, an executive order issued under the <a href=\"http://www.pbindustries.gov.in/downloads/INDUSTRIAL%20POLICY.pdf\" title=\"\">Punjab Industrial Policy 2003</a> actually abolished labour inspections, with the aim of \"developing an industry and business-friendly environment\" to attract fresh investment. The ban originated in Punjab (the province that is home to Lahore), and Sindh (where Karachi is situated), appears to have followed suit. Unsurpisingly, it was implemented under pressure from wealthy industrialists.</p> <p>Pakistan is a country with an enormous gulf between rich and poor, and an undue amount of influence wielded by a small number of industrial families. The country functions on a deeply entrenched web of patronage and vested interests, meaning that there is little interest in workers' rights and little motivation to change the status quo. Corruption exists at every level, from bribing local officials to overlook an illegal building, to influencing government policy. The civilian regime is weak, and according to labour activists, regulation has deteriorated even further in the past few years along with a general decline in governance.</p> <p>Textiles are big business in Pakistan, a major export that employs 38% of the manufacturing work force and accounted for 7.4% of GDP in 2011. Pakistani cotton is in high demand in neighbouring India, and underpins Pakistan's growing high-end fashion industry. But garment manufacturers claim that in order to compete with cheap products from Vietnam and India, they are forced to cut corners.</p> <p>Putting profits over worker safety is a universal problem, and can be seen in sweatshops throughout the developing world, including in neighbouring India and Bangladesh. But the scale of this tragedy has shone a light on the lax oversight and flagrant disregard for human life that runs riot in Pakistan.</p> <p>Authorities overlooking factory standards, building control, and fire safety have failed at every level. Will this disaster lead to lasting change and an end to the culture of impunity for wealthy businessmen? We must hope that the outraged declarations of politicians are not just empty words to be forgotten once compensation has been paid and the media storm dies down.</p>",
  "<p>When Cath injected herself with heroin, unaware it had been contaminated by anthrax, her wrist immediately began to swell and turn red. The pain was shocking. But she felt only anger and irritation.</p> <p>\"I wanted my usual buzz,\" she said. \"I'd been a heroin addict for 23 years. I knew I'd spiked my vein properly. I couldn't understand why the gear wasn't working.\"</p> <p>So she injected herself a second time. This time her entire arm swelled up. The red turned to purple. It spread up towards her elbow and down towards her fingers. The pain intensified but the drug high still didn't come.</p> <p>It was 2010 and Cath had infected herself with anthrax at the height of the largest single common-source outbreak of human anthrax in Britain in more than 50 years. The deaths spread across Europe: 126 cases were eventually identified, including 119 in the UK. At least 14 people died.</p> <p>This week health experts said a second drug user had died of anthrax in Blackpool, weeks after the first such death in the town.</p> <p>During the 2010 outbreak, everyone in Cath's community knew of the risks. Her needle-exchange clinic had posters warning that heroin contaminated with anthrax could kill and listing the symptoms. News of deaths and amputations caused by the disease spread across the drug users' grapevine. But Cath couldn't care less. \"My eyes slid over those posters,\" she says. \"I didn't think of my body as something I needed to keep alive \u2013 it was a just a piece of skin with veins that I could put drugs into.\"</p> <p>That day, as she watched her arm turn from purple to black, she just felt annoyed that her elusive hit hadn't materialised. She injected herself a third time. Finally, the opiate kicked in.</p> <p>When she woke, hours later, sweat was pouring off her and the pain in her arm was excruciating. \"It still didn't occur to me that the heroin had been contaminated,\" she said. \"I just thought it was another abscess.\"</p> <p>Cath was so used to abscesses that she barely bothered going to hospital to have them treated, not caring that doctors had considered amputating her infected arms and feet on a number of occasions.</p> <p>After three days, however, she was unable to stand the pain any longer. Diagnosed with anthrax, she was immediately put on an intravenous, antibiotic drip \u2013 the only vein to be found was in her neck. She was told an amputation was the most likely option but that death was a possibility.</p> <p>\"I couldn't compute that I had anthrax,\" she said. \"It was the stuff of terrorism and war to me. But it didn't make me think I should stop taking heroin. All I was worried about was that if they amputated my right arm, I'd have to learn how to inject with my left.\"</p> <p>Cath was lucky. The antibiotics killed the infection and on the fourth day, she was given 28 pills to take every day for two weeks and sent home. The first thing she did was to call her dealer.</p> <p>Last week, for the first time since the 2010 outbreak, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction admitted Europe was again in the grip of an anthrax outbreak, probably linked to contaminated heroin.</p> <p>There have been 10 cases identified across Europe since early June. The official advice from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is that more cases are to be expected.</p> <p>\"It's likely that further cases among people who inject heroin will be identified as part of the ongoing outbreak in EU countries,\" said Dr Fortune Ncube, an expert in blood-borne viruses with the HPA. \"The Department of Health has alerted the NHS of the possibility of people who inject drugs presenting to emergency departments and walk-in clinics with symptoms suggestive of anthrax.\"</p> <p>How the anthrax found its way into the heroin this time has puzzled police and health experts. In 2010, the contamination in the UK was eventually traced to a single batch infected with anthrax spores from an infected goat or contaminated hide somewhere in transit between Afghanistan or Pakistan and Scotland, probably in Turkey.</p> <p>There are other causes. Heroin can be naturally contaminated after harvesting from soil where an animal had died from anthrax. It can also can be contaminated if infected bone meal is used during the cutting process.</p> <p>Whatever the source, experts are highly critical of the advice that has been given to users in the past fortnight.</p> <p>Often, when there is a health scare among drug users, the advice government hands down through treatment agencies is to use drugs in safer ways. With HIV, for example, users were encouraged to use needle exchanges. This time, however, the advice is simple: stop using heroin and seek help from local treatment centres, which can provide support including substitute medication.</p> <p>That, according to some experts, is impracticable. They say that in an environment where it can take users six months to get access to heroin substitutes such as methadone or Subutex, asking users to stop using is futile.</p> <p>The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse disputes this timescale. It says the average waiting time to get treatment in England is five days \u2013 the lowest it has ever been \u2013 and even quicker in an emergency.</p> <p>\"The HPA campaign assumes users know what they're doing,\" said Mark Styles, a director for the DetoxPlus and Pierpoint addiction treatment centres in St Annes-on-Sea, near Blackpool. \"That's one hell of a presumption.\"</p> <p>Styles has come across half a dozen cases of anthrax in his 16 years of working with heroin users. \"They're not remotely interested in the risk of contracting anthrax,\" he said. \"To tell someone with a drug addiction that they need to stop taking the drug, is like telling me I can't drink water.\"</p> <p>Scott March agrees. An addict for 16 years, he eventually detoxed last year. March knows of at least four people who have died from anthrax linked to contaminated heroin. \"It was scary to be using drugs, knowing it could have anthrax in, but the urge to use is so powerful, that there's no fear strong enough to stop you,\" he said. \"Even if you knew your needle was full of contaminated heroin, the fear wouldn't be strong enough. You can't see past the denial.\"</p> <p>In the unlikely event that users were engaged enough to care about infection, added Styles, they would probably not spot its onset. \"The symptoms of anthrax are minor compared to the horrendous physical effects of taking heroin. Users are suffering so much anyway that they're simply not going to notice any difference,\" he said.</p> <p>Cath was aware she could infect herself with anthrax a second time after leaving hospital. \"The contaminated drugs were still going around,\" she said. \"But my urge to use again was stronger than my will to live.\"</p> <p>Nine months after her anthrax infection, however, she decided to detox. \"I didn't give up immediately after having anthrax but it did make something click very subtly inside me,\" she said.</p> <p>Cath has now been clean for two years, including more than a year of treatment. She has trained as an aromatherapist and masseuse. \"If I can give up, then anyone can \u2013 with determination and good treatment,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I had anthrax, been an addict for 23 years and had got to the point where I was effectively not human: I was rotting, I lived like a rabid, stray dog. But now I love life now and my family are proud of me. When she looks at me, my mum doesn't have anguish in her eyes any more.\"</p>",
  "<p>With the Leveson inquiry in mind, let me explore the implications of the Duchess of Cambridge pictures episode (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/14/kate-middleton-topless-pictures-palace-lawyers\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/sep/14/duchess-of-cambridge-magazines\">here</a>).</p> <p>France has a strict privacy law that is supposed to protect people from the unwanted attentions of the paparazzi. But it appears to make little difference to the country's intrusive celebrity magazines because they accept they will be fined. </p> <p>The fines are relatively small \u2013 usually less than \u20ac30,000 \u2013 so publishers view the problem of whether or not to publish in commercial terms. </p> <p>They make a cynical calculation based on the improved revenue through extra sales set against the amount they will be fined for breaking the law.</p> <p>So let's suppose that some kind of privacy legislation were to be introduced in Britain. Surely publishers and editors would do as the French do.</p> <p>Of course, fines could be higher than in France - and perhaps higher still for repeated offences - but there would have to be a sensible upper limit.</p> <p>Anyway, a new privacy law isn't going to be enacted here. So, in practical terms, privacy intrusions within Britain will be dealt with, as now, through a system of press regulation or, in the courts, through actions based on article 8 of the European convention of human rights.</p> <p>So let's imagine that Leveson recommends a form of regulation that allows for newspapers and magazines to be fined for breaches of a code of ethics (this is likely given the industry's acceptance of enhanced penalties).</p> <p>As with a privacy law, a similar outcome is quite possible. Editors may well risk fines in order to benefit from additional sales. They would also, as now, try to argue public interest justifications.</p> <p>One new form of public interest defence has become crucial (as The Sun showed when publishing the Prince Harry photo). If pictures are published on websites across the world, and can therefore be deemed to be \"in the public domain\", then why not allow them to be carried on British news websites?</p> <p>As Lord Justice Leveson recognises, it is impossible to regulate what happens outside Britain's jurisdiction. Print imported into Britain can be constrained; online material cannot.</p> <p>So let's take another flight of fancy by asking what might happen should the topless Kate pictures go viral, and therefore global. Say they reached similar levels of online publication to the Harry pictures, would Rupert Murdoch allow The Sun to publish by arguing - <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/press/angry-murdoch-used-harry-photos-to-defy-leveson-8081427.html\">as he did with the Prince Harry picture</a> - that it's all a matter of press freedom?</p> <p>I doubt that he would contemplate publishing these particular pictures, not least because of a possible negative public reaction at a time when the paper is on the back foot over its Hillsborough coverage.</p> <p>Then again, note that the Palace huffed and puffed about The Sun's use of the Prince Harry picture, and then sat on its hands. It did not make a formal complaint to the Press Complaints Commission, implying that it acknowledged the strength of the paper's argument.</p> <p>Deciding where to draw lines in such matters remains problematic.</p>",

  "<p>Exporting overseas can be a key opportunity for small firms to win new business. After all, as Richard Jeffery from Business Growth Hub pointed out in his recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/jun/12/exporting-your-product\">blog post</a>, why limit yourself to domestic trade when the UK makes up just 1% of the world's population?</p> <p>Here at the Guardian Small Business Network we have seen some really inspiring examples of small businesses who've successfully gained a foothold in the global marketplace. SMEs have exported the best of British around the world:<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/jun/22/networking-locally-power-business-globally\"> top-quality food from an idyllic Lake District</a> base, timepieces from a Derby clockmaker, and ice cream from Somerset.</p> <p>Keen to follow in their footsteps?

Was it conceived in the smoke-filled back rooms of London pubs or did it leap fully formed from the dive bars of New York?</p> <p>Few would imagine the genre that revolutionised music was actually born at a cinema matinee in the Peruvian capital of Lima.</p> <p>Almost a decade before the Ramones, the New York Dolls or the Sex Pistols struck a chord in anger, the Peruvian band Los Saicos (the Psychos) were screaming, speeding and drinking their way to local notoriety. Now, thanks to an upsurge of interest and a recent documentary, the band \u2013 all in their sixties \u2013 have reformed and found their biggest following in half a century.</p> <p>Their signature tune, Demolici\u00f3n (Demolition) has been revived as an anthem for political protesters and, reportedly, - for drug barons. In the Lima district of Lince, a marble plaque has been erected with the provocative claim etched in marble: \"The global punk movement was born here. Demolish!!!\"</p> <p>Los Saicos burned brightly and briefly in the mid-60s, performing together for a few years and recording no more than a dozen songs. They were inspired by Elvis and the Beatles to play rock'n'roll but thanks to a frenetic effort to make up for a lack of training and equipment (Roland Carpio made his own guitar), with energy and attitude they ended up with a sound that was 10 years ahead of its time.</p> <p>Demolici\u00f3n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVaaDLwWvI\" title=\"\">starts slowly with a typical 60s guitar and drum intro</a>, then jolts a decade into the future as lead man, Erwin Flores, screeches \"tatatatayayayaya\", followed by an anarchic exhortation to \"Smash down the train station!\"</p> <p>Their claim to a place in history was bolstered in December when they were listed as the world's first punk band in the Spanish Dictionary of Punk and Hardcore published by Zona de Obras.</p> <p>\"They are the first to play what later became punk. There was no name for that at the time, but the riffs are definitely punk,\" said Jos\u00e9 Beramendi, the producer of <a href=\"http://www.saicomania.com/\" title=\"\">Saicomania</a>, a documentary about the band. \"You expect this sound from North America or Europe, but it's not something you expect to hear in the 1960s in Latin America.\"</p> <p>It is a controversial claim. There were no safety pins, no mohicans and, according to the band, no drugs beyond cigarettes and alcohol. But they were undoubtedly breaking the mould.</p> <p>Los Saicos were raised on a musical diet of Harry Belafonte, Peruvian <em>criolla</em> and classical waltzes in the conservative and hierarchical society characterised in the early novels of Mario Vargas Llosa. Elvis and the Beatles changed their lives.</p> <p>Their early shows were at cinema matinees, where bands were hired as an extra draw for the screenings. Most groups performed covers of syrupy pop songs, but Los Saicos revved up the energy by mixing original love ballads with hoarse, souped-up tracks about prison breaks, funerals and destruction.</p> <p>\"Compared to other bands of the time, we had a bad-boy image. They turned up with their aunts, we had girls on each arm,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/14/los-saicos-peru-1960s-punk-video\" title=\"\">recalls the drummer Pancho Guevara</a>.</p> <p>They were detained several times by the police, mostly for speeding but also for taking a sledgehammer, axe and fake TNT to the railway station for a record cover photo shoot.</p> <p>After a few frenetic years of celebrity, which saw them host a daily TV show, the band moved on. Flores relocated to the US and became a Nasa scientist. C\u00e9sar \"Papi\" Castrill\u00f3n switched from bass to retail sales, Carpio died and Guevara started a construction company.</p> <p>But their music slowly built up a cult following and is now moving into the mainstream. The band reformed in 2010 after a 45-year gap, their records were re-released in Spain and they performed overseas for the first time \u2013 in Spain, Mexico and Argentina. They are in talks to play in the US next year.</p> <p>Demolici\u00f3n has become a rebel anthem \u2013 and not just for the politically disaffected. \"I heard a report from Mexico that the bosses of drug cartels drive into town in trucks with speakers playing it at full volume. That's cool,\" said Guevara, though he insisted the band were more naive than anarchic.</p> <p>Perhaps because he is now a pillar of the Lima business community, Guevara claims the song was originally a joke about trainspotting. \"Leftwing groups use it as a protest song, but we were never interested in politics. There was just nothing much to do in those days so I used to go to the station and watch the trains coming and going. I talked about it endlessly, which really irritated Erwin. That's why he wrote Smash the Train Station. It was his way of telling me to shut up about the trains.\"</p> <p>It will take more than a plaque and a box-set to convince rock historians that Los Saicos were the first punks. In the early 60s, bands such as the Trashmen and the Sonics were thrashing out similarly furious tracks and Iggy Pop had formed his first group.</p> <p>But Guevara said the label was unimportant. \"I don't know what 'punk' is,\" he said. \"We wanted to play rock'n'_roll but this is the sound that came out.

In this video, he <a href=\"http://youtu.be/c8XzmWb16_w\" title=\"\">describes how he founded the day</a> and attempts to make Torbay a \"dementia friendly community\". He says on receiving his original diagnosis, having lost his father and grandmother to the disease:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I had two choices: I could have sat back and done nothing and just let the disease take over or I could have tried and done something about it.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>McNamara has also <a href=\"http://whoseshoes.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/in-the-shoes-of-norman-mcnamara-4-dementia-awareness-day-15-september-2012/\" title=\"\">contributed a guest post</a> to the excellent In the shoes of series, which has been running since May on the Whose shoes blog to share individuals' experiences of dementia. Gill Phillips, who writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have gathered over 60 high quality \"in my shoes\" guest blogs from a very wide range of perspectives \u2013 stories that tell us what is happening in dementia care across the UK. We have highlighted fantastic projects and breakthroughs, alongside disturbing examples of poor care, battles over funding and safeguarding concerns. We need to make a REAL difference to people living with dementia \u2013 not just in the future, but for people like Norman McNamara and the carers who have written so powerfully in our series.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Today's post is by the new care and support minister, Norman Lamb, who has an <a href=\"http://whoseshoes.wordpress.com/2012/09/14/in-the-shoes-of-norman-lamb-minister-of-state-for-care-and-support/\" title=\"\">update on the prime minister's challenge on dementia</a>. He writes:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are already signs of progress up and down the country. Hard work is beginning to bear fruit. We are seeing a steady increase in diagnosis rates and we have seen a significant fall in the prescribing of antipsychotics for people with dementia. It will take time to achieve all our aims but we remain committed to dementia and by working with health, social care and wider society we will succeed.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Speaking of <strong>Norman Lamb</strong>, Roy Lilley's <a href=\"http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Dr-Deaf.html?soid=1102665899193&amp;aid=n7b5phlO9RA\" title=\"\">must-read morning email</a> for NHS managers shares this interesting archive story. <strong> </strong>Lamb told the Lib Dem conference in 2007, when he was the party's health spokesman, that patients needing emergency NHS treatment after becoming drunk or incapacitated by drugs <a href=\"http://www.libdemvoice.org/lamb-%E2%80%9Crat-arsed-drunks%E2%80%9D-should-pay-ae-bills-1322.html\" title=\"\">should be charged</a>, or as he put it:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If you get rat-arsed on a Friday night and get taken to A&amp;E where you are foul and abusive to staff, is it right for the taxpayers to fund your life-saving treatment?</p> </blockquote> <p><br>As the Lib Dem Voice site put it at the time, Lamb couldn't be accused of slipping out his policy gently. Lamb's policy proposals at the time also included an elected local health board to give people a bigger say in services a local health contribution to allow communities to raise extra money for local health services.</p> <p>\u2022 More on the BBC's <strong>Trouble on the Estate</strong> programme. The <a href=\"http://unemployednet.org/\" title=\"\">UnemployedNet</a> site, which describes itself as the first free one-stop online support site for unemployed people, says the Panorama programme, and series like Saints and Scroungers suggest \"the BBC just doesn't seem to have the skills to make documentaries about working class life in Britain\". The site's review of Trouble on the Estate says:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The sensationalist tone was present throughout; a more balanced documentary may gather fewer viewers, but it would be fairer and more truthful without the dramatic music, repeated shots of the one boarded-up building suggesting deprivation that wasn't shown, and lack of factual and statistical context for much of the information provided by those appearing on camera.<br>In presenting the idea that we were seeing all life on the estate it erred towards dishonesty; life everywhere includes positives and calm time when little happens. The closest we came to a functional relationship was a 15 year old who had moved to his Aunt's house a mile away; we saw him with his girlfriend on the swings in full romantic effect. For every workless family we saw, statistics suggest there must be at least two with work, people who are getting up every day and providing, even on the Shadsworth [the estate in the programme].</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 This picture story by photojournalist James Clasper, who describes the \"mouldering mosaic of paper\" on display as <a href=\"http://jamesclasper.com/bread-line\" title=\"\">a London shopkeeper keeps record of the amounts owed by his customers on the breadline</a>.

  "<p>A City trader recklessly gambled with illicit trades to boost his bonus, and ran up potential losses of more than \u00a37bn at one point, a sum big enough to sink his employer, the global bank UBS, a court has heard.</p> <p>Kweku Adoboli, a trusted and experienced member of UBS's exchange traded fund (ETF) desk in London, risked ever-greater sums in an attempt to conceal his losses over two and a half years before he was caught in September 2011, Southwark crown court was told.</p> <p>Sasha Wass QC, prosecuting, said the 32-year-old took his bank's money and \"fraudulently gambled it away\" in an attempt to boost his status and become one of the elite circle of City traders who earn vast annual sums.</p> <p>She said: \"Mr Adoboli's motive was to increase his bonus, his status, his job prospects and his ego. Like most gamblers he believed he had the magic touch. Like most gamblers, when he lost, he caused chaos and disaster to himself and all of those around him.\"</p> <p>The total losses to UBS were eventually calculated at $2.3bn, or just over \u00a31.4bn. Wass told the jury: \"This colossal loss rose purely as a result of Mr Adoboli's fraudulent deal making, which amounted to naked gambling.\"</p> <p>However, she added, at one point the scale of Adoboli's liabilities to the bank through vast trades, which were not properly hedged to mitigate the risk, reached almost $12bn.</p> <p>\"Make no mistake, the scale of Mr Adoboli's gambling was so large and unchecked he could quite easily have approached and even exceeded the limits of the bank's resources,\" she said.</p> <p>By \"risking the very existence of the bank\" through the scale of his activities, and in the deliberate and calculated way he carried out the scam, Wass said, Adoboli amounted to something quite different to the usual rogue trader.</p> <p>The court was told that the former public schoolboy joined UBS as a graduate trainee in 2003 after completing his degree at Nottingham University. He initially worked in the back office, which maintains records, analyses trades and makes sure accounts are balanced and correct, Wass said.</p> <p>\"He became intimately aware of how the bank's accounting controls worked and would have seen their strengths and weaknesses. He would have known what events triggered the alarms and how to avoid this happening,\" she told the jury.</p> <p>Two years later he moved to the trading floor and in a rapid ascent became a director on the ETF desk. His salary rose to match: beginning at \u00a333,000 with a bonus of \u00a37,500, by 2008 Adoboli was earning a combined sum of \u00a365,000. Just two years later this was \u00a3360,000 \u2013 a basic salary of \u00a3110,000 and a bonus of \u00a3250,000 based partly on the bank's wider performance but also on how much profit an employee brings in.</p> <p>This gave a false picture of his skills, Wass said: \"Mr Adobli's income had risen exponentially during 2009 and 2010 not because he was a genuine top trader but because, as he later admitted, it was during this period that he began to fraudulently gamble the bank's money.\"</p> <p>Adoboli racked up the giant losses undetected through three means, Wass said. First, he often exceeded the official daily trading limit per employee of $100m. He also failed to hedge trades by making balancing trades to mitigate potential losses, an insurance method that also caps potential profits. By doing so Adoboli hoped to maximise profits and thus his bonus, she said. Finally, he falsified data so as not to record his trades properly, often inventing false clients and trades for hedges.</p> <p>Adoboli's reckless manner was like that of a \"martingale\" gambler, a reckless system of betting in which a loss on a position is followed up by a double-sized punt on the same outcome, on the assumption it will eventually recoup losses.</p> <p>Wass said: \"He was certain his prediction of the way the market was moving was correct and when the market moved the opposite way and his bets lost, he simply increased his bets.\"</p> <p>In the summer of last year, Wass told the jury, colleagues started to ask questions about his trading account, particularly one accountant in the UBS back office. \"Each time that Mr Adoboli was questioned he gave a plausible explanation for his trades,\" she said. \"Mr Adoboli was able to draw on his experience of working within the control system to sidestep the questions.\"</p> <p>But on 14 September, under intense scrutiny and aware a number of trades were \"about to hit the buffers\", Adoboli panicked and walked out of the UBS office, saying he had to see a doctor. Using his home email account he sent his bosses a message which, Wass argued, admitted his guilt.</p> <p>In the email, read to the court, Adoboli said he had tried to suppress losses from \"off book\" trades, a number of which were, he warned, still \"live\". It continued: \"I have now left the office for the sake of discretion. I will need to come back in to discuss the positions and explain face to face but for reasons that are obvious I did not think it was wise to stay on the desk this afternoon.\"</p> <p>Saying he took full responsibility for what happened, he ended: \"I am deeply sorry to have left this mess for everyone and to have put my bank and my colleagues at risk.\"</p> <p>Wass told the jury: \"You will see, Mr Adoboli's dishonest practices had a measure of success in the early days. He was cheating the system and he appeared to be getting away with it for years.</p> <p>\"On 14 September last year his system crashed like a car hitting a wall at high speed. Due to a series of events that had been building up over the previous few weeks, Mr Adoboli's pyramid of fraud collapsed. He was left with no choice but to admit exactly what he had been up to.\"</p> <p>Adoboli, from Whitechapel, east London, denies four counts of fraud and false accounting between October 2008 and September 2011.</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>One question a lot of British gamers had after the Wii U announcements on Thursday was: well, how much is the console going to cost?</p> <p>Although Nintendo provided retail prices for Japan and the US, the company's European head, Satoru Shibata, explained during his press conference that in his region retailers would be setting their own pricing for the basic White bundle and the premium Black edition.</p> <p>This, of course, goes back to 2002, when Nintendo was fined over \u00a390m by the European Commission for colluding with suppliers to rig the prices of its consoles and games across the continent. Nintendo fought the allegations and managed to have the fine reduced several years later, but since then the firm has erred on the side of caution, allowing retailers to set their own pricing structures based on the trade cost.</p> <p>\"The trade cost prices of Wii U are at just over \u00a3200 for the basic unit, \u00a3245 for the premium unit and \u00a3270 for the ZombiU set,\" says Christopher Dring of industry news site, MCV.</p> <p>And what we're seeing today is a range of prices, hovering at between \u00a3249.99 and \u00a3259.99 for the basic edition (which comes with the console, one GamePad and AC adaptors) and between \u00a3289.99 and \u00a3309.99 for the premium Black edition (console, GamePad, copy of NintendoLand, sensor bar, HDMI cable, Nintendo Premium membership).</p> <p>There is also a ZombiU edition of the Black console, which comes with all the premium kit together with a copy of Ubisoft's zombie game \u2013 that's coming in at between \u00a3329.99 and \u00a3349.99.</p> <p>Right now, Amazon is at the lower end, with White at \u00a3249, Black at \u00a3299 and the ZombiU Black bundle at \u00a3329 \u2013 other online retailers will hover at the same price point. HMV is pretty competitive for a high-street chain, with \u00a3249.99 for White basic, \u00a3299.99 for Black and \u00a3329.99 for the ZombiU pack. Game is at the upper end on \u00a3259.99 for the basic pack, \u00a3309.99 for the premium and \u00a3349.99 for the ZombiU bundle.</p> <p>The big question is whether the big supermarkets will start trying to undercut each other on price. Chains such as Tesco and Asda will often sell big games like Call of Duty at cost or even at a loss to encourage shoppers into their stores, tying the prices in with minimum grocery spends. Will they follow a similar tactic on hardware?</p> <p>\"It will largely depend on the stock level,\" says Dring. \"3DS prices were cut quite severely when it launched, but there were quite a number of consoles in the channel so the big supermarkets and online retailers \u2013 Amazon, Tesco, Asda, etc \u2013 felt capable of going low on the price. Whether Wii U gets similar cuts will largely depend on how many consoles Nintendo will make available. Personally, I'd be surprised if there will be severe discounting pre-Christmas. Although perhaps \u00a310 here or there.\"</p> <p>Potential buyers should also look out for special retailer bundles. Independent stores and smaller chains unable to compete on price will often create their own packs, complete with additional games, controllers or leads. It's worth keeping an eye on your nearest indie stores, or checking the local press.</p> <p>And now we know the price point, how is the console likely to fair? \"I expect the Wii U to conduct brisk business over Christmas and into the new year due to pent-up demand from the original Wii evangelists,\" says Piers Harding-Rolls, senior principle analyst with IHS Screen Digest. \"However, this is a significant premium on the original Wii, so more casual buyers that come to the product after the launch phase will need to be impressed with tons of value in content and services to take the plunge.\"</p> <p>IHS Screen Digest has estimated that global sales will be around 2.5m by the end of the year. As for the stores themselves: \"I think retailer expectation for the Wii U will be realistic considering the general economic backdrop and competition from other consumer devices, such as new iPods, tablets, smartphones and handheld games consoles. But there will also be an awareness that the product is likely to sell well to early adopters over the Christmas sales season, so this Wii U launch period is an opportunity to push through some significant business if executed correctly.\"</p> <p>Retailers certainly need a hit. Sales at Game have been falling this year as consumers begin to tire of the current generation consoles, which have been around for over six years. A new console release can energise the whole market. Game and HMV will be thinking of ways to get interested customers into stores, such as fitting demo units and holding special events.</p> <p>It's likely that demand will outstrip initial supply, however, so pre-ordering may be a good idea. If a Wii U crops up on your child's (or partner's) Christmas list this year, it's probably better not to wait until 24 December before legging it around every game store and supermarket in the area.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/13/gas-government-row-energy\">Thursday's spat between the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc)</a> is the latest and most high-profile manifestation of the debate currently dominating UK energy and climate policy: the role of natural gas.</p> <p>Everyone agrees that switching from dirty coal to lower-carbon gas for power generation may help to reduce emissions quickly and inexpensively in the short term while genuinely low-carbon energy sources such as renewables and nuclear are scaling up. The question is how substantial this 'transitional' role should be and how long it can be usefully served given the UK's ambitious and legally binding carbon budgets.</p> <p>The CCC, which exists to provide the government with independent advice on climate and energy policy, believes the most reliable and inexpensive way to stay within the carbon budgets will be to aim for a largely decarbonised power sector by 2030, with the average unit of electricity producing no more than 50g of CO2. In this scenario gas would need to shrink to an extremely small proportion of total electricity generation.

This perspective has been bubbling up for a while and appeared to have definitely shifted policy in July <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/wms_ro_lm/wms_ro_lm.aspx\">when Decc issued a statement saying</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Government will set out its gas strategy in the Autumn, and is today confirming that it sees gas continuing to play an important part in the energy mix well into and beyond 2030, while meeting our carbon budgets. Through the 2020s, and beyond if gas proves cheap, we expect it to continue to play a key role ensuring that we have sufficient capacity both to meet everyday demand and complementing an increasing amount of relatively intermittent and inflexible generation. We do not expect the role of gas to be restricted to providing back up to renewables, and in the longer term we see an important role for gas with CCS.</p> </blockquote> <p>This statement \u2013 combined with the government's reluctance so far to impose a tough emissions standard for the power grid in 2030 \u2013 suggests that the government foresees more unabated gas generation in twenty years' time than shown in the chart above. This is of great concern to the CCC, which <a href=\"http://hmccc.s3.amazonaws.com/EMR%20letter%20-%20September%2012.pdf\">sent its letter this week</a> on the basis that such a situation \"would be incompatible with meeting legislated carbon budgets\".</p> <p>What's odd in the whole discussion is that it's not exactly clear what the government is actually proposing \u2013 nor what if anything has changed. In his response to the CCC yesterday, Decc secretary of state Ed Davey said that: \"After 2030 we expect that gas will increasingly be used only as back up, or fitted with CCS technology\". This seems to clash with the statement from July, at least in sentiment, even if the word \"increasingly\" is vague enough to fudge the matter.</p> <p>Moreover, Davey emphasised that the government remains \"absolutely committed to meeting our statutory carbon budgets.\" The implication here is that if there <em>is</em> to be a bigger role for gas in the coming decades over and above what the CCC predicts, there would need to be additional carbon savings made in other sectors \u2013 but which sectors and how?</p> <p>I spoke to some people in Decc to try and clarify the situation. The view inside the department appears to be that, despite the July statement, nothing has in fact changed and there's no plan for unabated gas to have a significant role in the 2030s. There could perhaps be a small amount more than the CCC recommends but not more than already stated in the 2011 <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/assets/decc/11/tackling-climate-change/carbon-plan/3702-the-carbon-plan-delivering-our-low-carbon-future.pdf\">Carbon Plan</a>, which said specifically that \"from 2030 onwards, a major role for gas as a baseload source of electricity is only realistic with large numbers of gas CCS plants.\"</p> <p>So what's going on here? It's hard to say. One possibility is that Decc officials haven't yet come to terms with the fact that their best-laid plans are going to be railroaded by the gas-loving Treasury. Another is that Decc has skilfully trodden a line between keeping the Treasury satisfied on the one hand while protecting the carbon budgets on the other. </p> <p>My own hunch, however, is that the recent statements on gas have been driven less by the Treasury and more \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 by a fear about keeping the lights on in the next five years. In a recent briefing, a senior figure in UK energy world told me that on current trends, spare capacity in the UK grid would get worrying low in a few years' time. The only way to be sure of reliable power supply in the short term, he said, would be to build more gas plants but this wasn't happening due to the uncertain investment climate \u2013 including for example lack of clarity on 'capacity payments' paid to owners of gas power plants that end up serving mainly as backup for renewables.</p> <p>I can't say if this view is correct but it does seem to fit with the line that Decc is currently trying to walk between keenly courting the gas industry on the one hand and empathetically stating its commitment to the carbon budgets on the other.</p> <p>We'll have a better idea in a couple of months when Decc's gas strategy is published.</p>",

The school was a large, fairly old and traditional building, but the headmaster was very enthusiastic and I got a sense that the kids and teachers got on well. This was a proper lesson. It was geometry and it was way over my head. I visited a\u00a0few state schools in this district of St Louis, and the only one that had more than a handful of any white students at all was the Gifted and Talented school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Germain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395983368\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347365061039/School-Bornago-College-Ne-014.jpg\" alt=\"World Classrooms: School Bornago College, Netherlands\" width=\"611\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>School</strong> Bornago College, Netherlands<br/> <strong>Fertility rate</strong> 1.8<br/> <strong>Life expectancy at birth</strong> 81<br/> <strong>Population on less than $2 a day</strong> 0%<br/> <strong>Primary age children not in school</strong> 1%<br/> <strong>Youth literacy</strong> 99.7%<br/><br/> These kids were having a sports day.

The heat in the water must be released into the atmosphere if the ice is to re-form this autumn. \"This is like a new energy source for the atmosphere,\" said Francis.</p> <p>This heat and water vapour will affect the all-important jet stream \u2013 the west-to-east winds that are the boundary between cold Arctic and the warm mid-latitudes. Others researchers have already shown that the jet stream has been shifting northwards in recent years. Francis and colleagues have recently documented that the jet stream is also slowing down.</p> <p>\"The jet stream is clearly weaker,\" said Francis. That means weather systems, be it rain or dry conditions, are slow to move on and last longer. Ultimately this can result in \"blocking\" events, such as the conditions that produced the terrible heatwave in western Russia during the summer of 2010, she said.</p> <p>This summer, Greenland experienced a similar blocking anti-cyclone, resulting in a record surface melting of its ice sheet. It is not possible to directly connect that block to the prolonged US heatwave and drought this summer, Francis said. However \"blocks act like a traffic jam, slowing down weather patterns elsewhere\".</p> <p>These changes are happening much earlier than scientists thought, said James Overland, an oceanographer and researcher at the University of Washington.</p> <p>\"We've only had a little bit of global warming so far,\" Overland said.</p> <p>As the sea ice continues to decline, the jet stream will likely continue to slow more, and shift further north \"bringing wild temperature swings and greater numbers of extreme events\" in the future he said. \"We're in uncharted territory.\"</p>",
  "<p>I spent yesterday at a conference in Cambridge on the theme of \"<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">reputation in the age of protest</a>\", sponsored by the YouGov polling organisation and addressed by speakers as diverse as British and US government officials, corporate CEOs and Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian blogger who was nominated for the Nobel peace prize for his role in the Arab spring.</p> <p>In a world where, so several people reminded the audience, reputations acquired over 20 years can be lost on Twitter in a careless five minutes, the session was a mixture of optimism and occasional alarm bells. How could it be otherwise on a day when the Hillsborough coverup was finally exposed (a Leveson scandal before Leveson!) and when a tawdry and provocative Islam-bashing US film had provoked an ugly and deadly response, equally foolish, in the Middle East?</p> <p>On a lighter depressing note, we woke this morning \u2013 the conference, co-sponsored by the Guardian, continues today \u2013 to find that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/14/kate-william-furious-topless-photographs\" title=\"\">snatch-photos of a topless Duchess of Cambridge are being published in a French magazine</a>. Odd in a country whose ferocious privacy laws protected the likes of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but serving no evident public interest. Alas, as with Prince Harry's willie, we will hear more spurious claims about the public right to leer from slow learners in Fleet Street.</p> <p>In Cambridge yesterday all sorts of people said that governments and corporations can't control the new social media (or can they? warned others) and had better get with the programme, responding as rapidly to individual consumer complaints aired online as BP did to the Deepwater oil rig disaster, only more adroitly.</p> <p>Likewise diplomats, who need to adapt to ever-faster news cycles in different time zones \u2013 which also means embracing Twitter and Facebook. But the likes of Ghonim also wondered if the flipside of a binary online world (good/bad with few nuances), where brutal online ridicule and loathing is widespread, might have quashed the noble aspirations of an Abraham Lincoln or a Martin Luther King at an early stage.</p> <p>Fascinating stuff, but all tough stuff too, underpinned by the way globalisation is reinforced by internet technology at a time when the west's leadership in that globalising wave is being challenged by a resurgent Asia. But \"Globalisation 2.0\" also sees what Joel Rogers, director of YouGov Cambridge, calls \"transnational forces of public opinion\", which make it all much harder to manage in traditional ways.</p> <p>In other words, individuals are more empowered by the internet, and a new global middle class can make its influence felt against tyrannical or merely incompetent government \u2013 most visibly across the Middle East since 2011 \u2013 as can society's discontented, those who have lost their jobs and prosperity thanks to globalisation's shifts of production or who can see on TV and their smartphones what others have and want it too. In the wake of global financial meltdown extremes of right and left return to challenge the politics of centrism.</p> <p>Parts of yesterday's exchanges were of a familiar kind, almost pre-internet. Thus General Lord (Richard) Dannatt, former chief of the general staff, spoke of Britain's lingering postcolonial obligations in many parts of the world, but also how the risks of military intervention had often been understated since the Falklands war of 1982 revived the fashion. Politicians, solders and diplomats focus too much on immediate problems instead of horizon-scanning to nip potential problems in the bud.</p> <p>The conference was backed by global polling which the Guardian has been reporting in the past few days: predictable mistrust of Mitt Romney in Europe, for example, and the divergent views on the state and social policy on the two sides of the Atlantic, but also lingering mistrust of Britain for its receding imperial role in the Middle East and north Africa to offset more positive attributes such as democracy and the rule of law. British education is a conspicuously successful feature of its \"soft power\" in 2012.</p> <p>Politicians get a predictable kicking in terms of public trust and reputation, though someone \u2013 a corporate, not a politician \u2013 pointed out that fewer than one in three MPs were compromised by the MPs' expenses scandal and that this had not been sufficiently pointed out. Quite so. Less predictably, Gary Hoffman, the Barclays banker who stepped in to sort out tottering Northern Rock in 2008 \u2013 he was going off Barclays at the time \u2013 said he did so because he was impressed by customer loyalty.</p> <p>Even as they took their savings out in panic they said they wanted to put them back again when things settled down. Yes, you can change corporate culture and correct past error, including corrupt practices but \u2013 said someone else \u2013 you have to spend more time on low-probability/high-risk problems than the less important high-probability/low-risk kind that firms tend to focus on.</p> <p>And yes, you need to have established good relations with the government \u2013 or media \u2013 before a crisis breaks. It's too late when it's already under way. That was one of BP's problems in the Gulf of Mexico, compounded by CEO Tony Hayward's decision (his advisers told him to) to go on US TV in person \u2013 a Brit with an unfortunate accent and smirk \u2013 instead of putting up one of BP's tough Texan oilmen.</p> <p>It's all about adaptation to change in ever-faster circumstances. The British army thinks the US army is too \"kinetic\" \u2013 too hyperactive \u2013 and that its own experience in Northern Ireland would allow it to run Basra with ease. But the Americans adapted more quickly and created General David Petraeus's \"counter-insurgency army\" to defeat al-Qaida and force the Saddamist Sunni insurgents to negotiate with the Shia majority, said Sir Robert Fry, a clever former marine general. In Syria it is the Sunnis who are the repressed majority \u2013 a mirror-image situation which is encouraging renewed militancy in Iraq.</p> <p>I could write much more. Let's end on a negative note and a positive one. Fry said that the invasion of Iraq broke a 200-year British consensus about the utility of force: that the government of the day would only fight when it had to and that the military would eventually do the job honourably and well with public support.</p> <p>I thought that verdict overlooked all sorts of controversy and incompetence, from the Crimean and Boer wars to the Kenyan and Malayan emergencies, but we can see that there will be fewer such interventions in future. Chinese strategic thinkers cannot believe how incompetent the US and its British allies have been in recent deployments, said Fry, unleashing forces they did not understand with awful consequences.</p> <p>The day's closing session was more optimistic. Ghonim, jailed in Cairo during the Egyptian revolution, spoke of the internet as a tool which made it harder for repressive regimes to deny inconvenient facts or sweep protest under the carpet (how can it when the photos are on Facebook?) and insisted that the wisdom of crowds \u2013 \"the masses always outsmart the politicians\" \u2013 can prevail.</p> <p>Would the Egyptian revolution have occurred without the internet? Yes, but differently and more slowly, Ghonim suggested. Are the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist forces a threat to the openness and reform which the Globalisation 2.0 world seeks? The Brotherhood is in power now, not simply criticising from the sidelines. That makes it more realistic and will make its supporters more realistic over time, he seemed to suggest.</p> <p>With all the dismay evident among Muslim speakers at the murder of Chris Stevens, the sympathetic US ambassador to Libya \u2013 the provocative film is so ridiculous that it amounts to a promotion for Islam, Ghonim explained \u2013 it was hard to pretend that the road ahead would be easy. After all, Egypt and Algeria almost came to blows after online abuse between supporters of their two sides before a World Cup qualifier.</p> <p>But Ghonim was warm and wise, a good speaker with whom to end the day.</p>",

Personally I see a buoyant, active manufacturing sector in which growth has to be managed in a sensible way, especially with threats of further economic turmoil in Europe.</p> <p><strong>Pick the right premises:</strong> Last year we consolidated from two smaller premises to one larger one. The lease on the larger premises was considerably cheaper than the two \u2013 mainly down to commercial property being much more available now than when we signed the lease on the smaller units and is therefore much cheaper. Because of this, now is a good time to expand.

We have always done well on word-of-mouth recommendations. </p> <p><strong>The industry needs more skilled staff: </strong>We have been very lucky recently as we have continued to grow and expand. Mainly due to our clients demanding more to meet their customers' needs. The biggest problem we have (and I'm sure other manufacturers do as well) is getting skilled staff. There is a lack of skill in the manufacturing industry and I don't see the government, or anyone else for that matter, giving it the push it needs. There is a lot of work in the UK and not enough people to do it.</p> <p><em>Jean-Louis Evans is the managing director of </em><a href=\"http://www.tuvps.co.uk/home_psuk\" title=\"\"><em>T\u00dcV S\u00dcD Product Service Ltd</em></a></p> <p><strong>New technologies will provide opportunities for manufacturers:</strong> 4G in telecoms will throw up opportunities.

  "<p>Financial markets have rallied since July on the hope that the global economic and geopolitical outlook will not worsen, or, if it does, that central banks stand ready to backstop economies and markets with additional rounds of liquidity provision and quantitative easing.</p> <p>So, not only has good \u2013 or better than expected \u2013 economic news boosted the markets, but even bad news has been good news, because it increases the probability that central banking firefighters like US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi will douse the markets with buckets of cash.</p> <p>But markets that rise on both good and bad news are not stable markets. \"Risk-off\" episodes, in which investor sentiment sours, are likely to return if economic news worsens and confidence in policymakers' effectiveness drops.</p> <p>In the eurozone, euphoria followed the ECB's decision to provide support with potentially unlimited purchases of distressed countries' bonds. But the move is not a game changer; it only buys time for policymakers to implement the tough measures needed to resolve the crisis. And the policy challenges are daunting: the eurozone's recession is deepening as front-loaded fiscal consolidation and severe credit rationing continues. And, as eurozone banks and public debt markets become increasingly balkanised, establishing a banking union, a fiscal union, and an economic union while pursuing macroeconomic policies that restore growth, external balance, and competitiveness will be extremely difficult.</p> <p>Even the ECB's support is not obvious. Monetary hawks \u2013 the Bundesbank and several other core central banks \u2013 who were worried about a new open-ended ECB mandate pushed successfully for strict and effective conditionality for countries benefiting from the bond purchases. As a result, they can pull the plug on the programme if its stringent criteria are not met.</p> <p>Moreover, Greece could exit the eurozone in 2013, before Spain and Italy are successfully ringfenced; Spain \u2013 like Greece \u2013 is spiralling into depression, and may need a full-scale bailout by the \"troika\" (the ECB, the European commission, and the International Monetary Fund). Meanwhile, austerity fatigue in the eurozone periphery is increasingly clashing with bailout fatigue in the core.</p> <p>Small wonder, then, that Germany, politically unable to vote on more bailout resources, has outsourced that job to the ECB, the only institution that can bypass democratically elected parliaments. But, again, liquidity provision alone \u2013 without policies to restore growth soon \u2013 would merely delay, not prevent, the breakup of the monetary union, ultimately taking down the economic/trade union and leading to the destruction of the single market.</p> <p>In the United States, the latest economic data \u2013 including a weak labour market \u2013 confirm that growth is anaemic, with output in the second half of 2012 unlikely to be significantly stronger than the 1.6% annual gain recorded in January-June. And, given America's political polarisation and policy gridlock, we can expect more fights on the budget and the debt ceiling, another rating downgrade, and no agreement on a path toward medium-term fiscal consolidation and sustainability \u2013 regardless of whether Barack Obama is re-elected as president in November. On the contrary, we should expect agreement only on the path of least political resistance: avoidance of tough fiscal choices until the bond vigilantes eventually wake up, spike long rates, and force fiscal adjustment on the political system.</p> <p>In China, a hard economic landing looks increasingly likely as the investment bubble deflates and net exports shrink. Meanwhile, the reforms necessary to reduce savings and increase private consumption are being delayed. As in Europe and the US, the worst will be avoided in 2012 only by kicking the can down the road with more monetary, fiscal, and credit stimulus.</p> <p>But a hard landing becomes more likely in 2013, as the stimulus fades, non-performing loans rise, the investment bust accelerates, and the problem of rolling over the debts of provincial governments and their special investment vehicles can no longer be papered over. And, given a new leadership's caution as it establishes its power, reforms will occur at a snail's pace, making social and political unrest more likely.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Brazil, India, Russia, and other emerging economies are playing the same game. Many have not adjusted as advanced economies' weakness reduces the room for export-led growth; and many delayed structural reforms needed to boost private-sector development and productivity growth, while embracing a model of state capitalism that will soon reveal its limits. So the recent slowdown of growth in emerging markets is not just cyclical, owing to weak growth or outright recession in advanced economies; it is also structural.</p> <p>Similar dithering is apparent at the geopolitical level as well. The major global powers are still trying negotiations and sanctions to induce Iran to abandon its efforts to develop nuclear weapons. But Iran is playing for time and hoping to reach a zone of immunity. By 2013, an Israel that \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 perceives Iran's nuclear programme to be an existential threat, and/or the US, which has rejected containment of a nuclear Iran, may decide to strike, leading to a war and a massive spike in oil prices.</p> <p>Ineffective governments with weak leadership are at the root of the problem. In democracies, repeated elections lead to short-term policy choices. In autocracies like China and Russia, leaders resist the radical reforms that would reduce the power of entrenched lobbies and interests, thereby fuelling social unrest as resentment against corruption and rent-seeking boils over into protest.</p> <p>But, as everyone kicks the can down the road, the can is getting heavier and, in the major emerging markets and advanced economies alike, is approaching a brick wall. Policymakers can either crash into that wall, or they can show the leadership and vision needed to dismantle it safely.</p> <p>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a> 1995\u20132012</p>",
  "<p>With news of the US Federal Reserve's new money printing plans putting a rocket under global stock markets, commodity companies are occupying all of the top ten slots in the FTSE 100.</p> <p>The Fed has followed the European Central Bank, which last week unveiled a bond buying programme, in acting to stimulate the flagging global economy, in this case the US.

  "<p>With the release in recent years of books such as Richard Layard's Happiness and <a href=\"http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resource/the-spirit-level\" title=\"\">The Spirit Level </a>by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, we should have seen a fundamental shift in how mainstream politics and government views happiness metrics.</p> <p>These books, and the reams of international studies they are based on, provide the clear evidence base to support what many have instinctively known for years: that we should be pursuing happiness over GDP as a measure of policy success, and that targeting income inequality rather than average income or per capita GDP will deliver significant improvements to everyone in society.</p> <p>Despite David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Milliband all alluding to aspects of these findings in various speeches, it's business as usual when it comes to policy making, with all three mainstream parties committed to austerity cuts that not only fail to deal with our economic crisis, but dramatically widen the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>Central government should be taking the initiative but is shying away from their early promises. Despite this, in Brighton &amp; Hove is shifting our political world view by becoming the home to the UK's first Green-led authority last year. Change won't come through any single one bold and shiny initiative, but through a complete change in perspective to all the decisions we make.</p> <p>Since its foundation 40 years ago, the Green party's values have been focussed on seeking equality, happiness and health as goals in their own right, and as the only fair way to achieve the sustainable lifestyles we need to shift to. These originally somewhat instinctive views are now being backed by study after study.</p> <p>As we bring those values to bear on our work in Brighton &amp; Hove, we have retained detailed equality impact assessments in our decision-making process, despite this no longer being a requirement of councils. In the face of massive cuts imposed on all councils, a heightened awareness of what this might do to income inequality and wellbeing are critical to making informed decisions.</p> <p>By adopting the WWF and BioRegional's <a href=\"http://www.oneplanetliving.net/\" title=\"\">one planet living framework</a>, we have committed our council and our city to a structured, recognised framework with targets to shift our behaviours across 10 principle areas \u2013 one of which is \"health and happiness\". The process involves the production and implementation of action plans to enable accreditation to be awarded on our progress. Using such a framework, which is being adopted internationally, helps us to move beyond tactical initiatives and schemes which might play well as press releases but otherwise fail to deliver meaningful, widespread benefits.</p> <p>Another key way in which a council can address this agenda is through the built environment and particularly housing. With 15,000 people on our housing waiting list and a private rented sector double in size to the national average, housing availability and costs is a significant challenge for many in our city, particularly those with the lowest incomes. We are working with our own housing stock, social landlords and private developers to regenerate the city and introduce significant amounts of new, quality affordable and sustainable housing which delivers low annual costs to tenants.</p> <p>Other measures we've taken include introducing the living wage for council staff while reducing top pay to get our pay ratio down to 11:1, and we aim to get it to 10:1 before the end of this council term. The local chamber of commerce is taking on the recommendations of our local Living Wage Commission and <a href=\"http://www.businessinbrighton.org.uk/news/life-living-wage-campaign\" title=\"\">will be launching a campaign</a> to encourage other businesses to adopt such an approach. Furthermore we've protected grants to the third sector, recognising the key roles they play in the health of our city.</p> <p>We also know that walkable and bikeable cities tend to be happier and healthier, so we have succeeded in attracting more than \u00a36m in external funding to improve our public realm. Indeed, the <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/index.jsp?action=bypublichealth&amp;PUBLICHEALTH=Transport%23/search/?reload#/search/?reload\" title=\"\">NHS National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's guidance</a> shows that investing in encouraging walking and cycling is worth every pound spent for the savings made to other parts of our health system.</p> <p>In the face of the government's relentless cuts agenda for local government, it's not easy to always deliver the ideal outcome one might have hoped for in better times. But unless all levels of government start focusing on income inequality and happiness, for they are tightly connected, we will never see meaningful, positive change. We are seeking to lead by example in Brighton &amp; Hove.

  "<p>I liked it that David Bowie declined to appear at the Olympics despite his song Heroes being the unofficial theme of the Games. His absence seemed to fit with his artistic single-mindedness during his heyday years, his perpetual state of otherness and his refusal to retrace former steps.</p> <p>He hasn't been a public figure for some time, but he's been in the news lately because the Victoria and Albert museum has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/04/david-bowie-retrospective\">announced</a> that next March it will be exhibiting a collection of items from his large private archive - stage costumes, musical instruments, photographs and so on. Thinking about the exoticism of Bowie's fame, it's amazing to think that his rise to superstardom began at a pub called The Toby Jug in Tolworth.</p> <p>I'd never even heard of Tolworth until I ran through it last year, training for the London marathon, yet this uneventful suburb of pure Kingston semi-detachment was the birth place of Ziggy Stardust, the flame-haired Bowie alter ego for whom The Toby Jug turned out to be a launch pad for his conquering the world - having, of course, turned up in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-17524227\">Heddon Street, W1</a> from whichever far out planet he was born on.</p> <p>The extraterrestrial pop star has, in fact, been a very London artist, as I imagine the V&amp;A show will reflect. Born in Brixton, raised in Bromley and a ravenous devourer of all the demimonde allure the capital could offer, he's old enough to remember the London of dockers and bowler hats that his generation of pop stars transcended, out-dressed and outlived. </p> <p>His song London Boys is a picaresque portrayal of Mod-era anxiety, his rendition of Gershwin's A Foggy Day (In London Town) as eerie as the weather it describes. He lives in New York now and his creative inspirations have been drawn from across the globe, but despite that or, perhaps, because of it, I think of him as a complete Londoner. </p> <p><strong>The Guardian on London</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/12/boris-johnson-olympic-park-legacy\">Boris Johnson takes charge of Olympic Park's future</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/10/london-2012-parade-olympics-paralympics\">London 2012 parade: one last hurrah for Olympic and Paralympic stars</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/11/95-olympic-boats-company-sinks\">Olympic boats company sinks after chariots of ire</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/sep/10/boris-johnson-tory-party-leadership\">Will Boris Johnson please return to parliament</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/sep/11/boris-johnson-earls-court-project\">Boris Johnson allies press ahead with controversial Earls Court redevelopment</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/12/boris-johnson-no-laughing-matter\">Boris Johnson is no laughing matter</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/sep/12/christian-wolmar-lanuches-london-mayoralty-bid\">Transport commentator Christian Wolmar launches mayoralty bid</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/12/heathrow-source-of-hot-air\">Letters: Heathrow - another source of hot air</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/11/london-met-legal-challenge-visas\">London Met lodges legal challenge over student visas</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/sep/12/met-police-officer-rape-cases\">Former Met police officer admits failing to investigate rape cases</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/13/300-million-pounds-london-mansion\"><br>Hyde Park house, yours for \u00a3300 million</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/davehillblog/2012/sep/14/kensington-gardens-half-marathon-unicef\">Peter Pan, Kensington Gardens and a Unicef appeal</a></p> <p><strong>London blogosphere</strong><br>From The Great Wen:</p> <blockquote> <p>Tate Britain's rather brilliant exhibition on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood opens this week...One interesting thread running through the exhibition is the use of London as a landscape.

  "<p>A court in Munich ruled on Thursday that Google-owned Motorola Mobility (MMI) must recall all the Android tablets and smartphones it has shipped in the country which infringe Apple's \"rubber band\" scrolling patent, which was key in its billion-dollar lawsuit win against Samsung in the US.</p> <p>The dramatic decision, the latest in an escalating war between Apple and the smartphone and set-top box company MMI, follows earlier cases in which Apple had to disable automatic \"push\" delivery of email to its iPhone and iPads after MMI won a separate patent fight in Germany.</p> <p>The recall will not take effect immediately because Apple will have to request a ban on specific products and provide a \u20ac25m (\u00a320m) bond, while MMI can appeal.</p> <p>However, the court indicated that it was unlikely that an appeal against the validity of the patent would succeed. MMI, with Google's backing, is expected to continue the appeal.</p> <p>The court also ruled that MMI owed Apple damages for past infringement.</p> <p>Even if Apple succeeds in forcing a recall, it is unlikely to seriously damage MMI's business worldwide. But it is another brick in a patent wall that Apple is building up against smartphones and tablets using Google's Android operating system worldwide, and particularly in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Neither Apple nor Google responded to requests for comment.</p> <p>Judge Peter Guntz said MMI had infringed Apple's \"overscroll bounce\" technology, which enables users to move documents over the screen of their device and let them bounce back to the centre after releasing their fingers.</p> <p>Google bought loss-making MMI for $12.5bn (\u00a37.7bn) last year, its largest acquisition ever, aiming to use the company's patents to fend off legal attacks on its Android mobile platform and expand beyond its software business.</p> <p>Other technology companies have also invested billions of dollars in buying up patent portfolios that they can use against rivals and have also ploughed money into litigation in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Samsung and HTC, two of the largest Android smartphone makers, are both suing and being sued by Apple in the US and Europe.</p> <p>In August, Apple scored a landmark legal victory over Samsung when a US jury found the Korean company had copied critical features of the iPhone and iPad and awarded Apple $1.05bn in damages.</p> <p>Apple is seeking injunctions against a number of Samsung smartphones and tablets, including its flagship Galaxy S3.</p> <p>Germany has become one of the major battlegrounds in the global patent war between makers of mobile phones, tablet computer devices and their operating software, as court actions there have proved to be relatively cheap and speedier than in other jurisdictions.</p>",
  "<p>On a sunny Wednesday afternoon, 16-year-old Vasco Mzanda limped into a district health centre in Zambia's southern province, accompanied by his father, Listen. Three weeks earlier, Vasco had been riding his bicycle near his village when a car hit him, causing him to fly off the dirt road. When he stood up, he had trouble walking and could not put any weight on his left leg.</p> <p>Vasco's injuries were exacerbated by Zambia's healthcare system. Listen immediately took his son to the nearby rural health post. But it did not have any diagnostic equipment, so Vasco was referred to the district health centre, 60km away. Having saved money for the 60,000 kwacha (\u00a37.50) round-trip fare and paid for an X-ray once there, Listen learned that his son's femur had been fractured; in the three weeks without care, the bone had partially \"malunited\". The district hospital did not have the surgical equipment to fix it, so the attendant doctor told them to find their way to Livingstone general hospital, another 130km away.</p> <p>There are more than 20,000 road traffic accidents every year in Zambia, resulting in an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/11/most-dangerous-roads\" title=\"\">estimated 3,000 deaths</a> and exponentially more injuries and disabilities. The country has less than 0.02% of the world's <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/registered_vehicles/number/en/index.html\" title=\"\">registered vehicles</a>, but almost 14 times the proportion of fatalities from road traffic accidents. Many injuries, like Vasco's, are technically simple to treat. But without adequate emergency care, transportation or referral systems, many patients experience unnecessary complications. Some suffer from neglected physical trauma, some become permanently handicapped, and others die needlessly.</p> <p>To date, road accidents and their accompanying surgical complications have received little attention in Zambia. Yet, with the number of roads and cars in Zambia growing, accidents are becoming an increasingly common part of Zambian life. In 2012 to date, nearly 6,000 people have either died or been injured in traffic accidents. This summer, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.zambianwatchdog.com/2012/07/19/more-than-12-dead-in-lundazi-road-accident/\" title=\"\">12 people died in a crash</a> in eastern Zambia and <a href=\"http://www.times.co.zm/?p=9459\" title=\"\">another 11</a> in southern Zambia.</p> <p>\"Road traffic accidents raise a lot of concern to me as a surgeon,\" said Emmanuel Makasa, the deputy director of emergency health services at the ministry of health. \"If you don't provide surgical services to manage the patients quickly and adequately, it means most people end up being handicapped. Most Zambians use their hands or have to walk to work. If they're not managed properly and become handicapped, then they get deeper into poverty.\"</p> <p>There are several reasons why road traffic accidents take such a heavy toll in the country. Like Vasco and Listen, 60% of Zambians live in rural areas, where there are almost no options for emergency care. Patients usually have to make their own way to health centres, with the journey often expensive and time-consuming. Once they arrive, there is no guarantee the surgeon will have the equipment to diagnose and treat the injury \u2013 that is, if there is a surgeon in the first place. Zambia has a population of 13 million but just 44 surgeons, only six of whom work in rural areas. Patients must usually pay for treatment out of pocket, which can be prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>\"It's depressing,\" said Makasa. \"You know what you have to do, you want to do something, but then you can't do it, either because you don't have the materials or because you have too many patients to see.\"</p> <p>To combat these inadequacies, some officials in the ministry of health, including Makasa, have formed a taskforce to reduce the toll of traffic accidents. They are trying to encourage the police to enforce laws on alcohol, seatbelts, and mobile phone usage more strictly. They are also trying to enhance \"post-crash care\" \u2013 specifically, by increasing the number of emergency vehicles and training police officers in first aid. Others in the ministry are working to increase the number of surgeons and \"medical licentiate\" officers to handle emergency cases.</p> <p>In addition, some Zambian doctors have taken it upon themselves to train medical staff on emergency trauma. \"We don't have a trauma centre in all of Zambia,\" said Mzaza Nthele, a surgeon at Livingstone general hospital. Motivated partially by the number of \"unnecessary\" emergency cases that entered his hospital doors, Nthele regularly travels to district health centres in the southern province \u2013 like the one where I met Vasco \u2013 to train attendant doctors. Making post-crash care more localised, he believes, is the best way to ensure patients are treated properly.</p> <p>\"Road traffic accidents are the type of thing that shouldn't make someone incapacitated,\" said Makasa. \"We need a comprehensive approach to address them properly.\"</p>",

  "<p>One of Britain's most unusual \u2013 and in some ways, most daring \u2013 co-operatives comprises more than 8,800 people. They have together put about \u00a328m of their money into a fund that in turn has lent it out worldwide to support fair trade farmers and producers.</p> <p>The co-op's name is <a href=\"http://www.shared-interest.com/\" title=\"\">Shared Interest</a>, the name reflecting the principle that has guided it since 1990 when it was set up with help from the pioneering fair trade venture <a href=\"http://www.traidcraft.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Traidcraft</a>. Shared Interest helps fair trade farmers' and producers' groups with the working capital they need to get their crops grown and harvested during the long wait to receive the money for the produce they eventually sell. It means that Shared Interest's loans may be used to buy seeds and fertiliser, farm equipment and vehicles, or even to pay the costs of replanting exhausted crops.</p> <p>Bankers would no doubt be appalled at Shared Interest's cheerful defiance of conventional lending prudence. The co-operative lends primarily to small business ventures, often in developing countries and usually without taking collateral as security. This is, as Shared Interest's managing director Patricia Alexander accepts, a risky line of business, something she says her members fully understand. \"We don't want people to put their life savings in,\" she makes clear.</p> <p>Shared Interest does have its own ways of being prudent, however. The key to its operation, Alexander says, is the strong link between fair trade producers and fair trade buyers and importers. \"We're very keenly concerned with the relationship between the producer group and the buyer, because that's essentially our security,\" she says. As she explains, Shared Interest typically gets its money back not from the producers but directly from the buyers, from part of the funds due for the produce being purchased.</p> <h2>Advance working capital</h2> <p>Fair trade has boomed in Britain in recent years, the overall market having doubled in two years. With companies such as Cadbury's and Sainsbury's \u2013 and of course the <a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/food/food-and-drink/food/Fairtrade/\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group</a> \u2013 endorsing fair trade, it might seem curious that there is a still a need for a small operator such as Shared Interest. But according to Alexander, the lack of available capital remains acute for fair trade producers. Choosing her words with care, she points out that many larger manufacturers and retailers acquire fairly traded goods through intermediaries who do not offer to advance working capital. \"Gaining access to the market is most important [for producers], but it's a shame that more larger organisations don't offer pre-finance,\" she says. She adds that the demand for loans from Shared Interest far outruns the resources currently available from members' deposits.</p> <p>The coffee farmers' co-operative in the southern Mexican town of Huatusco is one of those groups who have come to Shared Interest for working capital. The co-op is able as a consequence to pay its farmers in advance of the harvest, protecting them from having to sell their crops at prices dictated by two large transnational coffee businesses that operate in the market nearby. The co-operative has also been able to sponsor 80 local young people to attend a local university (the deal is that once they graduatethey work initially to help strengthen the co-op).</p> <p>Coffee, as in Huatusco, is the most important crop in Shared Interest's loan portfolio, followed some distance behind by cocoa and fruit (handicrafts is also significant). But as well as lending direct to fair trade producer groups, Shared Interest also helps the fair trade movement more generally by lending to fair trade buying organisations. One example is the Ottawa-based co-operative <a href=\"http://www.lasiembra.com/camino/\" title=\"\">La Siembra</a>, which markets the Camino range of fair trade chocolate bars and produce to the Canadian market. The producer/buyer split in Shared Interest's total loan book is currently about 40:60 although Shared Interest is rapidly trying to increase the share of its lending in developing countries. It has recently appointed staff in Peru, Kenya and Ghana to help this process.</p> <h2>Tough times</h2> <p>The recent global downturn has given the fair trade movement its own challenges. Somewhat unfortunately (not least given its name) Shared Interest's members have had to accept a 0% rate of return on their investments since 2009, although Alexander says that her board is hoping to reinstitute interest on deposits next year. As an Industrial &amp; Provident Society cooperative, Shared Interest's maximum member deposit is set by law at \u00a320,000 although the average individual investment is in fact a relatively modest \u00a33,000 or so. But Shared Interest's members do appear to care very deeply about the work their co-operative undertakes: almost two hundred turned up for the AGM earlier this year, and there is also a team of active volunteers who promote Shared Interest's work. Shared Interest's Board of Directors is aided and scrutinised by a nine-strong members' Council. In an interesting innovation to the practice of co-operative governance, Shared Interest regularly draws at random the name of one of its members and invites them to join the Council. (Most agree.)</p> <p>Alexander is particularly keen to bring more younger people in as members of the co-operative, the average age currently being over 60. \"A lot of people give money to charity, but by putting money into Shared Interest it gets used again and again, allowing people to help themselves and to gain respect,\" she says. With over 20 years' trading history behind it, Shared Interest has demonstrated that high principles can also work out in practice.</p> <p><em>Andrew Bibby is a professional writer and journalist</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
