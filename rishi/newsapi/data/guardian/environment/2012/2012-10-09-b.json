  "<p>The corridors, treatment rooms and gymnasiums of St George's Park bear quotes from global icons and sporting greats from Martin Luther King to Muhammad Ali. The one that has caught Wayne Rooney's eye is actually an observation from Ian Thorpe, emblazoned on the wall behind one of the hydrotherapy pools. \"Losing is not coming second,\" it reads. \"It's getting out of the water knowing you could have done better.\"</p> <p>The Manchester United striker claimed to be unsure why that particular quote had \"stuck in my mind\", though perhaps on some level it merely struck a chord. Rooney is adamant he has always strived to perform at his best when England called, and has \"given everything\" for the cause. But there have still been times, most obviously at recent major tournaments, where his impact has been more spluttering than spectacular and he has departed prematurely to be unnerved by suggestions he has failed to do himself justice.</p> <p>The anticlimactic exits feel familiar: there was the sending-off against Portugal in 2006, his grumbling mood and anaemic form in South Africa four years later, and the ring-rusty showing in a tournament wrecked by suspension in Ukraine this summer. Rooney is considered a talisman with the current England team, a player to whom team-mates look for inspiration, and yet the watching world still awaits evidence of his best. \"I'd have liked to have played better for England but, for whatever reason, it hasn't happened,\" he said. \"I'd like to know why, but I can hold my head up high and say I've always worked hard, given everything and will continue to do that.</p> <p>\"Sometimes it happens where you don't play well, but you have tried. It just happens. I always feel I have given everything, whether I have played well or badly. But, looking back, I know I can do better. But I wouldn't let the previous tournament distract me going forward. It's still a great honour to play for my country and I know I haven't played at my best but, being honest, as a team we can do better. I am not going to win a tournament on my own. We need the whole team to perform. But I can see we are heading in the right direction. I feel we are working well with a lot of younger players in the squad, and there is a different feel and way of playing when we are on the training pitch. It is a case of us moving&#xa0;forward.\"</p> <p>The criticisms in the summer dated from his petulant kick at the Montenegro defender Miodrag Dzudovic back in qualifying, a misdemeanour that cost him participation in the first two games of Euro 2012. The fact he had spent time in Las Vegas in the buildup to the tournament also prompted some raised eyebrows, given that his fitness \u2013 albeit in terms of match sharpness \u2013 was exposed at the finals. \"I can understand and see where people were coming from,\" he conceded when asked if such criticism had been fair. \"Obviously I went out one night and that was seen, but I wasn't in Vegas going out every night drinking and partying.</p> <p>\"I couldn't train anyway. That is why I had the extra time off. I had to have something done to my toe \u2013 there was no treatment I could have had on that \u2013 and going there was just a way to relax before I came into training. But obviously I can understand, looking back, why the fans and some people weren't happy.\"</p> <p>The scrutiny is never far away. Now at 26, and as San Marino quiver in their boots ahead of their trip to Wembley on Friday, Rooney feels more senior than ever. Steven Gerrard is suspended, John Terry retired, Ashley Cole potentially rested and Frank Lampard doubtful with a knee complaint. The youngsters will need an experienced focal point around which to buzz and the United forward is the obvious candidate.</p> <p>\"There are younger players in the squad and I always try to speak to them and offer advice,\" he added. \"I always remember Sir Alex Ferguson saying what a big help [Eric] Cantona was to all those younger players at United. It is something I can look at and try to do for England with all these younger players. Hopefully I can bring the best out of them and they can bring the best out of me as well.</p> <p>\"I understand all the scrutiny and I have no problem with it. Hopefully, in the near future, we will be coming out of a tournament and you will all be praising me because we have won a trophy. That would be great for everyone.\" St George's Park is very much about looking forward. Rooney is eagerly doing just that.</p>",
  "<p>The Bank of England could only have staved off the \"great recession\" of the past five years if it had been given the power to rein in reckless lending by Britain's banks, Sir Mervyn King has said.</p> <p>In a speech at the London School of Economics marking 20 years since the Thatcher government switched the focus of Britain's economic policy to battling inflation, the outgoing governor gave a robust defence of the Bank's performance in the runup to the crash in 2007, insisting that tweaking interest rates alone could never have prevented it.</p> <p>Instead, he said the Bank should have been able to deploy \"macro-prudential\" tools, such as limits on how much risk banks could take on for a given level of assets \u2013 a so-called leverage cap, similar to the one that the government plans to impose when it implements the proposals of the Vickers commission.</p> <p>\"With hindsight, before 2007 there should have been a cap on the leverage of banks. And the cap should have tightened as asset prices increased and the likely exposure to losses increased. That is why we now have a macro-prudential policy regime in the UK.\"</p> <p>King has urged the government to impose the stricter cap proposed by Vickers, instead of the weaker limit chosen by George Osborne after lobbying from the financial sector.</p> <p>The governor also referred briefly to the eurozone crisis, saying the historical parallels with reparations debts run up by Germany after the first world war were \"too poignant to dwell on\".</p> <p>The governor's speech came as the International Monetary Fund used its twice-yearly global financial stability report to warn that the world financial system was even more fragile than it was six months ago, with the eurozone's banks facing massive capital flight as investors move to protect themselves against a potential collapse of the single currency. The IMF's Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said: \"Faltering confidence and policy uncertainty have led to a pullback of cross-border private capital flows from the periphery \u2013 quite an extraordinary phenomenon within a currency union.</p> <p>\"This has driven up funding costs there to governments, banks, as well as for corporates and households, and, in turn, threatens a vicious downward economic spiral,\" Vi\u00f1als said at a press conference to launch the report.</p> <p>The IMF calculated that total assets of EU banks could shrink by as much as $2.8tn (\u00a31.75tn), leading to a 9% reduction in credit in the eurozone's weak peripheral economies. In an \"adverse\" scenario, it said the banks could be $4.5tn short, causing a catastrophic 18% collapse in credit.</p> <p>With the global crisis still ongoing, the Bank of England governor, who is due to step down next summer, issued a staunch defence of the benefits of targeting inflation, and sought to rebut the argument that the Bank's monetary policy committee should have shifted interest rates higher before the crisis, to rein in speculation and protect Britain from the crunch.</p> <p>That would have been a risky approach, he argued, which could have driven the economy into recession, or strengthened the already overvalued pound still further, exaggerating the imbalances in the British economy.</p> <p>\"The case for price stability is as strong today as it was 20 years ago,\" he said, adding that to abandon inflation targeting would be to \"throw out the baby with the bathwater\". However, King argued that there might be some situations where it would be right for policymakers to \"aim off\" the inflation target in order to prevent a jarring financial or economic crisis.</p> <p>He gave as an example widespread \"misperceptions\" by firms or households about their future income, in which they run up debts they are unlikely to repay. \"If households extrapolated past increases in house prices into the future, then they may have mistakenly inferred that future incomes too would be higher, and so spending and borrowing more than could be sustained.\"</p> <p>However, King suggested policymakers could not always identify such mistakes in advance. \"Are central banks less prone to misperceptions than others?\" he said.</p> <p>Other cases where central banks might decide to \"aim off\" the inflation target might be where there is widespread over-confidence in markets, leading to mispricing of risk, as happened in the run-up to 2007; and where excessively low interest rates are causing investors to underestimate the levels of risk in the economy.</p>",
  "<p>A dramatic flight of capital from struggling eurozone countries threatens to shrink bank assets by trillions of dollars, the IMF says in a report.</p> <p>Investors, fearing the collapse of the eurozone, have pulled their money out of the financial system at vital moments, making it difficult for governments and businesses to meet the challenge of generating consistent growth.</p> <p>IMF director Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said: \"Faltering confidence and policy uncertainty have led to a pullback of cross-border private capital flows from the periphery \u2013 quite an extraordinary phenomenon within a currency union.\"</p> <p>The IMF calculated that total assets of EU banks could be forced to shrink by as much as $2.8tn, leading to a 9% reduction in credit. In an extreme scenario that figure could climb to $4.5tn.</p> <p>The IMF said eurozone policymakers have tried to give money markets some certainty, but it has proved inadequate and is encouraging flights of money from the periphery to northern Europe and to countries outside the currency union.</p> <p>The stock market has risen strongly since the summer, but the IMF is concerned the market could deflate if confidence evaporates.</p> <p>The authors of the report, Peter Dattels and Matthew Jones, said confidence in politicians has waned as each economic initiative fails to unite policymakers.</p> <p>A failure to tackle key financial decisions in Washington and Tokyo is also blamed for the increase in instability, but the governments are deemed less of a threat than the eurozone and are given years rather than months to sort out their problems.</p> <p>\"Despite significant and continuing efforts of European policymakers, which have been essential in addressing investors' biggest fears, the principal risk remains the euro area crisis,\" Dattels and Jones said.</p> <p>\"Incremental policymaking has been insufficient to fully allay market tensions, despite the recent market rally since the end of July.\"</p> <p>They said problems in the US and Japan could be tackled over the next few months, and that it was a priority to agree a way forward for the eurozone.</p> <p>The Washington-based lender has warned before that the world economy is under threat from an unstable financial system, while eurozone leaders fail to agree terms for bailouts and monetary easing.</p> <p>European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi has garnered praise for his efforts to protect weaker eurozone countries in case they come under attack from nervous investors.</p> <p>Spain, Italy and Portugal have enjoyed lower interest rates as a result of ECB actions that cut borrowing costs. These moves have helped stave off a run on the currency.</p> <p>But Draghi has come under constant fire from politicians in Germany, Finland and Holland for creating unlimited rescue funds that could, they believe, rebound on the ECB.</p> <p>Earlier this week German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he believed Spain would survive without rescue funds from Brussels, contradicting most investor groups and City analysts who believe Spain can only survive if it accepts support from the EU. The IMF's global stability report argues that badly indebted countries need more support to alleviate the pressure from investors and create an environment that fosters confidence and growth.</p> <p>It says that while decisions are delayed, the assets held by banks also come under question and shareholders flee to hold safer assets.</p> <p>Banks in the eurozone periphery are known to hold billions of euros of bad debts that have yet to be recognised on their balance sheets.</p> <p>UK, French and German banks are also vulnerable to a downturn in the eurozone through their shareholdings and joint ventures with local banks in the periphery.</p>",
  "<p>The director of public prosecutions is exploring whether Facebook and Twitter should take more responsibility for policing their networks for abuse and harassment in an attempt to reduce the number of cases coming to court.</p> <p>On Monday a 12-week jail sentence was handed out to Matthew Woods, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/08/april-jones-matthew-woods-jailed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">teenager who made \"sick jokes\" on Facebook</a> about the missing five-year-old April Jones. On Tuesday a Dewsbury man was sentenced for writing an abusive post about the deaths of British soldiers.</p> <p>Keir Starmer, who is this week consulting with lawyers, journalists and police in a series of seminars on the subject, is keen to ask if social media companies should improve their site moderation at a time when police are concerned about the volume of offensive posts and tweets they may be called to investigate.</p> <p>Those attending the panels said Starmer frequently returned to the subject, and he is preparing to draw up guidelines against an almost daily backdrop of arrests, prosecutions and controversy. But there is no immediate consensus on what greater self-regulation for social media would look like.</p> <p>On Tuesday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/09/community-sentence-facebook-dead-soldiers\" title=\"\">Azhar Ahmed, 20, from Dewsbury, was sentenced to 240 hours of community service</a> for a Facebook post saying \"all soldiers should die and go to hell\" following the deaths of six British soldiers. A day earlier Matthew Woods, 19 and from Chorley, was jailed for 12 weeks for posting the jokes on his Facebook page.</p> <p>The growing number of arrests \u2013 often under the expansive section 127 of the 2003 Communications Act, which makes it an offence to send or post \"grossly offensive\" material online \u2013 is prompting concerned police to lobby Starmer to keep the bar on prosecutions high.</p> <p>Last month the CPS decided not to take action against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/dpp-prosecutions-facebook-twitter-abuse\" title=\"\">Daniel Thomas, a semi-professional footballer who posted homophobic messages on Twitter relating to the Olympic diver Tom Daley,</a> because he apologised quickly, deleted the message, and said he did not intend it to be retweeted as widely as it was.</p> <p>Section 127 deals only with messages sent over the internet and was used by the authorities in the infamous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/27/twitter-joke-trial-high-court\" title=\"\">Twitter joke trial</a>, in which Paul Chambers eventually had his conviction overturned after tweeting in frustration about his local airport in South Yorkshire being snowbound. \"Crap! Robin Hood airport is closed,\" Chambers wrote. \"You've got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I'm blowing the airport sky high!!\"</p> <p>David Allen Green, one of Chambers's legal team and head of media at Preiskel &amp; Co, said there could be a risk that what is said online is more circumscribed than what would be said in print, on television or in the street.</p> <p>\"There is therefore a serious question as to whether communications should be criminalised because they are in electronic form, which would not lead to an offence otherwise,\" he added. But the CPS is understood to be content with the law and is not recommending that it be changed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, police are worried about the time spent examining cases and that it will only be practicable to investigate a handful of cases where emotions are running high \u2013 such as in last month's arrest of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2206043/Neil-Swinburne-22-arrested-Dale-Cregan-Facebook-tribute-page.html\" title=\"\">the Liverpool man who is alleged to have set up a \"Dale Cregan is a hero\"</a> page, referring to the suspect now charged with the murder of two Greater Manchester police officers and two civilians.</p> <p>Andy Trotter, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police Officers on media issues, said: \"Many offensive comments are made every day on social media and guidance will assist the police to focus on the most serious matters.\"</p> <p>Police would like Facebook and Twitter to act faster in deleting offensive comments to avoid arrests being necessary and to see if it is possible to explore ways of blocking particular individuals from using their networks.</p> <p>Twitter declined to comment on individual cases and Starmer's work directly. The social network has a free speech policy that means it does not interfere in disputes or restrict what it describes as \"controversial content\", advising people to block users that people disagree with. But Twitter did recently change its rules to make \"direct, repeated attacks on an individual a possible violation\" of its terms of service.</p> <p>A Facebook spokesman said the network was heavily reliant on policing by its global network of one billion users, any of whom can report abuse to a team of unspecified size based in Dublin. Facebook has said it takes down pages \"very quickly\", although it does not supply any details of how many complaints it gets in the UK, or how fast it works. But with regard to the Cregan case, the network said it was able to remove pages set up by people with false identities, which is a breach of its terms and conditions.</p> <p>Allen Green said there was an argument for Twitter and Facebook to operate in a more easily understood way in this area.</p> <p>\"If social media platforms had a more responsible and transparent form of removing content, then it would be likely that there would be less recourse to either civil or criminal law,\" the lawyer said.</p>",
  "<p>The Lotus team principal, Eric Boullier, has said Romain Grosjean must solve the problems that have led to a host of accidents this year.</p> <p>Grosjean has been involved in eight incidents this season, with five on the first lap, including the huge crash that put Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton out at Spa and resulted in a one-race ban.</p> <p>The reaction after he punted Mark Webber out in Japan on Sunday was widespread, negative and strongly suggestive that action against the driver should be taken. Webber himself branded him a \"nutcase\"; the Red Bull principal, Christian Horner, said that it was \"unacceptable\" and that \"his team need to get him under a bit more control\"; while Jenson Button said he should \"sort his shit out\".</p> <p>\"We can work with him,\" Boullier said. \"I speak to him. We try to create a tough environment because I need to push him, [but] he has to find it within himself, nobody else can do that. He understands what he did wrong. He has to because that needs to be fixed. We can just help him, but we cannot fix it.\"</p> <p>Grosjean is a quick driver and has put his car in the front five of the grid six times this season but has also gained a reputation for what Button described as being a \"win or crash\" driver, which Boullier also acknowledged. \"If you look at his career, he was always a little bit hot [hot-headed driver] but I thought if he got some confidence, then he would cool down. He [has] won championships before. That means he knows how to start a race and win a race. The only worry is to make sure he cools down.\"</p> <p>What little patience there was will have been further tested after Boullier's comments, because he is not only the French driver's boss but also effectively his manager, since the team principal is chief executive of Gravity Sports Management, which looks after the driver, and Boullier was personally instrumental in bringing him to Lotus.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the driver's seat for 2013 is not at risk, or at least Boullier said: \"Not yet. But I expect to see an improvement,\" while insisting that it was up to Grosjean to find ways improve. \"He needs to find what makes him relaxed and how to be good and to concentrate on the right person. He needs to find that balance. It is not about fixing things like the car setup, it is about trying to make the kid confident and self-aware so that he controls his starts.\"</p> <p>Grosjean acknowledged ahead of the next race, here in South Korea on Sunday, that he would be under scrutiny and that he had to do better. \"It was a stupid mistake,\" he said. \"Mark [Webber] came to see me after the race and was obviously not happy, but I apologised and we have to move on. I've sat down and looked at things again with the team; it's still an area we need to improve. We're clearly focusing on this area for the next races.\"</p> <p>Boullier added: \"We have been speaking to him, especially since Spa. I think he will eventually learn.\" However, it is the somewhat nebulous \"eventually\" that will concern many drivers, especially at the business end of the grid. With five races to go and only four points separating Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel in the world championship, a potentially thrilling end to the season may be ruined should either be knocked out in Korea at the first corner.</p> <p>Alonso's principal, Stefano Domenicali, meanwhile, has admitted his team must push development harder if they are to match Red Bull in the fight for the title. \"We need to think differently now, because that race advantage is not there. But it [the title fight] is still in our control,\" he said.</p> <p>With the points cushion Alonso had enjoyed until his failures to finish in Belgium and Japan now gone, Domenicali noted that it was imperative Ferrari move up the grid. \"We saw Red Bull this weekend was impressive, so we need to see what we can do to match their development \u2013 or see if this track was better for them. We need to keep the positive pressure on our engineers to make sure we deliver the development,\" he said. \"When I hear that we have not developed the car for many grands prix, it is not true. The truth is that the level of development is very high, but we need to start higher because when you start there [in the middle of the grid] anything can happen.\"</p>",
  "<p>The transformation of Latin America is one of the decisive changes reshaping the global order. The tide of progressive change that has swept the region over the last decade has brought a string of elected socialist and social-democratic governments to office that have redistributed wealth and power, rejected western neoliberal orthodoxy, and challenged imperial domination. In the process they have started to build the first truly independent South America for 500 years and demonstrated to the rest of the world that there are, after all, economic and social alternatives in the 21st century.</p> <p>Central to that process has been Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_Revolution\" title=\"\">Bolivarian revolution</a> in Venezuela. It is Venezuela, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/venezuela-election-result-oil-politics\" title=\"\">sitting on the world's largest proven oil reserves</a>, that has spearheaded the movement of radical change across Latin America and underwritten the regional integration that is key to its renaissance. By doing so, the endlessly vilified Venezuelan leader has earned the enmity of the US and its camp followers, as well as the social and racial elites that have called the shots in Latin America for hundreds of years.</p> <p>So Ch\u00e1vez's remarkable presidential election victory on Sunday \u2013 in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/oct/09/venezuela-election-results-map-open-data\" title=\"\">he won 55% of the vote on an 81% turnout after 14 years in power</a> \u2013 has a significance far beyond Venezuela, or even Latin America. The stakes were enormous: if his oligarch challenger <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19858755\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a> had won, not only would the revolution have come to a juddering halt, triggering privatisations and the axing of social programmes. So would its essential support for continental integration, mass sponsorship of Cuban doctors across the hemisphere \u2013 as well as Ch\u00e1vez's plans to reduce oil dependence on the US market.</p> <p>Western and Latin American media and corporate elites had convinced themselves that they were at last in with a shout, that this election was \"too close to call\", or even that a failing Venezuelan president, weakened by cancer, would at last be rejected by his own people. Outgoing World Bank president <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-08/world-bank-chief-zoellick-says-chavez-s-days-are-numbered\" title=\"\">Robert Zoellick crowed that Ch\u00e1vez's days were \"numbered\"</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-08/chavez-win-called-by-bofa-points-to-bond-rout-as-barclays-flops\" title=\"\">Barclays let its excitement run away with itself by calling the election for Capriles</a>.</p> <p>It's all of a piece with the endlessly recycled Orwellian canard that Ch\u00e1vez is some kind of a dictator and Venezuela a tyranny where elections are rigged and the media muzzled and prostrate. But as opposition leaders concede, Venezuela is by any rational standards a democracy, with exceptionally high levels of participation, its electoral process more fraud-proof than those in Britain or the US, and its media dominated by a vituperatively anti-government private sector. In reality, the greatest threat to Venezuelan democracy came in the form of the abortive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">US-backed coup of 2002</a>.</p> <p>Even senior western diplomats in Caracas roll their eyes at the absurdity of the anti-Ch\u00e1vez propaganda in the western media. And in the queues outside polling stations on Sunday, in the opposition stronghold of San Crist\u00f3bal near the Colombian border, Capriles voters told me: \"This is a democracy.\" Several claimed that if Ch\u00e1vez won, it wouldn't be because of manipulation of the voting system but the \"laziness\" and \"greed\" of their fellow Venezuelans \u2013 by which they seemed to mean the appeal of government social programmes.</p> <p>Which gets to the heart of the reason so many got the Venezuelan election wrong. Despite claims that Latin America's progressive tide is exhausted, leftwing and centre-left governments continue to be re-elected \u2013 from Ecuador to Brazil and Bolivia to Argentina \u2013 because they have reduced poverty and inequality and taken control of energy resources to benefit the excluded majority.</p> <p>That is what Ch\u00e1vez has been able to do on a grander scale, using Venezuela's oil income and publicly owned enterprises to slash <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/venezuela-2012-09.pdf\" title=\"\">poverty by half and extreme poverty by 70%</a>, massively expanding access to health and education, sharply boosting the minimum wage and pension provision, halving unemployment, and giving slum communities direct control over social programmes.</p> <p>To visit any rally or polling station during the election campaign was to be left in no doubt as to who Ch\u00e1vez represents: the poor, the non-white, the young, the disabled \u2013 in other words, the dispossessed majority who have again returned him to power. Euphoria at the result among the poor was palpable: in the foothills of the Andes on Monday groups of red-shirted hillside farmers chanted and waved flags at any passerby.</p> <p>Of course there is also no shortage of government failures and weaknesses which the opposition was able to target: from runaway violent crime to corruption, lack of delivery and economic diversification, and over-dependence on one man's charismatic leadership. And the <a href=\"http://transition.usaid.gov/performance/cbj/158267.pdf\" title=\"\">US-financed opposition campaign</a> was a much more sophisticated affair than in the past. Capriles presented himself as \"centre-left\", despite his hard right background, and promised to maintain some Chavista social programmes.</p> <p>But even so, the Venezuelan president ended up almost 11 points ahead. And the opposition's attempt to triangulate to the left only underlines the success of&#xa0;Ch\u00e1vez in changing Venezuela's society and political terms of trade. He has shown himself to be the most electorally successful radical left leader in history. His re-election now gives him the chance to ensure Venezuela's transformation is deep enough to survive him, to overcome the administration's failures and help entrench the process of change across the continent.</p> <p>Venezuela's revolution doesn't offer a political model that can be directly transplanted elsewhere, not least because oil revenues allow it to target resources on the poor without seriously attacking the interests of the wealthy. But its innovative social programmes, experiments in direct democracy and success in bringing resources under public control offer lessons to anyone interested in social justice and new forms of socialist politics in the rest of the world.</p> <p>For all their problems and weaknesses, Venezuela and its Latin American allies have demonstrated that it's no longer necessary to accept a failed economic model, as many social democrats in Europe still do. They have shown it's possible to be both genuinely progressive and popular. Cynicism and media-fuelled ignorance have prevented many who would naturally identify with Latin America's transformation from recognising its significance. But Ch\u00e1vez's re-election has now ensured that the process will continue \u2013 and that the space for 21st-century alternatives will grow.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",

  "<p>In his review, Labour MP Jon Cruddas criticises the book Britannia Unchained as \"extreme\", \"destructive\" and \"unpatriotic\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/27/britannia-unchained-global-lessons-review\" title=\"\">A route map to chaos</a>, 29 September). The book, which I co-authored with fellow Conservative MPs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/elizabeth-truss\" title=\"\">Liz Truss</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priti_Patel\" title=\"\">Priti Patel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2012/sep/17/kwasi-kwarteng-work-opt-out-culture-video\" title=\"\">Kwasi Kwarteng</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-skidmore\" title=\"\">Chris Skidmore</a>, takes a big-picture look at Britain in the 21st century.</p> <p>To thrive amid increasingly intense global competition, we argue, Britain needs to pay off its debts, plug the skills gap, create a fertile climate for innovation, and ensure that hard work pays. Cruddas acknowledges that Britain faces \"a fundamental choice \u2013 whether to manage decline or confront today's global challenges\". He breezily accepts that \"many of the remedies put forward here are pretty self-evident\" \u2013 a grudging compliment, and tacit admission of Labour failures after 13 years in power.</p> <p>But in the same breath he claims the book reveals a \"destructive economic liberalism\" where \"the state is assumed always to be malign\". This is impossible to reconcile with our focus on the pivotal role of state education in delivering economic competitiveness and social mobility \u2013 which has declined since the war \u2013 not to mention, for example, the lessons drawn from the role of the state in promoting venture capital for hi-tech startups in Israel.</p> <p>Cruddas claims we believe that \"banking crises are simply part of the natural order of things\", yet we painstakingly chart the smarter regulation of Canadian banks (higher capital ratios, stronger competition law, boring culture).</p> <p>He accuses us of depicting a \"binary world\" where \"the choice is between regulation and dynamism\", with a \"sink or swim\" mentality. True, we complain about the decline in UK economic competitiveness \u2013 from 4th to 13th on the <a href=\"http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-competitiveness\" title=\"\">World Economic Forum rankings</a> under Labour \u2013 but not least because it left Britain with 18% youth unemployment.</p> <p>Far from trumping the \"notion of community, society or indeed country\", our economic liberalism cries out for aspiration and a meritocratic vision of social fairness. Rewarding hard work \u2013 tackling welfare dependency, overhauling marginal tax rates, cutting red tape for startups \u2013 would boost enterprise and bolster social mobility. You can't help your background or innate talents, but anyone can graft. Why bother, if it doesn't pay?</p> <p>Likewise, we highlight <a href=\"http://www.niesr.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">research</a> by the National Institute of Economic and&#xa0;Social Research equating the national debt inherited by the coalition with a tax bill of \u00a3200,000 for each child&#xa0;growing up today. Labour's debt legacy threatens intergenerational injustice on&#xa0;a scale that dwarfs current grievances&#xa0;over cuts.</p> <p>Finally, we are accused of \"a brutal and destructive creed at odds with national interest\", not least because we don't pursue \"Britain's place within Europe\". In reality, we call for an outward-looking, global perspective that recognises the exponential rise of countries from Asia to Latin America.</p> <p>The fatal flaw in Cruddas's analysis is not merely that he tries to shoehorn us into his own prejudices \u2013 in direct contradiction of what we write \u2013 but that he fails to recognise the world as it is. Global competition means Britain must up its game, otherwise decline beckons and falling living standards risk becoming permanent. Ed Miliband handed Cruddas his \"blank piece of paper\" to come up with some concrete Labour policies. Furious critique is no substitute for credible answers.</p>",
  "<p>Senior Tories are at odds over the environment amid fears that climate change sceptics in the government are seeking to slow the pace of the introduction of renewable energy.</p> <p>Greg Barker, the climate change minister who has been a key figure in pressing the green agenda in the party, said it was vital to \"make a stronger case\" on the importance of renewable energy.</p> <p>Barker spoke out shortly after Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, warned of the dangers of \"unintended consequences of renewable energy\" in the countryside.</p> <p>The contrasting messages from the two ministers highlighted sharp divisions within the government over climate change in the wake of the recent cabinet reshuffle. Paterson has been praised by the former chancellor Lord Lawson of Blaby, who is a sceptic.</p> <p>Paterson told the Tory conference of concerns in his Shropshire constituency about wind farms and fears among dairy farmers who are being outbid for land by farmers who want to grow maize for anaerobic digestion.</p> <p>\"These are the unintended consequences of renewable technology,\" he said. \"They risk upsetting the delicate balance of interests that underpins our living, working countryside.\"</p> <p>In his speech to the conference, Barker said that renewable energy will be a major source of economic growth and of job creation. He added: \"We have a distinct Conservative approach that puts jobs, growth and value for money at the centre of our green agenda.\"</p> <p>His speech came after the leaking to the Times of a letter in which seven global energy companies expressed concerns about uncertainty over the government's approach to renewable energy. Barker insisted that the government has not had a change of heart.</p> <p>Barker framed his argument against Labour but it appeared he may have had ministerial colleagues in mind. He said: \"Unlike Labour we don't have a blinkered hairshirt view of the climate change agenda. We know it doesn't have to hurt to work. For Labour climate policy will always be more like \"Fifty Shades of Green\". We reject the false notion that you have to choose between cheap fossil fuels or expensive clean energy.\"</p> <p>Barker later warned Tories not to cede the green agenda to the Lib Dems. He said: \"We are not going to let the Lib Dems hijack the green agenda. It is a core part of the modernisation of the Conservative party and we are not going backwards.</p> <p>\"We are proud of what we have done in government but we need to make a stronger case to get the message over that the green agenda is here to stay. But it is a distinctive vision in contrast to the high cost anti-business Labour alternative.\"</p>",

It's not about us being excessive.\u201d</p> <p>Church, who gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry, said she felt Cameron was \u201cunder pressure\u201d from editors or the general press \u201cto keep this same old regulatory system which isn't working\u201d.</p> <p>But she said it was important for change to be introduced to ensure the victims who gave evidence to the year long inquiry had not done so in vain.</p> <p>Evan Harris, the former Liberal Democrat MP and associate director of the Hacked Off campaign, said the \u201ctake home\u201d message from the meeting was that lord Leveson should feel \u201cperfectly free to write whatever recommendations he feels he needs to write on hearing a year of evidence without fearing that because of something he wants to put in, that will be rejected. There was no sign from that meeting that that was likely to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Brian Cathcart, who founded the Hacked Off campaign, said the meeting had been productive.

As a Labour councillor, I was something of an intruder. I went a little red at the hotel reception, mumbling apologetically that I wasn\u2019t \u201cactually a Tory\u201d and feeling shell shocked at the huge numbers of powerful looking men in corporate suits. But as it turned out, one group of Conservatives were far more frightening than any other. These are the \"nice guys\", and they pose a serious electoral threat to Labour.</p> <p>This group is not a formal alliance, but they are all critical of economic liberalism. They are prepared to challenge the market when it isn\u2019t working for people, and they have a genuine concern for the poor. They are socially conservative, and believe in family, community and tradition. They admit that 1979 brought problems as well as benefits. They are sceptical of big business wielding too much power and stick up for strivers, whether they work in the public or private sector. They believe there is such a thing as society. They are, in essence, One Nation Tories.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/graemearcher/100184381/what-do-tory-activists-want-how-about-an-end-to-the-smug-upper-class-stereotype-andrew-mitchell-embodies/\">&#xa0;\u2022 Graeme Archer at the Telegraph says the Andrew Mitchell affair illustrates what could be the biggest problem facing the Tories.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Defeating Labour isn't the same thing as securing a Tory majority, however, as we learned in May 2010.

Unremarkable, you might say. Parties attack each other, particularly when conference season is on. However, there is a new intensity to the Tory leadership's assault on Ed Miliband. They don't seem to have been shaken by Labour's successful conference, but they have been stirred. They appear to appreciate that the threat level has changed.</p> <p>The old approach \u2013 of treating Miliband as a complete joke and smirking whilst explaining that he is the Tories secret electoral weapon \u2013 has been rendered redundant. Mili E has hardly been reborn as Tony Blair, but he has momentum and the huge advantage of a great many voters returning to Labour from the Lib Dems.</p> <p>This makes the next election more difficult for the Tories.

The Financial Times called it \"shock therapy for the country\", a quote the publishers apparently took as a compliment.</p> <p>I usually try to adopt a neutral tone in these blogposts, but I have to say I found the whole thing pretty terrifying. Britannia Unhinged might have been a better title.</p> <p>Raab lamented the fact that their book had been caricatured as \"Tories blast lazy Brits\", but said that since Thomas Edison's time \"the average number of hours worked by Britons has fallen by a third \u2026 We have a shrinking proportion peddling harder and harder not just to drive our economy but also to maintain our precious public services.\"</p> <p>He was keen for this not to be seen as public sector v private sector - he said that since 1997 lawyers' hours had stayed constant while police officers' had increased, for example - but he rather let the cat out of the bag by adding: \"On average public sector workers work two hours a week less than private sector employees yet they're paid more and they're less productive.\"</p> <p>Raab said that \"Labour's push to get 50% of young people into university was particularly pernicious. Too many of our universities are instilling a culture of laziness\" just when we needed the opposite. University students worked on average 26 hours a week, he said - \"seven hours less than the European average\". (The idea that university work can be totted up and compared this way seems a bit reductive to me.)</p> <p>He concluded: \"We're going to have to rediscover, recognise and reward the lost value of hard graft that made this country great\" - which really is not a million miles away from \"Tories blast lazy Brits\".</p> <p>Kwarteng also touched on education, saying that for 30 years exam results had improved, a sequence that could only be seen in the \"natural world\" in terms of life expectancy. Everyone else seems to be using the Olympics as an example of everything at the moment, so I will just politely ask him to consider that physical and sporting achievements are almost uniformly on the same sort of upward curves.</p> <p>Asked about the cancelled Building Schools for the Future programme, Skidmore said private companies made \"rapacious\" profits from it. \"Why do we not then have for-profit schools? \u2026 India, China, they're not spending the big bucks on the buildings. It's the teachers that matter.\"</p> <p>If anything, the audience seemed even more rightwing than the panel. The MPs were asked by businesswoman Rachel McLean: \"When I go to India I don't hear anybody talking about work-life balance \u2026 Why do we spend all our time talking about it in the UK?\"</p> <p>Raab replied that his wife was expecting their first child, but she \"earns considerably more than me\" so \"how do you balance the dual roles of breadwinning and childcaring?\" That was a \"major issue\" for his family, he said, although he did not see it as one of work-life balance.</p> <p>Patel said of Indian businessman Ratan Tata \"there was a great deal of hysteria when he said he comes over here and at 5pm people are simply not there [at work]\". There were different cultures in the country regarding work, she said. Her own immigrant parents \"worked 24/7 running small shops\", and Patel said she shared that work ethic.</p> <p>It was left to one delegate to point out that in countries such as India and China that the authors were lionising great proportions of the population \"work very hard but for very little money\". Patel said they weren't holding up these countries as role models but merely pointing out that they were now Britain's competitors.</p> <p>A male delegate asked why there was such public hostility to the \"modest improvements\" (aka cuts) the government were making. Raab's impenetrable answer was: \"We don't stretch debate enough \u2026 What we must do is have more rigour and more scrutiny and open it up.\" Kwarteng said those protesting were merely speaking up for their own \"sectional interests\".</p> <p>Kwarteng, as you might expect, attacked Labour for having run up deficits in times of growth. But more surprisingly he praised the 1997-2001 Labour government - which didn't do that - as \"probably the best government on a fiscal basis since the war\".</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T15:23:17.102Z\">at 4.23pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50743737c0e361310bc6ca8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:39:51.714Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, is speaking now.

The general secretaries are ordering - ordering - their members not to cover classes where another teacher might be ill or away at a relative's funeral. They are arguing that teachers give only the most perfunctory reports. They are saying that teachers shouldn't do photocopying, they are saying that teachers shouldn't put up displays, they are saying that teachers shouldn't invigilate exams. They are saying that teachers shouldn't do what has drawn them into the classroom in the first place, which is to devote themselves to the children.</p> <p>I have a simple message to those union general secretaries: don't let your ideologies hold back our children.</p> </blockquote> <p>Predictably, the unions have hit back.</p> <p>This is from <strong>Chris Keates</strong>, general secretary of the NASUWT.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This attack on teachers taking lawful industrial action in defence of their statutory contractual rights and entitlements will be greeted with deep concern by the profession. The action short of strike action by members of the NASUWT and NUT is ensuring that teachers' time is focused on delivering the highest standards of teaching and learning for every pupil.</p> <p>Michael Gove appears to want to return schools to a past where teachers spent their days standing at photocopiers or undertaking bureaucratic form filling, rather than concentrating on teaching and learning.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is from <strong>Christine Blower</strong>, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Michael Gove does not have a monopoly of concern that all children and young people should have high aspiration and the very best teaching and support to achieve. In the NUT we believe this is best done in schools which are well supported by local authorities \u2026</p> <p>Our action taken alongside colleagues in the NASUWT is designed to protect teachers and defend education.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:07:14.322Z\">at 3.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50742d10c0e361310bc6ca88\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T13:56:32.607Z\">2.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On the World at One earlier, <strong>Michael Gove</strong> repeated an assertion he has made before about not being a suitable replacement for the prime minister. \"I could not be prime minister,\" he said. \"I'm not equipped to be prime minister.

I was told the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\">CBI's report on the green economy this summer was influential</a>, which it should be given the disastrous state of the UK economy overall.</p> <p>A renewed push by Cameron would be a welcome development, even if long overdue and only driven by his desperation for growth.

Shapps has not been involved with the website for some years, but the controversy has still undermined his standing as party chairman.

Before he arrives, it's worth quoting an extract from an article about the Johnson/Cameron rivalry in this week's New Statesman. It's by Andrew Gimson, Johnson's biographer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boris Johnson is trying to kill David Cameron. That may sound like an exaggeration, but the word \u201ckill\u201d was used by Johnson himself, in a column about \u201cthe basic drama of politics\u201d written soon after the Labour landslide of 1997: \u201cPolitics is a constant repetition, in cycles of varying length, of one of the oldest myths in human culture, of how we make kings for our societies, and how after a while we kill them to achieve a kind of rebirth \u2013 as Tony Blair would put it, new life for Britain\" \u2026</p> <p>Johnson is now in a position to persecute the prime minister almost daily. On past form, he will use the Tory conference in Birmingham once more to upstage Cameron. The Mayor of London can be bolder about tax cuts, the des\u00adirability of getting rid of the euro, the need for a new airport, the best ways of getting Labour voters to back the Tories, and also on any passing issue of the hour, such as the atrocious manners of Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip who called the police plebs. Cameron, as the cautious voice of the establishment, cannot match Johnson the Merry England maverick on any of these subjects.</p> <p>Over the next three years, we can expect Johnson to bend every sinew to demonstrate that he is the party\u2019s greatest electoral asset and the one man who could lead it to an overall majority. He will try to become the person to whom the party feels compelled to turn. It is notable that he is already spoken of as a man for the top job or for no job at all. If he does one day supplant Cameron, he will regard it as belated recognition of his natural supremacy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:19.139Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f3b558f91d7bbadac138\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:51:49.503Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris bingo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We're going to be playing Boris bingo during Johnson's speech, which starts in about 10 minutes. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-speech-bingo-conservative-conference-2012\">Click here for your bingo card</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:38.657Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f22458f91d7bbadac137\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:45:08.723Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the best Conservative conference stories and articles from today's papers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214820/Pick-punishment-May-tells-victims-crime-unveils-sweeping-justice-reforms.html\">\u2022 Theresa May tells the Daily Mail in an interview that victims of antisocial behaviour will be given a say in how offenders are punished.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2018One of the big problems for the victims of antisocial behaviour is that they feel powerless,\u2019 said Mrs May.</p> <p>\u2018Somebody does something to them or their property and they feel they don\u2019t get reparation, or feel they are not part of the process.</p> <p>\u2018We want to ensure that they have a choice.

You have to put yourself in the position of the man or woman who has reacted to the presence of a burglar and has reacted with fury, with anxiety, with fear, and with all the various different emotions which will be generated, and who has no time for calm reflection.

Here are the main points. I've taken some of the quotes from the Press Association.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron said that having a referendum would be \"the cleanest, neatest, simplest and most sensible\" way of obtaining public consent for a new settlement with the EU</strong>. Previously he said that a referendum or a general election could be used to obtain public support for a new EU deal, but this morning's comment makes it almost inevitable that the party will back a referendum (see 8.39am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was changing the law about tackling burglars because currently there was \"uncertainty\" about the level of force that was allowed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there has been uncertainty about what proportionate means are so we are saying you can do anything as long as it is not grossly disproportionate. You couldn't, for instance, stab a burglar if they were unconscious. But really we should be putting the law firmly on the side of the homeowner, the householder, the family and saying, when that burglar crosses that threshold, invades your home, threatens your family, they give up their rights \u2026</p> <p>I'm more interested in the rights of the people who want to defend their homes and their properties.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that he was not concerned that Boris Johnson was more popular with the Conservative party than he was.</strong> On ITV's Daybreak the presenter said that, while the Tories were chanting \"Boris, Boris, Boris\", they weren't chanting \"Dave, Dave, Dave\". Cameron said this because he was prime minister.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are lots of people that are more popular than me in this world, because I have to be the one who takes the difficult decisions on behalf of the country to recover us from the dreadful state that Labour left us in. That's just life, but in politics what matters is you do your duty, you do the right thing for your country.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that he wanted to have \"big stars in the Conservative party that can carry our message to the country\". He said he had told Johnson that, when he stands down as mayor, he should look for another job in politics. Cameron may, however, have given a better indication of his true feelings when James Naughtie asked if he had thought of offering Johnson a job abroad. Cameron clearly found the prospect attractive (see 8.30am and 8.53am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected claims that the welfare cuts announced this week meant that the Conservatives were once more the \"nasty\" party.</strong> When this was put to him on ITV's Daybreak, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't accept that for a moment. When we came to power there were people all over the country getting up and going to work and their taxes were going towards families in London who were getting each \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000 of housing benefit every year. That isn't fair, so I want a fair welfare system that works for everybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also rejected claims that the Conservative party was turning to the right. Citing his decision to announce more money for the NHS and to protect the aid budget, he said the party was not being leftwing or rightwing but just demonstrating \"sensible, common ground, common sense. Conservative, practical thinking\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say whether or not he believed Andrew Mitchell's denial that he called police officers at the gates of Downing Street \"plebs\". </strong>When James Naughtie said that Cameron had chosen to believe Mitchell rather than the officer who wrote up a report of the incident in his log, Cameron queried this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, what I chose to do was accept the fact that Andrew Mitchell has apologised and the police don't want to take their complaint further, or take any further action, and they accepted his apology. This is what I accept. I'm not going to go into the private conversations I had.

May is expected to indicate at the very least that the UK will opt out of EU police and justice co-operation when the decision has to be made in 2014. This will be packaged up as part of the UK repatriating powers from Europe. But it will be hugely controversial as it involves areas of international police co-operation including the European arrest warrant, the instrument under which James Forrest was arrested recently in France after leaving the country with his pupil Megan Stammers. The arrest warrant is seen by police and intelligence officers as one of the most successful instruments in European crime fighting, having helped speed up extraditions and the whole process of bringing some of Europe's most wanted criminals to justice. If the UK opts out of all police and justice co-operation it can selectively opt back in to some of it at a later stage, provided other countries do so. But this is an important statement of this government's new direction on Europe. Nick Clegg has gone out of his way to praise the arrest warrant and the broader policy of cross-border crime fighting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T08:37:55.822Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073ca6058f91d7bbadac11b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T06:56:49.424Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's David Cameron's 46th birthday today and he's celebrating it by giving a round of interviews.

  "<p>In her history of the feminist movement, In Our Time, Susan Brownmiller writes about the moment when the term \"sexual harassment\" first began being used publicly. It was the mid-1970s, and a group of women activists at Cornell University in the US were organising a \"speak-out\", and wanted to define their subject matter appropriately. They considered \"sexual intimidation\", \"sexual coercion\" and \"sexual exploitation on the job\", before finally arriving at sexual harassment. That was&#xa0;it. That was the term that described what women had been experiencing in&#xa0;offices and factories the world over, a description that could&#xa0;encompass everything: the suggestive, slyly intimidating remarks from bosses, the&#xa0;badgering for sexual favours, the constant comments on a&#xa0;woman's appearance, the groping, knee-touching, bottom-slapping shame&#xa0;of it all.</p> <p>The problem was ripe to be named. In the past week, as part of the fall-out from Jimmy Savile's alleged predations, there have been constant reminders of&#xa0;that era, of the casual sexism, often tipping into outright misogyny, that affected so many women in the workplace. DJ Liz Kershaw, for instance, has said she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/06/dj-liz-kershaw-routinely-groped-bbc\" title=\"\">routinely groped</a> by another presenter when working at Radio 1 in the 1980s; while broadcasting, she would suddenly feel \"wandering hands up my jumper fondling my breasts\".</p> <p>The broadcaster Sandi Toksvig has also said she was groped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/07/sandi-toksvig-i-was-groped-on-air\" title=\"\">\"on air, by a famous individual\"</a> in that decade, in her early 20s, and \"everybody thought it was amusing. There was a sort of shrugged-shoulder approach to the whole thing\". In response, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2214350/JANET-STREET-PORTER-More-men-TV-just-Jimmy-Savile-women-sex-playthings.html\" title=\"\">Janet Street-Porter wrote</a> that, in the media back then, she knew of one comedian who \"would wave his penis at horrified women in the makeup department\".</p> <p>These comments have, predictably, been dismissed by some. The former breakfast presenter Mike Smith has said, for instance, of Kershaw's claims about the atmosphere of Radio 1 back then that it was actually \"more camp than predatory\". And others, while accepting that sexual harassment was rife in the 70s and 80s, have suggested it has all changed for women in the workplace now. The implication is that a combination of awareness, women's growing economic power and legislation that began with the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act and has been updated repeatedly, has stamped out the problem.</p> <p>Laura Bates, who set up the website <a href=\"http://www.everydaysexism.com/\" title=\"\">Everyday Sexism</a> earlier this year, isn't so sure. Like those 1970s speak-outs, her site allows women to share their experiences, and over the course of six months 7,500 entries have poured in, \"thousands of which pertain specifically to workplace harassment, workplace sexism and sadly, in many cases, workplace sexual assault and even rape\". \"What I don't know is whether the prevalence has diminished or not [since the 70s],\" she says. \"But I do know that an Equal Opportunities Commission report in 2000 said that 50% of women still experience sexual harassment in the workplace.\"</p> <p>Strong, recent statistical evidence is&#xa0;lacking, but <a href=\"http://www.equalitylaw.co.uk/news/2378/66/Half-of-female-workforce-fear-sexual-harassment-at-work/\" title=\"\">a survey of 3,400 women</a> conducted for the website AdviseMeBarrister.com earlier this year found half had been harassed in the workplace, and, of those who had, four in 10 had been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable. A&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2011/11/15/gIQACBryPN_story.html\" title=\"\">2011 poll</a> for the Washington Post and ABC News found a quarter of women had been harassed at work. And the experiences that women report on Bates's website horribly echo those from the 70s.</p> <p>One woman writes that while working on a film shoot a couple of years ago, one of the directors \"slapped my arse to get my attention\"; a male colleague she discussed this with later said she \"should lighten up\" and take it as a joke. Another woman was asked by her boss, in front of 30 colleagues, \"if I wax my crack\"; another heard a global leader say to a female colleague who was doing some filing that \"he liked a woman on her knees\"; one was asked, at interview, about her sex life, and told she was expected to be \"tits and arse\"; still another wrote that, although she is over 40 and a professional who dresses conservatively, \"in the course of one business day I had one client comment on my looks and figure, and another business contact comment he 'liked my tits' and ask about my bikini line.\"</p> <p>But surely the boob-groping is over? That was the response of one of my colleagues when discussing this matter. Surely that, at least, was left behind in the 70s? Siobhan Endean, equalities officer at Unite, laughs at the thought, and says she has plenty of \"examples where women have been physically attacked in the workplace, definitely. I&#xa0;don't think that has changed.\" Bates agrees and quotes more examples that&#xa0;have been sent to her. \"'Every time I climbed up the ladder into the storeroom, my boss would slap me on&#xa0;the bottom. I needed the job, so I&#xa0;didn't say anything for a very long time.' Or, here's another one: 'Once raped by a colleague on a night out, guess who lost their job? (Not him).' There are hundreds of them.\"</p> <p>So why is there this idea that workplaces are so much better now? Part of it, perhaps, is that sexual harassment affects women at different times in their lives. Endean says it is a&#xa0;particular problem, for instance, for&#xa0;young female apprentices in male-dominated workplaces and, anecdotally, many of us are affected by the issue when we start work in our late teens and early 20s. It's an issue of power. As&#xa0;individual women get older and more personally powerful, sexual harassment often has less effect on them, and so they believe it has been left behind in another era.</p> <p>This is compounded by the fact that harassment seems as difficult to speak out about as ever. Endean says that by the time harassment claims reach her union, women are often \"off work sick with stress, or finding a way out of the organisation, or are having disciplinary procedures taken against them for non-performance\". Disciplinary procedures against women who bring complaints happen quite regularly, she says. \"That's what tends to happen: there's quite often an aggressive response. If women raise the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace they will be told: 'It's not because you're a woman, it's because you're not performing.' Or&#xa0;they'll end up in the malicious complaints process. I've had to deal with a case of that just this morning.\"</p> <p>Not only is classic workplace sexual harassment still going on, says Bates, but technology has created new forms; in the space of six months, she has seen several thousand abusive emails, including rape threats and death threats. As those 1975 feminists knew, what's important is to stop the silence around the issue. \"I think there's an idea that women have to put up and shut up,\" says Bates. \"They're told they're whining, being uptight, frigid, sometimes even blamed for causing it in the first place. And, of course, we're still living in a world where women haven't achieved gender parity in either pay or the workplace, or in female representation at the top of big business, parliament, the judiciary. So I think women are still in an unequal position, where to bring up issues of sexual harassment and to speak out against them risks worsening an already existing prejudice.\" One that is, apparently, as troubling as&#xa0;ever.</p> <p><em>Have you experienced sexual harassment at work \u2013 and do you think the situation has improved at all?</em></p>",
  "<p>How should we react to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/09/childrens-health-screen-time\" title=\"\">studies that warn of the risks to young children</a> of spending too much time in front of the television?</p> <p>Of course it is a parent's job to navigate a sensible route through TV and, indeed, ever more enticing technological devices on behalf of children. What we have to understand is that children live in the same world as the rest of us, but perceive it differently. Personally I have yet to meet a small child who will sit for hours in front of a screen or anything else unless strapped in \u2013 and here we would be veering into different territory. In my experience, small children left to themselves find everyday life of absorbing interest and are never still. This means they need watching, a parental pressure, even though pleasurable at times. It is crucial to their development that they are allowed time and space and are helped to make their own meanings from what they encounter. In the world that they are growing up into this will include screens, and the first and most fascinating of these is likely to be the television screen that small children often perceive to be a window.</p> <p>There is a long and highly responsible tradition of excellent programme-making for young children in the UK. It understands children and it understands their needs for screen literacy. It has constantly addressed universal, never-changing values, while keeping pace with the contemporary environment. Try removing the brilliantly successful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/23/cbeebies-neglected-by-bbc\" title=\"\">CBeebies</a> channel and see what an uproar there would be. It is one of the most important and highly valued services offered by the BBC. It is a lifeline for many hard-pressed parents when the reality of family life means that there are occasions when children will be watching on their own. Good children's TV can mean time together but also safe time separately.</p> <p>In my view those who cast doubt on the acceptability of television as a resource for parents and children are behaving irresponsibly. Good children's TV offers parents and children some much needed downtime. Programmes shared with children can develop ideas that transfer into active play and story-making. They can offer new worlds, new words, new pictures, new personalities, colour and music, but most of all they can offer pure innocent fun. We have lots of evidence that children's TV can make its audience smile, and this in itself demonstrates the imaginative responses that good content generates.</p> <p>I have just returned from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipcom\" title=\"\">television market in Cannes</a>. This week it is focusing on children's programmes. Everywhere I went buyers were deploring the lack of new content, and yet everywhere more and more UK programme-makers were seeking funding to make new and exciting work. Who will bridge this gap? Will it mean more imports from North America than home-grown material?</p> <p>The problem is that the UK's unique children's television sector is being starved of cash at a time when the digital world and high-definition performance are demanding a higher volume of content at ever decreasing budgets. This matters because good does not come cheap on TV.</p> <p>Children's TV is not a teacher. It fulfils children in other ways. It should not have to justify itself in narrow pedagogical terms any more than a beautiful picture book. It should be similarly valued. The difference lies in the fact that to make the sun rise in a picture book can take one artist, one page \u2013 while to create the same effect on screen can take a very expensive television team up to two weeks.</p> <p>Personally, after a long career in children's TV, I feel honoured to stand in the tradition established by pioneers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/dec/09/oliver-postgate-mark-lawson-bagpuss\" title=\"\">Oliver Postgate</a>, author of The Clangers, Noggin the Nog and Bagpuss, to name only three. I would like to feel that, like him, I may have contributed something towards making children, and even some parents, smile.</p> <p>When children are smiling they are confident. When they are confident, they are curious. When they are curious, they are ready to learn. So please may we allow children and parents to relax a little, smile and be confident? Enjoying good children's TV together may be only one way to relax, but it is a highly valuable one. Producing television is an art form whether for children or adults. At this moment UK children's television is in a very fragile state, it is also an easy target. We should not devalue it, allow others to devalue it by distortion, overlook it, or simply stand by while it is damaged beyond repair.</p>",
  "<p>A hardline \"two strikes and you're out\" automatic life sentence for serious sexual or violent offences will be brought into force shortly, the self-proclaimed \"tough\" justice secretary, Chris Grayling, has told the Conservative party conference.</p> <p>The change, which will be brought in during December, will mean rapists and other criminals who commit a second serious violent or sexual offence will get a mandatory life sentence. Penal reformers have warned that the policy, which was imposed on Grayling's predecessor, Kenneth Clarke, by David Cameron, risks fuelling a fresh rise in the record prison population in England and Wales.</p> <p>\"Everyone deserves a second chance, but those who commit the most serious offences, crimes that would attract a sentence of 10 or more years, cannot be allowed to just go on and on causing harm, distress and injury,\" said Grayling. \"Those people are a real threat to our society, and we must treat them as such.\"</p> <p>His conference speech, with its \"back to basics\" headline announcements, marked a sharp break with Clarke's liberal criminal justice policies. Grayling, who explicitly promised to be a \"tough justice secretary\", confirmed he would strengthen the law on self-defence against burglars for householders, ensure there was a punitive element in all community sentences, and make much greater use of electronic tagging to enforce curfews and exclusion zones.</p> <p>The home secretary, Theresa May, reinforced the theme with her announcement of a new \"pick a punishment\" power for victims of anti-social behaviour and her promise that Conservative candidates in the first elections for police and crime commissioners to be held on 15 November will have a \"laser-like focus on cutting crime\".</p> <p>The police minister, Damian Green, left no Conservative in the hall in any doubt that there had been a change of management at the ministry of justice when he joked: \"Theresa used to say she locked 'em up and Ken let them out. Now Theresa locks 'em up, and Chris throws away the key.\" Clarke's much trumpeted \"rehabilitation revolution\" barely got a mention during the hour and a half law and order presentation at the conference.</p> <p>Around the fringe the new prisons minister, Jeremy Wright, made clear that the change went deeper than rhetoric. He explained his view that some short prison sentences worked for some offenders and that Clarke's approach of trying to stabilise the 86,000 jail population by capping it was no longer official policy. The intention of \"putting some bite\" into community penalties will no longer be as an alternative to short prison sentences.</p> <p>\"I've made no bones about my intention to be a tough justice secretary. That means I want our justice system to be firm, fair and transparent,\" Grayling said.</p> <p>He said he would demonstrate that he was on the side of victims by changing the law on the use of force for people protecting their homes against intruders.</p> <p>Householders who hit out \"in the heat of the moment\" needed to be treated as victims, not criminals: \"That is why we are going to deal with this issue once and for all. I will shortly bring a change in to the law. It will mean that even if the householder faced with that terrifying situation uses force that in the cold light of day might seem over the top, unless that response is greatly disproportionate, the law will be on their side.\"</p> <p>In interviews he said that would mean that if a burglar had already been laid out cold then the householder would not be justified in then stabbing him.</p> <p>Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust warned of the impact on prison numbers of Grayling's new hardline approach: \"The question remains whether the new justice secretary can secure prison as an effective place of last resort for serious and violent offenders or whether his tough line will propel numbers out of control at enormous social and economic cost.\"</p> <p>Grayling also said he wanted to bring the same large-scale payment by results approach to work to cut reoffending as he had with the contracts to help the long-term unemployed through the Work Programme when he was employment minister. The justice secretary has put on hold both the reform of the probation service and the current payment by results pilot schemes while the details are worked out.</p> <p>May's \"pick a punishment\" scheme will involve the victims of the 232,000 offenders each year who are currently given an out-of-court caution for low-level offences. To be known as the community remedy, police and crime commissioners are to be given a new duty to offer such victims a \"menu of punishments\" to chose from. These may include paying compensation, repairing criminal damage or a restorative justice option.</p> <p>\"They will be given a list of options,\" said May. \"They might want something restorative or punitive. They might want it to be carried out nearby or as far away as possible. But what matters is that the punishment will be chosen by the victim.\"</p>",
  "<p>Blackburn Rovers will draw up a shortlist of potential managers on Thursday, according to the club's global adviser, Shebby Singh. Rovers have received dozens of applications for their managerial vacancy since Steve Kean resigned on 28 September although the club's Premier League-winning striker Alan Shearer, despite expressing interest in the job, has had no contact with the owner, Venky's.</p> <p>Eric Black, formerly Kean's assistant, has been in charge for the past three matches, draws at Charlton and Nottingham Forest plus a home defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers, and the international break affords Venky's added time to consider its options.</p> <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Tim Sherwood, Shearer and the former Spain coach Javier Clemente have been linked with the position, with Tottenham reluctant to let the former Rovers captain Sherwood leave their coaching team for a return to Ewood Park. After the divisive appointment of Kean, however, Singh admits Blackburn's owners must make their next choice with care.</p> <p>He said: \"I had a chat with Eric on Monday and we know there is pressure on all of us but it is important we continue working regularly, with Eric and his coaches looking after day-to-day affairs. We are in a hurry to make the right decision but we will not rush it. We could make a decision in a week, it could take three weeks, I will not let circumstances dictate.</p> <p>\"I am going to have a meeting with my colleagues on Thursday where we will look at all the names in the hat and draw up a shortlist from there. It could be a shortlist of one, it could be a shortlist of three or four. In the meantime I would call for some understanding from the fans. Eric has to be given support, the team have to continue their preparations.\"</p> <p>Blackburn next play at Derby on 20 October and Singh indicated that Black remains in contention for the job full-time. \"If we had a game on Saturday, the whole scenario changes, but we now have two weeks before the next game. It has been a very difficult week for Eric, with three games in seven days, and there is a lot of pressure on him. He will be taking day-to-day charge while we are firming up what we need to do and we know we are in safe hands.\"</p>",
  "<p>Last year the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/watersanitationhygiene/Pages/reinventing-the- toilet.aspx\" title=\"\">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</a> raised eyebrows with its announcement that they would fund an initiative to take <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/watersanitationhygiene/Pages/reinventing-the-toilet.aspx\" title=\"\">toilet technology</a> to the next level. With 2.5 billion people <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/press-releases/Pages/ukzn-reinvent-the-toilet.aspx\" title=\"\">lacking access to sanitation</a> in a world that cannot afford to use potable water for carrying away human waste in the long run, the economic opportunities that the reinvented toilet offer businesses could be highly lucrative.</p> <p>Ground zero for the quest to find the perfect toilet for the 21st century's needs may as well be Durban, South Africa. The coastal city with a population of 3.8 million is a prime test bed to find a new solution for the water hogging commode that has changed very little, either technically or functionally, since its invention in the 1850s.</p> <p>Despite having an average annual rainfall of 1200mm, Durban, as is the case with much of South Africa, now faces increasing water scarcity. The city's infrastructure suffers further strain as more of South Africa's rural poor move there to find work. Currently 800,000 residents live in shacks situated in districts that have marginal sanitation. Durban has made impressive strides on water issues in the past decade. Tap water, for example, is now safe to drink. Nevertheless, 230,000 families still lack access to safe and hygienic toilets. Communal toilet blocks are a stopgap measure for residents who lack indoor plumbing or space for a private toilet. But with the urban poor viewing the porcelain flushing toilet as the gold standard, municipalities such as Durban face the dual challenge of diminishing water supplies and meeting citizens' increased expectations. For the world's poor, a clean toilet is not just about health, but offers dignity, privacy and a break from the daily chaos in the streets.</p> <p>Durban's pressing challenge is balancing the needs of its citizens, tight water supplies and the mandate of the South African constitution, which states that access to water and a clean environment are inherent rights. For now the city's strategy is to follow a \"sanitation edge concept,\" under which waterborne sanitation is provided where the housing density justifies such infrastructure. In more remote sections of the city, dry urinary diversion (UD) toilets are the standard. And hence the dilemma: the Victorian-era flush toilets are wasteful, but dry pit toilets are not clean or safe to use in the long term. In the end, poorer citizens want what they view as a simple tool with a handle that flushes. So what about one that does not discharge litres and litres of water?</p> <p>To that end, the city of Durban has entered a partnership with the Gates Foundation and the Swiss aquatic research institute <a href=\"http://www.eawag.ch/about/index_EN\" title=\"\">EAWAG</a> to find a solution that captures the functionality of the flush toilet without waste. According to <a href=\"http://www.durban.gov.za/City_Services/water_sanitation/Top_Level_Management/Pages/Top_Level_Managment.aspx\" title=\"\">Neil Macleod</a>, head of Durban's water and sanitation department, the holy grail for the future toilet is one that not only eliminates waste, but also generates wealth.</p> <p>Speaking to an audience at World Water Week in Stockholm, Macleod said the technology to recover waste and energy from human waste exists, but the process requires much refinement. In a world where resources such as phosphorous are becoming limited and expensive, last night's dinner, multiplied by millions and even billions, could offer a wealth of materials that could provide energy, fertiliser and even recycled water. And the <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/press-releases/Pages/Bill-Gates-Names-Winners-of-the-Reinvent-the-Toilet-Challenge-120814.aspx\" title=\"\">technologies</a> involved could include solar, microwaves and nanotechnology.</p> <p>The toilet's future, said Macleod, is analogous to what has happened with telephones over the past two decades. In the same way that mobile phones skipped a generation in the developing world, a similar story could unfold with toilets. Instead of wasteful flush toilets replacing filthy pit latrines, a future commode that uses modern technology could generate economic opportunity across the globe. Rather than a massive revamp of centuries-old infrastructure in cities, Macleod envisions decentralised water technology systems where waste would be separated very close to its source. Could such a contraption resemble a washing machine at the back of a house, where recycled water and fertiliser flow out to separate pipes? Could water, which is now generally a monopoly controlled by one central authority, follow the path of computing and telephony and become managed at a more decentralised level?</p> <p>The shift in viewing sewage as a valuable resource rather than waste will require a massive rethink by government, business and consumers. But a nascent clean technology sector focused on the reinvention of the 150 year old toilet is already taking hold. Entrepreneurs have started to cash in: the Gates Foundation has announced the first round winners of its \"<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-toilet-challenge_n_1777808.html\" title=\"\">Reinvent the Toilet Challenge</a>\" and Durban will host the <a href=\"http://world-toilet-summit-2012.co.za/\" title=\"\">World Toilet summit this December</a>. The future commode, waterless and, for now, a wizardly concept, will bring wealth to a new class of inventors \u2013 and also enrich the lives of millions who lack the simplest tool that citizens of wealthier nations access on a daily basis with little thought.</p> <p><em>Leon Kaye is founder and editor of </em><a href=\"http://greengopost.com/\" title=\"\"><em>GreenGoPost.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>HTC, the world's fifth biggest phone maker, has suffered a 79% crash in quarterly profits as the popularity and marketing muscle of Apple and Samsung continue to squeeze out smaller rivals.</p> <p>Third quarter net income plummeted to 4.9bn New Taiwan dollars (\u00a3104m) in the three months to the end of September, from NT$20bn in the same period last year, according to unaudited results published on Monday night. Revenues were down 48% to NT$70.2bn, well below analyst expectations of NT$75bn.</p> <p>Only a year ago the Taiwanese company was enjoying a record quarter with revenues of NT$136bn, thanks to bestselling handsets including the HTC Desire and Sensation.</p> <p>HTC will only comment when its audited results are published, but an email sent by the chief executive, Peter Chou, to employees in August urged staff to \"kill bureaucracy\". He complained: \"We have people in meetings and talking all the time but without decision, strategic direction and sense of urgency.\"</p> <p>Sales of HTC's flagship One series, which debuted in February, are trailing off as Apple and Samsung spend four to six times more on marketing to ensure the iPhone 5 and the Galaxy SIII dominate the market, while strongly subsidising their older models, according to the analyst Pierre Ferragu at the broker Sanford C Bernstein.</p> <p>\"HTC is entering a vicious circle of market share loss and gross margin erosion that reflects continued loss of traction with consumers,\" said Ferragu in a note. \"We see a market where Apple and Samsung fight hard in terms of commercial and marketing execution to defend their respective positions, with both providing aggressive launch support for their flagship phones and strong distribution support for older models. These distribution dynamics leave almost no room for HTC to remain visible in the market.\"</p> <p>HTC's share of the global smartphone market by shipments fell to 5.8% in the second quarter from 10.7% a year earlier, according to Bloomberg. The company released its first Windows Phone 8 models in September, its most high-profile pre-Christmas launch, but Microsoft's operating system has yet to establish itself as a serious third player after Google's Android and Apple's iOS.</p> <p>HTC's revenues, profits and handset shipments peaked in the third quarter of 2011 and began falling in the fourth quarter of 2011, when Apple and Samsung increased their efforts to control the US market.</p> <p>\"Samsung is the reason HTC is struggling,\" said Francisco Jeronimo at the research firm IDC. \"HTC devices are good, the brand is strong and they keep on innovating, but Samsung invests significantly more at the point of sale compared with HTC.\"</p> <p>HTC has seen falling average selling prices for its phones as it has tried to break into the fast-growing Chinese market. Approximately 30% of shipments go to China but price pressures mean they account for only 20% of revenues.</p> <p>Carolina Milanesi, a smartphones analyst at Gartner, another research company, said HTC needed to concentrate on sales to big \"enterprise\" businesses where \"bring your own device\" (BYOD) policies were in place: \"It seems to me that on the Android side, they tried to go for the low end to get [market] share, but that did not work much, and now they want to go back to their core. In Android I think they should become an enabler of BYOD \u2013 so focus on making Android a better platform to bring into the enterprise.\" Samsung has tried to do that but so far \"not made much inroad\", she suggested. \"I believe that HTC would have a better chance at that, as this is where they started,\" Milanesi said. \"They knew how to do it.\" HTC started out as a contract manufacturer making white-label smartphones running Microsoft's Windows Mobile software, and then created its own brand.</p> <p>Milanesi suggested that now its Windows Phone models would not be its salvation: \"The Microsoft [Windows Phone] phones are good, but they risk being swallowed in the Microsoft PR machine. HTC needs to push the envelope on innovation. It seems to me that on that side they have not had an industry first for a while. They used to lead with connectivity and integration, but have not done so in a while. They need to be more vocal about their brand, and consistent in their message \u2013 so they talk more about the company and the differentiation on their devices, building a story on who they are as a company.\"</p>",

And, as it happens, they have a far more intriguing backstory than this brief brush with movie fame. Founded nine years ago by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Walton_Laurie\" title=\"\">Nancy Laurie</a>, heiress to the Walmart fortune, some cynics initially assumed they were merely a vanity project \u2013 one of many in the history of dance. Even when it became apparent that Laurie had no personal ambitions other than a love of the artform, Cedar Lake continued to attract controversy.</p> <p>In the US, the dance mainstream has long been dominated by the pure-movement aesthetic of choreographers such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/jul/30/dance-george-balanchine\" title=\"\">George Balanchine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/sep/16/mercecunningham.dance\" title=\"\">Merce Cunningham</a> and <a href=\"http://markmorrisdancegroup.org/\" title=\"\">Mark Morris</a>. Under the artistic directorship of Benoit-Swan Pouffer, however, Cedar Lake began presenting work that was almost entirely from Europe, and from a far more theatrically experimental tradition.</p> <p>Pouffer shakes his head at the some of the first reviews Cedar Lake received in the States. \"They were so harsh, talking about eurotrash. If audiences had trusted them, they would never have come to see us.\"</p> <p>It wasn't that Pouffer had any animus against American choreography \u2013 he danced for seven years with the New York-based <a href=\"http://www.alvinailey.org/\" title=\"\">Alvin Ailey Company</a> before taking over Cedar Lake in 2005. (Asked about his unusual first name, he grins and says: \"It comes from my Martinique grandfather and from the fact that my mother was reading Proust while she was pregnant.\") But he believes Europe is a crucible for some of the world's most exciting dance. \"What's happening is incredible, there is just so much amazing work coming through. And in America they have hardly seen any of it.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397505651\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/9/1349794681127/Cedar-Lake---Emily-Blunt--010.jpg\" alt=\"Cedar Lake - Emily Blunt training\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'She became part of the company' ...

She choreographs images so potent, I've seen people crying because they relate so strongly to them.\"</p> <p>Grace Engine, Pite's latest work for Cedar Lake, should please those who admired her first, brief UK appearance three years ago: it draws its audience into an almost cinematic nightmare of paranoia and threat, underpinned by the sharpest of choreographic logic. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/sep/18/crystal-pite-kidd-pivot-review\" title=\"\">Pite's gift for concentrating movement into resonant poetic images</a> is outstanding. She divides her career between her native Canada and northern Europe \u2013 her company, Kidd Pivot, have just completed a residency in Frankfurt \u2013 and she is associate choreographer with Nederlands Dans Theater. Here in the UK, newly appointed <a href=\"http://www.scottishballet.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Scottish Ballet</a> director Christopher Hampson has just announced that she is high on his future choreographic wishlist.</p> <p>Yet even with so transatlantic a profile, Pite feels vulnerable to divisions between the more intellectual, ideas-based traditions of Europe and the more physical approach of America. \"There's a very definite difference between cultures,\" she says. \"And I can get very stressed about making work that crosses borders \u2013 in Europe I'm terrified of seeming too lowbrow, in America of not being accessible. It's important for me to try to master a language that allows me to mean different things on different levels. I have to try to hang on to the fact that I want to make work that I'd like to see.\" Pouffer argues that it's primarily the critics and theatre programmers who exacerbate those divisions: the audience mostly just care about the work in front of them.</p> <p>One key factor in the company's success are its 16 dancers. Even the toughest critics admit they are exceptional, as skilled in detailed, classical articulation as in gutsy, full-bodied power. Some of Cedar Lake's repertory might be dark at moments, but these dancers make it gleam. Performers audition from all over the world. \"I see exceptional technical abilities,\" says Pouffer, \"but that's not what impresses me. If you look at my company they're all sizes and colours. They have different stories in their bodies. I like the idea of everyone in the audience having at least one dancer they can identify with on stage.\"</p> <p>Pite agrees. \"They are quite phenomenal. A lot have come up through competitions, so they've all had to excel at ballet, jazz, tap, everything. And they're really fearless. They're willing to wing it, to fall down and fail \u2013 even if they rarely do.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397505652\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/10/9/1349793688135/Cedar-Lake-Ballet-010.jpg\" alt=\"Cedar Lake Ballet\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cedar Lake Ballet's ballet master, Alexandra Damiani, and artistic director, Benoit-Swan Pouffer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pouffer is the first to admit that the company's image received a boost from its moment in the Hollywood spotlight. When the film's director, George Nolfi, first approached the company, Pouffer admits he was wary: he wasn't sure he had the time or energy to give \"bootcamp\" dance training to a Hollywood star. In the end, however, he was impressed by Blunt. \"It was as real as we could make it. Emily did fitness sessions and class every day for three months, and she learned all the works we were rehearsing. The Emily you see on the red carpet is very different from the Emily I saw in sweatpants. She became part of the company. Once everyone is sweating together in the studio every day, the connection happens.\"</p> <p>The timing of the film's release helped, too. Coinciding with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2011/jan/05/black-swan-natalie-portman-tamara-rojo\" title=\"\">the brouhaha over Natalie Portman's ballerina role in Black Swan</a>, the fact that Blunt was known to have danced every step on screen \u2013 no body doubles, no tricky camerawork \u2013 gave her, and by association the company, extra kudos.</p> <p>Pouffer is eager to move on to a new phase. He regards Laurie's money as a \"wonderful blessing\" but wants the company to start raising more of its own funds. And he's broadening the search for new work \u2013 especially in America, where he believes, finally, \"the next wave is boiling up. In a couple of years, I think things are really going to start happening in New York.\"</p> <p>When they do, he wants Cedar Lake to be a platform for that work. In these days of straitened budgets, when touring costs are prohibitive for so many, Pouffer and his dancers are using their privileged position to be global emissaries for the artform. \"I believe Cedar Lake are pushing the door,\" says Pouffer. \"I like this crusade.\"</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond's claim that he heads one of the world's greenest governments has been vigorously contested after it emerged his North Sea oil plans could pump up to 10bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.</p> <p>Senior climate scientists and environmentalists said Scotland's first minister was guilty of \"indefensible\" and \"irreconcilable\" policies on energy and climate change that seriously undermined global attempts to prevent significant global warming.</p> <p>A Guardian analysis of his government's energy strategy has found that its plans to sell 12-24bn barrels of oil and gas (BBOE) over the next 40 years for an estimated \u00a31.5 trillion \u2013 the most oil available \u2013 would mean the release of 5.2-10.4bn tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere.</p> <p>That figure, verified by climate experts, dwarfs the impact of the Scottish government's \"world-leading\" <a href=\"http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/news/2012/05/new-oil-and-gas-strategy-for-scotland.aspx\" title=\"\">legally binding targets </a>to cut Scotland's CO2 emissions by 42% by 2020, down to 40m tonnes.</p> <p>It has a <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2012/07/9583/0\" title=\"\">parallel target</a> to generate the equivalent of 100% of its domestic electricity needs from renewables by 2020, a policy that will save just 9m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> by 2020, while only allowing new coal-fired stations that partly use carbon-capture technology.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/people/Kevin-Anderson\" title=\"\">Kevin Anderson</a>, deputy director of the <a href=\"http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Tyndall Centre</a> on climate change in Manchester and one of the UK's most senior climate scientists, said the world was dangerously close to breaching safe CO2 levels in the atmosphere. \"Without a shadow of a doubt, this is a significant and serious contradiction,\" he said.</p> <p>\"You cannot reconcile the position of exploiting additional fossil fuels whilst holding to our commitments [to cut carbon emissions].

  "<p>Outsourcing groups came under pressure after <strong>Capita</strong>, which recently announced <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/03/capita-criminal-records-bureau?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the loss of a long standing contract</a>, failed to impress at an investor day on Monday.</p> <p>There was no new information on trading and the company said growth had improved throughout 2012 and it expected more contract wins. On acquisitions, investors were told Capita intends to spend between \u00a3200m and \u00a3250m a year on deals. So far this year, it has splashed out \u00a3170m. But analyst Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce moved from buy to hold, saying:</p> <blockquote> We were not enthused by Capita's investor day yesterday which sought to provide an in-depth view of five of its divisions. Management was adamant that opportunities for both organic and acquisitive growth were plentiful in the UK. However, we have been here before. The company made similar promises at its 2010 results presentation before producing disappointing half year and full year results the following year. </blockquote> <p>Mike Allen at Panmure Gordon went even further, cutting his rating from hold to sell:</p> <blockquote> The shares now sit at a comfortable premium to its peers on most valuation metrics, and we remain concerned that its above average margins may be difficult to sustain, while there is growing evidence that the overall pace of outsourcing has started to moderate according to recent industry data. </blockquote> <p>Capita closed 28.5p lower at 740p - the biggest faller in the leading index - while rival <strong>Serco</strong> slipped 9.5p to 586p.</p> <p>Still in the sector, <strong>Mitie</strong> dipped 1.7p to 297.7p after the group paid \u00a3111m for home care firm Enara. Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> The price paid appears full (around 14 times PE) especially compared to the multiples the market appears to be willing to ascribe to [rival] Mears care division (PE 4 times). </blockquote> <p>Overall the market moved lower as investors remained cautious after the IMF cut its global growth forecasts, German chancellor Angela Merkel visited Athens amid mass protests and EU finance ministers discussed the never-ending eurozone crisis, with a possible bailout for Spain still hovering over events. Growing tensions with Iran also seemed to hit sentiment. So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 31.49 points lower at 5810.25.</p> <p>But with hopes that China would act to stimulate its economy, mining groups were pushed higher. <strong>Vedanta Resources </strong>rose 22p to \u00a310.90 and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> added 45.5p to \u00a330.30 despite both issuing downbeat statements.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> climbed 11.8p to 381.3p after a positive note from JP Morgan Cazenove while <strong>Schroders</strong> rose 9p to \u00a315.41 after Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation on the asset manager from underweight to equalweight:</p> <blockquote> We upgrade Schroders as product breadth in key allocation areas (e.g. multi-asset) and in geographical distribution, combined with reduced pressure in European retail, mean that our estimates are now marginally ahead of consensus. <br> </blockquote> <p>But temporary power supplier <strong>Aggreko</strong> fell 79p to \u00a322.40, after analysts at HSBC moved from overweight to neutral.</p> <p>Software group <strong>Sage</strong> slipped 6.8p to 306p as Roger Phillips at Merchant Securities played down takeover talk:</p> <blockquote> The shares have been ramped by recent bid rumours. The timing of an exit would seem strange, considering management recently presented a multi-year strategy to generate growth. While we believe Sage may well ultimately exit to private equity or certain trade buyers, probably at a low teens EBITDA multiple, we think the current chief executive's growth plan will be given more time first. <br> In the short term, at 16 times 2012 estimates, the shares look slightly toppy ahead of a likely-moribund full year results announcement. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Bank of America/Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on Sage from buy to neutral after the recent strong rally in the shares.</p> <p><strong>CRH</strong> closed 40p lower at \u00a311.43 after the Irish building materials company ended talks about taking a stake in Indian group Jaypee's cement business.</p> <p><strong>Pennon</strong> slipped 9p to 724.5p after the water company bought the wonderfully named Pulp Friction, a paper collection and processing business, for \u00a39m.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Greene King</strong> dropped 25.5p to 599p as analysts at Barclays moved from overweight to equalweight.

  "<p>The young authors of Britannia Unchained - a manifesto for the new Tory right - set out their stall on the Conservative conference fringe this afternoon.</p> <p>In their book MPs Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss (who was absent) call for a Britain of extreme economic liberalism in which, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/27/britannia-unchained-global-lessons-review\">in the words of Labour's Jon Cruddas</a>, \"their ideal worker is one prepared to work long hours, commute long distances and expect no employment protection and low pay\". The Financial Times called it \"shock therapy for the country\", a quote the publishers apparently took as a compliment.</p> <p>I usually try to adopt a neutral tone in these blogposts, but I have to say I found the whole thing pretty terrifying. Britannia Unhinged might have been a better title.<br><br>Raab lamented the fact that their book had been caricatured as \"Tories blast lazy Brits\", but said that since Thomas Edison's time (he died in 1931) \"the average number of hours worked by Britons has fallen by a third \u2026 We have a shrinking proportion peddling harder and harder not just to drive our economy but also to maintain our precious public services.\"</p> <p>He was keen for this not to be seen as public sector v private sector - he said that since 1997 lawyers' hours had stayed constant while police officers' had increased, for example - but he rather let the cat out of the bag by adding: \"On average public sector workers work two hours a week less than private sector employees yet they're paid more and they're less productive.\"</p> <p>Raab said that \"Labour's push to get 50% of young people into university was particularly pernicious. Too many of our universities are instilling a culture of laziness\" just when we needed the opposite. University students worked on average 26 hours a week, he said - \"seven hours less than the European average\". (The idea that university work can be totted up and compared this way seems a bit reductive to me.)</p> <p>He concluded: \"We're going to have to rediscover, recognise and reward the lost value of hard graft that made this country great\" - which really is not a million miles away from \"Tories blast lazy Brits\".</p> <p>Kwarteng also touched on education, saying that for 30 years exam results had improved, a sequence that could only be seen in the \"natural world\" in terms of life expectancy. Everyone else seems to be using the Olympics as an example of everything at the moment, so I will just politely ask him to consider that physical and sporting achievements are almost uniformly on the same sort of upward curves.</p> <p>Asked about the cancelled Building Schools for the Future programme, Skidmore said private companies made \"rapacious\" profits from it. \"Why do we not then have for-profit schools? \u2026 India, China, they're not spending the big bucks on the buildings. It's the teachers that matter.\"</p> <p>If anything, the audience seemed even more rightwing than the panel. The MPs were asked by businesswoman Rachel McLean: \"When I go to India I don't hear anybody talking about work-life balance \u2026 Why do we spend all our time talking about it in the UK?\"</p> <p>Raab replied that his wife was expecting their first child, but she \"earns considerably more than me\" so \"how do you balance the dual roles of breadwinning and childcaring?\" That was a \"major issue\" for his family, he said, although he did not see it as one of work-life balance.</p> <p>Patel said of Indian businessman Ratan Tata \"there was a great deal of hysteria when he said he comes over here and at 5pm people are simply not there [at work]\". There were different cultures in the country regarding work, she said. Her own immigrant parents \"worked 24/7 running small shops\", and Patel said she shared that work ethic.</p> <p>It was left to one delegate to point out that in countries such as India and China that the authors were lionising great proportions of the population \"work very hard but for very little money\". Patel said they weren't holding up these countries as role models but merely pointing out that they were now Britain's competitors.</p> <p>A male delegate asked why there was such public hostility to the \"modest improvements\" (aka cuts) the government were making. Raab's impenetrable answer was: \"We don't stretch debate enough \u2026 What we must do is have more rigour and more scrutiny and open it up.\" Kwarteng said those protesting were merely speaking up for their own \"sectional interests\".</p> <p>Kwarteng, as you might expect, attacked Labour for having run up deficits in times of growth. But more surprisingly he praised the 1997-2001 Labour government - which didn't do that - as \"probably the best government on a fiscal basis since the war\".</p>",
  "<p>Not speaking in any official capacity here. Not as an NPR host, not as an employee of WNYC, not even as a co-conspirator to undermine American values with liberal bias and too many stories about the third world, modern dance and kelp. I write this, basically, as an earthling with the capacity for reason.</p> <p>The issue is the ongoing funding of public broadcasting, a reliable hot button of the culture wars. <a href=\"http://www.conservativeactionalerts.com/\">Conservative Action Alerts</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"NPR is notorious for being a leftwing propaganda machine. Do you really want your tax dollars going to fund such a media outlet?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>(Suggested answer: <em>NO! That is tyranny!</em>) That sentiment is often accompanied by talk of economic extremis \u2013 that we simply can't afford the expense of informing, educating and culturally enriching our nation. For instance, Senator Jim DeMint (Republican, South Carolina) and Representative Doug Lamborn (Republican, Colorado) have called for the <a href=\"http://cnsnews.com/news/article/demint-and-lamborn-defund-npr-and-pbs\">Corporation for Public Broadcasting to be defunded in 2013</a>. \"While so many Americans are making sacrifices around the country to make ends meet,\" they wrote, \"CPB appears unwilling to do the same.\"</p> <p>Still other critics, notably Newt Gingrich, argue that the private sector (that is, cable) uses the glorious free market to fulfil that mission. The Learning Channel, for instance. The History Channel. National Geographic.</p> <p>Hey, let's begin there. The commercial alternative is a fetching idea that collapses absolutely at once, because the free market is a bit lacking, shall we say, mission-wise, with a tendency toward the lowest common denominator. TLC, the erstwhile Learning Channel, trades in such fare as Half-Ton Killer, a documentary about an obese murder suspect. The History Channel offers Pawn Stars. National Geographic: Family Guns and Women's Prison.</p> <p>Presidential candidate Mitt Romney says he loves Big Bird. He has not weighed in on Women's Prison.</p> <p>As for commercial radio, the biggest stars are Howard Stern, who presides over a junior high school locker-room, and Rush Limbaugh, who is a bigot, a demagogue and a liar. And as for so-called TV news, well, locate me some news on American commercial television, then we can maybe discuss it.</p> <p>Now then: cost. The obvious response to the budgetary argument is that the federal tax dollars \u2013 mainly the $445m allocated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting \u2013 amount to 0.015 of 1% of the $3.2tn federal budget. Yeah, let's zero out that 1.5/10,000; that'll balance the budget.</p> <p>Congress spends 10 times that sum on <em>itself</em> \u2013 and there are exactly 535 member of Congress (yes, $9m per person.) By way of comparison, about 170 million Americans consume public broadcasting. So you're saying Sesame Street and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/\">Morning Edition</a> are unaffordable luxuries? Here's a thought: shut up.</p> <p>Just a brief word about liberal propaganda. Having spent 25 years in public radio, I have zero doubt that the news staff is overwhelmingly liberal, as is the case in most of the mainstream media. This has to do not with propaganda or \"agenda\", but with the overlapping values of liberalism and journalism. They share suspicion of power, the impulse for reform, the sanctity of the commonweal and a worldview that looks outward, not inward.</p> <p>What is difficult for many to understand is that the overlap does not represent ideology; it represents mentality. It is a way of looking at the world that has a lot to do with engaging many ideas and very, very little to do with doctrine. Why, I remember when there were liberal Republicans \u2013 a category long since banned by the GOP leadership.</p> <p>As for the reporting itself, has Jim DeMint <em>listened</em> to <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/\">All Things Considered</a>? Could it be any more apolitical? If anything, NPR and <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/\">PBS's NewsHour</a> bend over backwards to be evenhanded \u2013 let's say, for instance, by declining (I'd say \"neglecting\") to call global-warming deniers reactionary scoundrels cynically politicizing science, or by giving wide berth to religious fundamentalists. NPR News is propaganda like water is acid.</p> <p>I'll give the critics this, though. Public broadcasting does appeal to elites \u2013 you know, that cabal of the curious who shamelessly consider ideas, no matter how alien or uncomfortable.</p> <p>But since when is that suspicious behavior? Have the culture wars mutated into Cultural Revolution West, wherein <em>wondering</em> is a subversive act? So grotesquely has this notion of alien elitism metastasized that the majority of candidates for the Republican presidential nomination felt comfortable dismissing the educated class as socialist moles somehow out-of-touch with American values. (Rick Santorum: \"We will never have the elite, smart people on our side, because they believe they should have the power to tell you what to do.\") </p> <p>Once again, <em>unofficially</em>, let me offer this counter-assertion: anybody who promotes less knowledge over more, common wisdom over study, \"tradition\" over education, certainty over reflection, and superstition over science is a fool or worse. If public broadcasting is biased against anti-intellectualism, long live bias. </p> <p>Not that the consumers of public broadcasting are some rarified club of Ivy League pencil-necks. Remember, there are 170 million of us. We're not some hoity-toity minority of cultural snobs. Mitt Romney take note: we are the 55%.</p> <p>But you've heard that before, right? The society has been quarreling over this issue for decades. There remains, though, one constant theme that has not been much questioned: the idea that Americans should not be taxed for media they personally find objectionable.</p> <p>Really? Why?</p> <p>Federal programs aren't opt-in. The law is not a la carte; it's prix fixe. You get a lot of stuff you like and some stuff you don't like, but there is no tax credit for that. In a free society, more or less by definition, the laws and policies reflect a diversity of viewpoints, ideologies and solutions with the advantage to the party in power. And on 15 April, you're billed for your share of the pie.</p> <p>Oh, but you do get a choice of what your taxes pay for. It is called an \"election\". Elected governments govern. You vote them in, and they get to decide how to spend the budget. Note to the Tea Party: that isn't tyranny. </p> <p>Unofficially, it is the very essence of democracy, duh.</p>",
  "<p>These episodes, all from the last 24 hours, demonstrate why I cannot wait for the election to be over:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mitt-romney-foreign-policy-speech-vmi-obama-virginia-military-institute-libya-2012-10\">Mitt Romney, Monday, in his heralded foreign policy speech</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation. . . . In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Mitt Romney, yesterday, in the same speech, moments later:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So to recap: we're in a war for freedom against tyranny, and for justice against oppression - a war which Mitt Romney will fight in close alliance with the regimes of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>Then we have this, from Romney's foreign policy speech, in which the GOP nominee diagnoses what he sees as the problem in the Middle East:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident. They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia. Our embassies have been attacked. Our flag has been burned. Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting 'Death to America.' These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And here are his solutions:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight . . . . I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region - and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination. . . . I will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security - the world must never see any daylight between our two nations. I will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>To summarize: in light of extreme anti-American sentiment, we must drone-bomb more, kill Iranian civilians with sanctions, send more symbols of military occupation to their region, move still closer to Israel (which could only be accomplished by some sort of new surgical procedure to collectively implant us inside of them), and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/14/readout-presidents-call-king-abdullah-saudi-arabia\">even more vigorously support</a> the <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2012/0514/US-resumes-arms-sales-to-Bahrain.-Activists-feel-abandoned\">repressive Gulf regimes</a>. In other words, to solve the problem of anti-American hatred in the region, we must do more and more of exactly that which - quite rationally - <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/06/13/u_s_drones_deeply_unpopular_around_the_world/\">generates</a> that <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/07/13/arabs/\">hatred</a>.</p> <p>Then we come to this, regarding Romney's foreign policy speech, from<br><a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/romneys-foreign-policy-offensive.html\">Andrew Sullivan, Monday</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[Spencer] Ackerman points out that Romney's foreign policy sounds a lot like Obama's . . . . 'the policies Romney outlines in his speech differ, at most, superficially from Obama's.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/mitt-romney-delusional-foreign-policy\"><br>Michael Cohen, the Guardian, Monday</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[O]ne would be hard-pressed to find a single substantive difference between what Romney is proposing as a candidate and Obama is actually doing as president.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Michael Cohen, the Guardian, several paragraphs later:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In the end, Romney doesn't have much of a coherent policy agenda and his critique is wildly off-base. His real problem, though, is that he barely seems to grasp how the world \u2013 and, in turn, American power \u2013 actually works.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.mahablog.com/2012/10/08/quickie-quiz-what-do-the-foreign-policies-of-truman-kennedy-reagan-and-clinton-have-in-common/\">Barbara O'Brien, Monday, reviewing Romney's foreign policy speech</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"Please, people, this man must not become President. Must. not. become. President. A Romney administration would be a global catastrophe.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This was reflective of the two-pronged consensus in Democratic partisan circles yesterday: (1) Romney's foreign policy speech advocated what is basically a replica of what Obama is already doing; (2) when it comes to foreign policy, Romney is a dangerous, bellicose extremist. Both of those propositions are hard to dispute (the second is harder than the first), and the combination of those two precepts - and the logical conclusion it generates - is particularly worth reflecting on today, the third anniversary of the selection of Barack Obama as the 2009 recipient of the Nobel Prize for Peace.</p> <p>Finally we arrive at one of the latest progressive endorsements for Obama's re-election, from <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/170309/why-obama\">Deepak Bhargava in the October 22 issue of The Nation, entitled \"Why Obama?\"</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[H]owever we judge the past four years, it is crucial that we lean into this election without ambivalence, knowing that while an Obama victory will not solve all or even most of our problems, defeat will be catastrophic for the progressive agenda and movement. . . . </p> <p>\"We confront a conservative movement that is apocalyptic in its worldview and revolutionary in its aspirations. It is not an exaggeration to say that this movement wants to roll back the great progressive gains of the twentieth century . . . .[including] the g<em>reat pillars of Social Security</em>, Medicare and Medicaid . . . </p> <p>\"<em>We need to protect and strengthen Social Security</em>, Medicare, Medicaid and other critical programs, particularly those serving the most vulnerable people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162258551/transcript-first-obama-romney-presidential-debate\">Presidential debate, October 3</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"MR. LEHRER: 'Mr. President, do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?'</p> <p>\"PRESIDENT OBAMA: 'You know, I suspect that on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-debt-talks-obama-offers-social-security-cuts/2011/07/06/gIQA2sFO1H_story.html\">The Washington Post, July 6, 2011, \"In debt talks, Obama offers Social Security cuts\"</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>\"President Obama is pressing congressional leaders to consider a far-reaching debt-reduction plan that would force Democrats to accept major changes to Social Security and Medicare in exchange for Republican support for fresh tax revenue.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a bit bizarre, to put that generously, to insist that protecting Social Security is one of the prime reasons to dedicate oneself to Obama's re-election when he not only worked hard to cut that program substantially, but himself said just last week that he and his opponent have a \"somewhat similar position\" on that issue.</p> <p>Whatever is awful about the American political process is magnified in the election season, and exponentially intensifies each day as the election approaches. That would all be perfectly tolerable if not for the fact that the election process is 18 months long, or close to 1/3 of each president's term. One of the most effective tactics for keeping the electorate distracted and confused is ensuring that the time when they pay the most attention to the political process is exactly the time when political reality is most obscured.</p>",

He deserves not only a Nobel Prize for Medicine, but a Nobel Prize for Ethics.</p> <p>Before Yamanaka\u2019s breakthrough, which built on Gurdon\u2019s work, this research could only be done on cells derived from live human embryos. Many people objected to the creation of embryos for research, describing it as cannabalizing human beings. They even objected to the use of embryos no longer required for IVF. This led GW Bush to introduce laws that retarded the field for years. Yamanaka was able to overcome all those objections and resuscitate the field.</p> <p>Yamanaka has opened the door to a completely new kind of medicine: regenerative medicine. Until now, dead or damaged tissue and organs, for example in the brain or heart, have been replaced by scar tissue. This results in loss of function, such as inability to talk or walk after a stroke, or heart failure after a heart attack. Regenerative medicine offers the prospect of replacing dead or damaged human parts with new functioning ones. It also opens a radically new way of studying the origin of disease: by creating tissue with disease, it can be experimented on in the laboratory, instead of in humans and animals. This is good for humans and good for non-human animals used in experiments.</p> <p>This is as significant as the discovery of antibiotics. Given the millions, or more lives, which could be saved, this is a truly momentous award.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/rlweston-inst/people/john\">John Hardy</a>, professor of neuroscience at University College London:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think everyone who works on developmental biology and on the understanding of disease mechanisms will applaud these excellent and clear choices for the Nobel prizes.

Educated at Eton, he was on course to study classics, only to receive a surprising offer from an Oxford admissions tutor who had neglected to fill all the places at his college. Fate, if a scientist believes in such things, led the young John to follow his childhood interests and read Zoology at Christ Church.</p> <p>A PhD followed in 1962, and there again fate intervened. Challenged with working on transplanting a nucleus from one cell to another, John successfully \"cloned\" the South African frog Xenopus laevis from a tadpole's intestinal cell (\"a pivotal piece of luck,\" he says) by transplanting the nucleus into an empty Xenopus egg cell. The result was an organism genetically identical to the tadpole before. This proved that cells can be \"reprogrammed\" to start anew.</p> <p>The discovery caused shockwaves around the scientific community, not least because a mere graduate student had disproved previously held dogma developed by more famous and established scientists.</p> <p>\"In the 1950s, no one knew if all cells in the body had the same genes,\" says John. \"The hypothesis was that as cells grew they lost the genes they didn't need.\" His finding proved that cells all carry the same genes, with other factors telling the cell which to use. The biologist John Haldane dubbed John's achievement \"cloning\", borrowing a term from plant biology, and a new field was born.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:15:41.067Z\">at 4.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072a567c0e361310bc6c9ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T10:06:07.873Z\">11.06am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video of Shinya Yamanaka</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's Yamanaka speaking when he won the 2012 millennium technology prize.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQmM8NjF6WY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AQmM8NjF6WY?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In addition, for the technically-minded, here are Yamanaka's key scientific papers on iPS stem cells:</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867406009767\">Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors</a>\" - Cell, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/issue?pii=S0092-8674%2806%29X0698-0\">Volume 126, Issue 4</a>, 663-676, 25 August 2006</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867407014717\">Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Adult Human Fibroblasts by Defined Factors</a>\" -&#xa0;Cell, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/issue?pii=S0092-8674%2807%29X0731-1\">Volume 131, Issue 5</a>, 861-872, 30 November 2007</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T10:51:16.860Z\">at 11.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072a2aec0e3aacd18e2f8fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T09:53:50.543Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Induced pluripotent stem cells</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/mar/13/ips-reprogrammed-stem-cells\">background on induced pluripotent (iPS) stem cells</a>, a technical tour-de-force, which was published by Yamanaka in 2007.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In 2007, Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University in Japan demonstrated a way of producing ES-like cells without using eggs.

  "<p>The trenchant clatter of breakbeats was one way you could tell Poland had rejoined the slipstream of global culture in the 1990s. That was when the country first got its own hip-hop scene \u2013 not the most likely thing under the previous communist regime. Adopting another favourite byproduct of western culture, nostalgia, the Polish are being currently fired up in cinemas by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkMDaVh3kOQ\" title=\"\">Jeste\u015b Bogiem</a> (You Are God), a biopic of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paktofonika\" title=\"\">Paktofonika</a>, one of the key early bloc-rocking rap crews.</p> <p>The film, directed by documentarian Lestes Dawid, pulled in 370,000 people on its first weekend in mid-September \u2013 the third-biggest opening for a Polish film in the last 20 years. It has not quite overtaken Agnieszka Holland's Oscar-nominated Holocaust drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146047/in-darkness\" title=\"\">In Darkness</a> as the top-grossing local film of 2012. But its explosive start suggests that it's nailed the 18-35 demographic most likely to be still in sync with Paktofonika's confrontational style.</p> <p>Marcin Kowalcyck is impressive \u2013 packing some of the surly vitality of a young Vincent Cassel \u2013 as Magik, the mentally volatile creative force at the heart of the group. Dawid Ogrodnik and Tomasz Schuhardt play Paktofonika's other members Rahim and Fokus, and the three actors are the film's strong suit. And Jeste\u015b Bogiem, superficially at least, knows its youth-flick moves: by centering its account of the group in the mercurial Magik, his failing relationship and his suicide in 2000, it clings closely to the model of Anton Corbijn's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/118797/control\" title=\"\">Control</a>. With the Katowice housing estates cloaked in monochrome ghetto chiaroscuro by Dawid, the film keeps its visual hip-hop signifiers tight, too.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BkMDaVh3kOQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BkMDaVh3kOQ?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BkMDaVh3kOQ?rel=0\">Reading this on mobile?

You get the sense they were at odds with the Catholic mainstream: when Magik unveils <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cq2paBCLSSc\" title=\"\">Jestem Bogiem</a> (I Am God), the blaspheming song from which the film borrows a title, his fellow group members complain he has gone \"too far\". But that's as clear as it gets. If the aim was to be the Polish <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/94082/8.mile\" title=\"\">8 Mile</a>, then it also fails to burrow deeply enough beneath Magik's petulance, and find some grandeur to give him an Eminem-like status. It's the scenes where he's borrowing money from his manager to buy nappies, not his dynamite MCing, that register.</p> <p>Shame, because where Poland tapped into hip-hop's unstoppable 90s planet-wide progress, here was a chance to make a contribution in return. A hip-hop film from a former communist country could have added edgy notes to the accepted youth-culture movie blueprint: a hunger for post-communist self-expression more urgent than the standard rebel ethic, and a scepticism about the marketing and exploitation of \"lifestyle choices\". But, doggedly concentrating on an account that is for Paktofonika insiders only, rather than laying open the subject matter for an audience outside Poland, Jeste\u015b Bogiem doesn't have that kind of awareness.</p> <p>Apparently, though, those sort of radical intentions were what the film originally had in mind. Its publicity talks it up as an indictment of new-era capitalism and compares it to Andrzej Wajda's 1976 classic <a href=\"http://www.fandor.com/films/man_of_marble\" title=\"\">Man of Marble</a> as a critique of a generation. Some PR person mastered the hallowed hip-hop tradition of self-aggrandisement there.

  "<p>Iraq could become the world's second-largest oil exporter within two decades and double its output by 2020, a major study has found.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/iraq/\" title=\"\">International Energy Agency said Iraq</a> can overtake Russia for exports and be responsible for nearly half of all anticipated growth in global output.</p> <p>But the country's government must overcome internal disputes over oil rights with the autonomous Kurdish region in the north and increase current investment from $9bn (\u00a35.6bn) in 2011 to $25bn a year on average for the rest of the decade, the authors warned.</p> <p>The IEA's chief economist, Fatih Birol, explained: \"Developments in Iraq's energy sector are critical for the country's prospects and also for the health of the global economy.</p> <p>\"But success is not assured, and failure to achieve the anticipated increase in Iraq's oil supply would put global oil markets on course for troubled waters.\"</p> <p>Executive director, Maria van der Hoeven, added: \"We all have an interest in Iraq realising its potential and revitalising its economy.\"</p> <p>Decades of conflict have left Iraq's oil and energy sector in disarray, but Baghdad has recently signed a series of contracts with BP and Royal Dutch Shell, among others, to raise production levels.</p> <p>This year output passed 3m barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in 30 years and the country, which has the world's fourth-largest oil reserves, overtook Iran to become the second biggest producer in the Opec cartel.</p> <p>The report said Iraq can hit 6.1m bpd by 2020 and 8.3m bpd in 2035 mainly in and around Basra in the south.</p> <p>However, an ongoing dispute with the Kurdistan regional government could slow progress. The federal government says deals which the Kurds have signed with ExxonMobil and Chevron are illegal.</p> <p>A new law on hydrocarbons and revenue sharing is currently being debated but failure would cause delays.</p> <p>The report said: \"Iraq stands to gain almost $5tn (\u00a33tn) in revenues from oil export over the period to 2035, an annual average of $200bn and an opportunity to transform the country's future prospects. Achieving the required level of oil production and export will require rapid, co-ordinated progress all along the energy supply chain.\"</p> <p>One beneficiary of the surge in oil flows from Iraq, the IEA said, will be China. The agency forecast that by 2020, 80% of Iraq's oil will go to Asia.</p> <p>The report also focused on Iraq's internal energy needs and revealed that it needs 70% more power generation capacity to meet current demands and avoid rolling blackouts which continue to affect the country.</p> <p>If planned new capacity is delivered on time, however, the electricity grid will meet supply demands by 2015.</p> <p>The report added: \"Iraq needs to install around 70 gigawatts of generation capacity and move away from a predominantly oil-fired power mix to more reliance on efficient gas fired generation: without this transition Iraq would forego around $520bn in oil export revenues.\"</p>",

Scientists were never consulted and it could compromise the international efforts to monitor what is happening to the Earth's protective ozone layer.</p> <p>A spokesman for EC said: \"On ozone research, we have a continuing research involvement, working with the World Meteorological Organization and others, to advance the global understanding of ozone levels. Our research continues to provide the scientific basis for services to Canadians, including the UV index.\" He said that ozone monitoring was still taking place, an EC scientific review is being conducted of monitoring sites, and Canada had earlier this month reiterated its commitment to continuing to host the <a href=\"http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/arep/gaw/ozone-uv.html\" title=\"\">World Ozone and UV Data Centre</a> of the WMO.</p> <p>\"Anyone who knows about the UV index thinks the inventors are among the most famous scientists in the world but no one knows who we are,\" says Tom McElroy who created the index at Environment Canada (EC) along with fellow EC scientists David Wardle and James Kerr in 1992. All are retired now.</p> <p>\"We developed the UV index in 1992 to give the public information about their potential exposure,\" McElroy said. \"It's amazing how popular it became. I think it has really saved lives.\"</p> <p>The UV index relies on another invention by McElroy, Wardle and Kerr, the <a href=\"http://www.kippzonen.com/?productgroup/26142/Brewer+Spectrophotometer.aspx\" title=\"\">Automated Brewer Ozone Spectrophotometer,</a> the world's most accurate ground-based ozone measurement tool.

This is a serious issue.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Nobel prize for physics has been awarded to two scientists who worked out a way to trap, manipulate and study the fundamental particles of light and matter without destroying them. Their work is a crucial step towards building superfast quantum computers and could lead to ways of measuring time with a hundred times greater precision than is possible using atomic clocks.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.college-de-france.fr/site/en-serge-haroche/biography.htm#|p=../en-serge-haroche/biography.htm|\" title=\"\">Serge Haroche</a> is a professor at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris. He shared the 8m-kronor prize with <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/grp10/index.cfm\" title=\"\">David J Wineland</a> of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and the University of Colorado, Boulder. The <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2012/press.html\" title=\"\">citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> said they won \"for groundbreaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems\".</p> <p>Haroche said he was in the street when he got the call from the Nobel committee. \"I was passing a bench so I was able to sit down immediately. I was walking with my wife going back home and when I saw the area code 46, then I sat down,\" said Haroche. \"[When I saw] the Swedish code I realised it was real. It's fairly overwhelming.\"</p> <p>He said he called his family and closest colleagues to share the news. \"One of them was lecturing and I sent him a text. He answered me 'I am in the middle of a lecture, I'll call you back later'. I sent a text back saying, 'interrupt your lecture and call me back immediately'.\"</p> <p>Haroche said he wasn't expecting the prize. \"There are a lot of people in the world who deserve the prize, working in a lot of interesting areas. I just consider myself as just one of the possible choices. I did not think it was highly probable and I tried not to think about it in advance. I am also very glad to share it with Dave Wineland because he's a fantastic physicist and to be in his company is certainly a great pleasure for me and great recognition.\"</p> <p>Professor Sir Peter Knight, president of the UK's Institute of Physics and a researcher in the same field of quantum optics as Haroche and Wineland, said the Nobel laureates had \"made tremendous advances in our understanding of quantum entanglement, with beautiful experiments to show how atomic systems can be manipulated to exhibit the most extraordinary coherence properties\".</p> <p>Fundamental particles such as photons are difficult to isolate from their environment without destroying many of the mysterious quantum properties that make them interesting for physicists to study. In the 1980s, Wineland and Haroche independently invented ways to trap particles while maintaining their quantum properties. Wineland used electric fields to trap electrically charged atoms, keeping them away from heat and radiation by conducting his experiments at very low temperatures and in a vacuum. Haroche trapped particles of light between superconducting mirrors that are cooled to a fraction above -273C, or absolute zero.</p> <p>Haroche said that his research, like the early work on lasers or nuclear magnetic resonance, was done without a practical purpose in mind. \"The manipulation of quantum systems belongs to the same kind of physics,\" he said. \"There are a lot of things to learn at the fundamental level and some application will come but it's very hard to say which one. Maybe it will be some kind of computer, maybe it will be in quantum simulations or quantum communications.\"</p> <p>Broadcaster and professor of physics at the University of Surrey, Jim al-Khalili, said this year's Nobel Prize recognised some of the most incredible experimental tests of the weirder aspects of quantum mechanics \u2013 ideas that, until the last decade or two, were nothing more than science fiction or the wilder imaginings of quantum physicists. \"Wineland and Haroche and their teams have shown just how strange the quantum world really is and opened up the potential for new technologies undreamed of not so long ago.\"</p> <p>Haroche said he planned to celebrate his Nobel win with some champagne at home with family and colleagues. \"In the afternoon I will go back to the office and the lab,\" he added.</p>",

I sent a text back saying, \u201cinterrupt your lecture and call me back immediately\u201d.</p> </blockquote> <p>What he will do to celebrate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think I will do is call my colleagues and children and we will have champagne at home and in the afternoon I will go back to the office and the lab.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about the potential use of his work Haroche cited past examples of basic physics research, such as lasers, nuclear magnetic resonance, that were done without specific applications in mind:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The manipulation of quantum systems belongs to the same kind of physics. There is a lot of things to learn at the fundamental level and some application will come but it\u2019s very hard to say which one. Maybe it will be some kind of computer, maybe it will be in quantum simulations or quantum communications.</p> </blockquote> <p>Did he expect to get the Nobel prize?</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I did not see it coming. There are a lot of people in the world who deserve the prize, working in a lot of interesting areas. I just consider myself as just one of the possible choices. i did not think it was highly probable and I tried not to think about it in advance. I am also very glad to share it with Dave Wineland because he\u2019s a fantastic physicist and to be in his company is certainly a great pleasure for me and great recognition.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-eb29cffd-9e6f-468f-a009-ffc30bd8ab7c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/9/1349782299694/Serge-Haroche-winner-of-2-010.jpg\" alt=\"Serge Haroche, winner of 2012 Nobel prize in physics, with Igor Dotsenko\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French physicist Serge Haroche (right), and his assistant Igor Dotsenko at work in Paris, 2009.

For single particles of light or matter the laws of classical physics cease to apply and quantum physics takes over. But single particles are not easily isolated from their surrounding environment and they lose their mysterious quantum properties as soon as they interact with the outside world. Thus many seemingly bizarre phenomena predicted by quantum physics could not be directly observed, and researchers could only carry out thought experiments that might in principle manifest these bizarre phenomena.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Both Laureates work in the field of quantum optics studying the fundamental interaction between light and matter, a field which has seen considerable progress since the mid-1980s. Their ground-breaking methods have enabled this field of research to take the very first steps towards building a new type of super fast computer based on quantum physics. Perhaps the quantum computer will change our everyday lives in this century in the same radical way as the classical computer did in the last century. The research has also led to the construction of extremely precise clocks that could become the future basis for a new standard of time, with more than hundred-fold greater precision than present-day caesium clocks.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://blog.vixra.org/2012/10/09/nobel-prize-in-physics-awarded-to-serge-haroche-and-david-wineland/\">ViXra blog</a>, \"this work was widely predicted as a possibility for the prize.\"</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:30:14.873Z\">at 11.30am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073e4edc0e361310bc6ca3f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:04:31.204Z\">10.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/oct/08/nobel-prize-2012-live-medicine-physiology\">excitement of yesterday's Nobel prize in physiology or medicine</a>, will the physics prize live up to expectations?</p> <p>We will find out in just under an hour, when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm makes the latest in its long line of prestigious prizes. This is the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/\">prize all physicists want</a>, a chance to be remembered in the same pantheon as <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1918/index.html\">Max Planck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/index.html\">Richard Feynman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1922/index.html\">Niels Bohr</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/\">Marie Curie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/index.html\">Werner Heisenberg</a> and, of course, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/index.html\">Albert Einstein</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/\">Last year's prize</a> went to Saul Perlmutter, Brian P Schmidt and Adam G Riess for the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe through observations of distant supernovae. <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/\">The year before that</a>, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, both based at the University of Manchester, won the Nobel for their \"groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene\u201d.</p> <p>Predictions for the winner of this year's prize are, as usual, a shot in the dark.

This is what Einstein called \"spooky action at a distance\" - in other words that two entangled particles would know what state the other was in, no matter how far apart they were, even if they were a whole universe apart.

  "<p>In the world of advertising Bob Greenberg could never be described as conventional. Yet the 64-year-old self-confessed dyslexic and admirer of numerology is sought out by some of the world's largest companies for his own brand of promotional expertise.</p> <p>Speaking to an invited audience at the Guardian's Kings Cross headquarters last week, Greenberg, chief executive and chair of his company, <a href=\"http://www.rga.com/\">R/GA</a>, was on the cusp of a new era. Greenberg, has instigated change at regular, nine-year intervals since the company was set up in order to keep up with technology shifts and 2013 is the next nine-year marker. </p> <p>So why change every nine years? Greenberg explains without the slightest irony that in numerology, the number nine is the end of something and the beginning of something else. \"We don't force the change but it kinda just works out that every nine years the impact of technology leads to change,\" he says, smiling.</p> <p>It is refreshing that Greenberg is not a conventional chief executive. So it's not so surprising that he and the company's management team has yet to fully decide what form this newest direction for R/GA will take; yet he doesn't look worried. He says the company is moving towards more \"functional integration\" as a way to help clients make sense of a world where the consumer is surrounded by products and services.</p> <p>\"We will be something else by the beginning of 2013,\" Greenberg says. \"We don't know exactly what yet, but we will drop the word 'agency' just like Apple dropped 'computer' \u2013 we do so many different things now that it's fine to just be R/GA.\"</p> <p>R/GA has gone through big changes. The company was co-founded with Greenberg's brother in 1977 and the two brothers began in motion graphics and video production, designing the opening titles to films starting with Superman in 1978. Other film projects include Alien, Ghostbusters, Predator and Zelig. The next phase moved the company into computer assisted filmmaking techniques (CGI) and large-scale commercials such as the pioneering 1992 Coke ad with Paula Abdul dancing with a digitally manufactured Gene Kelly.</p> <p>A conversation with Jim Clark (the founder of Silicon Graphics and then Netscape) about the rise of the internet convinced Greenberg to embrace interactive technologies, and the growth of mobile and social media has moved the company further into digital and widened its global reach. R/GA is part of the Interpublic Group of Companies (<a href=\"http://www.interpublic.com/\">IPG</a>) and has about $250m in annual revenues.</p> <p>\"I don't really like to travel except for pleasure, but as a company you have to be global because that is the way businesses are going. We don't need to have a lot of people in an office to be creative, so I believe that every office has to be built organically,\" says Greenberg in a soft spoken Midwestern accent (he grew up in Chicago) tinged by years of living in New York.</p> <p>R/GA is on track to have 12 offices in nine countries with new ones shortly opening in Los Angeles, Austin, Texas and Sydney. The London office, originally set up for client Nokia, is now five years old, has 140 staff and grown by a whopping 40% in the last 12 months. It also has the only in-house production facility outside of R/GA's New York HQ. In addition, R/GA London is building an on-site digital retail lab to test retail solutions for clients looking to integrate digital technology like RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communications technology) into their businesses, which will open next month.</p> <p>What sets Greenberg apart is that he values creativity in both design and technology. \"The technology people have to be seen on the same footing with creative people,\" he explains. \"There has to be an integration because you are fighting for talent with the likes of Google and Amazon as well as other agencies.\" He believes the only sure way to retain talent is to have a \"university setting\" where staff are allowed to \"change and grow\".</p> <p>He also believes that not only the agency but also clients, including some of the world's biggest including Nike, Getty Images and Nokia, need to realise that technology is changing they way they should look at their consumers and their own processes. This is one reason why R/GA started an in-house consulting practice because clients often come with a business problem as opposed to a communications brief.</p> <p>The company has also added data visualisation as a service for clients that moves beyond more traditional data analytics. The company's work for Nike in creating Fuel Band \u2013 wrist bands that track and synch personal data with the Nike+ community \u2013 is symbolic of the kind of thing all brands need to think about, he explains. \"The next step we see for all brands is where the consumer is in the centre of an ecosystem of branded experiences that are relevant and delivered through products and services,\" says Greenberg.</p> <p>Along with the growth of digital, mobile and social media, Greenberg believes physical spaces are the next big opportunity. R/GA has already started to implement projects with clients like Nike and O2 in the UK that bring people together and offer them rewards like the <a href=\"http://www.o2priority.co.uk/moments\">O2 Priority Moments campaign</a>. \"We are going to see the merger of information and personalised information,\" explains Greenberg. \"You can imagine once you get a community of interest built and you have the technology to know where people are with GPS that there are opportunities to not just send stuff to people hit or miss.\"</p> <p>Retail spaces also need to be re-imagined for a digital world, he says. \"Apple did it with the Apple stores, but the man in charge of that for Apple moved to JC Penny's and he hasn't been successful there yet. So it's not an easy thing to repeat,\" he concedes.</p> <p>Greenberg is a big Steve Jobs fan and one of the things he believes made Jobs \u2013 who was also dyslexic \u2013 into a great innovator was that he made sure to keep things simple. \"Jobs continues to surprise me with the things developed on his watch that are coming out even now, all around how important the reductionist idea is. It has to be really simple \u2013 and that also ties in with my thoughts about agencies and what they do with planning and insight. It has to be really simple because that is what really connects.\"</p> <p><em>Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator \u2013 follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/katecomments\" title=\"\"><em>@katecomments</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> to the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The under-representation of women in peace deals is symptomatic of a much wider risk to humankind: namely, from the gross power disparities between women and men throughout both industrialised and developing societies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/20/harmony-women-peace-deals?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Women are creating harmony, but only men broker peace deals, 28 September)</a>.</p> <p>In a male-dominated world it is not generally recognised that women are more broadly intelligent, less bellicose, more skilled in conciliation and more caring than men, with a greater concern for the survival and wellbeing of children. Demographic research has demonstrated that the best correlation with increased life expectancy and smaller families in developing countries is female literacy in primary schools, leading to the best hope for stabilising global population.</p> <p>The UN security council has manifestly failed in its 2000 resolution to allow equal participation for women in \"the maintenance and promotion of sustainable peace\". Stability, sanity and sustainability for our unstable world might be restored if the UN resolution were urgently implemented and some of the obscenely wasted resources that are devoted to military hardware were siphoned off to establish universal education and health services. Perhaps the next director general of the UN should be a woman?</p> <p><strong>Bryan Furnass</strong></p> <p>Canberra, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 On reading your item on female peace-brokers, I couldn't help but think that the whole report somehow misses the point. Yes, I certainly believe that women make better peace-brokers than men but is it really the peace-brokers who broker peace? Or is it not more often the case that peace comes when the power-brokers or the power-holders decide that a state of war no longer serves their needs?</p> <p>For example, neither women nor men can negotiate with a drone that is being guided in to take out some \"evil-doer\" in a remote Afghan village. But once the US decides that Afghanistan and Pakistan have been pacified enough to let the interested parties move their central Asian oil and gas through that country, then some figure will \"magically\" broker a peace ... which at the end of the day only happens because the powers-that-be decree so.</p> <p>And furthermore is war not sometimes the correct path to take? Imagine that you are an African fisherman from Somalia and your agriculture minister has sold off fishing rights to the EU and parked that money in his account in Z\u00fcrich: surely in this case it is your duty to go to war and to fight off the foreign trawlers? The tragedy here is that this normally leads to the disintegration of law and order in your country, a situation that is often helped along by international powers targeting your country with sanctions and the like.</p> <p>It is not very relevant to analyse who are the best peace-brokers. It would be better to remove the cause of war, that is all too often thinly veiled commercial interest.</p> <p><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong></p> <p>Cologne, Germany</p> <p>\u2022 Thank you for your lifegiving thoughts on women as peacemakers. Three years ago my son and a colleague visited Afghanistan to research a policy document on the conflict; they conducted interviews across the cultural spectrum, from tribal leaders to Nato.</p> <p>Yet not a single woman was consulted. While I honoured the courage and intent of their journey, it still seemed to be ultimately a discourse by, with, about and for patriarchy. How could the same segregated, gendered consciousness \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 that had created such chaos and anguish even begin to resolve the nightmare?</p> <p>Your article has transformed my disquieted maternal mutterings into a shout, dares me to dream out loud of the day when the restoration, keeping and making of peace replaces the lie of war as our central cultural narrative.</p> <p><strong>Annie March</strong></p> <p>West Hobart, Tasmania, Australia</p> <p><strong>Inequality is the problem</strong></p> <p>I wonder why journalists continue to tie the economy to living conditions in their countries: \"millions of families will struggle ... to raise their incomes\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/22/living-standards-report-divided-britain?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Living standards report shows bleak future of a divided Britain, 28 September)</a>. Wilkinson and Pickett have documented in The Spirit Level that there is little correlation between living conditions and the economic wealth of developed countries. There is almost complete correlation between inequality of income and health and social conditions. For example, Portugal and the US are at opposite ends of the economic wealth spectrum, almost identical in inequality of income and in an index of health and social problems. Sweden and Japan have low inequality of income and the least health and social problems.</p> <p>Thus the creation of more jobs and increasing the wealth of the country will not result in better living conditions. Two-income families becoming one-income families will provide jobs for unemployed people and with that, lower welfare costs and lower income inequality. Quit work and improve living conditions. Heresy I hear? The data is there.</p> <p><strong>Art Campbell</strong></p> <p>Ottawa, Canada</p> <p><strong>The limits of speech</strong></p> <p>Regarding Free speech: who sets the limits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/16/conservatives-democrats-free-speech-muslims?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(21 September)</a>: if free speech has to be curtailed to protect the feelings of the followers of various religions, I would like to demand similar protection for the numerous people like me whose views are mainly based on reason and scientific evidence. In particular, I take offence at people who publicly cast doubt on the theory of evolution or the fact that man-made climate change is happening.</p> <p><strong>Egbert von Steuber</strong></p> <p>Lingen, Germany</p> <p>\u2022 I find your comment on freedom of speech a bit puzzling. What is so important about speech? What about freedom of attitude, say extreme antisemitism, or freedom of behaviour, for that matter? Admittedly curbing speech would present problems but so would not doing so. Is it that those in the word business are a little precious about speech?</p> <p><strong>Ken Bragan</strong></p> <p>Wanaka, New Zealand</p> <p><strong>Put our house in order</strong></p> <p>The uproar over an abusive little film can only be explained by real injury to Arabs and Muslims, not just in a promiscuous war on terrorism but over centuries of colonial occupation, economic exploitation and political corruption <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/violent-protests-blowback-us-intervention\" title=\"\">(Surprise is that there aren't more protests, 28 September)</a>. This theatre of cruelty is ongoing, most bitterly in Iraq and Afghanistan, drone strikes on Pakistan and annexation of Jerusalem. Symbolic insults are blown up by media and fall as salt in open wounds.</p> <p>If we look to an Arab spring or moderate Islam for balanced responses or transformation from within, the best we can do is put our own houses in order and make amends where our help is most widely sought. A good starting point would be respect of international law and human rights in Palestine.</p> <p><strong>Greg Wilkinson</strong></p> <p>Swansea, UK</p> <p><strong>The wife of Jesus?</strong></p> <p>Tom Holland's article on the newly found Gospel of Jesus's Wife was refreshingly sane, compared to recent comments in some of the media <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2012/sep/19/jesus-wife-christianity-authorised-history\" title=\"\">(Jesus's wife adds fresh perspective, 28 September)</a>. He is so right to say this fourth-century document sheds no light on the historical Jesus, for the Jesus of the first century was not married to Mary Magdalene.</p> <p>When he was on the cross, four women gazed up at him: his mother, Mary; his aunt; Mary, the wife of Clopas; and Mary Magdalene. However, almost the last words he said committed his mother Mary into the care of the one male disciple standing there. If he had been married to Mary Magdalene, his first duty would have been to her, not to his mother, and he would have committed Mary Magdalene into that disciple's care.</p> <p><strong>Michael Penny</strong></p> <p>Reading, UK</p> <p><strong>Improving democracy</strong></p> <p>The two leaders in your 21 September issue imply that our politicians are failing us <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/17/climate-change-arctic-melts-editorial\" title=\"\">(All that is solid melts into water</a>;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/14/netherlands-election-editorial\" title=\"\"> Fool's gold</a>). And they are. Unfortunately people believe that you have to have them in charge and that they have to be elected. This is incorrect.</p> <p>If we adopt sortition \u2013 appointing representatives by random selection from the citizenship \u2013 then we obviate politicians and dispense with elections. This is not just an alternative way of selecting our representative but a more democratic way \u2013 which 2,500 years ago the Athenians recognised \u2013 realising that voting isn't a feature of a democracy but one of an oligarchy \u2013 which it is.</p> <p>Regrettably, many people don't even know what sortition is.

  "<p>Justine Greening, the UK international development secretary, has promised to tighten oversight of Britain's \u00a37.6bn aid budget as she defended development spending as the \"right and smart thing\" to do.</p> <p>Speaking at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Greening, who took over from Andrew Mitchell a month ago, sought to make the case that it is very much in Britain's interests for countries to be stable and secure, and that they had the potential to become markets once they develop.</p> <p>\"It is in all our interests for countries around the world to be stable and secure, to have educated and healthy populations, and to have growing economies,\" Greening told the sparse audience, citing the example of Kenya. She pointed out that UK trade with Kenya was \u00a31bn last year but could be so much higher as the African country develops.</p> <p>The coalition government has ringfenced the Department for International Development's (DfID) budget, which has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/26/the-politics-uk-aid-explained\" title=\"\">not pleased many Tories</a> who believe DfID should not have special treatment when other government departments are suffering budget cuts.</p> <p>Greening, however, said it was right that Britain will meet the long-standing UN target that rich countries spend 0.7% of gross national income on aid. The development secretary pitched the argument for aid at an emotional and intellectual level.</p> <p>Just back from a trip to Kenya, Greening said it was impossible not to look at the wasted potential of those trapped in poverty, at how \"many Steve Jobs\" are lost in the \"lottery of life\". Aid, she added, mattered, especially for women, who struggled for an equal voice in many societies. Money, she said, is making a real difference as it \"is next to impossible to escape poverty if you are suffering from illness and disease\".</p> <p>Greening said she wanted to build on the work of Mitchell, who ordered a review of all multilateral aid programmes and an assessment of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/19/uk-aid-programme-better-value-audit\" title=\"\">effectiveness of 43 aid organisations that received UK money</a>, and one on bilateral aid. The review led to a cut in core funding to four organisations.</p> <p>Greening, a former accountant, said she had introduced financial controls, whereby she would have to sign off on aid projects worth more than \u00a35m, instead of ones coming in at \u00a340m. Greening, who promised to continue Mitchell's \"value for money approach\", has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/17/dfid-spending-consultants-scrutiny\" title=\"\">ordered a review of how much the department spends on consultants</a>. This follows media reports that DfID spent almost \u00a3500m in 2010-11 on consultants, mostly British, some of whom earn six or seven-figure incomes and used to work in government.</p> <p>Greening said it was right for DfID to end aid to China and Russia as the department focused on countries less able to help themselves. As countries become richer, the UK needed to move the relationship beyond aid to trade, said Greening, adding that she planned to have discussions with India on their trading ties.</p> <p>\"As countries develop, they become bigger markets. Look at China and India \u2013 we exported nearly \u00a315bn to them last year,\" she said. \"If you talk to Jaguar Land Rover, whose fastest growing export market is China, they'll tell you how important this is because it creates jobs and investment here in the UK.\"</p> <p>She criticised the EU for giving aid to less poor countries and said she would be meeting European development officials next week to make sure the EU targeted aid where it could have the greatest impact. It was not right, she said, for the EU to provide aid for countries \"higher up the income scale\". Pointing out that 18 countries had \"graduated\" from least developed country status, Greening said this showed that development aid was working.</p> <p>Anti-poverty campaigners welcomed Greening's commitment to the 0.7% aid target and her statements on EU aid. \"EU aid is increasingly focusing on the poorest people and countries,\" said Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director of the advocacy group ONE. \"Governments of China, Brazil and India will no longer receive development aid from the EU from 2014. The EU's development co-operation instrument is reducing from 48 to 29 the number of countries it will spend aid in. It is now vital that the UK wins the argument for protecting the \u20ac51bn of EU aid focused on the world's poorest people.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, ONE released a <a href=\"http://www.one.org/international/blog/?p=9777\" title=\"\">poll</a> showing 61% of UK adults agree with next year's planned increased spending on overseas aid. Two in five (41%) think the government's plan to spend 1.6p in every pound of government spending on international aid is about right, and one in five (20%) think this rate is too low. Only a third of people (34%) think it is too high.</p>",

  "<p>\"Some people want to tell you the Conservatives have abandoned their green pledges, but nothing could be further from the truth,\" the climate minister, Greg Barker, told his party conference in Birmingham on Tuesday. He repeated the denial several times, protesting a little too much. The only spontaneous applause from the sparse audience during the energy and environment session on the main stage was in favour of killing badgers.</p> <p>Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/oct/05/badger-cull-tb-cattle\" title=\"\">has been uncompromising on the imminent badger cull</a>, aimed at curbing TB in cattle. He even laid claim to the policy as his own: \"I started this policy in opposition.\" The person who introduced him went even further, giving his work on fisheries credit as the \"intellectual underpinning\" for Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall's <a href=\"http://www.fishfight.net/\" title=\"\">Fish Fight</a>, though I'm not sure anyone has told Hugh.</p> <p>Paterson exudes confidence and felt sufficiently at home at the NFU's reception on Monday night to deride opposition to the badger cull as \"sad sentimentality.\" Moments before, a woman from <a href=\"http://www.bluebadger.org/\" title=\"\">Blue Badger</a> - Conservatives against the cull - had been forcibly told by a farmer that she needed re-education. Today, Paterson, who never misses an opportunity to mention the two pet badgers he kept as a child, described Labour's previous \"inaction\" as \"cowardly\", forgetting the mention it was their decade-long trial that is being used to justify the whole thing.</p> <p>But he also said something rather more revealing: \"We will start culling in two pilot areas to prove that it can bear down on the disease.\" I thought the government said its cull proposals were already science led, not a theory requiring proof. In any case, the pilots are only testing whether free shooting is humane, not whether the cull cuts TB.</p> <p>Paterson is generally calm and collected but almost leapt out of his chair with excitement after a question on shale gas at this morning's session. \"We issue the permits for drilling and there are half a dozen or so needed. We want to make that as simple as possible. The Environment Agency, who issue the licences, are setting up a one-stop-shop for companies.\" Combined with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shale-gas-tax\" title=\"\">George Osborne's \"generous\" tax breaks for fracking, announced on Monday</a>, shale gas is the only beneficiary from any new policy at this conference: some may see that as telling.</p> <p>But the new energy minister, John Hayes, has defied his early billing as a windfarm hating sceptic. He accepted the need to cut emissions, talked about the Climate Change Act being \"the context is which all [energy policy] fits\" and said he would demand more action on cutting energy demand. He also talked sensibly about shale gas being very early stage and emphasised the different geology and geography in the UK, compared to the US where several decade of development has delivered a gas bonanza. That is smart, given than no one outside the fracking lobby thinks shale gas is going to transform the UK's energy supply and send prices plummeting. Even some informed Tories I spoke to dismissed the idea as \"nonsense\", noting that not one of BP, Shell, British Gas or Texaco are interested.</p> <p>Hayes also repeatedly talked about the urgent <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn12_105/pn12_105.aspx\" title=\"\">need to get communities onside with renewable energy</a>, ensuring they have a say on siting and most crucially benefits for their local area. Barker also emphasised the desire to drive the rollout of community energy: \" I want to see the big six challenged by the big 60,000.\" Again, this is smart, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jun/04/wind-farm-power-opposition\" title=\"\">as I have argued before</a>. Barker described the Tory approach as cost-effective action to meet green goals, characterising Labour's approach as \"dogmatic and hair shirt\".</p> <p>Despite the siren calls of shale gas luring the climate sceptics in the Tory party on to the rocks, a senior source has told me that David Cameron is now personally re-engaging with the green agenda. There will be a meeting of the all-powerful coalition quad - Cameron, Osborne, Clegg, Alexander - in the next week or so. \"The PM wants to bring the Treasury and Decc onto the same page,\" I was told. \"The Treasury has to sign up to the renewable energy agenda, while Decc has to reassure on costs.\" The prompt for Cameron's renewed interest is unsurprising - the strong economic growth being seen in the green economy, which employs a million people, more than teaching. I was told the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">CBI's report on the green economy this summer was influential</a>, which it should be given the disastrous state of the UK economy overall.</p> <p>A renewed push by Cameron would be a welcome development, even if long overdue and only driven by his desperation for growth. Getting Osborne's thinking into the 21st century is the vital step. But, with Cameron's poor record since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">pledging a few days after becoming PM that he would lead the \"greenest government ever\"</a>, people will believe things have changed when they see it.</p>",
  "<p>London's largest initial public offering of the year has been launched, with Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov's mobile operator MegaFon confirming it intends to float before Christmas.</p> <p>Usmanov \u2013 who is Russia's richest man, according to Forbes, and the second largest shareholder in Arsenal football club \u2013 is not selling any of his MegaFon holding in the float but has already enjoyed a multimillion-dollar payday this year. He was one of the early investors in Facebook and sold shares in its record $16bn IPO in May.</p> <p>Usmanov took control of MegaFon in April, buying out fellow tycoon Mikhail Fridman through his company AF Telecom. Sources close to the float estimate it could raise $2bn (\u00a31.25bn), making it the biggest in London since Glencore's $10bn debut in May last year.</p> <p>Russia's No 2 mobile network by revenues and subscribers is expected to sell 15-20% of its shares, resulting in a partial exit for its other remaining shareholder, Sweden's TeliaSonera.</p> <p>The first of the big three Russian networks to offer 4G mobile internet connections, MegaFon said on Tuesday it expected to float its ordinary shares on the Micex exchange in Moscow and global depositary receipts on the London stock exchange \"in the fourth quarter of 2012\".</p> <p>Pre-roadshow meetings with potential investors are understood to be starting this week, with Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB leading the banking advisory team, and Citi, Credit Suisse and VTB Capital joining them as bookrunners. The new capital would be used to repay or finance existing debt and continue the expansion of the network.</p> <p>\"This is the right time for our IPO, which will support a new stage in MegaFon's development,\" the company's chief executive, Ivan Tavrin, said. \"We are now positioned to exploit the further growth potential of Russia's mobile market as it transitions from voice to high-value data services.\"</p> <p>Having invested heavily in 3G services, and with its 4G signal now available in 40 Russian cities, MegaFon has been at the forefront of the smartphone revolution and now controls more data revenues, which are generated by customers using the internet on their handsets, than any other operator.</p> <p>MegaFon's revenues totalled just under \u00a35bn in 2011, and have been growing at more than 15% annually for the last three years. It has 62 million subscribers and a 27% market share, according to AC&amp;M, which places it behind MTS (70 million customers) and ahead of Vimpelcom (56 million).</p> <p>In September, MegaFon asked the Russian markets regulator to allow it to list 123.38m shares, or 19.9% of the total, although more recent press reports have suggested the sale could be reduced to a 15% stake. If 15% of the shares are sold for \u00a31.25bn, the float would imply an overall valuation of \u00a38.3bn.</p> <p>Analyst James Britton, at Nomura bank, estimates that MegaFon's enterprise value \u2013 which includes equity and debt \u2013 is around \u00a311bn, equal to around 5.5 times the underlying earnings.

It features people from Haiti reading <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/%23firstworldproblems\" title=\"\">#firstworldproblems</a> tweets, and also responding to them. In one advert, a sweet little boy complains \"I hate it when my leather seats aren't heated\", before the camera pans out to show him sitting on a mound of rubble. In another, we see a laptop with the tweet \"Slow internet is the worst thing that can happen to you\", before being taken on a journey to Port-au-Prince, where a local medic in a disordered clinic connotes the vast suffering he has seen with the simple line, \"Slow internet is <em>not</em> the worst thing that can happen to you\". DDB says it will send the Haitian responses back to the original tweeters, encouraging reflection on third world realities.</p> <p>There has been some backlash against the campaign. Critics point out that DDB seems to have missed the screaming irony at play when tweeters use the offending hashtag. Labelling your minor woe a #firstworldproblem is, for many people, like saying, \"I'm a spoilt spanner for whingeing about this, but ...\" When DDB <a href=\"http://www.ddb.com/ddblogs/creativity/ddb-new-york-puts-firstworldpr.html\" title=\"\">describes #firstworldproblems</a> as a platform that \"showcases concerns that seem important to those living in wealthy, industrialised countries yet are, in fact, trivial,\" it leaves itself open to comparisons with the numbskulls that think some of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/sep/28/iran-fars-reports-onion-article-ahmadinejad\" title=\"\">Onion's stories are real</a>. And when each of the adverts closes with the statement #FirstWorldProblems are not problems, it's hard to refrain from channelling <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/cher-horowitz\" title=\"\">Cher</a> from Clueless and snorting, \"well, like, duh\".</p> <p>On the other hand, there's definitely an extent to which the hashtag is in bad taste. It might have started out as a rebuke to first world privilege, but it has now become so naturalised that it doesn't really encourage any sort of empathetic engagement with third world issues. Worse, it's formulated in a way that excludes people from developing countries from the conversation. It addresses an in-group assumed to \"get\" the petty grievances of prosperity. Irony aside, it's hard to ignore the fact that the #firstworldproblems gag rests on the discrepancy between first and third world quality of life.</p> <p>Nigerian-American polymath <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teju_Cole\" title=\"\">Teju Cole has a beef</a> with the condescending nature of #firstworldproblems. People in the third world, he points out, also deal with mundane hassles such as Blackberry connectivity issues or car repairs. He says: \"All the silly stuff of life doesn't disappear just because you're black and live in a poorer country.\" Similarly, all the serious stuff in life doesn't disappear just because you're white and live in an affluent country. You don't see tweets like \"I have a chronically ill child and no health insurance\" under #firstworldproblems, but these situations exist. I'm not euphorically proclaiming that we all live in a global village where national boundaries don't demarcate sites of privilege, but first and third world experiences are not incomprehensibly alien to each other; there is potential for meaningful dialogue about inequality based on mutual comprehension and humanity.</p> <p>This is what's powerful about DDB's campaign. It has the potential to harness the awesome force of the cybersphere and create an interface between people from different geographic and socio-economic situations. However, perhaps worried about invasive uses of social media, DDB wussed out. As <a href=\"http://frontand.de/why-ddb-and-water-is-life-missed-a-great-opportunity-with-their-firstworldproblems-campaign/\" title=\"\">this Sherlock Holmes-alike blogger convincingly shows</a>, the tweets used in the campaign aren't real. Also, the responses of the Haitians are clearly scripted, and the western lens deployed throughout the adverts is problematic. The locals were chosen (mostly from an orphanage) for their ability to communicate the worst possible standard of living, and the meaning of the twitter meme, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/ddbs-matt-eastwood-is-behind-the-haitians-reading-firstworldproblems-video-2012-10\" title=\"\">it seems</a>, wasn't really explained to them. The scripted nature of both the US tweets and the Haitian responses is deeply unsatisfying.</p> <p>When the smoke and mirrors of slick advertising are taken away, we are no closer to knowing what Haitians really think of #firstworldproblems. We're no closer to knowing how Americans really react to a personalised message from a Haitian person in response to a throwaway 140 characters. Instead of using the campaign to facilitate a conversation, DDB's campaign focuses on division and difference; thus, it inspires pity, not empathy. To quote Cole once more, \"Here's a first world problem: the inability to see that others are as fully complex and as keen on technology and pleasure as you are.\"</p> <p>Social media offers the opportunity for us to interact, one-to-one, with people from realities we had only dubiously imagined before, for these people to challenge our assumptions, and for us to change. DDB's affecting campaign might have fallen just short of tapping this potential, but it has broken new ground, and I am hopeful that others will deliver.</p>",
  "<p>We are probably far enough into the mutuals agenda to make a few observations about how it's playing out. Half-time into the coalition \u2013 two and a half years in \u2013 we are now seeing a number of thoughtful contributions from both supporters and sceptics.</p> <p>However, people from all sides of the debate tend to agree about three big things.</p> <p>The first concerns pace. What all agree on is that the mutuals agenda is proceeding at a slower rate than was envisaged at the beginning of the coalition. Back then the talk was of \"millions\" of public sector workers stepping out into new mutuals. But we're now talking about tens of thousands at best and there have been about 50 new mutuals in the last year. In truth, we're still in early-adopter stage. &#xa0;</p> <p>The second fairly universal agreement is that the mutuals agenda is far too complicated for many in public services to readily take on. The lack of a clear legal pathway to set up public sector mutuals is a massive constraint. &#xa0;</p> <p>There is neither enabling legislation \u2013 the equivalent of an <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2010-12/academieshl.html\" title=\"\">Academies Act</a> \u2013 nor a simple route-map through the complexities of legal form or EU-compliant procurement. Compared to setting up public sector trading companies, mutualisation far more difficult.</p> <p>The third area of consensus is that the mutuals agenda doesn't fit very clearly into an overall story about what the coalition is seeking to do with public services. On the one hand, there is a clear commitment on \"diversity of supply\", as set out in the <a href=\"http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">open public services white paper</a>. On the other, there is little commitment at to any degree of market-making on the part of the government to ensure that mutuals are established in a procurement environment in which they could not initially hope to win.</p> <p>So, what would a half-time pep talk recommend for the rest of this parliament?</p> <p>There are two approaches \u2013 one ideal, the other firmly grounded in political reality. The ideal would be an aggressive approach, the equivalent of an academies bill, which would give any public service a legal right to set up as an independent corporation, rather in the way that schools can step out of local authority control. Such entities would work under contract for three to five years before being market-tested. &#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p>Alongside this, a new legal form \u2013 the public service mutual \u2013 would be created, which could be a clear brand that could trade freely and end all of those constipated conversations about legal form that confuse and deter public bodies from moving forward. &#xa0;</p> <p>Finally, the coalition should say something about mutualisation being a preferred vehicle for public service divestment. This happened in Suffolk council and encouraged lots of staff to come forward with proposals. If we are to see more mutuals, a return to the pioneering language of 2010 is needed from the Cabinet Office and beyond.</p> <p>So far, so idealistic. What, in more workaday terms, do we need from the rest of the coalition's term? I would actually settle for the following three things: &#xa0;</p> <p>First, the consolidation of all capital funds for mutuals into a single pot which is then augmented by both <a href=\"http://www.bigsocietycapital.com/\" title=\"\">Big Society Capital</a> and private funds. This could then be split into start-up grants and longer-term funds to develop these companies. &#xa0; &#xa0;</p> <p>Second, I would simplify the <a href=\"http://mutuals.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Mutuals Support Service</a>. We are hearing that people find it too complicated and over-engineered. As a result, everything is taking too long. As a result, only a handful of grants have been made.&#xa0;I have changed my mind on this, I admit. I had thought that funds would be better centralised to save money and ensure knowledge-sharing. But civil servants based in Whitehall are not the best people to buy advisory services for new mutuals in Minehead or Manchester. &#xa0;</p> <p>Third and finally, the agenda needs a political shot-in-the-arm from the prime minister. People on the ground need to know the government is still on their side if they are doing this. People wonder if mutuals are still on the coalition's radar or if instead they have gone the way of 'big society' or other Steve Hilton ideas \u2013 all subsumed by larger economic concerns.</p> <p>Even without legislation, large amounts of public money or a clear political direction, the mutuals agenda is doing surprisingly well, happening on a small but impressive scale. As we run out for the second half, we remain in the game. But success is still far from assured.</p> <p><em>Craig Dearden-Phillips is managing director of </em><a href=\"http://stepping-out.biz/\" title=\"\"><em>Stepping Out Ltd</em></a><em>, a social enterprise which helps public services to become social enterprises.

  "<p>\"Turkey has fantastic golf courses. The problem with Turkey is that nobody there plays golf.\"</p> <p>Those were the words of Chubby Chandler, the man charged with overseeing the running of this week's inaugural Turkish Airlines World Golf Finals, at its official launch three weeks ago. Colin Montgomerie and Nick Faldo are among those who have given their name to courses in Antalya, an area which has already had some success in coaxing tourists from traditional golfing destinations in Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>Turkey's current appetite for golf, though, stretches beyond a desire to see their own population play more of it.</p> <p>The country has a dream to host the Olympics in 2020, an aim it hopes will be boosted by the handling of events such as the World Golf Finals, which start on Tuesday. If nothing else, this week will serve as a profile-raising exercise.</p> <p>Turkish Airlines have duly sponsored the flights and accommodation in Antalya for selected global journalists \u2013 this one included \u2013 in order to maximise coverage. The sponsors, at least, are serious about what detractors would label merely a golfing exhibition.</p> <p>The Ryder Cup scenes in Medinah have boosted this tournament's allure. Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy, Lee Westwood, Justin Rose, Webb Simpson and Matt Kuchar will make their first competitive appearances since playing at the most memorable Ryder Cup in living memory. Hunter Mahan and Charl Schwartzel, a former Masters champion, complete the eight-man field.</p> <p>Those competing in Turkey will do so in an unusual professional format. The field has been split into two groups of four, playing matches against each other in an 18-hole strokeplay format; two will progress from each section to semi-finals, with the final scheduled for Friday morning.</p> <p>Finance, of course, is a pivotal component of the World Golf Finals. When Westwood, Rose and Simpson spoke at the tournament's launch, they were honest enough to admit lucrative reward played a part in their willingness to come here. By securing the appearances of McIlroy and Woods \u2013 images of the duo adorn every billboard promoting the event \u2013 the sponsors have the blue-chip players they wanted. Intrigue now surrounds how Antalya will respond.</p> <p>The organisers have placed Woods in the same group as McIlroy to ensure a showdown match on Wednesday afternoon. As if to highlight how security conscious Turkey now is, those in charge are thought to have raised an eyebrow that Woods sought \"only\" four bodyguards at every public juncture of his maiden stay.</p> <p>Turkish Airways turned to Chandler and made their multi-million pound budget plain after drawing an initially cool response from the European Tour. The World Finals are not yet sanctioned by the tour.</p> <p>On top of six-figure appearance fees for certain members of the field, the winner will receive $1.5m (\u00a3940,000), with the player finishing last still collecting $300,000. Chandler is adamant the tournament will expand over the next four years, a matter which could prove invaluable to Turkey's Olympic dream.</p> <p>The appearance of European Tour officials and referees, plus the fact the Turkish competition comes in the same week as the sanctioned Portuguese Open, hints at further funds being bestowed on the tour to offset inconvenience. The United States' PGA Tour is not thought to be quite as amused by the placement of the finals on the same week as the Frys.com Open in California.</p> <p>Yet the initial suggestions are, just as the format of this tournament is far from set in stone, there is flexibility within the schedule. The appearance of a Turkish Open in the 2013 European Tour calendar must be linked in some way to the coming days in Antalya.</p> <p>There will be scepticism from those who object to players being coaxed towards events simply by hard cash. Still, in this economic climate and with tournaments disappearing from the golfing schedule \u2013 last month, the Andaluc\u00eda Masters became the latest to fall by the wayside \u2013 those governing the game must be flexible. Or, in short, grab hold of what rich ventures they can. If nothing else, the World Golf Finals represent fresh money being poured into golf.</p> <p>The success of this event, then, could be of longer-term benefit to the European Tour. There is absolutely no question it would prove likewise to Turkey.</p> <p><em>Ewan Murray travelled to Antalya courtesy of Turkish Airlines, which is sponsoring the World Golf Final</em></p>",
  "<p>It's a decade and a half since OK Computer catapulted Radiohead to global superstardom. They've now been one of the biggest bands in the world for so long that it's easy to forget how curious and unique their situation is: in a world where rock and pop is not much given to overestimating its audience, here is a band whose music long ago abandoned any pretentions to commerciality capable of filling out the kind of venues where Rihanna or Coldplay normally ply their trade.</p> <p>Anyone requiring a reminder of the incongruity of Radiohead's position needs only to step inside the O2's arena. Jauntily yellow-jacketed stewards are flogging soft toys, emblazoned with the words VAMPIRES SUCK MY BLOOD in gothic script. In one of the O2's numerous chain restaurants, menus announce that it's Radiohead Night; quite how the dread-filled, agitated sound found on their last album, King Of Limbs, squares with bourbon-glazed baby back ribs and the Cajun spiced chicken sandwich remains open to question, but you can't blame them for trying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397433605\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/9/1349781936723/Thom-Yorke-of-Radiohead-001.jpg\" alt=\"Thom Yorke of Radiohead\" width=\"220\" height=\"219\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thom Yorke: 'weirdly magnetic'. Photograph: Samir Hussein</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's always the chance that fans turn up in their thousands in the dementedly optimistic belief that Radiohead are going to roll out the 1990s hits, in which case, they must go home tonight sorely disappointed, with only a version of OK Computer's Karma Police to remind them of the band's earlier, less complicated incarnation. As if to underline how far leftfield Radiohead have subsequently shifted, it's followed by the instrumental Feral, which in its live incarnation \u2013 scattered rhythms overlaid with echoing vocal loops and waves of electronic noise \u2013 is arguably the most abstruse and uncommercial piece of music you're ever likely to hear booming around an arena venue.</p> <p>But the audience doesn't sound particularly disappointed at being presented with a set of material that draws most heavily on last year's King Of Limbs. \"Are you lost yet?\" asks Thom Yorke at one juncture, but they don't appear to be at all. In fact, they appear to be rapt: there's something arresting about the fact that hardly anyone seems to be filming proceedings on their mobile phones, which makes it a fairly remarkable event in the annals of modern-day gig-going.</p> <p>You can see why people are paying attention. On a prosaic level, it's a visually spectacular show, the stage bathed in vivid colours, a dozen video screens suspended above the band, shifting and changing positions with each song. During 15 Step, they turn horizontally, forming a low ceiling of light above the musicians: it's a simple idea, but an incredibly striking effect, seeming to shrink the size of the stage, creating a weird sense of intimacy in the least intimate venue in London.</p> <p>Moreover, Radiohead sound fantastic. Songs that passed in a blur on record sound tough and potent onstage, not least Bloom, transformed into an audacious clatter of percussion: adept at absorbing influences from dance music and electronica without being submerged beneath Radiohead's default rhythmic setting now seems to be a writhing take on funk syncopation. You're struck by their ability to shift their sound completely between songs \u2013 from the crushing bass-heavy riff of Myxamatosis to These Are My Twisted Words's spindly, thin, cyclical guitars to the unsettling electronic abstraction of The Gloaming.</p> <p>Thom Yorke, meanwhile, is as idiosyncratic in his approach to holding a vast audience as the rest of the band. His hair scraped back into a pony tail, he appears to be following the advice of that terrible little poem about dancing as if no one is watching you: lost in his own world, there's something weirdly magnetic about him. Accepted wisdom suggests that kind of thing shouldn't work but it does. Then again, accepted wisdom suggests Radiohead shouldn't be here at all: that they should have alienated their mass audience long ago. Accepted wisdom is clearly wrong. A state of affairs it's hard not be delighted by.</p>",

  "<p>Viewed from one angle, parenthood can feel like a long series of mis-steps, self-reproach and faltering recovery; my own parenting motto is \"fail again, fail better\", which gives you some idea of how much fun it is in my house. The new <a href=\"http://www.4children.org.uk/Resources/Detail/Over-the-Limit\" title=\"\">4Children report</a> considering British parents' drinking habits lands squarely in this tender spot of parental guilt, asserting that a significant (although unspecified) proportion of us have a more problematic relationship with alcohol than we are prepared to acknowledge.</p> <p>Teetotallers and recovering alcoholics aside, I suspect that few parents make it through the toddler (or teenage) years without making a brittle joke about <a href=\"http://www.mumsnet.com/Talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/1238873-My-wine-o-clock-is-5-o-clock-aibu/AllOnOnePage\" title=\"\">wine o'clock</a> while scrabbling for the fridge; but so long as our intake remains within squinting distance of the guidelines, we tend not to think too deeply about whether our drinking is having a serious impact on our parenting. Those who find themselves not merely opening, but actually finishing bottles on a daily basis may creep closer to a queasy state of concern.</p> <p>The 4Children report is a stern reminder that our habits are not necessarily benign, and sketches an uncompromising line between alcohol use and neglectful or abusive parenting. According to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2762991/pdf/1471-2458-9-377.pdf\" title=\"\">a National Psychiatric Morbidity Survey from 2000</a>, 22% (2.6 million) of under-16s lived with a hazardous drinker and 6% (705,000) with a dependent drinker; and children who fall into those groups are also more likely to be affected by domestic violence and child abuse.</p> <p>Recalling nothing so much as the non-drinking friend at a heavy pub session, 4Children remarks caustically that \"self-awareness, or the lack of it, enshrouds the issue\". Those seeking certainties, unit recommendations and appropriate cocktail recipes will, however, be disappointed. There appears to be no definite point at which taking-the-edge-off tips over into danger territory \u2013 the main message of the report is: whatever you're currently drinking, drink less. As such, it risks veering into the world of slightly infantilising advice with which women become familiar the instant they report their pregnancy to a GP.</p> <p>The pages are studded with painful box quotes from children who recall seeing their parents stashing bottles in cupboards or failing to get up in the morning. For anyone whose alcohol use is less evidently problematic, this is actually curiously (and presumably unintentionally) reassuring. One question that seems to go unanswered is: if your intake is within guidelines, your children don't see you drunk, and you are providing a safe and predictable environment for them, do you really have any kind of problem at all?</p> <p>Perhaps it's inevitable when dealing with the enormous variety contained within entire populations, but there's a lack of subtlety in much public health advice handed out to pregnant and post-natal women, and it can be counter-productive. Recent attempts to persuade expectant mothers to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/29/health.medicineandhealth\" title=\"\">stop drinking entirely</a> \u2013 despite a lack of evidence that a few units a week cause any appreciable harm \u2013 risked a loss of trust.</p> <p>A fairly cursory survey of recent Mumsnet threads on the topic reveals a range of responses: those who don't drink at all; those who drink very occasionally, or remain within guidelines; those who drink more than the recommended amount, but don't feel it's problematic; and those who know that they have the beginnings of a \"problem\", or who are in recovery. My guess is that 4Children is targeting an audience somewhere around the third category; drinking (objectively speaking) \"too much\", but resistant to advice. While the report is an interesting contribution, and will certainly prompt some self-reflection among many parents reading it, an acknowledgement of differing levels of intake and dependency might persuade us to listen more closely to the messages it contains.</p>",
  "<p>Ending deforestation has been a political goal for decades, even centuries \u2013 an unmet ambition up there with finding world peace and eradicating global hunger. The challenge has received increased attention in the past five years because of climate change and the fact that forests keep massive stores of carbon away from the atmosphere.</p> <p>The UN-backed scheme known as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks), could see relatively large payments made to keep that carbon in the forests. As a consequence, a significant part of international forestry efforts has recently been focused on this one objective. Using forests to offset human-induced climate change is an admirable aim, and it is likely that other forestry objectives, such as conserving biological diversity, would benefit from this as well. But this focus has become almost myopic. We must not neglect the greater potential of forestry to contribute to questions of economic and human development.</p> <p>Forestry is not an isolated sector disconnected from the world beyond the trees. For local people, the forest is a source of renewable energy, food and livelihoods. Results released last year from a six-year study by the <a href=\"http://www.cifor.org/\" title=\"\">Center for International Forestry Research</a>, show that forest income, on average, constitutes more than one-fifth of total household income for people living in or near forests. This includes wood for fuel and construction, bushmeat, edible and medicinal plants. Forest products also contribute significantly to global business and trade; wood and non-wood forest products constitute 4% of global trade in commodities. Forests also provide environmental services that are critical for sustaining life, such as biodiversity and of course climate regulation through carbon storage. While REDD+ has helped raise awareness about this latter service, there is surprisingly limited debate around the ways in which the combined benefits of forestry add up to make a weighty contribution to global sustainable development solutions.</p> <p>Conservation of forests is often seen to be in opposition to economic development. However, conservation, land use and development are unequivocally linked and by combining them rather than pitting them against each other, we can build comprehensive solutions rather than 'either-or' scenarios.</p> <p>Food security is one area where the conservation and human development agendas have been framed as opponents. Clearly, without food security for all, we cannot claim any success in sustainable development. The plight of one billion undernourished people around the world is a huge moral and developmental dilemma that must be addressed. To do this successfully however, we must review the perception that food security mainly requires the production of more food. Instead, we must understand that food insecurity exists largely because of poverty, lack of access to food and inadequate nutrition. Food security is therefore not achieved just by producing more calories off the land.</p> <p>This is important to the role of forestry in several ways. First, policies that stimulate agricultural expansion (ie deforestation) should not do so in the name of food security. Second, forestry, including agroforestry, provides opportunities for more diversity in food and hence better nutrition. Third, income from forestry products and services can reduce poverty, one of the underlying factors of food insecurity. And we need better recognition of the role forestry plays in providing energy for cooking for hundreds of millions of people, an often-overlooked dimension of food security.</p> <p>If we avoid the false dichotomy between forestry and food security, we will find that these differing sustainability objectives can actually support each other. Similarly, moving towards healthy and resilient landscapes, reduced environmental impact from agriculture, and improved marketing opportunities for land-based products are all parts of the same sustainability equation. Forestry's contribution can be scaled up through improved practises. While such solutions need to be specific to local circumstances, I see three key needs at a general level:</p> <p>\u2022 Fair, affordable and accessible private finance that promotes sustainable land use, particularly for rural smallholders, is needed. We expect that schemes such as REDD+ will increase or stimulate investments in sustainable land use, but rural finance needs also must be addressed more broadly.</p> <p>\u2022 Food policies should recognise the value that forestry brings to the table. Food and nutrition security depend on a variety of factors where forestry is key \u2013 both for nutrition, renewable energy and the resilience of landscapes.</p> <p>\u2022 It must be recognised that ambitious and targeted global forest-related initiatives such as REDD+ can leverage broader benefits, and should therefore be seen as integral parts of rural development efforts, rather than conservation projects.</p> <p>Forestry has too often been defined in terms of what it can stop rather than what it can create. As long as we continue to measure the contributions of forests solely against the benchmarks of ending deforestation and limiting climate change, we will be blind to the much wider benefits that forestry can bring to sustainable development. It is time for forestry to come out of the forest.</p> <p><em>Peter Holmgren is director general for the </em><a href=\"http://www.cifor.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Center for International Forestry Research</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Sustainability is becoming increasingly central to the growth strategies of some large multinational companies, but such businesses remain in the minority. However, there are signs of positive change with a proliferation of pilots and innovative sustainability programmes in the area of resource and energy efficiency especially. Underpinning this progress is growing goodwill and collaboration across all sectors to work together towards sustainability.</p> <p>However, the global footprint of human activity continues to expand. Moreover, with many economies struggling to emerge from recession, the growth imperative often appears to counteract sustainability goals. Alongside this, the wave of emerging market industrialisation does not naturally support the pursuit of a more sustainable path - in many cases it does the exact opposite.</p> <p>So are governments, business and civil society doing enough and are they realistic in their perception of progress? In terms of climate change, the scientific community would certainly say no. But if the question is whether we are approaching the tipping point for mass consumption of sustainable products and services, the jury is out.</p> <p>Why is this so? Certainly the lack of political momentum since Copenhagen is not helping. There is an absence of a global framework, a lack of common regulatory rules and carbon pricing initiatives are relatively weak, although there is clear acceleration of these in Australia and Korea. Rio+20 may have attracted 1,600 companies compared to only 16 two decades ago, but feedback from this year's earth summit was mixed. As Pascal Lamy, director general at the World Trade Organisation, <a href=\"http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl239_e.htm\" title=\"\">noted</a>, the economic crisis has caused a retreat from international agreements and a return to domestic agendas.</p> <p>The innovation cycle is also part of the challenge. As was the case with the internet, the first years of technological revolution often deliver little, with hype exceeding reality. The economic slowdown has further hindered the volume-based economic paradigm, holding back the testing and implementation of new business and operating models at scale.</p> <h2>What will it take to reach a tipping point?</h2> <p>How do we turn good intentions and initial actions into scalable programmes that can transform business strategy, operational models, resource management, and energy consumption?</p> <p>In Accenture's <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/Pages/insight-long-term-growth-short-term-differentiation-profits.aspx\" title=\"\">2012 research</a>, which asked 250 leading executives their views on sustainability, it was evident that business had turned a corner. More than three out of four leaders (78%) now believe sustainability plays a \"vital\" role in the future growth of their businesses, while 83% see expenditure on sustainability as an investment, rather than as an additional cost burden.</p> <p>And we don't have to go too far to find sectors that have got close to a tipping point. In most markets, utilities are actively rebalancing their portfolio away from coal with a clear emphasis on both gas and renewables. Consider best practice examples such as Iberdrola and, at a geographic level, China's efforts to implement major initiatives to test and use all alternative energy sources at scale. So while coal plants still proliferate to meet demand, we also see an accelerated commitment to alternative technologies. For instance, it is widely accepted that carbon capture and storage will take off in China first rather than Europe. Meanwhile, the smart grid movement is taking off at high speed in many parts of the world, both developed and emerging economies, aiming to rebalance energy supply and demand.</p> <p>In the automotive industry, which for the most part has long ignored sustainability, 2008 was a turning point. Whether it's the revived US sector or other efforts to accelerate advances in electric cars and alternative fuels, automotive shows nowadays seem to almost exclusively display electric and hybrid propulsion with a clear focus on carbon efficiency.</p> <p>There are also shifts in the consumer goods sector with a revolution being led by prominent leaders, from Paul Polman's <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/\" title=\"\">Sustainable Living</a> programme at Unilever, the <a href=\"http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose.html\" title=\"\">Performance with Purpose</a> signature of Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo or the <a href=\"http://www.nestle.com/CSV/Pages/Homepage.aspx\" title=\"\">Shared Value</a> ambition of Nestle. And then there are the redefined strategies and growth prospects of industrial companies instrumental to wider transformation such as Philips, Siemens, GE, Schneider Electric, JCI and their portfolio of lower carbon solutions for lighting, heating, cooling and motoring which support the vision of a more sustainable lifestyle.</p> <p>From a geographic perspective, discrete but emerging pressure is coming from the coalition of the energy starved 'BICS' (Brazil, India, China, South Africa). In time, these countries will become a driving force, reshaping the sustainability agenda and international summits.</p> <p>The point is this. In a complex world in which the power of western politics and international summitry are questioned, a more fragmented kaleidoscope of efforts is being fashioned. Consumer power and resource scarcity are setting clear guidelines and a more commercial approach to sustainability is being adopted.</p> <p>In a globalised marketplace, sustainability is being seen as an opportunity for growth. So if we have not turned the corner yet and the picture is still troubled, at least we are inching our way closer from summit to summit, with business increasingly leading the required transformation.</p> <p><em>Bruno Berthon is global managing director at Accenture Sustainability Services.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>UN experts have called for a $20bn global fund to promote the creation of social safety nets for the most vulnerable people in poor countries.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_182200/lang--en/index.htm\" title=\"\">International Labour Organisation</a> (ILO) estimates the costs of universal social protection to be 2-6% of gross domestic product. As the total GDP of the world's poorest 48 countries is about $1tn, a safety net would cost $60bn if using the 6% figure. The developing countries would be expected to contribute two-thirds, leaving $20bn to be financed by rich countries.</p> <p>The fund would have two functions: to help the 48 least developed countries (LDCs) put in place a \"social protection floor\"; and to serve as a reinsurance provider to step in if a state's social protection system was overwhelmed by an unexpected event such as extreme drought or flooding.</p> <p>According to the ILO, 75-80% of the world's population does not have access to \"comprehensive social security\" protection to cushion the effects of unemployment, illness, disability, crop failure or soaring food costs. In times of crisis, families in poor countries typically remove their children from school or sell assets such as land or animals, which can weaken their ability to cope with future shocks.</p> <p>While acknowledging that the idea of may meet resistance in hard economic times \u2013 Britain is cutting back social protection \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Food/Pages/FoodIndex.aspx\" title=\"\">Olivier De Schutter</a>, the UN special rapporteur for food, said a global fund would save money in the long run.</p> <p>\"This is an investment, not a handout,\" he said. \"If we invest in supporting the poor against the risks of illness, unemployment and disease, it is one way of allowing markets to expand and make use of their multiplier effect. Acting preventively is much less expensive than intervention on an ad hoc basis. It costs eight times more to act in famine. By having safety nets in place, it will not be so necessary to intervene at an emergency stage.\"</p> <p>De Schutter will argue for a global fund for social protection in Rome next week at a session of the committee on world food security (CFS), which brings together governments, UN bodies, NGOs and the private sector. De Schutter and <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Poverty/Pages/SRExtremePovertyIndex.aspx\" title=\"\">Magdalena Sep\u00falveda</a>, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, are behind the proposal.</p> <p>In a briefing paper, they cited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2010/nov/19/brazil-cash-transfer-scheme\" title=\"\">the <em>Bolsa Familia</em> in Brazil</a> and the child support grant in South Africa as successful social protection schemes. Both initiatives provide cash transfers to poor families, and both have reduced child poverty and hunger. In member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, poverty rates are estimated to be \"approximately half of those that might be expected in the absence of such social protection provisions\".</p> <p>Under the rapporteurs' proposal, countries would be asked to adopt social protection systems, or reform existing ones, to ensure everyone \u2013 including those in the informal economy \u2013 has access to social protection. To win support from the fund, countries would have to design and operate schemes in line with social protection as an internationally recognised human right.</p> <p>The fund would rely on poorer states to devote their maximum available resources to social protection schemes. The gap between this amount and what is needed to finance these systems would be made up by the fund using donations from richer countries.</p> <p>De Schutter said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/05/africa-mineral-wealth-poverty-world-bank?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">developing countries such as Cameroon could make better deals with investors</a> interested in land deals to generate funds for social protection schemes. \"There is huge potential now that land is a scarce asset and such revenues could be put to good use,\" he said. \"There is pressure from the CFS to impose more transparency in these transactions so that developing countries can get better terms.\"</p> <p>The scheme could be a formal fund through which richer countries make donations that are then redistributed to poor countries, or a new independent body, or it could sit within an existing institution such as the World Bank.</p> <p>The global fund's reinsurance arm \u2013 put at about $3bn (using a high insurance rate) \u2013 would facilitate reinsurance coverage for social protection schemes in countries where risks (and the fear of excess demand for support) make it difficult for states to obtain affordable and extensive reinsurance. In the case of a shock, such as drought or food price rises, the reinsurance arm could step in to provide temporary support.</p> <p>\"International support for social protection measures becomes even more relevant in the context of the global economic crisis and its severe impact on the LDCs,\" said the rapporteurs. \"International solidarity is needed. When the global financial crisis struck, governments stepped in to prop up banks that were deemed too important to fail. The same logic must now be applied to basic social protection, which is too crucial to be denied.\"</p> <p>Calls to achieve a social protection floor in all countries \u2013 whereby at least minimum levels of income security and access to healthcare are provided to all \u2013 were supported by an overwhelming majority of delegates from the ILO's 185 member states in June. The World Bank lent $11.5bn between 2000-10 to support social protection in 83 countries.</p> <p>The UK's Department for International Development, which has implicitly endorsed the ILO's social protection floor, has been a pioneer in advocating and developing social protection and ranks second only to USAid in levels of bilateral donor support in this area.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was corrected on 9 October 2012. The original headline said $1bn.</p>",

  "<p>You didn't have to have tickets to Ghana fashion and design week (GFDW) to get a sense that something was afoot at Accra's most showy venue, the M\u00f6venpick hotel.</p> <p>In the lobby on the morning the event was meant to start (Ghana being Ghana, the 11am launch happened closer to 3pm), I saw something I have rarely seen around here before: skinny women. Not just the odd one \u2013 who of course exist in every country \u2013 but whole groups of them, moving together in small, conspiratorial-looking packs.</p> <p>\"Ah the models have arrived,\" an equally bemused woman sitting near me pointed out. \"They look like aliens, don't they, 6ft tall, all arms and legs, with waists the size of one of my thighs?\"</p> <p>I wouldn't describe them quite like that, but this observer \u2013 a typically curvy older woman \u2013 captured a reality; that in Ghana, sightings of skinny women are extremely rare. Models don't look like ordinary women \u2013 if they did then they wouldn't, by definition, be fashion models. And the debate about how different their bodies are from the ordinary is nothing new.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LKnLxyYW6_A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"330\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LKnLxyYW6_A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But in Ghana not only do women not look like models, but they have no desire to look like them. This is a country where pharmacists freely disclose that buoyant sales of appetite stimulants are mainly owing to women who want to, as Ghanaians put it, \"grow fat\". Across west Africa, large busts and behinds, and thick legs are highly prized assets. As the legendary <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5USwWBtwceI\" title=\"\">Fela Kuti sang in Army Arrangement</a>, \"yansh na wonderful material perfect\" (\"arse is a wonderful thing\").</p> <p>Watch any music video by the growing number of west African artists who are crossing over into the mainstream with hits like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpkOOrbPg48\" title=\"\">Sound Sultan's Pass Me</a> and you will find ample evidence that the Afrobeat pioneer's commentary is as timeless as ever.</p> <p>It's not just that booty is considered beautiful. There are also taboos surrounding skinniness in west Africa, where a lack of body fat is associated with poverty and Aids. A friend who moved to Ghana from Europe told me that when she was breastfeeding her child, people regularly expressed surprise that her \"tiny breasts\" were capable of producing milk. Girls are still told that if they want to find a husband and bear children \u2013 which most do \u2013 they will need to fill out a bit.</p> <p>The spread of the western fashion industry, and its increasing convergence with Africa's own long-standing and vibrant fashion culture means all this is changing. I remember the furore in 2001 when Nigeria finally became the first African country to win Miss World because it entered Agbani Darego \u2013 a tall, skinny, 18-year-old with non-typical features who <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/03/world/lagos-journal-globalization-of-beauty-makes-slimness-trendy.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\" title=\"\">was not considered particularly attractive at home</a>. Her victory had a huge impact on the model industry in west Africa, where skinny girls suddenly realised that what had seemed like a hindrance was now an asset.</p> <p>And as African fashion weeks, such as GFDW and the increasingly high-profile Arise event in Nigeria, gain traction with the global fashion industry, it is inevitable that they will begin conforming more to those standards. Some of the collections at GFDW, which finishes on Tuesday, were beautiful. Duaba Serwa combined on-trend, A-line silhouettes, Lurex silver, and textured layers with very Ghanaian textile prints.</p> <p>The more accessible these designers become to a global market, the sooner Africans will be able to profit from their own talent, rather than watching European and American firms exploit their traditions without leaving a trace of benefit.</p> <p>There is probably an argument \u2013 which I don't accept \u2013 that African designers have to present their clothes on the same skinny bodies as designers everywhere. And, yes, you can change the models, but you can't change the customers. I've never been to a fashion week before, but at New York and London I'm always reading about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/sep/22/london-fashion-week-lauren-laverne\" title=\"\">lettuce leaf lunches and people who don't eat</a>. All I can say is that the jollof rice and fried chicken was disappearing at the usual rate at lunch at the M\u00f6venpick; and at the cupcake and champagne reception, I saw hardly anyone drinking champagne, but the cupcakes were gone in a flash.</p> <p>Thankfully the prospect of Ghanaians thinking that models are meant to fill them with self-loathing, seems a long way off.</p>",
  "<p>The great historian Lewis Mumford once described a patent as \"a device that enables one man to claim special financial rewards for being the last link in the complicated social process that produced the invention\". He was pointing out that we do not produce inventions <em>ex nihilo</em>, but rather draw on the totality of the inventions and knowledge that came before us.</p> <p>It is no longer just the fruits of a centuries-long social process that are targets of patent claims. Through genetic engineering, corporations can now create and patent new life forms. Physicist Vandana Shiva, in a video launching the global <a href=\"http://seedfreedom.in/\" title=\"\">Seed Freedom Campaign</a>, calls this ownership of entire new species a form of slavery, and calls upon farmers and consumers to fight the privatisation of the genetic commons.</p> <p>Could it be that she is being naive? Facing the spectre of world hunger amid continued population growth, maybe we will have to let go of our sentimental attachment to traditional farmers saving seeds, and transition to high-tech agriculture so that we can improve yields per hectare. After all, we cannot clear much more cropland at the expense of forests and wetlands. And to finance the enormous long-term investment necessary to engineer high-yielding, drought-resistant, pest-resistant varieties, don't we need to enforce a strong system of patents?</p> <p>This position seems reasonable, but it is fraught with assumptions that collapse under close scrutiny. First and foremost is the notion that we need chemical pesticides, herbicides and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to feed the hungry. Surely each new innovation brings higher crop yields, right? Surely yields are higher when you kill the bugs than when you don't, higher when you use improved strains than when you don't?</p> <p>Not really. Holding all other variables constant, certainly a large wheat field will produce more if it is treated with chemical herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. But organic agriculture, and especially permaculture and traditional peasant agriculture, don't hold variables constant at all. Each farming culture adapts over time to the unique characteristics of the local soil, biome and climate. Farmer and land co-evolve over generations. <a href=\"http://www.rodaleinstitute.org/files/GreenRevUP.pdf\" title=\"\">Numerous studies</a> show that when organic agriculture is practised well, it can bring double or triple the yields of conventional techniques. With intensive intercropping on mixed permaculture farms, yields can be <a href=\"http://www.whale.to/a/blume.html\" title=\"\">higher still</a>. It is a myth that mechanised, chemical, GMO agriculture maximises yield per hectare.</p> <p>What it does maximise is productivity per unit of labour, which is a good thing if we uphold American-style economic development as a model for the rest of the world. Taking the essential parameters of large-scale mechanised agriculture as a given, those who argue that we need genetic engineering \u2013 and therefore GMO patenting \u2013 to feed the world's hungry are right. However, these parameters encode assumptions that we are beginning to recognise as diastrous.</p> <p>Western-style agriculture faces a mounting crisis that is insurmountable through the usual application of more control-based technology. Aquifer depletion, salinisation, soil erosion and soil compaction reveal our system as unsustainable. Meanwhile, each technological solution generates unanticipated new problems; for example, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/02/us-usa-study-pesticides-idUSBRE89100X20121002\" title=\"\">herbicide and pesticide resistance</a> (superweeds and superbugs) mean that more technology is needed even to keep yields from declining. GMOs seem to generate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/28/study-gm-maize-cancer\" title=\"\">unpredictable health dangers</a>. And commodifying agricultural inputs like GM seeds and the pesticides and herbicides they are designed to accompany disrupts rural labour reciprocity, promotes indebtedness and creates dependence on volatile international commodity prices.</p> <p>This crisis calls us toward more ecological farming methods that draw from the world's ancient agricultural traditions. These traditions include not only agronomic knowledge, but also social structures that allow that knowledge to evolve and circulate. Today, instead we have an intellectual property system that encourages innovation, yes, but only a certain kind of innovation \u2013 the kind that leads to greater profits.</p> <p>What is the alternative? The ancient practice of seed saving and seed sharing, which allows plants, land, and culture to co-evolve organically, is being revived by organisations like the <a href=\"http://seedsavers.org/\" title=\"\">Seed Savers Exchange</a>. The Seed Freedom movement seeks to preserve this practice, which comes under assault whenever new regulations are proposed to require registration of all seeds to protect the intellectual property rights of patent holders.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, innovative permaculture practices have spread like wildfire, and none of them are patented, made artificially scarce and then sold. Instead they are copied, shared and adapted to local conditions \u2013 much the same way that genes spread through species and life forms spread around the globe.</p> <p>In ecology, each species contributes to the wellbeing of all life and benefits from the wellbeing of all life. Now humanity is rejoining that circle. The next great agricultural transformation will not be an intensification of technologies of extraction and control; it will be an ecological agriculture that regenerates soil, aquifers and biodiversity. Traditional agricultural societies where farmers still save and share seeds are much closer to the ideal of ecological agriculture than the western model. Rather than imposing our technology on the rest of the world, perhaps it is us who can learn from them.</p>",

The move shows the new justice secretary, Chris Grayling, is abandoning the legacy of his predecessor, Kenneth Clarke.</p> <p>It emerged in a separate interview that Cameron had himself been burgled twice while living in north Kensington, London.</p> <p>Asked if he would be \"a fight or a flight\" person, Cameron told Sky: \"I think you never know what is going to happen in those circumstances and I'm not advising people to have a go, but the fact is people need the certainty that if they were in that situation and they did have to take action to defend themselves then the law is on their side.\"</p> <p>Cameron denied his party was \"turning right\" to grab back the \"one nation\" mantle appropriated by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, in his party conference speech last week.</p> <p>\"The Labour party cannot be a one nation party because, if you read or listen to Ed Miliband's speech, he was, of course, signalling he was turning to the right but actually in everything he said he was turning to the left \u2013 a tax on wealth creation, a tax on business, a tax on success.</p> <p>\"You can't preach one nation and practise class war.</p> <p>\"I think everybody sees that. The common ground of British politics right now is answering the question on everybody's lips \u2013 how do we take action to get Britain out of the difficulties we are in today?\"</p> <p>He added: \"The Conservative party is doing what I would say all of the country would want to see, which is to unlock the talent of everyone to make sure we win in this global race. That's not leftwing or rightwing, it's sensible common ground, common sense, practical Conservative thinking.\"</p> <p>The prime minister was celebrating his 46th birthday as delegates prepared to gather for the third day of their party conference, with the London mayor, Boris Johnson, taking top billing when he gives a keynote speech on Tuesday morning. His star is firmly in the ascendancy amid widespread speculation that he may pursue the party leadership further down the line.</p> <p>Asked what Johnson could get him for his birthday, Cameron said: \"He's giving me a relatively light day, which is good of him. The point is, we are lucky in the Conservative party to have some big and popular figures to take the message out across the country as well as having someone who is a first class mayor of London.\"</p> <p>Asked if Johnson might be sent abroad following his time as mayor, the prime minister quipped: \"I'm not sure which country deserves him the most but I will take that one away and think about it.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ask an outsider what they think of Castlemilk and they'll probably say alcoholism, poverty and poor housing. The estate, on Glasgow's southern edge, has been ranked among Scotland's most deprived places.</p> <p>But in recent years the area has gained a reputation for something altogether more glamorous: film stars.</p> <p>Directors Ken Loach and Peter Mullan have cast residents in critically-acclaimed films including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2002/oct/04/artsfeatures4\">Sweet Sixteen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/03/angels-share-ken-loach-review\">The Angels' Share</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jan/20/neds-review\">NEDS</a>, and local talent regularly appears in television productions such as Rab C. Nesbitt, Taggart and soap opera River City.</p> <p>Castlemilk stars like <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0566089/\">Stephen McCole</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1162048/\">William Ruane</a> and binman-turned-actor Gary Maitland have appeared in major productions and caught the attention of industry figures in Hollywood and Cannes.</p> <p>And now another local performer is hoping to follow in their footsteps.</p> <p>Martin Docherty's stage career began at the age of 10 when he was roped in to play the Artful Dodger in his sister's drama group's production of Oliver. </p> <p>After years juggling acting roles with bar work and call centre jobs, he recently won his biggest to date with a small but credited role alongside Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in the forthcoming film Cloud Atlas \u2013 a mooted blockbuster shot partly in central Glasgow, to emulate San Francisco.</p> <p>Friends had expected him to fly to LA to walk the red carpet at the film's premiere: Docherty told them he couldn't afford to go.</p> <blockquote> <p>With these big productions the big A-list stars go to the premiere as a way to promote the film. Everyone else is welcome to attend, but you have to pay your own way.</p> <p>I know a lot of Scottish actors have been in the same boat, and I was just pleased to have gotten the part.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>But while Martin was content with just that, two friends took things further. They started an online campaign to raise money to take him to Los Angeles for the film's premiere - <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/martygoestohollywood\">Marty goes to Hollywood</a>, with his campaign backed by Glasgow's lord provost, Sadie Docherty. </p> <p>While their crowd-funding effort to make a documentary of the trip failed to get off the ground, anonymous donors paid for his five to seven-day long trip to California.</p> <blockquote> <p>They're really secretive about the premiere, they won't announce the date or the location until a few days beforehand, but they've told us the week that we should be in town.</p> <p>We've also got some great meetings lined up with people like Gerard Butler and Kevin McKidd \u2013 Scottish actors who have really made things work out in the US.</p> </blockquote> <p>Developed in the 1950s and 60s, Castlemilk was one of several new housing schemes intended to replace overcrowded slums such as Glasgow's notorious Gorbals. Its construction was immortalised by the documentary photographer <a href=\"http://www.oscarmarzaroli.com/home.html\">Oscar Marzaroli</a> in his image The Castlemilk Lads. But poor urban planning soon led to major social problems. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397444656\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349722165346/The-Castlemilk-Lads-002.jpg\" alt=\"The Castlemilk Lads\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oscar Marzaroli The Castlemilk Lads, 1963 Photograph: Anne Marzaroli/Scottish National Portrait Gallery</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Marzaroli/Scottish National Portrait Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The schemes, intended as residential zones for a car-owning commuter population that never materialised, featured grim concrete housing blocks and high-rise flats, but few workplaces and no community facilities.</p> <p>Regeneration programmes in the 1980s attempted to address some of these issues, but in 2006 the area was listed by the Scottish government as the country's third-poorest.</p> <p>While the estate is much improved since the 1980s, Martin reckons Castlemilk's rough edges might partially explain the volume of talent emerging from the area.</p> <blockquote> <p>I think maybe when you're from a less sheltered environment you find yourself in certain situations where you have to be quite confident.</p> <p>When I've been involved in drama in schools, sometimes in the posher areas you don't get a great response, but in less privileged ones they adore it.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Among Castlemilk's schools, St Margaret Mary Secondary has a particularly strong reputation for drama. Its pupils regularly appear on stage and in television productions.</p> <p>Fifteen-year-old Liam Forrester is one of the drama department's most successful current pupils and has been cast in plays, films and television programmes. His career began with the children's channel CBBC, to a role in Peter Mullan's Neds and a show reprising hits from musicals at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.</p> <p>Liam has also studied music and dance. He said that at times his peers had been less than completely understanding:</p> <blockquote> <p>I've taken some stick from my friends.</p> <p>They would be playing XBox or football and I'd be playing the piano or rehearsing, but that's died down since they started saying 'Oh, he's getting on stage, he's been on TV, he's getting paid.'</p> </blockquote> <p>Liam's classmate Monique Petrie has been involved with drama since she joined a local group aged five. Now planning to study psychology and sociology, she said that the lessons learned in school had been valuable on and off-stage.</p> <p>\"You get pushed to do your best, be confident and shine as much as possible to get where you want to be in life\", she said.</p> <p>Their teacher, Louise Clelland, echoes that sentiment. But she said that while drama could play an important part in a school's curriculum, some people could be dismissive of the subject:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the past it was seen as a namby-pamby subject, but we've fought hard to prove ourselves. In higher drama we study Greek tragedy, Shakespeare, Scottish contemporary theatre, they do essays, analysis, acting, directing. </p> <p>It's hardcore - one of the hardest Highers there is.</p> <p>When I first started teaching I was in the east end of Glasgow and only two schools had a drama department. Now that the authorities have caught on to how drama enhances the curriculum, people are finally saying 'I want drama in my school.'</p> </blockquote> <p>Clelland said incorporating drama had a knock-on effect on other aspects of school life: her pupils are taught basic skills other might take for granted: listening, communication and speaking clearly, investigating drugs, smoking and bullying through drama. She added:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes it's the real characters who do well at drama \u2013 kids who perhaps don't do as well in other subjects, but because they don't care what people say about them they excel in drama.</p> </blockquote> <p>St Margaret Mary's has recently joined with nearby Castlemilk High and Mamie's Weans, a highly regarded children's drama group, to work together on productions and organise theatre-going trips to London.</p> <p>They hope that the experience will encourage the next generation of Scottish actors to make the jump from Castlemilk to California.</p>",
  "<p>There is a wait-and-see approach among top officials the IMF. Wait and see what happens next in Europe and wait and see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics-blog/2012/oct/01/us-fiscal-cliff-credit-rating-downgrade\" title=\"\">how the US tackles its so-called fiscal cliff</a>.</p> <p>Optimists at the top of the organisation believe an agreement on closer co-operation and debt sharing in Europe, alongside a congressional deal in the US to limit the impact of tax rises and spending cuts due in January, is possible and will put the world economy back on a path to growth and recovery.</p> <p>Olivier Blanchard, the IMF's chief economist, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/08/imf-warns-global-crisis-eurozone\" title=\"\">singled out Europe</a> and the US for criticism during the annual conference in Tokyo, though as an optimist, he said there were signs that both were edging towards deals that would end the current uncertainty.</p> <p>The focus on Europe and the US is understandable. Despite talk of a globalised world, the crux of the dilemma faced by the Washington-based bank is that without growth in Europe and the US, every other country suffers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/08/world-bank-warns-on-china-slowdown\" title=\"\">China is the prime loser from a slowdown</a> in the west for the simple reason that it remains dependent on exports. While it has made efforts to develop a more rounded economy and bigger welfare state, Beijing depends on foreign buyers for its income.</p> <p>Yet the debts run up by Europe and the US since the financial crash leave them in a position where conventional wisdom says they must favour government spending cuts over measures to spur growth.</p> <p>The IMF is unrepentant in its view that governments cut public spending even though, for the worst hit nations like Britain, there is a direct impact on growth.</p> <p>Carlo Cottarelli, boss of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, was clear that anyone criticising the speed and depth of public spending cuts should consider the costs of not doing it, namely that international money markets would punish them with sky high borrowing costs.</p> <p>It is an argument we have heard many times. It is George Osborne's main defence when critics from the left accuse him of slowly sinking the economy under the weight of cuts that undermine confidence and private investment.</p> <p>But it is not one that rings true in the US or Japan, which have kept spending high and are still considered safe bets by the investor community.</p> <p>The UK has equally low borrowing costs. Is that because it also squeezes into the too-big-to-fail camp, or because it has pursued austerity?</p> <p>A quick look at the IMF's fiscal monitor shows the trade-offs between growth and deficit reduction have put the UK and US in roughly the same position as far as their annual spending deficits go.</p> <p>In the last two years, the US has grown consistently, but overspent more. The UK has not grown at all, but has cut further.</p> <p>The US is predicted to end 2012 with roughly the same annual deficit, but gets a bigger economy than it had two years ago, while the UK has shrunk. The US national income is greater than before the crash, the UK's remains 4% below the peak.</p> <p>So if a country can confront investors in a game of chicken and win, an expansionary policy makes sense. The benefits of higher tax revenues and lower unemployment costs help reduce deficits. Only anxious investors can spoil the party.</p> <p>The eurozone could pull off the same trick if countries could stick together. Two years ago there was an opportunity to follow the US. Hanging together would have kept borrowing costs low and allowed government to keep borrowing while private business recovered. There was general agreement except for Germany and a small cohort of right wing governments in Finland, Holland, and Austria.</p> <p>The IMF expects the eurozone to achieve the unity this year or next that it has failed to find in the last two. It cannot explain how, except to say that there appears to be more willingness to help each other.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Spain, Portugal and Greece, the northern eurozone members are the investor community. It is their banks that hold much southern European debt. They are the panickers.</p> <p>And only as long as the south is prepared to impoverish its people will they get solidarity. Setting aside the fact that this strange concept of solidarity is deeply flawed, mainly because it will take a huge amount of repression by Europe's elites to push it through, the IMF's optimism is based on Europe becoming, in the eyes of investors, too big to fail.</p> <p>So surely the IMF is in favour of battling the money markets to allow spending to increase?</p> <p>No, says Cottarelli, who was clear in his press conference that he could not think of any countries in a position to increase public spending.</p> <p>In answer to arguments put by economist Paul Krugman and others that cheap borrowing \u2013 because you are a country that is too big to fail \u2013 offers an opportunity to invest cheaply for future growth, he said the risk still existed that investors/lenders would panic at a later stage and jack up interest rates. So even if it is safe now, it may not be safe in a few years when total borrowing would be stratospheric and an increase in borrowing costs crippling.</p> <p>He said that for the US to borrow more would put the world economy on a knife edge.</p> <p>For the IMF to advocate that countries be scared of the markets is bizarre, when all that happens is that one country after another finds itself with such low growth that it needs a loan from the IMF.</p> <p>The US, the UK and most of the eurozone avoid this humiliation by printing money and devaluing their currencies. Yet even that is not enough and means all these vital economies will be borrowing more and IMF advice will exacerbate the problem.</p>",
  "<p>The numbers around how many people use social media are staggering \u2013 91% of global adults online use social media regularly. In the UK there are 41 million Facebook users and 10 million people on Twitter. As you're reading this article online, it means you'll probably check at least one social media site today. There is no denying the power of it, and it's changed the way we communicate.</p> <p>Despite how ubiquitous social media is, not everyone has figured out how to translate available online tools into offline goals. This includes charities and social enterprises, who, despite their interest and enthusiasm, may not be social media savvy just yet.</p> <p>In partnership with <a href=\"http://www.unity.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Unity Trust Bank</a>, <a href=\"http://www.socialmisfitsmedia.com/\" title=\"\">Social Misfits Media</a> have, this week, launched our plan to address that issue. About that First Tweet is a practical guide to social media, aimed at small to medium-sized charities and social enterprises and is free to download <a href=\"http://www.unity.co.uk/guide\" title=\"\">free to download here</a>.</p> <p>The guide features interviews from experts on the main social media platforms, inspirational case studies from organisations who have run successful social media campaigns, resources and other tools to help even the leanest organisations become Twitterphiles in no time at all.</p> <p>To ensure the guide was addressing the needs of the organisations we were seeking to support \u2013 UK-based charities and social enterprises with an annual turnover of less than \u00a35m \u2013 we conducted original research, surveying 186 such organisations on their social media habits, usage, and frustrations.</p> <p>Many of the results were surprising. For example, we originally conceived the guide as a tool to help organisations get started on social media. But our research actually showed that more than 70% of the organisations were already using Facebook, Twitter, or both. LinkedIn and YouTube were also popular, with more than a third of respondents having already created accounts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397422513\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/08/Social-media-chart-1.gif\" alt=\"Social media chart 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Once probed, we uncovered that although these organisations may already boast a social media presence, they're not always sure of what to do with it. When asked if they felt that their social media was integrated into not just a communications strategy, but a fundraising strategy, 53% responded that their social media strategy was not very integrated or not at all integrated. \"Our social media strategy and fundraising strategy are entirely separate,\" one respondent from a medium-sized charity told us. \"We haven't yet explored any ways to join them.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397422514\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/08/Social-media-chart-2.gif\" alt=\"Social media chart 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"621\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The other main issue reported by many respondents was the lack of time to devote to social media: 75% only receive occasional support to update their platforms, when someone has a bit of spare time (and how often does that actually happen in the third sector?).</p> <p>The guide takes all this on board and provides practical tips and strategies that organisations can start doing right now. A few of our favourite tips:</p> <p>\u2022 Don't feel you need to be everywhere at all times. Jaimie Popp, social media strategist at the <a href=\"http://nikeinc.com/pages/the-nike-foundation/\" title=\"\">Nike Foundation</a> who features in the case study on <a href=\"http://www.girleffect.org/learn/faq\" title=\"\">The Girl Effect</a>, recommends being selective with the platforms you choose: \"By starting with your audience, you can put your momentum where it needs to be,\" he says.</p> <p>\u2022 Let users help you create content. You don't need to post everything yourself. Libby Leffler, strategic partner manager at Facebook, recommends things like photo competitions and polls to get your followers to submit their own content; not only is it compelling but it saves you time too.</p> <p>\u2022 Start making friends. Meg Garlinghouse, head of social impact at LinkedIn, says their research has shown that people can begin to take advantage of their second and third degree networks once they have 30 LinkedIn connections.</p> <p>\u2022 Use your mobile. By downloading free apps for things like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn on your smart phone, you can post photos and information on the go.</p> <p>\u2022 Or better yet, get professionals to do it for free. The New York Public Library got a local improvised comedy group with a big YouTube following to act in a viral video for free \u2013 just by asking.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unity.co.uk/guide\" title=\"\">Download About that First Tweet</a> for many more insights and ideas.</p> <p><em>Carlos Miranda is the founder of </em><a href=\"http://www.socialmisfitsmedia.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Social Misfits Media</em></a><em>, a social media strategy firm and sister company of IG Advisors, a philanthropy and fundraising consultancy.

  "<p>After <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2012/oct/08/michael-page-recruitment-profit-warning\" title=\"\">Monday's disappointing update from Michael Page International</a>, fellow recruiter <strong>Hays</strong> has done better.</p> <p>The company's shares have jumped nearly 6% despite it reporting a 1% like for like fall in total net fees for the first quarter. The decline was better than analysts' expectations of a fall of around 4%.</p> <p>The global performance was mixed, with Germany the star, up 25%. But Asia Pacific fees fell by 9% and by a similar amount in the UK. Here, the private sector fell by 14% while the public sector took up some of the slack, growing by 10%. This does not seem to fit in with attempts by the coalition and chancellor George Osborne to chop back public sector spending. The banking and construction sectors were particularly hard hit, while in the public sector, growth was driven by \"job churn in the permanent business.\" On the outlook the company said:</p> <blockquote> While overall conditions remain challenging and some markets are very tough, opportunities for growth exist in many key parts of our business. <br> </blockquote> <p>Hays shares are up 4.4p to 79.6p, more than recovering Monday's Michael Page-related loss, and Investec issued a buy note. Analyst Sebastian Jantet said:</p> <blockquote> This [update] contrasts well with Michael Page's result yesterday. <br> Whilst we view Hays as less geared into a recovery, it is also less geared in a downturn and this isn't fully reflected in the current valuation, with the discount to peers looking too wide to us. We remain buyers, with our 90p target price unchanged. </blockquote> <p>Caroline de La Soujeole at Seymour Pierce moved from hold to buy, saying:</p> <blockquote> This is an encouraging update from Hays. Guidance is for a similar outturn in the second quarter of 202. It is still early days so we leave our 2013 forecasts unchanged, expecting adjusted pretax profit of \u00a3117.9m, down 4% year on year. Consensus is at \u00a3111m (range \u00a3103m- \u00a3126m). We believe Hays has a more resilient business model compared to Michael Page given its more balanced temp/perm exposure. </blockquote> <p>Overall, markets are edging lower as EU finance ministers meet to discuss the never-ending crisis, and ahead of the start of the US reporting season, with investors nervous about the effects of the global slowdown on corporate earnings. The IMF downgrade of economic growth has not helped matters either.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is currently down 15.15 points at 5826.59. Mining companies are moving higher on hopes of further moves by China to stimulate its economy, with <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rising 45.5p to \u00a330.30 after UBS raised its price target from \u00a346 to \u00a347 after a US site visit:</p> <blockquote> The tour highlighted one-off costs are masking true underlying performance. We retain our buy rating with Rio our preferred stock in UK diversified miners as it offers the greatest leverage to a recovery in commodity demand in China, which we expect to occur from the fourth quarter of 2012 as large infrastructure projects approved earlier in 2012 take hold. </blockquote> <p>Earlier, however, the mining group cut its growth forecast for China and said it planned further cost cutting.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Schroders</strong> has climbed 18p to \u00a315.50 after a positive note on the asset management firm from Morgan Stanley, which moved from underweight to equalweight:</p> <blockquote> We upgrade Schroders as product breadth in key allocation areas (e.g. multi-asset) and in geographical distribution, combined with reduced pressure in European retail, mean that our estimates are now marginally ahead of consensus. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Pennon</strong> has slipped 8p to 725.5p after the water company bought the wonderfully named Pulp Friction, a paper collection and processing business, for \u00a39m.</p>",
  "<p>There's a little piece of Yorkshire in the heart of Tokyo where a thirst for great British beer is getting stronger. The World Beer Museum in the city's Skytree Tower district stocks such liquid delicacies as Two Pints and Monkman's Slaughter. </p> <p>The company that makes them, The Great Yorkshire Brewery, was recently relaunched adding new lines created with overseas customers in mind. The deal with the Tokyo customer is the result of a decision to invest in the plant needed to supply a niche product to a far flung market.</p> <p>The Japanese company wanted an exclusive arrangement in the UK. The first step was to send samples for a taste test. A flurry of visits and paperwork followed and this year the Japanese customer placed its first order. No less than 1,000 kegs later, and the company's owner, Joanne Taylor, says: \"We love thinking of Japanese people sitting in a bar drinking Yorkshire beer.\"</p> <p>The clincher in winning the contract was the brewery's bold decision to make the major investment in equipment. A decision was made to outlay \u00a3100,000 for a kegging machine which allows the brewery to produce cask beer but export it in kegs.</p> <p>Taylor explains that cask beer is a 'live' product which is too unstable to travel. The beer degrades during any significant journey. The company is one of one of few small breweries that produce cask beer with the capacity to put it into kegs, which means it can consistently supply high quality craft beer to customers overseas. This commitment was crucial in prising open export markets so the company also invested tens of thousands of pounds in 1,000 stainless steel kegs, ensuring the product reaches Japan in optimum condition.</p> <p>The Great Yorkshire Brewing Company has set its sights on other export markets, starting with Ireland. Taylor is attending an event there organised by UKTI which gives British producers a chance to showcase their products.</p> <p>She and her business partner, Phil Lee, also spent time in the US with a master brewer in Michigan to learn what was needed to produce and sell beer attractive to American consumers \u2013 a vastly different market to that in the UK. \"Every state has its own local beers and every state has different rules on what you can say on the label and how alcohol is sold, so we looked at equipment and talked about recipes and learned as much about that market as we could.\"</p> <p>Armed with that knowledge, they are working on a new product. \"A US contact told us that the American palate is for big 'hoppy' beers and we started developing a lager that we think will export really well. It will be brewed as a lager, but with a big fruity flavour - unusual for a lager here.\"</p> <p>Perfecting the taste and honing logistics are essential to the export market, Taylor says, but giving the brand character is vital. The product's \"Yorkshire-ness\" is part of its appeal and the labelling and packaging are a clever nod to the brewery's heritage.</p> <p> \"We hope that by drawing attention to where the beer comes from, we will stand out in a global marketplace,\" Taylor says.</p> <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.thegreatyorkshirebrewery.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thegreatyorkshirebrewery.co.uk/</a></p> <p><strong>There are two more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>Leeds-based Publish Interactive is the brainchild of Daniel Lord. Seven years ago he was working as an analyst creating market research reports and selling them on to clients.</p> <p>Lord spotted a gap in the market when the company sent out their reports, as their clunky PDF format meant that end users couldn't do much with them.</p> <p>He taught himself to program and came up with the software which was the basis for Publish Interactive's current system.</p> <p>Emma Forber, commercial director, takes up the story. \"He came up with a web based platform that is interactive. So, the market research firm is our client. They license the software from us and then brand it as their own, integrating it as part of their sites. </p> <p>\"It means that all market research is then uploaded to their site and they give customers a log in so they can access it.</p> <p>The beauty is that it enables clients to save sections of content and search much more easily. They can filter by figures: if, for example, an executive wants to give a Powerpoint presentation it's now a simple matter to export data straight onto their own computer. With the previous system of PDFs they would have had to use screen shots and the whole process could take a day - now it takes less than a minute.</p> <p>Forber, who was one of the first people recruited by Lord to his startup, says that the company has used its innovative software to target the big market research companies based on the east coast of America.

For example, end users now include 24 out of 25 of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies and 17 out of 24 of the world's top financial organisations. </p> <p>The company is developing new ways to sell its products. \"A year to 18 months ago we began developing social networking tools which are also about sharing information,\" says Forber, speaking from the company's offices in the Round Foundry media centre in Leeds. \"For example, if someone in London is working on a project with someone based in the US and they are both logged on they could cut and filter content and share it with each other. It's all done in the same platform.\"</p> <p>As for the future, the company is planning to employ more developers as it seeks to take on new markets. Forber says: \"I can't say much about it but we are creating another application for the software but aimed at a different market.

  "<p>A strong brand identity is integral for success but creating a face for a company is especially difficult when its product is technical and the language needed to sell it is not easily accessible to a wider market. A British communications firm is opening global opportunities for technology companies \u2013 and forging its own strong export market in the meantime.</p> <p>Speaking from Paris, where his team were working on branding strategies with a startup company, Guy Redmill, the managing director of Redmill Marketing Associates, was keen to explain his company's language services which lends clarity about their role to the 'non technically-minded'. </p> <p>\"We offer business development help to first and second stage technology companies who want to sell into an international area,\" he said. \"Our game is making good companies attractive to international clients who need what they have to offer.\"</p> <p>Anyone who has been flummoxed by the jargon associated with website development and SEO will appreciate the role of a company who makes the message transparent. Imagine then, how a foreign company seeking an international market - whose personnel don't speak English as a first language - would be interested in Redmill's services.</p> <p>\"Our latest assignment is from a company in Brazil that wants to crack Europe. The language barrier is one thing we can help with in terms of marketing.</p> <p>\"Our USP is translating complex propositions and making them accessible. We have a very deep and intricate understanding of the IT industry and can leverage that knowledge for clients who want to move into an international arena. That gives us a strong value add when comparing us with most marketing companies.\"</p> <p>Inquiries from Malaysia, France and even Zanzibar are among those recently received via the company's online presence. Redmill says that when the business was in its infancy, most of its growth came from networking with past contacts and from referrals from impressed clients. The company's approach has become more sophisticated as it has expanded its export markets. The search for clients has been helped by taking part in industry conferences abroad and from significant investment in SEO performance to improve its visibility.</p> <p>Redmill said: \"SEO takes time to be effective, but we were able to build momentum on multiple fronts and that allowed for the lag in SEO performance. </p> <p>\"We are a small company but we have grown a lot. More than 50% of our business is now through exports, and the proportions have changed rapidly. It's very exciting.\"</p> <p>Its own success is perhaps the greatest illustration of the very benefits it wants to sell to foreign companies, Redmill explained. \"I would say that enhanced SEO performance has ultimately yielded the greatest return on investment, generating a steady flow of unsolicited inquiries.\"</p> <p>\"Our company is now exposed to more markets, which led directly to an estimated increase in turnover of around 60% in the last 12 months.\"<br>Tactics to emulate for any firm wanting to get itself known \u2013 and Redmill knows just who can help on that front.</p> <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.redmillcommunications.com/\">www.redmillcommunications.com</a></p> <p><em>There are two more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>Mark Proctor believes European Automation's (EA) speed and service has saved manufacturing businesses around the world hundreds of thousands of pounds in the three years since it was founded. </p> <p>\"The biggest threat to productivity is unscheduled downtime due to equipment failure,\" the managing director says. \"Even very short stoppages can incur six-figure costs.\" </p> <p>The supply chain specialist steps in to find and deliver spare parts to any manufacturers that use automation processes - from robots in a car factory to conveyor belts in a steel mill. This means sourcing components from the likes of Siemens and Mitsubishi and supplying them to customers in Europe, Scandinavia, North and South America and the Middle East. </p> <p>The company deals in parts that are new, used, refurbished and often obsolete. \"Someone might have a system that has a lifespan of 40 years, but after 10 years you can't get the spare parts anymore. Instead of refitting the whole facility with brand new machines, we prolong the life of the existing machine by offering parts that are no longer available,\" Proctor explains. </p> <p>The majority of EA's trade is with 80 countries - just over 16% of turnover is from the UK. To meet this demand, the HQ in Stafford employs 60 multilingual staff from 20 different countries. </p> <p>EA's global customers start by looking for the part on localised websites in their own language in Latin America, the Middle East, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the UK, the US and Australia, then call a local number that is routed to the UK and answered by a native speaker. </p> <p>\"The nature of our business is that our customers are in genuine need of a solution immediately, usually because their factory or facility has ground to a halt. We feel they need to speak to a human being as soon as possible, and they need a level of expertise and guidance from someone who speaks their own language,\" says Proctor.</p> <p>Several hundred thousand parts are stocked at EA's 7,000 sq ft distribution centre in Stoke, but in instances where it may be more cost-effective and fast, local partnerships overseas are engaged. The company can get parts to anywhere in Europe within nine hours and as quickly as 72 hours to Latin America.</p> <p>Traditionally, sales reps would travel between manufacturers and customers, but the internet has provided a gap in the market for EA. \"We saw the opportunity for someone like us where customers worldwide could get a very, very fast solution - particularly when it comes to end-of-life products. Our industry is changing and we're here to offer an alternative.\"</p> <p>EA has several competitors in the UK and overseas, but believes its strong branding as a \"one-stop solution for every automation problem\" is what sets it apart. \"Where we try and win is the strong emphasis on customer service, speed and rapid response.\"</p> <p>Proctor adds: \"We've got ambitious plans to grow worldwide in the next year and beyond. We've gone from having three members of staff to having 60 in just over three years and we have no plans on stopping there.\"</p> <p><strong>Website: </strong><a href=\"http://www.ukautomation.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ukautomation.co.uk/</a></p> <p><em>There are two more categories of our Best Practice Exchange competition to enter on a rolling basis - Cashflow and Starting Up.

  "<p>Manchester United, Real Madrid, Arsenal. The client list of Prozone Limited reads like a directory of world football. From a small business providing massage chairs to Derby County, it has transformed itself into a global operation with offices on five continents.</p> <p>Since its foundation in 1998, Prozone has become a byword for technical and tactical excellence in sport, especially in football where the company has its origins. But while it is often thought of as a collater and provider of data to teams \u2014 how many metres did a player run? How many passes did a player make? \u2014 business development director Blake Wooster is keen to challenge that idea of its work.</p> <p>\"It's a coaching product,\" he says. \"There is a misconception that it is just a technology business. But it is really a comment and analysis business. Very much an interpretative business. </p> <p>\"Other companies provide raw data but we offer a capability to extract insights for clubs. We are the Bloomberg of sports information. On the interpretative side we have coaches, sports scientists and psychologists working on it. There is a lot of expertise.\"</p> <p>As you might expect from a company based on analysing data, it is carefully targeting areas for growth as it looks beyond its core UK and European market. </p> <p>\"We are looking at where the most helpful opportunities are,\" says Wooster. \"Whereas once I would be the person to go and sort something out abroad, we now have full-time people in five continents. Local people with local knowledge. We've gone from a local business to a global operation.</p> <p>But it wasn't always quite like that. The spark for the Prozone idea came when then Derby manager Steve McClaren was trying to set up tactics videos for his players to watch while they had sessions in massage chairs. </p> <p>He happened to mention to the providers of the chairs that he wished there was some way of developing a system of video analysis which he could play for his players as they sat being massaged.</p> <p>Those providers went away and looked at tracking technology used in the military and built an analysis tool. Prozone was born.</p> <p>McClaren then took the idea to his next club, Manchester United, and soon all Premiership teams were on board. </p> <p>As Wooster says, it was built very organically. \"We don't have a sales team in the traditional sense. Steve McClaren valued the product so much that he took it to his next team. Then teams talked to each other and that was how it spread. So it happened to us rather than us doing it.\"</p> <p>\"Many clubs overseas look to the English Premier League for an example of best practice. Qatar, China and Japan have all come to us looking at ways to professionalise their football. They need to have this tool.\"</p> <p>As the nature of the business develops, so too does the client base. <br>Wooster says: \"We've worked in rugby and in Australian rules football with the AFL and there are other team sports which we can move into.

  "<p>While the mayor of London tries to get his affordable housing programme off the blocks, negotiations over the 2015 comprehensive spending review are already on the horizon. The outcome will determine whether the next mayoral term can be one of investment and prosperity, or austerity and cutbacks. Housing must be at the top of Boris Johnson's shopping list.</p> <p>His chief of staff told the London Assembly in July that the mayor would be going for \"investment money\" rather than \"revenue money\" in the next spending review. In the midst of a double-dip recession more damaging than the Great Depression, and at a time when the government is able to borrow money at exceptionally low interest rates, smart investment programmes are exactly what we need.</p> <p>London has enjoyed a reasonable decade of investment in transport infrastructure, right up to the \u00a315bn Crossrail project currently underway. Two successive mayors have missed no opportunity to call for greater investment in transport. Yet housing has fared less well.</p> <h2>Cuts to housing</h2> <p>Of all the damaging decisions taken in the 2010 comprehensive spending review, the most bizarre must surely have been to cut investment in London's affordable housing by 66%. The mayor has picked fights in the past \u2013 over funding for Crossrail, the future of Heathrow \u2013 but he simply rolled over on this one; he hailed the cut as \"a really good deal\".</p> <p>Johnson was apparently happy because the number of affordable homes being built each year will be largely unchanged. The circle is squared by charging higher rents, making tenants pay more towards the housing. But most social tenants can't afford the higher rents, so they will need to claim more in housing benefit.</p> <p>In effect, they will be paying for the homes out of future housing benefit budgets instead of today's affordable housing budget. This completely contradicts the approach described by the mayor's chief of staff, because the government and mayor are cutting investment today and will have to spend spend more in future years.</p> <p>Housing is the most urgent and damaging social crisis in London today. The cost of housing is also a major drag on the economy, making it difficult and expensive to hire young talent and manual workers due to the high rents they have to pay, and sucking money that might be spent in shops and on services into mortgage repayments and rents.</p> <h2>A bigger budget</h2> <p>The mayor's housing board, <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/moderngov/mgCommitteeDetails.aspx?ID=262\" title=\"\">Homes for London</a>, is due to discuss the 2015 comprehensive spending review during its meeting on 10 October. He must use this period to put down a marker against the kind of budget he needs to begin to resolve these problems.</p> <p>London's housing budget needs to be at least three times the size of the budget he got out of the 2010 review just to reverse the cuts. Ideally it should be large enough to build the 14,560 social rented homes a year that his evidence base suggests London needs \u2013 up to six times the current budget.</p> <p>That may sound unrealistic, but it would still be a fraction of the amount the government spends each year on housing benefit. Anything less will see problems like overcrowding continue to get worse, the benefit budget continue to rise, and our future economic prosperity undermined.</p> <p><em>Darren Johnson is a Green Party member of the </em><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/who-runs-london/the-london-assembly/about-london-assembly\" title=\"\"><em>London Assembly</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the latest jobs direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago I was part of a movement called Jubilee 2000, which changed the way people think about debt. It challenged a deeply held principle that \"debts must always be repaid\" by showing how, in the case of many debts owed by impoverished countries, the consequences of repayments were creating nearly unimaginable suffering.</p> <p>We were not calling for an act of charity, but a realisation that the economy we had created was structured in a way that was deeply unfair, exaggerating inequality and poverty in many parts of the world. We didn't want donations, but a change in the rules of engagement.</p> <p>The change in values that the jubilee movement effected forced decision-makers to enact policies that went some way to redressing this injustice. About $125bn of debt was wiped out, and governments were able to start spending money in ways that benefited their people.</p> <p>Yet only 10 years later we find ourselves at the centre of a debt crisis that suggests we were not as successful as we'd hoped. Certainly many were freed from \"debt slavery\", but globally debt boomed, as it was used as a means of papering over the cracks of inequality created by our ever-more global economy.</p> <p>Today, the poorest in our own societies are paying a very high price for a crisis created by reckless lending by banks and over-the-top borrowing. Little has been done to reform a system based on greed and speculation which is creating an even greater chasm between the haves and the have-nots.</p> <p>Of course there is no question that poverty in Europe, even post-crisis, is nowhere near as widespread as it was, and is, in some African countries. However, people in the most indebted European countries such as Greece are suffering rapidly rising poverty, homelessness, unemployment, violence and levels of inequality. For example, six months ago medical researchers reported a sharp rise in rates of suicide, murder and HIV/Aids in Greece as a result of the response to the economic crisis there.</p> <p>Ten years ago, we convinced people of the need for a different approach to debt by bringing to mind a very ancient concept \u2013 a jubilee, recognising the damage that very large debts can do to society. The Hebrew scriptures speak of a jubilee year in which debts are cancelled. They also call for restitution to be made for the damage done by debts \u2013 freeing those sold into slavery to help repay debts, returning lands that had been handed to financiers of debt.</p> <p>The importance of what might be called \"debt justice\" to a wider notion of fairness is not limited to Christianity and Judaism. The Qur'an condemns usury and requires zakah (almsgiving) as an essential duty to prevent wealth being accumulated only among the rich. Dharmic faiths from the Indian sub-continent teach similar principles, teaching that wealth is held not for oneself but on behalf of all human beings.</p> <p>In very different times, all of these faiths have tried to create solutions and to repair the damage that deep inequality can cause to our communities and societies. We would do well to adapt their solutions to the present day.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.jubileedebtcampaign.org.uk/jubilee\">What would a jubilee look like today</a>? First, as we said 10 years ago, when the payment of debts causes suffering, impoverishment and growing inequality, it cannot be right that they are paid. Debt is not simply the responsibility of the debtor, the burden of debt needs to be shared. The institutions that created the crisis cannot simply return to making profits with no care for the trail of devastation left behind by their decisions.</p> <p>Secondly, although debts can be just, when taken out in a democratic fashion for productive investment, they are not the only way for governments to raise funds. Taxes can ensure companies and investors in a country pay a fair share for being there. It provides a means of redistributing wealth in a global economy which, it is almost universally acknowledged, is too unequal. Progressive taxation is an important element of solving the problems of economic injustice.</p> <p>Finally, we must introduce rules to ensure financial markets work for people. Regulating flows of money will help move us away from an economy based on speculation and \"making money from money\". It will help control the lenders and will remove the control that financial markets have over every aspect of our lives. Returning money to its original purpose: a means of exchanging goods.</p> <p>Such a jubilee, then, goes well beyond cancelling some debt. Unjust debt is at the heart of our global economy; at the heart of deep inequality between rich and poor, as well as between rich and poor countries. If a jubilee is a call for justice, it must consist of far-reaching changes in the global economy to build a society based on justice, mutual support and community; an economic and political as well as spiritual renewal in our society.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron has made clear that the government has no intention of easing up on its austerity programme, insisting that Britain does not need a 'Plan B' despite concerns expressed by the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>The IMF has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/08/imf-warns-global-crisis-eurozonewould not soften\" title=\"\">cut its growth forecasts for Britain</a> and warned in its annual fiscal monitor on Tuesday that Britain will miss deficit reduction targets this year.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"These are difficult times for the economy and what the IMF report is doing is coming into line with other forecasters who have already said that growth is going to disappoint right across Europe this year. We know that,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p>\"The IMF also say we shouldn't abandon our plans in making reductions in government spending and also regrettably in some cases put up taxes to get on top of our debt and our deficit.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It's not 'Plan B' that we need. What we're doing is making sure that every part of 'Plan A' is firing on all cylinders.\"</p> <p>The government's target of reducing the cyclically adjusted annual deficit will be missed after the IMF estimated it will be reduced by 1.25% and 1.5% this year and next.</p> <p>Officials warned the UK that measures to boost growth will be needed if the economy fails to lift. They said the Treasury should put in place a Plan B to implement tax cuts and other measures to support businesses and consumers.</p> <p>The failure to restrict government spending puts the UK in the bottom third of developed nations, according to an IMF banding system that ranks countries into three groups.</p> <p>Britain, the US and France were held up by the Washington-based lender as among the worst performers, against Sweden and Denmark which appear in the top group.</p> <p>The IMF said it was difficult for the UK to reduce its annual deficit when tax receipts had declined in response to low growth, but it should continue to make strides to bring spending and income into balance.</p> <p>The cyclically adjusted annual deficit shows how well countries are balancing their budgets in normal times, without taking into account unusual costs or spending commitments.</p> <p>On Monday George Osborne said he would extend the government's cost-cutting programme until 2018, delaying the year that the UK achieves a balanced budget for three years based on estimates when it took office in 2010.</p> <p>Osborne expects the UK economy to recover over the next couple of years as consumers return to the high street and businesses begin to increase investment.</p> <p>He has also backed Bank of England initiatives to bring down borrowing costs to kickstart the housing market and encourage businesses to hire staff and expand production.</p> <p>But critics have called on the chancellor to take bold measures to support the economy and bolster confidence.</p> <p>Labour said the IMF report showed Osborne needed to adopt measures to boost growth without waiting to see if the situation deteriorated.</p> <p>Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: \"Twelve months ago, the IMF forecast growth of 1.6% in 2012 and said a plan B would be needed if growth were to be lower than expected. A year on, with Britain in a double-dip recession and growth forecast to be -0.4%, there can be no question that a change of course is urgently needed.</p> <p>\"The IMF has rightly warned that the government's policies risk causing permanent damage to our economy and growth is needed to get the deficit down. And, like Labour, they've said a Plan B should include temporary tax cuts and additional infrastructure investment. It's time David Cameron and George Osborne finally listened and took action to kickstart our economy before even more damage is done.\"</p> <p>Carlo Cottarelli, the head of the IMF's fiscal affairs department, said critics of austerity, such as the US economist Paul Krugman, should be taken seriously, but were misguided in thinking that international money markets would accept indebted countries overspending to boost growth.</p> <p>He said markets may accept stimulus packages by the US and UK in the short term, but could panic at a later stage, causing a catastrophic economic event.</p> <p>He said countries should move gradually to balance their budgets to protect vulnerable members of society from the worst effects of austerity.</p> <p>Asked if his advice applied to Greece and Portugal, he said that it was only possible to take a gradual approach when the international markets were satisfied the commitment and implementation were in place, which was not the case in peripheral eurozone nations.</p>",

From the vehicle's windows green and white flags flew.</p> <p>Inside were a dozen or so landless peasant farmers, heading to Delhi, the capital, to confront their nation's leaders and press their right to land. So far the marchers, 50,000-strong according to the organisers, have covered around 80 kilometres, not even a quarter of the distance they hope to travel. Their march will take another three weeks.</p> <p>They have come from Kerala in the south-west to Bengal in the north-east, all drawn from the poorest of the Indian poor. They had gathered at the northern town of Gwalior, and then set off last Wednesday, the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's birth, inspired by the independence leader's own tactics.</p> <p>PV Rajagopal, the veteran activist who organised the <em>yatra</em> (pilgrimage), told the Guardian that the participants' aim was not just to win a \"right to land\" but to fundamentally alter the direction of India's development.</p> <p>\"There is conflict at every level with the model we have now. Gandhi's vision in this country is being rejected every day. Now we have a capitalist, consumerist model. If India does not change this, the writing is on the wall,\" he said, explaining that a similar, smaller march in 2007 had had an insufficient impact.</p> <p>There are many who argue that such views are naive and that India's development \u2013 and thus the eradication of poverty \u2013 depends on urbanisation, massive investment in infrastructure and the development of a manufacturing base capable of providing employment for huge numbers of people, especially the young.</p> <p>Then there are those who argue that the sanctification of rural life inspired by Gandhi has contributed to the tenacity of poverty in India.</p> <p>Rajagopal, who made his name negotiating the surrender of bandits in the rough countryside around Gwalior in the early 1970s, disagrees.</p> <p>\"Nearly 100,000 villages have been destroyed since India gained its independence. I cannot accept industrialisation at this cost,\" he said.</p> <p>The inhabitants of Badpura exist on the margins of Indian society and economy. A cluster of mud-walled homes on a high, rocky ridge perched above the plains around Gwalior, it is home to around 100 families.</p> <p>Some are from the lowest ranks of the caste system, the millennia-old social hierarchy that is still powerful in India. Others are so-called \"adivasi\"<em> </em>(tribals), who can trace their origins back to the subcontinent's most ancient inhabitants and who often live in forest or hill areas that are now prized by industry for their raw materials. At best the <em>adiviasi</em> have gained little from the two decades of economic boom in India. Often they have lost a great deal.</p> <p>Certainly the \"Shining India\" of booming infotech industries and luxury car markets is a long way from Badpura. There is only a basic school, and healthcare is restricted to occasional visits by government health workers. One girl who can read and write her own name is proudly described as \"literate\". Meat is a rare treat. The villagers weed the local farmers' fields, earning 50 rupees (60p) a day. If they now have intermittent electricity, the villagers also suffer from soaring prices for basic foodstuffs and outbreaks of tuberculosis.</p> <p>\"It is tough but somehow we manage,\" said Sunder Bai, a mother of seven who did not know her own age.</p> <p>The key question for the villagers, as for so many in this vast but crowded country, is land. They want deeds to the scruffy patches of semi-scrub around Badpura that they have tilled or grazed livestock on for decades. But, at least in legal terms, these few hectares hacked out of the forest belong to the government The villagers have to fight a running battle with local officials who seize their tools and destroy their crops. Several have even been taken to court.</p> <p>\"We, the adivasis, are the owners, not the government. We own the forest because we have lived in the forests since forever. The firewood is ours but they take if from us,\" said Bai.</p> <p>Almost every group of marchers heading to Delhi has a similar story. Camped in a vast, derelict parade ground on the eve of the march, participants squatted around communal stoves to share rice or flat bread \u2013 their one meal of the day \u2013 before sleeping in the dust. Faded, frayed clothes hung from lines, drying in the dying rays of the sun.</p> <p>Nandina Devi, from a small village of dalits, the castes once known as \"untouchable\", in violence-prone Bihar state, said when she spoke out against harassment by officials she was accused of being a Naxalite, one of the Maoist guerillas waging an armed insurgency against central government.</p> <p>\"There is not one Maoist among us. We just want recognition that we own our land,\" she said.</p> <p>Kamdra Munda, a 45-year-old adivasi farmer from Chhattisgarh state, the heart of the Naxalite insurgency, said he too had been harassed. When he saw the masses gathered for the march he felt \"happy and brave\".</p> <p>The demonstration is a problem for the ruling Congress party which has long drawn support from the rural poor. Their votes will be crucial in elections due in 2014. Jairam Ramesh, minister for rural development, travelled to Gwalior in a bid to persuade the tens of thousands to abandon their plans.</p> <p>\"Your claims are justified. We are working on these issues,\" he told the crowds.</p> <p>With Ramesh, evidence of how little some things in India change, was a local Congress MP, Jjyotiraditya Scindia. The giant fort which dominates Gwalior was for centuries the seat of the Scindia dynasty.

  "<p>Are you British or Scottish? Do you live in the UK or England &amp; Wales?</p> <p>It matters because statistics - the way we actually have any idea about where we live - are increasingly not available for the UK as a nation. </p> <p>And as it looks possible that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/scottish-independence-essential-guide\">devolution could become independence for Scotland</a>, we could be seeing the end of the UK in data too.</p> <p>Love or loathe devolution, this matters - especially if you care for open data.</p> <p>How does the UK split up? You'd think anyone who has studied geography here would know the answer, but there is still confusion. When we published <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/jun/01/young-people-living-home-map\">this map of young adults who still live at home</a>, one user <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2012/jun/01/young-people-living-home-map?commentpage=2#comment-16408948\">commented</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"\"Britain's\" young adults? and the map shows Scotland, Wales and England.

The United Kingdom is divided into England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Channel Islands, incidentally, are a British Crown dependency and not part of the UK.</p> <p>Britain is just England, Wales and Scotland - not Northern Ireland.</p> <p>And the whole nation is divided up into what the Office for National Statistics (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/16417454\">but not all of our users</a>) calls <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/who-we-are/services/idbr/standard-analysis-from-the-idbr/local-authorities/index.html\">local authorities</a>, which manage local services in each area. If you want to see variations across the country, then that is the minimum local breakdown needed. Of course, many statistics are published at that local level and for the whole UK - unemployment for instance. But often that is no longer the case.</p> <p>Four separate statistics bodies operate in almost blissful independence of one another: the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/index.html\">Office for National Statistics</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/About/NatStats\">Scottish Government</a>, <a href=\"http://statswales.wales.gov.uk/index.htm\">StatsWales</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nisra.gov.uk/\">Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency</a>.</p> <p>Take crime, for instance. Until recently the Home Office published something called the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/research-statistics/crime/crime-statistics/british-crime-survey/\">British Crime Survey</a>, which surveyed thousands of people about their personal experiences of crime. </p> <p>But in the late 1980s it stopped covering Scotland - where it was replaced by the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Crime-Justice/crime-and-justice-survey\">Scottish Crime and Justice Survey</a>. Now England and Wales has the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=Crime+in+England+and+Wales\">Crime Survey for England and Wales</a> and Northern Ireland has an <a href=\"http://www.csu.nisra.gov.uk/survey.asp8.htm\">irregular crime survey of its own</a>.</p> <p>The rationale is that because Scotland has its own criminal system, it's not comparable. Yet the <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/\">UN manages to compare a variety of crimes from completely different countries for its annual crime survey</a> and there are more differences between entirely separate nations in crime, say, than in a devolved single nation.</p> <p>And the result? We rarely see studies comparing crime in London, say, with Glasgow? </p> <p>The census is another example - split into <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/index.html\">England &amp; Wales</a>, <a href=\"http://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/\">Scotland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nisra.gov.uk/Census.html\">Northern Ireland</a>. Recorded every ten years, this is arguably the UK's most important dataset, yet published at different times and for different regional breakdowns.</p> <p>But even for less controversial data, each week brings separate releases from separate places.</p> <p>In the last month, <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/release-calendar/index.html\">the National Statistics gateway shows 98 government releases are available for the UK as a whole</a>. But how many of those are broken down? Most are the big figures such as GDP, if you want a breakdown even at <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/release-calendar/index.html?newquery=*&amp;lday=-29&amp;lmonth=0&amp;lyear=0&amp;uday=0&amp;umonth=0&amp;uyear=0&amp;theme=&amp;source-agency=&amp;coverage=UK&amp;designation=&amp;geographic-breakdown=Country&amp;title=&amp;pagetype=calendar-entry&amp;sortBy=releaseDate&amp;sortDirection=EITHER\">country level, (ie, England &amp; Wales, Scotland, etc) then there are 12 releases</a>. And only another seven are available at local authority and county level - which is the minimum breakdown you need for any kind of regional rigour. Only one was valuable at the really granular \"super output area\": the <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/personal-tax-credits/menu.htm\">child tax credit statistics for 2010 from the HMRC</a>. </p> <p>That's one dataset which is two years old.</p> <p>Click the links below and you will get different releases for different parts of the UK, each appearing to have very little coordination with the other.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/release-calendar/index.html?newquery=*&amp;lday=-29&amp;lmonth=0&amp;lyear=0&amp;uday=0&amp;umonth=0&amp;uyear=0&amp;theme=%22%22&amp;source-agency=%22%22&amp;coverage=England+and+Wales&amp;designation=&amp;geographic-breakdown=%22%22&amp;title=%22%22&amp;pagetype=calendar-entry&amp;sortBy=releaseDate&amp;sortDirection=EITHER\">England and Wales</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/release-calendar/index.html?newquery=*&amp;lday=-29&amp;lmonth=0&amp;lyear=0&amp;uday=0&amp;umonth=0&amp;uyear=0&amp;theme=%22%22&amp;source-agency=%22%22&amp;coverage=England&amp;designation=&amp;geographic-breakdown=%22%22&amp;title=%22%22&amp;pagetype=calendar-entry&amp;sortBy=releaseDate&amp;sortDirection=EITHER\">England</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/release-calendar/index.html?newquery=*&amp;lday=-29&amp;lmonth=0&amp;lyear=0&amp;uday=0&amp;umonth=0&amp;uyear=0&amp;theme=%22%22&amp;source-agency=%22%22&amp;coverage=Scotland&amp;designation=&amp;geographic-breakdown=%22%22&amp;title=%22%22&amp;pagetype=calendar-entry&amp;sortBy=releaseDate&amp;sortDirection=EITHER\">Scotland</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/release-calendar/index.html?newquery=*&amp;lday=-29&amp;lmonth=0&amp;lyear=0&amp;uday=0&amp;umonth=0&amp;uyear=0&amp;theme=%22%22&amp;source-agency=%22%22&amp;coverage=Northern+Ireland&amp;designation=&amp;geographic-breakdown=%22%22&amp;title=%22%22&amp;pagetype=calendar-entry&amp;sortBy=releaseDate&amp;sortDirection=EITHER\">Northern Ireland</a>.</p> <p>So, in one 30-day period, Northern Ireland has seen releases on <a href=\"http://www.nisra.gov.uk/demography/default.asp17.htm\">population</a> and <a href=\"http://www.detini.gov.uk/stats-pubs-35\">women</a>; Scotland has published <a href=\"http://www.isdscotland.org/Health-Topics/Child-Health/Publications/index.asp?ID=860\">child immunisation statistics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Crime-Justice\">reconviction rates</a>; Wales has put out <a href=\"http://wales.gov.uk/topics/statistics/headlines/schools2012/121004/?lang=en\">exam results</a> and <a href=\"http://wales.gov.uk/topics/statistics/headlines/health2012/1209272/?lang=en\">health statistics</a>. Meanwhile, England has published <a href=\"http://www.education.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s001068/index.shtml\">School admission appeals</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nta.nhs.uk/statistics.aspx\">drug treatment</a> figures and <a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/research_and_statistics/3375.aspx\">museum activity</a>.</p> <p>The argument is beyond devolution of power or different statistical fiefdoms. After all, not everything is national - but when you are publishing equivalent figures for different parts of the UK, why not coordinate them? Why not publish the same census details on the same day - instead of different figures at different times?</p> <p>The answer is probably resources - and a gradual parting of the statistical ways as different organisations produces the statistics wanted at the devolved government level. </p> <p>In fact, it is often easier to get across statistics from European countries via <a href=\"http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home/\">Eurostat</a> now than it is to get figures for the whole of the UK at a local level. That is because Eurostat has a single operation to combine data from across the European Union into single accessible datasets by coordinating all the national statistics agencies. The UK, with increasingly disparate data sources, needs that now. And it's kind of what we expect from the Office for National Statistics. The title says it all.</p> <p>Yes, it would cost money. But if things carry on as they are now, the long-term effect is that England is compared only to England; Scotland to Scotland; Wales to Wales; and Northern Ireland to Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Maybe, in a devolved nation, that's what we want. But it raises a bigger question, which is pretty fundamental for all of us: if the UK gradually ceases to exist as a statistical entity, then does it still exist as a country?</p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022&#xa0;Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>Pakistan is set to become the first country in south Asia to introduce the pneumococcal vaccine to protect children against pneumonia, one of the biggest killers of children under five in the developing world. The programme is due to be announced by the country's prime minister, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, on Tuesday, signalling clear political commitment from the Pakistani government in rolling out the vaccine.</p> <p>The latest UN estimates indicate that pneumococcal disease accounts for 18% of child mortality \u2013 the primary cause of death among young children globally. In Pakistan, more than 423,000 children die before reaching their fifth birthday, and almost one in five of these deaths is due to pneumonia. The new pneumococcal vaccine is expected to prevent a significant proportion of pneumonia cases, and has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives.</p> <p>The vaccine \u2013 to be introduced under Pakistan's expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) \u2013 comes to Pakistan with the help of the <a href=\"http://www.gavialliance.org\" title=\"\">Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation</a> (Gavi) in partnership with <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/\" title=\"\">Unicef</a>, the UN children's agency, and the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\" title=\"\">World Health Organisation</a>.</p> <p>Previously, it took about 10 to 15 years for developing countries like Pakistan to get newer vaccines. But as Gavi is covering about 95% of the cost, newer medicaments such as pneumococcal and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/yemen-plan-vaccinate-children-rotavirus\" title=\"\">rotavirus</a> vaccines are being introduced in developing countries simultaneously with developed countries.</p> <p>The chairman of Pakistan's immunisation technical advisory group, Dr Tariq Bhutta, <a href=\"http://dawn.com/2012/10/05/anti-pneumonia-vaccine-added-to-epi-regime/\" title=\"\">told the Dawn newspaper last week</a> that the vaccine cost $45 (\u00a328) a unit in the US, but that Gavi had bought the vaccine from the world's two leading manufacturers at a cost of $3.50 a unit to introduce it in south Asia.</p> <p>\"It is really extremely positive that the political leadership is behind this,\" said Helen Evans, deputy chief executive of Gavi. \"The fact that the prime minister is announcing this sends out an important message.\"</p> <p>Evans expressed concern about the possible negative fallout from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/11/cia-fake-vaccinations-osama-bin-ladens-dna\" title=\"\">CIA's decision to use a fake vaccination programme to confirm the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden</a>, the al-Qaida leader, last year. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/health/cia-vaccine-ruse-in-pakistan-may-have-harmed-polio-fight.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">There have been reports that vaccination against polio \u2013 which has never been eradicated in Pakistan \u2013 has suffered setbacks</a> following the Bin Laden killing.</p> <p>\"We are concerned about the fallout and the publicity around the polio campaign,\" she said. \"It really damages public trust. So there is an important role for the media in stressing the value and usefulness of vaccines. I wouldn't underestimate concern, particularly in tribal areas, but we need to focus on the fact that this will save children's lives.\"</p> <p>For the first three months, the pneumococcal vaccine is due to be rolled out in Punjab province, where half of Pakistan's population lives. Sindh will be next, then the rest of the country in the six to 12 months following (although provinces will have to be assessed for their readiness). The plan is for the vaccine to be rolled out in Bangladesh next year.</p> <p>\"As the first country in south Asia to introduce the pneumococcal vaccine, Pakistan's commitment to immunising all children against vaccine-preventable diseases is to be applauded,\" said Dan Rohrmann, Unicef's Pakistan country representative.</p> <p>The pneumococcal vaccine has been rolled out in 16 developing countries to date, most of them in Africa. <a href=\"http://www.gavialliance.org/support/nvs/pneumococcal/\" title=\"\">Gavi and its partners plan to immunise 90 million children with pneumococcal vaccines</a> in more than 50-Gavi supported countries by 2015.</p>",

Mitochondrial DNA tests are to be carried out along with comparisons with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/12/canadian-descendant-richard-iii-dna\">samples of a living descendant </a>which could establish the truth.</p> <p>Support for a York burial has already been voiced on the site by enthusiasts from Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, all over the United States and of course in the UK. One British expat commenting on the site, from Maine, in the US says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm British, an historian, and ardent supporter of Richard III whose reputation was destroyed and vilified for more than five centuries as a murderer and usurper. His heart lay in his beloved Yorkshire, and it is fitting that after all he was denied following his untimely death at Bosworth, that he should now be laid to rest in that part of England which he loved above all others. </p> <p>He despised London, and Leicester was the scene of his brutal death. Why should he be associated now with either place? Place him in York, where he himself hoped to be laid to rest.</p> </blockquote> <p>The foundation itself is calling for the bones, including a distorted spine similar to Richard's 'crookback', to be brought home to York and interred at York Minster.

He spent much of his youth <a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.17191\">at Middleham castle </a>and for 12 years he ruled the North of England on behalf of his elder brother, King Edward IV, earning a widespread reputation for fair-mindedness and justice. </p> <p>After becoming king, he visited York several times and was showered with gifts each time. His son, Edward, was crowned Prince of Wales whilst in York. If people are in agreement with us, we ask that they sign this petition and pass it on to others so we may hope to achieve this goal.</p> <p>Andy Smith, UK director for the group, adds: </p> <blockquote> <p>York was Richard's city. It is where he belongs, and it is only right that this great Lord of the North should return home to Yorkshire after more than five hundred years' enforced absence.</p> </blockquote> <p>The results of the DNA tests are expected during December at the earliest.

  "<p>When Michael O'Leary, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com/en\" title=\"\">Ryanair</a>, recently whipped up a social media storm after calling a customer who had criticised his airline on Facebook \"an idiot\", he unwittingly demonstrated how an organisation's attitude to digital is led from the top.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.lasa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Lasa</a> we've been funded by Google to help charities engage with digital, and our goal is to get the key issues on decision makers' agendas. We asked leading figures in the voluntary sector across the globe to tell us, in bullet point form, what five things their peers needed to know about digital. The resulting crowdsourced Digital: what every charity leader should know report includes contributions from Martha Lane Fox, Beth Kanter, Unicef UK and JustGiving. Their views are a call to arms to charity leaders to maximise digital's potential for income generation, collaboration and reaching stakeholders, ultimately creating a more sustainable sector.</p> <p>We'll be debating the report's findings at a special Lasa event for charity chief executives and opinion leaders on 6 November hosted by commercial and charity law firm <a href=\"http://www.bateswells.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bates Wells and Braithwaite</a>. And we're inviting anyone in the sector to share their ideas on what every charity leader should know about digital by tweeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LasaICT\" title=\"\">@Lasaict </a>using the hashtag #Lasaleaders.</p> <h2>The key insights from the report are:</h2> <p>\u2022 Digital is vital for charity leadership. Beth Kanter, author of The Networked NonProfit, advised charity leaders to \"be present, authentic, and human on social networks, sharing a bit of yourself as well as your organisation's goals\". Meanwhile Graham Fisher from <a href=\"http://www.toynbeehall.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Toynbee Hall</a> said that fellow chief executives should deploy digital to \"improve your service access, effectiveness, efficiency and quality, opening new markets for new products.\" Sam Matthews, acting chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.ces-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Charities Evaluation Services</a>, warned that chief executives must own digital, \"driving the agenda forward\" and using it to monitor impact through tools such as databases.</p> <p>\u2022 Digital must be part of your organisational strategy. Martha Lane Fox, chair of <a href=\"http://www.go-on.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Go ON UK</a>, highlighted the growth of digital fundraising (in the last quarter of last year 15% of donations were made online), telling charity leaders that there was \"no time to waste\" in getting digital strategies in place.</p> <p>Doug Jacquier, strategy consultant, emphasised digital engagement as critical: \"A technology plan is core to your strategic survival \u2013 if you're not understanding and managing your organisation's technology, you shouldn't be in the job.\" Karl Wilding, head of foresight at <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NCVO</a>, said that leaders also need to \"plan for the opportunities (outcomes measurement; better fundraising) and costs (data protection and management) that big data are going to bring.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Charity leaders should innovate and engage through digital. Digital tools can reinvigorate relationships with stakeholders and reach new audiences. Independent charity adviser Rosie Chapman discussed how the <a href=\"http://www.hawkandowl.org/\" title=\"\">Hawk and Owl Trust</a>'s online webcam of nesting peregrines led to an increase in membership and donations. Marnie Webb, Co-head of <a href=\"http://www.techsoupglobal.org/\" title=\"\">Techsoup Global</a>, described how technology can help a charity's supporters take immediate actions (eg post-disaster relief) using tools such as <a href=\"http://www.ushahidi.com/\" title=\"\">Ushahidi</a>. Damien Austin-Walker, head of digital at <a href=\"http://vinspired.com/\" title=\"\">vInspired</a>, predicted that \"tablet will become the new desktop\" and that \"second screen usage is becoming the norm.\"</p> <p>As the choice of digital media expands, Rachel Beer, founder of <a href=\"http://hellobeautifulworld.com/\" title=\"\">Beautiful World</a>, told charity leaders that their organisations must \"stand out and be interesting, not just worthy\" in an increasingly crowded marketplace.</p> <p>\u2022 Digital can improve the bottom line. Nigel Lewis, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/\" title=\"\">AbilityNet</a>, stated that digital can help charities save money and time, as \"solutions and service providers exist at very low or no cost.\" Danielle Atkinson, head of digital and individual giving at <a href=\"http://www.merlin.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Merlin</a>, said digital pays dividends in the long run: \"Income generation won't happen overnight and you can't expect any gains if you don't invest or resource digital properly.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Social media can help charity leaders connect directly with stakeholders. Lucy Caldicott, director of fundraising at <a href=\"http://www.clicsargent.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Clic Sargent</a>, said that social media is an \"invaluable way to keep your finger on the pulse.\" Ross McCulloch, founder of <a href=\"http://thirdsectorlab.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Thirdsectorlab</a>, counselled against leaders posting \"a stream of organisational updates\", if they truly want to connect with supporters, who \"want to know about the opinions, work and passions of you as a chief executive/chair/director/.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Mobile is the future. Holly Ross, executive director of US non-profit <a href=\"http://www.nten.org/\" title=\"\">Nten</a>, thinks that mobile is the \"next big tech innovation,\", while Paul de Gregorio, head of mobile at <a href=\"http://openfundraising.com/\" title=\"\">Open Fundraising</a>, went further, saying charity leaders should be aware that mobile is now mainstream: \"Thanks to high profile events like <a href=\"http://www.comicrelief.com/\" title=\"\">Comic Relief</a>, the public are increasingly used to donating by text.\"</p> <p>The message from the report is clear. Digital won't just help build a more sustainable sector; it's a vital element of charity leadership.
