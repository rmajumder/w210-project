Abandon Normal Devices takes place across Manchester, with satellite goings-on throughout the north-west, and is determined to provide distinctly unorthodox thrills, with over 100 events including exhibitions, installations, performances, screenings and parties. Brooklyn artists Todd Chandler and Jeff Stark set up their Empire Drive-In at Manchester Q-Park.

No sweeping mountain vistas or comely lakes for her. Unloved, overlooked urban scrub is her preferred territory, which she often ventures to at night using a glaring flash. The results frequently look more like primordial jungles or monsters from the id than the stuff of country walks. Her work recently reached its biggest audience yet, thanks to her commission for the Olympics site: a translation of a painting wriggling with giant arteries and orange creepers on to thousands of tiles like those once produced in the East End. Here she returns to her familiar material, oil on aluminium sheets, and scales things down with a  series of smaller works.<em><br></br>SS<br></br><a href=\"http://www.modernart.net\">Modern Art</a>, W1, Thu to 28 Sep</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Stuart Shave/Modern Art, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395093757\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345722320877/Daniel-Sinsel-001-thumb-7725.jpg\" alt=\"Exhibitionist 25/08: Daniel Sinsel\" width=\"68\" height=\"68\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Daniel Sinsel, London</strong><br></br>Art and sex prove dangerous bedfellows in Daniel Sinsel\u2019s work.

Yet, whether it\u2019s a real penis or a symbolic parsnip, there\u2019s a tacit threat in all the fragmented body parts, as if the act of depicting and looking were a form of exacting butchery.

  "<h2><strong>Secretsundaze Go Bang!, London</strong></h2> <p>Secretsundaze's big bank holiday party was just one of the events left without a home following the demise of the London (Dis)Pleasure Gardens. However, after a fortnight of frantic phonecalls, they've secured a venue that's every bit as spectacular as previous Secretsundaze locations \u2013 and certainly easier to get to than Pontoon Dock. Camden's Roundhouse may be best known for its rock gigs and circus shows, but it has a rave heritage stretching back to the psychedelic happenings of the late-60s, not to mention Spiral Tribe's free parties in the early 90s. Even though noise restrictions prevent a full-on terrace rave, the Roundhouse skylights will be opened, transforming the whole feel of the main hall. Four Tet and Matthew Herbert are the big-name headliners, while there's bassier stuff in the studio from Ill Blu and DjRUM. After nightfall, the fun continues down the road at Proud Camden with the impeccable selections of Levon Vincent and Ben UFO.</p> <p><strong><em>Roundhouse, NW1, Sun</em></strong></p> <p><em>Sam Richards</em></p> <h2><strong>Anagram, Edinburgh</strong></h2> <p>Few venues can promise a night guaranteed to give you the willies, although many would imply that anything's possible if you play your cards right. Located in Edinburgh's underground vaults, once housing the city's worst poverty-stricken slums, the aptly named Banshee Labyrinth claims to be Scotland's most haunted nightclub and hosts this month's outing by the Anagram guys. Resident DJs Dijimij, Steev-e and Kol spin their usual mix of acid, tribal techno and old school punk, warming up the dancefloor for Londoner and acid techno producer Guy \"Geezer\" McAffer, scaring off any errant spirits with a live techno set. Best known for his involvement with both the RAW (Ripe Analogue Waveforms) and WAH WAH labels, Geezer has been a driving force in the birth and development of the underground acid techno sound that is unique to London. Admission's free, so don't be expecting any refunds if the resident spooks Old Jack, Molly, Willy and the Watcher fail to materialise.</p> <p><strong><em>The Banshee Labyrinth, Niddry Street, Sat</em> </strong></p> <p><em>Patric Baird</em></p> <h2><strong>Memorex, Cardiff</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395095758\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345725241231/Derrick-Carter-008.jpg\" alt=\"Derrick Carter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derrick Carter.

Its first 'proper' underground dance club, Aura, opened a few months ago and has all the required elements in place, most notably a thumping sound system guaranteed to re-arrange the sturdiest of body parts. After a run of high-profile guests, the club's flagship night Memorex hosts a five-hour show from the legend that is Derrick Carter. A key figure in the 'second wave' of Chicago house back in the early-90s, Carter delivers every time, switching between old-school disco, soul and jazz while retaining the essential optimism of early house. An utterly essential evening.</p> <p><strong><em>Aura, Mill Lane, Sat</em></strong></p> <p><em>John Mitchell</em></p> <h2><strong>Carnival Afterparties, London</strong></h2> <p>There are some regular Carnival-goers who maintain that following your nose to find the best impromptu parties is all part of the fun. But there are plenty of enticing ticketed events taking place as well. Staunch have commandeered the Supperclub with Loefah, Zed Bias and A Guy Called Gerald; Benji B's Deviation posse pitch camp at Paradise with special guests Zinc, Toddla T, Oneman and IG Culture (and there's even a bonus PA from 90s soulman Omar); and Rompa's Reggae Shack have The Garden Bar, with Wookie and Marcus Visionary slowly ratcheting up the tempo as the night goes on.</p> <p><strong><em>Various venues, W10, Mon </em></strong></p> <p><em>SR</em></p> <h2><strong>Werk, Darlington</strong></h2> <p>Ravers are usually spoiled for choice on August bank holiday and this year is no exception. Tomorrow's Werk party in Darlington is one such treat, with the musically savvy promoters showcasing the deep, Detroit house scene with the appearance of Marcellus Pittman. A member of the 3 Chairs collective, Pittman is not as well known as partners Moodymann and Theo Parrish, but on several joint dates in the UK, has outshone his high profile colleagues as a DJ.</p> <p><strong><em>Inside Out, Beaumont Street, Sun</em></strong></p> <p><em>Marc Rowlands</em></p>",
  "<p>The heading on a national newspaper advert from a claims management company (CMC) \u2013 \"Mis-sold solar water heating?\" \u2013 is the latest move by an industry of more than 3,000 claims handling firms looking for the next new thing after hoovering up huge profits from payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling.</p> <p>The ad, from Cheshire-based Consumer Reclaim, continues: \"If you think you've been sold a Solar Hot Water Heating System by the exaggeration of its benefits, you could be entitled to claim back the full cost.\"</p> <p>Readers will remember that many high-selling-pressure firms were named and shamed here four or so years back for claiming far higher benefits from hot-water panels on a roof than were justified. And they charged consumers, who wanted to be \"green\", up to three times the fair cost of around \u00a34,500 per installation.</p> <p>Consumer Reclaim states it is \"currently handling claims\" against a number of companies, including Smart Energy (UK), Ultimate Energy, Simplee Solar, Solar Direct UK, Solar Home Energy, Solsave and Solarsol UK. They all sold systems, and have now gone bust.</p> <p>Guardian Money asked Consumer Reclaim, which is \"regulated by the Ministry of Justice in respect of claims management activities\" (registration number CRM23523), how anyone could sue a company that was dissolved or in liquidation and so has no funds, however good a case there might be for a payback for inappropriate selling.</p> <p>It has not responded to our inquries. But taking the \"30-second claim test\" on its website \u2013 it actually takes five seconds \u2013 showed that potential claimants need to have paid via a loan, probably with a credit card. Those who paid cash are told they have no case. Consumer Reclaim believes it can take action, on a \"no-win, no-fee\" basis, against banks and other lenders under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, the legal framework for compensation if a holiday or other firm goes bust and you lose \u00a3100 or more.</p> <p>The large credit card companies we contacted say they have so far not seen or heard of any claims, although they concede that some in the credit industry may have. But they say Section 75 is more about a failure to deliver rather than over-pricing. One bank that did not wish to be quoted said: \"If we paid for all exaggerated prices, we would probably end up giving nearly everyone who ever had a home improvement their money back.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice says claims handlers are generally regulated either for personal injury or financial product mis-selling work. There is no suggestion that credit card and other loan companies mis-sold solar panel products.</p> <p>The MoJ says firms can use their registration on adverts even if the activity promoted is not one covered by the registration.</p> <p>Consumer Reclaim is part of Consumer Reclaim Ltd, whose sole director is 51-year-old Roger Anthony Pritchard. According to Companies House records, Consumer Reclaim Ltd has failed to send in annual returns due on 12 May and is subject to a \"proposal to strike off\". This could cause difficulties for anyone who has a contract with them.</p> <p>Guardian Money found one other company offering redress for solar panel purchasers \u2013 Assist Reclaim \u2013 with a similar website. It has one director, again a Roger Anthony Pritchard, of Hale, Cheshire. In October 2006, the Financial Services Authority issued a notice against Stockport-based First Legal Services, where Pritchard was also a director. The watchdog cancelled its permission to deal in FSA-regulated activities. It said: \"The FSA is not satisfied that you are a fit and proper person, having regard to all the circumstances, including the need to ensure that your business is conducted soundly and properly.\" First Legal Services went into compulsory liquidation in 2009 after the Official Receiver intervened.</p> <p>Although there are 3,000 claims companies, a freedom of information request shows the MoJ has just 58 staff to manage claims companies, mainly agency or contract workers, an average of one person for each 52 firms.</p> <p>In the year to 31 March, 409 claims companies \u2013 about one in eight \u2013 were warned, suspended or had their registration cancelled, according to the MoJ annual report this month .</p> <p>Head of claims management regulation Kevin Rousell said: \"The mass mis-selling of payment protection insurance has seen a surge in the number of companies operating in the financial claims management sector. Poor practice is rife among some claims management companies, which are falling over each other to get claimants' business. To help tackle this we have set up a specialist team to root out the poor practices used by some companies presenting claims for mis-sold PPI. Our investigators are using effective enforcement to stop bad practice and improve the industry once and for all.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Other on-going tasks include working with regulators and industry bodies to clamp down on unsolicited text messaging, identifying businesses that take upfront fees and misleading marketing.\"</p> <p>Unsolicited texts sent to me include \"We have been trying to contact you regarding your accident, we now have details of how much you are due.\" Although the firm is unidentified, there was no attempt to contact me \u2013 and I have had no accident (other than bashing my thumb with a hammer). Another said: \"There is \u00a32,351.23 waiting in your name for the mis-selling of PPI on your loans and credit cards. To get this ASAP, reply PPi [sic] to this message NOW.\" As someone who campaigned against PPI in these pages, I can confidently say I have never taken it out.</p> <p>Hertfordshire-based independent financial adviser (IFA) Alan Lakey of Highclere Financial Services is glad to hear that the MoJ is getting tougher with PPI claims, but wishes the new zeal was extended to other financial claims.</p> <p>\"I don't want people to be mis-sold \u2013 the bad reputation affects IFAs who are innocent,\" he says. \"But in common with many other small advice firms, I've had nonsense letters from claims managers on behalf of clients who do not even know they are complaining. Some have been hoodwinked into giving a claims manager details of their IFA. The CMC then lists everything including the kitchen sink against me. I've been accused of mis-selling an Isa when it was a pension, and vice versa. I write back \u2013 this costs time and money \u2013 to say they can't accuse me of mis-selling or not advising properly or not discussing relative risk because they don't know.</p> <p>\"They then escalate it to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which currently costs me \u00a3500 a case after the first three a year (due to go up to 25 soon) but nothing for them, even though they can collect up to 30% of any compensation. I also have more expenses in dealing with the case in detail. I know of firms including big life companies would rather pay up \u00a31,000 to \u00a33,000 just to get rid of the aggravation; in some cases their professional liability insurers tell them to do this as it's cheaper. It's true. These phoney claims cost me around \u00a32,500 on average if you count my own time.\"</p> <p>The ombudsman service says it has seen some inquiries about solar panels but has yet to give a formal ruling.</p> <p>It adds: \"Consumers can come to the ombudsman if they are unhappy with the results of a failed section 75 claim in relation to this subject. As we discussed, it's not black and white (it rarely is) but that's where we step in anyway.</p> <p>\"Consumers don't need to use claims managers to bring a complaint about section 75 \u2013 or any financial product. We will ask the consumer to explain what has gone wrong in their own words. You don't need to be a financial expert to use the service.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>I fear I won't appear reliable or dedicated. How can I avoid this?</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>I have just defended my PhD thesis and, in principle, am about to enter the job market. I am a theoretical biologist and, while I have a variety of transferable skills, I am not in a position to apply for many jobs beyond those which provide graduate training schemes, as some pharmaceutical companies do. I am also trying to arrange a post-doctoral position as I have missed the deadlines for a lot of the industry graduate programmes.</strong></p> <p><strong>But I don't know if I should apply for a job and then withdraw if I succeed in getting post-doctoral funding. I am worried that if I give research a shot and find I don't like it, I will have burnt my bridges with certain companies. </strong></p> <p><strong>I can't afford to put all my eggs in one basket (academic or industry) as positions are scarce in both, and I'm worried I won't appear reliable or dedicated. My somewhat esoteric skills also worry me, as I will be older and less suited than students coming straight out of college with a specialised degree.</strong></p> <p><strong>Overall, I might appear both unsuitable and unreliable. Can you advise me how to avoid this?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I understand your anxieties but you're letting them run away with you. You're fretting about so many things that may never happen, you're becoming incapable of positive action.</p> <p>It's perfectly reasonable for someone in your position to apply for jobs in pharmaceutical companies while, at the same time, hoping for post-doctoral funding. Most companies would understand if, having been offered a job, you decided to take up a post-doctoral position. It's a fact of recruitment life. It might cause them short-lived inconvenience but they'd have other excellent candidates on their lists.</p> <p>But this is what concerns me most: because you're still unsure what you want to do with your life, you think that, having decided to \"give research a shot\", you might find you don't like it. I hope, by that, you don't mean you'd quit immediately?</p> <p>You badly need to simplify your options \u2013 apply for jobs and research funding with equal enthusiasm. If you're lucky enough to be offered funding, grab it gratefully and learn all you can in that first year. Like a great many people, you probably won't know what you want to do until you've started doing it.</p> <p>At the end of that year, you'll know a lot more about yourself and be an even more interesting candidate if you do decide to switch careers. If you don't get funding, none of the complications you've allowed yourself to conjure up will happen, anyway. Cut down on the thinking and step up the action.</p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Think hard about what you really want to do, and once you've decided, go for that. If you fail, then you could try the other option later \u2013 I don't think either industry or academia would fault you for that \u2013 but this time around you need to know what you want to do and be able to say so clearly and articulately to an employer. <strong>SpursSupporter</strong></p> <p> \u2022 There are probably a lot more commercial jobs for biologists than you think, particularly if you look outside of research (eg, patent attorney), across Europe, or into emerging fields like biotech. It also sounds as if you might be setting your sights too low and \"underselling\" yourself. A PhD makes you over-qualified for the first degree/graduate training schemes jobs you are talking about going for. <strong>oommph</strong></p> <h2><strong>I played safe but I'm unhappy and want a career in politics</strong></h2> <p><strong>I've always been interested in politics and the third sector, but as I graduated with a middling English degree, I decided to take the safest course and apply to graduate schemes. I am working for a big organisation on a good salary. I have a large peer group, job security and a lot of training and development. But it's not an environment in which I want to work, and I'm unhappy. How can I make the move to the political sphere, that I would enjoy more, and when would the timing be right? I have been in my current job for just over a year and the graduate programme is two years long. Would leaving early have any negative repercussions on my CV?</strong></p> <p><strong>I had hoped the business experience I am gaining will be helpful, but the long hours mean I have no time for any volunteering. I'm worried I'm not qualified in the right ways for a job in politics. Would going back to university to do a master's in politics help, or just be an additional expense?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>There should be a standard box at the head of this column that appears every week and says something like: \"Ask not what your employer can do for you \u2013 ask what you can do for your employer.\" Your interest in politics and the third sector is a long-standing one. You know why it attracts you. It's now high time that you worked out why you might have something to offer politics.</p> <p>A high proportion of people in politics \u2013 elected representatives, special advisers, members of thinktanks \u2013 have been politically active all their grown-up lives. They've joined clubs, made friends and contacts, attended conferences, contributed to political journals \u2013 and have thereby made names for themselves. So when opportunities arise, they are the names that are first considered. That's not as shady as it may sound: they've served an apprenticeship.</p> <p>You haven't. So instead, you need to work out what you could bring to the party. And, given your circumstances, it has to be an outside perspective; the application of knowledge and disciplines acquired in the real world.</p> <p>So don't even think of leaving your privileged graduate programme early. That could be your best calling card. But do - somehow \u2013 also find the time to get involved with politics at a personal, social and local level<strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Readers say</strong></p> <p>\u2022 If you want to be an elected politician don't quit your day job. Join your preferred party, and work for them as a volunteer. When the opportunity arises, you can stand as a candidate in local elections. Don't worry about winning at first, just experience what it is like to campaign. When you've accumulated knowledge of how things work, you can get approval to stand for the position you really want \u2013 be it in local government, Westminster, the regional assemblies, or the European Parliament. <strong>outer</strong></p> <p> \u2022 I got into social policy work in the 3rd sector, and now local government, without a master's in politics etc, but I had the transferable skills (good written English, negotiation, political awareness, working with all sorts of partners and other organisations). But you normally have to toe the party line.

If Julian got into a&#xa0;dispute with another child, I would never take his side just because he was my son.</p> <p>Jules has always been extremely interested in finding the truth, no matter what the subject \u2013 medicine, environment, nature, physics. One thing you might not know about him is that as a child he used to play a mean blues harp. He was also extremely physically adventurous. Someone asked the other day if he'd like going to live in Ecuador, and I said one of the things he'd love about it is the climbing. When he was a little boy, he used to make rafts on the river. He was always exploring in the bush. At one point, when he was about 24, he took off into the Tasmanian wilderness with just a knife and pitted himself against nature to see if he could survive out there. The idea of Julian being this nerd behind a computer is completely wrong.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesball\" title=\"\">James Ball</a>, former WikiLeaks staffer<br></h2> <p>Virtually everyone has a Julian they want to see \u2013 either a visionary hero of the free speech movement, or a paranoid, narcissistic creep who's&#xa0;a danger to civilised society. The reality would satisfy neither side.</p> <p>He's an incredibly driven man, with an impressively keen intellect. He also has, on rare occasions, a disarming sense of humour, sometimes even self-deprecating.</p> <p>Of course, here comes the inevitable \"but\". The&#xa0;bad sides of Julian's personality are as exaggerated as the good. His self-certainty and drive break through to the point of arrogance. His&#xa0;behaviour can be erratic, and he's not particularly considerate of those around him. As his online nickname \"Mendax\" suggests, he is quite happy to lie in the interest of what he sees as the greater good.</p> <p>But the worst qualities Assange displays are not really his fault. Even before the huge storm caused by the embassy cables, he tended towards the paranoid. Imagine seeing senators, commentators and more discussing your every move, calling you a terrorist, threatening you, with that predisposition. The result is a heady mix of paranoia, a predisposition to self-interest. A willingness to manipulate the truth and a belief that what you're doing is right is a potent and dangerous mix \u2013 and it's what's been driving Assange, and the chaos that follows in his wake, for almost two years now.</p> <h2>Iain Overton, editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism<br></h2> <p>I first met Julian when he invited the Bureau to scrutinise the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq-war-logs\" title=\"\">Iraq War Logs</a>. From the start, he made an impression. He gave perhaps the most wooden statement I've ever seen to CNN and then, as the camera turned off, transformed into a&#xa0;warm, personable man.</p> <p>A man who put himself in danger by exposing the US's secrets would also take delight in attempts to protect himself. Whether it was casually taking off his bulletproof vest in a restaurant, or appearing at the Bureau's offices with dyed hair, you never knew if he actually believed these safety measures worked or were just a bit of showmanship.</p> <p>Despite being an expert in secrecy, he talks unguardedly and freely when you are alone with him. And he can show an often sensitive and playful manner. Other times \u2013 like when debating what names should be redacted from the Wikileaks data \u2013 he could be judgmental and reluctant to hear the alternative view.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/alanrusbridger\" title=\"\">Alan Rusbridger</a>, Guardian editor<br></h2> <p>In his unapproved and ghosted autobiography, Assange gives a colourful account of a marathon eight-hour meeting we had in the run-up to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-us-embassy-cables\" title=\"\">publication of the State Department cables</a>. Some of it was accurate \u2013 though I can't personally testify as to whether my eyes were, as he describes, \"rolling around the room like marbles on a pogo stick\". They may have been.</p> <p>The meeting took place in tense circumstances. The massive cache of cables, into which we had put months of work, had leaked from a former Wikileaks associate to a freelance journalist. It looked as if all our time and effort might come to nothing. And Assange was refusing to have any more dealings with the New York Times unless the paper's then editor, Bill Keller, promised to publish a front-page apology for having published a not wholly flattering profile of the WikiLeaks founder. We'd been told that Assange had begun, behind our backs, to talk to other American publishers.</p> <p>The eight hours began angrily. Assange, who had brought two lawyers with him, did a lot of shouting and accusing. The louder the shouting, the more mannered and Dickensian his language became. He repeatedly accused us of not being \"gentlemen\". My eyes may well have been rolling. I did my best to lower the temperature. He gradually went off the boil.</p> <p>We took a break and reconvened. Shouty Assange was now Strategic Assange. We would cooperate, after all. The snowy-haired Australian spoke deliberately. I remember thinking that, in a different life, he could have been a CEO or COO. He was intelligent, calm and incisive.</p> <p>All was going so well. We broke for a meal, during which he was witty and did his best \u2013 it felt as if was difficult for him \u2013 to make conversation. He was almost charming.</p> <p>And then, just as suddenly, he switched back to Shouty Assange. There was no deal. Keller must apologise. He would have nothing to do with us. It was now 1am. I rang Keller, knowing in advance what his answer would be. Assange ranted at his refusal to apologise. On his way out into the night an hour later \u2013 still no deal \u2013 he muttered a veiled threat at the Guardian's reporter who had worked most closely with him, David Leigh.</p> <p>The next morning there was a deal. I didn't have many more personal dealings with him. He disappeared from view (we later learned, to Norfolk) and communicated only sporadically through encrypted messaging until he fell silent altogether. But in that eight hours there was a microcosm of the man \u2013 in all his brilliance, paranoia, obstinacy and dysfunctional fury.</p> <h2>Peter Graham, school friend<br></h2> <p>He was a blond kid, shoulder-length hair, brought up with an alternative lifestyle. At the time, <a href=\"http://www.goolmangar-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/\" title=\"\">Goolmangar school</a> was made up of a lot of kids from dairy families and Jules was, to a degree, the odd one out. There weren't too many broken families back in the early 80s. He was not an outgoing sort of child. Didn't go out of his way to make trouble. I would say that he was always the sort of kid who stood behind. We used to play Red&#xa0;Rover and British Bulldog, and Jules was always one of the last to run.</p> <h2>Daniel Matthews, university friend<br></h2> <p>Julian and I studied mathematics at the University of Melbourne. We were both in the maths student group. It was fun, nerdy stuff. I've always found him witty, intelligent and eclectically knowledgeable. He is passionately committed to justice and the free flow of information and ideas. He has suffered great personal costs as a result.</p> <p>I've often heard it remarked in the press that Julian has some idiosyncrasies. The people who make such remarks tend not to have hung around mathematics departments very much.</p> <h2>Vaughan Smith, housed Assange&#xa0;for more than a year when he was on bail<br></h2> <p>Julian is somebody who will give you a surprising amount of time if he gets into a conversation. But other times you could walk past him and he wouldn't even know you were there because he was so transfixed with his computer. He would work late into the night. I get up early and go to bed early, but he's the opposite. A lot of people from a lot of different countries came through the hall to visit him. A couple of Australians brought rather a lot of Vegemite. He and his guests used to enjoy trying alcohol from different parts of the world. Julian would enjoy the occasional cigar, but it was difficult for him to smoke them because he had to stay in the house for fear of breaking his bail conditions.</p> <p>It wasn't always easy having him there, but I'm not attributing the difficulty to him, rather to having someone in the house all that time. And most of the complaints weren't really about Julian, they were about the people who'd come through the house to see him. There was an of average five to seven people staying at one time \u2013 people who wanted to see Julian. By giving him bail, I was therefore opening my door to a lot of other people. But we adjusted to that and we had a really good housekeeper who made it all happen. Julian did do some chores. He used to collect wood and eggs sometimes.</p> <p>I have four daughters and a son, who got to know&#xa0;Julian. He got on particularly well with my five-year-old. He used to give her sweets and things like that. I've got a photo of him cutting up a pumpkin with the girls all dressed up for Halloween. He fitted in with a family, although I&#xa0;wouldn't describe him as a family man.</p> <p>You can tease Julian, but he usually falls out with people who are themselves very strong characters. They will blame him and he will blame them.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/heather-brooke\" title=\"\">Heather Brooke</a>, journalist <br></h2> <p>The first time I met Assange, he was convinced a&#xa0;sniper was targeting him through the windows of a conference centre. A few hours later, he was happily typing in front of the same windows. I&#xa0;asked why he believed he was a target. \"I can't tell you,\" he said. Then, five minutes later, he did.&#xa0;He told me I should come to Washington DC for a press conference. Why? I can't tell you. Again, five minutes later, he told me about the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rXPrfnU3G0\" title=\"\">Collateral Murder video</a>.</p> <p>Assange attributed his drive to his first experience with power as a young man (hacking into the email of a Pentagon general). I said maybe I liked investigating politicians' expenses because that had been my first big investigation as a student. \"No, it's different when you're a young man.\" Can't women be driven the same way? \"No, they're not.\" It was a definitive statement, no supporting evidence needed.</p> <p>I followed up with requests to interview him for my book. I received florid emails such as, \"I&#xa0;will have you, Heather, of course I will. But let us be messiahs to generation WHY, not a bunch of ageing hacks looking for a pension... regards from intrigue hotel... I have more interesting adventures for you...\"</p> <p>When he suddenly turned up in London, he wanted me to put him up and act as some sort of mother surrogate. \"I have a fever. I'm not sure yet if it's going up or down,\" he told me. \"I need some mothering. Someone to make me chicken noodle soup and bring me cookies in bed.\"</p> <p>I later heard from two other women who said Assange pulled the same \"poor little lost boy\" trick on them in an attempt to finagle his way into their homes. I said that was not how I conducted interviews. He complained that I didn't have a maternal instinct, adding in drama-queen fashion: \"I have two wars to stop.\"</p> <p>I replied: \"Yeah, it's a tough life being a messiah.\" His response left me speechless: \"Will you be my Mary Magdalene, Heather? And bathe my feet at the cross.\"</p> <h2>J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmermann, friend and founder of <a href=\"http://www.laquadrature.net/\" title=\"\">La Quadrature du Net</a>, a group defending freedoms online<br></h2> <p>When we first met in 2009, Julian struck me as one of the brightest minds I had ever encountered. He has a deep understanding of technology and its importance for building better societies, where citizens are empowered rather than controlled. He has certain characteristics that you find only in very technical people and some people with Asperger's syndrome. He is very focused, and when he's in front of a computer screen it can be difficult to get his attention. He is very self-confident, which is a good quality most of the time, but is why he needs his friends sometimes to introduce some doubt into his mind. You have to learn how to argue with him and push your opinions through by being very persuasive. People criticise him for having a great ego. Of course he has \u2013 he wouldn't be doing such crazy things without a great ego \u2013 but I believe that his sense of the general interest is far greater than his ego.</p> <p>Julian is quite a nomadic person. He is used to travelling a lot, and having no physical attachments. For that reason, I imagine being in the Ecuadorian embassy will be hard for him. But in other ways he will cope fine. He has a sharp sense of humour, which can be very cynical and dark. I've seen him sleep on couches and under tables, and unless the people around him force him into the shower, he might not change his clothes for days. I do the same when I'm immersed in work that I think is more important than the smell of my armpits.</p> <p>When the Sweden story first broke, I told Julian, \"If you've done something wrong, you'll pay for what you did, but for me it won't change who you are and what you have achieved.\" With WikiLeaks he has brought global attention to whistleblowing. He has shown that digital technologies can empower people by exposing the wrongdoings of institutions. People who criticise him based on personality traits should take a better look at what he has achieved.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnpilger\" title=\"\">John Pilger</a>, journalist and friend <br></h2> <p>I've known Julian Assange from the beginning of his extraordinary struggle in London. What struck me straight away was his fearlessness, though courage is a better word. By standing up to the most rapacious forces in the world today, and telling people in many countries what the powerful say and do behind their backs, he's made enemies of a kind journalists should wear as a badge of honour, but rarely do. The jealousy and envy he attracts often come from those aware of their own collusion with power and unforgiving of one who refuses to join their incestuous club. Personally, I find him the best of company: visiting him at the Ecuadorean embassy or in long phone conversations, often in the early hours of the morning, we share a similar black humour. The other night, we mined Joseph Heller's Catch-22. I took him over the movie, along with Dr Strangelove and Borat. Given his restless energy, his spirits are remarkable in the circumstances; and he's fortunate to have the support of a group of unflagging, thoroughly impressive people, not least his mother, Christine. All power to him.</p> <h2>Sarah Saunders, friend, who put up the majority of his bail<br></h2> <p>Julian stayed at my house from Christmas of last year until he left for the embassy. If I had to choose one attribute of his, it would be that Julian is very inquisitive. His ability to ask incisive and interesting questions is compelling, and it's why he has been effective in his work.</p> <p>Julian likes food and wants to know all about what he's eating (as a chef and lifetime foodie, I like this about him, too), even if he appears to be distracted by his computer or playing with my Jack Russell when he should be at the table to eat! He is very scientific about his cooking. He made a very good poached egg, which not everyone can achieve.</p> <p>I'm a bit of a night bird, so it was no problem for me that he liked to work at odd hours. We'd chat across the dining room table doing work at 2am.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Keller\" title=\"\">Bill Keller</a>, former editor, New York Times<br></h2> <p>I've never actually met Julian Assange. All of our conversations have been telephonic \u2013 including one where he hovered like the Great and Powerful Oz, via Skype, over a stage in Berkeley where yet another panel was pondering the meaning of WikiLeaks. All of our conversations, including that one, consisted mainly of Julian scolding The New York Times and me personally for not playing by his rules, for failing to recognise the supreme righteousness of his cause, and for portraying him in our pages as a complicated and controversial figure. \"Where's the respect?\" he demanded plaintively in one call. \"Where's the respect?\"</p> <p>Short of practicing Freud without a licence, I can't pretend to reconcile the many contradictions of Julian. He is indignant at the long delays in due process afforded Bradley Manning, but unwilling to submit himself to the due process of Sweden \u2013 or the United States, should it come to that. (If it does, I firmly believe he should enjoy the full protection of the First Amendment.) A champion of free press (during his Evita moment on the balcony of Ecuador's embassy, he deplored Russia's hamhanded punishment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pussy-riot\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot</a>), he accepted a TV gig sponsored by Putin's Kremlin, and has become soulmates with the press-gagging Ecuadoran president. He is the leader of an organisation that wants to be regarded as a beacon of truth, but boasts of fabricating juvenile hoaxes.</p> <p>Perhaps the ultimate and irreconcilable contradiction, though, was his yearning \u2013 \"Where's the respect?\" \u2013 to possess both the adulation of the angry disaffected and the serious regard of the established.</p> <h2>Mark Stephens, former Assange lawyer<br></h2> <p>He has an encyclopedic knowledge \u2013 and I mean that in the true sense of the word - of current affairs. He can talk to you about any particular country of the world with as much detail and knowledge and insight into the nuances of politics and current affairs as you and I can speak about British politics. He really does get a mixed reaction from people. He a person about whom myths grow easily and perhaps over readily. There are a lot of apocryphal stories \u2013 stories like he doesn't flush the toilet or doesn't wash \u2013 all of which don't ring true to anyone who has been in close proximity.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/ken-loach\" title=\"\">Ken Loach</a>, film-maker who put up bail<br></h2> <p>I was contacted by a mutual friend when the court case arose and he was going to be arrested. I met him a couple of times and again in the embassy. He was very keen for some human contact, some conversation that wasn't about Julian Assange. We chatted about politics generally and current affairs. He's a very interesting thoughtful lad. He'd gone from house arrest to another confinement. As we went in, you could see the massed ranks of police and people watching nearby. That wasn't a figment of his imagination. He was good company. We laughed about things, shared our feelings of dismay at the way certain people you'd have expected to have stood up for him have behaved. I took him some films, one or two of mine, and some others as well. He was quite low key, relaxed&#xa0;and friendly.</p> <h2>Dr Suelette Dreyfus, author and journalist<br></h2> <p>Julian and I worked on the book Underground, which was about a group of computer hackers in the 1980s and 90s. He'd go off to research something and would dig and dig until he had unearthed even the most obscure source. I've met very few journalists who are as driven. He'd ring at midnight or 1am. He didn't own a watch. He's always been about content, not constraints. That's rare. When I was in the midst of writing a chapter, he'd call up and say: \"Don't self-censor when you write!\" It was his catch-cry. Even then, his philosophy was to get the facts out there and let the reader decide.</p> <h2>Daniel Domscheit-Berg, worked for WikiLeaks until 2010<br></h2> <p>I met Julian online in 2007. We started working together, and it went from really good to really bad over three years. We didn't agree about where we wanted to go with WikiLeaks. It was developing from an organisation supporting whistleblowers to one that has an entire secrecy agenda. But it's Julian's project \u2013 it's his idea. And he is not really good with criticism. He takes a no compromise position.</p> <p>We haven't spoken since I quit. We had a tight relationship for more than three years \u2013 I would have called it a friendship. I'm not sure if I would any more, because I'm quite disillusioned. But he stayed with me a couple of times, the longest was for two months or so.</p> <p>Julian's more than just intelligent \u2013 he's streetwise, witty. He's good at thinking about and analysing systems. And he is really dedicated. Here was someone equally willing to do whatever was necessary. But if you're really good at something, it usually means you're terrible at something else.</p> <p>We basically had to decide if a mutiny was what we needed \u2013 in order to readjust the way that WikiLeaks was developing. Or if we should quit and try to find another way to approach it. And we decided on the latter. The name of WikiLeaks is tainted now. I'll never be involved with Wikileaks again. I can't even imagine he would excuse himself. He wouldn't be in this mess if he had the capacity for saying sorry.</p> <p>Julian has been dealing with this level of attention for more than a year now. And the attention is crucial, in respect to his potential affairs with the US. Whatever happens will set a&#xa0;precedent for the freedom of the press and the internet. I'm torn, because I fully agree that he should never be extradited to the US. But the court of law is there to establish what is right and wrong, and if you have violated a law, and we're ignoring it because we're sacrificing that for a higher goal, you're opening up a Pandora's box.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/iankatz\" title=\"\">Ian Katz</a>, deputy editor, the Guardian<br></h2> <p>Referring to a heterosexual male reporter who had fallen out with him particularly badly, Julian once claimed to me that the journalist had been \"in love with me\". It was, like so many things Assange says, preposterous, but it also contained a germ of truth. Assange is one of a tiny number of people I have met \u2013 Peter Mandelson is another \u2013 whose approval it is hard&#xa0;not to crave.</p> <p>The first time I met him, he was deathly pale and racked by a tubercular cough. We spent an hour or so talking about the best ways to communicate outside the earshot of the CIA. He&#xa0;told me about encrypted phones and taught me how to create a number code. It was like being inducted into a mildly glamorous, if slightly malodorous, secret club.</p> <p>Over the following weeks we communicated mostly by encrypted internet chat. In these late-night exchanges \u2013 Julian never rose before lunchtime \u2013 he lurched between stentorian admonishments for the latest perceived failure of his journalistic collaborators (\"We are very disappointed...\") and knowing matiness. I&#xa0;remember him once, rather over-familiarly, referring to me as \"Katzy\", and wondering if he was really telling me that he'd done his research and knew that is what my oldest friends called me.</p> <p>My last face-to-face encounter with Julian was a rather surreal four-hour conversation in the Norfolk pile that became his virtual prison while he awaited extradition hearings. By now, for reasons too complicated to recount, Julian had taken against the Guardian and declared that he regarded it as a greater threat to him than the Pentagon.</p> <p>Seated under the severe gaze of several generations of previous inhabitants of Ellingham Hall, Julian delivered a rambling disquisition that displayed many of the frequently contradictory aspects of his personality. There was a thoughtful discussion of the ephemeral nature of the internet and a fiendishly complicated plan he had to fix it, a hard-headed and acute assessment of how the publication of thousands of secret diplomatic cables had gone, a few flashes of menace (one former colleague suspected of leaking had now been \"sat on\") and some eye-wateringly unsavoury references to sex.</p> <p>We parted with a peace agreement of sorts, which Julian summarised in his curiously mannered, other-worldly vernacular: \"I'm a gentleman. I won't throw the first punch.\"<br><em><br>\u2022 Interviews by Alison Rourke, Merope Mills, Liese Spencer, Charlotte Northedge and Becky Barnicoat</em></p>",

  "<p>I have just come back from&#xa0;four days at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival\" title=\"\">Edinburgh Festival</a>. I&#xa0;don't know why I&#xa0;went.&#xa0;Well, I do know why I&#xa0;went \u2013 I was invited&#xa0;to chair a panel discussing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift\" title=\"\">Jonathan Swift</a> and satire, and I&#xa0;thought \"Ooh, that sounds interesting! I'd&#xa0;like to know about&#xa0;that.\" It&#xa0;didn't occur to me&#xa0;until I was the&#xa0;far side of Carlisle on the Caledonian sleeper&#xa0;that this is the&#xa0;kind of response that should lead you firmly to a seat in the audience and not to any kind of prominent role&#xa0;in front of them.</p> <p>Like orgies, festivals of any kind require a certain temperament and certain attributes: an openness of mind, a creative and&#xa0;inquiring spirit, and an above-average tolerance for the human effluvia that inevitably accretes by the end of a long evening. I've&#xa0;always had the sense to stay&#xa0;away from orgies (and yes, actually, I was once invited to one, but I think it was&#xa0;to hold the&#xa0;coats), but it has&#xa0;taken me longer to learn about the other.</p> <p>The first time I went to&#xa0;Edinburgh, it wasn't too&#xa0;bad. I was 20 and supposed to be dishing out flyers for a friend's show. It would take me&#xa0;all morning and a&#xa0;month's worth of courage to hand out three of the buggers to&#xa0;complete strangers on&#xa0;the street, and then I&#xa0;would disappear into a&#xa0;far-flung tearoom with&#xa0;a&#xa0;pile of books for&#xa0;the afternoon and carefully return to our shared flat once her show had started and everyone had gone. There I would gingerly&#xa0;unfurl my&#xa0;sanitised plastic&#xa0;sheeting, lay&#xa0;it over several newspapers and lie down to cry-sleep until the next sunrise let me know that I&#xa0;was another day nearer home. When&#xa0;it all got too unbearable, I would hop on the train to Glasgow to visit my uncle Dan. On one of our afternoons together, he took me&#xa0;to visit Stirling Castle and \u2013 no more&#xa0;the man to shy&#xa0;away from the opportunity to confirm a national stereotype than he is&#xa0;to keep the car's engine running when there's enough of a&#xa0;slope to coast down and save thruppence-ha'penny on fuel \u2013 managed to get me in as&#xa0;an&#xa0;under-14 for half price,&#xa0;a&#xa0;triumph about which&#xa0;he still reminisces happily to this day.</p> <p>The next few visits to Edinburgh and elsewhere were less and less successful. This time, I almost gave up and came home early. I was barrelling through the streets in an absolute frothing fury. All these people! All&#xa0;this energy! All the frigging creativity round the place! I did experience one brief moment of levity when I watched someone dressed as <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Manuel+from+Fawlty+Towers&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jkgyUMn2MqKg0QWumYGIDQ&amp;ved=0CE0QsAQ&amp;biw=1760&amp;bih=925\" title=\"\">Manuel from Fawlty Towers</a> hold up a burger on a stick&#xa0;outside various restaurant windows while a man dressed as <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=basil+fawlty&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sEgyUIrbA-as0QXR54CQDw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFIQsAQ&amp;biw=1760&amp;bih=925\" title=\"\">Basil</a> bore down on him, but then&#xa0;I ran into a Japanese mime artist warming up in the side street by a theatre and was right&#xa0;back to wanting to kick something to death.</p> <p>So it's no good.

  "<p>Chris Adrian is an American paediatrician, an oncologist and a theologian, and <em>The Children's Hospital </em>could only have been written by someone who is a paediatrician, an oncologist and a theologian, as well as a skilled literary practitioner. It is a profoundly disturbing novel, suffused with a weird and unsettling poetry, that asks deep questions about healing and harming.</p> <p>Originally published in 2006, it has only just been released here, partly, one assumes, due to the success of the author's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781847081865/the-great-night\" title=\"\">2011 novel <em>The Great Night</em></a><em> </em>and his short story collection <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fantasy/9781847081858/a-better-angel\" title=\"\"><em>A Better Angel</em></a>. It is a less streamlined affair than the former, and boasts an almost manic profusion of ideas and images. In the hands of a less skilful writer, this capaciousness might be deemed a flaw; it is as if the author were uncertain that he might ever get published again and consequently was determined not to cut a single good notion. It is only because Adrian's work is so good that the reader does not feel overwhelmed.</p> <p>Like many of his peers, Adrian combines elements from genre writing (<em>The Children's Hospital </em>is by turns science-fictional, fantasy and thriller) with insights from the higher reaches of literary-theoretical speculation. This ambitious intermixture is almost the defining feature of the new generation of American literary writers, who, taking their cue from Thomas Pynchon, systematically forgo the pastel social realism of the majority of the previous generation. But however far down that route Adrian travels, the work is both emotionally and morally tethered to reality as we know it. And what could be more affecting and ethically problematic than one's duties to a sick child?</p> <p>The central figure of <em>The Children's Hospital</em> is a medical student, Jemma Claflin, who has already lost her parents, brother and significant other in variously traumatising ways. Because of these losses, her relationship with another intern, Rob Dickens, is being held slightly in check lest an admission of love bring down yet more tragedy.</p> <p>Jemma's romantic anxieties turn out to be both germane and trivial. How will their relationship cope when, unexpectedly, the world ends? Torrential rain turns into a catastrophic flood, with only the hospital surviving the deluge. It now floats over a drowned world, having been designed to do so by its mysterious and troubled architect; moreover, the hospital's central computer has just declared that it is the Preserving Angel. It has created SF replicators to produce anything you might desire (these are never really described except as misty pockets).</p> <p>Parts of the book are narrated by another angel, the Recording Angel, who has watched over Jemma all her life, and he reveals that another two angels will be coming to the hospital: the Accusing Angel, \"to remind them why they suffer\", and the Destroying Angel \"to revoke the promise of survival and redemption, and to teach them the awful truth about furious sheltering grace\". This structure provides narrative anchors to guide the reader through the horrors to come.</p> <p>Other sections are narrated by Jemma's dead brother, who we learn died in a shocking, possibly Satanically inspired suicide (the exact details of which will never leave you). Jemma's brother is an obvious candidate to take on one of the angelic roles, but there are others: a boy who hid in the hospital even though he wasn't ill; an amnesiac man they call Ishmael who is an improbable survivor of the deluge, and others it would be a shame to give away here.</p> <p>The hospital attempts to be both a new society in this new world and to function in its old ways; there are, after all, a great many extremely ill children on board. In fact, at one point, Jemma realises that they seem to have pairs of children with the same disease. It is an ark of symptoms and victims, and some of Adrian's descriptions \u2013 a girl with catheter bags hanging round her like a ball-gown, the child with too many fingers and not enough brain cells \u2013 are painful to read.</p> <p>Then there is a miracle, the \"Harrowing of the Hospital\", whereby Jemma manages to unleash some power to heal them all. It is a testament to Adrian's talent that you realise that the best possible thing happening is probably not going to be a good thing at all. The best and the weakest of humanity, the most-feared and most-hoped for things, can all be found within these pages.</p> <p>A reader with even a smattering of biblical knowledge will realise two things fairly quickly. In the Book of Genesis, God's covenant with Noah was that \"never again will a flood destroy the earth\". In the Book of Revelation, the vision of the new heaven and the new earth has the haunting phrase \"and there was no more sea\". Adrian's apocalypse is, terrifyingly, quite clearly not the Apocalypse. It implies a future, and how to deal with the future under the shadow of irreversibly, infinitely suffering children and adults, is the major theme.</p> <p><em>The Children's Hospital</em> is astoundingly good: much though I loved the smart, clever and equally moving <em>The Great Night</em> \u2013 which fused <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green\" title=\"\"><em>Soylent Green</em></a> and a terminally ill child \u2013 <em>The Children's Hospital</em> is possibly the more raggedly ambitious book, and proof that Adrian's ability is equal to his ambition.</p> <p>\u2022 Stuart Kelly's <em>The Book of Lost Books</em> is published by Polygon.</p>",
  "<p>On a curve of soft sand&#xa0;are the broad hieroglyphics made by&#xa0;seals hauling themselves above the tideline the previous night. As the sea slips away again, hundreds of these beige and brown bananas sunbathe on distant sandbanks, between ribbons of blue water.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/blakeney/\" title=\"\">Blakeney Point celebrates its centenary</a> this month. This pristine four-mile spit of shingle and sand in Norfolk is, of course, far older, but its purchase by the National Trust 100 years ago marked the beginning of a&#xa0;radical movement in Britain: instead of protecting specific species, the new environmentalists recognised that entire \"reserves\" must be created to save our wildlife. As the country's first coastal nature reserve, Blakeney was also the British birthplace of the science of ecology, the urge to understand how species relate to each other.</p> <p>There are now thousands of nature reserves in Britain, but some argue they are an anachronism in an era of climate change and global environmental catastrophe. A few reserves have been badly managed by conservation charities short on cash; others have lost the species they were established to protect. Are nature reserves the parochial product of an era when people believed wildlife was best served by shutting people out?</p> <p>The Point is about as wild as it is possible to get in southern Britain. There are no roads and it can be reached only by boat or an arduous walk along its energy-sapping shingle ridge. I&#xa0;arrive by boat, in a storm, to join its summer population of four: Eddie Stubbings and his three assistant wardens. Twenty-four hours brings sun, storms, cloud and&#xa0;a spectacular star-filled sky. The Point wakes to the busy kleep-kleep of oystercatchers and sleeps to the gurgle of the curlew. The one constant is the wind: rattling the 19th-century lifeboat house, roaring through the marram grass. If it ever drops, the thunder of the sea is said to be crying for the wind.</p> <p>The National Trust's first wardens were known as \"watchers\" and today it still seems that no wing flaps or paw pads without them knowing about it. They live in the wooden lifeboat house with telescopes, identification charts and a laptop powered by solar panels, cooking for each other each night and rising at 4am in the nesting season to protect the birds. Every sand dune and bush is inspected every day, as they record every bird, mammal, butterfly, moth and dragonfly that dashes past their binoculars and trail cameras.</p> <p>Like a celebrated person, Blakeney has lots of important letters by its name, from SSSI (site of special scientific interest) to AONB (area of outstanding natural beauty). But the Point is special because its three habitats \u2013 its flower-filled shingle ridge, its salt marshes and its sand dunes \u2013 have not been despoiled by a human hand. A third of Britain's population of Sandwich terns \u2013 more than 3,500 birds \u2013 nest on the Point, alongside Arctic, little and common terns. These graceful birds, once known as swallows of the sea, dart into the water to catch sand eels. The terns are accompanied by more than 1,100 common and grey seals, and rare plants such as matted sea lavender, sea heath and grey hair grass.</p> <p>The Point is even more famed for its migrants. Storms routinely blow migrating birds off course, and this peninsular, which resembles a withered hand on a map, is their first sanctuary. On the day I arrive, two honey buzzards and a wryneck have been swept in from Scandinavia. These are everyday rarities. \"Every now and then you get outrageous rarities from eastern Russia that have tried to migrate to Thailand and gone the wrong way,\" says assistant warden Joe Cockram. Modest creatures with exotic names such as the yellow-breasted bunting and the red-flanked bluetail attract birding obsessives from all over the country.</p> <p>All kinds of improbable beasts pitch up on the Point. A rare Sowerby's beaked whale washed up on the beach three seasons ago. A hedgehog somehow navigated across the tidal salt marshes recently and six red deer were seen swimming up Blakeney harbour. Jamiroquai's Jay Kay also touched down in his helicopter this spring. He was politely told to clear off.</p> <p>For all its well-protected nature, Blakeney is still shaped by the human world around it. As I do \"the bushes\" with the wardens, spying a hobby and a&#xa0;migrating little gull, we see the alien shrubs that have sprung up here. The tideline is strewn with plastic detritus (the wardens play high-tide challenge, daring to eat washed up packs of Hula-Hoops) and the newest incursion is a windfarm on the horizon: at night, its lights create a city on the water where once there was&#xa0;darkness. It will be hard to prove, but the birders who visit Blakeney believe the blades will cut up&#xa0;migrating birds, particularly when visibility is poor.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.histecon.magd.cam.ac.uk/envdoc/research/sheail.htm\" title=\"\">John Sheail, an environmental historian</a>, the early conception of a nature reserve was to put a fence around it. The first wardens were often former gamekeepers and instead of protecting pheasants they guarded rare birds or plants. \"It was 'keep people out' and with some justification because there was plant and egg collecting on a rapacious scale,\" says Sheail. The wardens at Blakeney still watch for egg thieves, but debates over public access are more subtle than people in or out.</p> <p>The wardens' biggest challenge is posed by a particularly fearsome six-legged creature: man (or woman) and dog. These pets may be perfectly friendly, but birds see only the predator, and even the frolicking of a distant dog will cause beach-nesting species such as ringed plovers to abandon their nests. Four years ago, dogs were banned from large swaths of the Point during nesting season, but the wardens still have clashes with dog-walkers. \"You do get a&#xa0;lot of aggro, and I can understand it,\" says warden Paul Nichols, who has worked on the Point for six summers. \"People have walked four miles in glorious isolation and suddenly they've got someone telling them what to do. I've been told to F-off a few times and threatened to be punched.\" With the National Trust determined to encourage public access to its wild places, its wardens are dutifully polite but some visitors still don't accept the ban. \"Because wildlife is declining all over, this place is becoming more and more important,\" says Stubbings. \"It's the&#xa0;time-old challenge of balancing protection of wildlife with access and&#xa0;education.\"</p> <p>John Sizer, the National Trust's Norfolk Coast property manager, admits that this protected landscape is still \"contested\". Local people understandably cherish their traditional rights to fish, go cockling, pick samphire and shoot wild fowl on the salt marshes, which is still permitted under licence, even on Blakeney. Then there are the visitors. \"People love to come to the coast and they don't think, 'Who owns this land?' There's a shift in mindset. It's owned by the nation,\" says Sizer.</p> <p>Despite the dogs, this year has gone well: the wardens were delighted to count 2,200 fledged Sandwich tern chicks. \"Their parents have flown 5,000 miles from sub-Saharan Africa for the sole purpose of rearing young. When you see they are successful, that's a good feeling,\" says Cockram. Alongside the terns have nested 110 pairs of oystercatchers and 16 pairs of redshanks, although there are constant dangers. Foxes have to be shot in the spring to stop them decimating the ground-nesting birds. Other predators must also be trapped. At the far end of the Point, the wardens find rat prints close to the ravaged carcass of a tern. \"That's your worst nightmare. Rats in the colony,\" says Nichols. \"They will have an absolute field day. It's like living next to Sainsbury's for them.\"</p> <p>Blakeney Point may be the cradle of the conservation movement, but nature reserves can seem yesterday's idea when environmentalists now promote \"landscape-scale\" conservation \u2013 ambitious projects to reconnect land, create corridors for wild animals and encourage farmers to manage all land for wildlife. The Point is actually a perfect example of conservation's changing ambitions: it adjoins the equally renowned <a href=\"http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/appeal.aspx\" title=\"\">Cley nature reserve and Cley's owner, Norfolk Wildlife Trust, is running a \u00a31m appeal</a> to buy adjoining land and create a much larger reserve. Between the <a href=\"http://www.norfolkwildlifetrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NWT</a>, the National Trust, the RSPB and Natural England, almost all of North Norfolk's coastal marshes are&#xa0;protected.</p> <p>Like many environmentalists, Stephanie Hilborne, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/\" title=\"\">the Wildlife Trusts</a>, which also <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/100\" title=\"\">celebrates its centenary this year</a>, stayed on Blakeney as a student, studying at UCL's field laboratory in the old lifeboat house. She says the founders of the first nature reserves \u2013 the likes of <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/blog/1912-2012/2012/05/16/charles-rothschild\" title=\"\">banker and naturalist Charles Rothschild</a> and Professor Francis Oliver of UCL \u2013 never believed they were the total answer. \"They were always an emergency backstop, protecting the absolute minimum, but now we have to be far more progressive. They are the core and in some areas virtually the only areas of rich biodiversity from which we can look outwards and allow nature to recover much more widely.\" In this way, the phrase \"nature reserve\" is absolutely precise. \"It's a reserve which is ready to use,\" says Hilborne, \"and now we're ready to use it.\"</p> <p>Sue Everett, an independent ecologist, does exactly this, harvesting wild flower seed from nature reserve meadows to help the restoration of wild flower meadows elsewhere. As she points out, nature reserves remain far more secure than landscape-scale schemes, which incentivise farmers to manage their land for wildlife through EU agri-environment programmes to enrich our ordinary countryside. EU programmes run on a&#xa0;10-year cycle and if commodity prices shoot up, some farmers will plough up their new meadows to make a better living. \"There's very little security for some habitats if they are outside nature reserves,\" says Everett.</p> <p>As we wander the Point before the wardens get down to the hard labour of removing the seasonal fencing that protects their terns, Cockram says the joy of his job is simply to witness \"the natural world working\". He has fierce debates with a friend who argues Britain should spend the money it devotes to domestic conservation on buying up pristine rainforest in South America because our countryside is already ruined, in relative terms. Cockram dismisses the idea that climate change makes nature reserves an irrelevance. \"Nature reserves are more important than they've ever been. Wildlife will adapt to climate change. The most important thing is to have land that is not totally destroyed by humans, then the wildlife will take the best advantage they can.\"</p> <p>Climate change may cause some nature reserves to lose valuable species (some butterflies, like many insects, will be driven to extinction in reserves that become drought-stricken), but they will retain crucial features, such as their soil structure. Reserves are treasured for their pristine soils containing stores of seeds, for instance, not found in fields that have been ploughed or sprayed with chemicals. \"Nature reserves have genuine ecological relevance. They are&#xa0;the foundation without which nature is always going to be less diverse,\" says Hilborne.</p> <p>For pragmatists, Blakeney and neighbouring Cley also demonstrate the economic value of nature reserves. North Norfolk's economy is built on the all-year-round tourism created by bird-watchers and other visitors. This was completely unforeseen by those who created these reserves. These days local people see how they prosper, but in many other parts of the country that argument is yet to be won. Hilborne likens governments' failure to grasp the economic benefit of environmental protection with rulers from the era before universal education who were slow to realise the economic boon of educating children. \"We're still very backwards to think the best thing we can do in an economic crisis is remove all planning laws and stuff the wildlife,\" she says.</p> <p>For ordinary people, nature reserves are more than a calculation of economic advantage. Only by spending time in protected places do we have a sense of how rich in birds, flowers and insects our countryside could be; without such benchmarks, we lose all sense of what we should expect, and what we can cherish. We lose all sense of the wild, and our connection to it.</p> <p>Those who regard nature reserves as a parochial irrelevance when the stressed planet is facing a perfect storm of climate change, overconsumption and rising population should travel to Blakeney Point and breathe in a world where colour comes from a different palette; where the sea and the marshes, the sea holly and the sea lavender, dance with silver and grey. Or they could read Patrick Kavanagh, the Irish poet. \"All great civilisations are based on parochialism,\" he wrote. \"To know fully even one field or one land is a lifetime's experience. In the world of poetic experience it is depth that counts, not width. A gap in a hedge, a smooth rock surfacing a narrow lane, a view of a woody meadow, the stream at the junction of four small fields \u2013 these are as much as a man can fully experience.\"</p>",
  "<p>Oslo district court and the Norwegian justice system are to be congratulated on the way they conducted the trial of the worst killer in the country's history. The court named 174 lawyers to protect the interests of Anders Behring Breivik's victims. The judges heard the autopsy reports of each of the 77 people killed in his rampage and each of the injuries sustained by the 242 wounded, the amputations and the comas they endured. Time given to the bereaved and the survivors did not come at the expense of the legal rights of Breivik, who testified for over a week. While Breivik's court appearance was all part of his meticulously prepared act of mass murder, the court held firm to its, and our, unshakeable belief in the rule of law. This was no military tribunal on Guantanamo Bay. This was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/23/opinion/at-breivik-trial-a-chance-for-norway-to-heal.html\" title=\"\">an open trial in an open society</a>.</p> <p>The court was also right to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/breivik-verdict-sane-21-years\" title=\"\"> declare Breivik sane</a>. An act which is by definition insane can be carried out by a person acting rationally, bearing full responsibility for what he did. Breivik's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/anders-behring-breivik-profile-oslo\" title=\"\">attention to detail</a> in planning the two attacks on July 22 2011 was chilling. He moved to a farm big enough to buy fertiliser for without attracting attention. But it was isolated enough to ensure the total privacy he needed to make his bomb. He had the idea of calling on ahead to the organisers of the Labour party's youth camp on the island of Ut\u00f8ya to persuade them that he was a policemen sent over to protect them in the aftermath of the bombing he had just committed in Oslo. They sent over the ferry to pick him up. The man who came off that ferry was equipped with more than just the physical means to kill. He had mentally prepared himself as a killer, desensitising himself in a year-long computer game session firing at human targets in realistic conditions over and over again. Training soldiers to kill involves overcoming a powerful resistance to killing one's own kind. Breivik was sane.</p> <p>Breivik leaves free society in Norway \u2013 he will surely never be let out again \u2013 with an enduring legacy. It is one which the country will be reminded of every July 22 for generations to come, but one with which it has yet to come to terms: it is what Breivik stood for. Breivik did more than just shatter Norway's self-image as a peaceful country, a place where it is safe to send your children to a summer camp, the home of the Nobel peace prize, the country confident enough to think it can mediate other countries' intractable problems. He made the Islamophobia of the far right impossible to ignore.</p> <p>Here Norway's record in the 13 months since the attacks is mixed. As the former prime minister Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland said, Breivik may have dampened the anti-multicultural rhetoric of the far right, but the sentiment itself <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/norway-anders-breivik-verdict-nears\" title=\"\">remains</a>. The attack has galvanised recruitment to the Labour party's youth wing, but the anti-immigrant Progress party has also steadily clawed back support. A national debate which dealt almost obsessively on the details of Breivik's attack has yet to address its political causes. For rightwing politicians and anti-immigrant websites in Norway, its very much <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/16/anders-breivik-toxic-legacy?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">business as usual</a>.</p> <p>The core of Breivik's ideology, that Islam poses a threat to Europeans and Norwegians alike, is shared by the English Defence League, by Pam Geller and Robert Spencer, America's biggest Muslim-haters, and by many others around Europe. Their rally in Stockholm to create a global \"counter-jihad\" was a flop \u2013 only 200 attended. But all the parties of the far right agree on the perceived risk of multiculturalism and view Muslim demographic change in Europe as a challenge. Racism based on biology may be being replaced by one based on culture. It is unlikely that another Breivik in the making is conditioning himself in another isolated house somewhere else in Europe, but it is not impossible. The ideas which created Breivik have yet to be confronted. That is as much a European as it is a Norwegian problem.</p>",
  "<p>A US survey published by Pew Internet last month asked the question: <a href=\"http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Future-of-Higher-Education/Overview/Introduction-and-overview-of-responses.aspx\" title=\"\">what will higher education look like in 2020</a>? We took on that very question last November in one of our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2012/jan/12/guardian-higher-education-live-chats\" title=\"\">live chats</a>, and now share the main points made by our panelists.</p> <p>On the panel were:</p> <p>Ewart Woolridge CBE, chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.lfhe.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Leadership Foundation for Higher Education</a></p> <p>Lance Fortnow, professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, <a href=\"http://eecs.northwestern.edu\" title=\"\">Northwestern University</a></p> <p>Martin Hughes, writer, <a href=\"http://theuniversityblog.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The University Blog</a></p> <p>Sean Ruston, chair, <a href=\"http://www.aldwychgroup.org/\" title=\"\">The Aldwych Group</a></p> <p>Liz Shutt. head of Policy, <a href=\"http://www.university-alliance.ac.uk\" title=\"\">University Alliance</a></p> <p>Vangelis Tsiligiris, college principal and researcher in cross-border higher education, <a href=\"http://mbscollege.academia.edu/VangelisTsiligiris/About\" title=\"\">MBS College</a></p> <p>Tamson Pietsch, lecturer in imperial history, <a href=\"http://www.brunel.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Brunel University</a></p> <p>Johnny Rich, founder, <a href=\"http://www.push.co.uk\" title=\"\">Push</a>, an independent guide to UK universities</p> <p>Joyce Canaan, professor of sociology, <a href=\"http://www.bcu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Birmingham City University</a></p> <p>The 'best bits' are grouped around the five key themes covered in the live chat, with a sixth section on trends added to highlight some of the main ideas that came out of the discussion.

Click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2011/nov/09/university-of-the-futureto\" title=\"\">here</a> to read the full live chat thread.</p> <h2><strong>Funding and finance</strong></h2> <p>MH: <strong>Students will become reliant on alternative sources for funding:</strong> Should the government withdraw funding further, or if they altered their stance on no student paying upfront and graduates only repaying once earnings go above \u00a321,000, expect not only a change in student numbers and diversity, but also an increased reliance on alternative sources. The system may not work if those sources are not available.</p> <p>SR: <strong>Employers will have to start playing a bigger funding role:</strong> We constantly hear businesses complain about graduates without the right skills sets; its time business put its money where its mouth is.</p> <p>LF: <strong>If we need to rely on industry funding for course we may lose even more control of our curriculum</strong>: In computer science, we already struggle with whether to teach courses that employers want so they can get jobs (and what Google wants is different from what Microsoft wants) or teaching them the fundamentals that will help them in the longer run. This tussle will only become more pronounced in the future.</p> <p>JR: <strong>Tax private companies, rather than students, and use that to fund universities:</strong> Hypothecate the money back to the university where the graduate studied and do away with fees. That'll encourage HEIs to run courses the labour market needs and students to do them.</p> <p>VT: <strong>HE will be shaped by the pursuit of monetary objectives, like those being promoted by the EU right now:</strong> Funding priorities will be low inflation, balanced budgets, reduction in the expenditure for 'public goods'. As we move towards an aggressive market based model in HE competition will change quality as we know it. Quality will be closer to 'value for money' and accountability.</p> <h2><strong>Distinctiveness and specialisation</strong></h2> <p>EW: <strong>Distinctiveness may become not just about what universities do but how they do it:</strong> We at the the Leadership Foundation have just finished a study of the 15 Cathedrals Group (faith-based) universities in the UK which demonstrated the importance of values in terms of the quality of the student experience, the relationship with staff and how they engage with their communities. As universities compete, establishing and communicating these values will become more important.</p> <p>MH: <strong>Some institutions may be forced to concentrate and specialise in order to effectively distinguish themselves and compete:</strong> Alternative institutions and open educational spaces provide a different view to traditional centres of learning. They may not be seen as HEIs in an official sense (yet), and may not provide formally recognised qualifications (again, yet), but it's important to see the value in people's desire to learn and form communities of research and engagement.</p> <p>JC: <strong>Must a university distinguish itself from its competition?</strong> It is a question that presumes commodification and marketisation. We should be focusing less on how distinctive a university is, what its 'USPs' [unique selling points] are, and more on what the purpose of a university is. Why should we accept that universities should be reconfigured, as they have been over the past 40 years?</p> <p>SR: <strong>Specialisation could create a two-tier system:</strong> We may see research money increasing concentrated at the Russell Group and 1994 Group, and the others forced to concentrate on teaching. This will result in a two-tier system, one that has ramifications for widening access. How long before employers become attuned to the different 'types' of university and start discriminating one or the other? Inevitably this will be a disaster for social mobility.</p> <p>TP: <strong>Universities will grapple with how to retain their credentialing role:</strong> HEIs have always, are and will continue to be, institutions that both foster knowledge and sanction forms of knowledge. But the internet has created not only a new form of knowledge, but a radical new form of access to it. The big question is: \"How will universities sanction the knowledged gained online\"?</p> <h2><strong>Student experience and widening participation</strong></h2> <p>MH: <strong>Participation shouldn't be a numbers game:</strong> One of the most important issues for the future is understanding that widening participation shouldn't be about getting a certain percentage into higher education. Widening participation should be about giving every person the right opportunities to higher learning should it be relevant and helpful to them.</p> <p>LF: <strong>There will be more virtual participation:</strong> Anyone with an Internet connection can get an incredible education essentially for free, from the point of view of accessing lectures and supplementary material. Oddly enough, this will make it harder for everyone to get a true university experience which includes a social environment and working directly with faculty and fellow students. Though it is possible social networking will also make this achievable.</p> <p>JR: <strong>Universities must engage with schools:</strong> Independent, personal contact with advisors and with information sources is critical if you want people, who have come from backgrounds with limited experience of it, to aspire to university. Even people handing out cubes of cheese in supermarkets understand that if you want somebody to invest in something you've got to give them a taste of it. Universities have a role in this.</p> <p>JC: <strong>Work within existing programmes but think outside the box:</strong> My colleague Matt Badcock and I are doing this in our <a href=\"http://insight.glos.ac.uk/tli/activities/ntf/creativehops/examples/Documents/Brief%20Matt%20%20Badcock%20Joyce%20Canaan.doc\" title=\"\">public sociology routeway</a>, taught in a dialogue-based beanbag space, and in which students are encouraged to work with progressive organisations outside. Other universities are also following these principles: Lincoln University have a concept called '<a href=\"http://studentasproducer.lincoln.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">student as producer</a>' that informs all programmes, encouraging students to be engaged in research from the beginning of their degrees.</p> <h2><strong>Leadership</strong></h2> <p>EW: <strong>What HE needs from future HE leaders:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The right kind of values-based entrepreneurs</p> <p>\u2022 Leaders who can work inclusively to develop the narrative that works for their university</p> <p>\u2022 Leaders able to inspire trust and confidence in a tough world</p> <p>\u2022 Leaders who can challenge staff to change their ways as well as support them through change</p> <p>\u2022 Wisdom to make sense of such a fast moving environment and communicate that to others</p> <p>\u2022 And above all, they need to be good at forging the right partnerships with other organisations.</p> <p>LF: <strong>Visionary leadership over management:</strong> There is a joke made by an earlier president at Northwestern that his job was to provide \"football for the alumni, sex for the undergrads and parking for the faculty\". Back then presidents could get by just by managing a university. But today and certainly in the future, a university leader has to make difficult choices and choose specific areas that their school can excel in. It takes a strong leader to sell such a vision to the faculty and students.</p> <p>TP: <strong>To maintain a sector true to its purpose, set up an alternate league table:</strong> It would factor in criteria such as the percentage of senior management that have been professors, percentage of students who are members of societies or staff-student ratio. It would require adopting a ranking logic but its also a satire and a rejection of it.</p> <h2><strong>Internationalisation</strong></h2> <p>LF:<strong> International competition will matter more to US universities:</strong> If we can't keep US universities affordable, students will start attending schools overseas. The UK and Europe have always had great universities but now we are seeing strength build up around the world as the foreign PhD students, trained at US institutions, have headed home.</p> <p>VT: <strong>Internationalisation will need to be kept in check:</strong> Global higher education is becoming more driven by market dynamics rather than academic incentives. Universities need to review why they engage with the wider world before they lose their way. A great <a href=\"http://journals.sfu.ca/liu/index.php/HLRC/article/download/41/37\" title=\"\">overview about internationalisation</a> which captures most of the contemporary issues is by Drummond Bone.</p> <h2><strong>Trends:</strong></h2> <p>MH: <strong>Higher learning won't have to change itself:</strong> The topics covered and the technologies might change, but there will remain a large amount of consistency in concepts of learning, research, and discovery. Ideas will get fine-tuned and tested, but the concepts will still be recognisable.</p> <p>VT: <strong>Research may become 'the luxury of the few':</strong> If governments continue to move away from an 'HE as public good' approach, the sector will continue to become more marketised and less research focused. Most HEIs will also embrace more business orientated approaches to generate funds for programme delivery.</p> <p>JR: <strong>Who will be the arbiter of quality?</strong> Diversity can also mean diversity of quality. Who will be there to check standards are high enough? Particularly in institutions forced to find funding by occupying parts of a diverse market that have less to spend. The shift towards diversity must be accompanied by a shift towards accountability and promotion of understanding of what universities are offering.</p> <p>JC: <strong>Some universities will challenge the assumptions that mandate change:</strong> 1. universities all aspire to be like Oxford and Cambridge. 2. League tables are inevitable. 3. University diversity is a good thing because those from diverse parts of the sector can collaborate.</p> <p>EW: We will see a huge increase in diversity of universities, and probably an ever growing demand for higher education across the world - both for teaching and research.</p> <p>TP: One of the tasks for universities in the future will be to proudly speak out for and in the language of messiness, humanness, and quite frankly inefficiency.</p> <h2><strong>Resources:</strong></h2> <p>Hussey, T. &amp; Smith, P.

  "<p>Patrick Barkham's comments on this summer's wildfires, particularly those in the American west, emphasising arson as a cause, demand rebuttal (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2012/aug/22/so-many-forests-fire-wildfires?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Shortcuts</a>, G2, 23 August). The forest fires stretching from the Great Plains to the Pacific Ocean have consumed over 10,000 square miles of forest, grasslands and homes, and are still burning. Normal wildfires in the west are nothing like this conflagration. This summer has seen the worst American drought in over 50 years and the hottest summer on record, with temperatures of over 40C . An infestation of pine beetles, not killed off in a warmer winter, left dry dead tinder throughout the forests. Add to that the effects of heat, lightning and high winds.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/\" title=\"\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, this extreme weather is almost certainly the result of global warming caused by humans. If this is the arson and vandalism to which Mr Barkham refers, each of us is responsible. One fire was caused by a couple hauling an old caravan up a mountain road. An overheated engine, tuned to sea level oxygen, tossed a spark which hit dry tinder and burned thousands of acres. Naive people not from the west, thinking they're experiencing the wilderness, don't think before hiking in and lighting campfires.But stupidity is not the same as arson. Twelve people have died in these fires including a 20-year-old firefighter when a burning tree fell on her last week.<br><strong>Susan Wolfe</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p>\u2022 Many of the wildfires throughout Spain are due to a policy over many years, especially during the Franco era, of replacing native oak forests with close-planted pines and eucalyptus, which burn like matchwood. The native cork and holm oaks have thick bark which is an excellent insulator and fire resistant. These forests still represent the largest areas of woodland in Europe, act as a barrier against the desertification of the peninsula, support the sustainable cork (harvested from the bark without harming the trees) and serrano ham (from the acorns eaten by free range pigs) industries, and act as havens for threatened wildlife such as the Iberian Lynx and the Spanish Imperial Eagle. <br><strong>Denis O'Connor</strong><br><em>Otley, West Yorkshire </em></p>",
  "<p>Local authorities will not only have&#xa0;responsibility&#xa0;for the social fund from April 2013 (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/councils-invest-food-banks-welfare-cuts?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Breadline Britain: councils fund food banks to plug holes in welfare state</a>, 22 August) \u2013 they will also,&#xa0;thanks to the local government finance bill,&#xa0;have to implement&#xa0;a local&#xa0;council tax benefit which is to apply to people the council considers to be&#xa0;in financial need. There is nothing in the bill to prevent councils deciding to give vouchers for local food banks to meet&#xa0;financial&#xa0;need. They are already issued by jobcentres, Citizens Advice bureaux and some charities. Food banks can provide a little low-level nutrition in a crisis for three days, but were never designed to cope with months of malnutrition due to an inadequate level of incomes or benefits. &#xa0;</p> <p>No guidance about financial need will be issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government, whose ministers, along with every member of the cabinet, have abdicated the primary moral duty&#xa0;of a civilised government for ensuring their poorest fellow citizens have enough income to buy a healthy diet. This moral lacuna damages the economy: it creates massive costs for the health service and lost time at work. Nutritionists frequently remind us that Britain was better fed from 1940 to 1945, a time of war and far greater economic crisis than the present.<br><strong>Rev Paul Nicolson</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Taxpayers-Against-Poverty/299911526728884\" title=\"\"><em>Taxpayers Against Poverty</em></a></p> <p>\u2022 Your report is a stark illustration of the reality of food poverty in Britain. Unfortunately it is a reality that the government refuses to wake up to and accept responsibility for. In January when I questioned Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs minister Richard Benyon about food poverty, he claimed it was \"ridiculous to say that the rise in the need for food banks is attributable to this government\". However, in my constituency of Liverpool Wavertree the number of people accessing food banks has doubled in the last six months. More than 40% of people say their main reason for using the service is delay in receiving their benefits, often when their circumstances change.</p> <p>The increasing need for food banks is a damning indictment of this government's failed economic approach.<br><strong>Luciana Berger MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Liverpool Wavertree </em></p> <p>\u2022 News that councils are to fund food banks is an indictment of government policy and surely shames us all. Since 1945, the welfare state has protected us from falling below an essential threshold of decency due to age, infirmity or circumstances. Austerity is tearing holes in that safety net. Those paying the price include children, the unemployed, and people in low-paid work who earn too little to make ends meet. These conditions are distressing and humiliating for those who endure them.</p> <p>It is time to debate the introduction of a legal duty on government to ensure an adequate standard of living. Such a duty, to which the UK is already committed through international treaties, would not mean that individuals could pursue the state for housing or benefits unreasonably. It would commit the government to deploy resources towards providing a minimum threshold of food, clothing, shelter and social security. This includes generating sufficient revenue to fund essential services and regulating markets to serve social goals.</p> <p>The government has set up a commission to explore whether the UK should have a new bill of rights. If we are truly committed to our welfare state, why not enshrine that in law?<br><strong>Kate Green MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Stretford and Urmston</em></p> <p>\u2022 So poor people don't look after their health&#xa0;(<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/23/class-divide-health-widens-thinktank?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Class divide in health widens</a>, 23 August).

It's also well known that health inequities \u2013 inequalities is not the correct word \u2013 increased in the 90s alongside income inequality.&#xa0; The solution is not proselytizing for \"improved lifestyle\" but a massive reduction in the disparity in income, living conditions and opportunity in this country.<br><strong>Neil Blackshaw</strong><br><em>Little Easton, Essex</em></p>",

  "<p>Shinji Kagawa is \"confident of great outcomes\" for Manchester United this season despite Sir Alex Ferguson's side losing their opening Premier League match at Everton 1-0.</p> <p>Kagawa, who was United's standout outfield player in Monday's defeat, wrote on his Facebook page: \"Four days ago one of my dreams finally came true. Playing what I love to do in the Premier League.

  "<p><strong>Zoe Wood</strong></p> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer was the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, after it was reported to be on the shopping list of a US private equity firm.</p> <p>CVC Capital Partners, which tried to buy Sainsbury's in 2007, had explored a bid for the struggling high-street chain, according to the report by Bloomberg, although its sources added that the buyout firm was not actively pursuing a bid at present. Both CVC and M&amp;S declined to comment but the speculation sent the shares up nearly 4% to 370.5p, with M&amp;S the most actively traded stock in the index.</p> <p>Analysts say M&amp;S is increasingly vulnerable to a bid after a string of disappointing sales updates. Some investors are beginning to lose faith in chief executive Marc Bolland's ability to revive the 128-year-old chain. The retailer reported its first decline in profits for three years in May, as even its older and more affluent shoppers felt the chill of recession in Britain. That setback was followed by a double whammy in July when dire first-quarter sales were compounded by the departure of long-serving clothing supremo Kate Bostock, by \"mutual consent\". Like-for-like sales of clothing and homewares had tumbled nearly 7% \u2013 the worst performance in at least three years.</p> <p>At its annual results, Bolland rowed back on a three-year plan to boost UK group sales by up to \u00a32.5bn, and put the brakes on plans to open more stores. The UK's biggest clothing retailer also revealed its share of the key womenswear market had dropped from 10.9% to 10.4%. Analysts said M&amp;S clothing brands were not distinct enough \u2013 it has since hired Belinda Earl, former chief executive of Debenhams, who is credited with establishing the Designers at Debenhams ranges.</p> <p>The last time M&amp;S was in play was in 2004, when Topshop owner Sir Philip Green made a second attempt to buy the high-street institution. At that time, Sir Stuart Rose was parachuted in to defend the business, and Green's's \u00a39.1bn offer ultimately failed to garner sufficient support from shareholders.</p> <p>Last month, Paul Mumford, a fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, said M&amp;S was \"vulnerable\" to a takeover bid, pointing to the depressed share price coupled with the attractiveness of the brand and its food business.</p> <p>Any buyer would need deep pockets, however, as it remains hard to raise the debt required to underpin any deal: M&amp;S has a market value of \u00a35.7bn and debts of nearly \u00a32bn as well as substantial pension liabilities, so any buyer would have to write a cheque for more than \u00a37bn.</p> <p>M&amp;S's share price dropped 15% between the start of April and mid-July but has since been ticking up as rumours circulate about its future.</p> <p>Any bidder would face a formidable opponent in Robert Swannell: the M&amp;S chairman has a 30-year career in investment banking behind him.</p> <p>CVC was forced to abandon its \u00a310bn offer for Sainsbury's after members of the founding family as well as its pension trustees opposed plans to sell property assets.

The only way to prevent a catastrophic oil spill happening in this unique environment is to permanently ban all drilling now,\" said Naidoo.</p> <p>Gazprom Neft Shelf, the Gazprom subsidiary that holds the licence for the field, said the Greenpeace activists were invited to come on board for a \"constructive dialogue\" but they declined. The campaigners later called off the protest.</p> <p>Russia has long had ambitions to produce lots of oil and gas from the Arctic and has recently signed Arctic agreements with western firms such as ExxonMobil to kickstart the campaign. The Prirazlomnaya \u2013 a steel structure, part of which was used previously to produce oil on the Hutton field in the UK North Sea \u2013 is an all-Russian pioneering venture that hopes to start producing hydrocarbons from next summer.</p> <p>Some of the estimated 526million barrels of oil in the field would be loaded on to tankers in the Arctic and carried back to Murmansk or perhaps direct to petroleum centres such as Rotterdam.</p> <p>Greenpeace, which has confronted other Arctic drillers such as Cairn Energy off Greenland and is trying to stop Shell working off Alaska, has put the far north at the centre of its current campaigning.</p> <p>It recently claimed that Gazprom's oil spill response plan for the platform had expired and says any drilling without a new plan in place would be illegal.</p> <p>But the Kremlin has recently announced plans to crack down on \"foreign\" non-governmental organisations and the court sentences against Pussy Riot female punk and protest band indicate Russia is in no mood for internal or outside criticism.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron is to revive a tradition championed by Margaret Thatcher and John Major by revamping the government whips' office to give it greater authority over the parliamentary party.</p> <p>In one of the major elements of next month's ministerial reshuffle \u2013 which will also see the return of the Liberal Democrat David Laws to the government \u2013 the prime minister is to heed the advice of party elders and clear out much of the current whips' office to make it a training ground for future cabinet ministers.</p> <p>Cameron held preliminary consultations with aides in Downing Street this week before resuming his holiday in Cornwall on Saturday. He will embark on his first substantial ministerial reshuffle early next month. It is likely to entail the departure of a handful of cabinet ministers, notably the Welsh secretary, Cheryl Gillan and the leader of the Commons, Sir George Young.</p> <p>The changes are likely to see the end of Patrick McLoughlin as chief whip. He is expected to leave the cabinet, which he attends as a non-voting member. It is understood that if McLoughlin goes it will be of his own volition. Former miner McLoughlin has served continuously in the Tory whips' office for 17 years, and is held in high personal regard by the prime minister.</p> <p>Caroline Spelman, the environment secretary, is seen as vulnerable, though she may hold on for another year. Baroness Warsi is facing an intense campaign for her removal as Tory co-chair. If she leaves that post she is expected to remain in the cabinet in another role.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the employment minister who missed out on a cabinet place after the formation of the coalition, is expected to be promoted. Maria Miller, the minister for disabled people, who was brought up in south Wales, is being lined up to replace Gillan. Michael Fallon, the Tory deputy chairman, is expected to be rewarded for his work fire-fighting on behalf of the government on the airwaves with a promotion to chief whip, party chairman or leader of the house.</p> <p>There are expected to be changes within the cabinet. Kenneth Clarke is fighting hard to avoid a demotion from justice secretary to replace Young as leader of the Commons. Jeremy Hunt is widely expected to be moved from his post as culture secretary.</p> <p>The reshuffle will mainly focus on the Tories, with few Liberal Democrat ministers. Laws, who left the government under a cloud after a row about his expenses just 17 days after the coalition was formed, will, however, return to ministerial office.</p> <p>The prime minister is running the reshuffle in a tight four-strong unit. Other members include George Osborne, the No 10 chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, and Llewellyn's deputy, Kate Fall. William Hague, the foreign secretary, and McLoughlin are also being consulted. Nick Clegg has a free hand over Liberal Democrat appointments and will be consulted on Tory changes.</p> <p>Senior government sources say there will be significant cabinet changes. \"This will not be tinkering,\" one source said.</p> <p>But the prime minister is understood to have no current plans to replace or move any of the cabinet's heavy hitters: Osborne, Hague and the home secretary, Theresa May. Cameron is resisting calls on his benches to remove Osborne as chancellor and either appoint him party chair or ask him to swap with Hague.</p> <p>Tory MPs are becoming increasingly critical of Osborne, who is struggling to explain how he is fulfilling his two main pledges: the elimination of the structural budget deficit before the next general election and an economic recovery led by a revived private sector. One normally loyal Tory said: \"George Osborne embodies the privilege and complacency of this government. He is not the right person to say we are all in this together. He is the little lord of privilege. If the prime minister does not replace him he is only delaying the inevitable by a year.\"</p> <p>The prime minister has accepted the advice of party elders who believe he has fallen into the same trap as Tony Blair by underestimating the importance of the whips' office. Cameron, who made a point of hugging McLoughlin at the last meeting of the 1922 Committee, is not critical of his chief whip, who is seen as having done a difficult job in trying circumstances as Tory MPs showed their unease at the coalition by rebelling against the government.</p> <p>It is understood that Cameron now agrees that the whips' office will have a greater chance of asserting authority over troublesome MPs, particularly the 2010 intake, if it combines two sorts of MPs: respected older figures and newcomers destined for the cabinet.</p> <p>One government figure said: \"There is a desire to turn the whips' office back to what it used to be under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. It will be turned into an office that combines experienced MPs who are never likely to be ministers but who provide ballast with the other half drawn from the ranks of young MPs who are heading up the ranks.</p> <p>\"It will be a bit like a business management college for the younger whips. They will learn a hell of a lot about business management, parliamentary procedure. The whips' office produces a group cohesion \u2013 once a whip, always a whip \u2013 and teaches you about the realities of life.\"</p> <p>The old guard are lobbying Downing Street to send the likes of Matthew Hancock, Osborne's former chief of staff, and Nick Boles, the polished policy wonk, to be trained under the influence of senior figures in the whips' office. \"From behind the arras Matt Hancock will don some form of official gold braid,\" one source said.</p> <p>The presence of such high flyers would revive memories of Lord Wakeham, Thatcher's legendary chief whip, who famously said that he expected his junior whips to be in the cabinet within 10 years. One of his charges exceeded this target. Major made the cabinet in 1987, four years after his appointment as a whip and became prime minister in 1990, seven years after joining Wakeham's whips' office.</p> <p>Some of the current whips will prosper in the reshuffle. There is strong pressure for the prime minister to appoint the popular Philip Dunne, a successful businessman, to the Treasury or the business department. But others, such as Michael Fabricant, are expected to head to the back benches.</p>",
  "<p>\"If you like anchovies on your pizza you'd better be careful,\" warns Mark Livingston, investment director of Fidelity Worldwide Investment.</p> <p>You would not expect the head of a global asset fund managing \u00a3138bn of pensions and investments to care about the cost of pizza toppings. But the global nature of the food chain means severe storms off the coast of Peru have led to a dramatic jump in the price of the oily fish \u2013 which will in turn lead to a spike in Scottish farmed fish, Chinese pigs and even Omega 3 tablets in Holland &amp; Barratt.</p> <p>\"That's the nature of today's food business \u2013 everything's connected,\" Livingston says. \"If you can catch some anchovies you'll make some serious money.\"</p> <p>And that's why Livingston cares about this silvery-coloured fish. Three years ago Fidelity spotted the growing importance of the \"forgotten fish\" and invested in Copeinca, a Norwegian company that owns a fleet of 30 Peruvian anchovy fishing boats and five processing plants across the country.</p> <p>Just a few years ago no one outside of the fish oil industry really paid much attention to anchovies and they were lumped together with other unloved fish under the unappetising label \"industrial fish\".</p> <p>\"It covers all the stuff we don't consume directly. We caught 18m tonnes of industrial fish last year, which represents 20% of all fish caught worldwide,\" says Gorjan Nikolik, associate director of animal protein at Rabobank.</p> <p>These fish are caught in massive quantities, dried, minced and ground down into fish meal [a brown powder made mostly from fish bones and fish offal] and fish oil [which is extracted from the tissues of oily fish].</p> <p>\"After two years of declining prices, fish meal and fish oil are becoming expensive again. And people are now paying attention,\" says Nikolik from his office in Utrecht, the Netherlands' fourth city.</p> <p>He says the price of fish oil has increased from $1,500 (\u00a3950) a tonne at the beginning of the year to $2,000 per tonne this month; fish meal has jumped from $1,300 a tonne to a record $1,700.</p> <p>The price is rising due to the growth in farmed fish [mostly salmon and prawns], which feed on them, and the substitition of fish meal as animal feed because corn has become too expensive: the corn price has hit a record high as a result of the severe drought in the US.</p> <p>Fish oil has soared even further because a new consumer has emerged: humans. \"Direct consumption in the form of Omega 3 pills has increased to 14% [of the global fish oil production] from 2%-3% five years ago,\" says Nikolik.</p> <p>Peruvian anchovy fishermen \u2013 and their investors \u2013 are the biggest beneficiary of the fish oil spike because, Livingston says, \"the Peruvian anchovy is the best fish in the world to produce fish oil as they have the most calories\".</p> <p>The anchovy price [which is not available separately but calculated from the fish oil price] has increased still further because since 2009 the Peruvian government has imposed quotas on the number of anchovies that can be caught in their waters. \"They've limited the supply, which will all know lifts the price.\"</p> <p>Additionally, unusually severe Pacific storms have made anchovies much harder to catch. \"The strange weather patterns have made the sea more turbulent and less people are willing to go out into the sea \u2013 which increases the cost of fishing.\"</p> <p>\"And on top of that,\" Livingston adds pausing for breath. \"There's this push into organic fertiliser.\" Fish meal will pass an approved organic feed, as consumers increasingly demand food that hasn't been plied with chemical fertiliser.</p> <p>In any ordinary year the soaring price of fish oil and meal should force up salmon prices, Nikolik says. But this is no ordinary year. This year salmon have been hungry.</p> <p>\"In 2012 the water temperature has been a couple of degrees warmer in the north Atlantic than normal. This has had a big affect on the appetite of salmon, which has led to a record growth rate.\"</p> <p>Norway, the world's biggest salmon farmer ahead of Chile and Scotland, only expected a 5% increase in the salmon crop this year but global salmon production is already up 30% in the first half of the year. Chile's salmon fisheries are also recovering from a disease that forced them to kill 75% of the stock two years ago.</p> <p>\"This has led to a dramatic price drop of 35-40%,\" he says. \"Last year salmon was changing hands at 38-43 Norwegian kroner per kilo, it's crashed to 25 kroner.\"</p> <p>Nikolik says the salmon industry has not been subject to such a steep price change since the fish farming industry took off in the 1970s and 80s.</p> <p>The price collapse has translated into cheaper prices and promotions in supermarkets across the world.</p> <p>\"It is a great deal for consumers and producers,\" he says. \"The prices are so low that new people are trying salmon \u2013 and if they get hooked producers will have new customers. It's like a year-long special promotion.\"</p> <p>Nikolik says prices have been so depressed that even hard-pressed consumers have taken to eating more of a once exclusively upmarket fish. European salmon consumption in the first half of the year is up to 419,00 tonnes from 342,000 tonnes last year. \"We've seen growth in Portugal, Greece, Spain \u2013 places where you would expect recession to have reduced demand.\"</p> <p>The fast-developing Bric nations are also increasingly keen on salmon. Industry figures show Russian salmon consumption is up 67% to 75,000 tonnes in the first six months of the year, while Latin Amercia (particularly Brazil) is up 85%, even China which does not have a tradition of eating fish fillets has seen salmon consumption rise by 34%.</p> <p>While salmon is leaping, its more down-to-earth cousin mackerel is plunging. A diplomatic dispute between Iceland and the Faroe islands against the EU, Ireland and Norway has led to severe overfishing of north Atlantic mackerel stocks.</p> <p>Simon Coveney, Ireland's agriculture minister, has accused Iceland of making a \"financial killing\" from fishing mackerel in defiance of a EU-agreed quota.</p> <p>Iceland claims that rising sea temperatures have led to a \"dramatic change\" in mackerel's migration route into its territorial waters. \"We've seen 1.1m tonnes of mackerel in Icelandic waters in 2012, 2011 and 2010, compared to very little in 2006 and 2005,\" says Friirik Arngr\u00edmsson, head of the Federation of Icelandic Fishing Vessel Owners. \"The mackerel is feeding here and increasing its weight here \u2013 we have a right to fish our mackerel.\"</p> <p>The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices), which advises governments on fish quotas, has counselled landing not more than 630,000 tonnes of mackerel. Iceland says the EU and Norway have allocated themselves 90% of that catch.</p> <p>\"That leaves 10% to Iceland, the Faroes and Russia \u2013 that's not a fair share,\" argues Arngr\u00edmsson. \"We cannot accept that the EU can decide whether or not we should fish mackerel. They have claimed that it is their fish, but it is also our fish.\"</p> <p>While Arngr\u00edmsson admits that until recently Iceland regarded mackerel as only a bycatch to herring, he strongly refutes the suggestion that Iceland has only started to bother catching mackerel since its financial system went into meltdown in 2008. \"There is absolutely no link between the Icelandic banks and the mackerel. It is just a coincidence that the mackerel has migrated into Icelandic waters.\"</p> <p>Back on dry land, drought in the US has wiped out 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop in the worst harvest since 1988. As well as leading to the soaring price of those commodities [corn is up 64% since June] it has also caused a spike in all other cereals and animal feeds, including wheat, hay and fish meal [which is increasingly used to feed China's growing demand for pork].</p> <p>Many cattle farmers are no longer able to afford to feed their cows and the US herd has shrunk to its smallest since 1973. Cattle prices have risen by 8.5% to $1.35 a pound.</p> <p>Fast-food chain Wendy's has already warned it will be forced to raise the price of burgers. The real losers will be the world's poorest. \"If the current food price rises continue it will lead to food inflation, which will be very bad for poor countries,\" says Livingston. \"It doesn't matter where prices are rising, it is always the poorest people that suffer most because food makes up a much bigger part of their outgoings. We can afford to absorb the rise \u2026 \"</p> <p>He warns that if prices keep going up it will become a food crisis that could match the severity of the 2008 food riots that helped spark the Arab spring.</p> <p>While most dread the repeat of such a crisis some of the multimillionaires that control the global food market are anticipating the opportunity to make vast profits.</p> <p>The head of Glencore's food trading business this week said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/21/glencore-us-drought-good-for-business\" title=\"\">the food crisis would be \"good\" for business</a>.</p> <p>Chris Mahoney, the trader's director of agricultural products, who owns about \u00a3500m of Glencore shares, said: \"The environment is a good one. High prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage [the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from price differences in different markets] opportunities.</p> <p>\"We will be able to provide the world with solutions\u2026 and that should also be good for Glencore.\"</p> <h2>Orange juice</h2> <p>Orange juice prices surged 14% this week as a tropical storm is expected to strike Florida, the world's second-biggest producer after Brazil.</p> <p>The price of orange juice, which has this year swung from record highs of $2.2 a pound to near-record lows, hit $1.40 this week as tropical storm Isaac was heading directly for the southern US state.</p> <p>However, Judith Ganes-Chase, president of J. Ganes Consulting, a commodity trading company, warned that the price will fall again as there is falling demand.</p> <p>Tea prices are also on the up, with some varieties soaring by more than 40% so far this year. William Gorman, chairman of the UK Tea Council, said strong demand from India and China was causing the surge. Climate change is alsoharming some previously excellent tea growing regions.</p> <p><strong>Lionel Badal</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Lance Armstrong was never one for giving up. The champion cyclist overcame life-threatening testicular cancer to win the Tour de France seven times and put the race on the map in the US. He did more than most athletes for charity in building a global foundation helping millions of cancer survivors. He went mountain biking with former US president George W Bush and even talked of running for governor of Texas. To cap it all, Armstrong once dated a rock singer, Sheryl Crow.</p> <p>But no matter how hard he pedalled, protested or dissembled, he could not shake off the tide of doping accusations that pursued him for years and have now overwhelmed a man once regarded by millions as a sporting hero. Late on Thursday, he finally did what he rarely has in the past and abandoned the fight.</p> <p>Armstrong, 40, announced he would no longer challenge an investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) into allegations that every one of his Tour de France victories from 1999 to 2005 was tainted by the use of banned substances such as the blood-booster EPO and steroids, as well as blood transfusions, testosterone and cortisone. With that he killed the myth of one of the most inspirational figures in world sport.</p> <p>Usada on Friday banned him from competition cycling for life and stripped him of his Tour de France titles. The cyclist said the agency does not have the power to do that and the issue is likely to end up being fought out before the cycling authorities and private company that run the Tour.</p> <p>\"There comes a point in every man's life when he has to say: 'Enough is enough.' For me, that time is now,\" he said. \"I have been dealing with claims that I cheated and had an unfair advantage in winning my seven Tours since 1999. The toll this has taken on my family and my work for our foundation and on me leads me to where I am today \u2013 finished with this nonsense.\"</p> <p>The move came after a US court ruled against Armstrong's attempts to block Usada's investigation. He consistently maintained he never failed a test for banned substances, although that is disputed. But Usada said its investigation revealed a systematic programme of drug misuse in Armstrong's team and claimed 10 of the cyclist's former team mates would testify that he was at the heart of it. The agency also told Armstrong it has blood samples from two and three years ago that are \"fully consistent\" with illegal doping.</p> <p>Although Armstrong has a solidly loyal band of followers who believe his claim to be the victim of a witch hunt and \"outlandish and heinous claims\", his withdrawal from the case was widely interpreted as an admission of guilt \u2013 albeit of a crime in a sport that was saturated in illegal drug use at the time.</p> <p>Bicycling magazine greeted the news with the headline \"The Truth Hurts\" on its cover. Its editor, Peter Flax, said the case against Armstrong was overwhelming. \"In my mind there's no doubt that these activities transpired,\" he said. \"But he's also an inspiration to millions.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuDet_-Dopage.-La-chute-de-Lance-Armstrong-Bernard-Hinault-s-en-fout-eperdument-_39382-2106651_actu.Htm\" title=\"Dopage. La chute de Lance Armstrong, Bernard Hinault sen  fout perdument \">Bernard Hinault, the French five times winner of the Tour de France, told ouest-france.fr</a>: \"This is a problem that should have been sorted out 10 or 15 years ago but which never was.\"</p> <p>Jan Ullrich, a German former rider who was three times runner-up to Armstrong \u2013 and has faced doping allegations of his own \u2013 said: \"I've ended my career and I have always said that I'm proud of my second places. It doesn't really bother me that much.\"</p> <p>Usada's chief executive, Travis Tygart, called Armstrong's move sad but said it was hailed an important step toward ending cheating in sport which costs honest athletes their place on the podium. \"This is a heartbreaking example of how the win-at-all-costs culture of sport, if left unchecked, will overtake fair, safe and honest competition.\" But for clean athletes, it is a reassuring reminder that there is hope for future generations to compete on a level playing field without the use of performance-enhancing drugs,\" he said John Fahey, the head of the World Anti-doping Agency, said Armstrong's decision not to fight the charges anymore was an admission of guilt and he should be stripped of his victories.</p> <p>\"He had the right to rip up those charges but he elected not to, therefore the only interpretation in these circumstances is that there was substance in those charges,\" he told Reuters. \"My understanding is that when the evidence is based upon a career that included seven Tour de France wins then all of that becomes obliterated.\" Usada could alsogo after Armstrong's millions of dollars in winnings.</p> <p>His climbdown leaves in its wake the wreckage of a career now widely accepted to have been built on a lie, and raises questions over the future of his sporting legacy.</p> <p>The loss of his Tour de France titles is also likely to harm the race's reputation. The damage is also likely to extend to Livestrong, the foundation Armstrong created after he survived his battle with cancer. It has raised about $500m (\u00a3316m) to fight the disease and help other survivors. Millions of people at one time or another bought a Livestrong yellow bracelet in support of the charity, and its jerseys were popular at US sporting events \u2013 particularly triathlons, which Armstrong took up after retiring from professional cycling last year.</p> <p>Armstrong's sponsors, which have paid a total of about $10m a year, will be embarrassed and some are likely to drop him although his principal backer, Nike, said it would stand by the shamed athlete. \"Lance has stated his innocence and has been unwavering on this position. Nike plans to continue to support Lance and the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a foundation that Lance created to serve cancer survivors,\" it said.</p> <p>Among the adverts Armstrong made for Nike was one in which he toyed with the doping allegations: \"Everyone wants to know what I'm on. What am I on? I'm on my bike busting my ass six hours a day.\"</p>",
  "<p>With Syria's second city, Aleppo, consumed by violence, war has returned with a vengeance to its capital. But in Damascus, the regime, rather than rebel groups, is on the attack. The summer offensive that rebel leaders envisaged is, so far, not going to plan.</p> <p>Nationwide, the intensity of violence and number of dead and wounded is now at its highest level since the uprising began more than 18 months ago. Western officials, activists and rights groups estimate that close to 5,000 people have died during the past month alone. \"It was a good Ramadan for the regime,\" said one western official. \"If you can call 5,000 dead people good.\"</p> <p>In Aleppo, savage fighting along several front lines is claiming around 30-60 victims per day, including government soldiers. The city looks and feels abandoned. Most citizens who live in the rebel-held eastern half have either left, or have bunkered down in their homes, where few supplies are reaching them from regime-held areas to the south.</p> <p>Siege is crippling the opposition areas of the city. And a well-chronicled withering rain of shells from tanks and jets is wearing down both fighters and the few residents who have remained.</p> <p>As Aleppo has been burning, however, Damascus has also re-ignited, but with much less attention.</p> <p>The rebel insurrection in the capital, which struck fear into the heart of the regime from 18 July, with the killing of three security chiefs, was put down by loyalist forces around 10 days later, and does not at present appear to have lived up to expectations.</p> <p>The assault on the capital had led to large numbers of desertions and defections and sharply bolstered rebel morale in other areas of the country, especially in Aleppo where the charge was led by forces who had rapidly ousted loyalists from security bases in the hinterland.</p> <p>For the first time since the start of the uprising, the regime had appeared rattled. Its inner sanctum, watertight for four decades, started to creak and the number of defectors or deserters from Syria's 300,000-strong army is believed by Turkish and western observers to have topped 50,000.</p> <p>Since then attacks on rebel strongholds in Damascus have intensified and the opposition's capacity to counter them seems to have tapered off.</p> <p>\"We don't know what's going on in Damascus,\" said one rebel leader in Aleppo this week. \"All we know is that there's a big fight happening here.\"</p> <p>While rebel forces have shown more of an ability to co-ordinate operations \u2013 the summer offensive on the two leading cities is a case in point \u2013 they remain unable to make effective use of the officers who held command and control positions in the regime army and who have since sided with them.</p> <p>\"These officers cross the border into Turkey and then we don't see them again,\" said Sheikh Tawfiq Abu Sleiman, who commands a Free Syria Army unit in northern Aleppo. \"They never come back to the battlefield to join us. And even if they did, many people here would not accept them.\"</p> <p>Neither are defecting soldiers on the Aleppo battlefield being used as reinforcements. \"They go to Turkey,\" said Radwan Surmeidi, a rebel who had just received three regime defectors last weekend. \"They don't join us straight away. And maybe never.\"</p> <p>The rebel forces' inability to receive reinforcements is not helping them against a standing military that continues to outman and outgun them. Nor are new weapons coming their way, after the flush of guns and bombs taken in raids on regime depots abandoned by fleeing forces in late-July.</p> <p>A trickle of assault weapons and ammunition comes over the border from Turkey, with the help of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkish intelligence officials. However, the heavy weapons that rebel leaders have been calling for, especially anti-aircraft guns, have not arrived.</p> <p>The few anti-aircraft guns that opposition forces do have in Aleppo are strapped to the back of utility trucks. And there has to be a good reason to fire them. On Monday, as a Syrian air force helicopter lumbered into range over the suburb of Saif al-Dawli, one such gun truck was driven out from under a shed into the middle of an intersection.</p> <p>The gunner strapped to a seat let fire with a short burst, and the truck then retreated. \"We don't have the ammunition to fire any more,\" he said. The helicopter banked to the east and flew away.</p> <p>In Damascus, the lack of weapons to combat tanks and jets is also seriously limiting the rebel campaign. Even more troubling for opposition supporters, though, is the intensity of the regime assault on areas that had not long ago been considered rebel strongholds.</p> <p>\"Everyone is being arrested, or killed,\" a resident of the Damascus suburb of Midan told the Guardian. \"There was a time when the regime made a distinction between residents and gunmen. Now they treat everyone as one and the same.\"</p> <p>At least three areas of Damascus endured their 10th consecutive day of heavy shelling on Friday. The town of Zabadani to the west of the city was pounded by artillery and tanks for a 12th straight day. Rights groups reported several dozen bodies on Damascus streets on Friday, all of which seemed to be the product of executions.</p> <p>\"Assad wants a battle in Damascus now,\" said Wissam Tarif from the global campaigning group, <a href=\"http://www.avaaz.org/en/\" title=\"\">Avaaz</a>. \"They know that the FSA has been storing weapons in Damascus. The level of provocation is intensive. It has been non-stop for the past nine days day and night. They are killing people at checkpoints. They want the FSA to overstretch themselves. They want to test their resolve. The borders from Lebanon are completely locked down now so all the reinforcements need to come from the north.</p> <p>\"They have opened two battles and they think they have the FSA's measure.\"</p> <p>With fighting also continuing to rage in Syria's other cities of Homs, Hama, Idlib and Deir Azzor, the Syrian army too would appear to be at risk of overstretch.</p> <p>However, Aleppo and Damascus remain the key battlegrounds for both sides.</p> <p>\"When we win Aleppo we will go to Damascus,\" claimed the rebel leader Sheikh Tawfiq. \"And if they lose Damascus they can't send anyone else to fight us here.\"</p>",

Adjusted American box-office records show that four of the top 100 most successful films have a biblical theme: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/78730/ten-commandments\" title=\"\">The Ten Commandments</a> (1956), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76516/ben-hur\" title=\"\">Ben-Hur</a> (1959), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/95219/robe\" title=\"\">The Robe</a> (1953) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96587/passion.of.the.christ\" title=\"\">The Passion of the Christ</a> (2004). That The Passion of the Christ is the only one in the global top 100 (at 68, with earnings of $611m worldwide) would suggest it is the last gasp of an exhausted genre.</p> <p>Ralph Winter, producer of such big ticket hits as X-Men and Star Trek disagrees. \"Studios are looking for timeless product and the Bible provides that. These stories are also public domain, so the studios can get recognition without paying for the rights. Bible&#xa0;stories like the ten commandments have been produced many times over; there is a large audience and the stories are familiar.\"</p> <p>A well-produced and precisely marketed Bible film could seize the 75% of Americans who call themselves Christians who also say they see a film every month. \"There is a potentially huge audience among this faith-based population,\" says Bart Gavigan, writer, director, sought-after script doctor and adviser to Robert Redford's <a href=\"http://www.sundance.org/\" title=\"\">Sundance Institute</a> and British Screen in Europe. \"In terms of tent-pole these Bible stories, though faith-based in origin, are known to the whole world, albeit as myths.\"</p> <p>Biblical settings can afford film-makers a unique, exciting \"anything can happen\" environment, upping the ante on superheroes (who could be a bigger superhero than God?) and allowing something portentous to happen within the entertainment. According to Norman Stone, it's about time. \"We are coming to the end of comic book possibilities.\" As the director of the popular TV documentary, <a href=\"http://www.kjbthefilm.com/\" title=\"\">KJB: The Book that Changed the World</a> and the breakthrough film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/51770/shadowlands\" title=\"\">Shadowlands</a>, which centred on the life of CS Lewis, Stone believes that \"even in their half-remembered context, these stories resonate on a deeper level. You can't say all we are is a bunch of atoms. We don't feel that that sums us up. We wonder about why we're here \u2013 but films haven't addressed that question for a while.\"</p> <p>The currently in-production Mad Max: Fury Road, along with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122297/i.am.legend\" title=\"\">I Am Legend</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114077/children.of.men\" title=\"\">Children of Men</a>, can all be said to have religious purpose buried deep at the heart of them. Films often carry \"religious\" undertones and can be seen as a kind of worship, away from the more traditional religious places.</p> <p>This is why modern moviegoers won't sit through lumbering message movies anymore; the days when Peter O'Toole could appear simultaneously as three angels are past. Even Gibson's The Passion of the Christ was an event movie that courted controversy and got bums on seats, believer and non-believer alike. As Gavigan says: \"A literal approach to history and historical characters will miss the audience.&#xa0;A more dramatic, genre-driven approach is now the norm.\"</p> <p>Is Hollywood, however risk-averse, now wanting to show meaning behind all that smiting? \"As the cost of making studio movies and attracting audiences gets more expensive and more risky, distributors are looking for proven ideas and brand awareness. Bible stories are a good solution,\" says Winter, who also produces films for the Christian market and is currently developing a highly anticipated version of CS Lewis's The Screwtape Letters. \"But I don't think there is some kind of spiritual renewal or movement that is precipitating these kinds of movies.\"</p> <p>If not, perhaps the real zeitgeist behind Hollywood's Bible boom is a simple metaphysical message of hope and faith that neither <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/106557/batman.begins\" title=\"\">Batman</a> nor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/123770/iron.man\" title=\"\">Iron Man</a> can match: in these times of economic and environmental uncertainty, it can't hurt to pray a little in the dark.</p>",

  "<p>The students in the group were smart. They were well dressed and educated, all had laptops, several had expensive smartphones, and yet none of them really expected to pay much, if anything at all, for textbooks or academic materials.</p> <p>I met the students a few weeks ago as part of a focus group looking at digital textbooks. The topic strayed \u2013 as it increasingly does \u2013 into a debate surrounding the cost of materials.</p> <p>\"I've never paid for anything educational online,\" explained one student, \"even though the journals want me to pay.\"</p> <p>\"Abstracts are all you need,\" added another, indicating the trend to skim the publicly available abstracts. \"I often find I'm on a lot of US library websites, where they've already paid for the journal. Then I'll go on their site and read it.\"</p> <p>Increasingly, I see this belief: online materials should be free, particularly when those materials are educational. A recent study by <a href=\"http://www.bowker.co.uk/en-UK/\" title=\"\">Bowker Market Research</a> indicated that 48% of UK students using ebooks were likely to acquire them free, accessing them through their library or via filesharing.</p> <p>Of those students who admitted to illegally downloading books, 22% believe some book content should be free. The message, as the students in the focus group said, is clear: online should be 'off-cost'.</p> <p>As someone working in digital education, I'm concerned that 'e means free' is a long-term threat to innovation. It could even act against the best interests of students. Consider <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access\" title=\"\">open access</a> (OA), which owing to the UK government's recent approval of a report recommending shifting costs to authors and away from readers, is of particular timely relevance.</p> <p>\"The debate is polarised at the moment so that those who advocate open access equate 'free' solely with costless,\" said Dr Martin Coward, senior lecturer in international politics at Newcastle University. Open Access refers to free at the point of use; this doesn't mean there aren't significant costs involved.</p> <p>One cost might be associated with publishers, who add value through peer-review and authenticating research. Publishers also work with authors to make content more readable, filtering out the best work and putting information in context. All of this is meant to make information more accessible \u2013 online or off.</p> <p>This isn't to say that things aren't changing. The world of online is full of opportunities for growth and development. I find this growth fascinating. Digital brings enormous potential to education, improving both the effectiveness and the reach of the learning experience. Look at <a href=\"http://www.macmillannewventures.com/\" title=\"\">Macmillan's New Ventures</a> \u2013 this is a programme that draws together education tech start-ups, providing financial assistance and the backing of a large name. Encouraging development, New Ventures has created things such as <a href=\"http://www.prep-u.com/about/index.php\" title=\"\">PrepU</a>, an adaptive assessment tool that helps students practise digitally for exams.</p> <p>There are many players who must become engaged to develop these benefits \u2013 and some who already are. For instance, some publishers are investing in creating digital learning resources. They are integrating audio, video and interactive elements into course materials (such as homework solutions) that are revolutionising teaching methods. Over time publishers have invested in building an understanding of the structure students need to pass their exams. They work alongside lecturers to deliver resources that align with teaching practices. Perhaps more importantly, publishers have the editorial experience, in-house expertise, technology and tools to make these investments. None of this is free.</p> <p>Innovation will not only be driven by publishers. I see exciting innovations in education popping up all over the place. Creative organisations such as TED have been involved in making lectures available free of charge; there are professors who podcast their lectures widely; there are online-only universities, some of them with impressive global followings; there are other open-source materials from educators and educational bodies. These all help to broaden the reach of education, delivering schooling into the minds of those who want it. These all also require input and investment.</p> <p>Where the investment stops and the free begins, I cannot clearly say. I've been in this industry for many years. I worked at Random House as a digital director. I now work at CourseSmart, a company that rents out eTextbooks. You could say I have an interest in seeing how things are developing. While there are many questions and many nuanced tensions still to sort out, I ultimately believe online isn't without cost, and ultimately, e isn't free. Innovation requires continuing investment, funding and finances that allow teaching resources to keep pace with technological developments.</p> <p><em>Fionnuala Duggan is managing director, international for </em><a href=\"http://www.coursesmart.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>CourseSmart</em></a><em> \u2013 follow the organisation on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/coursesmart\" title=\"\"><em>@coursesmart</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Having spent an intense nine days in the company of 14 European social entrepreneurs, I have seen at first hand the potential of young people to change the world.</p> <p>I was one of the judges for Ben &amp; Jerry's <a href=\"http://www.joinourcore.com/\" title=\"\">Join Our Core</a> competition, which included accompanying all the shortlisted candidates to Uganda to spend a week living with local farmers who supply the ice-cream maker with Fairtrade vanilla.</p> <p>The easiest option in business is to take the path of least resistance, which in our current culture is to maximise profits and remain blinkered to the consequences of our actions.</p> <p>It therefore takes determination and self-awareness to be able to create an enterprise that integrates doing good with doing well, or \u2013 on a deeper level \u2013 merging heart and mind.</p> <p>What we now see is that our past dualistic thinking has not served us well. Charity workers have tended to accuse business executives of being greedy and uncaring, while in turn, companies dismiss NGOs as do-gooders who are not prepared to face up to the real world.</p> <p>However, the sustainability challenges of our age demand we find new solutions, and this can come only from moving beyond judgements and name calling. Social entrepreneurs are showing us that a different future is possible.</p> <p>It would be wrong to try to put all social enterprises in the same box, as the competition judges soon found out, because each one sits in a different position along the spectrum between a charity and a traditional business.</p> <p>Catriona Maclay, who runs London's <a href=\"http://www.hackneypirates.org/\" title=\"\">Hackney Pirates</a>, gives disadvantaged children intensive one-to-one support in a playful environment. While she brings in some income from publications and renting out space, the enterprise relies largely on donations and volunteers.</p> <p>So too does Jakob Lund, the creator of <a href=\"http://play31.org/\" title=\"\">Play31</a>, who won the Danish category for his work in using the unifying power of football for promoting peace in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Towards the other end of the spectrum is the irrepressible 23-year-old Fraser Doherty, creator of the <a href=\"http://shop.superjam.co.uk/\" title=\"\">SuperJam</a> brand in the UK, who outsources production to a major manufacturer and sells his products to large retailers. The social element is that he invests some of the profits in running hundreds of free tea parties for elderly people who live alone or in care homes.</p> <p>Doherty's latest venture, Super Honey, is much closer to most people's idea of a social enterprise, involving prison inmates making hives that are then managed by community beekeeping groups, who in turn involve local schoolchildren. This also gives a much needed boost to the declining bee population.</p> <p>Then there are those who are seeking to have an impact on millions, while others are focusing on transforming the lives of only a few.</p> <p>Through his organisation, <a href=\"http://www.mattecentrum.se/\" title=\"\">Mattecentrum</a>, Swedish winner Johan Wendt tutors free of charge around 70,000 young people in maths every month, and is now planning to expand to the UK.</p> <p>Veronica D'Souza moved to Kenya to promote <a href=\"http://www.ruby-cup.com/\" title=\"\">Ruby Cup</a>, a silicone menstrual cup that replaces the need for sanitary pads, which most girls in Africa cannot afford and as a result often drop out of school.</p> <p>Not only is she seeking to stop millions of women from using alternatives such as newspaper, cloth or mud, D'Souza also wants to raise awareness about menstrual hygiene and generate income for local entrepreneurs who sell the product.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale is Dutch award winner Peter den Hond, who has created <a href=\"http://www.fairmail.info/\" title=\"\">FairMail</a>, which allows marginalised teenagers in Peru and India to create greetings cards using their own photographs, with half the profit going to pay for their education plus support for their families. While he could spread the profits more thinly, he wants to radically change the lives of a few, and over the past four years, 33 teenagers and their families have benefited from \u20ac225,000.</p> <p>All the candidates express the desire to be of service and to make a real difference in the lives of others, but each one has their own story to tell. Some like Doherty and Jenny Dawson, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/tackling-food-waste-social-enterprise-model?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">founder of chutney and jam company Rubies in the Rubble</a>, have taken childhood passions and transformed them into profitable ventures.</p> <p>Others have taken traditional business models and given them an innovative twist. Wouter Durville from the Netherlands sells products and services such as water bottles and green energy on a buy one, give one basis. For example, if you buy health insurance, you also automatically insure an orphan in Tanzania.</p> <p>Like other businesses, these social enterprises have challenges they need to overcome. Ruby Cup still has to prove it is hygienic when used in areas where there is a lack of clean water, while ONEforONE needs to convince NGOs of the moral case for giving insurance to orphans, when it is the job of the state to provide healthcare.</p> <p>Many of them also need support in scaling up, which is why part of the prize is six months' free consulting from the social enterprise network Ashoka.</p> <p>Of course, while it's great to see European-based social enterprises flourishing, where innovation is desperately needed is in the developing world. Spending time in Uganda, the finalists saw first-hand the fine line between life and death and the disastrous consequences of economic, social and environmental failure.</p> <p>Africa is a classic case where traditional charity has largely failed to lift people out of grinding poverty and in many cases has led to a culture of dependency. On the other side of the equation, business is often rightly accused of exploiting the poor by buying agricultural products and raw materials on the cheap and then making huge profits from processing and branding them.</p> <p>Thankfully, the idea behind social enterprise is starting to gain a foothold, with NGOs and progressive businesses recognising they need to work together to create sustainable livelihoods.</p> <p>What all the finalists of the competition demonstrate is the importance of courage and leadership in addressing the inequalities and social injustice in our world. We have learned from experience that the answers are not going to come by waiting idly and hoping governments or institutions are going to come up with the answers.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>For a sport that has the air of a perpetual teenager, it could be forgiven for quietly ignoring this rather middle-aged birthday. But British surfing will celebrate its 50th anniversary on Saturday overlooking the Cornish swell.</p> <p>From salty old veterans to sharply styled youngsters, the British surfing community will gather as the sun goes down on a headland by Fistral Beach in Newquay, Cornwall, where, it is now claimed, the modern board-riding boom was launched by four young Australian life-savers who sailed from Sydney in 1962 with the first fibreglass surfboards seen in Britain.</p> <p>The coming-of-age event is part of a growing fascination in the roots of British surf culture, which this year has seen the launch of a <a href=\"http://www.museumofbritishsurfing.org.uk/\" title=\"\">national surfing museum</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/04/prince-waves-uk-surfing-museum\" title=\"\">revelation that Edward VIII may have been the first British surfer, albeit in Hawaii,</a>, a 240-page <a href=\"http://www.surfingtribe.co.uk/\" title=\"\">history of British surfing</a> and the launch of a lottery-funded <a href=\"http://www.thefirstwave.co.uk/\" title=\"\">oral history project</a> to capture the memories of UK surf pioneers.</p> <p>Like any good golden jubilee party, the bash will be steeped in nostalgia, and the Newquay town authorities are screening <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Endless_Summer\" title=\"\">The Endless Summer</a>, the classic 1966 surf documentary that charts the journey of two Californian surfers to Senegal, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and across the Pacific Ocean to Tahiti and Hawaii.</p> <p>The movie's stars never made it to chilly Cornwall, but Bob Head, John Campbell, Ian Tiley and Warren Mitchell did. The consensus is growing that the arrival of these Aussie teenagers sparked the pastime's development into an industry and professional sport in the UK now valued at over \u00a3120m a year.</p> <p>The four young Australians sailed on the SS Arcadia from Sydney to Tilbury docks in 1962 and crammed what are thought to be the first fibreglass surfboards ever seen in Britain into London taxis and onwards to Cornwall. They came in search of life-guarding work but, in their time off, amazed the Cornish locals with their ability to swoop 30 yards along an unbroken wave using their Malibu boards, a feat impossible on the British wooden planks.</p> <p>\"The impact was pretty tremendous and we ended up having quite a following,\" recalled Mitchell this week. \"My beach was Watergate Bay, which was leased by the council to Ralph Doney, and after our shift, around six or seven o'clock, he would ask us to perform on our surfboards. He would sell Cornish pasties to the people who came to watch, and our payment would be a couple of pasties.\"</p> <p>Mitchell was just 19 when he arrived in Newquay, but the four professional lifeguards were credited with dramatically reducing the number of fatalities, which totalled 19 the year before. They were also an exotic addition to the otherwise staid family holiday scene in Cornwall. Newly surfaced photographs show curious locals gathering on the cliffs to marvel at the Australians, their colourful shorts and 10ft boards.</p> <p>\"We worked hard, but the party side of things was great,\" said Mitchell, now 70 and retired in Derby. \"Someone would come along with a keg of beer, we'd roll it down the beach and set fire to all the driftwood. That sort of thing was unheard of, but it became synonymous with us. If you wanted to do something different, you'd go down and have a beach barbecue with the Australian surfers.\"</p> <p>They set the template for a surf culture in the south-west of England that has become a mainstay of local economies such as north Devon. There, the small group of breaks around Croyde and Woolacombe alone attract more than 40,000 visitors a year. They inject more than \u00a350m into the area annually, according to <a href=\"http://surfinggb.com/wp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Final-Trisurf-Report-June-08.pdf\" title=\"\">a report</a> funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Industry sources estimate that half a million holidaymakers try the sport for the first time every year, while the same number are regular surfers. There are around 30 surf shops in Newquay alone.</p> <p>\"Newquay has a lot to thank surfing for,\" said Eve Wooldridge, manager of the Newquay Business Improvement District. \"Surfing is worth more than \u00a370m to the Cornish economy alone, and is an integral economic force in Newquay, where hundreds of businesses rely on the sport. For this reason, I think it's fitting that we're honouring 50 years of surfing here in Newquay, where it all began.\"</p> <p>But, during that first summer, the Australians had Cornwall's Atlantic swells to themselves. A few months into the season, Campbell wrote a letter home to Surfing World magazine in Australia where the waves were rather more busy.</p> <p>\"Conditions haven't been too crowded here with about six of us spread over 11 beaches,\" he wrote drily.</p> <p>Their presence had a powerful impact on young locals in the coming years.</p> <p>\"In 1963, I was there, an 11-year-old kid starting stand-up surfing with a handful of men in Newquay bay,\" said Roger Mansfield, author of The Surfing Tribe, a history of British surfing. \"It was an amazing thrill in the moment and, as it turned out, a life-forming experience for me. The elder surf-riding peer group, who befriended me, had not been riding the Malibus for more than a year. My research, more than t40 years later, has confirmed that 1962 was the critical formative year, both for Newquay and several other significant North Cornwall communities.\"</p> <p>The local council thought the Malibu boards were now an essential piece of life-saving kit and commissioned half a dozen from local lifeguard Bill Bailey. Bob Head began to make them, too, and it was the beginning of 50 years of steady growth that has transformed Newquay and other towns in Devon and Cornwall into surf cities.</p> <p>\"The Aussie guys sparked something in 1962,\" said Chris Power, the former editor of CARVE surfing magazine. \"They had been riding these Malibu boards since an American demonstration team from Hawaii and California came to Sydney for the 1956 Olympics. One of the beaches they went to was Avalon where the four guys were based. When they came to Cornwall, there were thousands of people splashing around on wooden bellyboards. When they saw the Australians riding along the waves for 30 or 40 yards, they thought, Wow, we want to do that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Danny Guthrie hopes he can enhance his chances of an England call-up at a ground where, as a former Newcastle United player, he is guaranteed a hot reception. \"Sunderland's a harsh environment,\" said Reading's new playmaker, who found himself eclipsed by Yohan Cabaye at Newcastle last season but reportedly caught Roy Hodgson's eye at Chelsea on Wednesday. \"I'm looking forward to it.\" Meanwhile Adam Federici, Brian McDermott's Australian goalkeeper, aims to avoid reprising the slips that cost Reading dear in their opening two games.

  "<p>There's a fictional quality to the closeted environment of the Edinburgh International Book festival. For two weeks, Charlotte Square is fortified with a circle of portable buildings and Spiegeltents, creating a safe space for a fantasy of literary culture to flourish without undue interference from the outside world. It's a fantasy taking place in the daydreams of a seventysomething retired English lecturer, and The Book is its key signifier. The Book as object, as specks of ink splattered on decaying vegetable matter, tenaciously clinging to the bookshop shelf as the internet gushes forth its infinite flood of blogposts, status updates and indie-published ebooks.</p> <p>The science-fiction track within the EIBF programme came marked with the now standard disclaimers \u2026 it's not all rubbish, some of it actually has quite a lot of insight into that \"technology\" stuff of which we're all so terrified. It was rather like listening to a steam-train driver grudgingly admit that those jet-fighter pilots might be on to something. Neal Stephenson, one of the big names of SF attending this year's festival, has <a href=\"http://interviews.slashdot.org/story/04/10/20/1518217/neal-stephenson-responds-with-wit-and-humor\" title=\"\">written with some insight about the awkward experience of being patronised at literary events</a>, even when your books engage more readers in serious debate than most of the other attendees put together.</p> <p>But it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/china-mieville\" title=\"\">China Mi\u00e9ville</a> who took centre stage at this year's EIBF, first at a sold-out discussion of his young-adult novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fantasy/9780230765122/railsea\" title=\"\">Railsea</a> with fellow writer Patrick Ness, then at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/21/china-mieville-the-future-of-the-novel?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">a barnstorming polemic on the future of the novel</a>. Mi\u00e9ville arrived at the festival at the climax of an amazing five-year period, during which he has gone from a cult writer of baroque urban fantasy to arguably one of the most influential writers in any genre in the UK. His dual identity as radical Marxist academic and fantasy novelist, his absolute love of geek culture combined with a true respect for literary traditions, his unchallenged status as the writer with <a href=\"http://couldtheybeatupchinamieville.wordpress.com/who-is-china/\" title=\"\">\"the best guns in literatur\"</a> and, of course, a run of superbly idiosyncratic SF masterpieces \u2013 including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780330493109/the-city-and-the-city\" title=\"\">The City and the City</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780230750760/embassytown\" title=\"\">Embassytown</a> \u2013 have propelled him to unusual levels of fame.</p> <p>Queried by Ness on the importance of genre in his writing, Mi\u00e9ville replied that he prefers to think of genre as a literary tradition. It's a minority viewpoint even within SF, where commercial pressures often push writers toward strict generic criteria, a pressure Mi\u00e9ville has clearly succeeded in resisting. But it's the only perspective that really makes sense of SF's growing cultural significance. Through the 20th century, it evolved as a literary tradition in continuous dialogue with the most significant forces shaping that century: science and technology. Now, in the early 21st century, SF provides writers with a rich set of ideas and metaphors to explore the incredible complexity of the modern era. Mi\u00e9ville's fiction is in continual dialogue with the SF tradition, recycling and reshaping it as a vehicle for his own philosophy and beliefs.</p> <p>The impact of technology was the subject of Mi\u00e9ville's address on the future of the novel. It's a discussion that, within the publishing industry at least, tends to be distorted by that deeply conservative question: \"How do we all keep making a living from this thing?\" Mi\u00e9ville presented the counter-argument: how does anyone make a living from anything in our neo-liberal economy? The very same neo-liberal economic model that advocates of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6337781.stm\" title=\"\">DRM</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/26/ofcom-outlines-anti-piracy-rules\" title=\"\">anti-piracy legislation</a> are so keen to protect. As Mi\u00e9ville so aptly concludes, if we're going to arrive at a new economic model that rewards human creativity and ingenuity, we're going to have to think deeply and radically about how we reshape our entire society. If any literary tradition is adapted to lead that discussion, it is science fiction.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>In most social media channels you have followers or people who 'like' your page and this often means you are preaching to the converted. How do you attract the attention of, and engage with, those who don't already 'like' what you say? </strong><br><em>From </em><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tas-bhanji/8/718/1b2\" title=\"\"><em>Tahsin Bhanji</em></a><em> via LinkedIn</em></h2> <p>I wouldn't get too comfortable about current followers. People are willing to 'like' you for only as long as you continue to be relevant, consistent and engaging. Whether your organisation is large or small, the ability to retain a mass of fans and create brand affinity is critical.</p> <p>In terms of reaching new audiences, it's about:</p> <p>\u2022 Having clear goals and a concise communication strategy. Planning ahead and preparing posts and associated media is really important \u2013 and images and videos are especially great for sharing.</p> <p>\u2022 An integrated approach with other communication channels; driving traffic to and from social media.</p> <p>\u2022 Finding innovative ways to add value for your fans.</p> <p><a href=\"http://uk.burberry.com/store/\" title=\"\">Burberry</a>, the designer brand that celebrated 10m Facebook fans in January 2012 is a social media success story. On its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/burberry\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a>, the company streams live fashion shows, post videos of sponsored music bands and offers exclusive product development samples, such as new perfumes. Its heavy investment in social media has paid off, and as a result Burberry achieved a <a href=\"http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/the-frontline-blog/2139460/social-media-pays-burberry-profits-rise-21-cent\" title=\"\">21% rise in fourth-quarter sales</a>.</p> <p>As for those who do not agree or like what you say, the dynamic between the oil and gas industry and NGOs is a good example. Give your adversaries a platform for their views, stay impartial, be gracious and have a plan for mitigating risks should a crisis happen.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/17/o2-outage-social-media-masterclass\" title=\"\">case study from O2</a> is also a brilliant example in turning a negative Twitter storm into a positive PR lesson by facing the issue head on, with bravery, humanity and, above all, humour.</p> <h2><strong>Should sustainability have its own feeds or should it be integrated into those of the wider business? </strong><em>From </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/givenlondon\" title=\"\"><em>@givenlondon</em></a><em> via Twitter</em></h2> <p>It depends on who are you talking to (the target audience) and your goals.</p> <p>If the goal is awareness or brand positioning and the aim is to tell people, \"this is our brand and this is what we do in sustainability\", I'd suggest you integrate the social media channels and strategy into the wider communication strategy. Here you can use your specific brand voice and keep the message topics broad but compelling.</p> <p>Position your brand as a hero or problem solver and offer value to your fans. Its crucial to align messages on brand values, so assembling an editorial board with representatives for communication, marketing, press and digital is an effective way of sourcing content and timing campaigns for maximum impact.</p> <p>Perhaps your goal is to inspire, build trust or raise your company's profile as an expert. Or maybe you want to attract a small group of expert followers in the industry. In this case, a separate feed with detailed data, statistics, KPIs, white papers and reports would be a better way to engage your audience. You could use the loyal following this feed attracts as a thinktank for generating input into future strategies, or just for keeping up with trends across this smaller but influential community.</p> <p>It is important to think about what success means to your business and find ways to measure it. I am a key advocate of making decisions based on facts rather than assumptions. Use statistics to drive change. There is nothing wrong with altering the course if something doesn't work and fails to yield the results you want. Taking small steps is both inexpensive and a great way to learn what works and what doesn't for your business.</p> <h2><strong>How can we increase our followers on Twitter and Facebook, promoting sustainability services? </strong><em>From </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/GPSLtd2\" title=\"\"><em>@GPSltd2</em></a><em> via Twitter</em></h2> <p>Simply put, figure out how to add value for your fans and followers. Give them something they want or need. The top reasons why people share content using social media platforms are to make life easier, build relationships, help others and craft their identity.</p> <p>Start by looking at who you want to attract by examining factors such as gender and demographics. Once you have focused on a target audience, research their interests, preferred channels and social media behaviour and then assess how you can give them value, engage them in conversation, ask for feedback and reward them. Sustainability comes with a sceptical tag so use real life stories rather than glossy reports to convey your message. Companies are moving towards specific campaigns rather than talking about their brand in general terms.</p> <p>Be seasonal and timely and make an impact by posting:</p> <p>\u2022 Great photos: they are easier to share for viral effect and quicker to download on mobile devices. Try to source well shot, interesting composition images that create a strong visceral response that is both engaging on a human level and captures your brand.</p> <p>\u2022 Videos: keep them short, 90 seconds at the most.</p> <p>\u2022 Concise but well written copy, keeping posts between 100-250 characters.</p> <p>\u2022 Call to action: get the audience involved by asking them to share content and offer exclusive deals or direct them to your website for valuable content that can be accessed only via social media platforms.</p> <p>Another way of increasing your following is through exposure; link any other communication channels such as e-mail newsletters, website or online apps to your social media platforms. If you have an existing customer database, you can carefully target these people with specific and relevant social media content.</p> <h2><strong>What tips are there for making environmental sustainability measures newsworthy and engaging using social media?

  "<h2><strong>Thanks for the memories<br></strong></h2> <p>It's my last day on the fringe and I'll be tying up a few loose ends, seeing a final couple of shows and revisiting a favourite: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/14/knee-deep-edinburgh-festival-assembly-george-square\">Knee Deep at Assembly</a>. I must have seen hundreds of shows at Edinburgh over the years, and I wonder how many of this year's shows will really imprint themselves on my mind? I certainly won't be forgetting <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review\">Mies Julie</a> in a hurry, and I suspect people will be talking about <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk\">Bullet Catch</a> at the Traverse for a long time to come. And <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">Songs of Lear</a> seems to have already passed into legend even though it's only a work in progress. </p> <p>At the beginning of the festival, I asked about the shows people remembered from their previous fringe visits. Some of you clearly take this kind of task very seriously. Thank you to the man who stopped me on South Bridge to tell me about the thrill of seeing Black Watch in the Drill Hall off Forest Row. Check out Edinburgh Festival Punter's list <a href=\"http://www.edinburghfestivalpunter.co.uk/FavouriteShows.pdf\">here</a>. </p> <p>On the blog, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17559301\">Edinclare remarked how lucky she was to actually live in the city</a> and offered an extensive list: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Early Theatre de Complicite shows down at the much lamented Theatre Workshop. Black Watch at the Drill Hall. Medea with the chariot flying off into the Edinburgh sky at the end. The Tempest on oil drums at the Quad, Coriolanus with soldiers strutting between the colonnades there (liking that venue!). Down at St Stephen's when it was Aurora Nova, so many wonderful shows \u2013 Song of the Goat, Do Theatre, the Marionette's Battle of Stalingrad (tiny scale for something so huge and it worked). Looking forward to seeing the space used again \u2013 well done, Northern Stage. The Traverse \u2013 Gargarin Way, Prudencia Hart, Ontroerend Goed's in your face 'Once and for all, we're gonna to tell you who we we are so shut up and listen! (also award for longest title).' So many shows there over the years, both at the new and old building down in West Bow \u2013 images remain though some of the titles have gone. And Polish shows from Richard Demarco. The old Cafe Graffiti. Fantastic memories.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17562575\">Senton offered</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first production of John Clifford's In\u00e9s de Castro at the old Traverse; The Three Bonazzi, a clown show directed by Jos Houben; my first exposure to Derevo with Harlekin at Pleasance, and again with Ketzal at St Stephen's (still digesting Mephisto Waltz); an extraordinary sketch show called Universal Grinding Wheel; Licedei's The Family.</p> </blockquote> <p>Next year, I will have been coming to the fringe for 30 years, so over the next 12 months I'll be trawling my own memories to come up with the list of memorable shows. If you can help me give my memories a nudge by sharing yours, I'd be very grateful. </p> <h2><strong>What to see: my UK-wide theatre tips<br></strong></h2> <p>With Edinburgh in its last gasp, and the rest of the country's theatre still not fully awake, it's another abbreviated list this week. Full service will resume next Friday, when things start warming up again. In Edinburgh, these are the shows you shouldn't miss this weekend: Mies Julie at Assembly Mound and Knee Deep at <a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com\">Assembly</a> George Square, The List and Big Mouth at <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">Summerhall</a>, Oh the Humanity and The Price of Everything at <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk\">Northern Stage at St Stephen's</a>, Bullet Catch, Beats, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/16/monkey-bars-edinburgh-festival-review\">Monkey Bars</a> and the Curious Scrapbook of Josephine Bean at the <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk\">Traverse</a>, Dr Brown Befrdfgth (in the comedy section, but full of theatre techniques) at <a href=\"http://www.underbelly.co.uk\">Underbelly</a>. </p> <p>Lots of Edinburgh fringe shows are heading out on tour this week: <a href=\"http://www.stellarquines.com\">Stellar Quines</a>' The List heads to the Byre theatre in St Andrews, The Prize heads to <a href=\"http://www.live.org.uk\">Live Theatre</a> in Newcastle, Phil Porter's delightful Blink goes into <a href=\"http://www.sohotheatre.com\">Soho</a>, Anthony Rapp's Without You opens at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London on Wednesday, Joel Horwood's deeply touching <a href=\"http://www.easternangles.co.uk \">I Heart Peterborough</a> is at the Nightingale in Brighton from Friday, and Curious Directive's After the Rainfall is at <a href=\"http://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk\">Watford Palace</a> from Thursday. </p> <p>Of course, it's not all over on Monday for the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\">International Festival</a>, which still has Ariane Mnouchkine's Les Naufrag\u00e9s du Fol Espoir running until Tuesday, and Vanishing Point's modern version of Alice, Wonderland, opening at the Royal Lyceum on Wednesday.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Scotland, the new season begins at <a href=\"http://www.dundeerep.co.uk\">Dundee Rep</a> on Thursday with Chris Rattray's The Mill Lavvies, set in a jute mill in the early 1960s. In Northern Ireland, director Robert Wilson is on stage in his own production of Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape as part of the <a href=\"http://www.ardhowentheatre.com\">Enniskillen International Beckett Festival</a> this weekend, and his ambulatory performance <a href=\"http://www.nnfestival.org.uk\">Walking</a> continues at Holkham on the Norfolk coastline until 2 September. </p> <p>The brilliant <a href=\"http://www.lakesalive.org\">Lakes Alive</a> continue to bring outdoor theatre and street arts to the Lake District: rock up to Whitehaven for the aerial show, Voala, on Monday and head to Kendal for Mintfest, which starts next Friday. </p> <p>It's your last chance for the <a href=\"http://www.yorkmysteryplays2012.com\">York Mystery Plays</a> this weekend. There is a revival of The Importance of Being Earnest opening at <a href=\"http://www.nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/\">Nottingham Playhouse</a>, but of rather more interest is Calixto Bieito's Forests at <a href=\"http://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk\">Birmingham Old Rep</a> which is a journey through landscape using Shakespeare's texts. There are good things at <a href=\"http://www.oxfordplayhouse.com\">Oxford Playhouse, </a>where Druid's Tom Murphy season is followed by Hysteria with Antony Sher. Haunting Julia goes out on tour from the <a href=\"http://www.mercurytheatre.co.uk\">Mercury</a> in Colchester. I'm off to the <a href=\"http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk \">Theatre Royal</a> in Bath on Wednesday to see Adrian Noble's The Tempest.</p> <p>In London, BAC's <a href=\"http://www.bac.org.uk\">Cook Up</a> season begins with work by John Moran, Ross Sutherland and Amy Draper. <a href=\"http://www.kaiteoreilly.com/\">Kaite O Reilly's In Water I'm Weightless</a>, Claire Cunningham, and Bobby Baker's Mad Gyms are among the <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/festival\">Unlimited productions and commissions</a> that can be seen at London's South Bank at the end of the week. Enjoy the weekend, and do tell us all about the shows you have seen or are seeing.</p>",
  "<p>This is the first book I have read by Lucy and Stephen Hawking and I like it very much! I have heard of Stephen Hawking's work on black holes and string theory but I had not read the books he has written with his daughter Lucy. I am guessing Lucy wrote it mostly because her Dad is probably thinking about much more complex problems. If that is true she can write very well.</p> <p>The story starts with George, a ten year old who does not know much about the universe around us. His education starts with a fancy-dress party that he is invited to. The theme is the universe and everyone has to come dressed as one of the objects that exist in the universe. For example, you could be 'dark matter', a solar system made out of hula hoops or simply the 'redshift' (in which case you keep shifting away from people coming through the door).</p> <p>The party was hosted by Eric, father to George's friend Annie. Soon after George's introduction to the cosmos, he got an e-mail from Annie inviting him to come quickly to Florida. All she said was it was a cosmic mission and he must not say anything to his parents \u2013 just tell them it is a normal holiday. And with a little help from his Granny, George was on his way!</p> <p>Landing in America, George found out that Eric had launched an expensive robot onto Mars from the Global Space Agency but after landing on Mars, the robot started acting up. Instead of analyzing samples from Mars, it started waving its robotic arms around and sending useless pictures. With Eric struggling to make sense of things, Annie, George and 9 year old science-whiz Emmit leap into action. Using Cosmos, a supercomputer that opened portals into space, they manage to sneak out to Mars and then go on an exciting treasure hunt around the universe.</p> <p>I give this book 9/10 because it explains science through a gripping story that involves nerds, scientists, villains and kids all caught up in a whirlwind adventure. If you have the least bit interest in science you are sure to love this book!</p> <p><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you've read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II [Sat.] - Update II [Sun.])</strong></p> <p>The New Statesman owes its readers a correction for a clear and crucial falsehood contained in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/08/five-legal-myths-about-assange-extradition\">this much-cited argument</a> by its legal correspondent, David Allen Green. As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/julian-assange-media-contempt\">noted on Wednesday</a>, Green purported to debunk what he called \"common misconceptions\" and \"myths\" being spread by supporters of Ecuador's asylum decision in the Assange case, but in doing so, he propagated his own myth on <em>the key question</em> in this matter. By doing so, he misled large numbers of readers not only at the New Statesman but in many other venues which cited his claims. Regardless of one's views on the asylum matter, nobody should want clear errors on the central issues to be left standing in major media outlets.</p> <p>The falsehood here is clear and straightforward. One of the \"myths\" Green purported to debunk was that \"Sweden should guarantee that there be no extradition to USA.\" Assange's lawyers, along with Ecuadorean officials, have repeatedly told Sweden and Britain that Assange would immediately travel to Stockholm to face these allegations if some type of satisfactory assurance against extradition to the US could be given. This is the paramount issue because it shows that it is not Assange and Ecuadorean officials \u2013 but rather the Swedish and British governments \u2013 who are preventing the sex assault allegations from being fairly and legally resolved as they should be. </p> <p>But Green claimed that \"[i]t would not be legally possible for Swedish government to give any guarantee about a future extradition, and nor would it have any binding effect on the Swedish legal system in the event of a future extradition request.\" He said that this is so in part because \"any final word on an extradition would (quite properly) be with an independent Swedish court, and not the government giving the purported 'guarantee'.\" He then cited a British lawyer (notably, not a Swedish one) who <a href=\"http://www.firmmagazine.com/features/1179/Assange_-_what%27s_going_on%3F.html\">made the same claim</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]t appears that if the extradition is contested as it would be in Assange's case then it is a matter for the court not the government to decide if he is extradited.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is completely and unquestionably false. It is simply untrue that it is Swedish courts, rather than the Swedish government, who are the final decision-makers in extradition requests. It is equally untrue that the Swedish government has no final decision-making power regarding extradition requests that are legally sanctioned by the Swedish judiciary. These are not matters for reasonable debate. The law is clear. Green's claim is false.</p> <p>Last night, international law professor <a href=\"http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/melbourne-law-school/community/our-staff/staff-profile/username/Kevin%20Jon%20Heller\">Kevin Jon Heller at Melbourne Law School</a> emailed me and wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]t is incorrect to say that the final decision to extradite Assange from Sweden to the US would be made by the courts.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He directed me to <a href=\"http://klamberg.blogspot.se/2012/08/extradition-of-assange-to-us-via-sweden.html\">this analysis</a> from Mark Klamberg \u2013 a professor of international law at the University of Stockholm \u2013 who dissects Sweden's extradition law and makes Green's error as clear as it can be [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"How does procedure work if somebody is to extradited from Sweden? \u2026 [I]f the person referred to in the request has not consented to being extradited, the case shall be tried by the supreme court. Section 20(1) provides that if the supreme court has considered that there is a legal obstacle to extradition the request may not be granted.</p> <p><em>\"Even if the supreme court has found that there are no obstacles, the government can refuse extradition.</em> This is because section 1(1) provides that if certain conditions are fulfilled, a person 'may' not 'shall' be extradited. In other words, even if the prosecutor-general and the supreme court finds that all conditions for extradition are fulfilled<em> the government may veto such extradition.</em> It does not work in the reverse way, the government can not grant extradition if the supreme court has found that any of the required conditions are lacking.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Let's repeat that: \"Even if the supreme court has found that there are no obstacles, the government can refuse extradition.\" And: \"Even if the prosecutor-general and the supreme court finds that all conditions for extradition are fulfilled the government may veto such extradition.\" In other words, under clear Swedish law, the Swedish government has exactly the final decision-making authority over extradition that Green told his readers it lacks. </p> <p>Professor Klamberg is far from alone in making this clear. As I noted on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">this Swedish-Moroccon lawyer analyzed</a> Swedish extradition law in rigorous detail to make the same point:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Swedish extradition law clearly states that the Swedish government is the body deciding on any extradition request.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Moreover:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No provision gives any court the right to decide on an extraditions request.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The court's role in extradition requests is limited to this situation:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The government may not extradite someone for whom the supreme court has found that an extradition would not be in conformity with the law.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As I noted on Wednesday, his analysis of the law (exactly like Professor Klamberg's) shows there are two possible outcomes once the contested extradition request goes to the Swedish court: first, the court rules the extradition request is not cognizable under relevant law, in which case the Swedish government is barred from extraditing; or second, the court rules the extradition request is cognizable under relevant law, <em>in which case the Swedish government has the option not to extradite</em>. As he put it:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The deciding body is thus the government, with an input by the prosecutor general.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Swedish extradition law is written to ensure that if an extradition is to occur, Swedish government officials, not its courts, are the final decision-makers on whether that should take place.</p> <p>More clear evidence of Green's error, first noted by <a href=\"http://pastehtml.com/view/c91yw7wjy.html\">this superb debunking of Green</a>, comes from <a href=\"http://www.dfat.gov.au/foi/downloads/dfat-foi-1112-F264.pdf\">documents sent by the Australian diplomatic mission in Sweden</a> to its home government on the Assange/extradition matter (they were declassified and released to the public by the Australian government). In response to questions from Canberra about what an extradition request to Sweden would entail, the Australian diplomatic mission explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The process require[s] a request from another state, a decision by Sweden's supreme court on whether extradition was possible, and <em>finally a decision by government to go forward with the extradition.</em>\" [my emphasis; p61]</p> </blockquote> <p>The internal communications in the Australian government go on to note:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Swedish government could deny an extradition or temporary surrender that the supreme court had approved, but if the supreme court denied an extradition or temporary surrender application, then the matter ended there; ie, the government could not approve a process that the supreme court had rejected.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Again: the Swedish courts simply decide whether extradition is legally possible, but the final decision as to whether to extradite is vested in the Swedish government.</p> <p>This is not some sort of strange or exotic feature of Swedish law. As Professor Heller wrote when explaining that the Swedish government possesses exactly the final decision-making authority Green denied it has:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Nor is that unusual; I don't know of any states that give the final decision to courts instead of to the executive.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In light of this abundant evidence, I trust that even the most hardened Assange critic will acknowledge that Green was radically wrong on this key point. It should be noted that those sources I just cited are not Assange supporters, but rather are the opposite: they are all, to varying degrees, hostile to his fight against extradition to Sweden. Professor Klamberg (<a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/22/klamberg-on-extraditing-assange-from-sweden-to-the-u-s/\">along with Professor Heller</a>) is highly skeptical that Sweden would extradite Assange to the US. The Swedish-Moroccon lawyer I cited began his analysis by declaring:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"First, let me state that I am as adamantly in favour of Julian Assange being extradited to Sweden as I am opposed to him being extradited to the USA for any WikiLeaks-related offense.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And the Australian government has been infamously unsupportive of the rights of its citizen. But they nonetheless all make crystal clear that Green's statement about the Swedish government lacking the power to decide extradition is factually false. </p> <p>It is inconceivable that the New Statesman would allow such a flagrant error on this key issue to remain unretracted, particularly since it was offered under the guise of Green's legal expertise. Indeed, when replying to Green on Wednesday, I myself assumed that there must be some reasonable basis to his claim about the lack of authority on the part of the Swedish government over extradition requests, and thus too readily vested his claim with credibility: a mistake I immediately corrected with updates upon learning that his claim was false. The New Statesman has the absolute journalistic obligation to prominently correct this error.</p> <p>It may be true that there are <em>other independent reasons</em> to argue that Sweden should not offer Assange the assurance against extradition that he seeks. One may contend, for instance, that Sweden should, or even must, wait until it receives an extradition request and its courts rule on its legality before it can make a determination as to whether it will comply. That is an argument Green makes. Professor Klamberg notes there \"is nothing in the extradition of criminal offences act that deals with this scenario, but it would depart from established practice.\"</p> <p>I happen not to find that objection valid. At the very least, one can imagine all sorts of ways that Sweden, Ecuador and Assange's lawyers could negotiate a resolution that provides Assange with meaningful protections against his fear of extradition to the US while following standard procedure on extraditions. Swedish authorities could, for instance, publicly state that they view espionage charges for the \"crime\" of reporting on government secrets to be a \"political crime\" not subject to extradition, but still reserve the right to formally decide upon any extradition request if and when they receive one. In the last four paragraphs of his analysis, <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">this lawyer</a> <strong><em>[link fixed]</em></strong> lays out exactly how such a deal could be reached consistent with Swedish law. If there were any real desire to find a resolution, one could be found. It is Sweden's steadfast refusal even to negotiate these matters that led the Ecuadoreans to be suspicious of their motives and to conclude that asylum was necessary here to protect Assange from political prosecution.</p> <p>But all of that is a completely separate issue from the glaring error in Green's post about whether it is the Swedish government or its courts that have final decision-making authority. The fact that Green made other arguments in support of his ultimate conclusion does not remotely mitigate his false claim that \"any final word on an extradition would (quite properly) be with an independent Swedish court, and not the government giving the purported 'guarantee'.\" Nor does it relieve the New Statesman of the obligation to prominently correct this error.</p> <p>I'm certainly not accusing Green of bad faith \u2013 ie, of knowingly making false claims. It is difficult to discern Swedish extradition law without being a Swedish legal expert or relying on them, which is why it's a good idea for people like Green not to do it, especially in a periodical. But motives aside, what he told his readers under the guise of legal expertise is unquestionably false, and it had serious consequences for how this whole debate has been perceived.</p> <p>This is why this is so crucial: if Sweden (and/or Britain) would provide some meaningful assurance that Assange would not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges for WikiLeaks' journalism, then the vast majority of asylum supporters (including me) would loudly demand that he immediately travel to Stockholm to confront those allegations; Assange himself has said he would do so. That gives the lie to the ugly slander that those who have expressed support for Ecuador's asylum decision are dismissive of the sex assault claims or do not care about seeing them resolved.</p> <p>Speaking for myself, I have always said the same thing about those allegations in Sweden from the moment they emerged: they are serious and deserve legal resolution. It is not Assange or his supporters preventing that resolution, but the Swedish and British governments, which are strangely refusing even to negotiate as to how Assange's rights against <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/us-intends-to-chase-assange-cables-show-20120817-24e1l.html\">unjust extradition and political persecution</a> can be safeguarded along with the rights of the complainants to have their allegations addressed. Green's false claim that the Swedish government is unable to act because it has no final authority over extradition has seriously distorted this issue, and it is why it should be promptly and prominently corrected by the New Statesman.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: On Twitter today, one of the four legal sources cited here, Mark Klamberg, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Klamberg/status/239028648424898560\">claimed</a> that I \"distorted\" his argument by omitting certain claims he made.

  "<p>The Republicans roll into Tampa next week \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/tropical-storm-isaac-republicans-tampa?CMP=twt_gu\">hurricanes permitting</a> \u2013 for their <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\">national convention</a> where Mitt Romney will be officially confirmed as the party's candidate for president.</p> <p>The build-up to the convention has been overshadowed by the highly controversial \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/todd-akin-10-points-behind?newsfeed=true\">legitimate rape</a>\" remarks made by Todd Atkin, a congressman from Missouri, and his subsequent refusal to quit his bid for re-election despite pressure from the party's leadership.</p> <p>But while the US media has largely focused on this unedifying internal battle, Mitt Romney has laid out his all-important <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/23/us-usa-campaign-romney-idUSBRE87J0P020120823\">energy plans</a> for the country. The headline is that, if elected as president, he will make the US \"energy independent\" by 2020 and, by doing so, create three million jobs.</p> <p>To eliminate the nation's reliance on imported oil and gas, Romney says he will lift many offshore drilling restrictions and free up states to use federal lands for energy production. By contrast, there was little focus in his plan on renewables, such as wind and solar. In essence, he has merged George W Bush's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/01/usa.julianborger\">we're addicted to oil</a>\" remarks with Sarah Palin's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jul/14/sarah-palin-energy-obama\">drill, baby, drill</a>\". (It's possibly not a coincidence that his plan was announced just hours after he had raised <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gBxsTI0Jw7k51L44lxPxezIoiC4w?docId=CNG.dfed6bdcd8930778f0ca53ccf91435e1.71\">$7m from oil industry executives</a> at an election fundraiser in Texas.)</p> <p>But Obama hasn't exactly moved heaven and earth to differentiate himself from Romney on energy. Yes, he certainly talks up renewables more \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xsZ45Weng0\">latest campaign ad</a> shows him next to solar panels \u2013 but at his own fundraiser on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/23/romney-rolling-out-domestic-energy-plan/\">he said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Oil production is up. Natural gas is up. But we're also doubling the energy that we get from wind and solar. That is clean, it's renewable, it's homegrown, it's creating jobs all across America.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nowhere amid all this talk of energy independence was any explicit reference to the climate implications of increased exploitation of \"homegrown\" fossil fuels. While the subject remains utterly toxic for Republicans, even Obama rarely raises the topic these days. This week, an <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/245011-obama-spox-hints-climate-will-stay-in-campaign-background\">Obama spokesman indicated</a> that climate change would not be a major campaigning issue for Democrats:</p> <blockquote> <p>Clearly [climate change] is something that is important to the administration, but right now we are obviously going to be focusing on jobs and the economy and talking about what our contrast is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Signalling the intense frustration of environmental groups on this matter, the League of Conservation Voters has even <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/244813-enviros-want-climate-question-at-obama-romney-debate\">launched an online petition</a> urging PBS's Jim Lehrer, who will moderate the first presidential TV debate on 3 October, to ask a climate-related question.</p> <p>Even more revealing, a document will be released next week at the Republican convention that will likely shine a light on just how far down the political radar climate change has fallen over the past few years in the US since the heady days when Obama routinely mentioned it during his previous election campaign.</p> <p>At each convention, the political parties publish their \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/23/do-party-platforms-really-matter/\">platform</a>\" document. In essence, it is a manifesto that has been discussed and signed-off by a committee of party representatives from across all the states. During previous presidential election, the platform has been a largely symbolic and bureaucratic exercise. But the <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-08-23/politics/33322780_1_platform-committee-gay-marriage-human-life-amendment\">US media is signalling</a> this year that the platform documents will be more intensely scrutinised than before, in part due to the internal wrangles triggered by Todd Atkins.</p> <p>On Monday and Tuesday, the Republican platform committee <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/Events/Platform-Cmte-Sends-Platform-to-GOP-Convention-Delegates/10737433193-6/\">met in Tampa</a> in advance of the convention to finalise the document. Very little has been leaked to the press \u2013 <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/23/full-gop-platform-statement-on-abortion/\">bar the section on abortion</a> \u2013 but one member of the platform committee from West Virginia has given a teaser. Conrad Lucas, the state's Republican chairman, said in a report in the <a href=\"http://dailymail.com/News/election12/201208220233\">Charleston Daily Mail</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Once the platform is released, I think the voters in West Virginia are going to be very interested because of the pro-coal and natural gas positions that are in it\"\u2026<br>Lucas also offered an amendment during committee meetings this week to include a formal statement opposing Obama's cap-and-trade energy policy. <br>\"I was happy that we got opposition to cap-and-trade reinserted in the platform, which it wasn't in 2008,\" he said. \"It was unanimously approved, which I was excited about.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>West Virginia is well known as \"coal country\", but further south in Texas, where the oil industry dominates, the state's Republican platform document has been released online (<a href=\"http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/20...pdf?docID=3201\">pdf</a>). It provides an eye-popping insight into Republican thinking in that part of the country. It will certainly be interesting to see how much of it feeds into the national platform document, when it is finally published next week.</p> <p>It would be easy to be distracted by the extraordinary sections on homosexuality (\"contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God\") and the teaching of \"controversial subjects\" in schools (\"we believe theories such as life origins and environmental change should be taught as challengeable scientific theories subject to change as new data is produced\"), but let's stick to those tightly focused on energy and the environment...</p> <blockquote> <p>Protection from Extreme Environmentalists \u2013 We strongly oppose all efforts of the extreme environmental groups that stymie legitimate business interests. We strongly oppose those efforts that attempt to use the environmental causes to purposefully disrupt and stop those interests within the oil and gas industry. We strongly support the immediate repeal of the Endangered Species Act. We strongly oppose the listing of the dune sage brush lizard either as a threatened or an endangered species. We believe the Environmental Protection Agency should be abolished...</p> <p>Energy Strategy \u2013 We encourage a comprehensive energy policy that allows more development of domestic energy sources and reduces our need for foreign energy. Energy policy should be cooperative, economically viable without taxpayer funded subsidies, and environmentally safe, but not restricted by overzealous environmental activism. <br>Alternative Energy Sources \u2013 We encourage economically viable use of wind, coal-fired plants, solar, and nuclear power, and bio-sources without government subsidies. <br>Government Restrictions \u2013 We support immediate removal of government barriers to free market solutions to production and distribution of energy including restrictions on: drilling and production operations on public and private lands and waters refineries electric power generation and distribution federal gas mileage standards (CAF\u00c9 standards) and fuel blends.</p> <p>Cap and Trade \u2013 We oppose Cap and Trade (\"Cap and Tax\"). <br>U.S. Department of Energy \u2013 We support the elimination of the Department of Energy. <br>Incandescent Light Bulbs - We support the freedom to continue to use and manufacture incandescent light bulbs. <br>Keystone XL Pipeline \u2013 We support the immediate approval and construction of the Keystone XL and other pipelines that will reduce our reliance on imported oil and natural gas from unstable or unfriendly countries. <br>Deep Water Drilling \u2013 We support immediate resumption of deep water drilling and production in the Gulf of Mexico. <br>Land Drilling \u2013 We support land drilling and production operations including hydraulic fracturing. <br>Ethanol \u2013 We support the repeal of legislation mandating ethanol as fuel additives and/or primary fuel. <br>Natural Gas - Alternative Fuel - We urge the use of natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel and as complimentary fuel to gasoline and diesel. <br>We support the manufacture of vehicles that utilize natural gas as an alternative fuel and/or a complimentary fuel. <br>We support and encourage the conversion of existing private fleets to natural gas as a dual use fuel. <br>We support the use of natural gas in electric power generation and other industrial uses...</p> <p>United Nations \u2013 We support the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations and the removal of U.N. headquarters from U.S. soil. <br>United Nations Agenda 21 -The Republican Party of Texas should expose all United Nations Agenda 21 treaty policies and its supporting organizations, agreements and contracts. We oppose implementation of the UN Agenda 21 Program which was adopted at the Earth Summit Conference in 1992 purporting to promote a comprehensive program of sustainable development projects, nationally, regionally and locally. We oppose the influence, promotion and implementation of nongovernmental organizations, metropolitan and/or regional planning organizations, Councils of Government, and International Council for Local Environmental initiatives and the use of American (Texas) citizen's taxes to promote these programs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Remember that these are the official policy positions of the Republican party in one of the US's most populous and influential states. It remains to be seen next week how much of this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tea-party-movement\">Tea Party</a>-type of thinking filters through into the Republican's national platform document, but the statements above certainly provide a somewhat unpalatable <em>hors d'oeuvre</em>.</p>",

  "<p>So who's got the easiest run in then? Possibly table-topping<strong> San Jose</strong>, who have a home game heavy schedule, with an emphasis on teams with not a great deal to play for in their conference. This weekend they'll be facing a <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong> side who've had a truly underwhelming attempt to transform themselves this season. Behind San Jose, <strong>Sporting KC</strong> and <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> start the first of three games of mutually assured destruction this weekend, at Livestrong Park. We'll be covering that one live, as it's a sequence that may have a big say on not just the destiny of the East, but that of the Supporters Shield too.</p> <p>Also in the mix - <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong>, though they've lost two straight MLS games. They'll try to regroup at <strong>Philadelphia</strong> on Friday night, trying to at least enjoy a day's space from the teams on their shoulder in the West. Of those teams <strong>Vancouver</strong> go to <strong>Portland</strong> for another Cascadia derby, while the other regional rivals <strong>Seattle</strong> face a trip to <strong>Chivas</strong> on Saturday night. Busy weekend at the Home Depot Center, as the other tenants, <strong>Los Angeles Galaxy</strong>, face <strong>FC Dallas</strong> on Sunday evening - in what suddenly looks like an intriguing tie between two resurgent sides.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the East, <strong>Montreal Impact</strong> put their four-game winning streak on the line against a <strong>DC United</strong> side <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-22-dc-v-chi/highlights\">who dismantled Chicago in eye-catching fashion in midweek</a>. In the other midweek game, <strong>Columbus Crew</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-22-clb-v-tor/highlights\">completed their rescheduled fixture with Toronto FC with a victory</a>, and now host a <strong>New England Revolution</strong> side whose season has come off the rails. <strong>Toronto</strong> meanwhile, have to lick their wounds and head to <strong>Houston</strong>, where they actually <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-06-20-hou-v-tor/highlights\">gave Houston an almighty scare earlier this season</a>. Can they repeat or surpass that feat?</p> <p>Not daring to go anywhere such thorny questions unassisted, the Guardian has rounded up some of our gang of fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers to get their reaction to how the local sides have been doing and what they expect from this weekend's games. </p> <p>See what they have to say, leave your comments below, and join us for <strong>Sporting KC vs New York Red Bulls on Sunday at 9pm</strong>. And then join Joe Prince-Wright and myself on Monday morning for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/aug/20/mls-week-24-montreal-impact-new-yourk-red-bulls-steven-lenhart\">Five things we learned this weekend</a>. </p> <h2>Philadelphia Union vs Real Salt Lake, Fri 7.30 pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Dan Walsh</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://phillysoccerpage.com/\">Philly Soccer Page</a>:</p> <p>Philadelphia Union stole a draw Sunday at RFK Stadium, and they can thank referee Mark Geiger for that. Geiger waved off two D.C. United goals, one correctly, one dubiously. The Union simply couldn't handle the numbers United threw at them once Andy Najar shifted to right back in the second half and United sacrificed defense for offense. D.C. effectively contained playmaker Michael Farfan and cut off the runs that strikers Jack McInerney and Antoine Hoppenot have made a living off in recent weeks. This was the third time in two months the teams had played, and D.C. clearly learned a thing or two.</p> <p>On Friday, the Union host Real Salt Lake. They'll be without right back Sheanon Williams, who was sent off Sunday with two very disputable yellow cards. Rookie Raymon Gaddis will deputize, but all eyes will be on Zac MacMath. The rookie goalkeeper remains a talented shot-stopper but has looked shaky since suffering a concussion in the spring. If not for a Freddy Adu goalline clearance and Geiger's aforementioned calls, MacMath could have surrendered four goals Sunday. Speaking of Adu, the Union need him and newly acquired Danny Cruz to offer more options on the wings, because teams are keying on Farfan and McInerney. RSL deploys a much better back line than United, so it could be a struggle for the young Union, even at home.</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslsoapbox.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>For Real Salt Lake playing a fairly solid match on Saturday only to fall victim to a couple of counter attacks by FC Dallas that results in a 2-1 loss at home was painful, but bouncing back on Tuesday and picking up a 2-0 win in Champions League action over Tauro FC may have been just the medicine the team needed as they quickly packed up and headed east to take on the Philadelphia Union on Friday night. This will mark the first RSL match that will be on National TV this year as NBC Sports will broadcast the match, and for RSL they hope that keep their momentum from Tuesday alive. RSL will be looking to capitalize on the Union's struggles at home where they are just 5-5-1, RSL will most likely still be without Jamison Olave and Chris Schuler but will get Nat Borchers who was suspended on Tuesday in CCL back. Be on the lookout for Paulo Jr. who has been mighty good the last couple of matches and could play a major role for RSL again. Hard to pick a win on the road but I have to go with my gut and that is a 2-1 RSL win.</p> <h2>Montreal Impact vs D.C. United, Sat 4pm (TSN 2, RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>Did anyone predict 3 red cards, 2 penalty kicks and another Goal of the Week nominee before the Montreal Impact faced the San Jose Earthquakes? Not me. But no one is surprised by the quality of soccer that was displayed against the MLS leaders. Camara's and Lenhart's sendoff leveled the playing field but the Impact was still down 1-0 from a Wondolowski PK goal.<br> This is where the character and determination of the team mixed with Jesse Marsch's (and his staff) full confidence in his squad came through. As much as Marsch is a rookie head coach, there is nothing rookie about his MLS experience and feel for his players. With 4 wins in a row, the Montreal Impact will now host D.C United at Stade Saputo, in another 3-6-9-12 point game. No help from the midweek games in the East as both the Columbus Crew and D.C. United won their midweek games. Still, D.C United is still coming off a shaky stretch even after beating the Chicago Fire. A depleted Impact defense (injuries and suspensions) will look to step it up against what used to be a potent attack. I don't expect any ties at Stade Saputo and will take the biased route with a 1-0 win for Montreal. With a hot Marco Di Vaio, I don't see how a D.C. United defense could stop him for 90 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.blackandredunited.com/\">Black and Red United</a>, DC:</p> <p>D.C. United is in the middle of its most important stretch of the season. After hardly playing at all in June and July, the team suddenly faces a run of five matches in just 14 days. Two of those matches are in the books now already, as United was able to capture four points at home earlier this week with an infuriating draw against the Philadelphia Union and an impressive win over the Chicago Fire. The Union match featured a heaping portion of questionable calls from the referee that resulted in two potential winning goals for D.C. being taken off the board. United didn't dwell on the lost points though. They came back just four days later and extinguished the previously red hot Fire with a 4-2 result.</p> <p>United can now boast that they haven't lost a game at home since March 10th. Unfortunately the team hasn't fared as well on the road though. United is in prime position to make the MLS playoffs for the first time since 2007, but in order to go deep in the playoffs, they'll need to learn to win outside of RFK Stadium. They'll get the chance to do just that on Saturday night against a Montreal Impact side that is also far better on their home grounds than when traveling.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew vs New England Revolution, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>The Crew are in the middle of a tough stretch of seven games in twenty-one days. It is a great test of fitness and team depth. At Houston on Sunday the Massive Canaries blew a lead late in the game to sneak out of Houston with a draw. On Wednesday they went up two goals early only to let in another easy goal late and spent the final 20 minutes on their heels absorbing pressure from a less than stellar Toronto attack. Luckily, the Crew held on for all three points this time. On paper one would think the talk around Columbus would be a defense susceptible to giving up goals late in games, but it's not. All the talk is about Federico Higuain (Real Mardid's Gonzalo Huguain's brother).</p> <p>The Crew's newest Designated Player and highest paid player in club history already seems well worth the investment. He made his debut as a substitute on Sunday and started Wednesday amassing two assists and a goal in just 120 minutes of play. He has already established a fantastic on field rapport with the Crew's other Summer signing, Jairo Arrieta. And just like that, the Crew's attack seems formidable. There is a buzz and excitement not seen in this city in a couple years. The Crew are fun to watch again.</p> <p>This weekend New England comes to town. In their last seven games the Revs have lost five and drawn two. They are struggling to say the least. The Crew's new look offense gets another easy game to gel some more, but a few new faces may be in the line-up to keep legs fresh. Crew roll to an easy 3-1 victory as the Argentine talisman, Higuain, continues to impress.</p> <p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>:</p> <p>I don't even know where to start anymore, different week same frustration. Jay Heaps decided to change things up this week with his starting line-up, and shock is the word I would describe as how most of us felt when we heard Benny Feilhaber wasn't starting. Sure he hadn't been electric this season, but last couple games he had actually played decent. So was the benching for the new line-up or sending him a message about his attitude? Also, if he knew Lee Nguyen was injured pre-game why start him and risk further injury? This game started bad, 4 minutes in and a penalty was called, relieved it didn't come with a suspension. Most of us gathered at the bar in Cambridge for the viewing, agreed the PK was a fair call. There was a brief moment we were back in the game when it was tied up on a goal that I described as all the fluster of the game winning goal against Mexico earlier in the week and none of the class. When Chicago scored the second goal off a thrown in, I think most of us gave up on the game, and continued on with our beers.</p> <p>Against Columbus away, no shot: 3-0 Columbus. Then Wednesday the Revs welcome back Shalrie Joseph for a home game against Chivas. Mid-week game means even lower attendance so Shalrie will not get the proper send-off he earned with his many years in New England. Sorry Shalrie, hey you could be Steve Ralston or Taylor Twellman, they got less from the organization, and by less, I mean nothing. Chivas: 1- 0</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo vs Toronto FC, Sat 8.30pm (TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Meh. I mean, the Dynamo didn't lose but a 2-2 draw against the Crew left me unfulfilled. I think the annoyance comes from the fact that the Crew really did outplay the Dynamo. Even though Columbus is vastly improved thanks to their summer signings, I expected the Dynamo to come out stronger after the loss to NY. Still it's a point and I'll take it. </p> <p>Considering the Dynamo had a mid-week CCL match in El Salvador, my expectations were low. Then Houston won that without having to play several key starters and my hopes are now buoyed. Toronto played in the midweek as well using their normal lineup, so this actually might end up being a bit of an advantage for Houston. Let's be honest though, despite winning in Toronto a few weeks ago, we will owe TFC some payback from almost embarrassing us at home in June. Look for the Dynamo to get back to their winning ways on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>Boris Aguilar</strong>, Executive, <a href=\"http://www.redpatchboys.ca/\">Red Patch Boys</a>:</p> <p>Toronto FC has been struggling as of late. Over the weekend they fell 1-0 at homy to Sporting Kansas. Toronto played again on Wednesday night in Columbus and battled hard, but fell short and lost 2-1. Sadly, Toronto (5-15-5, 20 points) has fallen to 0-4-1 in the past five games. Lack of depth and an increased number of games has added to our struggles as of late. There are a number of injuries that are still keeping the bench thin. Our defense has been stretched thin and our strikers cannot find the back of the net. All of these variables together create a formula for disaster (which has been the theme for the season).</p> <p>Toronto is back on the road on Saturday travelling to Houston. In our last meeting at home Toronto fell short. The meeting before that, Toronto and Houston battled to a draw. One can hope that the team can find their winning way but with the recent amount of injuries and overall mount of games that they played, I don't see Toronto coming out on top. I see the side putting an a heck of an effort, and playing for the badge but I don't see a result. I predict a 2-1 Houston win.</p> <h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs Colorado Rapids, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Stade Saputo has been the cauldron for the Montreal Impact's hot streak of home victories, the latest of which came last week against the San Jose Earthquakes. For the Quakes, it was more of a house of cards: a 21st-minute altercation between San Jose's Steven Lenhart and Montreal's Hassoun Camara saw both players red carded; the resulting spot kick was converted by Chris Wondolowski for his league-leading 18th goal of the season. The Quakes lead lasted a fleeting two minutes before Di Vaio's equalizer, and Neagle's go ahead goal for the Impact, forced San Jose to push forward. The inevitable break away - Di Vaio's dash for goal - could only be nixed by last defender Jason Hernandez; a second red card and another Goonie was a goner. Bernier scored from the resulting penalty, sealing the game 3-1 in favor of the French-Canadian team. </p> <p>San Jose remains five points clear in the West as they return home to face the Colorado Rapids on Saturday. Quakes defender Victor Bernardez fell afoul of the MLS Disciplinary Committee on Tuesday and the absence of Bernardez, Hernandez and Lenhart might be compounded by the tweaked hamstring of speedy midfielder Shea Salinas. Defenders Ramiro Corrales and Ike Opara are likely to return to the back four with regulars Beitashour and Morrow. Up front, Alan Gordon (himself coming off of a two-game suspension) is likely to replace Lenhart as the target man up front with Wondo. This will be the week that Quakes fans find out whether our roster is as deep as we hope. Our own home streak remains unbroken this season, and even with the Rapids struggling in 8th place, they might prove the Quakes toughest home test to date. </p> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, COO, <a href=\"http://www.bulldogsupporters.com\">Bulldog Supporters Group</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>It's a familiar story in Rapidsland with the team taking the lead through a Brian Mullan goal against Chivas USA in a game that both sides desperately wanted to win. However we then let the 3 points slip through our fingers when a defensive mistake allowed Juan Pablo Angel to equalize in the 83rd minute.<br> It's not all bad as the capture of Honduran defensive midfielder &amp; national captain Hendry Thomas has genuinely excited the faithful. Thomas comes from Wigan Athletic, where he spent 3 years playing Premier League football against world class players week in, week out. Naturally a debate has arisen over whether his signing shuts the door on a potential return for Pablo Mastroeni, who is still out with concussion related symptoms, and even the future of fellow deep lying midfielder Jeff Larentowicz. Hendry, by his own admission is only about 70% match fit &amp; the Rapids have yet to receive the necessary transfer paperwork at time of writing, so we'll wait with interest to see his debut in the next couple of weeks. As for this weekend it's pretty simple really:<br>We are playing the league leaders.<br>At their place.<br>And we have lost our last 6 matches on the road. <br> <br>We'll pray for an upset but saying we'd be happy with a draw really is an understatement...</p> <h2>Portland Timbers vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Michael Pearson</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>30 minutes of entertaining, exciting and visually appealing soccer wasn't enough to secure another road point in New York and stretched Portland's winless streak to 8 games. Once again, the Timbers abandoned their more defensively resolute shape, playing a free-wheeling 4-3-3 - the gamble worked; for a time. The team found acres of space in the middle Zizzo's two assists and complete dominance led to Hans Backe pulling abused leftback Roy Miller in just the 36th minute, and replacing him with former Timber Kenny Cooper.</p> <p>From there, the match tightened up. The second half featured several 1v1 chances that the Timbers blew, which led to the seemingly inevitable New York winner at the death. So much of the Timbers season rolled up into one single match. There are positives to take away. Allowing the young guys to focus on getting forward and contributing offensively has seemed to spark the offense, and Zizzo, Songo'o and Nagbe all seem to be much more involved. But changes will have to be made, either to force the team to maintain its shape, or for major upgrades across the backline, for this new style to flourish in MLS in the coming years.</p> <p>Up next is playoff bound Vancouver in another Cascadia Cup show-down. This one is so hard to read, given the uneven play out of the Timbers recently - and the frankly stronger backline and forward corps of Vancouver gives me pause. Us losing Diego Chara hurts more than Vancouver missing Koffie (both to suspension), and the addition of Robson seems to weight the midfield towards the Whitecaps. Regardless, Jeld-Wen will be rocking, and if Timbers can keep up their new found goal scoring verve, a classic may be in store for those watching.</p> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>The Whitecaps are coming off two tough losses: a horrible defeat at home to a resurgent Dallas, then a toothless effort against play-off and Cascadia rivals Seattle. In both games we had slightly disjointed line-ups, and in the second were missing both our starting CBs. The loss to Seattle leaves us at the bottom of the Cascadia Cup race and just 5 points up on Dallas for the fifth and final play-off spot. No one played well against Dallas, a truly disappointing game to watch. At least against Seattle we played well for a portion of the game, though playing well didn't translate into creating chances, and not for the first time this season we went an entire game without registering a shot on net.</p> <p>On Saturday we face an improving Portland side that is finally finding its scoring touch, though their defence can't seem to get it together to match their attack. They've maintained a decent home form, while our away form is merely middling. The return from suspension of Barry Robson and Jay DeMerit from injury should give us hope, though we'll be missing midfielder Gershon Koffie, a young player who has shown very high quality and potential this season.</p> <p>Portland look dangerous on the counter lately, something Seattle used very well against us. Our fullbacks will need to be cautious and alert, especially if our CBs aren't fully in sync. Look for Mattocks and Richard to trouble the shaky Portland backline with their speed, especially if Portland press for the opening goal. With Robson, Thorrington and Davidson in the centre of our 4-3-3, we should dominate a weakened Portland midfield, and if Miller can find his scoring touch we could come away with 3 points. More likely is a hard-fought (and ultimately disappointing) draw.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs Seattle Sounders, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Last week, Chivas USA traveled to the Rocky Mountains to take on the Colorado Rapids, and try and jumpstart their push for the postseason. The ultimate result was mixed, however, as Chivas tied the Rapids 1-1. While Chivas desperately needed a win and three points against the inconsistent Rapids, they started the game very badly, and it appeared they would lose outright. Colorado midfielder Brian Mullan easily stripped the ball from new Goat Shalrie Joseph at the edge of Chivas' box, and put Colorado up 1-0 in the 19th minute. From there, it appeared that Chivas had no chance, but two second half subs, forwards Tristan Bowen and Juan Pablo Angel, linked up for an equalizer in the 83rd minute, and Chivas salvaged a point, somehow.</p> <p>This week, Chivas host the Seattle Sounders at the Home Depot Center. While the Sounders have had some ups and downs this season, they have been playing well lately in the league and will be a very dangerous opponent. For their part, Chivas must find a way to play good two-way soccer for 90 minutes, or else their hopes of moving up the standings will increasingly recede in 2012. Really, at this point, the Goats need to be picking up as many wins as possible, and fans are certainly hoping they can get the job done Saturday.</p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Its hard to ask for much more than a 2-0 shutout against the Whitecaps. Seattle controlled the flow of the game, played lock down defense by not allowing a single shot on target, and both forwards Fredy Montero &amp; Eddie Johnson each connected with the back of the net. It moved the Sounders back into the Supporters Shield race after former Sounder Lamar Neagle did us a solid and helped Montreal defeat league leading San Jose. </p> <p>This week the rave green face another familiar face in James Riley, as they travel to Carson to battle Chivas USA. Riley may no longer play for us, but his impact on the community is still felt to this day, as he's holding a 7 on 7 tournament this Sunday to benefit the local Boys &amp; Girls club in a city that he no longer lives in. We still love you, James - once a Sounder, always a Sounder. On to this matchup, I will say Chivas has made some interesting changes, and while its been difficult to gauge how new acquisition Shalrie Joseph is acclimating himself with their team, its hard to deny the improvements this franchise has made throughout the year. The only question is which Chivas will show up? Either way, it would be a bit of a let down if the Sounders didn't take 3 points on the road from this team, but it will be difficult getting balls past their keeper Kennedy, as I believe him to be one of the best keepers in MLS. I predict a 1-0 victory, and our keeper Gspurning to continue the dominant display between the sticks.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs FC Dallas, Sun 7pm (NBCSN, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p> <p>In a short week that saw the Galaxy trounce Chivas USA 4-0 on a Sunday, and then make a long trip to Columbus for a midweek clash with the Crew on a Wednesday, the 1-1 draw was both deserved and disappointing. A Goal by Robbie Keane in the second half of play leveled the score, but it was the constant pressure inside the Columbus half that should have resulted in a game-winner. But without Landon Donovan (US Men's National Team Duty) and David Beckham (Olympics) a 1 point result is palatable, especially against an emotional Columbus team playing their first game since the sudden passing of Kirk Urso.</p> <p>With the short break in league play, the Galaxy will now be able to set their focus on the start of the CONCACAF Champions League (CCL) on Thursday night against Isidro Metapan, before facing off in a Sunday matinee against a resurgent FC Dallas.&#xa0;Dallas has won their last two game on the road defeating both Vancouver and Real Salt Lake. And while FC Dallas looks to move into a playoff position it will be up to the Galaxy, currently in 4th place, to solidify their hold on their playoff hopes and put some distance between those scuffling to get into the picture.&#xa0;</p> <p>All three LA Galaxy designated players should be available for the upcoming matches, as well as the Championship back four of Dunivant, Gonzalez, DeLaGarza and Franklin. If Juninho can continue his improvements and the Galaxy find goals from Landon Donovan and Robbie Keane, look for the Galaxy to make a statement in both the CCL and League matches this week. Anything short of 3 points from Dallas would be a setback for the Galaxy.</p> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>The last game went well - any time you get 3 points at Rio Tinto you can't say many bad things. We scored a very late winner and the team just looked confident throughout - these two road wins are pretty huge given what's happened this season so far. I read a practice report from training the other day that said for the first time this season that nobody's rehabbing, so the team are getting their fitness back, but also their discipline too - the stupid cards have generally gone. I've been out of the country for a few weeks and when I left Brek Shea was in the doghouse - I get back and he's starring against Mexico and committing for Dallas. What caused the general turnaround? I hate to pin it on one player, but I think it really helps that David Ferreira is back. He's creating chances and making people around him raise their game.</p> <p>This weekend we're at LA - which is never an easy place to go. But we're coming off a win at Rio Tinto - something I've never been able to say before. And historically we've got results in Carson. There's no reason we can't get a draw in a very big game, given its play-off implications.</p> <h2>Sporting KC vs New York Red Bulls, Sun 9pm (ESPN2, ESPND, GOL TV Canada, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Guardian live game</strong></p> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting KC is coming off a 1-0 road win against Toronto FC - a win that put the team at the top of the Eastern Conference and two points ahead of this week's opponent, the New York Red Bulls. This is the first of three matches SKC and NYRB will play over the last three months of the season. The Eastern Conference is heating up, and no doubt, this match will be hard-fought for both teams.</p> <p>Against Toronto, the lone goal came from SKC's leading scorer, Kei Kamara. Expect Kamara to be a threat against NYRB as he and Teal Bunbury continue to work well with one another. That being said, an appearance by CJ Sapong as a substitute could very well produce the game winner. Last week, NYRB goal keeper Bill Gaudette came up strong for NYRB with some great saves in a 3-2 comeback at home against the Portland Timbers. Still, Gaudette will need help to shut down SKC's attack. SKC's strongest back line - Chance Myers, Matt Besler, Aurelien Collin and Seth Sinovic - will likely start and will work to stop NYRB Kenny Cooper's hunt for goals. Cooper is four goals behind the MLS leading scorer Chris Wondolowski of San Jose.</p> <p>Myers and Collin are each a yellow card away from a one-match suspension, but don't count on these guys being shy. SKC will play aggressively, fueled by the Livestrong Sporting Park atmosphere created by the very passionate Cauldron - something it will be without in its upcoming bouts against NYRB, to be played at Red Bull Arena.</p> <p><strong>Ian Thomson</strong>, <a href=\"http://thesoccerobserver.com\">The Soccer Observer</a>, New York:</p> <p>New York Red Bulls visit Kansas City Sunday after collecting just two points from their past six away games \u2013 a stretch including blowout losses in Chicago, New England, Montreal and Houston. Nine home wins have kept Hans Backe's extravagant $16 million squad in contention for the Supporters' Shield, though it remains unclear whether the Swedish head coach knows his strongest line-up. Top scorer Kenny Cooper sat on the sidelines again last weekend, displaced by Sebastien Le Toux, as Portland Timbers raced into a 2-0 lead at Red Bull Arena. Fortunately Backe has shed his aversion to the substitutes' bench this year. Cooper's first-half introduction saw him haul New York back into the game before whistle-happy referee Jasen Anno aided the comeback.</p> <p>Recent back-to-back clashes with Houston will have prepared New York for Sporting's 4-3-3 system. Peter Vermes' side has recovered from a mid-season slump, and Backe must find a way to combat Sporting's numerical superiority in central midfield \u2013 an issue he failed to address in Texas on Aug. 3. Backe's wide players must stay alert to the foraging runs of full-backs Seth Sinovic and Chance Myers. His defense, the fifth worst in the league, cannot be pulled out of shape by the criss-crossing runs of Kei Kamara, Teal Bunbury and Graham Zusi.</p> <p>Previous road performances suggest that this challenge could be beyond the Red Bulls.</p>",
  "<p>By <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/24/prince-harry-naked-pictures-sun?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">publishing a naked picture of Prince Harry</a>, the Sun has done what it has been doing ever since Rupert Murdoch first acquired it in 1969 \u2013 sticking up two fingers to the establishment.</p> <p>Daring to go where others fear to tread is in the paper's, and the publisher's, DNA. It has a tradition of upsetting the royal family (remember the bikini pictures of a pregnant Princess Diana, the toe-sucking pictures of the Duchess of York and the advance publication of the Queen's 1992 Christmas broadcast). With that history, we should hardly be surprised by its latest publish-and-be-damned decision.</p> <p>The timing, however, is an altogether different matter, and that has certainly increased the risk factor. A year ago its Sunday sister, the News of the World, was closed because of the phone-hacking scandal, which gave rise to the Leveson inquiry with its chairman currently preparing recommendations for a new form of press regulation. The Sun has also become embroiled in the affair, with its own reporters having been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/28/sun-arrests-rebekah-brooks?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">arrested by police investigating payments to public officials</a>. So it, and the humbled Murdoch, should surely be on the back foot. But a prince's wayward behaviour has given it a chance to do the opposite. It has revelled in the opportunity to revisit its old territory.</p> <p>Before considering whether or not that has been a wise move, let's clear up some misunderstandings. Claims that the press has been cowed by Leveson are well wide of the mark. What has happened in the last two days is no different from what would have happened before.</p> <p>Down the years, at various key moments, the royal family has pleaded for the tabloids to leave them alone. Everyone seems to have forgotten the relentless pursuit of Princess Margaret, let alone that of Princess Diana. Editors nodded politely, cleaned up their act for a week or two and then took up business as usual, citing public interest as a defence for their various intrusions. This high-minded justification cloaked the commercial reality: readers gravitated to papers that published royal tittle-tattle.</p> <p>Though it may be cynical to say it, Diana's death changed matters in the palace's favour. Editors desperate to placate readers in that bizarre period of public mourning amended their code and the Press Complaints Commission felt the wind of change. It acted on behalf of the royal family to secure special privileges of press restraint for Diana's sons and, in company with the monarch's lawyers, policed them vigorously.</p> <p>The PCC has always striven to suggest it is an equal opportunities body. But it cannot deny it has been particularly effective on behalf of the royals. Many pictures and stories have not seen the light of day. Prior restraint has worked wonders for the young princes.</p> <p>It is fair to say that the PCC has not acted as a censor. Its senior staff have made it abundantly clear that they do not act for the palace. They are merely messengers. It is for editors to decide whether to comply with requests they pass on. But the way in which the messages were couched is an important factor that we cannot know for sure. Did the PCC, in its role as royal postman, appear to endorse the message urging restraint?</p> <p>Then there is the role of the royal family's lawyers to consider. By sending letters to newspapers did they seek to imply that publication of this or that picture would be in breach of the law? If so, as the Sun has shown, this could well have been an empty threat.</p> <p>Though worried by the increasing use of human rights legislation protecting privacy, editors know that publication in the public interest remains a trump card. In the case of the Prince Harry photos, the Sun's public defence is pretty thin, but it isn't entirely without merit either. I would imagine a decent barrister making a fist of an argument about public concern for the prince's security and the potential for blackmail. Similarly, taking account of a previous PCC ruling, in which the commission cleared a magazine for publishing pictures of a woman without her permission because they were widely disseminated on the net, counsel would certainly argue that the same was true of the Harry pictures.</p> <p>There, of course, is the central point in the Sun's favour. Print is merely trying to reflect the reality of the internet. It may seem like a specious argument because it is up to a publication to uphold its own tastes and standards. There is plenty of stuff available on the net that no editor would wish, or dare, to publish.</p> <p>But the Sun will point out that readers have lapped it up. There will not be a repeat of the boycott, by readers or advertisers, that led to the demise of the News of the World. And there, of course, is the central problem facing Leveson, just as the good judge feared. The net is global. It crosses frontiers. It does not answer to national laws. It does not respect privacy. More than two years ago Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy\" title=\"\">said that privacy was dead</a>.</p> <p>None of this should be taken as support for the Sun, which was invading people's privacy long before Zuckerberg was born. It is, however, a lesson in the reality of the situation. The Sun's ethical boundaries are now set by social media. Leveson beware.</p>",

  "<p>Britain's slump into a second recession since the financial crisis began has officially run for nine months, with the Office for National Statistics' announcement that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/24/uk-gdp-revised-economy-double-dip\" title=\"\">the economy contracted by 0.5% in the second quarter of 2012</a>.</p> <p>The slump is not as big as first thought (the ONS originally estimated a contraction of 0.7%), but it is a recession nonetheless and one that is dividing the country and helping drag down the world economy.</p> <p>In London and the south-east prosperity is apparent. Most of the decline in unemployment over recent months has benefited this area. Likewise, Olympic shopping has largely favoured the southern half of the country, though the latest CBI retail figures show the Games effect has been overplayed.</p> <p>Not for nothing did Bovis Homes, one of the UK's major housebuilders, say recently it was safest to build new homes below a line drawn from Cheltenham in the west to Cambridge in the east.</p> <p>And there are large pockets of affluence in northern cities and towns where industries from cars to pharmaceuticals, plastics to telecoms continue to grow strongly.</p> <p>However, the growing numbers of long-term unemployed above the Bovis line and further west into Cornwall tell us about a persistent problem that this government has shown little inclination to tackle.</p> <p>The Treasury has promised a raft of measures to stimulate parts of the country the Olympics could reach. So far, there have only been promises, and the chancellor, George Osborne, has now been harried as much by his rightwing supporters as the opposition for some meaningful action.</p> <p>The delays are understandable when the proposals are convoluted attempts to re-invent off balance sheet government-backed investments. The multibillion pound road and other infrastructure projects under discussion will be partnerships with new arrangements that disguise the government money going into them because a straightforward purchase by the state would increase the national debt.</p> <p>Off balance sheet accounting is now a British disease and was a curse that afflicted the last Labour government, through its passion for PFI, as it does this one. The Treasury expends huge amounts of intellectual capital on these schemes while the unemployed sit on their hands, waiting for something to turn up.</p> <p>Osborne's tactics have also drag down world growth and helped destabilise the burgeoning number of countries that have come to depend on international trade for their prosperity.</p> <p>It would be unfair to just blame the Tory chancellor for the current global malaise. He is but one of many rightwing politicians who have spurned co-operation in favour of a go-it-alone austerity in the hope that the UK will be alright while others make their own way.</p> <p>As Adam Posen, the Bank of England monetary policy committee member, said this week, all the evidence is that the tactics adopted from Berlin to Vienna and London to Helsinki, have failed and Keynesian calls for co-operation and government-led solutions should have already been applied.</p> <p>We know Osborne is listening to thinktanks such as the Policy Exchange and business figures including Adrian Beecroft, who favour a bonfire of labour rights and steeper welfare cuts to stimulate demand among the unemployed for low-paid work.</p> <p>Of course you can easily create a Victorian world where the undeserving poor lurk down alleyways in no-go areas of town while the affluent live in gated communities. The deserving poor, who are willing to strive and get on their bike, win an endless stream of temporary jobs.</p> <p>The 1980s US comedy Roseanne revealed all we needed to know of life where workers with few qualifications hold down three part-time jobs to maintain a wage large enough to pay the mortgage and food bills.</p> <p>The US has many attributes, but it has little to teach us about how to create growth while promoting fairness. Someone who empties the bins doesn't need a degree or hand-wringing sympathy, just respect for the important job they do and a decent living wage.</p>",
  "<p>This week I helped launch the <a href=\"http://cfor.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Conservative Friends of Russia</a>, a group for those with an interest in Russian politics, history, business and culture. Our aim is to improve relations between the two countries, provide a forum for open debate and help to inform decision making in business and politics.</p> <p>The \"Friends of \u2026\" model is familiar within British political parties \u2013 there are many such groups including those dedicated to America, Israel, India, Poland and Azerbaijan \u2013 but there has never been one for Russia, which is unusual given the size of its economy and its importance on the international stage.</p> <p>Whether we like it or not, Russia is an influential and essential part of the international community and its importance will only grow over time. We need to stop making decisions based on misconceptions that are decades old, and deal with reality.</p> <p>Britain is in a difficult economic state and should be looking to remove barriers to trade and employment, particularly with a country bursting with natural resources. Currently, many businesses are struggling to trade because of visa complications that could be easily resolved by politicians, but few are prepared to sit down and listen to businessmen trading with Russia. We provide a forum to enable that engagement and to amplify the voices of the unheard.</p> <p>There are many areas of potential co-operation between the UK and Russia. Energy is an obvious one. With prices rising rapidly in Britain, why ignore the one country with an overwhelming amount of natural resources? Science and technology is another, with the two countries investigating co-operation in space.</p> <p>Increasingly in need of the finances brought by foreign students, UK universities welcome about 20,000 Russians each year. Surely we owe them a warm welcome and a positive learning environment rather than assuming they are all spies?</p> <p>We must remember, however, that being a Friend of Russia is not the same as being a Friend of the Russian government. By that reckoning, our Conservative members were not friends of Britain between 1997 and 2010 and we can assume that the entire British public colluded in the \"dodgy dossier\" and the expenses scandal. It is simply small-minded prejudice to discount a friendship group on the basis of the actions of the few. I've seen some astonishing examples of this in the past week.</p> <p>It's certainly not the easiest of times for a group with an interest in Russian politics. Some recent decisions have been alien to our way of thinking, given our now largely secular society and long history of democracy. Russia, on the other hand, is an extremely religious country and democracy there is only just approaching its 21st birthday. Rather than immediately denouncing everything we see, why not listen to the full arguments from a variety of sources and form an opinion based on facts and information rather than ignorance and emotive reflex?</p> <p>There will always be differences of opinion in politics and this is true between all nations. Each has to deal with its own unique circumstances and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. What is important is having a forum within which different opinions can be heard, exchanged and discussed, and this is the purpose of CFoR.</p> <p>We absolutely understood that we were embarking on a controversial project that many would try to strangle at birth. However, in contrast to the comments of armchair critics on Twitter who have not attended our events, my inbox is bursting with positive messages of support from attendees of all backgrounds \u2013 students, businesses, MPs, charities and cultural organisations. Many media outlets have praised our bravery in tackling a thorny but necessary subject. Certainly, our membership has expanded rapidly in the past few days. I like to live by the adage that fortune favours the bold, and I believe that beyond the initial hysteria, CFoR will have an extremely promising and positive future.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://thesullivanfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Leon H Sullivan Foundation</a>, founded on the legacy of the late civil rights leader and anti-apartheid pioneer Reverend Sullivan, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/22/equatorial-guinea-human-rights\" title=\"\">holding its ninth biennial Sullivan summit in Equatorial Guinea this week</a>. In doing so, it is disregarding a global standard of principles created by its namesake and championed by the organisation.</p> <p>The summit, whose theme is \"Africa rising\", is being billed, in part, as a human rights conference. The organisation's choice of host, Equatorial Guinea, has provoked an outcry from many African and international human rights groups over concerns that the summit will be used to polish the <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/equatorial-guinea\" title=\"\">tarnished human rights record</a> of Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. The Obiang regime, in power for 33 years, has been widely criticised for rights abuses, repression, and corruption.</p> <p>In response to critics, the foundation appears to have embarked on a public relations campaign for the Obiang regime. In <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flhsfound.accountsupport.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fgreen-apples%2Fimages%2FPress%2520Release%2520may%252010%5B4%5D.pdf&amp;ei=lVk3UIPFB8i-0QX3_YCIDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGw0riO1mDHDUX5QRqP7IUGiAutTg\" title=\"\">a May press release</a> (pdf), the foundation claimed that the Sullivan summit \"will showcase to the international community the advancement Equatorial Guinea has made in human development and the human rights arena\", and alleged that President Obiang is \"clearly misunderstood by western countries and human rights organisations\".</p> <p>On 6 August, the foundation's CEO, Hope Masters, challenged critics, referring to reports of abuse and corruption in Equatorial Guinea as \"outrageous\", \"tawdry\" and \"outdated\". She has accused her critics of failing to check facts or verify \"simple truths\".</p> <p>So we checked the facts and measured them against the <a href=\"http://thesullivanfoundation.org/about/global-sullivan-principles\" title=\"\">global Sullivan principles</a>, a corporate code of conduct initiated by Sullivan that remains a leading standard of corporate social responsibility championed by the Sullivan Foundation. If the principles were applied to the regime of President Obiang, would it pass the test? We tweaked the principles to make them applicable to a government instead of a corporation.</p> <h2>The global Sullivan principles of social responsibility</h2> <blockquote> <p>As a <strong>government </strong>which endorses the global Sullivan principles we will respect the law, and as a responsible member of society we will apply these principles with integrity consistent with the legitimate role of governing. We will develop and implement government policies, procedures, training and internal reporting structures to ensure commitment to these principles throughout our government. We believe the application of these principles will achieve greater tolerance and better understanding among peoples, and advance the culture of peace. Accordingly, we will:</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Principle No 1: </strong>Express our support for universal human rights and, particularly, those of our citizens, the communities within which we operate, and parties with whom we do business.</p> <p><strong>Regime of President Obiang's record:</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2011/af/186191.htm\" title=\"\">US State Department reports the occurrence of \"[m]ajor human rights abuses</a>,\" including arbitrary arrest or detention, torture, harassment, denial of basic political rights, and extreme censorship.\"</p> <p><strong>Principle No 2: </strong>Promote equal opportunity for our citizens at all levels of society with respect to issues such as colour, race, gender, age, ethnicity or religious beliefs, and operate without unacceptable citizen treatment such as the exploitation of children, physical punishment, female abuse, involuntary servitude, or other forms of abuse.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record:</strong> Human rights abuses in Equatorial Guinea include \"discrimination against women; trafficking in persons; discrimination against ethnic minorities; and restrictions on labour rights\", according to the US State Department.</p> <p><strong>Principle No 3: </strong>Respect our citizens' voluntary freedom of association.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>Civil society <a href=\"http://egjustice.org/sites/default/files/EITI%20Civil%20Society%20Report%20-%20Final%20Published%20Version%20Color.pdf\" title=\"\">activities are restricted</a> (pdf). The government <a href=\"http://www.egjustice.org/post/liberty-denied-equatorial-guinea\" title=\"\">has thwarted</a> several recent attempts to hold peaceful protests. In 2012, the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c2252c,4565c25f35f,4fd8895128,0,,,GNQ.html\" title=\"\">UN refugee agency reported</a> that \"[t]rade union rights are non-existent and independent unions have never been allowed to register\". The government limits freedom of movement through the use of security checkpoints.</p> <p><strong>Principle No 4: </strong>Enable citizens to meet at least their basic needs and provide the opportunity to improve their skill and capability in order to raise their social and economic opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>Despite the country's oil revenues, in its <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3011/516560ESW0GQ0P00disclosed0120130110.pdf\" title=\"\">public expenditure review of the country</a> (pdf), published in 2010, the World Bank reported that the standard of living of most of the population \"has not significantly budged and poverty is widespread\". It said public funding of the education sector was insufficient and \"well below the expenditure of countries in the region\". Consequently, only one in two students completes primary education. In 2011, the <a href=\"http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/GNQ.html\" title=\"\">government spent just 0.7% of GDP on education</a>, far below the average 3.9% spent by other sub-Saharan African countries. In addition, a majority of the population <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/16/equatorial-guinea-unesco-s-shameful-award\" title=\"\">still lacks adequate access</a> to basic services such as electricity and running water.</p> <p><strong>Principle No 5: </strong>Provide a safe and healthy place to live; protect human health and the environment; and promote sustainable development.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>According to <a href=\"http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2011.pdf\" title=\"\">the UN</a>, nearly one in eight children die before age five in Equatorial Guinea. The World Bank said in its 2010 report that, unlike most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, Equatorial Guinea has the financial means to improve the health of its population, but that \"insufficient resources [are] allocated to the health sector, as evidenced by the general deterioration of facilities, the breakdown of medical equipment, and the inability of the budget to cover remuneration of personnel.\"</p> <p><strong>Principle No 6: </strong>Promote good governance including respect for intellectual and other property rights, and not offer, pay or accept bribes.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>Government corruption is widespread. Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/13/france-arrest-warrant-equatorial-guinea\" title=\"\">French authorities issued an arrest warrant</a> for the president's son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang, and seized property in Paris worth millions of dollars. The US also accuses him of looting more than $100m from Equatorial Guinea to spend on luxury goods.</p> <p><strong>Principle No 7: </strong>Work with civil society and communities to improve the quality of life in those communities \u2013 their educational, cultural, economic and social well being \u2013 and seek to provide training and opportunities for citizens from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>Freedom House gives Equatorial Guinea <a href=\"http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2012/equatorial-guinea\" title=\"\">its worst rating for civil liberties</a>. Government officials have monitored the activities of political opposition members, civil society, and journalists.</p> <p><strong>Principle No 8: </strong>Promote the application of these principles by those with whom we do business.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>The government requires foreign companies to abide by local content laws and to invest in social development projects in the country.</p> <p><strong>Principle No 9: </strong>We will be transparent in our implementation of these principles and provide information that demonstrates publicly our commitment to them.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>The government has <a href=\"http://egjustice.org/sites/default/files/open_budget_index_2010_equatorial_guinea.pdf\" title=\"\">failed to publish budget information</a> (pdf), making it difficult for people to assess government performance or accountability.

That is freedom of extortion and blackmail,\" he said in response to concerns about recent crackdowns on private news organisations.</p> <p>Days before the Ecuadorean government granted asylum to the WikiLeaks founder and promoted itself as a guardian of freedom of expression, riot police in Quito raided the offices of one of the country's leading magazines, Vanguardia. They confiscated journalists' computers and prevented publication for a week, ostensibly as a punishment for labour law violations.</p> <p>It was the second time in less than two years that Vanguardia had been raided. Its journalists are also getting death threats after being denounced by the president during his weekly TV show, and the magazine's editorial director was recently sued by Correa for $10m in \"moral damages\" for suggesting the president knew his brother was making millions of dollars from state contracts.</p> <p>After a public outcry, the president withdrew one suit and issued a pardon in the other, but he defended his right to take such action: \"Do we have an unwritten law that we can't sue a journalist? Since when? So nobody should sue Murdoch and his partners in crime in Britain?\"</p> <p>The editorial director of Vanguardia, Juan Carlos Calder\u00f3n, had earlier told the Guardian he was being targeted for criticising the administration, and accused Correa of double standards. \"The government said it has granted asylum to Assange because he is politically persecuted for defending freedom of expression. But the same thing happens to us,\" he said. \"This is not a country with the free press described by Correa.\"</p> <p>He is not alone. The domestic press watchdog Fundamedios describes the situation in Ecuador as a low-intensity war on journalists that appears to be escalating. Last year, it recorded 151 cases of physical aggression against reporters, up from 101 in 2009. It says this increase is largely the result of the constant abuse directed at journalists by Correa during his weekly TV broadcast, which is carried by almost every channel.</p> <p>It also notes that 17 radio stations have been shut down this year for transgressing regulations and that the government has recently issued new rules that will oblige internet service providers to provide the IP addresses of their users to the authorities, even without a court order.</p> <p>\"There is a huge gap between what Correa says about press freedom and reality,\" said C\u00e9sar Ricaurte, head of Fundamedios. \"If Assange were Ecuadorean, I dare say he would already be in jail.\" International free press campaigners, including the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders, have also accused Correa of trying to discredit and intimidate critics.</p> <p>Correa said such judgments were misguided. \"The Ecuadorean and Latin American press is not like the European or North American press, which has some professional ethics. They are used to being above the law, to blackmail, to extort. I am sorry about good people on an international level who defend this kind of press.\"</p> <p>He denied that radio station closures were politically motivated, saying some were simply music channels that failed to conform to broadcasting rules. This will open up space for more public channels.</p> <p>An insight into Correa's strategy was given by his chief communications adviser, Fernando Alvarado who described the media as \"weeds that need to be cleaned\" and replaced by flowers (public and community media outlets) in a recent interview with the Mexican publication Gatopardo.Since Correa \u2013 a US-educated economist who describes himself as a moderate leftist \u2013 came to power in 2007, there has been a wider range of state and private ownership of newspapers and TV stations. There is more scope for critical non-governmental organisations and greater access to senior officials. The interviews given by Correa on Thursday were carefully staged in terms of lighting and camera work, but unscripted.</p> <p>Media watchers said Correa's approach -\u2013 particularly in his weekly live broadcasts \u2013 was as confrontational as that adopted by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, but less destructive. \"In some regards, it is like Ch\u00e1vez. But Ch\u00e1vez went too far. Though there is confrontation here, no TV stations have been closed, which was the case in Venezuela,\" said Maurice Cerbino, a professor at Andina Simon Bolivar University. The confrontation, he said, was understandable given the previous situation in Ecuador in which the private media colluded with the government.</p> <p>Correa's supporters say the administration is carrying out an overdue rebalancing of the media, which was previously skewed too heavily towards private ownership by a handful of families. When Correa came to power in 2007, there was only one public media organisation, Radio Nacional.</p> <p>Those who work in public media say this has created a far healthier media environment because advertisers have less influence. \"The reports by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty are not false, but a lot of them are exaggerated,\" said Orlando P\u00e9rez, the editorial director of El Tel\u00e9grafo.</p> <p>\"Ecuador is going through a golden age for media freedom. Citizens now have so much space for expression, through social networks, public media, community media as well as blogs and websites.\" To demonstrate his editorial independence, he pointed to a front-page story in his public newspaper exposing a corruption in the state-owned oil company PetroEcuador.</p> <p>P\u00e9rez claims to have set the stage for Assange's first interview with Correa, which later lead to asylum. He denies that this has anything to do with a government strategy. \"We didn't choose Assange. Assange chose us,\" he said.</p> <p>Correa said he was trying to support an individual threatened by a powerful state. \"I don't agree with everything Mr Assange did. I never said that. But I believe he is entitled to a just legal process,\" the president said. \"Assange never stole the information. It was handed to him by Bradley Manning. He just distributed it. So why didn't the newspapers that published it also get sanctioned? That is an international double standard. The answer is that the newspapers have power, whereas Mr Assange is just a citizen. That is why certain countries want to crush him with all their weight.\"</p> <p>His motives are widely disputed. Some accept the president's idealistic claims. Cynics say he is trying to distract attention from the criticism of his heavy handling of the domestic media. Another theory is that he is a political opportunist who understands the benefits of picking high-profile fights, in this case, with the UK. Having gone further than any other Latin American leader outside of Argentina in criticising Britain over the Falklands earlier this year, he has now found a new cause. William Hague's threat to remove the diplomatic status of the Ecuadorean embassy simply played into his hands.</p> <p>\"The UK foreign minister has given him the perfect excuse to unite the left in a confrontation with imperialists,\" Calder\u00f3n observes. \"People on the left have an anti-imperialist gland. All you have to do it touch it to secrete anthems (of solidarity).\"</p> <p>But the decision to grant asylum has made waves inside Ecuador's government. Career bureaucrats are uneasy at a decision made by political appointees. Some feel it is of dubious legality and could backfire in terms of trade with the European Union. On the streets, however, the move appears to have widespread public backing. There were demonstrations of support in Quito this week. Women's groups have even seconded Correa's claim that the accusations against Assange would not constitute felonies in Latin America.</p> <p>\"I totally agree with the decision to grant asylum to Assange,\" said Virginia G\u00f3mez, former director of the Attention and Help Centre for Women. \"The allegations against Assange would not be crimes here. Women are empowered, but not to the point that if a condom breaks it is a sex crime. That is beyond our imagination.\"</p> <p>Quito is no place for the politically half-hearted. Local people are proud of their radicalism and burn effigies of politicians \u2013 including the current president \u2013 at raucous New Year's Eve parades. Many feel it is their duty to kick out poorly performing leaders, something they have done with remarkable regularity.</p> <p>After just five years in power, Correa is the longest-serving president in a century. US embassy cables leaked by WikiLeaks described him as the most popular president the country had ever had. Without exception, everyone interviewed for this story said Correa had been good for Ecuador. Even the fiercest critics of his media policies praised the president's work on health and education. As his cavalcade drove up to the interview venue, girls leaned out of the window and screamed as if they had seen a rock star.</p> <p>The question now is whether the Assange case will consolidate or erode this popularity if it drags on until the presidential elections next February. Correa was unwilling to speculate. \"I am an economist, not an astrologer. I can't say how long it will take. It could be solved tomorrow. It depends on the UK. Or it could take a long time. What is the next step? Keep talking. We have never closed the door to conversation. From the beginning, we have been talking to Britain, Sweden and even the USA to solve this situation. But we will never lower our principles or risk the life or rights of Assange.\"</p>",
  "<p>Science is no longer seen as the preserve of privileged men, and the diversity of science broadcasters and writers means that most aspiring scientists can find someone to relate to, but what of engineering?</p> <p>We don't see many practising engineers in the media (BBC2's recent <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01l40c5/broadcasts/upcoming\" title=\"\">Engineering Giants</a>, which put engineer Rob Bell at the forefront, was an honorable exception). It's even less common to hear from a female engineer. Where is an aspiring engineer \u2013 especially a young woman \u2013 to find her role model? The answer may lie in a rather surprising place: the world of motorsport.</p> <p>This weekend, the <a href=\"http://www.fiawec.com/\" title=\"\">FIA World Endurance Championship</a> comes to the UK, with the Six Hours Of Silverstone race kicking off at midday on Sunday. On the face of it, events like these are male-dominated. All but one of this year's championship drivers are men, with Japan's <a href=\"http://www.lemans.org/en/races/fia-world-endurance-championship/updates/interview-with-keiko-ihara-the-only-female-driver-in-the-fia-wec_6519.html\" title=\"\">Keiko Ihara</a> being the single exception. Behind the scenes, however, an increasing number of women are building a career in motorsport engineering.</p> <p>Teena Gade is one of those. She is a vehicle dynamics researcher at <a href=\"http://wwwm.coventry.ac.uk/ECBusinessServices/Pages/home.aspx\">Coventry University</a> and a consultant to the motorsport industry. She's only 33, but her career has already encompassed stints as an aerodynamicist with the Williams Formula One team, and working as a rally engineer with <a href=\"http://www.prodrive.com/\" title=\"\">Prodrive</a>.</p> <p>Teena tells me she loved motorsport from a young age, but did she have any female role models as a child?</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, no. That said, I don't think I ever sought a female role model \u2013 just <em>a</em> role model. Formula One inspired me to take up a career in engineering, and my role models were Patrick Head and Adrian Newey. I was never exposed to the idea that there were things women didn't do.\"</p> <p>There is an upwards trend in the number of women engineers, Teena says. \"But I'm disappointed to say that it's still a surprise to meet another woman working in my environment.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395164219\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345808636747/Motorsport-engineer-Teena-008.jpg\" alt=\"Motorsport engineer Teena Gade\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gade combines her work as a vehicle dynamics researcher at Coventry University with her role as a motorsport consultant. Photograph: Teena Gade</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teena Gade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How does she feel, then, about being a role model for young women who may be thinking of an engineering career? Ambivalent, is the answer. \"In a way, I wish I wasn't picked out as a role model: not because I don't wish to inspire the next generation; more because I know that I have been singled out for my gender and it bemuses me that we even talk about gender in 2012. That said, it's incredibly rewarding to stand in front of young women and show by example that the hurdles are easily cleared.\"</p> <p>Bernadette Collins of <a href=\"http://www.mclaren.com/home/\" title=\"\">McLaren Racing</a> expresses similar sentiments. She's a mechanical design engineer and an ambassador for the government's <a href=\"http://makeitingreatbritain.bis.gov.uk/favicon.ico\" title=\"\">Make it in Great Britain</a> campaign, currently exhibiting at London's Science Museum.

Photograph: McLaren</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadette Collins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like Teena, Bernadette grew up with a fascination for Formula One engineering and never considered the gender of the people behind the technology. It remains a non-issue for her. \"We've got some of the best engineers in the business,\" she tells me. \"Whether it's a male or a female doing the job really doesn't matter.\"</p> <p>But isn't it difficult to be in the minority? \"I've never really noticed it,\" she says. \"The number of women in engineering and motorsport is increasing all the time, and I wouldn't want any young female engineers to be put off by a so-called gender division.\"</p> <p>Rather than focus on \"female engineers\", Bernadette wants to give people a clearer idea of who engineers are and what they do, regardless of gender. \"When I tell some people I'm a mechanical engineer, they think I'm a mechanic,\" she tells me. \"Their view of engineering is wrong, and that's because there isn't enough information out there. So I think recognisable engineering role models are important, whether they are male or female.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395164221\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345810411102/Motorsport-sisters-Teena--010.jpg\" alt=\"Motorsport sisters Teena and Leena Gade\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motorsport engineering sisters Leena and Teena Gade. Photograph: BMW Group</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BMW Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The visibility of engineers, and the understanding of what they do, is improving. The Guardian has showcased the career of Audi Sport race engineer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/apr/28/leena-gade-female-motorsport-engineer\" title=\"\">Leena Gade</a> (the Gade surname is no coincidence: Leena is Teena's sister), and Richard Hammond's recent TV series <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011dcb2\" title=\"\">Engineering Connections</a>, and Engineering Giants, have certainly made engineering concepts more accessible.</p> <p>Teena also singles out the BBC's Formula One coverage: \"The engineers are major characters in the pre-race interviews \u2013 they're there, onscreen, with their name and job title given. You don't often see that degree of attention given to engineers.\"</p> <p>What insights can these role models offer aspiring motorsport engineers - of either gender? \"Working in academia means that you get to explore beyond safe confines and develop a true understanding of the science behind motorsport,\" says Teena. On the racetrack, the pace and nature of the work is quite different: every deadline is immediate, so decisions are taken based on what engineers already know. It's undeniably exhilarating: \"I'm getting the best of both worlds, because I am working across the two environments.\"</p> <p>But it's best to start with a solid foundation in basic engineering. \"Definitely take one of the traditional engineering courses, like mechanical engineering, rather than the more vocational degrees,\" Teena advises. \"Formula One teams, especially, like someone that they can build up and train, and mechanical engineering gives you the basic foundation to build that training on.\"</p> <p>Expect hard, but highly rewarding, work. Bernadette's career path, from <a href=\"http://www.formulastudent.com/\" title=\"\">Formula Student</a> to her present role at McLaren Racing has allowed her to work on some \"amazingly cool\" projects. \"Our work involves being creative and overcoming design challenges \u2013 not assembling greasy machinery in a workshop. We don't fit the old engineering stereotypes.\"</p>",

  "<p>Welcome to the weekly roundup from the Guardian healthcare network.</p> <p>The big story, and key talking point of the week, was the government suggestion that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/aug/21/nhs-brand-sold-overseas-hospitals\">hospitals could sell their services abroad</a>. Sarah Boseley reported for the Guardian that the government thinks there could be lucrative possibilities for NHS-standard healthcare services in growing markets such as India and China. </p> <p>Commentator Roy Lilley noted an <a href=\"http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Chutzpah.html?soid=1102665899193&amp;aid=fLCv5vqyswI\">apparent about-turn in ministers' views oft the health service</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A year ago [NHS staff] were being told they were useless. Management costs too high, outcomes poor, the British public deserved better. They will remember, in January 2011, LaLa telling the Times Newspaper:<br>'Modernising the NHS is a necessity.... we need to take steps to improve health outcomes, bringing them up to the standards of the best international healthcare systems.'<br>... None of it was true. The 'Liberated' NHS has lead to a centralised muddle with no built-in improvements for choice or quality and we all know it. <br>However, yesterday we were invited to forget all that. Suddenly the NHS is world-class. Overnight the NHS is not only a national asset, it is an international asset. </p> </blockquote> <p>Lilley and Pulse magazine also pointed out the similarity of the proposal to NHS Global, set up by then health secretary Andy Burnham in 2010 to help the health service make the most of the overseas market. Pulse acting editor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenowottny/status/237837697681616897\">Steve Nowottny tweeted</a>:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/stevenowottny/status/237837697681616897\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Selling NHS brand abroad is nothing new - this morning's headlines seem like a reboot of the 'NHS Global' idea <a href=\"http://t.co/edEHK1TZ\" title=\"http://bit.ly/uc99tP\">bit.ly/uc99tP</a></p>&mdash; Steve Nowottny (@stevenowottny) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenowottny/status/237837697681616897\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-21T09:05:00+00:00\">August 21, 2012</a></blockquote> <script src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> </figure>  <p>And a Pulse headline dubbed it <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/comment-blogs/-/blogs/14455709/nhs-abroad-plans-are-a-severe-case-of-darzi-deja-vu\">\"a severe case of Darzi d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\"</a>.</p> <p>But writing for the network, our columnist Richard Vize, argued that working internationally <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/healthcare-network/2012/aug/23/nhs-overseas-franchise-health-service\">will encourage the best hospitals to stay at the forefront of modern practice</a> and benefit patients. He wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Working internationally need not be a distraction from the pursuit of greater productivity at home. Indeed, some of the most exciting developments in countries such as India and Brazil are focused on delivering high quality at low cost. The Aravind eye care system in India is just one example from which the NHS can learn. The NHS as a whole is often slow to adopt new approaches to care; more international work can help push reform through the system.</p> </blockquote> <p>In the Telegraph, Dan Hodges <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100177419/setting-the-nhs-up-overseas-is-a-brilliant-idea-the-left-cant-carry-on-trying-to-preserve-the-health-service-in-aspic/\">described the proposals as a brilliant idea</a> and asked why no one had thought of it before (well, see above for an answer on that one). He wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>today's reforms should be welcomed. If successfully implemented they will generate new, if relatively minor, income streams. They will send the message, internally as well as externally, that innovation does have a place within the NHS. And it will also help settle the age old argument between Left and Right about where the NHS stands in terms of international health care comparisons.<br>I don't love the NHS. But I appreciate its value as a public service. And if patients in New York and Paris and Berlin come to value it as well, great. I can see the Broadway billboards now: \"NHS. If you liked the Danny Boyle musical, you're going to love the bypass\".</p> </blockquote> <p>For the Independent, Mark Steel wrote that the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/mark-steel/mark-steel-exporting-the-nhs-wont-make-it-better-8069907.html\">health service has a global reputation not because it's a brand, but because it's free</a>.

  "<p>Money talks and in football it seldom lets anything else get a word in edgeways. For Manchester City, however, the power of the chequebook is being challenged by other more profound considerations.</p> <p>While the approach of the summer transfer deadline has produced the usual feverish activity in the market amid much speculation about the likely comings and goings, the one feature that stands out is the lengthening list of players not wanting to enjoy the riches on offer at the Etihad Stadium.</p> <p>This week Daniele De Rossi, the gifted Roma midfielder long sought after by Roberto Mancini, became the latest to turn City down. Mancini wanted Robin van Persie but he opted for Manchester United. Lille's Eden Hazard was another target but the Belgian joined Chelsea where he is already shaping up as the reincarnation of Gianfranco Zola. Daniel Agger might be in City's squad now had Liverpool been prepared to lower an asking price of \u00a327m for the defender which the Premier League champions were not prepared to meet.</p> <p>While all these players would have benefited financially from joining Manchester City it seems the need to play regular first-team football persuaded them to go elsewhere or, in De Rossi's case, stay put. Almost certainly Van Persie will start more matches for Manchester United this season than he would have done had he signed for City, even with Sergio Ag\u00fcero now out of action for a few weeks.</p> <p>Mancini has complained about his club's lack of transfer activity this summer and as City begin to defend their Premier League title while striving to make significant progress in the Champions League his desire to strengthen the squad is natural, Uefa's imminent restraint on extravagant spending notwithstanding. Yet the reluctance of some leading players to enter an environment which would find them starting more than a few games on the substitutes' bench is understandable.</p> <p>Footballers want to play football whether it is in a public park on a Sunday morning or to the roars of the crowd in the Premier League. A player given the opportunity of signing for Manchester City, Manchester United or Chelsea has to weigh the chance of making a substantial sum of money with the long-term effect on his playing career. Too many big signings have gone broody on the bench for this to be overlooked.</p> <p>Take Dimitar Berbatov, and presumably United hope that someone will before next week's transfer deadline. Four years ago Sir Alex Ferguson signed the Bulgarian stroller from Tottenham for \u00a330.75m. Manchester City were hovering and the word was that Ferguson smuggled him into Old Trafford hidden in the back of his car. Apocryphal perhaps but it added a nice touch of intrigue to the story.</p> <p>Berbatov's time at Old Trafford, however, can hardly be rated a success. While his thoughtful style and subtle skills have produced some memorable moments he has seldom looked an integral part of a team whose energetic style leaves little room for Berbatov's brand of quiet counterpoint. Last season he made only a dozen appearances in the Premier League but still scored seven goals, two of them from penalties. It has all seemed a bit of a waste.</p> <p>The same day in 2008 that Berbatov joined United, Abu Dhabi bought Manchester City and immediately pipped Chelsea for Robinho, who arrived from Real Madrid for \u00a332.5m. The Brazilian seemed a mite confused. \"Chelsea made a great proposal and I accepted,\" he told reporters. \"You mean Manchester, right?\" \"Yeah, Manchester, sorry!\"</p> <p>That season Robinho was City's leading scorer with 14 goals. The following season he was injured for three months and scored once (against Scunthorpe in the FA Cup) before returning to his home club, Santos, on a six-month loan. Eventually he joined&#xa0;Milan.</p> <p>Given their time over again both Berbatov and Robinho might have done things differently. In each case the money turned out to be better than the move. Rather like Andy Carroll, who cost Liverpool \u00a335m when Kenny Dalglish signed him from Newcastle at the beginning of 2011 but last weekend was kept on the bench by Brendan Rodgers until the last 11 minutes of the 3-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion.</p> <p>The day Carroll moved to Anfield Liverpool sold Fernando Torres to Chelsea for \u00a350m. Torres may yet be a success and the fact Hazard, unlike Robinho, preferred Stamford Bridge to the Etihad could help make this happen.</p>",
  "<p>In Sweden, the trend towards supporting more social entrepreneurs and greater social innovation has visibly gained pace during recent years. Due in part to a shift in public perception, this form of entrepreneurship with societal benefits is fast gaining recognition as an important constituent in the development of a sustainable society \u2013 in ecological, social and financial terms.</p> <p>There has, of course, always been a presence of organisations with good purposes and enthusiasts with good hearts. But developments in information technology and the digitalisation of media have created new possibilities for these enthusiasts, at the same time as climate threats, global injustices and financial crises have created the urgent need for new, creative solutions.</p> <p>A Swedish example when it comes to injustices in our society is for instance <a href=\"http://socialinnovation.se/en/hopeful-staffing/\" title=\"\">Hopeful Staffing</a>, the world's first agency for homeless people. Fighting climate threats is for instance <a href=\"http://adoptabee.se/blog/in-english/\" title=\"\">Adopt a bee \u2013 Honey for free</a>. <a href=\"http://www.solvatten.se/\" title=\"\">Solvatten</a> (translated; \"Sunwater\"), is a business who has invented a household water treatment unit, which saves lives.</p> <p>In Sweden, social entrepreneurship is generally understood as an entrepreneurship whose core activity not only generates income for its owner and employees, but also in a visible and preferably accountable way provides a positive impact on individuals and society: locally, regionally or globally. As a result of the financial and administrative support which enables the establishment of different networks for social innovations, several interesting arenas have arisen.</p> <p>Most platforms of this kind serve the purpose of supporting research, knowledge and competence within the growing areas of social innovation and social entrepreneurship, often consisting of concrete, mutual projects and new sustainable models of business where innovative products and services are developed. Ideas-driven and ruled by principles, the social entrepreneur in Sweden focuses on activity which allows for the possibility of enlargement from local to global level \u2014 activity that changes structures in its foundation and re-invests profit. These entrepreneurs are found in \"new business\" \u2014 within sustainable technology, within the \"new public service\" for people who are excluded, with the \"new NGOs\" \u2014 where business logic is used to enhance effectiveness and benefit the activity.</p> <p>An interesting Danish example of new business, also with focus on global injustice, can be found in <a href=\"http://www.baisikeli.dk/\" title=\"\">Baisikeli</a>, who focuses on expanding cycling culture in both Denmark and developing countries. <a href=\"http://kladoteket.se/\" title=\"\">Kl\u00e4doteket</a> (translated; \"Clothetique\"), is a business which works as a library for funny and unique clothes.</p> <p>Currently, Sweden is considering the balance between governmental/municipal control and governmental/municipal support \u2014 a relationship that may be <a href=\"http://www.naringsbloggen.se/innovation/\" title=\"\">most evident in a blog that is driven by the government</a> (the ministry of enterprise, energy and communications), in which both officials and guest bloggers have the opportunity to contribute their thoughts and opinions on \"the way to the new innovation strategy in Sweden\". The new innovation strategy has yet to arrive in Sweden, \u2014 this much is made clear in the blog \u2014 but what does this say about the current policy? Politicians and officials assign themselves the authority to create a strategy that clearly would be best developed by social entrepreneurs. Social innovation in its true sense is initiative taken by social entrepreneurs in order to address something in society they believe needs to be changed or improved.</p> <p>Social innovation can serve as the driving force in solving these persistent social and economic problems. The social entrepreneur may even work across borders to break up existing structures. That public institutions do not find it easy to renew themselves is expected, and as it should be, but in recognising this they must \"keep their fingers away\" from social innovation, instead giving maximum support to the movements and phenomena whose very purpose is to create a better society. Rephrasing David Bornstein and Susan Davis (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Social-Entrepreneurship-What-Everyone-Needs/dp/0195396332\" title=\"\">Social Entrepreneurship: What Everyone Needs to Know</a>); the public institutions should act like a gardener, and not as a builder.</p> <p>Sweden and neighbouring countries have played host to a number of relevant conferences in recent years, and this autumn will see the conference <a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/about-us/euclid-network-annual-conference-2012.html\" title=\"\">Bridging the Gap \u2013 New Survival Strategies</a> be held in Malmo and Copenhagen. Scheduled for the 24-25 September, the concept compares the slow, dependent cow with the adaptable, independent squirrel. Through this metaphor, it is argued that the most effective social innovations are cultivated by self-organised, independent and adaptable social entrepreneurs. This is an important focus for the Europe of today, affected by financial crises, demographic changes, challenges with public health, migration and climate changes.</p> <p><em>Dr Sophia L\u00f6vgren is a board member at both the </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/\" title=\"\"><em>Euclid Network</em></a><em> and the </em><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"><em>Ideell Arena</em></a><em> and is secretary general of </em><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/about-us/euclid-network-annual-conference-2012.html\" title=\"\"><em>Remarkable Parents in Sweden</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.euclidnetwork.eu/about-us/euclid-network-annual-conference-2012.html\" title=\"\"><em>Bridging the Gap \u2013 New Survival Strategies</em></a><em>, organised by Euclid Network and its local partners Social+ and KPH Projects alongside the Forum for Social Innovation Sweden,, will take place from the 24th \u2014 25th September 2012.

  "<p>One story has dominated South African television news and it isn't politics or crime. It is the death of a stranded hippo.</p> <p>The demise of \"Solly\" in a swimming pool took up the first five minutes of bulletins on eNews Channel Africa, pushing the aftermath of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/south-africa-remembers-shot-miners\" title=\"\">Marikana mine massacre</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/breivik-verdict-sane-21-years\" title=\"\">sentencing of Norwegian murderer Anders Breivik</a> down the agenda.</p> <p>The young male hippo <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/hippo-stuck-in-swimming-pool\" title=\"\">had wandered into a swimming pool at a game reserve</a> three days earlier and died, reportedly from stress, just as he was about to be rescued with a crane.</p> <p>Wildlife rescue expert Simon Prinsloo had been pouring water on the animal with a bucket and then through a hose to keep it hydrated. The team were waiting for a vet to come before hoisting out the hippo but it succumbed as the vet arrived.</p> <p>The four-year-old hippo \u2013 named Solly by one of its caregivers \u2013 had plunged into the 2.4-metre-deep pool on Tuesday after being chased away from his herd by male members seeking dominance.</p> <p>His plight caught the attention of many in South Africa and made newspaper front pages. A Twitter account was launched on his behalf, using the handle @Modimollehippo and with the bio: \"I'm stranded in a swimming pool. Still... fame at last!\"</p> <p>Other tweets included: \"My feet are getting soooo wrinkly. #hippo\"; \"Okes I'm not going to lie. Could do with some fresh water in this pool. Getting a bit grim in here\"; \"This pool party sucks\" and \"What if freedom relegates me to nobody status?\"</p> <p>The swimming pool at the <a href=\"http://www.monatelodge.com\" title=\"\">Monate Conservation Lodge</a> near Modimolle, a small town north of Johannesburg, was big enough for the hippo to swim in and submerge himself but it had no steps and there was no way he could get out on his own. Rescuers drained most of the water from the pool in the rescue effort and a crane was positioned to hoist the one-tonne animal.</p> <p>Live TV pictures showed the hippo spout water in the pool. But the story, providing South Africans with light relief after bleak events in recent weeks, became grave when the hippo became inert and appeared lifeless.</p> <p>Ruby Ferreira, the lodge manager, <a href=\"http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/2012/08/24/solly-the-hippo-dies\" title=\"\">told the Times of South Africa</a>: \"Although we looked after him, it was an unnatural environment for him.

  "<p>This month <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/23/arctic-sea-ice-record-low\" title=\"\">we are expecting to see a record ice melt in the Arctic</a>. But this is not a world record we can celebrate. This is a wake-up call from planet Earth.</p> <p>Just 30 years ago, the Arctic Ocean ice cap covered an area roughly the size of Australia. Within a few decades, it will almost certainly disappear completely for the summer months. This will be the first time a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean has existed for many thousands of years. The Earth without the white area at the top of the world will look radically different from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise\" title=\"\">those first photographs we took of our home planet from space</a> just four decades ago. Those first pictures of the tiny, vulnerable, yet beautiful Earth led in part to the environmental movement. And now this movement has to dramatically change gear in response to what is happening.</p> <p>The Arctic is home to millions of people, including Inuit whose ancestors first settled thousands of years ago. It is also a unique ecosystem, home to some of the most extraordinary species on Earth, from the narwhal to the walrus to the polar bear. For hundreds of other migratory species, including humpback whales and Canada geese, it is a vital summer feeding ground.</p> <p>The amazing Arctic also plays a critical role in regulating our climate. The Arctic sea ice is like a giant mirror that reflects much of the sun's energy, helping to keep our planet cool. The formation of Arctic sea ice produces dense salt water which sinks, helping drive the deep ocean currents. Without the ice, this delicate balance will be upset and could cause profound regional and global climatic changes.</p> <p>We all rely on the Arctic for our survival. And now we are in danger of losing one of the world's great ecosystems and an important life support system leaving all species facing an increasingly insecure and uncertain future.</p> <p>But paradoxically, right now, no species will profit from it as much as the one causing it: humans.</p> <p>Oil companies do not like to talk about this. But at this moment, energy companies like Shell are preparing to invade areas of the Arctic Ocean that were once protected by the ice. They're desperate to claim the oil that lies beneath the seabed, so they can make more money, by burning more fuel, and melting more ice. It's a vicious circle driven by greed.</p> <p>But we know that, sooner or later, we are going to have to move on to some other source of energy that isn't oil. This is inevitable.</p> <p>The oil that flows from beneath the Arctic Ocean is destined to run out. It only holds three years' worth of global supply. If there was an oil spill, similar to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/22/oil-spill-arctic-analysis\" title=\"\">Exxon Valdez</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2010/jul/08/bp-oil-spill-timeline-interactive\" title=\"\">Deepwater Horizon</a>, it could be catastrophic for Arctic marine life.</p> <p>We should now declare the destruction of such a unique place as an act of vandalism on an unprecedented scale and take action to stop it. And we must also invest in new, greener sources of energy and energy efficiency.</p> <p>There must be a global sanctuary declared in the High Arctic and the Arctic Ocean made off limits to the oil industry and unsustainable, high impact, industrial fishing. We have developed a plan that can make this a reality if millions of people join us.</p> <p>This is perhaps the environment movement's biggest challenge ever. But we've done it before. Just over 20 years ago, Antarctica was at risk from industrialisation and militarisation. Greenpeace led the campaign to protect it. We won that campaign.</p> <p>And now we're determined to save the Arctic. We know this is a different fight, at a different time; not least because the Arctic is home to millions of people who have a critical say in the future of their region; and because the threat is not just from industrial development, but from the global crisis of climate change. But one critical factor remains the same: the united voice of millions of ordinary citizens can still be an irresistible agent of political change.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.savethearctic.org/\" title=\"\">a hugely ambitious campaign</a>. That's why we need people and organisations around the world to help save the Arctic. Everyone has to grab this historic moment and reclaim the earth that belongs to us all.</p>",
  "<p>A former Conservative treasurer has said that the party has a \"moral duty\" to return the \u00a3440,000 it received from Asil Nadir's Polly Peck company in the 1980s.</p> <p>After Nadir received a 10-year jail sentence on Thursday for stealing almost \u00a329m from the company he built up to be a global player, Lord McAlpine said the donation was \"tainted\" and had to be returned.</p> <p>McAlpine, who was Conservative party treasurer from 1975 to 1990,<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2192838/Polly-Peck-Keeping-tainted-money-corrupt-tycoon-shames-Tories-says-ex-Treasurer.html\" title=\"\"> told the Daily Mail </a>that when Polly Peck first donated to the party, Nadir was \"a dashing figure who was admired across Europe for his business flair\".</p> <p>\"But frankly the moment [Nadir] fled the country in 1993, to avoid criminal charges, it was obvious to me he was a complete conman. Frankly, the Tories should have given the money back in 1993.</p> <p>\"Today the case is even clearer. There is a moral imperative for the money to be returned. The money was not Asil Nadir's to give although we thought it was at the time.</p> <p>\"Therefore the Tory party has a duty to return it. It will speak volumes about the character of the modern Tory party if they don't do the right thing. I trust that David Cameron is an honourable man.\"</p> <p>McAlpine, who left the Conservatives before the 1997 election to campaign for the Referendum party before later rejoining the Tories, also said Lady Thatcher would have wanted the money returned.</p> <p>\"If Margaret Thatcher was still leader of the party I am absolutely certain she would have ordered the party to repay the lot. I can hear her barking down the phone: 'Alistair, we can't keep that man's money',\" he said.</p> <p>But on Friday, the Conservatives rejected McAlpine's call for the money to be returned. \"The Conservative party has no record of having received donations from Asil Nadir,\" a spokesman said. \"Donations were received from Polly Peck companies more than 22 years ago; these were accepted in good faith from what was then considered to be a leading British company.</p> <p>\"We have seen no evidence that money donated to the Conservative party from the Polly Peck group was stolen. But we have consistently said, as Norman Fowler, then party chairman, did in 1993, 'obviously if it is proved that that money was stolen it will be returned'.\"</p> <p>The Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who also wants the Tories to return the money, has written to the party highlighting newspaper reports saying that Touche Ross, the Polly Peck administrators, warned the party in 1993 that \u00a3365,000 of the \u00a3440,000 it received came from money defrauded from the Polly Peck empire.</p> <p>But a party spokesman said it was not aware of the Touche Ross report. He also questioned whether it ever existed.</p>",

  "<p>If European companies were fully engaged in boosting energy productivity, the continent as a whole could hold energy demand at 2008 levels, <a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/natural_resources/capturing_european_energy_productivity\" title=\"\">according to McKinsey &amp; Company</a>. Most increases in energy efficiency within industry are achieved through the installation of new technologies rather than through changes in how energy is managed. However, these installations are only achieving a fraction of what innovation in energy reduction could.</p> <p>There are many views as to why the industry is yet to become efficient in consuming energy. Some blame it on energy market and policy failures to expedite the diffusion of new technology. Others blame the short return on investment (ROI) in low cost energy and poor energy awareness.</p> <p>Do people matter in terms of improving and sustaining energy reduction? <a href=\"http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/What_countries_can_do_about_cutting_carbon_emissions_2128\" title=\"\">Another piece of research by McKinsey</a> suggests that up to 25% of energy consumption can be saved with little or no cost and without significant changes in lifestyle and business practices.</p> <h2>Applying technology alone is not sustainable</h2> <p>Energy is a largely invisible commodity. Many people turn on the light in their office without thinking about the energy this uses. Coupled with a lack of competency to identify energy inefficiencies and know-how in implementing solutions, management of energy becomes badly planned.</p> <p>Most companies delegate energy reduction to one or two people. Junior employees and external consultants have little influence over established ways of working and the power plays between managers.</p> <p>A significant number end up choosing to add energy efficient technology without consideration of the overall impact on daily operations and organisational culture. These measures are barriers to long term and sustainable energy management because they focus on fast results by implementing technology and removing human interventions.</p> <p>A disconnect between management and employees encourages a culture where good will and trust are lacking. This can alienate employee involvement, lead to a breakdown in communications and mean that technical knowledge begins to reside with individuals rather than in the organisation.</p> <p>The reasons for this disconnect range from fear of unknown outcomes, to fear of changing focus towards energy reduction and the impact on a manager's social standing within the organisation, right down to the human instinct for immediate gratification and a tendency for putting off work that should be done today.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.iso.org/sites/iso50001launch/assets/docs/04-Marco_Matteini-why_ISO_50001_dev_countries.pdf\" title=\"\">Reconnecting people to energy reduction</a></h2> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/hr-resources/survey-reports/employee-outlook-winter-2011-12.aspx\" title=\"\">recent survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD)</a> found that 60% of employees are neither engaged nor disengaged with company initiatives. In order to consume energy efficiently and effectively, management needs to find ways to motivate and mobilise this dormant resource. At its core, active and sustainable energy management requires a large group of people to be interested in energy reduction, embrace change and then sustain it.</p> <p>The majority of low cost opportunities involve turning things off and turning things down. Even a simple change in office temperature from 24\u00b0C to 21\u00b0C can be met by a significant level of resistance within an organisation.

This is especially true when a proposed change involves production, maintenance, quality and human comfort.</p> <p>\u2022 Set clear, stretched and realistic targets for change to focus employees' mind set and interest and ensure they begin to focus on achieving the objectives and tasks.</p> <p>\u2022 Use clear, concise and unchanging use of terminologies. Terminology that is simple and understandable builds trust.</p> <p>\u2022 Lead by visible and audible example.</p> <p>\u2022 Provide opportunities for employees to contribute and take action in their daily work.</p> <p>\u2022 Ensure that actions are meaningful through the use of simple indicators.</p> <p>\u2022 Provide a continual stream of communication and encouragement.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iso.org/sites/iso50001launch/assets/docs/04-Marco_Matteini-why_ISO_50001_dev_countries.pdf\" title=\"\">Using a good management system, such as ISO 50001</a>, alongside emotional intelligence promotes an environment that removes organisational resistance and develops and reinforces the values necessary for long term energy reduction.</p> <p>Companies new to energy reduction can expect energy savings of up to 20% within the first two years.

  "<p>Ah, the summer of 2012: it will forever bring back teary-eyed memories of the wrong kind. It was a time when good old German Fu\u00dfball was supposed to make a splash in the big pond again but saw its post-season challenges peter out like a leaky paddling pool instead. First Bayern Munich were transfixed in horror as their self-assured \"<em>mia san mia</em>\" (we are who we are) motto gave way to \"mia san meek\" at the penalty spot. Jupp Heynckes' side somehow concocted to lose the Champions League trophy on their home ground to a befuddled middle-aged man in a cardigan and an over-eager spectator who evaded security in full match-day apparel. Work that one out, android David.</p> <p>Not to be outdone, the national manager Jogi L\u00f6w then made matters much worse in Germany's Euro 2012 semi-final against Italy by overaccommodating the opposition with the narrowest of midfields. It was, without a doubt, the biggest lineup screw-up since special agent Dave Kujan let Verbal Kint hobble off.</p> <p>If those two giant mishaps served one good purpose it was to reinforce the lust for the Bundesliga, a world of wonder successfully isolated from decades of international underachievement. The German football lover is a fiercely loyal, upstanding creature of simple taste. Not for him the wallet-busting dreams of exotic, racy conquests on European nights; domestic, dependable action is where it's at. That sense of contentment at home is, as usual, reflected in the ever-growing number of season ticket sales. 428,495 jahreskarten were sold by the end of this week in the top flight, and that figure is artificially kept low by capped allocations, in an effort to keep seats available for casual fans. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, finally back in the Bundesliga after dropping all the way down to the fourth division after relegation in 1997, have managed to flog 31,000 season tickets \u2013 an impressive fourth in the table behind Borussia Dortmund (54,000), Schalke (43,195) and Bayern (38,000). Those three and nine further clubs have sold out their available season tickets contingents.</p> <p>After last season's double, Dortmund's emergence as a bona-fide heavyweight has undoubtedly enhanced the appeal of the league's 50th instalment. For the first time since the Black-Yellow's heyday in the mid-90s, they have been name-checked as title favourites alongside Bayern by the 18 Bundesliga coaches, a constituency that reliably voted Bavarian by huge margins in seasons gone by. So can Borussia, who start their title defence against Werder Bremen on Friday night, make it the first non-red and white hat-trick since Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 35 years ago?</p> <p>On paper, the champions look just as tasty as before. Despite much real and much more made-up interest in their star players, they managed to keep all their important names apart from Shinji Kagawa. And in Marco Reus, the German Player of the Year, they've signed an even better man in the hole as the Japanese's replacement. Officially, a Champions League finish is the modest target but the manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said that his side's hunger for success is undiminished. \"The team are fortunate to have me, because I can never get enough,\" stated the 45-year-old. It'll be interesting to find out if the coach can at last adapt his side's ultra-energetic pressure game to the European stage. Better performances are mandatory after last season's embarrassing Champions League exit.</p> <p>Werder, their opponents in the Signal Iduna Park, have more humble concerns. The sporting director Klaus Allofs and the coach Thomas Schaaf have set out to rebuild the squad after two seasons without international football. The Nigerian striker Jonathan Akpala has joined from FC Br\u00fcgge along with Kevin de Bruyne, the on-loan winger from Chelsea, Juventus's Dutch enigma Eljero Elia and Nils Petersen from Bayern, also on loan. \"I'm keen to see whether we'll have enough to get a result,\" said Schaaf after an encouraging pre-season that was somewhat marred by a DFB Cup defeat at the hands of third division Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster last weekend. The supporters are also unhappy with the new shirt-sponsor Wiesenhof. It's a chicken company with a decidedly mixed record \u2013 and naturally the starting point of 1,000 poultry-based puns over the course of the campaign.</p> <p>Schalke, who finished third last season, have more realistic ambitions to rule the roost and are widely seen as the most likely side to challenge Bayern and Dortmund. The Royal Blues still have the league's best striker in Klaas-Jan Huntelaar as well as good depth in the squad following the acquisition of the Swiss winger Tranquilo Barnetta from Bayer Leverkusen and the midfielder Roman Neust\u00e4dter from Gladbach. Wolfsburg, prolific in the transfer market as is Felix Magath's wont, have aspirations for a top-four-finish, too.</p> <p>Bayern, meanwhile, have added yet another outspoken big ego to their board: self-styled \"firehead\" Matthias Sammer has joined as sporting director in place of the quiet Christian Nerlinger. It's an interesting set-up with far-reaching implications for the struggle for control behind the scenes and for Heynckes' standing at the club. But so far, it seems to work. After the arrival of Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri, Brazilian defender Dant\u00e9 from (Gladbach and the two strikers Claudio Pizarro from Werder and Mario Mandzukic from Wolfsburg, there are much-needed alternatives in the squad.</p> <p>The Athletic Bilbao midfielder Javi Mart\u00ednez might yet join for \u20ac40m but the transfer is being hampered by the intricacies of Spanish tax law and the immovability of Athletic's president Josu Urrutia. \"We will fight until the last day for the player,\" said Bayern's executive chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Last year's runners-up in all competitions will start the season away to newly promoted Greuther F\u00fcrth who host matches in the deliciously-named Trolli ARENA. True fact: the ground used to be called Playmobil Stadion before, back when it could be quickly re-configured into a pirate ship, knight's castle or lunar station. (That last bit is not actually true, sadly).</p> <p>For Gladbach, meanwhile, the new beginning also marks the end, unfortunately: their Champions League dreams are all but over after crashing to a 3-1 defeat at home in the first leg of their qualifier against Dynamo Kiev. Lucien Favre seemed to blame new striker Luuk de Jong, a \u20ac15m addition from FC Twente, for the defeat, or perhaps the sporting director Max Eberl: \"Our forwards are too similar,\" scoffed the Swiss coach. A finish in the top half of the table is the Foals' very modest aim but maybe the luck of Lucien will return in the Europa League? Some international pulling power really wouldn't hurt the league's efforts to wrestle with Serie A and La Liga for second billing on global TV schedules, even if most German supporters, punch-drunk on what is still the world's most fan-friendly competition, really couldn't care less.</p>",
  "<p>A granite pink-footed goose egg glinting on lava rock is what you first encounter when entering the timely George Wyllie exhibition in the garden of the Scottish parliament. How Wyllie would have smiled. </p> <p>He was all for the birds, especially since the promise of Sigurdur Gudmundson's sculpture celebrates one which winters in Scotland but summers in Iceland. </p> <p>One of his most famous scul?tures (with the Wyllie question mark firmly in the centre) was that absurd Berlin Burd, keeking over that far absurder Berlin Wall. The original burd is still there, alongside a fragment of what the German Democratic Republic called its anti-fascist protection rampart, though a fledgling version now stands guarding the parliament's garden ramparts.</p> <p>This <a href=\" http://www.whysman.co.uk/scottish-parliament-exhibition.html\">timely exhibition</a> was initiated by Joan McAlpine MSP, on a suggestion from the artist's daughter Louise and the journalist Jan Patience. I was backed into the limelight to chair the accompanying <a href=\"http://www.festivalofpolitics.org.uk/37.htm\">Festival of Politics</a>, Art in Focus event at the Parliament. </p> <p>This was a real pleasure because George, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/may/22/george-wyllie\">died this year</a> at 90, was a great artist and a close friend. My late wife Barbara, who for years chaired the Scottish Sculpture Trust, was a champion of George's work and produced A Day Down a Goldmine with Bill Paterson. </p> <p>This surrealist play on the falsehoods of monetarism is remembered now as an eerie forecast on the vanity and greed of bankers. In equal draughts of pleasure and exasperation Bill convulsed the parliament audience in laughter as he recalled his time down that goldmine. </p> <p>Although admiring George's unrelenting quizzing, his barrage of astute comments and his continual challenging of theatrical norms, it was his heavy metal props hurled across the stage that kept him on his toes. </p> <p>David Harding, who founded the <a href=\"http://www.gsa.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-degrees/sculpture-environmental-art/\">environmental art course</a> at the Glasgow School of Art explained the effect George had when he was invited to address his first year students. They included Douglas Gordon, Christine Borland, Roddy Buchanan and many others, who have since made their international reputations as conceptual artists. George taught the students how to think big, said Roddy Buchanan.</p> <blockquote> <p>It was George who fired our imaginations; for him public art is an art that public can't fail to notice.</p> </blockquote> <p>In turn George's inspiration came from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/beuys\">Joseph Beuys</a> \u2013 the cultural commando who landed with his Dusseldorf platoon of artists at the invitation of Richard Demarco for the 1970 Edinburgh Festival. <a href=\"http://www.richarddemarco.org/documents/strategy_get_arts.html\">Strategy Get Arts</a>, with its catchy palindromic title, made an overwhelming impression on George, although the Art Establishment only realized its significance years later. </p> <p>In the following years George worked with Beuys on the dismantling of the broken doors of the Edinburgh Poor House which are now in the M\u00f6nchengladbach Museum in Germany. Above all Beuys inspired George to think of the environment. His series of hand-made spires, slender tripods pivoting their counter weighted central arms in the landscape, would be a homage to Beuys, who spoke of the urgent need for balance in our relationship with nature.</p> <p>In 1992 George inveigled me into filming a tiny part of his ambitious project called 32 Spires for Hibernia, his contribution to the unification of Ireland. When we met in Galway he had been to every one of Ireland's 32 counties, both south and north, gathering appropriately shaped branches and stones. </p> <p>When the set was complete George linked the spires to straddle a Border stream near a concrete roadblock on an unauthorized road outside Derry. </p> <p>Their spindly branches nodded on their gimbals in the wind like a Flintstones' radar combing the sky for invaders. Soon a helicopter was fluttering overhead. Within weeks that roadblock, which had lasted for almost 70 years, crumbled \u2013 just like the Berlin Wall. Ars Omnia Vincit.</p> <p>When Barbara Grigor invited George Rickey, the west of Scotland-educated American artist, to mount his kinetic sculptures along Glasgow's Broomielaw in 1982, she introduced the two Georges to each other. This enabled the master of Gourock to create work at the Rickey Foundation in East Chattam, New York State. </p> <p>The nearby Shaker Museum inspired him to create a series of wry sculptures in homage to their pared-down designs. Tom Freudenheim, the American art writer, still delights in his economical Wyllie Shaker stove, a metal clamp around a single log with a spindly chimney meandering above. It warms his heart, if not his hearth.</p> <p>After Liz Lochhead read her wry and witty poem 'A Wee Multitude of Questions for George Wyllie' last Friday it triggered quite a heated debate why the work of George Wyllie wasn't celebrated in the national collections. </p> <p>Lochhead's poem illuminates Wyllie's work and life by asking a series of questions, and most particularly this: </p> <blockquote> <p>Who is the man <br>whose name belies his nature?<br>(for 'wily' he is not; there is <br>craft in it, and art, but no guile. He is true<br>and straight, his strategy is honesty, and to ask --<br>in all innocence<br>in all experience --<br>the simplest, starkest, startling<br>questions.)</p> <p>Who makes biting satire out of mild steel?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/consultants.html\">Tom Freudenheim</a> was appalled that a recent BBC programme on the Glasgow Conceptualists failed to mention George's influence. To help spread the word from the USA, where Tom has compared the meaningless $35 million steam engine proposed by Jeff Koons with George's Straw Loco, he is willing to donate a Wyllie scul?ture to Scotland.</p>",

Twitter and LinkedIn are still great channels for B2B relationships, but my first starting point would be to look at the audience you are trying to attract and find out where they are online, and engage with them there.</p> <p>\"Likes\" on Facebook are a great indication of appeal, but really you want to turn those likers into ambassadors for you, and really engage with them. Find out quickly if they are the kind of people who will buy your product. There are many ways of doing this, like running competitions and encouraging them to share your page for a discount.</p> <p>Make sure you are proactively following the right people. This needs to be defined in advance as part of your audience definition in your wider strategy, but it will be specific for the social channel. You will need a slightly different approach for each channel on social media. A handy content strategy is something like 20% inform, 20% entertain, 40% engage and 20% convert to business. The more you have pre-planned, the better in terms of frequency of posting on Twitter, blogs, LinkedIn and discussion groups. What content will reflect your key messages and proposition, and so on?</p> <p><em>Andy Lopata is an expert on </em><a href=\"http://www.lopata.co.uk/blog/and-death-came-third\" title=\"\"><em>networking strategy</em></a></p> <p><strong>Networking online? Remember to develop trust before leaping in:</strong> Social networks are built on two-way and engaged communication, and broadcasting is frowned upon. You need to develop trust first. Have a strategy that encompasses all social networking sites, as well as your face-to-face networking activity, so that everything you do works together. Focus on just a few social networks initially and understand what they will help you achieve, whether it is raising your profile, market research or finding intermediaries, for example. Guide your activity based on the desired outcome.</p> <p><strong>Remember to engage:</strong> I would look to join groups on sites like LinkedIn where your potential clients may congregate and then be proactive about posting and commenting in discussions to raise your profile. You can do the same using the appropriate Twitter hashtags. The golden rule when you do so is to engage and not sell; demonstrate your expertise with intelligent questions and responses, rather than pitching your services. You want to draw people towards you.</p> <p><strong>Enjoy networking \u2013 it's not a burden:</strong> Don't see sales and networking as a burden. Remind yourself that people will benefit from what you can offer them. As a result of your work they will see their businesses grow, raise the profile of key products or find it much easier to communicate a key message to their stakeholders. You're not begging them for money, you're making their life easier. You'll be doing them a disservice if you don't give them the opportunity to work with you. Many people hate networking because they feel under pressure to sell to a room full of people who aren't interested in buying. No wonder it affects our confidence! So stop selling and start having fun and finding like minded people.</p> <p><em>Emma Jones is founder of small business community </em><a href=\"http://www.enterprisenation.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Enterprise Nation</em></a></p> <p><strong>Selling is key to winning new business:</strong> A couple of options for increasing sales include going global and selling to millions of customers overseas who have a thirst for British goods, or setting up a pop-up shop or stall which will deliver benefits to your small business in the form of new and offline sales.</p> <p><strong>Don't try to do too much:</strong> Focus on what you do best and outsource the rest.

  "<p>If Prince Charles is half as cross as reported about his younger son's latest scrape, he will do well to ponder that his own conduct has provided the tabloids with plenty to gossip about over the years, as have royal princes down the ages. In that respect they are not so different from other testosterone-fuelled young men, merely of greater interest to censorious monkish chroniclers, clucking courtiers and paparazzi, nowadays to YouTube addicts too.</p> <p>When royals ruled as well as reigned before 1689, sexual and financial scandal could easily shake the state to its foundations, whereas today only the monarchy itself is put at risk. Edward II and his male favourites were deposed and murdered by his wife, Isabella, and her lover in 1327, only to be deposed themselves by Edward III as soon as he was old enough (18).</p> <p>Edward IV, Henry VIII, James I \u2013 their rackety private lives and personal conduct cast shadows over their public reputations, then and since. As for Charles II's (reigned 1660-1685) fabled love life, lacking nothing except a legitimate heir, it far outstripped the imagination of Sun readers and gave rise to one of the best one-liners in the genre. When in 1681 her coach was attacked in mistake for that of her Catholic rival, the spirited Nell Gwyn \u2013 a born Page 3 girl \u2013 put her head out of the window and cried: \"Good people, you are mistaken. I am the <em>Protestant</em> whore.\" The heirs to Nell's bastard children by the king are still Dukes of St Albans.</p> <p>So there is nothing new, except that it is now all rather tamer. In June 1963, the future Prince of Wales was a 14-year-old Gordonstoun schoolboy when, cornered by a crowd in Stornoway, he dived into a public bar to escape and ordered the first drink he could think of. Only the previous year the tabloids had promised to respect Buckingham Palace's plea for the royal adolescent's privacy. But the \"cherry brandy incident\" proved impossible to resist. With rare pre-Leveson exceptions such incidents usually did.</p> <p>Thirty years later Charles was caught in a grainy long lens shot, standing with only a towel draped over his shoulder at a window in the Chateau Barroux near Avignon. The European press \u2013 but not Britain's \u2013 had a field day: \"Hunky like a Greek statue,\" said the man from Bild, the German tabloid. \"You English can be proud of him,\" purred Paris Match while Buck House protested in vain at intrusion.</p> <p>By that stage Charles was 45, had separated from his first wife, Diana, and suffered the acute humiliation in having toe-curling sweet-talk with his mistress, Camilla Parker-Bowles (now his second wife), intercepted (by whom?) and published alongside the audio tape. Prince and princess slugged out their betrayals and disappointments in rival TV interviews. Three years later, ever more brazen paparazzi with their global market to feed chased Diana to her death in Paris.</p> <p>It was the Windsors' strong desire to protect the young princes \u2013 representing as they did the future of \"the firm\" \u2013 which led to pressure on the police to prosecute the News of the World's royal reporter, Clive Goodman, and his hacker, Glenn Mulcaire, rather than ignore such activity as they hoped to do for hundreds of non-royal hacking victims. The Leveson inquiry is currently passing judgment on that cover-up, with potentially incalculable consequences for publication of the kind of \"Naked Harry\" shots now on the internet.</p> <p>Licentious royal behaviour prompting a hostile public reaction and a censorious press is a recurring pattern. When the press overdoes it \u2013 as in the years since the Charles and Diana rift \u2013 public sympathy swings back the other way. The pattern was most evident in the 19th century. After the seven surviving sons of the uxorious George III (king between 1760-1820) disgraced themselves in all ways imaginable, the only legitimate child they managed to produce between them, Queen Victoria (1837-1901), turned the royal family into the epitome of high-minded respectability.</p> <p>Much like Prince Charles, her eldest son, Bertie, the future Edward VII, spent most of his life waiting for the job, like Charles a moderniser with some progressive views. Much more than Charles he turned his back on Victorian respectability: a womaniser from his youth, his high-living mixed up in gambling scandals, country sports and racing, his sex life was kept out of the press (as was his ill-health), though it was touch and go.</p> <p>When he finally became King (1901-10), his waist measured 48 inches and had a coronation box set aside for a clutch of mistresses. A Paris brothel boasted a <em>si\u00e8ge d'amour,</em> a love chair that allowed the portly prince to be serviced by two women at once. Voters knew nothing of this and when his second son succeeded as George V (his elder brother, the Duke of Clarence, had died in 1892 surrounded by sexual gossip and alleged imbecility, linked wrongly with the Jack the Ripper murders) the palace reverted again to dull respectability.</p> <p>By the time the new heir to the throne, the future Edward VIII, later Duke of Windsor, started going off the rails, the modern media existed in recognisable form, not least free market radio across the US. Edward's fatal dalliance with the twice-divorced American, Wallace Simpson, was widely reported there, but hushed up by the Fleet Street press lords until a bishop broke the silence, triggering the crisis that swept the new king away in 1936.</p> <p>Ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth grew up in the shadow of that crisis, her mother blamed Edward for the strains of wartime kingship that (along with heavy smoking) helped push her husband, George VI, to an early grave in 1952. Even without her own sister Princess Margaret's exotic love life and her children's divorces, Elizabeth II may not relish Prince Harry's high jinks in Las Vegas. But she has seen a lot worse.</p>",

Photograph: Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In other words is our character determined by our genes, or by our environment? Many efforts have been made to resolve this most fundamental question. Notable among these was the 1923 Nature versus Nurture football match on Tooting Common, London. The Nature team took an early lead with their instinctive ball skills, but by the second half the superior training and fitness of the Nurture team looked likely to produce an equaliser when HG Wells ran onto the pitch and bit the referee and the match was abandoned. By 1975 methods were more sophisticated when Professor Batsen D Belfroi took 10 infant laboratory rats and swapped them with ten human babies. The babies were kept in warm and comfortable laboratory conditions with regular water and exercise and all the nuts and seeds they could fit in their cheeks while the rats were brought up by pushy middle class human families who then used their contacts to get them jobs in management. The rats went on to work with some success for a variety of high-profile firms including Lehmann Brothers, News International and Barclays but in the end they resigned in disgust at the corporate culture. The babies grew up to start a lucrative muesli and rope-gnawing business. Asked what induced him to undertake such a grotesque experiment Belfroi said \u2013 \"I blame society. Or else I guess that's just what I'm like.\"</p> <h2>Why don't I like rocket? I like all the other salad leaves.</h2> <p>One of the nice things about lettuce is that it contains taraxasterol, while watercress is brilliant because it is rich in phytochemicals. I'm afraid there isn't any comparable data to account for your aversion. That's the problem with the bio-chemical analysis of salad. It's not rocket science.</p> <h2>What came first: orange the fruit, or orange the colour?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395114993\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345742535030/1723614-008.jpg\" alt=\"1723614\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">...What?

Both are named after the great niece of William III, Princess Majdin-Tjaalsee of Orange (1702-1768). Majdin-Tjaalsee established a fashion in court for bronzed skin tones, but as these were hard to come by in her native Holland she regularly had her skin sprayed with a mixture of glue and turmeric, giving her the distinctive reddy-yellow hue we know today as \"orange\". As the Princess of Orange aged she banqueted enthusiastically and became rotund and somewhat plagued with cellulite, prompting a court wag to quip that \"she looks just like those lemony-grapefruity things we don't have a name for yet.\" The rest is history.</p> <h2>Where did you get that hat?

I found it next to a ruined farm building I came across on a rambling holiday in Shropshire. On a whim I picked it up and hurled it into the midst of a gloomy thicket.&#xa0;As for the hat, I made it myself by simply hollowing-out a squashed owl that I found underneath a heavy terracotta tile in the midst of a gloomy thicket.</p> <h2>When will people realise that there are enough TV programmes already and try to get through them all before they make any new ones?</h2> <p>In 1945 the world's top scientists, finding themselves with a lot less in their in-trays all of a sudden, formed a secret committee to consider future threats to peace and happiness. Their conclusions made terrifying reading for the governments of the world, for they pointed to a possible danger from the stars. Since we began using radio waves to communicate, they reasoned, we have been announcing our presence in the galaxy to alien intelligences, effectively advertising ourselves as a glittering prize replete with cultural riches such as symphonies and learned discourses and stirring plays and speeches, just ripe for the taking. And so The Cleveland Project was launched: its aim, to encourage the brightest and best talents of every nation to devote their lives to creating millions and millions of hours of programming devoid of any cultural or intellectual value. Thus a shield of dross is pumped out into space deterring for ever any predatory species tempted to make our riches their own. Such television is not for watching.

The remaining headcount reductions will be primarily consultants in Sweden. Lund will continue to be an important strategic site for Sony Mobile, with the main focus on software and application development.</p> </blockquote> <p> The company headquarters are moving from Lund to Tokyo.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/the-incredibly-detailed-beautifully-illustrated-insanely-intricate-birth-of\">The incredibly detailed, beautifully illustrated, insanely intricate birth of a video game Mech &gt;&gt; Penny Arcade</a></h2> <p>It is indeed all those things.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattbuchanan/the-original-iphone-4-design-prototype-from-2006\">An old iPhone 4 design prototype from 2006 &gt;&gt; Buzzfeed</a></h2> <p>With a \"Sony\" logo, no less, for internal consumption.

Almost all of them are affiliated with Bain Capital, the secretive private equity firm Romney co-founded in 1984 and ran until his departure in 1999 (or 2002, depending on whom you ask).</p> </blockquote> <p> For clarity, we'd like to point out that the \"dodging\" here would be tax avoidance, not evasion.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://helenedwards.marketingmagazine.co.uk/2012/08/22/helen-edwards-tripadvisor-and-the-looming-decline-of-user-generated-content/\">Helen Edwards: TripAdvisor and the looming decline of user-generated content &gt;&gt; Marketing Blogs</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>The decline is yet to come - but here's what the scholars will tell: the flaws of the user-generated model were the inverse of its strengths, with the seeds of decline sown into the model itself.</p> <p> User-generated sites such as TripAdvisor eventually begin to sag under the weight of their own banality.
