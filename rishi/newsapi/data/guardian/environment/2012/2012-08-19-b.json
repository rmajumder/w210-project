  "<p>Fine writing, trenchant class analysis, a baby-doll robe scarcely concealing an enviably beach-ready body. But enough about me. There was so much to enjoy in <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/itvplayer/#intcmp=NAV_ITVPLAYE\" title=\"\"><strong>The Last Weekend</strong></a> (ITV1, Sunday) that it made one forget that its chief role may be to prepare us for the return to our screens later this week of one marvellous actor with a you've-got-to-be kidding posh name (Benedict Cumberbatch) by deploying another (Rupert Penry-Jones).</p> <p>I don't know if Blake Morrison's novel is any good, but if it's half as accomplished as Mick Ford's adaptation then last year's Booker prize winner must be stripped of the award. Ordinary herberts Ian and Em arrive in their joke motor for a weekend at Daisy and Ollie's twee Suffolk cottage. Ian and Daisy had a thing 20 years ago and it's Ian's fervent hope to get inside her aforementioned robe and reprise their romance. Yes, Ollie may be terminally ill, and, yes, Em is possibly ovulating and insistent that Ian impregnates her. Right. Now. But still, male desire for weekend adultery and the symbolic castration of one's soon-to-be posthumous love rival will not be gainsaid. At least not on ITV.</p> <p>Uni buddies Ollie and Ian have had a man-thing going on for two decades, whereby they do annual battle in a yawnable triathlon of golf, cycling and one other I've forgotten. It's a skirmish in the class war: Shaun Evans' Ian is a ratty scally hoodie on a primary schoolteacher's salary; Penry-Jones's Ollie is a blond god with proper golf shoes who looks improbably foxy in his barrister's wig. Throughout, the superbly eloquent eyebrows of Claire Keelan as Em function as Greek chorus, telling us the quartet are fate's playthings. Genevieve O'Reilly as Daisy is haughty and horny, like a young Lindsay Duncan \u2013 which, trust me younger readers, is high praise.</p> <p>Ford's writing is surely the best in TV drama since Steven Moffat's Sherlock. I quite liked his device of Ian stepping from a scene to comment on it, especially as Evans mutated during these sequences from prole-dupe to lairy sexpot with anger issues. Better, though, was how Ford teased us. Does Ollie (Penry-Jones) really have an inoperable brain tumour, or is he lying to trick Ian into a fatal misstep? \"I could murder someone. I've got no conscience. I'm evil,\" says this wannabe East Anglian Raskolnikov as his souped-up convertible barrels terrifyingly down country lanes and Ian cowers in the passenger seat.</p> <p>But what comes on like Crime and Punishment could readily become brained-up Midsomer Murders. Is this really Ollie's last weekend? Is Milo, the guy who arrives in a potboiler twist at the end of the first episode, going to upset everything like his namesake in CBeebies' <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies/tweenies/\" title=\"\">Tweenies</a>? I'm not sure where the story's going, but I'm enjoying the ride too much to need to know.</p> <p>When I was a child, the Dudley branch of the Jeffries family counted the times that George A Cooper as Billy Liar's dad said \"bloody\" in an episode. Sometimes it was more than 20. We were scandalised. I lost count, during <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-function-room\" title=\"\"><strong>The Function Room</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday), how many times the uniformly excellent cast said \"shit\", but it would have given the Jeffrieses conniptions.</p> <p>Admittedly, the police and residents meeting in a pub sought to crack the case of the so-called Shit-Egg Killer, a venal hurler of uncouth missiles through blameless suburban windows. They won't use that nickname in the press, counselled Kevin Eldon's weary-eyed copper. Yeah, no one puts shit in the papers, a sarky resident quipped. Not even the Daily Mail.</p> <p>Writer Dan Maier and the cast were enjoying themselves so much it was infectious. \"A phalanx of youths have been causing ructions in my cul-de-sac,\" complained an out-of-work camp thesp plummily, introducing a Crimewatch-meets-Mrs-Slocombe vibe. It's nice to see Simon Day playing another pub bore. He wasn't saying that talcum powder is made from human skulls, just noting that episodes of ethnic cleansing are followed by rises in global talc production. I'm not sure where Maier goes after this pilot, but I really want to find out. Commission a series, Channel 4!</p> <p>The title of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/im-spazticus\" title=\"\"><strong>I'm Spazticus</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday) filled me with as much dread as C4's grotesquely named Make Bradford British. In the event it was a jolly prank show with a twist. Think Fonejacker where prankers are amputees, blind, have cerebral palsy or \u2013 in my favourite sketch \u2013 one is a parachutist in a wheelchair, dangling inches from the ground after getting stuck in a tree. Who, after making small talk, could walk on and let him dangle? How could&#xa0;they not cut him down? He's probably still there, dead. This country.&#xa0;Honestly.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, a new report on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/english-defence-league?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">English Defence League</a> was released. Detailing the key personalities within the movement and their links to the global \"counter-jihad\" movement, the document sought to set out what \"really lies behind\" the group that attracts considerable attention but remains little understood. The author, however, was not a researcher, campaigner or thinktank. It was the chairman of the British National party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nick-griffin?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Nick Griffin</a>.</p> <p>Griffin's report marks the latest episode in an escalating story of tension between the BNP and EDL, which has so far been restricted to Twitter and the occasional slanging match at demonstrations. The report goes further, claiming that behind the EDL lie a number of shadowy neoconservatives and \"Zionist terrorists\" who are seeking to manipulate public concern over Islam to launch new wars and split the far right nationalist scene. It is classic conspiracy theory stuff, although it is no surprise that the co-leader of the EDL, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was unconvinced:&#xa0;\"I swear Nick Griffin's lost the plot,\" he announced on Twitter.</p> <p>Seen from one angle, the episode is merely the latest example in a long history of rivalry within the far right. The latest accusations are partly a response to anxieties within the BNP about being out-flanked by the EDL and its new alliance with British Freedom, which will see both groups increase their involvement in elections. This begins with elections for a police commissioner in Bedford in November, but may snowball into more significant campaigns at the 2013 local elections and 2014 European elections (where two BNP candidates, including Griffin, hope to save their seats).</p> <p>For the BNP, the significance of the challenge is underscored by a disastrous set of results at elections this year. At the London mayoral election, its candidate of Uruguayan heritage polled fewer than 29,000 first preference votes, finishing seventh and failing to match the party's result in 2000. Meanwhile, at the Greater London Assembly elections the number of BNP votes was lower than at any previous contest and at local elections the party stood fewer than 140 candidates and failed to win a single seat. With the party in electoral freefall, there is space for a new challenger.</p> <p>But the rivalry also reflects a broader process of fragmentation within the far right. The most striking aspect of this year's elections was the number of far right parties competing alongside the BNP. In England, local elections were contested by 149 candidates from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/far-right\" title=\"\">far right</a> groups other than the BNP, and in some areas these out-performed the 30-year-old party. In Dudley, for example, the BNP was forced to watch its old and more ideologically extreme rival, the National Front, attract more votes. This owes much to a series of personality clashes and ideological splits that have spawned an increasing number of groups, including Britain First, British Freedom, British People's party, England First, National Front, English Democrats, Democratic Nationalists and the Britannica party. Most lack resources and members, but their emergence reflects a scene that is in transition and has not yet decided on its destination.</p> <p>More broadly, the BNP-EDL rivalry also reflects how the failure of the far right has often owed more to internal disunity than a lack of external space. The latest spat follows a long line of disputes between the BNP and the National Front in the 1980s, the BNP and Combat 18 in the 1990s, and Griffin and his internal critics in the 2000s. But in Britain, as elsewhere, there has emerged a perfect storm for the far right: ongoing public concern over immigration, more specific anxiety over Islam, falling trust in political institutions, weakening bonds between voters and mainstream parties and the financial crisis have each offered opportunities.</p> <p>The picture is not all bad, as the young are generally more tolerant than older generations. But there clearly remains ample potential for a far right populist challenger. Whether this latest round of internecine rivalry will remain confined to elections remains to be seen. What is clear is that \u2013 one way or another \u2013 the modern face of far right politics in Britain looks set to have a makeover.</p> <p>\u2022 This article will be opened to comments on Monday morning</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Pietersen, playing his first match since being dropped by England a week ago, was bowled for a golden duck on Sunday as he found The Rose Bowl a land fit for anti-heroes.</p> <p>The player, who is expected to meet Andrew Strauss on Wednesday following allegations that he texted South African opponents with advice on how to dismiss the England captain, was playing for Surrey against Hampshire in his first CB40 game of the season. He was jeered and booed to the crease when he went in first wicket down, after opener Rory Hamilton-Brown had been dismissed in the fifth over.</p> <p>He was out first ball, bowled by Liam Dawson as he pushed forward defensively \u2013 the second time he has been dismissed by this left-arm spinner for a golden duck this summer. It is left-arm spin, along with his mobile phone, which has been perceived as Pietersen's biggest technical weakness in recent times.</p> <p>When he returned to the pavilion, one minute after he had left it, there was little of the polite applause which could just be heard amid the rude cacophony that marked his arrival.</p> <p>Now the jeering rose in a fresh crescendo, for there has always been an antipathy towards the player in these parts since he left the county in 2010.</p> <p>As a Hampshire player he was spotted about as frequently as the Asian snow leopard and made only one championship appearance for the county in the five years from 2006 to 2010, when he joined Surrey on loan. On leaving Hampshire he cited the difficulties in travelling to Southampton from his London home.</p> <p>For Surrey he scored a championship double century against Lancashire at Guildford earlier in the season but in the 16 matches he has played for the county in all cricket, his side has won twice.</p> <p>Hampshire won this match by four wickets to stay on top of Group B. Pietersen will have the chance to improve his record on Tuesday, when he is expected to play for Surrey against Glamorgan.</p> <p>But it is Pietersen's future as an England player that is the game's biggest talking point and it is in considerable doubt following his texts to the South Africa dressing room, in which he also allegedly referred to Strauss as a \"doos\", which is \"box\" in Afrikaans or \"cunt\" in common parlance.</p> <p>\"If what is being written is correct, he's absolute history and there's no way he'll ever play again,\" said Tony Greig on Sunday, another former England captain who was born in South Africa. \"He had character problems back in South Africa, he's not an easy bloke in any team environment, he's not turned out to be a great team man and it's now got even worse.\"</p> <p>Greig, who knows what it feels like to be intensely unpopular with English cricket \u2013 in his case it was the role he played in the Kerry Packer revolution of 1977, while still England captain, that made him such a pariah \u2013 added: \"There's been a fair bit building up for a while and you can't be captain of a team and have this sort of thing happening on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>\"You can put the odd fire out but how many times can people say sorry? It has now gone beyond that, you can't put up with it. This thing seems to be getting worse and worse by the day.\"</p> <p>Greig's words were echoed by the former ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin, who said: \"If the reports in the papers are true, I think Mr Pietersen will never play for England again. Nobody is bigger than the game and history is littered with sports stars who believe they are bigger than the game, and business people too. They usually end up halfway down the batting order. If you look at the record of the gentleman concerned, he hasn't been greatly loved at Hampshire, at Nottinghamshire or at Surrey or in the England dressing room.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, back at the Rose Bowl, Pietersen found his England exile followed by banishment by Surrey \u2013 he was made to field on the long-off/third-man boundary, where he fielded under a vast black sightscreen, standing in for the dark cloud his international career is under. At just the time he might have been walking in to play a heroic, match-winning innings for a struggling England side at Lord's, he was sprinting in from the boundary in an effort to turn a two for Hampshire's Michael Carberry into a single.</p> <p>At the end of the match Surrey's cricket manager, Chris Adams, said: \"Kevin's a world-class player and he's been outstanding when he's been in our duty of care. I had a great conversation with him this morning. He very clearly enjoys playing for England, too, and it's very clear to me that he's seeking an outcome [on Wednesday] which allows him to continue his international career.\"</p>",
  "<p>The white cliffs of Dover have a very special place in the collective imagination, even for those who have never seen them. Nat Burton, who wrote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%28There%27ll_Be_Bluebirds_Over%29_The_White_Cliffs_of_Dover\" title=\"\">Vera Lynn's famous song about the cliffs</a>, was an American who had never crossed the Atlantic, let alone the Channel. We should harness their emotive and symbolic power, as we should with many other features of our coast and countryside, to help build a sense of togetherness and nationhood.</p> <p>Over several decades, politicians and commentators have fretted that Great Britain has become a disunited kingdom. Last summer's riots were the most troubling sign yet that a large minority does not feel the police, authorities or even shopping centres are really theirs.</p> <p>This year, the jubilee and the Olympics have papered over the cracks, providing a reassuring sense of \"coming together\". We'll be reminded of another such moment at the end of this month, with the 15th anniversary of the death of Princess Diana. But the truth is many of us were left baffled by the mass hysteria prompted by Diana's death, and cold by the flag-waving surrounding the diamond jubilee. Big sporting events and spectacles might give the national morale a shot in the arm, but they are too transient and taste-specific to stand as robust symbols of nationhood.</p> <p>The facets of Britain fit to bind us must have two characteristics. First, they need to be deep and abiding, connecting us to the past in order that we may confidently face the future. But this conservative element needs its progressive complement, which is that they need to express forward-looking values that are inclusive and universal.</p> <p>Both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair spoke of the importance of shared values rather than institutions for forging national identity. But neither prime minister found their symbolic counterparts, and simply draped the tired old union flag over anything new and exciting that could be rebranded by having \"Brit\" slapped on as a suffix.</p> <p>However, we have the right symbols ready made in those features of the natural environment that everyone recognises as meaning \"home\". The coast has a particular role to play here, as Blair recognised when he linked virtues of tolerance, openness and adaptability to \"our unique island geography and history\".</p> <p>It's this history that distinguishes the meaning of our coast from that of the Bay of Biscay or Bondi beach. Dover's cliffs call to mind the Roman invasion; the Battle of Britain; our proximity to, yet difference from, mainland Europe; and international trade and exploration, both fair and exploitative. These are reminders that our values have an ambiguous history, and they need to evolve to preserve the best of the past while enabling better from the future.</p> <p>But perhaps most important, the coast is both a border and a porous point of entry, and so the cliffs remind us that we are a nation of immigrants. That is something the country still seems to be ambivalent about. On the one hand, the diversity it has created will be celebrated again at this weekend's Notting Hill Carnival. On the other, when the latest quarterly immigration statistics come out on the 30th, the general assumption will be that the lower the figure, the better the news.</p> <p>But go back far enough and all of us can trace our ancestry to the other side of the water. Looking out over the port of Dover, with the endless steam of boats coming in and out, every British citizen is reminded that belonging here has never been about blood or genes. It's simply about being at home on this discrete island and being aware of the privileges and responsibilities that brings. Hence the cliffs have the rare ability to create a shared sense of identity that also fully acknowledges our differences.</p> <p>The National Trust looks after 7km of the cliffs and it is raising funds to buy a critical missing 1.35km section. More than 11,000 donations, adding up to over \u00a3800k has been raised so far, suggesting that there is indeed something about the cliffs that resonates with the British. In the trust's hands, unlike other purported symbols of national pride, they remain accessible to everyone and free from corporate sponsors and governments seeking to bask in their reflected glory. But the appeal might also help shift our perceptions of the nation as well as the trust \u2013 no longer defined by stately homes, with their history of blue-blood and privilege, but with the open-spaces whose history embraces us all.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012. The original referred to the flag-waving surrounding the golden jubilee rather than the diamond jubilee. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, lashed out at the \"highly imperialist-orientated Man Booker prize\", whose winners have alternated \"between largely upper-middle-class English writers and citizens of the former colonies, presumably to stamp legitimacy on this 'global accolade'\".</p> <p>Speaking at the <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international writers' conference</a>, he added that the organisers' failure to refute accusations of anti-Scottishness, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jul/27/booker-prize-bias-english\" title=\"\">already voiced by Scottish writers such as Alan Bissett</a>, was a sign of \"arrogance\" and \"intellectual enfeeblement\".</p> <p>Welsh, who is famous for using Scottish dialect in his novels, said: \"The Booker prize's contention to be an inclusive, non-discriminatory award could be demolished by anybody with even a rudimentary grasp of sixth-form sociology.\"</p> <p>The award, he said, was \"based on the conceit that upper-class Englishness is the cultural yardstick against which all literature must be measured\".</p> <p>Welsh <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/19/irvine-welsh-a-national-literature\" title=\"\">was speaking </a>on the third day of the five-day conference, held at the <a href=\"http://www.edbookfest.co.uk\" title=\"\">Edinburgh international book festival</a>. The event is a restaging of the famous <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/background/\" title=\"\">1962 Edinburgh writers' conference</a> when Rebecca West and Mary McCarthy snarled at each other; the then unknown William Burroughs \u2013 who was staying with Alexander Trocchi's doctor so they could both be amply supplied with heroin \u2013 sprang on to the international literary scene; and Muriel Spark said very little except what was icily to the point.</p> <p>Welsh, giving the keynote address at the session on nationalism, said that the rise of globalised culture meant it \"would be difficult for Trainspotting to be published today by a London-based publisher. The market has become much more defined and Trainspotting doesn't fit into any defined slot.\"</p> <p>In a wide-ranging debate on localism, regionalism and nationalism in literature \u2013 without the near-fisticuffs that characterised the 1962 version, but with passionate applause for writers' statements and a certain amount of barracking against Ian Rankin's chairing of the session \u2013 Glasgow-based author Ewan Morrison argued that universalism, the great ideal of the postwar world, had been most effectively harnessed by global capitalism, and must at all costs be fought against. As Bissett put it, \"protectionism for local cultures is sometimes necessary\".</p> <p>But Ben Okri, who won the 1991 Booker prize for The Famished Road, contested the terms of the argument, quoting Wole Soyinka's statement that a tiger doesn't debate its \"tigritude\"; it just pounces.</p> <p>Okri continued: \"The writer writes. As well as they can, as truthfully as they can from the depth of their spirits \u2026 If you say this space is Scottishness, you have limited the possibilities of Scottishness for all time \u2026 if you overdefine what is a national literature you will constantly reproduce a cycle of cliches.\"</p> <p>The previous day's debate on style versus content saw the work of EL James condemned as \"fucking dangerous\" by poet Nick Laird, and \"mental vomit\" by poet and essayist Kapka Kassabova.</p> <p>The session was kicked off by novelist Ali Smith <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/18/ali-smith-novelists-approach-art\" title=\"\">with a virtuoso provocation</a>: style, she said, was a kind of roaring with life. \"Style \u2026 makes what's being told,\" she said. \"A story is its style.\"</p> <p>But could style \u2013 think of James Joyce \u2013 make books inaccessible? Bissett said: \"I worry how style can exclude. You think about the people who are not convinced by literature and find it for a small elite \u2026 Style risks become fetishised and it becomes stylish people talking to one another.\"</p> <p>China Mi\u00e9ville disagreed: the argument \"risks being patronising\", he said. He added: \"If we try to second-guess readers it's a fool's game \u2026 Our job is not to give readers what they want, it is to try to make readers want what we give.</p> <p>\"Increasingly one reads books that are beautifully put and rather bloodless and anodyne. And I would much rather read an honourable failure than a dishonourable success, particularly in the case of style.\"</p> <p>The Argentinian writer Carlos Gamerro agreed: \"Three cheers for difficult writers who write for other writers!\"</p> <p>The first session had raised the question: should literature be political? Ahdaf Soueif, the Egyptian novelist and essayist, said it was too soon for her homeland's revolution to be fictionalised.</p> <p>\"A truly imagined and felt novel of the Egyptian revolution? I don't see how it can be done,\" she said. When the novelist was wrapped up in activism, the space and time and nuance for fiction could not emerge, she argued.</p> <p>Okri agreed: \"When your house is burning, your first job is to put the fire out: you don't write as a way of putting out the fire.\"</p> <p>Mi\u00e9ville said that the contents of a work could be overstated. Because the novel was a commodified art form (like it or lump it) various avenues of \"cultural performance\" were made possible; when Iain Banks's calling for a cultural boycott of Israel in 2010 was a powerful act, even though \"he writes about space ships\" and not Palestine.</p> <p>It was left to the Chinese poet Xi Chuan to question the idea of the moral purpose of the novel.</p> <p>\"We are taking it for granted that we are all good people, kind people, as we talk about this topic. But another question might be: should literature be fascist? Should be literature be Stalinist?</p> <p>\"There are hidden meanings here. Should literature be something that expresses your values, to show that you are a good or a kind person?\"</p>",
  "<p>Many of us are already cyborgs. If you have a contraceptive coil fitted, or a pacemaker \u2013 arguably even if you wear contact lenses or have pierced ears \u2013 then you are in a sense part-human and part-machine.

For a party trick, they can also pick up metal objects or make other magnets move around.</p> <p>Calling this a procedure, though, gives rather the wrong impression.

If you think this sounds painful, you are correct.</p> <p>Britain is the birthplace of modern transhumanism, as the field is known. Probably the most sophisticated implantation ever made can be found inside the left arm of <a href=\"http://www.kevinwarwick.com/\" title=\"\">Kevin Warwick</a>, professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading, who can now control a robot arm by moving his own. The system also works the other way, so he can now sense his wife's movements in his own body, after she had a similar implantation.</p> <p>A more intuitive exponent is <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/transcending-the-human-diy-style/\" title=\"\">Lepht Anonym</a>, the&#xa0;name used by a young woman in Aberdeen, who has performed many <a href=\"http://sapiensanonym.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">adaptations on herself at home</a> using nothing more sophisticated than sharp implements and vodka. She began with a sensor that allowed her to lock and unlock her computer, and then fitted a temperature display that emerged through the skin, though this was not a success.</p> <p>To Warwick, Anonym and the wider grinding community, who meet online in forums such as <a href=\"http://discuss.biohack.me/\" title=\"\">biohack.me</a>, implanted technology or \"wetware\" represents the next stage in mankind's evolution. And, indeed, the idea is not outlandish. Brain stimulation from implanted electrodes is already a routine treatment for Parkinson's and other diseases, and there are prototypes that promise to let paralysed people control computers, wheelchairs and robotic limbs.</p> <p>Last week, X-Men producer Bryan Singer launched <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/08/14/h_from_bryan_singer_web_tv_series_explores_transhumanism_video_.html\" title=\"\">a web TV&#xa0;series called H+</a> prophesying&#xa0;the cataclysmic consequences of all this.

The Kickstarter bonanza was made possible by a decade of tireless communication with fans, as a solo artist as well as half of <a href=\"http://www.dresdendolls.com/\" title=\"\">the Dresden Dolls</a>, the \"Brechtian punk cabaret\" band currently on hiatus. She has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amandapalmer\" title=\"\">taken to Twitter</a> like a natural. Her followers (currently approaching 600,000) tracked her flirtation with Gaiman over several months, and found out about their surprise wedding two years ago via <a href=\"http://starcasm.net/archives/79748\" title=\"\">a tweeted photograph</a>. \"I realised making that announcement was one of the most significant moments in our marriage because that's where our friends all are,\" she says, waving her metallic-green iPhone. \"It may seem like an ephemeral, insignificant platform to some but, the way I use it, it's a very functional community space like a bar or a living room. Twitter fascinates me because it's real. It feels kind of unreal, but it makes very real things happen.\"</p> <p>She imposes some restrictions on herself. She won't tweet or blog about anyone who asks her not to, and she won't be negative. Years ago, she wrote an angry blog about being mistreated in an upmarket piano shop and realised to her horror that she had unleashed a flood of hate mail on the shop from supportive Dresden Dolls fans. \"I&#xa0;remember thinking, 'Oh,&#xa0;I&#xa0;really have a lot of power here. I&#xa0;have to wield it very carefully.'\"</p> <p>However, she holds nothing back about herself. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-palmer/on-abortion-rape-and-humo_b_166782.html\" title=\"\">In a 2009 blog defending her song Oasis</a>, a blackly comic number about abortion and date rape, she mentioned in passing that she had experienced both.\"I think I've been addicted to openness since long before&#xa0;my rock career. I was terrible as&#xa0;a teenager. I used to go out of my way to make people uncomfortable with personal details. I was always fascinated by the idea that we have these weird, random boundaries between what we do and don't show.\"</p> <p>This extreme emotional candour feeds into her songs, whose tart sting sometimes suggests a piano-playing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/jul/30/edinburghfestival2005.classics\" title=\"\">Dorothy Parker</a> and explains her cult appeal among the similarly arty and intense (Lady Gaga is a fan). Inspired in her youth by performance artists, she has been an artist's model, a stripper and, for several years, a living statue in Cambridge, Massachusetts's Harvard Square, where she learned long before Kickstarter that you can, in fact, rely on the kindness of strangers. At the end of&#xa0;the Village Underground show,&#xa0;she disrobes and invites fans to scrawl on her naked body.</p> <p>\"I've always had an insatiable desire to be looked at,\" she admits. \"I was born ready for the stage.&#xa0;I was the youngest of four kids and, from day one, the look-at-me one.&#xa0;But I got a lot of, 'Amanda, quit trying to get attention.' Nobody wants&#xa0;to be seen as an attention-getter&#xa0;because it's narcissistic and selfish and icky. Really&#xa0;good performers who have that&#xa0;hunger figure out how to use it to connect, rather than just suck energy. I&#xa0;didn't want to be a pathetic psycho prancing around on stage, desperate for love. So I went through this whole struggle of despising myself and not being able to&#xa0;figure myself out. It took ages. Thank God my best friend's a therapist.\" She laughs loudly.</p> <p>At the moment, life is hectic. While she still lives in Boston, Gaiman is based in the midwest. \"My next big creative step is to write a book about how to be two married artists who barely see each other and manage to stay in love,\" she says. As well as touring commitments, she has to deliver the rewards she promised on Kickstarter, including 35 private concerts in donors' houses. Gaiman recently told Wired that he thought of everything his wife does as \"one giant interconnected piece of performance art called Amanda Palmer. Amanda Palmer gets painted, Amanda Palmer tweets, Amanda Palmer makes an album \u2013 it all sort of ties in. It's all about connection.\"</p> <p>\"I know a lot of musicians who are way less social than I am,\" says Palmer, \"and they are flabbergasted that I have the desire to go out there and forge the connections and deal with the crap that inevitably goes with it. But to me, being a social artist is its own artform. And, luckily, I <em>like</em> the fans.\"</p> <p>Palmer tells a story about when she was 18 and her favourite band, Anglo-Dutch art-rockers the <a href=\"http://legendarypinkdots.org/\" title=\"\">Legendary Pink Dots</a>, played in Boston. They stayed at the house of one of Palmer's friends, who invited her over and insisted she play them her demo tape. It was terrifying, but then she went outside for a cigarette with the band's singer and he told her, sincerely, that her music was great.</p> <p>\"My head exploded,\" she says, animated by the memory. \"I walked on air for four days. It was like someone had come over to me with a magic wand and said: You have legitimate permission to go forth and be a rock star. He didn't have to say that. He didn't have to listen to my demo tape. He could have fucked off and gone to bed. And that,\" she firmly concludes, \"is the spirit that I wanted to live in.\"</p>",
  "<p>The heritage of protest and provocation on which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/pussy-riot-profile-nadezhda-tolokonnikova\" title=\"\">Nadezhda Tolokonnikova</a> was drawing was confirmed as soon as I saw her picture. The hair cut into a functional bob, the \"No Pasaran\" T\u2011shirt with the clenched-fist logo, her leading place in a band-cum-collective called Pussy Riot \u2013 it was as if she had been plucked from the Anglo-American <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/03/pussy-riot-kremlin-protest-riot-grrrl\" title=\"\">subculture known as riot grrrl</a> circa 1992, and dropped into modern Russia.</p> <p>This time, though, the surrounding contexts had been changed beyond recognition. As with their antecedents, Pussy Riot are young feminists with a scattershot critique of their society, but their chosen target and awful predicament place them almost in a different universe \u2013 as proved when Tolokonnikova and her two co-defendants laughed as they were given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">their two-year sentences</a>. You could call such behaviour \"cool\", but in this instance, another word is surely required: one that mixes jaw-dropping bravery with impossible insouciance, and has \u2013 as far as I know \u2013 yet to be invented.</p> <p>In the west, we seem to have forgotten that popular culture once produced people who thought it was their duty to&#xa0;decry some of the most ingrained aspects of their societies, and thereby become lightning-rods for dissent. But the rise to prominence of Tolokonnikova et al proves that outside the UK and US, old ideas can assume new shapes and actually take on even greater power (and survive even an endorsement from that cause-squashing menace Madonna, which takes some doing).</p> <p>To be a mohican-wearing punk in London is to be a kitsch throwback \u2013 but in Indonesia or Burma, it can put you on&#xa0;the receiving end of heinous treatment from the authorities. Similarly, in&#xa0;London or Los Angeles, the legacy represented by Pussy Riot can perhaps only be glimpsed in an abiding strain of female fashion you can buy on any high street, whereas in Russia it will soon be on display in a penal colony.</p> <p>So, some history. Riot grrrl was the work of a handful of people in Olympia, Washington, and Washington DC, who sought to update punk rock \u2013 and, with the US religious right in full cry and women's rights under attack, apply its noise and fury to the politics of gender. Initially, Riot Grrrl was the title of a fanzine put together by four women who would soon form two bands, Bikini Kill and Bratmobile. The former remain a byword for what followed: the aggression and power of what its makers called \"boy rock\" being rechannelled by proud feminists, and unapologetic celebrations of the worldview of the female adolescent (hence \"grrrl\").</p> <p>In the UK, the torch was carried by a mixed-gender band called Huggy Bear, who made one unimpeachably brilliant record \u2013 Her Jazz, released in 1993 \u2013 and gained brief renown for protesting on-screen against the moronic sexism of the woeful Channel 4 show The Word, before they quickly disappeared. For a&#xa0;brief moment, they had the music industry terrified that they knew the shape of the future but had no intention of giving it away.</p> <p>Obviously, compared with Pussy Riot,&#xa0;these people's targets were almost comically modest and their supposed subversion often reducible to radical chic, but the lines that link the two upsurges are obvious. Pyotr Versilov \u2013 Tolokonnikova's husband, and thanks to&#xa0;his fluency in English, one of Pussy Riot's key spokespeople \u2013 acknowledges that the collective's name \"<a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-husband-of-pussy-riot-member-nadezhda-tolokonnikova-a-849730.html\" title=\"\">is a reference to the riot grrrl movement</a> that arose in the United States in the early 1990s, based on a concept of feminine strength, not weakness\".</p> <p>In an interview published by Vice magazine five months ago, a Pussy Riot member who identified herself as Garadzha said that \"a lot of credit certainly goes to Bikini Kill and the bands in the riot grrrl act [sic] \u2013 we somehow developed what they did in the 1990s, although in an absolutely different context and with an exaggerated political stance\". Listen to the new Pussy Riot song they have titled Putin Lights Up the Fires \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-release-new-single-video\" title=\"\">premiered by the Guardian last Friday</a>. All screeched vocals and granite-hard guitar, it's a product of exactly the same aesthetic.</p> <p>Such comparisons, however, shrink next to a much more powerful point. Like the original proponents of riot grrrl,&#xa0;only a thousand times more so, Pussy Riot are an object lesson in what cultural provocation can do, while orthodox politics and protest too often remain impotent \u2013 a point always lost on&#xa0;those who would restrict dissent to the usual staid norms. On <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9744000/9744906.stm\" title=\"\">last Friday's Radio 4 Today programme</a>, the historian Robert Service played his part to perfection, pompously advising the BBC to \"get some sense of proportion\". On he&#xa0;grumped: \"There are really serious critics of Vladimir Putin in Russia who deserve our attention much more than these three misguided young feminist rock musicians who have desecrated a&#xa0;cathedral.\"</p> <p>That may be so, but history suggests that it's the allegedly \"misguided\" who often make the biggest waves. There were critics of De Gaulle's France who may have had a greater claim to serious attention than the <em>enrages</em> of May 1968, and republicans who had a more coherent take on the toxicity of 1977's jubilee celebrations than the Sex Pistols, who so gloriously spoiled the celebrations with a single titled God Save the Queen. But in both cases, it took the daring and creativity of cultural outsiders to crystallise the sense that their societies were not just hopelessly conflicted, but in no shape to go on as they were.</p> <p>Politics is about increment and compromise; in the cultural sphere, you are free to be as exacting and impossiblist as you please, and thereby say and do things that the moment actually demands. And look what can happen: as the aftershocks of the Pussy Riot case ripple on, even some of Putin's allies do not know where to look. \"Our image in the eyes of the world is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/18/pussy-riot-russia-global-protest\" title=\"\">getting closer to a medieval dictatorship</a>, though we are not that,\" says one of the president's loudest media cheerleaders: the mask that covers power at its most cynical looks to have slipped, at least.</p> <p>What does all this tell us? That the Anglo-American world still sleeps, having sent forth cultural archetypes that have exploded all over the world. That in some places, culture actually still matters. And that in the macho dystopia of Putin's Russia, where everything cultural is political and vice versa, three remarkable women have gone to prison to prove it.</p>",
  "<p>Shell is paying Nigerian security forces tens of millions of dollars a year to guard their installations and staff in the Niger delta, according to leaked internal financial data seen by the Guardian. The oil giant also maintains a 1,200-strong internal police force in Nigeria, plus a network of plainclothes informants.</p> <p>According to the data, the world's largest company by revenue spent nearly $1bn on worldwide security between 2007-09: if it were a country Shell would have the third highest security budget in Africa, after South Africa and Nigeria itself.</p> <p>The documents show that nearly 40% of Shell's total security expenditure over the three year period \u2013 $383m (\u00a3244m) \u2013 was spent on protecting its staff and installations in Nigeria's volatile Niger delta region. In 2009, $65m was spent on Nigerian government forces and $75m on \"other\" security costs \u2013 believed to be a mixture of private security firms and payments to individuals.</p> <p>Activists expressed concern that the escalating cost of Shell's security operation in the delta was further destabilising the oil rich region and helping to fuel rampant corruption and criminality. \"The scale of Shell's global security expenditure is colossal,\" said Ben Amunwa of London-based oil watchdog Platform. \"It is staggering that Shell transferred $65m of company funds and resources into the hands of soldiers and police known for routine human rights abuses.\"</p> <p>The financial documents, <a href=\"http://t.co/fHAITY4j\">passed to Platform</a>, suggest Shell's worldwide security costs almost doubled between 2007-2009, coinciding with the rise of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/10/oil.world\" title=\"\">armed insurgency in the Niger delta</a>.</p> <p>In 2008, 62 Shell employees or contractors were kidnapped and three killed, many Shell-operated pipelines, well heads and offshore oil platforms were attacked and the company was forced to halt oil exports for several weeks after attacks by groups including the Movement for the emancipation of the Niger delta.</p> <p>Nearly a third of Shell's global security budget in 2008, or $99m, was spent on \"third parties\". This was double what the company spent on its own security staff and is believed to include the services of 600 Nigerian government police and 700 members of the controversial state \"joint task force\" (JTF) comprised of army, navy and police.</p> <p>Shell denies having any direct control over JTF forces, amid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/21/hundreds-killed-niger-delta\" title=\"\">numerous accusations of human rights abuses</a>, including a large-scale military attack in 2009 which the US state department said led to the displacement and loss of livelihood of tens of thousands of residents.</p> <p>But in the past Shell has supplied government forces with gunboats, helicopters, vehicles and satellite phones to better patrol the myriad creeks and waterways of the delta.</p> <p>\"This proves what we in the Niger delta have known for years \u2013 that the air force, the army, the police, they are paid for with Shell money and they are all at the disposal of the company for it to use it any how it likes,\" said Celestine Nkabari at the Niger delta campaign group Social Action.</p> <p>According to Platform, a significant amount of Shell funding is channelled via senior military officials which provides \"ample opportunities for corruption\". US cables, released by WikiLeaks in 2010, alleged that the company paid hundreds of thousands of pounds towards the deployment of 350 soldiers in the delta in 2003.</p> <p>But Shell International said that any allegations of corruption should be addressed to the Nigerian authorities, and that its spending is necessary to protect its staff and operations.</p> <p>Although armed insurgency in the oil producing regions of the delta has declined since a 2009 amnesty, the company says it faces widespread criminality, organised crime and massive oil theft. It has stated that 15-20% of its output is stolen by international gangs.</p> <p>\"Protecting our people and our assets is Shell's highest priority,\" it said. \"Our spending on security is carefully judged to meet this objective, wherever we operate in the world. We have always acknowledged the difficulties of working in countries like Nigeria. In the period that this report refers to, the armed militancy in the Niger delta was at its height, requiring a relatively high level of security spending there.</p> <p>\"All our staff and contractors are expected to adhere to the highest levels of personal and corporate ethics, as set out in our code of conduct. We support the Voluntary principles on security and human rights (VPSHR), and we recognise that these principles help maintain the safety and security of our operations in a manner consistent with upholding human rights. We also investigate grievances under the VPSHR.\"</p> <p>The company declined to comment on whether worldwide costs for security were increasing because of the Arab spring. The company has recently left Syria and has interests throughout the Middle East.</p> <p>But the scale of Shell's spending, revealed by the data for the first time, raises questions about the effectiveness of its security policies. \"What is striking about the amount being spent in Nigeria is its ineffectiveness,\" said Amunwa. \"Shell spent many millions of dollars each year on government forces who failed to provide the company with adequate security.\"</p> <p>Nkabari said: \"Shell cannot call this spending 'security'. If it was really providing security, then why do we continue to have vandalisation, why do we have bunkering [theft of oil], why do we have the security mess that we have in the Niger delta? They give protection to the oil workers but they are not providing the region with 'security'.\"</p> <p>\"These figures are alarming \u2013 it is a scandal that so much money is spent on security instead of on the local communities whose livelihoods are destroyed as a result of the oil exploitation,\" said Jaff Napoleon Bamenjo of Relufa, which campaigns for environmental justice in west Africa.</p> <p>\"Across Africa oil, mining and agro-industry companies regularly pay for the services of local security forces that have deplorable human rights records; sometimes as a contractual obligation,\" said Bamenjo. \"This is an extremely unethical practice held over from the colonial era which must end immediately. Not only is it bad for local communities who are the primary victims of police and military predation, but as Shell well knows, it exposes foreign companies to lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <h2>Manchester City v Southampton preview</h2> <p>Southampton can take immense pride in the consecutive promotions with which Nigel Adkins has restored the club to the top flight, <em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/squad-sheets-manchester-city-southampton\">wrote Kevin McCarra in yesterday's Guardian</a></em>, but this game might be seen as a trial for a club that has come so far so soon. It would be a surprise if Manchester City did not revel in the occasion at the Etihad Stadium. The manager, Roberto Mancini, seemed frustrated this summer by a halt to the large-scale recruitment policy of the past, but a settled squad may be formidable as players improve their rapport with one another.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> The last time we saw Southampton in the Premier League, a second-half Ruud van Nistelrooy goal scuppered their hopes of avoiding relegation (well, that and the two scored by Geoff Horfield and Kieran Richardson, which made West Brom safe); Rupert Lowe attempted to defend his reign to protestors by highlighting the quality of the catering at St Mary's; and Harry Redknapp promised that if he left the club it would be to retire, not to mosey back to Portsmouth having made up his differences with Milan Mandaric. But enough nostalgia! Today Nigel Adkins's side is here on a tailwind after two successive promotions and the club is about to break its transfer record for the second time this summer with the signing of Bologna's Gaston Ramirez. The money could perhaps do with being spent at the back, however - Southampton were pretty sound last season, but there isn't much pressure on Jose Fonte's place and that 4-0 pre-season defeat to Udinese will feel rather more ominous given that the season starts against Manchester City.</p> <p>The last time we saw City in the Premier League, of course, they were busy winning it. Really busy. Roberto Mancini's side didn't let QPR touch the ball in the final 45 minutes of last season but took until stoppage time to score the decisive goals - one either side of the whistle blowing on Manchester United's 1-0 win over Sunderland. United finished their match top of the table but were bumped down to second before they could get to the dressing room and crack open the T-shirts. Now Mancini and Sir Alex Ferguson are arguing about which of the two teams has the best chance of taking this year's title (\"No, <em>you're</em> squad is peachiest\" - we're about three days from FACTS if things carry on as they are), but with United playing Everton tomorrow, City must admit to having the \"easier\" start. True, they're in unfamiliar territory just as Southampton are, having a title to defend for the first time since the 68-69 season. And true, they've no firm idea of their opponents, prompting Mancini to remind everyone that it took City almost an hour to get going against newcomers Swansea at this point last season, but it's probably the next bit of his sentence that we should pay attention to: \"We might have won that game 4-0 in the end, but...\"</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> <br>Manchester City (apparently abandoning 3-5-2 for 4-4-2): Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy, Toure, Rodwell, Silva, Nasri, Tevez, Aguero. </p> <p>Southampton (apparently abandoning common sense): Davis, Clyne, Fonte, Hooiveld, Fox, Ward-Prowse, Schneiderlin, Lallana, Puncheon, Guly, Rodriguez.</p> <p>So no Rickie Lambert or Billy Sharp for Southampton, with Guly do Prado preferred up front with the new boy Jay Rodriguez and Jason Puncheon. James Ward-Prowse's pre-season seems to have done the trick, too; the 17-year-old starts in the three-man midfield.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Debutant Jack Rodwell</strong>: Jamie Redknapp has just used the word 'dream' three times, and the phrase 'a good size' twice.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>A bit of moaning cleverly disguised as betting information</strong> You'll get odds of 5/4 on Manchester City winning the Best League in the World this season, while Southampton are 3500/1.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Challenging</strong><br>\"This is it now, it's a marvellous feeling, there's a buzz in the dressing room,\" reports Nigel Adkins, who's wearing a father-of-the-bride grin. \"We know it's going to be challenging, we've got to make sure it's as challenging for the opposition as well. Today we're presented with different challenges; Guly's done well in pre-season... and what great players to bring off the bench.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>4 minutes and 35 seconds before kick off</strong> - the timing of the first mention of Robin van Persie. More than 22 players who are not Robin van Persie are gathering in the tunnel. </p> <p>My inbox has a habit of diverting emails to quarantine during live events. A prize* to the first person who manages to get something interesting and/or funny through the Automated Random Email Bouncer.</p> <p>* <em>There is no prize except pride</em></p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Kick off</strong> After a high-tempo chorus of Blue Moon, Howard Webb's Howard Webb blows his whistle to get the game underway, the ball rolling from the toe of Aguero to Tevez, today sporting a turned up collar. City wear their pale blue home kit, Southampton are in all-red.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> David Silva is removed from the pitch because the tape around his ankles does not match the blue of his socks. Oh football.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> Rodwell gets the first applause of the afternoon, sliding in to clear the ball from Lallana's feet after the Southampton winger had beaten Kompany. Southampton don't manage to get the corner into the box, though, and City move as one towards the other end of the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> A lively, bustling start from Southampton, this, and they've probed down both flanks to see what mischief they might be able to make. Guly is halted just as he tries to work in from the right, though, and City are only halted by the offside flag, held up to signal that Tevez had gone too early. It was a well-directed early pass from Kompany, and one that would have presented Southampton with problems had Tevez waited a second.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> Clyne makes a good tackle to dispossess Aguero, running down City's left, but he catches the City forward's leg under him as they both slide across the turf, and Aguero seems to have twisted his knee - he looks in real pain, and tenses as the physios try to manipulate it. Mario Balotelli is warming up.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Aguero is up and hobbling towards the sideline, booed by the Southampton fans and raucously cheered by his own. \"I've never actually watched Nathaniel Clyne play \"real\" football before, but I do know that he develops into a world class, marauding right back in Fifa 12 Manager mode,\" guffaws Dan Schulwolf. I said there would be pride, I didn't say the bar would be set high.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Schneiderlin's shot from just outside the area never really looked like it would trouble Hart's goal without the interference of a crease in the Etihad turf, but Southampton are upset not to have been given a free-kick for Lescott's scything tackle on Rodriguez, who turned nicely after Guly's slaloming run on the right. Aguero is being stretchered off, and it's Edin Dzeko coming on in his place.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> A chance at the other end as Dzeko sneaks between two defenders and gets the ball in behind them, but the Southampton defence recovers in time to block his effort and Silva's follow-up. Moments later Zabaleta strokes a shot goalwards and it's deflected across goal, but cleared.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>16 min PENALTY for City!</strong> Hooiveld points to the ball but it's not clear why - it is busy bimbling over the byline while Tevez, with whom he actually did make contact, is lying on the floor in the area.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>17 min MISSED PENALTY for City!</strong> What an abysmal effort by Silva, virtually bobbling across the turf and straight to Kelvin Davis, who went the right way but probably had time to go the wrong way and get back again to save that.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Tevez is weaving those little trails around the penalty box that lend you to thinking that a goal is only a matter of time. He doesn't quite manage to combined with Zabaleta this time, but the No5 is pretty much camped on his shoulder.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> City are having more of the ball, but are currently trapped between the halfway line and the edge of Southampton's area. \"Why can't they use clear tape on their socks???\" Andrew Goudie demands to know - look, there are three question marks and everything. I think we all know that this merely presents the clubs with an additional branding opportunity.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> Dzeko and Silva try to Arsenal the ball through about eight Southampton players camped just inside the penalty box, which ends with the latter on his backside and the ball being hoofed away. I'm not sure there was a shot on, really, but they were never going to thread the ball through that tangle of legs.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> We're just under halfway in and it's probably just about legitimate to start asking whether Southampton will have the energy for this in the second half. City are dictating things all over the pitch, with Tevez, Silva and Zabaleta combining well down the right. Tevez's cross from that area was destined for the forehead of Dzeko until Fonte's leap enables him to intercept and send it skimming over everybody.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> City make down the left this time, Clichy swinging a cross in for Fonte to clear. Nasri's corner swooshes behind everyone in the penalty area though, and the home side have to work from the beginning again. Southampton have retreated somewhat, with only Guly beyond the centre circle.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> I'll mention that Tevez shot, as it's the done thing, but Davis probably wasn't that worried about it. There was a moment of high excitement as Tevez ran on to the ball in the D, but he hit it straight at the Southampton keeper.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Toure is penalised for a clunking tackle from behind, giving Southampton a free-kick a few yards inside City's half - they try to work it goalwards, though, and come unstuck about two passes forward. A moment later Lallana launches a cross in from the left which Zabaleta handles; this free-kick will definitely be launched into the area.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Nasri heads the free-kick out for a corner,but Hooiveld and Rodriguez both go for it and end up getting in each other's way. Somewhere in the Sky studio, they'll-have-to-make-the-most-of-those-chances is being saddled up and given a palm full of sugar cubes.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> We're still stuck on David Silva's socks. \"How many managers are now wondering if they can have him removed from the pitch as his name doesn't match the rest of his kit?\" puns Phil.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>40 min GOAL! Tevez!</strong> Finally a pass that penetrates the Southampton lines, Nasri taking a moment to assess the situation and then stroking the ball with his instep for Tevez, who takes one look at Davis and then slides the ball in close to the near post. There's a suspicion of offside, there, but Gary Neville says Clyne was playing Tevez on, and I'm not arguing with that haircut.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> A disappointing way for Southampton to concede, that: it's almost half time and even if Tevez was offside, Davis will surely feel he should have done better with a shot that wasn't far from him. He manages to block and then gather Dzeko's shot, hit as he slid to the ground trying to turn his man, mind.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>45 +2 min</strong> The board says four minutes of added time, accounted for by Aguero's injury. City look in the mood to keep the ball for that entire time, Zabaleta sticking to his role as an auxiliary winger and zipping the ball across the area to Nasri to set off a string of passes that weave backwards and forwards across the penalty box. Davis makes a good block but can't scoop the ball up and it's stabbed back to Silva, but his shot is blocked at source.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Half time</strong> There's a hint of a young Steven Gerrard in full Roy of the Rovers mode about Lallana as he strides up through the middle, hoping that gravitational pull might bring his teammates with him, but he's forced to pass backwards and the half ends with a looping ball forward bouncing in to Hart's palms.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half time nonsense (not the same as in-play nonsense)</strong><br>\"Please give us a shout-out in the MBM,\" beg Alison Walters and Chris Mulligan, English ex-pats in Washington DC. \"After being forced to watch Euro 2012 <em>and</em> the Olympics on US television, we are now sorely missing home coverage. We're even missing Alan Shearer on Match of the Day.\" Hand yourselves in to your nearest embassy immediately.</p> <p>What's the best dunking biscuit? I find two small biscuits sandwiched around some buttercream makes for a good dunking experience, though digestives are an obvious choice to withstand high temperatures. Has anyone ever successfully dunked with oaty ones?</p> <p>Nathan Paterson has a slightly more important question: \"Was Tevez booked for his celebration [lifting his shirt to reveal a message] or does this not happen anymore?\" He wasn't booked, but I don't know if that's because of a rule change or just that Webb missed it. That's certainly possible - Tevez only lifted his shirt as you do when you get home after a particularly sweaty car journey, not over his face.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Guly and Lallana kick off the second half, Southampton playing from left to right and looking for a goal to draw them level.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> Geoff Shreeves reports that City are cautiously optimistic about Aguero's injury, before heading off to tell Aguero that his goatee looks rubbish, just to level things up. \"I've always found ginger nuts work pretty well for dunking,\" says Jamie Tucker. \"Not only do they not fall apart, but they genuinely taste much better once laden with tea (and I quite like them anyway).\" They do, don't they? \"Can't say they work so well with coffee, mind.\" You'd be hard pressed to find many biscuits that work well with coffee.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>50 min</strong> Almost a second for City! Nasri twisted and turned to shrug off the attentions of Clyne, who kept coming back until eventually he got too dizzy and fell over, giving Nasri the chance to poke the ball along the byline and then ping it back to Dzeko. There's a suggestion that he wasn't expecting the ball, thus explaining the poor touch that goes straight to Davis, but the replay seems to show that he steadied himself for a shot and just miscued the contact.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Oof, Toure's arrived for the season ladies and gentleman, chipping a cute pass up and over to Clichy, who shoots with his first touch but can't find the target. \"Bourbons,\" Tweets Mike Gibbons. \"Accept no substitute.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> Puncheon - back on his own byline - loses control of the ball to concede a corner, from which most of the crowd shouts for a handball as a Zabaleta's shot is blocked. We've had no replays so I'm not sure, but everyone seems to have gotten over it quite quickly.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>55 min </strong>Silva hits the bar! What a chance. Tevez charges down the right again, beating Fox and whipping the ball in to the middle. Davis chooses to punch it away when he probably could have caught it - or at least pushed it away from danger - allowing Nasri the chance to pop it back in for Silva. He hits it first time but the ball pings up off the bar.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Puncheon works an opening from the right and manages to find Lallana, but the ball is slightly behind him; the subsequent effort slightly wide.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>59 min GOAL! Lambert comes on for Southampton and equalises!</strong> That was very nicely struck by a player who'd been on about two minutes. Guly had an effort blocked but City could not clear the ball out of their area properly, and Lambert enjoyed a time-slowing-down moment as the ball came across the penalty area to him, sweeping it beyond Hart with his right boot.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> Everything has become a bit noisier at the Etihad since that goal, the home fans urging their players to do something with the ball that they're still seeing so much of. Lambert replaced Rodriguez, by the way.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Ward-Prowse is replaced by Steven Davis, a free transfer from Rangers. \"Hob Knobs,\" says Liam Meehan - I think we're still talking about biscuits. Ah, yes. \"Great solidity post-dunk, great aftertaste/texture. Also something to laugh at, then chastise yourself maturely.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min GOAL! Davis for Southampton!</strong> Schneiderlin concedes a free-kick about 28 yards out, for coming through the back of someone in blue. Tevez takes it after staring his best hard stare at Kelvin Davis, but he hits it straight in to the wall, and Southampton break from the resulting corner thanks to a terrible pass from Rodwell. Lallana was stopped by Lescott in the area, but kept the ball and turned to lay it off to Steven Davis, who puts it into the bottom-right corner with a low drive. Both subs have scored within moments of coming on. Nigel Adkins: tactical genius.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> What a start to life in the Premier League for Southampton; it would seem rather silly to be talking about biscuits while this is going on. \"Here's a tip for discerning mbm readers,\" says Gavin Digby. \"Cadburys chocolate fingers: bite off each end and use them as a straw to suck up the tea. Although maybe not that socially acceptable, they are delicious.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>72 min GOAL! Dzeko draws City level!</strong> This game is scarily similar to the final day of last season. Edin Dzeko has just levelled things up, poking the ball up into the net after Kompany's effort was blocked and deflected to him. Southampton attack from the restart, having two shots blocked, and then City break and Balotelli shoots in to the side-netting from about eight yards out on the left. This is cup final football!</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Stand up for the champions, shout the home fans. Southampton must be tiring now but they have a quarter of an hour to play and a Toure free-kick to defend - Davis again bats the ball out in front of him, diving to his right to keep the ball out of his goal, and Silva is crowded out of getting anything on the rebound.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Dzeko's header has just gone about a yard wide - close enough to have the crowd on their feet and Gary Neville's voice wobbling up the octaves. \"Chocolate fingers as straws are all very well,\" says Adam Fletcher, \"but the real deal is using fingers of Twix - you know you wanna.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>79 min GOAL! Nasri gives City the lead!</strong> A superb cross by Clichy from the left sets that up, Fox backpedalling to get his head to it by the far post and managing only to knock it down for Nasri rather than lifting it clear. Nasri, who has been excellent today, strikes it in to the ground and zipping up into the net. He lifts his shirt over his head to reveal 'Eid Mubarak' - I didn't see a card come out. </p> <p>You know how when you chuckle when you're really excited - meeting Su Pollard, say - and it comes out like a little seal bark? Neville's just done that. What a game this is.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> The away fans are going to have sore throats in the morning! Guly should do better than a thump-it-and-hope effort at a crowded penalty area, but the ball rebounds to a Southampton player - Lallana I think - who lays it back to Schneiderlin. His shot is deflected wide and from the corner, Lambert shoots over. It's a tough shot that he's got to hit first time, from slightly behind him.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Puncheon is subbed off and replaced by Billy Sharp. Can Southampton pull that trick off a third time? \"When it comes to dunking, shortcake are the Lionel Messi of the biscuit world.\" You are so right, Justin Kavanagh. A tin of shortcake is what makes Christmas with the family worth doing.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Lambert, coming down the left, floats the ball over the penalty area to Sharp, whose shot is blocked. Guly swipes at the rebound but makes a holy hash of it. Tevez is replaced by Kolarov.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> City have stepped back from this game a little bit in the last couple of minutes, letting Southampton have the ball. Eventually Lallana has to try and get past Zabaleta, though, and it's not happening. Sharp manages to find space to get a cross off, but it's hoofed clear. There are three added minutes for Southampton to find an equaliser.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>92 min</strong> Mancini orchestrated all this to prove a point to Ferguson.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Full time</strong> City end the game pinging one-touch passes around, but this has been a testing game for them - a second half that could as easily have gone awry as give the champions an opening victory. Nigel Adkins will be very pleased with Southampton's performance, and in particular the impact that his substitutes had. Mancini looks like his cookie has just sunk to the bottom a nice hot cup of earl grey, but he will take that. City looked very good, and the interplay between the front six was generally slick - Nasri, who was limping slightly at the end of the game, would be my player of the match. I'd best be off now. Thanks for joining me.</p>",
  "<p>Steve Kean got off lightly at Portman Road. Such was the din at Ipswich's late equaliser that any cries of \"Kean out\" from the 1,062 Blackburn fans went unheard. This was not an encouraging afternoon for the manager, supervising Rovers' first match outside the Premier League for 11 years. Though they led for an hour, they were never on top and increasingly pinned back by a midfield quartet of 19- to 21-year-olds. Paul Jewell of Ipswich could take greater heart from the 1-1 draw.</p> <p>\"Kean out\" has been a common refrain for most of the time since Kean has been in. In those 20 months the club have gone from Premier League comfort under Sam Allardyce to lower league crisis under Kean. As a coach his credentials are well proven. As a first-time manager he has come up short, which is no excuse for the level of abuse directed at him by fans. What some have condemned as arrogance others would commend as brave dignity in the face of deplorable behaviour.</p> <p>Kean's elevation raised eyebrows from the outset. He shared an agent, Jerome Anderson, with Venky's, Indian poultry giants who had bought the club the previous month. Venky's have come under similar fire, a secondary target to Kean, being more remote. Without them Rovers' fans might have been looking at another Portsmouth or Rangers. Such is gratitude.</p> <p>Contrary to terrace chants, Venky's do know what they are doing and will go on doing it. When doubts were cast in May, one of the chairperson Anuradha Desai's brothers said: \"Our entire family have fallen in love with the club. We cannot sell it.\" Last week the other confirmed the commitment as well as their experience of such investment and antagonism. He said in so many words that, when you have been confronted by 50,000 chicken farmers, what are 20,000 football fans? Those fans should be flattered that Venky's embrace Blackburn in a portfolio that includes the famous old Bombay Cricket Club and Sachin Tendulkar. Verbal terrorism will get them nowhere.</p> <p>The depth of disaffection is measurable. Season tickets sales are down from 15,000 to 7,000 and corporate clients from 250 to eight. The Prince's Trust, whom Venky's were proud to have as shirt sponsor, has pulled out, leaving those shirts as bare as they were when these sides last met on the first day 50 years ago, when Ipswich were champions and the score was 3-3.</p> <p>Though Venky's put Rovers on a stable financial footing and set up their challenge for a return to the Premier League, they have made a rod for their own back by poor communications. They crow not, neither do they cluck. They do things quietly and getting Ian Silvester, formerly at Liverpool, as football secretary and Derek Shaw from Preston as managing director promises well. Colin Hendry, too, a fans' favourite, has joined the coaching staff.</p> <p>But much pre-season good was undone when the club's new global adviser, Shebby Singh, a former Malaysian international, told supporters Kean would face the sack if Rovers lost three successive games and cast aspersions about Morten Gamst Pedersen, a veteran of eight years' service. An official club target followed Singh's: 16 points from the first seven games. That means five wins in six now. \"We have one goal: promotion,\" Kean said, adding with Churchillian gravity: \"It is our focus; it is our drive; it is our determination.\"</p> <p>One goal was all they got and not enough. Pedersen's corner was straight as a pensioner's stick, Scott Dann headed back and Colin Kazim-Richards headed in, both unmarked. Kazim-Richards might have settled matters before the hour but, running clear, he shot prodigally over to sustain Ipswich's hope in the heat as the new men from Fulham, Danny Murphy and Dickson Etuhu, tired and fell deeper. By the end Rovers, with Dann and Ga\u00ebl Givet showing Hendry-like last-ditch defiance, could be grateful not to have conceded more than Jason Lowe's own-goal.</p> <p>Kean felt \"the fans have seen a spirited, organised side\" and smilingly added, on inquiry, that his \"skin is quite thick\". Fans, whether they had seen it or not, resumed their electronic abuse. They may scrap for wish-bones but Venky's, not they, will see Kean out. And results will determine it.</p>",

It is make or break time for Somalia, long seen as the world's most failed state.</p> <p>At present, Mogadishu is dystopia. Countless buildings lie pulverised as if by an angry giant, evocative of the ruins of Europe at the end of the second world war. A lone staircase floats where a building used to be; a formerly grand hotel is now a skeleton stripped bare; a cathedral stands with no roof and broken masonry in the nave; a series of beachside bars and restaurants resemble ancient ruins. Few walls are free of bulletholes or cracked and crumbling plaster.

At a garage-cum-studio last week, their giant works were leaning against the walls. One diptych showed rodents with moneybags queuing up at \"the office of who you know\", then the happier scene of people with qualifications lining up at \"the office of what do you know\". A triptych portays a fallen young Somali rising from the ground and finally standing tall with the national flag.</p> <p>In the middle of the night, these works will be silently moved to prime locations in the city to make a public plea for justice, security and a national vision. The veteran artists are resurrecting a culture that was devastated 21 years ago when Somalia's government collapsed and warlords filled the vacuum.</p> <p>Ibrahim, 62, relaxing on a car seat on the floor (the car is long gone), learned to paint under an Italian mentor and was the official presidential portraitist. \"You had to try as much as possible to make him look more handsome and elegant,\" he recalled. \"You could not show his age.\"</p> <p>Hundreds of the portraits, and much of his other work, were lost in the chaos. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/31/shabaab-somalia-islamic-militia-refugees?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Then came al-Shabaab</a>, bringing a semblance of order and youth appeal (it runs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HSMPress\" title=\"\">a Twitter account</a>) but also a Taliban-like ban on TV, music, bras and depictions of humans and animals. These artists continued to draw in secret behind closed doors, however, and when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/somali-troops-mogadishu-rebels-out\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab was pushed out of Mogadishu by US-backed African Union forces</a> last year, the artists could return to the open. \"It was freedom for artists,\" Ibrahim said. \"We decided to work again.\"</p> <p>The old friends had been apart for years and were initially frightened of meeting again. They were helped by a parcel containing brushes, paints and other essential materials sent by a British benefactor. \"We were like children on Christmas day,\" said Adan Farah Affey, 50.</p> <p>The collective is now mentoring and teaching young people in a scheme run by Somalia's <a href=\"http://www.crdsomalia.org\" title=\"\">Centre for Research and Dialogue</a>. Affey hopes to develop Somalia's first ever art academy. Yet he used to be afraid of young people.</p> <p>\"Al-Shabaab used youth for recruitment,\" he added. \"A young guy can come and assassinate you. But I believe this project will stop them joining al-Shabaab because artists need to concentrate. It teaches them a way of life. If you are an artist, you need to be gentle and wise. You cannot kill yourself.\"</p> <p>Among the students is Suleyman Mohamed Yusuf, 20, who previously spent two years in a militia, collecting money at checkpoints and witnessing the killings of car passengers including children. \"At the checkpoint people were afraid of me,\" he recalled. \"You have a gun and you have the power. At that time I behaved as if I was the most powerful man in the city \u2013 I could capture the city.</p> <p>\"But I don't miss it because it was the wrong way because either you kill or be killed. Neither has any benefit for you. I've seen many troubles and I do not want to see them again.\"</p> <p>Describing the artists, Yusuf added: \"These are the only guys I admire. I've never seen people like this.\"</p> <p>The Centre, a thinktank working for reconciliation, is headed by Jabril Ibrahim Abdulle, 42, who lost his entire family in the civil war. It is running other youth projects including a My Mogadishu photography group \u2013 \"instead of shooting an AK47, they shoot a camera\" \u2013 a system for awarding grants and even a Somali Idols talent contest.</p> <p>Jabril Abdulle argues that young people, who make up the majority of the population, will decide Somalia's fate. \"The new constitution doesn't mention youth. There's no one consulting them. That's why al-Shabaab happened: they even took the name 'youth' [shabaab]. They did what the government is supposed to do in terms of reaching young people. They recruited people from the diaspora via Facebook to come and blow themselves up. It was a silent killer and no one was paying attention.\"</p> <p>Jabril Abdulle reckons there have been \"four or five\" assassination attempts against him. He was at the national theatre <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/04/somalia-theatre-suicide-bombing-shabaab\" title=\"\">when a suicide bomber struck earlier this year</a>; giving up his seat to elders, until he was at the end of the row, saved his life. He speaks to the Guardian a day after the director of the international airport was gunned down on his way to breakfast.</p> <p>Yet the defeat of al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, and the peace \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/02/somali-comic-marshale-death-threat\" title=\"\">a relative term</a> \u2013 that has followed, offer a sliver of hope.

The city hums with crammed minibus taxis, land cruisers with darkened windows and saloon cars that have seen better days \u2013 a bustle unthinkable amid the bullets and mortars just a year ago.</p> <p>\"For the first time in Somalia, something is happening,\" Jabril Abdulle said. \"People are saying we shall not rely on the government; what you see in Mogadishu is nothing to do with the government. People are saying enough is enough. About 150 buildings here are being renovated. Al-Shabaab will be defeated by the will and aspirations of the Somali people. They are really ready to move on.\"</p> <p>He estimates that 4,000-5,000 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19254249\" title=\"\">members of the Somalia diaspora</a> have been coming and going in the past three months, some bringing their children for the first time. But scarred by false dawns of the past, Jabril Abdulle warned: \"Something good is happening and I am scared. I don't want to lose it. We are on the edge. I can't say we're at a tipping point; we're at a pre-tipping point.\"</p> <p>The biggest hope, but also the biggest risk, comes on Monday when the weak transitional federal government is replaced by a president, prime minister, speaker and MPs elected by clan elders (Somalia is far from ready for a truly democratic election). The UN has already warned that the process is steeped in corruption; a parliamentary seat can reportedly be bought for $50,000 (\u00a331,832). Jabril Abdulle is wary of the fallout.</p> <p>\"You will have a lot of bad losers,\" he warned. \"They might not walk away. They might say, 'If I lose, everyone has to lose.' Somalia does not have a democratic tradition. There is a window of opportunity to engage the youth, but the possibility of returning to war is there. The value of an AK47 hasn't really gone down.\"</p> <p>The result could be a melee of warlords competing for power redolent of Afghanistan. Already, some say, there is an increase of checkpoints in Mogadishu in the absence of African Union forces, who are pursuing the battle with al-Shabaab elsewhere. Two militia groups are said to be competing for the spoils if and when al-Shabaab is driven out of its stronghold, the port city of Kismayu. Some analysts believe the writing is on the wall.</p> <p>One said: \"My feeling about the transition is that it's quite a lot of hot air and there are really significant challenges in the next six months. Poor Ugandans in the African Union forces are getting killed to create space for something but nobody's sure what it is.</p> <p>\"There's a danger it's going to give power to the people who were in control before 2006 and made Somalia a really shitty place. The rhetoric is that something new and beautiful is being built, but I'm not sure I believe it.\"</p>",
  "<p>I've always considered myself belonging to the school of writers who should be read but not heard, so I don't know what set of circumstances leads me to be standing here today. I suppose the subject matter, a national literature, is a compelling one for me, given the current political situation in these islands with the forthcoming independence referendum, and the fact that I'm now in genuine exile in the US, rather than a half-arsed one in London or Dublin.</p> <p>It only really hits you living outside the UK, how much the casual remark \"I'm Scottish\" or \"I'm British\" is, bizarrely, such a political statement. I speak as someone who has been described over the years in British Council, and other, literature as both. My friend Phillip Kerr and I find it amusing how I can be described as 'Scottish' while he's referred to as 'British' in the same festival brochure, as we grew up about three miles from each other in Edinburgh, and both left that city in our teens, to go to London. This, like so many things, is down to perceived social class differences. I don't want to get sidetracked by dwelling on class; at this stage let's just acknowledge the fundamental veracity of its relevance to this debate, and leave it at that.</p> <p>As this discussion originated in Edinburgh half a century ago, I'm going to focus mainly on the Scottish situation, as it's a pretty unique one. For we live in a country that isn't a nation, but has been lurching, almost apologetically at times, towards that status, picking up some of the trappings of such an entity en route. But, lest we forget, this is still a region of the UK.</p> <p>The political and cultural landscape was unrecognisable 50 years ago, when Hugh MacDiarmid delivered his lecture on a 'national literature', provoking <a href=\"http://www.chapman-pub.co.uk/magazine_details_083.php\">his famous spat with Alexander Trocchi</a>. We'd come through the horrors of war and holocaust, and people who regarded themselves as progressive politically saw internationalism as unambiguously good and desirable. It was forward-looking and inclusive, respecting the culture and aspirations of all, and based on fraternal, even socialistic notions. Nationalism, even dressed up in 'national liberation' clothes, was seen as morally dubious and inherently divisive.</p> <p>Now the dominant model of 'internationalism' is capitalist- and media-led globalization, levelling national and regional differences into a monolith of confused, debt-fuelled consumerism and bland, disposable culture. Today it's difficult to imagine, even without underestimating the formidable power of Scottish contrariness, that kind of discord existing between such freethinking mavericks as Trocchi and MacDiarmid. I'm quite sure that both, whether their vantage was the Scottish borders or New York City, would look at the UK in a globalized world and acknowledge that there were bigger fish to fry.</p> <p>As both a nation and a national culture, it's important to remember that the UK ascended on the back of the first imperialist epoch of globalization, when world markets were dominated by militaristic nation states. Paradoxically, the current era of globalization has, in some ways, strained the relationship between a national-cultural identity and a nation state, which, certainly in Britain, is starting to disappear. Rearguard actions by the establishment to promote a mono-cultural British nationalism are usually unable to move beyond the traditional bedrock of that nationalism; what Stuart Hall calls \"the idea of an assumed Englishness\", which has always negotiated against difference. This negotiation against difference is mirrored by the current mass production and dissemination of culture, whereby overt regional and national differences in this context, are in the first instance, perceived as troublesome barriers to mass sales.</p> <p>We can spend all day debating what is national and regional literature to the point where it becomes meaningless. In an American context, look at Wikipedia, and you'll find <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Literary_Regionalism\">writers as diverse as Steven King, John Steinbeck, Mark Twain, William Faulkner and Raymond Chandler all described as 'regional'</a>. The criterion for being a 'national' writer often seems to be as trite as living close enough to Manhattan to be able to attend the occasional <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/\">New Yorker</a> cocktail party.</p> <p>Global mass culture is now largely governed by an increasingly image-dominant, rather than linguistic-dominant, means of cultural production. Therefore, it's more difficult for it to be limited by national boundaries. In such an environment, the main question for storytellers who see themselves as working outside the global cultural highway of London, New York and LA is, what kind of room for manoeuvre do we have, in a global literary marketplace, to express national or regional culture? Moreover, can writing still be undertaken - and indeed, writers be formed - within a 'national' culture?</p> <p>The Scottish experience says a resounding 'yes' to this. Prominent novels that have come out this year, from Alan Warner, James Kelman, Jenni Fagan and, less obviously but still emphatically, Ewan Morrison, John Niven and Dougie Johnstone, clearly could not have been written by non-Scots. Even genre fiction writers, often derided as writing into marketing holes, must convey a sense of place, and perhaps even of national character or archetypes.</p> <p>Yet, Scottish fiction has an uneasy relationship in the 'British' literary paradigm, dominated by this imperialistic idea of an assumed Englishness, which, as Hall reminds us, exists to negotiate against difference. Only one Scottish novel has won the highly imperialist-orientated Man Booker Prize, routinely chosen by a largely upper middle-class English panel, and alternating around 50-50 between largely upper-middle-class English writers and citizens of the former colonies, presumably to stamp legitimacy on this 'global accolade'. Kevin Williamson of Rebel Ink, and Scottish Writer of the Year Alan Bissett, both recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jul/27/booker-prize-bias-english\">attacked the anti-Scottish discriminatory nature of the prize</a>, producing <a href=\"http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2012/07/26/the-man-booker-prize-44-years-of-institutionalised-anti-scottish-racism/\">hard, sobering statistics in support of their arguments</a>. That they haven't been deemed worthy of a reply can only be due to either the arrogance of hierarchical power, this negotiation against difference, or in this case, more likely, that the Booker apologists simply have no arguments to refute these observations. Hegemony not only breeds arrogance; it also promotes intellectual enfeeblement. The Booker prize's contention to be an inclusive, non-discriminatory award could be demolished by anybody with even a rudimentary grasp of six-form sociology. The academics who are custodians of the prize however, can only offer bland and complacent corporate PR speak in defence of an award based on the conceit that upper-class Englishness is the cultural yardstick against which all literature must be measured.</p> <p>The key point is that competing groups, ranging from national politicians to nongovernmental organisations to indigenous activists, have come to see culture as a valuable resource to be invested in, contested, and used for varied sociopolitical and economic ends. This idea has largely been expressed on the left \u2013 both traditional and modern - in terms of the <a href=\"http://faculty.washington.edu/mlg/courses/definitions/hegemony.html\">Gramscian notion of cultural struggle for hegemony</a>. Now, everything from the Jubilee to the Olympics, to all of us sitting here, illustrates that cultural agency, at every level, is negotiated within globalized contexts; dominated by the active management and administration not only of culture, but the circumstances within which it develops. In most cases, this is seen as a legitimate, even essential mode of urban development. So these rituals and everyday aesthetic practices are mobilized to promote tourism and the heritage business, in countries where mass culture-reliant industries often comprise significant portions of the GNP.</p> <p>Writers such as <a href=\"http://www.terminalconvention.com/symposium/participants/28/george-ydice/\">George Y\u00fadice</a> assert that a new international division of cultural labour has emerged, combining local difference with transnational administration and investment. Y\u00fadice contends this doesn't mean that today's increasingly transnational culture - exemplified by the entertainment industries and the so-called global civil society of nongovernmental organisations - is necessarily homogenized. In other words, no matter how strong economic and cultural hegemony is, there is always room for maverick opposition. The biggest shock about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/27/london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony-live\">2012 London Olympic opening ceremony</a> was that after 30-odd years of neo-liberal governments, such a genuinely anti-imperialist, multi-and-popular cultural event could actually take place in contemporary Britain.</p> <p>So national and regional differences still function, and shape the meaning of cultural and political phenomena, from pop songs to antiracist activism. Y\u00fadice considers a range of sites where identity politics and cultural agency are negotiated in the face of powerful transnational forces. For example he analyses appropriations of American funk music, and a citizen action initiative in Rio de Janeiro, to show how global notions such as cultural difference are deployed within specific social fields. He provides a political and cultural economy of a vast and increasingly influential art event \u2014 the insite triennial festival, which extends from San Diego to Tijuana. He posits on the uses of culture in an unstable world where censorship and terrorist acts can interrupt the usual channels of capitalist and artistic flows.</p> <p>With that point in mind, I'm only digressing slightly when I focus on a piece of work, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781908885012/tales-from-the-mall\">Tales From The Mall</a>, by Glasgow-based writer Ewan Morrison, which was published this year by Scotland's innovative <a href=\"http://www.cargopublishing.com/\">Cargo Press</a>. In the simplistic nature of market classification, this book is hard to tritely define (and therefore stock). Not only does it not fit the genre-dominated fiction boxes into which everything must increasingly be shoehorned, (again, retail-, not publishing- or artist-led), but it's not a fictional novel, short story collection, multi-media experience, or a treatise on modern architecture, consumer capitalism, authority structures and the negation of democracy, yet it's all of these things.</p> <p>Tales From The Mall, therefore, has gained little exposure, other than a fantastic word-of-mouth through the cognoscenti. This publication posits an exciting future for storytelling, from the so-called margins. It's an innovative book that is set largely in Scotland, but which has a global reach, as this small country interfaces with a globalised consumerist culture to produce truly zeitgeist writing.</p> <p>But the supposed crisis of national culture and writing in our globalised world is, like most of our current ills, fundamentally a crisis of democracy. Faced by the seemingly impregnable forces of multi-national capital, imperialist structures and their slavish spokespersons, overloaded by impotent debate, people must have forums and space for dissent and positive resistance. I emphasize the 'positive' only because we must never forget that local ethnicities/nationalities can become as dangerous as 'nation-state' ones when they simply fear modernism to the extent that they retreat into national and defensive identities.</p> <p>As I know through my own experience, the market will always convert art and culture into mass entertainment. When my first novel sold 10,000 copies, I was a local hero. When it sold 100,000, people grew more dubious. At a million copies I was a sell-out, whoring out my culture for the entertainment of outsiders. Now \u2026 I can't even think about it. The point is, that many people locally felt an ownership of the book, and a pride in it. What was an affirmation, an attestation to a place, a way of life, a language, a class, a culture and an attitude, became seen as something else. Obviously, the book was the same; I hadn't changed a word of it. Let me make it clear that I'm not complaining about making money - any writer that does is either a liar or crazy - just stressing that the marketplace can force the writer into a set of relationships and perspectives they might not have recalled signing up for.</p> <p>So from an aspiring author's point of view, if you're from the so-called margins, do you play the current publishing game - eg shoehorn yourself into writing genre fiction, and 'work within the system', as the successful Scandinavian writers have done in crime fiction, effectively globally rebranding (at least in the eyes of outsiders) an entire genre - or do you exercise the freedom of the author and simply do what the fuck you feel like? I think I know what both Trocchi and MacDiarmid would do, but I'm suggesting that there is legitimacy, and not necessarily a dichotomy, in doing both. But wherever a writer, or their writing, is placed on the spectrum, what interests me, personally, is work which in some way, speaks the truth to power. To my mind this is still is the greatest freedom a writer can have. The celebrated, marvellous, Indian writer and political activist Arundhati Roy was reported to have said, \"it's alright speaking the truth to power, but just don't expect it to listen\". While I understand what she means, I don't think we speak the truth to power for power's ear, but for the ear and the imagination of future generations, who would seek to live in a world free from the malign and self-serving influence of those who wield it.</p> <p>So the call to arms is a twofold one: firstly, let's have a look around, it's a big world, and if bits of it move you, don't be afraid to write about it. Second, be bold, and proud of who are and where you come from. Express your culture, your concerns and those of your community and the voices within it, however movable a feast that is. Because if you don't, the chances are that it might not be around in the future. So do what Trocchi and MacDiarmid would do: don't get obsessed with histories and legacies or markets and 'rules', just hit those keys and see what happens.</p> <p>\u2022 The <a href=\"http://www.edinburghworldwritersconference.org/\">Edinburgh World Writers' conference</a>, hosted jointly by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/edinburgh-book-festival\">Edinburgh International Book festival</a> and the British Council, runs from 17-21 August, with contributions from Ali Smith, Irvinw Welsh, China Mi\u00e9ville and Patrick Ness</p>",
  "<p>The growing row over biofuels is ready to flare up again with German researchers claiming to have found evidence that European-produced biodiesel does not meet the sustainability targets claimed by Brussels.</p> <p>Two experts at Friedrich Schiller University in Jena say eight out of their 10 tests on locally produced rapeseed biodiesel failed to show the 35% greenhouse gas savings promised. In most cases it was under 30%. The use of biofuels would be further undermined when the EU emissions target increases, as planned, to 50% in five years' time.</p> <p>Gernot Pehnelt and Christoph Vietze also claim their work has been undermined by a lack of co-operation from the European Union which they believe is on the defensive over championing local energy crops.</p> <p>\"Our results indicate that the 'sustainability' of rapeseed biodiesel in the interpretation of the [EU's] renewable energy directive is at best questionable and in most scenarios simply unjustifiable,\" said Pehnelt. \"What we need is transparency. The European commission hesitates to publish all the background data and promises to come up with new calculations for individual biofuels but they have not come up with any values yet.\"</p> <p>Biofuels are accused by the UN and others of pushing up world food prices, and exacerbating the effect of the most severe drought in the US in half a century. US legislators called on the environmental protection agency this month to waive its ethanol mandate that stipulates 40% of the American corn crop is turned into biodiesel. The US department of agriculture said the corn yield would be the lowest for 17 years, raising grain prices as it means there will be more demand for wheat to be used as animal feed.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva, director general of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) at the United Nations, said he wanted to see a halt in US government-backed production of corn-based ethanol, which is mixed with petrol to make \"greener\" fuel, amid fears the world is heading for another food crisis like the one in 2008 that triggered riots.</p> <p>The EU's lack of transparency on biofuels has already been challenged by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Client Earth, and the German academics say their problems play into the hands of those who believe that Brussels is deliberately overstating the benefits of local rapeseed for political reasons.</p> <p>Germany, France and Italy are the EU's biggest producers of rapeseed oil, and are also home to a car manufacturing industry that actively supports the use of biodiesel for reducing carbon emissions.</p> <p>Europe's renewable energy directive, introduced three years ago, demands that greenhouse gas emissions from production and use of biofuels for transport must be at least 35% lower than those from fossil fuels. In 2017 that marker is meant to rise to 50%.</p> <p>Plans drawn up by EU member states predict that bio-energy, including biomass for power generation and biofuel for transport, will provide more than 50% of the EU share of renewable energy as part of 2020 climate goals.</p> <p>Use of biodiesel is expected to double by 2020 to 19.95m tonnes of oil equivalent from around 10m tonnes in 2010.</p> <p>Brussels faces a big challenge coming up with the investment and technology needed to move to a new feedstock for biodiesel, such as weeds and waste stems that would take the pressure off grain supplies for food.</p> <p>The EU also needs to find inputs that would no longer result in the clearing of environmentally sensitive forests and wetlands to plant fuel crops, an issue known as indirect land use change.</p> <p>The finds of the two German academics have received the support of Fausto Freire, who conducts research on biofuels at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. He told Nature magazine that there are \"huge uncertainties\" associated with the greenhouse-gas emissions of biodiesel but another academic, Gerhard Brankatschk at Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, believed the east German study had \"severe shortcomings\".</p> <h2>Nestl\u00e9: End biofuels now\"<br></h2> <p>The chairman of the world's biggest food group Nestl\u00e9, Peter Brabeck, has called on politicians to lobby to end the use of food in the production of biofuels.</p> <p>\"This does not mean that biofuel should be scrapped entirely but that producers should use other organic materials,\" Brabeck told the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung.</p> <p>He joins a growing chorus of politicians and scientists calling for a rethink in biofuel production.</p> <p>\"Our problem is that almost half of US corn production and 60% of European rape is being used for fuel production,\" he said.</p> <p>Biofuel production is adding pressure on food prices which are already being boosted by climate change.</p> <p>\"[Food] prices are increasingly prone to swings and correlate more and more with oil prices,\" he said.</p> <p>He also called for more transparency in international commodities markets.</p>",
  "<p>Monday marks a significant anniversary in recent economic history for it was on this day in 1982 that Mexico announced a moratorium on its international debts. The default marked the start of what became known as the third world debt crisis.</p> <p>Three decades later that crisis is now the first world debt crisis. For Mexico read Greece. For American, British and Japanese banks recycling the 1970s windfall profits of oil producers to sub-prime Latin American governments read US and European banks pumping out cheap credit to sub-prime mortgage holders. For the syndicated loans that allowed banks to lend recklessly without the necessary prudential checks read the securitisation of loans that allowed banks to bundle up the good mortgages with the bad and sell them.</p> <p>The policy response to the crisis has also been identical. In 1982, Latin American governments were lent money by the International Monetary Fund so that they could pay back the banks that were threatened with going bust as a result of their stupidity. As in Greece today, the money was given with one hand and taken away again with the other.</p> <p>Draconian conditions were imposed on these loans, which resulted in a lost decade of high unemployment, increased poverty and contracted output. In 1990, the output of Latin America was 8% smaller than it was in 1980. Governments paid a high price for their bailouts because the IMF was concerned that too soft an approach would lead to a problem of \"moral hazard\" \u2013 instead of learning from their mistakes, countries such as Mexico and Brazil could be encouraged to go on another borrowing binge.</p> <p>The debt burden on the affected countries did not go down as a result of this shock treatment; it went up. Mexico's debt to GDP ratio doubled in the five years after 1982 because its economy collapsed. Belatedly, there was a recognition at the IMF and in western capitals that the debts were unpayable and had to be written down. From small beginnings, the campaign for debt relief flourished in the 1990s, with its focus moving from Latin America to sub-Saharan Africa. Despite fears that debt amnesties rewarded bad behaviour, governments have \u2013 by and large \u2013 learned harsh lessons. Moral hazard has not been a problem.</p> <p>Except, of course, for the banks, who were treated with kid gloves following their excesses in the late 70s and early 80s. Far from tightening up regulation and supervision, governments in the west continued to dismantle controls. Controls on capital were abolished both within countries and across national borders. Measures put in place after the great depression to limit the size and the scope of banks were abolished. Banks became bigger, more powerful and extended their global reach. It was the heyday of financial liberalisation, and its architects insisted it would lead to more efficient use of capital, faster growth and greater prosperity for everyone.</p> <p>What financial liberalisation actually led to was a concentration of power exercised without restraint, the enrichment of a small elite, moral hazard on a colossal scale and a series of crises that became ever more serious as they burrowed their way from the periphery of the global economy to its core.</p> <p>There are two obvious lessons for the present day from the Latin American debt disaster. The first is that there will be a further writedown of Greece's debts, either through a debt amnesty or through a default that may take place inside or outside the eurozone. Greece's economy is now around 20% smaller than it was three years ago, and that means the debt arithmetic does not add up.</p> <p>The second lesson is that leaving the financial system untouched, unreformed and unpunished almost guarantees another severe debt crisis. This might look unlikely at the moment because the banks are currently reluctant to lend, but sooner or later memories of past speculative excesses will fade, as they did after Dutch tulips, the South Sea bubble and the Wall Street crash.</p> <p>Can anything be done to prevent this happening? One thing that would help would be a rethink of the way economics is taught, since the messianic belief in abstract \u2013 and failed \u2013 models coupled with a complete absence of historical perspective increases the danger of mistakes being repeated.</p> <p>In a new collection of essays about the teaching of economics after the fall, the Bank of England's Andrew Haldane says the crisis was an analytical failure or intellectual virus. \"This virus had contaminated almost everyone by 2007, causing them to view the pre-crisis world through spectacles far rosier than subsequent events have shown was justified.\"</p> <p>There was no sense of the risks that were being run. On the contrary, it was assumed that the global economy had achieved a state of bliss, in which the models \"proved\" that all the big problems of the past had now been solved. Some basic knowledge of the teachings of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Friedrich Hayek and Maynard Keynes might have prevented the groupthink.</p> <p>Smith warned about the dangers of monopoly power, while Hayek said the price system would only work its magic if competition prevails. Marx said history was moving towards a system of monopoly capitalism, and Keynes said this was particularly dangerous when it took the form of financial speculation.</p> <p>All these great thinkers would have their own take on the crisis. Smith would want to see multinationals broken up, Hayek would be arguing that it would be better to allow banks to fail than to keep them in a zombie-like state, and Keynes would want to see finance become the servant of industry not its master.</p> <p>The Marxist perspective, exemplified in a new book by John Bellamy Foster and Robert McChesney, is also useful. This argues that the strong western growth rates in the middle of the 20th century were something of a mirage, caused by high military spending, postwar reconstruction, higher welfare spending and the investment in road networks that allowed the full flowering of the age of the automobile.</p> <p>Since then, a number of things have happened. There has been a concentration of capital but a shortage of profitable investment opportunities. So far, there has not been a wave of innovations like the car, the plane, cinema and TV to give the global economy a shot in the arm, although it is possible that digital, robotics, genetics and green technology could act as a catalyst. The result has been a declining trend rate of growth, and the increased financialisation of western economies as the surpluses have been re-cycled through the banks in a search for yield. Hence the Latin American debt crisis. Hence the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Hence the inability of the global economy to emerge from its torpor.</p> <p><em>\u2022 What's the Use of Economics; edited by Diane Coyle; published 15 September by London Publishing Partnership</em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Endless Crisis; John Bellamy Foster and Robert McChesney; Monthly Review Press; September 2012</em></p>",
  "<p>When Gail Collins stepped out in front of the deafening 80,000-strong crowd watching the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/27/london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony-live\" title=\"\">Olympics opening ceremony</a>, wearing a high-neck Edwardian blouse and the purple, white and green sash that marked her out as one of Danny Boyle's 50 suffragettes, she couldn't hear the noise, just the beating of her heart. \"It was one of the biggest days of my life,\" she said. \"Getting married, having my children and being in the opening ceremony. I felt proud, really proud that we had got there.\"</p> <p>In the months before the ceremony, the women forged a particular bond \u2013 with each other and the women they were representing. So when the experience ended, what did the Olympic suffragettes do? They kept marching.</p> <p>Dozens of suffragette performers, led by Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emmeline Pankhurst, plan to march on parliament, at the vanguard of a major feminist rally organised to urge MPs to stop \"eroding erosion of women's rights\" and make more progress on women's equality.</p> <p>Some of the suffragettes had no experience of campaigning and some younger cast members knew little about the women they were representing, but many now want to use the experience as a springboard into modern-day activism, starting with <a href=\"http://ukfeminista.org.uk/events/feminist-lobby-of-parliament/\" title=\"\">UK Feminista's rally</a> on 24&#xa0;October. \"Coming together was a gift and it would be such a wicked waste to not carry on and we can't let people down by not continuing,\" said 37-year-old Collins, a stay-at-home mother of two.</p> <p>No longer under the guidance of Boyle \u2013 who included the suffragette section in the ceremony after becoming enthralled by the memorial plaque to Emily Davison, found on the back of the broom cupboard door where she once hid in the House of Commons \u2013 the group may treat observers to a scaled-down version of their performance. It may even include the critical moment, which to the annoyance of many wasn't featured in the TV coverage, when the women formed a human scaffolding to carry a Christ-like Davison above their heads.</p> <p>Another suffragette, Lesley Covington, a 57-year-old who gave up her job as a designer 20 years ago to look after her children, had never thought of herself as a feminist activist. \"I'm not sure I would even now,\" she said. \"But why shouldn't we take this opportunity? Women are still under-represented in parliament and the upper echelons of business; childcare is a huge issue. I want to get involved and I&#xa0;want to make a difference. You can change things \u2013 you have to believe that, or you would never try.\"</p> <p>The opening ceremony and the Olympics as a whole, which involved women from every nation participating for the first time, as well as huge success for female athletes, could inspire many more women to campaign for gender equality, said Pankhurst, an ambassador for the global anti-poverty charity <a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Care International</a>.</p> <p>\"When we see things like women's boxing it is important, because it starts to shift perception about what women should and shouldn't do. The Olympics is a real platform to make it more than just symbols and this rally is really building on that.\"</p> <p>While Pankhurst said political struggle was \"in her veins\", other women in the group had become \"interested in the issues as well as the fun\", after keeping in touch via Facebook. \"Modern technology is allowing us to organise as suffragettes much easier than they did in the past \u2013 it unlocks the potential,\" she said. \"Until we are on an equal footing and [while] unnecessary problems remain there will continue to be a need to speak out.\"</p> <p>The suffragettes \u2013 who hope to track down Edwardian costumes for the rally \u2013 will join a broad coalition of groups that includes the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/10/frances-ogrady-tuc-general-secretary\" title=\"\">TUC deputy general secretary, Frances O'Grady,</a> and the director of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, and organisations including the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Fawcett Society</a>, <a href=\"http://www.southallblacksisters.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Southall Black Sisters</a> and the anti-objectification group <a href=\"http://www.object.org.uk/about-us\" title=\"\">Object</a>.</p> <p>Many protesters are requesting meetings with their MPs, while others will remain outside parliament to highlight issues such as a lack of progress on tackling violence against women, and making more women visible in parliament and in business. Other demands include measures to tackle the objectification of women \u2013 also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/24/leveson-inquiry-sexualised-images-ban\" title=\"\">put to Lord Justice Leveson</a> during his inquiry into the ethics of the media \u2013 childcare and the protection of Sure Start centres, justice for female asylum-seekers and the protection of women's reproductive rights.</p> <p>\"The time is right for this. There is anger, injustice and potential, and that all comes together in 2012,\" said Chakrabarti.</p> <p>Britain is witnessing a resurgence of feminist activism as hard-won rights come under threat, said Kat Banyard, the founder of UK Feminista.</p> <p>\"Too often, issues relating to women's inequality are put to one side and seen as an add-on, but tackling this injustice is absolutely central to building a good society.</p> <p>\"People are sick of the attacks on women's rights and are fighting back. At the lobby, women and men from across the country will be making it clear to their MP that we can't go on like this, it's time to move forward.\"</p> <p>For Collins, taking part in the opening ceremony has given her a voice, and she is determined to use it.</p> <p>\"It's not fashionable to say you are a feminist, but women need to stand up,\" she said. \"I've always had these beliefs but this has pushed me to do something about it. It just feels like I'm not on my own.\"</p>",
  "<p>I should be thinking about tigers, or organ theft, or environmental mayhem. I'm at a book festival, and all those are in my next novel \u2013 a novel I'm so desperate to get back to that I can barely see straight. </p> <p>Instead, I keep returning to a sort of family tree.</p> <p>It begins with the American dream, a promise of moderate prosperity: a detached house in the suburbs with a white picket fence, a stately family car in the drive. It's the promise at the root not only of the US self-perception, but of every modern capitalist democracy \u2013 not a job for life, but a life made good by a job. But it has been suspect for much of the last hundred years \u2013 Steinbeck's Of Mice And Men is about the hollowness of the hope in the time of the Great Depression. The second world war didn't help. Then the space race of the 60s and 70s revived the premise; Nasa commissioned a series of artists' impressions, essentially <a href=\"http://images.businessweek.com/ss/10/03/0302_affordable_suburbs/4.htm\">Cave Creek, Arizona</a>, but in orbit \u2013 replacing the westward expansion of the early US with an outward one into the wider solar system. The idea of space colonisation coincides, also, with the arrival of environmentalism in the form of the Gaia hypothesis, and boundaries to capitalism in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth\">The Limits to Growth</a>. It's a way of avoiding the acknowledgement of a world of finite resources and the corollary that wealth is a zero sum game: if you own X, that means I don't.</p> <p>The original dream was replaced, ultimately, by the lottery win: the perfect story of being discovered, of a natural talent shining through a TV screen or down from a stage, inspiring worship and wealth. But the truth of the lottery win is hard, even as the fantasy is outrageous: it probably won't happen to you. It relies not entirely on talent, nor on hard work. It happens when your ship comes in. And again, the lottery win denies the solid, simple, common-sense wisdom on which I was raised, but which now seems almost Dickensian: the acknowledgement that there's no such thing as a free lunch. Everything is paid for in the end.</p> <p>That truth is the inconvenient one, both to politicians who must pledge obvious impossibilities in the popularity contest of election, and corporations, who have learned that the simplest way to sell something is to claim that it costs nothing. Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, our financial industry and governments leaned on a snake oil mirage of wealth creation, a bubble predicated on the obvious falsehood that things could only get better. The digital rhetoric of a nascent internet played its part, too: a consequence-free environment where creative works could be endlessly duplicated, identity was malleable, and discussion was unregulatable. The digital cost is still being counted, though I suspect it will ultimately be lower than the gain. The larger mirage was revealed for what it was in the collapse of its most extreme example: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">sub-prime mortgages which were never intended to be repaid</a>, were in fact to all intents and purposes unrepayable, but which were created to be sold on, a toxic future which inevitably poisoned the financial waters when the bill came due.</p> <p>The law of conservation of energy applies. Nothing is without consequence. In abandoning the understanding that things \u2013 services, goods, wars and houses \u2013 have costs, we risk becoming infantilised, incapable of making decisions about government or finance, and perhaps above all about the environment, the wellbeing of the planet upon which we depend and which our children will inherit from us. It's convenient to those above us, and messily injurious to us and our future. The free lunch is a bad idea, and we need to rid ourselves of it, to take back our understanding of consequence and worth, and demand to see the numbers so we know what we're getting into.</p> <p>And having said that aloud, perhaps I can go back to my book.</p> <p><strong>Nick Harkaway is discussing The Blind Giant and his latest novel, Angelmaker at the Edinburgh International Book Festival<br></strong></p>",
  "<p>My entry into teaching wasn't really typical. It was a meandering journey, I guess. I loved primary school, I had a lovely time there. It was a small, Welsh rural primary where Welsh was the first language and I just remember how fantastic the teachers were. In fact Mr Davies, who I had in year 5 was a particular inspiration to me. I can remember having him again in year 6 and being so chuffed. He was my first male teacher and he was young and more relaxed than the other teachers and quite cool. He enjoyed teaching and he had a laugh with us and that promoted a really relaxed atmosphere in the class.</p> <p>Even when I went onto secondary school I still gravitated back to my primary school. My gran, who had been a reception teacher, could see the potential in me to teach, she always said I was the first to get a game going on the playground and to get stuck in. She recognised the signs.</p> <p>But the idea of teaching went off my radar at secondary. I got into PE and science, in particular I loved rugby and biology and so I went off to study sports conditioning and coaching at Hartbury College (UWE) in Gloucester and then did my MA in sports and exercise science.</p> <p>It was only when I went on a year out to stay in Spain with family and I volunteered to be a teaching assistant at an international school that the idea of teaching reappeared on the horizon for me. I got to teach and coach a lot of the sports and realised I had a real passion for learning.</p> <p>My PGCE was one of the most intense years of my life - my MA was intense but the PGCE was totally flat out. I had to adapt my life. Also, I didn't have a television. I had really got into reading while I was in Spain and so I used my evenings to read up on teaching and around the subject. Although it was flat out, I figured it was just one year of my life and I know if it had been three years I wouldn't have got through it. My sports degree had allowed me to get all the mucking around out of my system and I am so glad of that.</p> <p>Finding a job afterwards was tough. There were around 150-160 applicants for each place. I remember the interview for my first school and being invited to have lunch with the governors and being told to \"eat up.\" I was so nervous I thought: \"The last thing I want to do is eat.\" But I got the job and it gave me so many opportunities.</p> <p>The deputy head Alex Smith showed me so much and really taught me how to interact with the children; how to focus on the positive things and create great learning opportunities for them. He's been a key influence for me. I moved around a lot that first year, floating into all classes and teaching all subjects which was good as I saw myself firmly as a key stage 2 teacher but I learnt how to interact with all ages.</p> <p>I know it's a cliche, but I really wanted to teach to make a really significant difference and I just love watching the change in the pupils over the year, you watch them grow in confidence and self belief and all I want is to give them that because it is the biggest catalyst for getting them to learn and grow. I want to bring out the best in them. Teaching is first and foremost a relationship game and you need to get inside their heads and help them to feel positive about themselves and the rest - the good grades and good behaviour - will come. Developing a relationship with those kids is the absolute key.</p> <p>We've got a thriving gardening club at school which I started - all the classes have raised beds and we grow lettuces, leeks, parsnips, beetroots, onions, sprouts, broccoli. But in many ways that's how I see teaching - like a garden. I want my classroom to be the place where the pupils can flourish and grow. The educationalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(educationalist)\">Ken Robinson</a> talks about this tendancy for modern teaching to be this standardised, mechanised, sanitised thing like fast food but really the most successful method is the agricultural method where you plant the seeds, give them the right care and attention and conditions and they grow. It's not so much a linear process but an organic one. That's what I am trying to do.</p> <p>I love poking my head out of the door at break and seeing this army of children going backwards and forwards to the water butts, watering all the plants and looking after them. For some children who may not be academic or sporting, it can be really empowering to have grown food from seed. And then we had a big <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterChef_%28UK_TV_series%29\">Masterchef</a> competition this year so the children all had to come up with the idea for a three course meal that was healthy and tasty - we also do big cookery demos with the food. Hopefully, the gardening and cooking is something they will continue to do for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Going into teaching was the best decision I made but it really is not a job, it is a way of life. I know it's exhausting and I know I will probably shave off a few years of my life in doing it but every day I know that I am not lining someone else's pocket, I am making a difference.</p> <p>For those starting out in teaching I would say four things:</p> <p>\u2022 Be prepared: If you are doing a PGCE then be ready for a year of dedicated work. That year is the business and it is tough, but try and see everything as an opportunity. Even when there are things you have to do that you might question the value of (such as having perfect looking lesson plans and meticulous folders) just do the things the way the teacher/tutor wants you to.<br>\u2022 Get stuck in; Take opportunities and make opportunities. If you get chance to run a club or help out with one do it. You have the chance to leave a legacy even if you are at the school for six weeks make sure people remember and enjoy what you have brought to their school.<br>\u2022 Develop high quality relationships with students: Once you get those in place you can tailor everything else around them. Get to know about their hobbies, their friends, their likes and dislikes and their families. You don't have to be harsh or nasty to get good behaviour; have a calm environment and a calm considered approach.<br>\u2022 Praise: Look actively for chances to praise children and if a child is showing an odd behaviour then don't react emotionally, step back and try and look for why that child is behaving differently. Ask yourself if they are tired or if something has happened at home. Take time to speak to the child and be on their side, let them know they can trust you. Each child is different but if you take time to build a relationship with them the rest will fall into place.</p> <p><em>Adam Lopez previously worked at Langstone Primary School, Newport, South Wales and is starting a new post in September at a primary school in West Wales.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.
