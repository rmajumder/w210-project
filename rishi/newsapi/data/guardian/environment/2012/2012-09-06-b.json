If the Greens have such good policies \"covering everything from health to housing; the economy to education and pensions\", publicise them, or you'll sound like Labour, where the silence is deafening.

  "<p>Nicholas Lewis (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/antarctic-climate?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 28 August) complained that your report (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/23/arctic-sea-ice-record-low?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Arctic ice melt likely to break record</a>, 24 August) gave the impression that typical temperatures in Antarctica have risen as much as on the Antarctic peninsula. While he is correct about this, his letter also refers to an outdated study of his, which argued that previous estimates of overall Antarctic warming were too high. In fact, the work of Lewis and co-authors has been proven wrong.</p> <p>The relevant paper here is Orsi et al, <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL051260.shtml\" title=\"\">Geophysical Research Letters, vol. 39, 2012</a>, which shows that the rate of warming in west Antarctica is as great, or greater, than what we showed in our original work (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7414/full/nature11483.html\" title=\"\">Steig et al</a>, Nature, vol. 457, 2009). Moreover, Lewis's own paper shows there has been significant warming in west Antarctica and that the average trend over Antarctica is of warming, not cooling as is often stated.</p> <p>The reality is that the Antarctic is warming up and is contributing significantly to sea level rise; and that there is strong potential for a greater contribution to sea level rise from Antarctica in the future. <br><a href=\"http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/~steig/\" title=\"\"><strong>Professor Eric Steig</strong></a><br><em>University of Washington, Seattle, USA</em></p> <p>\u2022 Even as scientists report a record Arctic ice melt \u2013 indicating that man-made climate change is progressing at a faster pace than had been anticipated \u2013 the coalition continues to signal its readiness to spend taxpayers' money, no matter how harmful or ineffective (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/heathrow-battle-third-runway-ministers?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Heathrow runway row</a>, 5 September). And it's not just Heathrow.

  "<p>Your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/02/housing-crisis-home-economics-editorial\" title=\"\">editorial on housing</a> (3 September) is unduly pessimistic in suggesting there is no route out of the crisis. The three elements essential to recovery are: first, the restoration of wider economic confidence; second, a resumption of mortgage lending; and, third, a renewed programme of public investment. It is oversimplistic to claim that a generation have been priced out of home ownership. The costs of servicing a loan today are lower in relation to average earnings than at any time over the past decade. It is the highly restrictive lending policies operated by the banks that are the obstacle. As a consequence, many more people are renting privately, even though the costs are in many cases higher than servicing a mortgage.</p> <p>The problem of access is even worse for those on low incomes because of the savage 60% cut made by the government in the affordable housing budget and the consequent collapse in the social housing programme. A clear government commitment to increase access to both home-ownership and social renting would make a significant impact on housing prospects and help to restore confidence. You are right, however, to be sceptical about the supposed benefits of relaxing planning rules. This is a complete red herring. Six years ago under the previous government's planning policy, and before the credit crunch, almost twice as many new homes were being started as today.<br><a href=\"http://www.nickraynsford.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Nick Raynsford MP</strong></a><br><em>Lab, Woolwich </em></p> <p>\u2022 Despite hand-wringing from the liberal left, the government is right to look at reducing the burden of affordable housing provision to help kickstart stalled projects (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/06/cameron-clegg-unveil-planning-reforms?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 6 September). But this does not address the fact that we have a flawed approach to social housing. Britain's social housing sector is one of the largest in Europe, accounting for up to one-fifth of the total. In Germany, a nation of stable prices and low rents, it's 5%. But even if the financial barriers to development are lifted, we still have far too many barriers to building new homes. This is not about allowing our green and pleasant land to be concreted over, although less than 10% of England's surface area is actually developed, but allowing sustainable development to provide the homes and jobs this country desperately needs.</p> <p>Never in its 25-year-history has my company been forced to take so many planning applications to appeal, most of which relate to sites on brownfield land. I attribute this to the uncertainty created by constant tinkering at the edges of planning policy, and the fact that far too many local authorities block development for short-term political reasons. What we need is bold and decisive action. Without a complete overhaul of our dysfunctional planning system, these latest initiatives will fail to make a jot of difference. <br><strong>Bob Weston </strong><br><em>Chairman and Managing Director, </em><a href=\"http://www.weston-homes.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Weston Homes</em></a><em> </em></p> <p>\u2022 Before the green belt is attacked two other avenues need to be explored: derelict and empty houses, and the height to which developers are permitted to build. The first can be dealt with easily \u2013 double council tax on empty properties, with&#xa0;compulsory purchase by local councils if this isn't paid. The second requires imagination. I live in a two-storey development of flats. It could easily have been four or six storeys, with no detriment to the local environment. In London, people live quite happily in tall blocks, that make good use of the land, and leave enough land unspoilt for gardens and parks. Most of us would rather live in a flat we can afford, than envy a semi-detached house with a garden that we can't.<br><strong>Rev Richard Haggis</strong><br><em>Oxford </em></p>",
  "<p>\u2022 The presidential candidates' main challenge, in the country at large, is persuading a largely uninterested electorate to pay attention in the first place \u2013 and a forthcoming book by Bob Woodward hardly bodes well for Barack Obama in this regard. In The Price of Politics, Woodward recounts the day when senior Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid were scrambling to finalise the details of the stimulus bill. The president, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bob-woodward-book-debt-deal-collapse-led-pure/story?id=17104635&amp;singlePage=true#.UEjfi3DKM48\">ABC reports</a>, phoned in to deliver a \"high-minded message\". He kept talking. And talking. And talking. Eventually, Pelosi \"reached over and pressed the mute button on her phone\", so the two could continue working as Obama lectured on. And that was within Obama's first few weeks as president; these days, presumably, she just lets him go straight to voicemail.</p> <p>\u2022 Bill Clinton's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton-endorsement-barack-obama\">Wednesday night convention speech</a>, commentators almost universally agreed, was a triumph. Among the few disappointed voices was that of FactCheck.org, a non-partisan project set up to monitor both campaigns' truth levels. The Clinton speech was <a href=\"http://factcheck.org/2012/09/our-clinton-nightmare/\">\"a fact-checker's nightmare\"</a>, their operatives reported, because he included so many \"statistics and factual claims\" \u2013 almost all of which \"checked out\". This feels like a watershed moment of sorts: is lying now so endemic in US politics that a speech <em>not</em> full of juicy untruths counts as a disappointment? Perhaps FactCheck should turn to the question, hotly disputed among pundits, of whether Clinton's performance was a \"barn-raiser\", a \"barnstormer\" or a \"stemwinder\". (Note to less accomplished speechmakers than Clinton, which means everybody: don't try to raise a barn and storm it simultaneously, for health and safety reasons.)</p> <p>\u2022 And why wasn't Hillary Clinton in Charlotte to watch her husband? On the right, speculation was rampant. Was she \"avoiding\" the convention, as <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/avoiding-dnc-hillary-clinton-gets-snubbed-in-china/article/2507027#.UEi6-nDKM48\">the Washington Examiner claimed</a>? Did her trip to East Timor \"forcefully [underline] her effort to distance herself from Obama's waning political fortunes\", <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/29/hillary-clinton-to-leave-the-hemisphere-during-democratic-convention/\">as the Daily Caller put it</a>? Does she find Bill intolerable? Perhaps! Then again, the real reason just might have been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/05/politics/dnc-no-hillary/index.html\">the Hatch Act of 1939</a>, which specifically outlaws the presence of secretaries of state at conventions, so that the nation's chief representative abroad remains non-political. Secretary Clinton watched Bill's speech on a computer in the Timorese ambassador's home, and in the <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5940926/heres-a-very-cute-photo-of-hillary-clinton-watching-bills-speech\">State Department's official photo</a>, she looks thrilled, not reluctant. Although, that said, there's what appears to be a stiff alcoholic drink within arm's reach, so maybe that helped.</p> <p>\u2022 For several months, thanks to a public art project, walkers on a hiking trail near Glendale in California have come face to face with cardboard cutouts of Hollywood's western heroes: Clint Eastwood, John Wayne and Gene Autry.

  "<p>The arrival in cinemas today&#xa0;of the period drama Anna Karenina marks the end of the summer blockbuster season \u2013 that annual orgy of expensive, CGI-heavy motion pictures. The Hollywood studios long ago started preparing their basket of treats for next summer, but that won't stop them trying to make sense of what just happened: what worked, what didn't, and what lessons can be learned.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Superheroes</strong></h2> <p>Audience affection for comic-book crime fighters is nothing new, but the genre's dominance in summer 2012 reached new heights, providing three of the top-five UK box-office hits. That's a big step up from summer 2011, when X-Men: First Class, Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor all failed to crack the summer top 10. Warner Bros will be pleased that, in the UK at least, The Dark Knight Rises out-grossed its predecessor (in the US, it is still $100m behind), and Sony will be happy with the performance of its Spider-Man reboot. Top prize, however, goes to Disney and Marvel: their Avengers Assemble augurs well for the seemingly endless stream of Marvel movies on their way.</p> <h2><strong>Loser: Dance flicks</strong></h2> <p>When StreetDance 2 sputtered to just \u00a33.1m at the UK box-office \u2013 a steep, steep fall from StreetDance's \u00a311.6m \u2013 commentators wondered whether it signalled the end for the genre, or was just a blip. An even worse performance for Step Up 4: Miami Heat a couple of months later \u2013 \u00a32.6m, down from a franchise high of \u00a310.6m with Step Up 2 the Streets \u2013 suggests it really is all over for PG-rated romances populated by plucky, sportswear-attired youngsters acrobatically battling for ego, honour and sheer anti-establishment joie-de-vivre.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Channing Tatum</strong></h2> <p>While Step Up faltered, the franchise's&#xa0;original male star soared to&#xa0;new heights. Magic Mike's $113m US&#xa0;box-office success in June meant that Tatum had delivered three consecutive $100m-plus grosses in the&#xa0;US in less than six months \u2013 following The Vow ($125m) and 21 Jump Street ($138m).</p> <h2><strong> Loser: Dr Seuss</strong></h2> <p>In America, they love Theodor Seuss Geisel, and every child seems to know all about the Grinch, the Cat in the Hat and the Hortons of Whoville. Over here, not so much. While Dr Seuss' The Lorax grossed a decent $214m Stateside, in the UK it has struggled, with \u00a37.3m so far. It didn't even match the UK box-office for Horton Hears a Who (\u00a38.7m), considered at the time to be a disappointment.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Original stories</strong></h2> <p>Yes, of course the summer box-office chart is dominated by sequels and films based on what Hollywood rejoices in calling \"existing material\", but the presence of two films in the top 10 (Ted and Brave) featuring original characters is vaguely heartening. Less encouragingly, these two hits benefited from the cachet of the brands behind them \u2013 Pixar, and Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane \u2013 and are in genres (animation, comedy) that have traditionally proved more open to original ideas.</p> <h2><strong>Loser: Jump-starting the summer&#xa0;in spring</strong></h2> <p>Hollywood studios have long grumbled about the craziness of concentrating so many expensive pictures into the four&#xa0;months of the summer movie season, which runs from May to August. This year, thanks to Euro 2012 football and the Olympics turning chunks of the summer schedule into virtual no-go areas, they had the perfect opportunity to try a different tack. Disney released John Carter in March, and Universal unleashed Battleship in the UK in April. Loss-making final grosses of \u00a34.7m and \u00a37.5m resulted.</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Secret Cinema</strong></h2> <p>With its themed presentations of movie classics in limited runs at unusual locations, Secret Cinema long&#xa0;ago hit on an original formula fusing cinema with live participatory theatre. How to grow profit remained a challenge, but the organisation's presentation in June of its first new-release blockbuster, Prometheus, delivered a win for all parties. With 38 showings spread out over a secrecy-challenging 28 days, Secret Cinema achieved box-office of \u00a3730,000, and established a model for the future.</p> <h2><strong> Loser: Foreign language</strong><br></h2> <p>Away from the intense competition of awards season, the summer can usually be relied upon to deliver a big foreign-language hit, and past successes include La Vie En Rose, Coco Before Chanel and Tell No One. This summer, outside of Asian martial arts actioner The Raid and Bollywood, there were no significant foreign successes. Instead, documentaries (in the English language) stepped up to occupy the space, with impressive grosses for both The Imposter (\u00a3694,000 so far) and Searching for Sugar Man (\u00a3331,000).</p> <h2><strong>Winner: Scotland</strong></h2> <p>The film market may be global, but it's also national. In most of the UK, Ken Loach's The Angels' Share was positioned as another critically acclaimed offering from one of the country's most celebrated auteurs, albeit one of his more lighthearted efforts. In Scotland, the whisky caper was presented in a mainstream way as the country's answer to The Full Monty, and played every multiplex. Of the \u00a31.9m final UK and Ireland gross, 72% was achieved north of the border. With Brave, Disney achieved 19.4% of its UK/Ireland total in Scotland, as against 8% for a typical Pixar film.</p> <h2><strong>Top 10 films in UK, summer 2012</strong><br></h2> <p><strong>1</strong> The Dark Knight Rises, \u00a354.5m</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Marvel Avengers Assemble, \u00a351.8m</p> <p><strong>3</strong> Ice Age 4: Continental Drift, \u00a329.1m</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Ted, \u00a328.1m</p> <p><strong>5</strong> The Amazing Spider-Man, \u00a325.8m</p> <p><strong>6</strong> Prometheus, \u00a324.7m</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Men in Black 3, \u00a322.0m</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Brave, \u00a317.9m</p> <p><strong>9</strong> American Pie: Reunion, \u00a316.8m</p> <p><strong>10</strong> Snow White and the Huntsman, \u00a315.8m</p>",
  "<p>The French have done it again, striking cinematic gold with another unlikely film. First it was The Artist, a love story embraced by audiences and showered with Oscars even though it is silent. Now an irreverent film about disability has broken box-office records across the world.</p> <p>Just as the Paralympics are changing perceptions about disability, cinema is pushing at the same boundaries with <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434/\" title=\"\">Untouchable</a>, an uplifting comedy about the friendship that develops between a wealthy quadriplegic, Philippe, and his carer, Driss, an ex-convict.</p> <p>Audiences are flocking to see it. It has sold nearly three times as many tickets worldwide as The Artist, though it has not yet opened in several major territories \u2013 including the UK, Japan, Australia, Scandinavia and Latin America. Box-office takings are a staggering $366m so far, compared with The Artist's $134m for its entire global run. Made for just $10.5m, Untouchable is topping national charts, including those of Switzerland, Spain, Italy, South Korea and Germany, (where it has become the highest-grossing French film) and figures exceed those for blockbusters such as Harry Potter in some countries.</p> <p><a href=\"http://plus.lefigaro.fr/note/based-on-a-true-story-intouchables-draws-crowds-20111115-599678\" title=\"\">Based on a true story</a>, the friendship between the two men develops after the millionaire's paragliding accident. The Senegal-born ex-convict becomes his carer despite stealing a Faberg\u00e9 egg during his job interview, and the pair are drawn together by honesty and humour, fear and friendship. Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who spotted the global potential of The Artist, loved Untouchable so much that he snapped up the rights to <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118052056\" title=\"\">an English-language remake</a>, which will star Colin Firth, before it was even finished.</p> <p>Untouchable is both heartbreaking and, at times, very funny. The two men discover that they both have disadvantages in life \u2013 one a physical disability, the other socioeconomic. The film confronts the emotional and physical implications of paralysis, and the way that society makes disabled people invisible or \"untouchable\".</p> <p>It has struck a chord with the public perhaps because we live in a time of global crisis, says Eric Toledano, who wrote and directed Untouchable with Olivier Nakache. He says that the film redefines our heroic image, from yesterday's \"superhero\" to \"two simple people who can accept the fragility of their lives\". He adds: \"We just tried to make love with this story ... the humour saves these two people. It's a kind of British humour. The British can joke about everything, even misery.\"</p> <p>The filmmakers struggled to interest investors; there was nervousness about disability. One financier even asked whether the character could \"walk a little bit\". However, the French companies Gaumont, Canal+ and TF1 saw the potential.</p> <p>Inspiration came to Toledano and Nakache after they happened to watch a documentary about Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who was left a quadriplegic after a paragliding accident, and his Algeria-born carer Abdel Sellou. The directors and actors visited Di Borgo, who insisted that they made a comedy and went on to act as the film's adviser.</p> <p>Portraying a man paralysed from the neck down was a particular challenge, says Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet, one of France's most respected actors. \"I'm an actor who isn't fond of dialogue and who loves to act silently. That means I usually need my body to express things \u2026 Driss becomes my body in a way.\"</p> <p>Toledano adds: \"All the acting is in the eyes. It's very hard.\"</p> <p>As soon as he read the script, Omar Sy, a rising French actor who won a Cesar for this film, responded to it. His own story is a rags-to-riches fairytale. He says: \"I think it's a very human story, and it's funny and touching \u2026 Philippe chooses Driss as his caretaker partly because he doesn't see him as disabled or pity him. He just sees another person.\"</p> <p>Toledano has been overwhelmed by reactions from disabled people, including those associated with The Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation, dedicated to curing spinal-cord injury and set up in memory of Hollywood actor Christopher Reeve who was left a quadriplegic after a horse-riding accident.</p> <p>Peter T Wilderotter, its president, says of Untouchable: \"Most times movies only display the despair of disability and do so in a way that doesn't portray the day-to-day challenges. This movie tells the story with truth and integrity and humour towards the ignorance that those who live with paralysis face each and every day. It is a true gift. It's as if Chris and Dana collaborated on the film.\"</p> <p>Toledano has received more than 3,000 thank-you messages from wheelchair users all over the world. \"You will cry if I show you all the messages I've received,\" he says. \"I am so proud.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Untouchable is released on 21 September.</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister's decision to bestow honours on five sacked government ministers is expected to come under scrutiny by a cross-party group of MPs meeting next week.</p> <p>The Public Administration select committee only last week issued <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-administration-select-committee/news/publication-of-honours-report2/\" title=\"\">a report</a> criticising the government for awarding knighthoods and other honours to too many politicians, civil servants and celebrities for \"doing their day job\", rather than people who work hard in their communities. Yesterday there was no formal response from the cross-party committee, headed by senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, but it is understood that at the next private meeting members are likely to re-open the issue and consider whether to hold another public evidence session, at which David Cameron or one of his staff could be asked to answer questions.</p> <p>The announcement that departing leader of the House of Commons, Sir George Young, would become a companion of honour, and that four other ministers were to be given knighthoods provoked widespread criticism that it was an \"abuse\" of the honours system.</p> <p>Labour MP Ben Bradshaw attacked, in particular, the apparently strange decision to award all five honours to men, and none to the departing women, in particular Caroline Spelman and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/cheryl-gillan\" title=\"\">Cheryl Gillan</a>, who lost seats in the cabinet.</p> <p>\"[David Cameron] needs to explain why he's giving knighthoods to sacked male ministers while ignoring more senior women \u2013 another example of the prime minister's women problem,\" said Bradshaw. \"In resuscitating the political honours system, Cameron is abandoning any remaining pretence of being the reforming politician he posed as before the general election.\"</p> <p>Although political experts suggested that it was likely that as departing cabinet ministers Spelman and Gillan would be made life peers in the next honours list, the decision to announce the honours for their male colleague earlier was seen as tactless.</p> <p>Downing Street defended the decision, saying that previous prime ministers had also awarded honours to departing ministers: an official later said it was believed that the last PM to do so between the regular announcements for the Queen's birthday in the summer and new year was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/john-major\" title=\"\">John Major</a>, the last Conservative prime minister, who was in office from 1990 to 1997.</p> <p>The prime minister's spokesman said: \"The prime minister believes that political service is an important form of public service.\"</p> <p>Asked why those four had been chosen while others, including departing cabinet ministers had not, he said: \"The prime minister felt that these individuals had a long and distinguished record of public service.\"</p> <p>The awards would not mean any fewer were available for non-politicians, he insisted, saying it was a separate process to the regular honours system. \"This won't have any effect on the rest of the honours system,\" he added.</p> <p>The five MPs awarded honours were Sir George Young, a hereditary baronet and departing leader of the house of commons, who was made a companion of honour, and among the ministers below cabinet level Tories James Paice, Edward Garnier and Gerald Howarth and Liberal Democrat Nick Harvey were awarded honours.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/daybreak/hottopics/david-cameron-plans-to-boost-economy/\" title=\"\">interview with ITV's Daybreak</a> program, Cameron denied reports that he had made three exiting ministers cry when he told them the news on Tuesday and Wednesday: \"That is not true, actually.\" Later Cameron's official spokesman was forced to deny reports that the PM had told departing environment minister Caroline Spelman that she was too old, and that he had been drinking wine when he sacked Welsh secretary Gillan.</p>",
  "<p>One of the challenges faced by research funders \u2013 both public and private \u2013 is how to maximise the amount of work being done on important problems, without institutionalising any particular dogma which may suppress novel ideas. The most common arrangement is to fund good researchers but refrain from being overly prescriptive about outcomes, and, in turn, the way to identify good researchers has been to look at the publications that follow the research they fund.</p> <p>In 1955, Eugene Garfield, the founder of the Institute for Scientific Information (now part of Thomson Reuters), introduced a means for identifying influential journals according to the number of times work appearing in them was cited. This process results in a number called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor\" title=\"\">impact factor</a> (IF), and it's build on the assumption that those whose works have been the most influential will be the most cited.</p> <p>However, as anyone who's compared the Twitter following of, say, pop singer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/rihanna\" title=\"\">Rihanna</a> to astrophysicist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/neiltyson\" title=\"\">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> knows, influence is only one dimension of importance. While useful for many (pre-digital) years, the IF system, not unlike some celebrities, is not aging gracefully. Not only has it been <a href=\"http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/08/13/sick-of-impact-factors/\" title=\"\">widely misapplied</a>, it has also had some unintended side effects. </p> <p>One of these is the widespread misuse of the IF to compare people. While some institutions now say they disallow the use of the IF in decision making, the steep competition for a slot in a high IF journal \u2013 among researchers who know the impact it could have on their careers \u2013 indicates otherwise. In fact, it was identified to be the chief culprit behind the failings of peer review in professor David Colquhoun's Guardian article about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/sep/05/publish-perish-peer-review-science\" title=\"\">peer review and the corruption of science</a>. Another worrying indictment of citation counting practices, is from a study which suggests that <a href=\"http://www.complex-systems.com/pdf/14-3-5.pdf\" title=\"\">authors had not read 80% of the papers they had cited</a>. With research workflows moving online, shouldn't we be able to follow what's going on in academia better than we did 50 years ago?</p> <p>There's a growing number of services which are making it possible to look beyond slow and inaccurate citation counts. <a href=\"http://www.mendeley.com\" title=\"\">Mendeley's open research database</a>, which provides metadata and real-time readership statistics, is queried more than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/aug/22/mendeley-apps-api-growth\" title=\"\">100 million times per month</a> by \"altmetrics\" (alternative metrics) apps such as Total-Impact.org, Readermeter.org, or Altmetric.com. Last month, research institutions in North America, Europe, Asia <a href=\"http://blog.mendeley.com/design-research-tools/leading-universities-adopt-mendeley-data-to-accelerate-research-analytics-by-3-years/\" title=\"\">signed up to a new Mendeley data dashboard</a> which analyses a university's research activity and impact on the global research community in real time.</p> <p>Jason Priem, a library and information science researcher at the University of North Carolina, and his colleague Heather Piwowar from the University of British Columbia, are the creators of <a href=\"http://total-impact.org\" title=\"\">Total-Impact</a>, which aggregates information from all over the web about how research is being used - beyond simple citations. Using tools like Total-Impact, responsible parties can define for themselves the appropriate metrics to support their decision making processes, whether finding collaborators, discovering research, or making funding or hiring decisions. In an email to me about the need for altmetrics, Jason writes: \"It's troublingly naive to imagine one type of metric could adequately inform evaluations across multiple disciplines, departments, career stages, and job types. We don't sign a first baseman on the speed of his fastball, nor should we evaluate every scholar, journal, or department based solely on their citation scores. Whether it's teaching, outreach, readership, provoking discussion, sharing software and data, or providing great feedback, altmetrics help us pay attention to, and reward, scholars and institutions that excel in these important areas\".</p> <p>This multi-dimensional approach allows any community to look at the indicators that matter to them, whether it's citations, bookmarks, or size of a researcher's network of collaborators. It enables them to use data to filter out what's valuable to them, whether it's identifying influential researchers or finding the most relevant research regardless of the prestige of the research group. It also helps them to consider dimensions of quality (as defined by each community) alongside quantitative indicators of impact or influence, such as numbers of citations.</p> <p>It's important to realise that the reason these tools can do what they do is because of a fundamental openness and interoperability: The places where articles are being written, read, and published or where presentations and software are being shared - such as PLOS, Twitter, Github or Mendeley - make their data available through standardised APIs, which allows librarians, researchers, and funders to pick and choose the data that's most meaningful for any particular use at any particular time.</p> <p>This openness and multiplicity of views goes hand in hand with open access publishing, which has now become the <a href=\"http://roarmap.eprints.org/view/type/funder=5Fmandate.html\" title=\"\">recommended practice of most major funding bodies</a>, including the EC, RCUK, the US NIH, Wellcome Trust and many others. Enabling open access journals to demonstrate their impact on academia via real-time data, years before they receive citations and thus an impact factor, helps them to recruit authors and increases the exposure of their content, further accelerating adoption of open access business models.</p> <p>Nobel laureate Paul Lauterbur famously said: \"You could write the entire history of science in the last 50 years in terms of papers rejected by Science or Nature\". Tempering the need to publish in high-IF journals and moving towards open access publishing models like <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/home.action\" title=\"\">PLOS ONE</a> \u2013 which reviews papers on rigour and technical merit, rather than perceived significance \u2013 will give us the chance the make the next 50 years of science look very different.

  "<p>Somehow, the noise never seems that bad from the actual airport. It certainly doesn't sound bad from Westminster. But in Hounslow, the London borough under the flight path for Heathrow's two runways, the planes loom unfeasibly large as they come in to land, with the background engine noise building up every ninety seconds or so to a conversation-defying eruption.</p> <p>In quieter places a consensus on Heathrow expansion has been steadily moulded by business and aviation executives: via discreet lobbying, a burgeoning file of reports, and conferences from London to Beijing. Backbench Tory MPs and union leaders alike have come out for the cause: warning Britain will lose its predominant place in global aviation, its access to growing markets. London will fall behind Paris, Frankfurt, even the Dutch, without more airport capacity. Foreign firms will relocate; jobs will go. In certain circles, the argument is a no-brainer: David Cameron's awkward pledge notwithstanding, once the Lib Dems are out of the coalition, he should crack on and do the obvious thing: build that third runway.</p> <p>For now it appears that the expansionists' economic arguments have won over the chancellor and very possibly the PM. But while a zealous belief in Cameron's manifesto commitment cost the last transport secretary her job, it may yet prove that Justine Greening, with her visceral grasp of life directly outside Heathrow, was far closer to where this debate ends up.</p> <p>Even if the economic benefits and the aviation's industry's need for more capacity are accepted \u2013 and both are disputed \u2013 the battle will be won or lost again over climate change and noise. Green arguments have fallen so far from the agenda as to prompt the Labour leader Ed Miliband this week to ask: \"But where is the debate about the environment in this?\" Environmental campaigners say they are ready to fight again if plans for the vanquished runway become something more than abstract.</p> <p>In Hounslow the noise is anything but abstract. The deputy leader of the council, Colin Ellar, points out: \"The impact on hundreds of thousands of people is undersold, under-reported, never stated.\" Pollution is one problem. \"But what we would really like is the mitigation of noise.\"</p> <p>Like all on the council, he does not doubt the benefits that the airport brings. \"The last thing we want is to see the airport disappear. It gives a level of prosperity to the area bigger than any other employer.\" He estimates 10,000-15,000 people and their families in each of the five boroughs surrounding Heathrow are directly financially dependent on the airport, either working or pensioners. Other employers are here because of the airport: Glaxo SmithKline, Samsung, with IBM and Cisco in nearby Bedfont Lakes.</p> <p>But, he says, \"What has evolved is a workable situation. We do not want a third runway \u2013 at any cost.\"</p> <p>In the well-insulated civic centre \u2013 as in BAA's head offices \u2013 aircraft noise is shielded out. But in homes and schools it is a very different matter.</p> <p>Students returned last week for the new year at Lampton school, an academy two miles from Heathrow and bang under the flight path to the northern runway. Aircraft noise crashes around the buildings so intensely it is easy initially to mistake where the plane is coming from, but then the pattern unfolds with grim regularity, as flights come in to land across the concrete yard and above the temporary classrooms where many are still taught.</p> <p>Much of the school is double glazed, but not air-conditioned \u2013 making summer months, say staff, a choice between stifling heat or the noise. On the worst affected top floor the science lab has the usual gas taps, plastic skeleton \u2013 and its own experiment in trying to teach children when normal speech becomes inaudible 30-40 times per lesson.</p> <p>In a study area in the sixth-form centre, a small breeze-block construction with open windows, signed in large capitals (bar a missing T) but with no apparent irony is the QUIE ZONE, which for 10 seconds in every 90 is anything but. Rochelle Kahlon, 17, studying for A-levels, shrugs. \"It's quieter here than it is at home.\" Only outsiders are surprised, says classmate Saabah Elahi. Both girls have close family who work at the airport.</p> <p>Ray Whyms, an assistant head teacher, says: \"It is normal for them. But then people get used to prison.\"</p> <p>Incredibly, this school has achieved outstanding pass rates at exams. \"But we don't really know how much better it would be, \" says Whyms. \"The long-term effects are immeasurable or difficult to quantify \u2013 who knows what damage it does.\"</p> <p>Polly Shoebridge, a psychology teacher, says: \"When I first came here I couldn't believe how noisy it was.\" Five years later she is used to it, but says when a plane comes over, \"you just have to stop. You lose five minutes a class.\"</p> <p>BAA has signed up to a scheme that offers free double glazing to mitigate noise. But the council believes it is nowhere near enough \u2013 and particularly for schools whose renovations were lost when Labour's schoolbuilding programme was scrapped by Michael Gove. The cost of properly soundproofing children's classrooms for the borough's 60 schools under the flight path is something Hounslow says it cannot, and should not have to, pay for.</p> <p>Ellar, who lives virtually under the descent to the northern runway, has had the BAA double glazers in. But he points out it depends on individuals to apply, only soundproofs the bedroom rather than all of the house, and does little for those who want to open a window on a summer night. New generations of planes such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner are quieter, as well as less polluting, but not enough to ensure a night's sleep.</p> <p>One of Greening's last acts was to publish plans for tougher fines on noisy aircraft, and new ways to measure how noise really impacts people. \"She got it,\" said John Stewart, of local action group HACAN.</p> <p>But now Greening is reshuffled and her long-awaited \"call for evidence\" apparently scrapped. If the Tories' opposition pledge to halt Heathrow expansion wasn't dropped as quickly as the party's natural business and aviation supporters hoped, the wheels are now in motion. Osborne's support for a third runway is an open secret. But Labour found to its cost how politically toxic the third runway was, losing marginal seats and arguably London. Instead, the government is setting up a commission on airport expansion to draw out the electoral sting, led by Howard Davies, an ex-CBI boss and former adviser to climate change \"sceptic\" Nigel Lawson.</p> <p>The phoney war is on: Davies's commission won't reach its conclusions until after 2015, leaving the Tories officially opposed yet privately set to deliver. Yet those within the party \u2013 Zac Goldsmith, who thought Cameron's pledge more than greenwash \u2013 and now Boris Johnson are not playing along, and the PM may yet be forced to make his position clear.</p> <p>Eventually the decision will need to be taken. BAA meanwhile has started drawing up its own review, to demonstrate that the \"do-nothing\" option is also a political choice with economic consequences.</p> <p>Heathrow is full, at the limit of flights it is permitted or can cope with operationally. The pressure on its runways makes it vulnerable to huge disruption from small incidents. While other airports could take more flights, BAA says a sufficiently large hub airport is unique and essential for the airline business: a hub provides enough connecting passengers to make all sorts of flights to and from new destinations viable. That would allow more trade with emerging markets that would provide more jobs and badly needed economic growth. And Britain can only have one hub, they say, and that hub is Heathrow.</p> <p>That orthodoxy is still disputed by some even within aviation, including some regional airports. But most buy the hub logic \u2014 including Johnson, although his derided Thames Estuary plan still looks impossible on many levels. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary claims Stansted is the only feasible place for expansion soon. Gatwick's ban on a new runway expires in 2019 and the blueprints for a second are being refreshed. An unnamed consortium is said to be examining possibilities for a brand new four-runway airport in Oxfordshire, where the prime minister's constituency and his Chipping Norton friends could experience the Heathrow effect for themselves.</p> <p>BAA believes the ground has been covered enough times before to make the course of action obvious. It welcomes the impending Davies commission which, if legitimised in advance by a cross-party consensus, will mean it won't need to face down MPs fearing for their seats. Only, perhaps, environmentalists and the 750,000 people living under the flight path.</p>",
  "<p>While all eyes have been on Oscar Pistorius and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/05/paralympics-running-blades-pistorius\" title=\"\">the \"battle of the blades\"</a>, many other anomalies, inequalities and injustices in Paralympic sport have been overlooked. As a wheelchair racer, I am passionate about the sport: the adrenaline rush on the track, the medals, even the long hours of training. However, I have encountered many disturbing things during my career: in particular, a lack of&#xa0;clarity surrounding both classification of disability and selection, and the absence of a level playing field for those competing.</p> <p>Classification continues to be a controversial issue. In 2008 at the Beijing Games, Rebecca Chin was disqualified for not being disabled enough. I was left paralysed from the chest down after suffering from polio when I was two. When I began racing competitively, I was given a permanent classification of T53 \u2013 this is&#xa0;for athletes with no trunk function, and the correct category for my disability. Yet I was pulled out of a major competition in 2006 and reclassified into a more able-bodied category (T54) after a cursory medical and fitness test.</p> <p>A subsequent expert medical report confirmed that I was paralysed from the chest down: the prerequisite for T53. Yet despite the overwhelming evidence, I lost the six-year battle to be returned to my rightful category \u2013 a category in which, based on the racing times I've achieved in recent years, I would win medals for Great Britain. Unlike in the Olympic Games, the criteria for Paralympic selection are not transparent. Despite being ranked number one in the UK in the 100m sprint, and number seven in the world, I was not selected for&#xa0;the 2012 Games.</p> <p>And then there is the issue of equipment&#xa0;\u2013 illustrated by the Pistorius row over blade length, but not confined to it. Many disabled athletes rely on equipment, and this varies in quality. Superior wheelchairs and state-of-the-art prostheses can give athletes an unfair&#xa0;advantage over less well-equipped rivals. How can athletes from less well-off countries possibly compete as equals when they have no access to any sort of equipment, let alone the latest Paralympic mod cons? Haitian athletes Nephtalie Jean Lois and Josue Cajuste had to borrow equipment when they arrived in the UK. In addition, I am the UK's only black female Paralympian, and more could be done by UK Athletics and others to encourage more black athletes to get involved. When it comes to able-bodied sport, of course each body is different. But what they have in common is that all of them are whole and healthy and strong. Whether a runner comes from Rwanda or Rochdale, as long as they have ground under their feet to practise on, all have an equal opportunity to win.</p> <p>As disabled athletes, our imperfect bodies will always be unequal: the swimmers with short legs competing against those with no legs; those with one leg racing against those with two. Some of these inequalities cannot be ironed out. But others are deliberately manufactured by human beings and must be eliminated. While it is wonderful that so many people want to celebrate the real achievements of disabled athletes, few shine a light into some of the darker corners of this sport. The same rigour that roots out injustice in able-bodied elite sport must be applied to disabled elite sport.</p> <p>Many Paralympic competitors are inspirational, demonstrating exceptional athleticism and overcoming tremendous adversity. For me there is no bigger thrill than tearing round the track with the wind in my face. But I want to compete with my peers, not with those who are more able-bodied than I am. And I want athletes like the Congolese wheelchair racer, Dedeline Mibamba Kimbata, to have a wheelchair as good as that of her rivals from richer countries, so that she can compete fairly with western racers. The winners and losers of the disabled world's most prestigious sporting event should not be determined by global postcodes and bank balances, nor by arbitrary classification or selection decisions. But sadly they are.</p> <p>More needs to be done to ensure that&#xa0;all disabled athletes are competing in their rightful class: the selection process must be made accountable. Athletes from poorer countries must get&#xa0;more support so that they can compete as equals. Ensuring justice in Paralympic sport is far more challenging than in the able-bodied equivalent, but&#xa0;in order to preserve the sport's integrity, it must be done.</p>",
  "<p>It was a good day for a company to release good news, with the markets in euphoric mood after European Central Bank president Mario Draghi unveiled his bond buying plan to save the euro.</p> <p>With mining groups and banks - the classic risk-on stocks - leading the way, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 119.48 points higher at 5777.34, its biggest one day rise since 3 August.</p> <p>The good news came from <strong>Whitbread.</strong> The Premier Inns, Costa Coffee and restaurant group said like for like sales grew 4.3% in the second quarter, a better than expected increase which prompted analysts to raise their full year forecasts. There were some positive one off effects - the Olympics, the timing of half-term and the poor weather helping Costa sales - but even so, the market liked the figures and Whitbread's shares added 111p to \u00a322.10.</p> <p>The long awaited ECB announcement seemed, for once, not to disappoint, even though much of the detail had already been leaked, while there were some concerns that Spain was now left in a quandary as to whether it could accept help under the ECB's terms.</p> <p>Even a dispute between the ECB and the Bundesbank coming into the open could not dent the mood, nor could the OECD downgrading growth forecasts for a number of countries, including the UK. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> The markets clearly liked what Mario Draghi had to say and so they should have as he effectively placed the central bank in the position of being the lender of last resort, without being the institution that actually issues any securities. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, ahead of Friday's US non-farm payroll figures came encouraging news on the American jobs front. The monthly ADP survey of private employers showed 201,000 jobs were added in August, much higher than forecasts of a 140,000 increase. Analysts are expecting the non-farm data to show a rise of around 150,000.</p> <p>Mining shares, which had been weaker on global growth worries, regained some ground. Russia's <strong>Polymetal</strong> ended 63p higher at \u00a310.20, while <strong>Antofagasta</strong> added 61p to \u00a311.57 and <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> rose 51p to 928p. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets cut their target price for Vedanta from \u00a314 to \u00a313 after lowering their forecasts for zinc, aluminium and copper, but kept their outperform rating on the Indian mining group.</p> <p><strong>Lonmin</strong> was lifted 38.5p to 568p after the troubled platinum miner agreed a peace deal with South Africa's National Union of Mineworkers, following four weeks of strikes and protests which saw 34 people shot dead. But another union, the AMCU, said it had not signed the deal, so only 1.7% of workers turned up at Lonmin's operations on Thursday.</p> <p>Analysts believe the company may have to raise up to $1.25bn in a rights issue. On top of all that, Lonmin's chief executive Ian Farmer is suffering an illness.</p> <p>Meanwhile, traders were speculating that <strong>Xstrata</strong>, which owns nearly 25% of Lonmin, could turn its attention to the platinum miner if <strong>Glencore</strong>'s plan to merge with Xstrata is voted down by shareholders at a meeting on Friday. Xstrata added 43.9p to 979p while Glencore rose 2.85p to 392.35p.</p> <p>But Indonesian coal miner <strong>Bumi</strong>, floated in London by financier Nat Rothschild, continued its recent decline, edging down 0.3p to 268.4p. It has lost more than a quarter of its value in just over a week, on worries about the financial health of the Bakrie Group, which owns 30% of the company, as well as trading at Bumi Resources, where it owns 29%. Bumi Resources recently reported a \u00a3203m half year loss amid weaker coal prices, and has debts of around \u00a32.5bn.</p> <p>Among the banks, <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> ended 2.27p to 36.2p and <strong>Barclays</strong> was 11.1p better at 193.05p.</p> <p><strong>Aviva</strong> added 17.4p to 344.9p, helped by the general market buoyancy and by Fitch saying the rating outlook for the UK life insurance sector remained stable.</p> <p>Transport group <strong>Go-Ahead</strong> accelerated 18p to \u00a313, despite a 3.4% fall in full year profits to \u00a394.2m, mainly due to a one-off rail management benefit last year. It said rail revenues and profits had held up, although the difficult economic conditions had started to impact its Southern franchise, where the bidding model had assumed stronger growth at this point. Its deregulated bus operations delivered record operating profits, and it added four new businesses during the year. In all it saw record passenger numbers of 1.1bn. John Lawson at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> Go-Ahead has delivered another strong trading performance with an increase in underlying operating profits of \u00a38.1m, adjusting for one-off rail management contracts in 2011. Current trading is in line and we re-iterate our buy with a target price of \u00a314. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>ValiRx</strong> jumped 8.5% to 0.705p after the life science minnow reported positive results for its Val201 compound in an early stage breast cancer study.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/06/putin-hang-glider-endangered-cranes\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin's latest publicity stunt</a> features a video of him in a microlight aircraft guiding a flock of young Siberian cranes on their migration route. As unlikely as it seems, by donning the all-over white suit and a large pair of goggles, the Russian president temporarily became a surrogate parent to the endangered juvenile cranes.</p> <p>Known as imprinting, the phenomenon by which certain bird species attach themselves to the first living thing they see after birth, was popularised by the Austrian zoologist Konrad Lorenz in the 1950s. Since then, imprinting has been observed in a number of bird species including geese, ducks and, of course, cranes.</p> <p>Damon Bridge, who works for the RSPB and the <a href=\"http://www.thegreatcraneproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Great Crane Project</a> to reintroduce cranes in the UK, explains: \"The Americans with their <a href=\"http://www.savingcranes.org/whooping-crane.html\" title=\"\">whooping crane</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.savingcranes.org/\" title=\"\">International Crane Foundation (ICF)</a> were the first people to pioneer what is known as the 'puppet-rearing technique'. Cranes are very similar to birds like geese and ducks which imprint on people, or the first thing they see. It happens when they're very young, but it's permanent. The first thing they see that's providing food, comfort and shelter is the thing they regard as a parent.\"</p> <p>Although the Great Crane Project doesn't involve the use of microlights as the populations are non-migratory, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/jul/27/return-great-crane-uk\" title=\"\">volunteers use similar suits to the one that Putin wore as well as hand puppets when looking after juvenile cranes</a>. \"If we hand-reared them they would forever think people were their parents and they wouldn't survive in the wild,\" Bridge says.</p> <p>Siberian cranes migrate south to escape the Arctic winters, and it normally falls to the adult birds to teach their young the migration routes, allowing the knowledge to pass down through many generations. However once numbers decline or the population becomes extinct, the inherited knowledge is lost and has to be retaught to juvenile birds to reestablish their natural migration routes.</p> <p>\"Migration isn't a natural instinct,\" says Bridge, \"their parents teach them to migrate. So if you want to teach them migration routes you can do it, amazingly, by wearing one of the costumes, jumping in a microlight and they'll follow.</p> <p>\"Even though it's a weird, large, noisy thing ... they don't see that. They just see their parent heading off and follow them.\"</p> <p>The RSPB's Tony Whitehead, said: \"Birds have small brains, with basic disguising, the young cranes are perfectly happy to accept rigid wings, engines and even Russian presidents as mummy and daddy.\"</p> <p>In spite of critics who might just see this as another political publicity stunt for the self-styled action man, the Russian president can be considered to have done a very good thing in bringing attention to a critically endangered species. The <a href=\"http://www.savingcranes.org/siberian-crane.html\" title=\"\">Siberian cranes are in rapid decline</a> with estimated numbers in the region of 2,900-3,000. Their listing as critically endangered is the highest category of threat before extinction used by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).</p> <p>In his role as crane-leader, Putin also follows in the footsteps of the world-record breaking Italian aviator, Angelo d'Arrigo. Known as the human condor, in 2003 d'Arrigo guided a flock of Siberian cranes to the Caspian Sea in Iran. Putin's own flight took place at the Arctic Kushavet ornithological research station, located on Russia's Pacific coast.</p> <p>There are 15 species of cranes, 11 of which are facing extinction.</p>",
  "<p>A little-noticed outcome of the microfinance movement has been the proliferation of rural sales networks in developing countries, where poor women earn an income by selling products door-to-door. Usually billed as entrepreneurship, these systems are typically assembled by outside parties such as banks offering microloans or social entrepreneurs selling products deemed prosocial, such as solar lanterns.</p> <p>Lately, however, large global corporations such as Coca-Cola have stepped into the arena, loudly assuming the task of empowering women, while at the same time quietly extending their own reach into untouched markets. (Yes, there are still places in the world where you can't get a Coke.)</p> <p>The involvement of multinationals in rural sales networks has elicited a familiar barrage of criticisms. Consider some from a recent Oxford debate: multinationals exploit poverty as a business opportunity, marketing wasteful goods to people who can't afford them. Or, rural sales networks are a smokescreen providing companies with an army of cheap labour. Or, global business is like Pac Man, gobbling up local vendors across rural Asia and Africa through door-to-door sales. We could go on. But the basic argument is this: corporations are evil and their products corrupt the poor; NGOs and governments are the right actors to fight poverty.</p> <p>When this anti-corporate fundamentalism dominates the dialogue, a key issue is driven underground. Evidence has now unequivocally linked women's equality to better development outcomes. We are dismayed that conditions unique to gender justice \u2013 and dramatically manifest in rural sales networks \u2013 are so consistently subsumed under this state-versus-market dogma.</p> <p>We spent five years studying two important women's entrepreneurship networks: JITA, an innovative system built by <a href=\"http://www.careinternational.org.uk/where-we-work/bangladesh\" title=\"\">CARE International in Bangladesh</a>, and the expansion of the 125-year-old behemoth that is <a href=\"http://www.avon.co.za/PRSuite/home_page.page\" title=\"\">Avon Products into South Africa</a>. Both systems offer poor women who have few other income-earning opportunities the chance to make money by selling consumer goods. The <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/Documents/BoP/RSP_Case_2012_RN.PDF\" title=\"\">results of our JITA research</a> were recently published and our <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/newsandevents/Documents/Avon%20in%20Africa%20Case%20Study.pdf\" title=\"\">findings on Avon</a>, which have sparked a lively debate, have just been released.</p> <p>While we would not argue that either of these systems is problem-free, exploring them emphasised for us why it is gender, rather than capitalism, that should be the focus here.</p> <h2>Focusing on women</h2> <p>The radical innovation in microfinance was monetising women. Loan sharks have always made credit available to the poor at astronomical rates. What was new about microfinance was making business loans to women who were subject to exclusionary norms and thus had no capital. Credit essentially mobilised an economically captive population.</p> <p>Money, being fungible, is dangerous. In both sites we studied, Bangladesh and South Africa, women are profoundly weakened by tradition, and the rates of violence against them are among the highest in the world. Evidence suggests that men would bully women into taking loans from microfinance companies, then expropriate the funds for themselves. When the women wanted to repay the loan, violence often followed.</p> <p>Deep pockets hold security. Avon is big and stable enough to work without microcredit. They advance inventory on orders, interest free, telling reps to open bank accounts so commissions can be deposited directly. Avon watches the inventory exposure closely so that neither they nor the reps suffer bad debt. The physical and financial vulnerability presented by cash loaned out at high rates is avoided.</p> <h2>Large organisations make powerful allies</h2> <p>In Bangladesh, where female seclusion or purdah is practised, moving beyond the home is a transgression of gender norms. CARE worked directly with community elders to secure approval for the women to work. Both CARE and Avon step in to help provide safety and counselling support. Both advocate on behalf of women with other institutions, such as church and government.</p> <p>A woman's market is her domain. CARE personnel assembled a basket of goods for women to sell by recruiting multinationals including Unilever, Danone, Bata and Bic. The basket is light enough to take across unpaved terrain, but includes items that vary by volume, weight, purchase cycle, seasonality and appeal. This carefully balanced portfolio minimises market risk, but each woman is free to add anything else she can carry and thinks will sell. Everything from hair ornaments to condoms turns up in these bags. Similarly, Avon provides a variety of goods beyond cosmetics that reps may add as they see fit. Other systems limit saleswomen to items deemed \"good for the poor\", forcing foreign values and heavy carrying costs on the participants. We further believe that consumer goods strongly identified with the feminine sphere, such as cleansers and cosmetics, are less threatening to the gender norms already being challenged by the earning power and mobility offered to the women.</p> <h2>Sisterhood matters</h2> <p>Both CARE and Avon are dedicated to women's empowerment. Both bring experience and sophistication in gender matters into local situations that are largely hostile to women. Both emphasise solidarity with other females. The networks thus built are, in themselves, consequential institutions.</p> <p>Women have few structural friends. In both sites, women are significantly constrained by laws, customs, and religious strictures that refuse them property and inheritance rights, alongside basic freedoms and protections. The notion that governments are, by definition, friendly to women simply does not stack up to the facts. Contrary to conventional wisdom, business can be a better ally.</p> <p>The proof is in the pudding. Both systems have established track records showing they can give significantly disadvantaged women, including those who are illiterate and innumerate, an opportunity to earn an income they can live and rely on. This is no mean achievement. All other criticisms should be measured against it.</p> <p>Charges currently being levelled against these systems often seem to us hasty and unsuitable for the challenges faced by women. Patriarchy predates capitalism by thousands of years. It has been built, perpetuated and delivered by all institutions, including both business and government. Achieving gender justice will require respect for the particularities of this form of inequality, openness to new solutions and a willingness to accept that the market can empower rather than oppress women.</p> <p><em>Linda Scott is DP world chair for entrepreneurship and innovation at the Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford.</em></p> <p><em>Catherine Dolan is a lecturer in the marketing, culture, and society programme at the Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Ed Miliband has moved to exploit tensions within the coalition and among Liberal Democrats by declaring he is \"open for business\" with Vince Cable, who describes himself as the cabinet's only social democrat.</p> <p>As supporters of Nick Clegg express growing irritation with Cable, dubbed leader of the \"Continuity SDP\", the Labour leader said he had recently exchanged texts with the business secretary.</p> <p>\"Open for business,\" Miliband said as the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, explained in a joint appearance at a Policy Network conference how Labour was willing to talk to Cable, who was an adviser to the late Labour leader John Smith when he was a cabinet minister in the 1970s.</p> <p>Balls said he would be happy to talk to Cable about his proposal, drawn up by the Lib Dems' former Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott, for a mansion tax on properties worth more than \u00a32m. \"We said [at the time of the budget] that we didn't think a mansion tax to fund top-rate tax cuts was a good idea,\" Balls said. \"But if Vince Cable or George Osborne wanted to have serious discussions with us about a cross-party consensus on a mansion tax for good and fair and long-term purposes that is a discussion we would like to have.\"</p> <p>As the audience laughed, Balls added: \"The conclusion we have reached is George Osborne doesn't want to have that discussion at all. Nor does Nick Clegg. But if Vince Cable would like to sit down and have a serious conversation about how we can make our economy work for the long term then we can have that discussion.\"</p> <p>At this point Miliband intervened to say: \"Open for business.\"</p> <p>The Labour leader also acknowledged that he had been in text contact with Cable. \"I exchange texts with lots of different people. Wisdom doesn't reside in one political party&#xa0;\u2026 [But] the Liberal Democrats made a tragic mistake [on the deficit]. I welcome all people who recant.\"</p> <p>Balls joked: \"Exchanging texts is always a dangerous thing.\"</p> <p>Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, said Cable had exchanged one text with Miliband over House of Lords reform.</p> <p>Miliband and Balls made a joint appearance at the Policy Network conference, held at the London Stock Exchange, to launch the start of the new political year with a fresh approach on the economy. This is known as predistribution, in contrast with the traditional centre-left approach of redistributing wealth from the rich to the less well-off.</p> <p>In his speech Miliband said that a Labour government would always believe in redistribution. But with less money to redistribute a Labour government would focus attention on pushing up wages by equipping the workforce with better skills.</p> <p>Miliband said: \"The redistribution of the last Labour government relied on revenue which the next Labour government will not enjoy. The option of simply increasing tax credits in the way we did before will not be open to us.</p> <p>\"Of course, redistribution will always remain necessary. But we've learned that it is not sufficient.</p> <p>\"We need to care about predistribution as well as redistribution. Redistribution offers a top-up to wages [of the low paid]. Predistribution seeks to offer them more: higher skills, with higher wages.</p> <p>\"Centre-left governments of the past tried to make work pay better by spending more on transfer payments. Centre-left governments of the future will have to also make work pay better by making work itself pay.\"</p> <p>Miliband also launched a strong attack on Osborne for adopting a \"wrong-headed\" approach on the environment. \"The current chancellor poses the environment and the economy as, essentially, alternatives,\" he said. \"So either you can have a successful environment or you can have a successful economy. That is totally wrong-headed. We know that a lot of the future jobs in this country will come from the green industries of the future.\"</p> <p>John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace, said: \"George Osborne must stop holding back Britain's low-carbon businesses. Everybody from the CBI to the Labour leadership to green groups are now urging him to back these growing industries. This sector provided around a third of all growth in the economy over the past year, and Ed Miliband is right to highlight how it should be central to our economic recovery.\"</p> <p>Oakeshott said: \"Liberal Democrats will welcome support for the Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment to a mansion tax wherever it comes from, even from Ed Balls the prodigal son. But the wealth gap widened to a yawning chasm in his years at the Treasury and he wouldn't say boo to a non-dom goose.\"</p>",

Additionally these derogatory terms almost universally refer to mental illness in some fashion. </p> <p>During the 2012 <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/sports/\">Paralympics</a>, Channel 4 is showing a programme hosted by comedian <a href=\"http://paralympics.channel4.com/the-team/presenter=adamhills/\">Adam Hills</a>. (<a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/programme/ry5gz/the-last-leg-with-adam-hills\">The Last Leg with Adam Hills</a>. It's a pun, please don't be wrong-footed. That was another pun (a much worse one). One section of this programme involves Adam discussing with <a href=\"http://paralympics.channel4.com/the-team/presenter=AlexBrooker/\">Alex Brooker</a> what you can and cannot say about the Paralympics: a frank discussion about the taboos inevitably involved when discussing disability.</p> <p>Primarily their advice revolves around the content of speech. \"Just don't be horrible\" \u2013 a seemingly simple piece of advice that needs to be tattooed backwards across the heads of whoever is writing THOSE comments on YouTube. </p> <p>Hills and Brooker state that you probably will say the wrong thing and not to panic if you do. An example of such a wrong thing is given (source mercifully not provided): \"In the Paralympic equestrian events, is it the horse or the rider who is disabled?\" </p> <p>The point is not to control what you should and shouldn't say but rather to create an environment where people at least think about what they're saying before being horrible or downright offensive. </p> <p>Despite the first paragraph of this blog being about mental illness, I'm not trying to conflate being disabled with being mentally ill. Rather we should note that while people increasingly take care about the language they use to describe the disabled, the same luxury is often not afforded to those with mental illness. </p> <p>You would correctly frown (I don't know how you'd incorrectly frown, possibly a problem with your <a href=\"http://face-and-emotion.com/dataface/expression/corrugator.html\">corrugator muscle</a>) about someone with a stubbed toe saying \"I'm a little bit crippled\". But you wouldn't pay the slightest attention to someone tidying their desk saying \"I'm a little bit obsessive compulsive.\" </p> <p>I can almost hear the cries of political correctness gone mad. Except if political correctness really had gone mad, we wouldn't be allowed to use the phrase, political correctness gone mad. Possibly you'd be forced to say political correctness had become a little bit obsessive compulsive. </p> <p>The casual use of language stigmatising mental illness is exceedingly common. <a href=\"http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/stigma\">Stigma</a> can be described as a sign of disgrace setting a person apart from others. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman\">Erving Goffman</a>, defined stigma as, \"the process by which the actions of others spoil normal identity.\" For those with mental illness the stigma experienced can result in a lack of funding for services, difficulty gaining employment, a mortgage or holiday insurance. Ultimately, feelings of stigma cause people to delay seeking help or even deny they have symptoms in the first place. </p> <p>Casual language used to describe mental illness is decidedly negative. He or she is described as going mad, mental or psycho. Media portrayals reinforce this with images of violence and homicide associated with mental ill health. It was rare to see a discussion concerning the recent shootings in Aurora, Denver, without comments about the shooter's mental health status. </p> <p>Even children's television seems to have gotten in on the act. One study in the <a href=\"http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/176/5/440.full\">British Journal of Psychiatry </a>found that out of a sample of one week of children's television, 59 out of 128 programmes contained one or more references to mental illness. Terms like \"crazy\", \"mad\" and \"losing your mind\" were commonly used to denote losing control. Six characters were identified as being consistently portrayed as mentally ill. These characters were almost totally devoid of positive characteristics. I'm not sure if one of these was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_(character)\">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>. Why would a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge\">porifera</a> even need trousers? Some sort of <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/help/diagnoses_and_conditions/body_dysmorphic_disorder\">body dysmorphia</a> ? </p> <p>The sign \"You don't have to be crazy to work here but it helps\" has become so common that it's a clich\u00e9. People describing themselves as \"a bit mad\" usually mean that they've worn a sparkly hat at some point. Terms like mentalist, psycho, bonkers, insane and barking are thrown around like loose pennies in a conversational washing machine. Look at Terry, the mentalist. He's bonkers. He's so drunk he's gone outside to punch the thunder for annoying the moon. Mad! </p> <p>An argument could be made that these terms, while technically describing mental illness are not being used to specifically refer to mental illness. Rather they are referring to behaviour which they consider a little out of the ordinary. We can refer to this argument as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/joepublic/2011/oct/19/ricky-gervais-mong-twitter\">Gervais's Gambit</a>. The problem is that if this language is making people with mental illness feel stigmatised, ashamed and isolated then the amount of thought behind it as it is used casually is largely irrelevant. </p> <p>If you are so attached to using a word you don't want to put any thought behind it before you use it that's fine. I am more than happy for you to take your dictionary on a romantic weekend away if you promise to use your technical definitions in private without hurting anyone. \"But nobody I know has complained about me using this language.\" Well no, perhaps the people you know with mental illness are too worried you'll call them crazy and laugh at their inability to sing. </p> <p>And you will know somebody with mental illness. With estimates of one in four (most likely higher) people being affected it would defy statistics if you didn't. And only <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics\">Benjamin Disraeli </a>is allowed to defy statistics. <br> Ultimately people are not going to stop using these terms stigmatising mental illness. It could be argued that at least one comment I've made during this article does just that. They are as entrenched in language as the saying of <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lol\">\"lol\"</a> is instead of actually laughing. As a side note, shouldn't people who say lol instead of laughing, write it as lolol to describe laughing? </p> <p>Like the thought that should go into that distracting parody of text speak, it would be enough that people thought about what they are trying to express and whom they will hurt. Especially as it's likely to be someone close to them. You can still make your jokes and use the words, but consider whether another word might do and who you may hurt beforehand. Perhaps then we can move towards a frank and honest dialogue about mental illness and away from the disgrace and stigma. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists </a>along with mental health charities<a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/\"> Mind </a>and <a href=\"http://www.rethink.org/\">Rethink Mental Illness </a>have produced a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlL53AyQzP4\">video</a> explaining more about mental illness discrimination and how you can support the proposed mental health (discrimination) bill. </p> <p>That and some consideration before you describe your busy weekend as mental, would go some way to reduce mental illness stigma. I don't think I'm crazy to think that would be a good thing.</p> <p><em>Dave Steele's inanity (I said INANITY!) can be further witnessed via his Twitter account, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hullodave\">@hullodave</a></em></p>",
  "<p>One of the things I love about my job \u2013 as an outdoor educator and trainer \u2013 is hearing the stories of what happens to the children and adults when teaching and learning outside. </p> <p>Everyone who works in the forest school world, from the early years sector through to further education, has profound stories. There are tales of shy children who have blossomed, aggressive children who have calmed down and teaching staff who have been being surprised by a student's abilities.</p> <p>After attending a two day workshop on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_schools\">forest school pedagogy</a> - a form of outdoor education - a teacher wrote to me recounting her experience. She works at a pupil referral unit, with some of the most disengaged young men in the county. As you can imagine, they come to her with a huge range of social, emotional and academic difficulties and they are not easy to teach. She has given me permission to share her email:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After last weekend, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I might improve the experience the group from the pupil referral unit are having in their time with me. I was particularly struck by what you said about some people having missed out on that vital play development stage early in life. I wanted to incorporate play into the next session without the 15 year olds feeling they were being treated as children.</p> <p>I made some fairly simple changes to the session format, doing pretty similar activities to those we'd done previously, but encouraging a more playful approach. I tried to build into the session as much as I could of the spirit of the forest school approach - allowing myself to be led by the learners.</p> <p>The results were remarkable. Not that the previous sessions were bad, but this time I finally felt that the young people and adult helpers were on the same side, the increased freedom relaxed everybody and the young people did actually unselfconsciously play.</p> <p>We made catapults and tried to shoot my toy squirrel out of a tree, made shelters and did a bit of tree work too. The hardest part was keeping the adult helpers from stepping in too soon and helping. </p> <p>In previous sessions the group have tended to ask, frequently, \"when is it time to light the Kelly kettles?\" always keen to move on to the next thing. But<br>this time I had to stop them for lunch, they would have happily continued what they were doing for longer had time permitted. Their support workers were standing beside me saying things like: \"Wow, I've never seen him do so much\" and \"I'm stunned that this is actually working.\"</p> <p>At the end of the session I pass around my hat and we all drop in our name badges and say a few words about the day \u2013 it's supposed to be a time of reflection. The young people have previously complained about this part and have never said anything when it's their turn, leaving just the adults to comment. But this time when they had the hat they all said they'd enjoyed the session - one young man actually asked for the hat back as he'd forgotten to mention something he particularly enjoyed.</p> <p>Result. Thanks. </p> </blockquote> <p>So, what happens when we go outside that makes it different from learning in the classroom?</p> <p>Even though we may still have specific learning objectives in mind, the lesson becomes less formal, less teacher-led. Outdoor lessons naturally incorporate more movement, more sensory stimulation, more co-operation and talk but the lessons tend to have a slower feel. Is this anathema in our educational era of rigor and pace? Well, maybe. But so be it.</p> <p>In my experience teachers and pupils need time and space in the week to slow down, to reflect and interact with the world at nature's pace \u2013 slow and steady. Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare? We shouldn't be herding our children along the track to the finishing line.</p> <p>Learning in this environment gives students an appreciation and love of the natural world. If delivered professionally and sympathetically, outdoor lessons enable children to make connections to and within the environment. Given time, this leads them towards a profound recognition of their impact on the world. They understand, for example, not just how bees pollinate flowers but that for us to enjoy good food we are reliant on pollinators. Likewise, they see how resources are not limitless, by using cuttings from trees on their site, for example. But they also learn that there are ways in which we manage and sustain these resources. </p> <p>As these children will be the town planners, politicians, farmers, consumers, business leaders and so on of the future, their understanding of environmental issues has a significance for us all. I think we should make it a priority that they understand green issues not just intellectually but also at this deeper, intuitive level.</p> <p>One final thought. I am reminded of a year 6 boy who spent a morning with me playing with mud, picking it up, allowing it to drip through his fingers, smearing it on trees, carrying it around, showing it to people. \"Look at my mud,\" he repeated, with wonderment on his face.</p> <p>His teacher contacted me several weeks later. This pupil had written a story in which the main character is transformed into a mud monster.</p> <p>\"I have no doubt,\" she wrote, \"that the impetus for this story was the morning he spent with you and the sensations he experienced. His use of descriptive language in this story is way beyond what I would usually expect of him. I am now planning regular sessions for the children in my class to be outside so that they can be inspired by the natural world.\"</p> <p>Result, indeed.</p> <p><em>Having spent 20 years in the primary and early years sector, Jo Ling is currently working as a freelance outdoor educator. She left mainstream education in December 2010, her last post as an assistant head teacher. She now works with schools, preschools, family groups and charities in promoting outdoor learning.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Planes launched into the skies by catapults running on green energy, then cruising efficiently in self-organised flocks across oceans and continents. That is the kind of blue-skies thinking, <a href=\"http://www.airbus.com/innovation/future-by-airbus/\" title=\"\">outlined by Airbus on Thursday</a>, that the aviation industry argues will allow an unrestrained increase in flying with no great increase in carbon emissions.</p> <p>The realisation of these and other measures, such as biofuels and more efficient jet engines, is key in determining whether the UK could build new runways in the south-east and at Heathrow \u2013 a question in the spotlight after a cabinet reshuffle this week that seems to make it clear the government would like to \u2013 while keeping its commitment to tackling global warming. The other question is how much of the nation's future emissions, which will need to be cut severely to meet legally binding climate targets, are allotted to flying.</p> <p>The aviation industry is bullish. \"We think we can definitely decouple growth in aviation \u2013 and all the benefits that brings \u2013 from the growth in emissions, and the benefits of that,\" said Matt Gorman, the director of sustainability at Heathrow owner BAA and chair of the <a href=\"http://www.sustainableaviation.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sustainable Aviation Council</a> (SAC), which represents over 90% of UK airlines and airports.</p> <p>On past trends, the number of air passenger is set to rise by 250% by 2050, according to the Department of Transport. The <a href=\"http://www.sustainableaviation.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Road-Map-PressRelease-FINAL.docx\" title=\"\">SAC's 2012 roadmap</a> argues that virtually all of the extra greenhouse gases that would be emitted by this rise can be cut by a combination of sleeker aircraft, leaner engines, smoother ground operations, more direct flight paths and up to 40% use of biofuels in global aviation. The roadmap goes even further, suggesting that the use of carbon trading would mean aviation's current carbon footprint could be halved even if passenger numbers more than doubled.</p> <p>But environmental campaigners are scornful of the industry's vision. \"The roadmap is wishful thinking in the extreme,\" said Jean Leston, a transport expert at WWF-UK. \"We are being sold a lot of promises that are not being met. The measures may cut emissions by a few per cent, but the demand for flying is going up far faster. They should not be allowed to expand until it has demonstrated these efficiencies can be achieved.\"</p> <p>Greens note that <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/sectors/aviation/emissions-projections\" title=\"\">aviation is the fastest growing source of carbon emissions</a> in the UK and that Britons have had the highest flying footprint of any nation. They also point to scientific evidence that the <a href=\"http://downloads.theccc.org.uk/Aviation%20Report%2009/21667B%20CCC%20Chapter%206.pdf\" title=\"\">impact of carbon pollution emitted at high altitude is far higher</a> than that at ground level, meaning the 5% of national emissions caused by aviation result in more than 10% of the country's contribution to global warming.</p> <p>However, a new way of dealing with aviation's emissions has emerged since January with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/15/eu-airline-emissions-tax-success\" title=\"\">inclusion of the sector in the European Union's emissions trading scheme</a> (ETS), which caps the continent's output of climate-warming gases. According to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/aviation/9501875/Heathrow-expansion-A-third-runway-must-be-cleared-for-take-off.html\" title=\"\">supporters of new runways</a>, this means any increase in pollution from extra planes and runways will be offset by cuts in other industries.</p> <p>But environmentalists say aircraft emissions cannot be airbrushed away through carbon trading. \"You are asking for future emissions for short-haul flights to take priority over heating peoples' homes \u2013 that is not a strong argument,\" said Joss Garman, former co-founder of campaign group <a href=\"http://www.planestupid.com/\" title=\"\">Plane Stupid</a> and now at Greenpeace. \"Given a new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/17/dash-for-gas-proposals-campaigners\" title=\"\">dash for gas</a> in the UK, new road building and then more aviation, at some point you have to ask where are the cuts needed actually going to come from?\" Garman also warned that building new runways creates a lock-in effect, meaning high emissions for decades to come. \"Once it is built, you will want to use it.\"</p> <p>Rob Elsworth, policy officer at carbon trading thinktank <a href=\"http://www.sandbag.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Sandbag</a>, said: \"There is an element of truth in the argument that under emissions trading aviation will have to pay for its pollution. But the major problem is that the ETS is not functioning well, as there are a billion tonnes of spare permits, and making the ETS effective is an extremely long-term process, dogged by political lack of will and the complexities of Europe's current economic situation.\"</p> <p>Even BAA's Gorman acknowledges difficulties in the ETS: \"It is still very early days for aviation in the ETS and it is inevitable that there will be some learning and improvements. But that does not undermine the basis of the policy.\"</p> <p>The most authoritative and independent analysis of whether more flying is possible without breaking the UK's climate change commitments comes from the government's official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). The CCC creates carbon budgets \u2013 the amount of carbon the country can emit in a five year period and keep to its climate targets \u2013 based on the lowest cost methods.</p> <p>It concluded that <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/reports/aviation-report\" title=\"\">passenger numbers could increase by 60% by 2050</a> \u2013 a rise that would require new runways, though the CCC has no opinion on where they are sited \u2013 while still cutting total national emissions by 80%. That increase is far lower than the government forecasts of a 250% rise in passenger numbers, but higher than some environmentalists argue is possible.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://wwf.org.uk/UKairportcapacityreport\" title=\"\">report by WWF-UK and the Aviation Environment Federation</a>, claims that such a 60% rise could be achieved without any new runways being built at all. \"Twenty per cent of flights out of Heathrow could easily be replaced by train travel,\" said Leston. \"But airlines do not want that, as they would lose that source of income.\"</p> <p>The CCC's target would mean almost a quarter of the nation's emissions in 2050 would come from aviation. David Kennedy, CCC chief executive, said: \"We can fully decarbonise electricity, heating and ground transport through electrification, but we can't fully decarbonise aviation. So should we not use [a significant portion of our carbon budget] for something we value highly like flying?\"</p> <p>The CCC describes the industry's 25-40% target for biofuels as \"speculative\", stating that 10% is far more likely. \"If you take all the waste in the world you can turn into biofuel and all the land that might be available and then use that fuel in the most economic way, there is not a lot left over for aviation,\" said Kennedy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/mar/16/aviation-biofuel-british-airways-carbon\" title=\"\">British Airways's plan</a> to turn half a million tonnes of Londoner's household rubbish into 50,000 tonnes a year of jet fuel from 2015 will provide 2% of the fuel it uses.</p> <p>The argument over aviation and climate change in 2007 became focused on the \"totemic\" issue of the planned third runway at Heathrow, according to Kennedy. \"That runway became associated with the idea that you cannot fly in a carbon-constrained world, but the answer is you can fly and fly a bit more than now. But what you can't have is unfettered growth.\"</p> <p>The UK's aviation industry rejects this, by arguing that a 250% rise in passengers can be achieved in a low-carbon way. \"Growth in aviation and tackling climate change are compatible,\" said Gorman.</p> <p>On the other side, Greenpeace's Garman said: \"It is ultimately about what type of economic growth you want to have. Do you want to build a low-carbon transport system or new aviation capacity that is inherently unsustainable?\"</p>",
  "<p>The creation of Europe's economic and monetary union is unique in the history of sovereign states. The eurozone constitutes a \"society of states\" of a completely new type, one that transcends the traditional Westphalian concept of sovereignty.</p> <p>Like individuals in a society, eurozone countries are both independent and interdependent. They can affect each other both positively and negatively. Good governance requires that individual member states and the European Union's institutions fulfil their responsibilities. Above all, economic and monetary union means just that: two unions, monetary and economic.</p> <p>Europe's monetary union has worked remarkably well. Since the euro's launch in 1999, price stability has been maintained for 17 countries and 332 million people, with average yearly inflation of just 2.03% \u2013 better than Germany's record from 1955 to 1999. Moreover, the eurozone has created 14.5m new jobs since 1999, compared with 8.5-9m in the United States. This is not to say that Europe does not have a serious unemployment problem, but there is no obvious inferiority in Europe: all advanced economies must boost job creation.</p> <p>Likewise, on a consolidated basis, the eurozone's current account is balanced, its debt/GDP ratio is well below that of Japan, and its annual public-finance deficit is well below that of the US, Japan and the United Kingdom.</p> <p>The euro per se thus does not explain why the eurozone has become the sick man of the global economy. To understand that, one has to consider the weakness of Europe's economic union.</p> <p>For starters, the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), intended to ensure sound fiscal policies in the eurozone, was never correctly implemented. On the contrary, in 2003 and 2004, France, Italy and Germany sought to weaken it. The European commission, the European Central Bank and the small and medium-sized eurozone countries prevented the SGP from being dismantled, but its spirit was gravely compromised.</p> <p>Moreover, eurozone governance did not include monitoring and surveillance of competitiveness indicators \u2013 trends in nominal prices and costs in member states, and countries' external imbalances within the eurozone. (In 2005, long before the crisis, I called, on behalf of the ECB's governing council, for appropriate surveillance of a number of national indicators, including unit labour costs.)</p> <p>A third source of weakness is that no crisis-management tools were envisaged at the euro's launch. For much of the world at the time, \"benign neglect\" was the order of the day, particularly in the advanced economies.</p> <p>Finally, the high correlation between the creditworthiness of a particular country's commercial banks and that of its government creates an additional source of vulnerability, which is particularly damaging in the eurozone.</p> <p>Fortunately, much progress has been made, including significant improvements to the SGP and the introduction of surveillance of competitiveness indicators and national imbalances. New crisis-management tools have been put in place. And there is a consensus that the EU's stability and prosperity require completion of the single market and obligatory structural reforms for all 27 members. A proposed banking union would help to separate the commercial banks' creditworthiness from that of their governments.</p> <p>But none of this is enough. Instead of imposing fines on countries that transgress rules and ignore recommendations, as the SGP was supposed to do, the European commission, the European council and \u2013 this is essential \u2013 the European parliament should decide directly on measures to be immediately implemented in the country concerned. Fiscal and certain other economic policies should be subject to activation of a eurozone \"federation by exception\".</p> <p>The idea that sharing a single currency also means accepting limitations on fiscal sovereignty is not new. A \"federation by exception\" merely draws the logical consequences from the ineffectiveness of the fines envisaged by the SGP, and is fully consistent with the concept of subsidiarity that has been applied since the SGP's introduction: as long as national economic policy complies with the framework, there are no sanctions.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important element of the \"federation by exception\" would be its strong democratic anchor. Its activation would be subject to a fully democratic decision-making process, with clear political accountability. More precisely, decisions to implement measures proposed by the commission and already approved by the council would require a majority vote by the European parliament \u2013 that is, those representatives elected from the EU's eurozone members.</p> <p>In such exceptional circumstances, the parliament of the country concerned should have the opportunity to explain to the European parliament why it could not implement the recommendations proposed, while the European parliament could explain why the eurozone's stability and prosperity are at stake. But the final word would belong to the European parliament.</p> <p>In the past, I have suggested establishing a eurozone finance ministry, which would be responsible for activating economic and fiscal federation when and where necessary, and for managing new crisis-management tools like the European Stability Mechanism. It would also be responsible for overseeing the banking union, and it would represent the eurozone in all international financial institutions and informal groupings.</p> <p>But, most important, \"federation by exception\" would ultimately cease to be an exception. The finance minister would be a member of the EU's future executive branch, together with the other ministers responsible for other federal departments.</p> <p>From this perspective, the commission presages a future European democratic government, as German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who has proposed instituting an elected president, has suggested. The council, meanwhile, appears to anticipate the European parliament's future upper house, with the lower house already elected by all EU citizens.</p> <p>I am fully aware of the boldness of what I propose. But Europeans must learn the lessons of the recent past. We must clarify the nature of what must be done to secure governance that is both democratic and as effective as circumstances require.</p> <p>\u2022 Jean-Claude Trichet, a member of the board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements, was president of the European Central Bank 2003-2011 and president of the Bank of France 1993-2003.</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012</p>",

  "<h2>BY FAR THE GREATEST MANAGING DIRECTOR THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN</h2> <p>It's been a successful week for Liverpool moneyman Ian Ayre. Last Friday, he managed to hide in the stationery cupboard all day without once being found by Brendan Rodgers, who kept poking his head round the office door in an increasingly agitated fashion, babbling incoherently about Americans and wishing he was still at bloody Reading never mind Swansea. \"Tee hee!\" giggled Ian. \"I was in the stationery cupboard all along!\" At 9pm, he managed to bolt out of the door at high speed without anybody noticing, which meant the only movement in the Anfield office during the last crucial couple of hours of the transfer window was his empty chair spinning around and several sheets of paper slowly wafting back down on to his desk. As a result of hiding in the cupboard and then knocking off early for a pint, he didn't have to write a single cheque all day. \"Guffaw!\" he guffawed, \"John W and the other bloke will be right happy with me.\" Not only that, while in the cupboard he did a quick audit of pens, staples, notepads and the like, and he'll be cutting back on Post-It notes over the next couple of months too, which should save a few more pennies and no mistake.</p> <p>The following day, Andy Carroll, who had been bundled in the back of a cart and dispatched to Big Sam's Glue Factory, turned up on the telly, pictured taking part in all three goals for West Ham United. \"Hoo hoooo,\" chortled Ian, \"if he keeps going at this rate, I'll be able to use my negotiating skills next summer to secure a bumper \u00a31.5m permanent deal for the big galoot!\" At which point, giddy with achievement, he jumped on a plane to Indonesia, where he agreed a three-year partnership which will see the country's flag carrier Garuda Indonesia become Liverpool FC's official global airline, ensuring Garuda will be granted 12 30-second slots on Anfield's advertising hoardings every match. \"It is an honour for us to co-operate with Garuda,\" said Ayre, gleefully inking a deal which is the modern equivalent of selling a quarter-page ad in the club programme to a local plumber.</p> <p>But all good runs come to an end eventually, as Anfield regulars who enjoyed their team's recent heady one-draw-in-a-row sequence will attest. And it appears Liverpool's successful offloading of Italian waste of money and precious time Alberto Aquilani to Fiorentina wasn't quite as beneficial to the Reds' bottom line as first thought. The clue? Fiorentina are boasting about the deal in the loud fashion. Liverpool had already taken a significant hit on their initial investment of \u00a316m, but now it sounds like they've had to stump up a few extra beans to keep the player happy too. \"The most difficult operation of the summer was the one with Liverpool for Aquilani, who had a salary impractical for Fiorentina and perhaps all the other clubs,\" explained Viola sporting director Daniele Prade today. \"We resolved it along with Liverpool, our good relations paid off,\" he added, those final two words perhaps being the operative ones for poor old Ian, who might now have to consider cutting back on the staples too. If only to make staying in the stationery cupboard more comfortable, with avoiding Brendan during January very much in mind.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"We lost because of him\" \u2013 man-management's Paolo Di Canio takes Swindon's defeat to A420 foes Oxford in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy in typically good natured fashion, substitute Aden Flint this time getting the treatment.</p> <h2>GET A FREE \u00a325 BET WITH BLUE SQUARE</h2> <p><a href=\"http://ads.bluesq.com/redirect.aspx?pid=5296&amp;bid=2932\" title=\"\">Step one: open an account with Blue Square and deposit any amount; step two: place a bet of at least \u00a35 on any sport; step three: we will match your bet with a free bet of up to \u00a325</a>.</p> <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\"The Fiver knows less about Keynesian economics than Steve Kean-out does about his signings (yesterday's Bits and Bobs)?

  "<p>A new $6.4bn funding package has been announced to try to tackle the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/mar/14/yemen-crisis-emergency-food-aid\" title=\"\">deepening humanitarian crisis</a> in Yemen that has pushed 10 million people into chronic hunger.</p> <p>A meeting of donors in Saudi Arabia this week, led by the British government, finalised the package of support after months of negotiation. The money will go towards underpinning the flagging Yemeni economy and funding new infrastructure projects, as well as immediately addressing the humanitarian situation.</p> <p>With 58% of children under the age of five experiencing chronic malnutrition, Yemen has the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/22/tackle-malnutrition-yemen-unicef\" title=\"\">second highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world</a>, behind Afghanistan.</p> <p>The UK will contribute \u00a3196m (around $311m) between 2012 and 2015. Most will go towards protecting 2 million women and children from hunger and delivering short-term humanitarian assistance, which will provide 300,000 people with emergency food assistance and 170,000 with essential health services. Other donors include Saudi Arabia, which has pledged $3.2bn, the US and the World Bank, which pledged an extra US$400m to its existing $700m programme over the coming two years.</p> <p>It is hoped the emergency funding will help stabilise Yemen's faltering economy and its volatile security situation, which donors described as being on the \"brink of a slide into instability\".</p> <p>\"For the first time ever for Yemen, donors have come together to say in detail what they are going to do to help, how they will do it, and when they will deliver their aid, an effort to which Saudi Arabia has given the most,\" says Alan Duncan, UK international development minister.</p> <p>\"Over the last few months, we've put together a package of support which will underpin the Yemeni economy, direct funds into infrastructure, and will urgently address Yemenis' basic needs, such as healthcare, education and access to sanitation.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/yemen\" title=\"\">Yemen has the highest poverty levels </a>in the Middle East and the humanitarian crisis that has engulfed the country has been exacerbated by years of conflict and violence. Last year, president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/23/yemen-president-quits\" title=\"\">Ali Abdullah Saleh was ousted from power</a> after 33 years and was replaced by President Abd-Rabbu Masour Hadi, but the country continues to be marred by violence as the government and Islamic militants wrestle for control of areas of the south.</p> <p>Oxfam has welcomed the funding, saying the money will make a real difference to the lives of the 10 million Yemenis without enough to eat.</p> <p>\"Yemen is in the midst of a catastrophic hunger crisis,\" says Colette Fearon, Oxfam's country director in Yemen. \"The government of Yemen has estimated that the current crisis has pushed back Yemen's development by a decade. We welcome the UK's leadership on this issue and urge more donors to step forward and help Yemen tackle its humanitarian crisis. All donors need to ensure that pledges of money get to the ground immediately.\"</p> <p>Ginny Hill, an analyst focusing on Yemen at thinktank <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org/\" title=\"\">Chatham House</a>, said the funding was a step towards ensuring that donors took a more effective and co-ordinated approach to tackling Yemen's humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>\"In 2006, there was a similar pledge from donors, yet very little of the money was ever spent and this time around it is vitally important that the funding gets allocated and close attention is made to monitoring how it is spent,\" she said. \"This new funding is testament to the development of better working relationships with Gulf donors over the past few years, and it seems that the potential is now there to develop a much more effective response to getting urgent assistance into the country.\"</p> <p>\u0095 This article was amended on 7 September 2012.

  "<p>King Solomon used them in the construction of the temple that would bear his name, the Phoenicians used them to build their merchant ships and the ancient Egyptians used their resin in the mummification process. But now Lebanon's cedar trees (<em>Cedrus libani</em>), described in the Scriptures as \"the glory of Lebanon\" and by the 19th-century French Romantic poet, Alphonse de Lamartine, as \"the most famous natural monuments in the world\", face a new threat in the form of climate change.</p> <p>Emblazoned on the national flag, currency and the country's national airline, the cedar is the one great unifying emblem of this small Mediterranean nation. Centuries of deforestation have already seen the tree's 500,000 hectares decimated to its current 2,000 hectares, <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/42305/0\" title=\"\">and has been added to the IUCN's red list of threatened species</a>, albeit at the lowest level of threat.</p> <p>The cedars, some up to 3,000 years old and almost all of which are now protected, need a minimum amount of snow and rain for natural regeneration. But global warming has meant Lebanon's cedars being subjected to shorter winters and less snow, and the Lebanese government estimates that snow cover could be cut by 40% by 2040.</p> <p>Dr Nabil Nemer, the head of the agricultural sciences department at <a href=\"http://www.usek.edu.lb/en/\" title=\"\">Lebanon's Holy Spirit University of Kaslik</a>, said that the lack of snow was not the only problem linked to climate change. \"Insects, due to the changing climatic condition, become more active and their development rate is faster thus causing more outbreaks, which weaken the cedar tree making them more susceptible to other diseases and/or insects, which will ultimately kill the trees. At least one insect has been studied and the results showed that outbreaks of this insect are due to climate change, a low period of snow and low humidity in summer. This insect, the <em>Cephalcia tannourinensis</em>, is a serious cedar tree defoliator.\"</p> <p>But, with sectarian difficulties forever dominating the political agenda, the fight to preserve Lebanon's cedars can be a frustrating one. Nemer, who is also project co-ordinator of Support to Nature Reserves of Lebanon, said that while the Lebanese government was concerned about the threat to its emblem, not enough was being done to stop deforestation and plant new cedars. \"Whether what is being done is enough \u2013 it is enough when you see the number of groups involved and it is not enough when you observe what is done, how it is done and by whom.\"</p> <p>Dr Elsa Sattout, whose PhD entailed a multidisciplinary study of Lebanon's cedar forests, defended the country's approach and noted the cedar is protected by law, but said more could be done.</p> <p>\"There are many reforestation projects undertaken by non-governmental organisations and funded by international agencies, which have and are taking place, but, for me, these could have been more successful.\" Since 2009, for example, Starbucks and the Association for Forest Development and Conservation have partnered to plant several thousand cedars in areas of Lebanon afflicted by forest fires.</p> <p>She also highlighted a mass spraying project against <em>Cephalcia tannourinensis</em> in a joint effort between the American University of Beirut and the ministries of agriculture and environment.</p> <p>.</p> <p>A spokesman from the country's Lebanese agricultural ministry told the Guardian: \"When, for example, the threat of the <em>Cephalcia tannourinensis</em> was discovered in the Tannourine nature reserve we had experts from France to assess the danger and they suggested the insecticide to use, which we dropped using helicopters and were successful in drawing an environmental balance \u2013 and keeping the insect at bay. The cedars are our treasure and we need to preserve this treasure for many hundreds and thousands of years to come.\"</p>",
  "<p>Blue skies, 40F temperatures, swirling green northern lights at night and old snow on the hills of northern Norway. The Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise spent Wednesday restocking in Troms\u00f8 harbour, but is now heading north, as far as possibly can.</p> <p>The plan is to steam to, and possibly then into, the furthest extent of the annual sea ice which right now is about 82-84 degrees north, about 500km from the north pole. Given good weather that's at least four days away in this much loved 37 year-old-tub. At least it's an ice breaker.</p> <p>But such is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">the record annual sea ice melt this year</a>, it is not clear where the ice will be in a week's time, or when it will stop melting and start refreezing. Usually it starts to reform around 12 September, but it has been as late as 20 September.</p> <p>This year's melt has not just already broken recent records, it has comprehensively smashed them. The National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), based in Boulder, Colorado, <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/08/arctic-sea-ice-breaks-2007-record-extent/\" title=\"\">says it passed the 2007 record minimum extent of 4.17m sq kilometres on 26 August</a>.</p> <p>But satellite imagery shows a further 370,000 sq km has melted since then and now just 3.64m sq km remains. <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/09/arctic-sea-ice-falls-below-4-million-square-kilometers/\" title=\"\">Data this week shows</a> the rate of melt slowing but the ice still losing 40,000 sq km a day. Cryologists [ice experts] talk of it possibly dropping below 3m sq km for the first time in possibly tens of thousands of years. If so, it would be a whopping 25% below <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\" title=\"\">the 2007 record minimum extent</a> and something that few ice experts ever thought could happen in their lifetimes.</p> <p>There's a sense of history unfolding, of heading into uncharted territory. And, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/met-office-arctic-sea-ice-loss-winter\" title=\"\">because the Arctic ice is thought to largely regulate climate in the northern hemisphere</a>, of unknown consequences.</p> <p>Some folk \u2013 though not on the Arctic Sunrise where pragmatism strictly rules \u2013 <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/09/05/799761/death-spiral-watch-experts-warn-near-ice-free-arctic-in-summer-in-a-decade-volume-trends-continue/\" title=\"\">are calling it a \"death spiral\"</a>, leading to ice-free summer waters within 20-30 years. The climate sceptics shrug the latest statistics off as just one more of many scares but the fact is that the decline of sea ice has faithfully mirrored the seeming inexorable rise in temperatures seen across the Arctic in recent years.</p> <p>The chances of the ice now melting way, way beyond anything expected this year are heightened by what is happening in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptev_Sea\" title=\"\">Laptev Sea</a> north of Siberia. Here, the ice is thin and already vulnerable. A low pressure system, it seems, is building there, which could bring on another major storm which in turn would break the ice pack up and make it more prone to melt. In a matter of a few days, hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of ice could disappear.</p> <p>There are now three ice scientists aboard, including Julienne Stroeve, a researcher with the NSIDC, and two from Cambridge university. They will each be conducting their own experiments and observations.</p> <p>Strove shows us data sets showing how vulnerable large parts of the ice mass has become. Ten years ago, she says, a good 30-40% was older than a year, meaning it was thicker and more resilient. This year it's nearly all only one year old. Even more remarkably, she shows us the temperature anomaly charts \u2013 much of this vast region is presently 2-6C above normal temperatures for this time of year.</p> <p>\"To see the ice disappear like this so quickly is unprecedented. I was around in 2002 when there was a jump. But it has just kept happening. Something has changed,\" she says.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/david-cameron-government-reshuffle-cabinet\" title=\"\">cabinet reshuffle</a> can always be counted on to provide drama, tension and intrigue, and David Cameron's reshuffle of his government was no exception. This political shifting was significant not just because of what it says about coalition politics but also because the new team will have to demonstrate that they are able to deliver on growth against a backdrop of ongoing global economic downturn and a looming general election.</p> <p>One decision that failed to make the headlines but is of significance to the higher education sector, was the decision to keep David Willetts as the minister of state for universities and science. Like many others in the sector, the University Alliance office were glued to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search/willetts%20%20%23reshuffle\" title=\"\">Twitter</a> to discover who would be given the responsibility of overseeing universities. Once the announcement was made, we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UniAlliance/status/243266221942927360\" title=\"\">uttered a sigh of relief</a> which was shared by many in the sector. But why are we happy with the prime minister's decision?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidwilletts\" title=\"\">David Willetts</a> has held the universities brief since 2007, first in opposition and then, since 2010, in government. While we have not always agreed with the decisions made by the coalition government, Willetts has proven himself to be a strong, knowledgeable and passionate advocate for higher education.</p> <p>Reshuffles can often prove a master stroke. They can bring in fresh and innovative ideas and a new sense of enthusiasm, but they can also usher in a period of great uncertainty. At a time of significant change for the higher education sector, having some certainty is welcomed by students and institutions alike. This continuity will provide stability for universities as they adapt to the new funding system while simultaneously ensuring students receive the high quality education that they deserve.</p> <p><strong>Keeping universities at the heart of growth</strong></p> <p>The other good news from the the reshuffle was that the university brief was to stay in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (<a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">BIS</a>). Universities belong in BIS, at the heart of the government department charged with driving growth in the UK. Universities play a crucial role in the economic and social wellbeing of the country through securing our economic future and transforming the lives of those that interact with them. Improving competitiveness, high-level skills and thinking of new and creative approaches have always been crucial to business success and growth - and is central to the BIS portfolio. Higher education institutions are key to unlocking this hidden potential and BIS is best placed to help support and strengthen the collaborations that already exist between universities and business.</p> <p>Of course, as the dust settles after the reshuffle, the same concerns and challenges remain. There is the fundamental question of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/jun/13/tuition-fees-drop-in-student-numbers\" title=\"\">student numbers</a> that has been left untouched for too long - in part by the sector itself. How do we increase the number of graduates who are able to meet the needs of our changing, global economy? Tackling this issue will always take us back to the funding debate. In essence, we have a system that is incredibly expensive for government in terms of the upfront payment of fees and subsidies, making it unsustainable in the medium to long-term. The consequence of this is that the UK is the only OECD country reducing the number of places available at university at a time when all evidence suggests we need to better equip our workforce if we are going to innovate and grow our way out of this difficult economic climate (see our report <a href=\"http://www.unialliance.ac.uk/site/2012/03/27/the-way-well-work-labour-market-trends-and-preparing-for-the-hourglass/\" title=\"\">The way we'll work</a>).</p> <p>It is important that in the face of change and uncertainty we continue to focus on the long-term, setting out our vision for a strong, diverse and internationally acclaimed higher education sector. We look forward to continuing to work with Willetts to do this longer-term thinking and to ensure that universities remain one of the UK's great success stories.</p> <p><em>Libby Hacket is the chief executive of the </em><a href=\"http://www.unialliance.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University Alliance</em></a><em>, the organisation representing business-facing universities</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The largest African-American theatre company in the US has suspended its artistic output and cut its full-time workforce by more than a third on account of a cash crisis.</p> <p>According to the Star Tribune, <a href=\"http://penumbratheatre.org/content/blogcategory/21/43/\" title=\"\">Penumbra Theatre</a>, a 250-seater in St Paul, Minnesota, has laid off six of its 16 full-time members, including its associate artistic director, <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/168704686.html\" title=\"\">in a bid to reduce its annual budget by $800,000 (\u00a3502,850)</a>. While the company hope to raise the funds for a musical in March \u2013 reportedly $340,000 \u2013 they will not programme any new work in the interim.</p> <p>Artistic director <a href=\"http://penumbratheatre.org/content/view/49/14/\" title=\"\">Lou Bellamy</a> told the paper that the company, which he founded in 1976, was facing \"an immediate cash-flow challenge\", after incurring a shortfall of $500,000 last year, despite a 35% increase in ticket revenue.</p> <p>As a result, Penumbra has already <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/135139333.html?refer=y\" title=\"\">cancelled two productions due this year</a>, Kara Lee Cothron's Julius By Design and Pearl Clage's Bourbon at the Border, saving around $350,000. When the cancellations were announced, managing director Chris Widdess said that the remainder of the shortfall would be made up \"through other cuts\".</p> <p>Penumbra is one of only three professional African-American theatre companies in the US to offer a full season of performances, and was <a href=\"http://penumbratheatre.org/content/view/48/14/\" title=\"\">once the primary artistic home of twice Pulitzer prize-winning dramatist August Wilson</a>.

  "<p>A professor who claims he was fired from his job at New York University after giving James Franco a \"D\" is to sue his former student for defamation.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Angel Santana, who is already engaged in legal action against his former employer, has now filed a civil action in the Manhattan supreme court over comments Franco made labelling his classes \"awful\". He says he handed out the low grade because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137863/127-hours\" title=\"\">127 Hours</a> star attended just two out of his 14 scheduled directing classes.</p> <p>\"Whoever was in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\" title=\"\">Clint Eastwood's chair at the Republican national convention</a> was more present than Mr Franco was in my classes,\" Santana told the New York Post. <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/zzzz_money_GpWMiEBVLr9hGLrZFrYgiM?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost\" title=\"\">\"[Franco] uses the bully pulpit of his celebrity to punish anyone who doesn't do his bidding.\"</a></p> <p>The offending comments were made during interviews for Franco's film The Broken Tower in April. He told reporters Santana was \"awful,\" adding: \"I didn't feel like I needed to waste my time with a bad teacher.\"</p> <p>\"No teacher will ever be fired from NYU for giving a student a D,\" added the actor. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/james-franco-explains-why-skipped-nyu-class_n_1428281.html#s268292&amp;title=UCLA\" title=\"\">\"He wasn't fired, he was asked not to come back after three years because they didn't think he was a good teacher. He is not going to be hired at another institution.\" </a></p> <p>But Santana, who has been been a teacher since 1979 and was earning $70,000 (\u00a344,000) prior to being let go by the university, said he had \"overwhelmingly positive student evaluations\". He said: \"I didn't deserve to be on the receiving end of those falsehoods. I was outraged that someone with his attendance record at NYU had the audacity to make those statements.\"</p> <p>Santana, who taught as an assistant arts professor on the actor's graduate film course, also said he was simply doing his job by handing Franco a low grade, in contrast with other professors, who \"bent over backwards to create a Franco-friendly environment\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/20/james-franco-lawsuit-nyu-professor\" title=\"\">The teacher filed a lawsuit against New York University</a> in December 2011 in protest at his dismissal, claiming that Franco received good grades from his former colleagues despite similar levels of absence from their lectures. These, Santana alleged, were in return for the publicity the actor's enrolment brought the school and because the actor had collaborated with faculty members on independent film projects.</p>",

Olivia Nixon, responding to news that doctors have developed a new blood test that is more accurate and safer for babies, has <a href=\"http://livvi1205.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/httpwww.html\">written a plea to the NHS</a>. She says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a medical hat on I can see that yes, any advancement in medicine is always a positive thing on some level, and giving mothers to be the chance to screen without risking miscarriage is, I suppose, as the article above states, 'exciting' and a 'major advance'. True. But speak to any parent of a child with Down's Syndrome and this sort of screening is being deemed to be the beginning of the end for children with Down's Syndrome. Which is most definitely NOT a major advance. There are so many myths around D/S. People believe a child with special needs would be a drain on their family, or take their attention away from their 'normal' children. They believe it takes a special type of person to be able to raise a child with special needs. Well that's just bull. My little boy does nothing but bring me complete utter joy in every imaginable way. I feel pride every second of the day, so much so sometimes I feel I could burst. I'm not a special type of person... I'm just a mum.</p> </blockquote> <p>And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>please NHS, let's start offering parents to be some real constructive advice around having a child with special needs. It isn't any more draining or challenging than having any other child. It's just parenting, pure and simple, and it's driven by love. </p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 New research by the <strong>drugs information service</strong> Frank, which reveals that <a href=\"http://www.talktofrank.com/content/%E2%80%9Civory-wave-benzo-fury-and-mdai%E2%80%9D-just-how-much-do-you-know-about-legal-highs\">parents have little knowledge of legal highs</a> - a fifth say they'd never heard the term, while three-quarters of parents of teenagers say they've never spoken to their children about legal highs.</p> <p>\u2022 Further thoughts on the <strong>cabinet reshuffle</strong> from Akash Paun for the Institute for Government blog, who writes that <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/4839/reshuffle-the-verdict/?source=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Publicsectorblogs+%28PublicSectorBlogs%29\">reshuffles can highlight a prime minister's weakness as much as his power</a>. He concludes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Judging the effectiveness of a reshuffle (especially the day after the event) is a difficult and perhaps pointless business. The process seemed to work fine, there was a logic if no grand strategy to the changes, and few noses were unnecessarily put out of joint. But the big challenges facing the government are the state of the economy, successful implementation of its major public service reforms, and growing tensions between Conservatives and Lib Dems. A quick game of cabinet musical chairs is unlikely to solve such huge issues, though these, ultimately, are the yardsticks against which the coalition will be judged.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>(thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davebriggs\">Dave Briggs</a> for the link)</p> <p>\u2022 Charity <strong>Mencap</strong>, which is tweeting details of the calls to its telephone helpline.

  "<p>For many years the first experiment undergraduate physics students arriving in Cambridge were required to do was to measure <em>g</em>, the acceleration due to gravity. This was, in principle, an easy experiment to do, the apparatus simple and the \"correct\" answer of 9.81 ms<sup>\u20132 </sup>known to each and every one of them.</p> <p>How could it go wrong? The catch was that they were asked to measure this quantity with an accuracy of 1 part in 1,000 \u2013 in other words, to get that second decimal place right. In practice, very few of them managed to get their experiments (using a compound pendulum) working that precisely. Values of over 10 ms<sup>\u20132</sup> were far from uncommon, although generally that was because they'd forgotten how to use a calculator because of the stress of the unfamiliar and daunting new surroundings; or maybe they'd been up all night getting to know their new college neighbours over a few drinks.</p> <p>The primary aim of the experiment was to teach the students about errors: where they turn up and their different manifestations. Since the experiment had intrinsically various sources of error, they also had to get to grips with how to deal with accounting for them all adequately; they needed to be able to estimate whether or not they had got close to the requested \"1 part in 1,000\" accuracy. It was combining the errors that used to throw the students more than anything else, leading to some of their answers being so wildly wrong.</p> <p>Beyond actually doing these calculations, the conceptual take-home message we wanted to convey was the difference between systematic and random errors, since these turn up all over the place \u2013 in practice way beyond the undergraduate physics laboratory.</p> <p>Random errors are the ones with which people tend to be familiar. In this particular experiment, involving timing the swing of a pendulum accurately, there is an obvious source of error arising from how fast your reflexes are and how accurately you can judge the precise moment at which to stop the stopwatch at the end of one swing. Timing over more swings reduces the contribution of this random error to the precision with which the fundamental quantity, the period of a single swing, can be determined. As long as the stopwatch is accurate, that should be that.</p> <p>But when it came to the distance measurements, all we supplied were crude wooden metre rules that were often rather beaten up by previous generations of students \u2013 maybe they were warped, maybe worn away at the ends so that the first millimetre was missing. In this case, as well as the random error, a systematic error could be present which, however many times they did the measurement and however meticulously, would lead to inaccuracy if not taken into account. These sorts of error are pernicious if not spotted; they are also depressingly common.</p> <p>The story about \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomaly\">faster than light neutrinos</a>\" earlier this year was a case in point. As soon as the Italian team published their apparently extraordinary results, admittedly with many warnings that they feared there might be an undetected problem with the data, everyone started looking for where a systematic error might lurk. </p> <p>It could have been in the measurement of the precise distance between the source of the neutrinos and the data collection point \u2013 a total distance of around 730km. If this distance had been mismeasured by a mere 20 metres (one part in 40,000), the result could have been rationalised. </p> <p>In fact the source of the problem turned out to be a combination of two electronic faults: a dodgy connection causing the time measured to be shorter than it should have been, partially compensated by the oscillator underpinning the timing ticking slightly too slowly, lengthening the time by a small amount. These two effects led to a small but ever-present error in the timing. Repeating the experiment many times made no difference, which was why the team were misled into believing the neutrinos really might be travelling faster than light. They felt they had checked everything carefully before they went public. In fact they hadn't. </p> <p>As I say, such systematic errors are pernicious and ubiquitous. In this case it also <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17560379\">cost the team leader his job</a>.</p> <p>But systematic errors turn up away from physics experiments in ways that can also trick the unwary. Academics and universities are constantly being \"measured\" in various ways. These measurements are as likely to be systematically inaccurate as any other, yet they can imply a spurious accuracy that can in turn affect both policy and funding. </p> <p>For instance, the distribution of money between university teaching and research is based in part on the responses from academics to a Time Analysis Survey. The aims are laudable, the motivations of academics no doubt equally so, and yet no one is actually going to sit down and attribute each moment of the day precisely; indeed it would be totally impracticable to do so. </p> <p>As a result, numbers are produced with random errors arising from uncertainty as to how different tasks fit under the different headings (of which there are many) and because it's hard to account accurately for exactly how long was spent on each. But there are also systematic errors present because (since we as academics don't count very precisely) we may round up and down in different ways for different tasks because of what we internally expect we should be doing.</p> <p>As for those frequent league tables ranking universities \u2013 within the UK or internationally \u2013 these have a different kind of systematic error in so far as you really have to read the small print to know what is actually being measured. As a result, with several newspapers producing their own ranking, it is possible for most Russell Group universities to be able to say they are in the top 10 in one list or the other. </p> <p>Internationally, one much quoted example \u2013 which university administrations may put much store by \u2013 is the <a href=\"http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=420861&amp;c=1\">Shanghai Jiao Tong</a>, a league table that is heavily weighted towards research. It includes factors such as the number of university Nobel prizewinners, but basically doesn't take into account the quality of teaching provided and other factors important to incoming students such as expenditure on libraries. It won't, therefore, be really very useful for an aspiring undergraduate to use. But they may well not appreciate that the things they care about are systematically absent, if they simply look at the headlines.</p> <p>My message is simple: when reading figures that look convincing and precise, you should always stop and question what, if anything, is missing. The need for accountability by government from the higher education sector means collectively we are constantly being measured in ways that may or may not have any precision. </p> <p>For a warped metre rule, it is easy enough to carry out a calibration against a steel ruler much more resistant to distortion and destruction than the wood. For many other situations, no such simple remedy exists.</p>",

This part of Death Valley shares other characteristics with <a href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=78860 \">Martian landscapes</a>, and the area has long been a favorite for scientists planning for Mars landing sites.

Each year, the ice cap goes through a shrink-and-swell cycle, melting throughout the summer months before expanding through fall and winter. In the past decade in particular the minimum summertime extent of the ice cap has shown a consistent decline in size a trend closely linked with the Arctic's warming climate.

Today, few remnants of Lahontan remain; most of its arms have become dry enclosed basins known as playas. This photograph highlights Walker Lake, one of only two remnant lakes that contain water throughout the year (Pyramid Lake in Nevada is the other).

As the northernmost extent of Baffin Bay, it carries water from the Arctic Ocean southward and, at times, it also carries icebergs. Since the calving event in July, in which the floating ice at the tip of Petermann Glacier broke free, the iceberg has drifted slowly southwards. Several fragments of PII-2012 have been identified, and have each floated southward more quickly.

Coming from a man who, two years later, would suffer a notorious run-in with Led Zeppelin in Oakland, California, these were prescient words. For rock music never has surpassed the \"massness\" Zeppelin then enjoyed, a story told in my new oral history of the group, Trampled Under Foot.</p> <p>\"The legions of disenfranchised young American warriors had no outlet whatsoever,\" says the singer Michael Des Barres, whom Zeppelin signed to their Swan Song label. \"Led Zeppelin came along and gave them a hard-on like they'd never had before. Their lives became three chords and a stadium parking lot. There was no TMZ, no internet. There was just this incantation, this wailing to the gods.\"</p> <p>At a time when rock consists of little more than footnotes to the Big Bang that began with Presley and burned out with Cobain, it's hard to explain the scale of Led Zeppelin's 70s success except by framing it in terms of a kind of cult worship. Their final British gigs \u2013 two shows at Knebworth in 1979 \u2013 were watched by an estimated 200,000 people. But it was in the US where the cult of Zeppelin was at its deepest.</p> <p>\"America fell in love with Led Zeppelin because most people hadn't had the opportunity to see the Beatles,\" says Denny Somach, producer of <a href=\"http://tunein.com/radio/Get-the-Led-Out-p193015/\" title=\"\">Get the Led Out</a>, a long-running Zeppelin segment that is syndicated on classic-rock radio across the States. \"Zeppelin became a religion.\"</p> <p>\"They redefined the 60s in the image of all teenagers for whom hippiedom was a cultural given rather than a historical inevitability,\" wrote Robert Christgau of the Village Voice. \"All the kids forced by economic reality and personal limitation \u2026 to settle for representation of power because the real power their older siblings pretended to was so obviously a hallucination.\"</p> <p>The music had something to do with their success, of course. After suffering critical scorn for much of their existence and then being forgotten for most of the 80s, only now are Zeppelin being embraced by pop snobs as the eclectic and mercurial unit they were. Guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboard player John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham were three of rock's most united, thrilling players, and Robert Plant the most frighteningly exciting hard rock singer who ever shrieked into a microphone.</p> <p>The critics didn't know, but the young boys understood. \"Zeppelin had this exotic otherworldly appeal,\" says Brad Tolinski, author of a forthcoming collection of interviews with Page. \"They took us out of our environment.

The sheer depravity of their behaviour in the city \u2013 dangling people over balconies and chaining groupies to radiators \u2013 topped anything British bands had previously perpetrated in America. \"Something about Zeppelin's energy really altered the joie de vivre of the LA rock scene,\" says super-groupie Pamela Des Barres. \"They thought they could get away with anything \u2013 and they could.\"</p> <p>So where do you go from the top of the entertainment mountain? That's right, downhill \u2013 creatively, physically and morally. After 1975's Physical Graffiti, they were never the same creative force. Page sank into heroin addiction, Bonham into the chronic alcoholism that killed him \u2013 and thereby ended the group \u2013 in 1980.</p> <p>The group's last show on US soil followed the incident in Oakland. First a security guard, Jim Matzorkis, was attacked by John Bonham after a perceived slight against Grant's son, then Grant \u2013 aided by John Bindon, a psychopathic actor and semi-gangster recruited to the entourage \u2013 followed up, more brutally. The incident was hushed up, and Zeppelin left the city after charges were brought against four people, including Bonham and Grant.</p> <p>A day later, Robert Plant's five-year-old son Karac died from a respiratory infection, a devastating loss that almost made the singer walk away from music forever.</p> <p>As a narrative, Led Zeppelin's is an old fable: be careful what you wish for, and never fly too close to the sun. Plant survived to tell his tale and to blossom as a solo explorer. Jones always took the mega-success with a pinch of salt anyway. Only Page seems stuck in his past, surviving on a steady diet of awards shows and Classic Rock magazine covers.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-cfc3rCQOuU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-cfc3rCQOuU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cfc3rCQOuU\">Reading this on a mobile?

  "<p>Sustainability is a key focus in development studies. Many academics, NGOs and practitioners are increasingly aware of the impossibility of separating development from changes in the environment. Some university courses offer modules on the relationship between the environment and development, and some institutions offer entire courses on the subject. Studying the environment and development together will help you understand how development, growth and environmental degradation are interrelated. Below is a range of key development topics and suggested reads.</p> <h2>Food and farming</h2> <p>How can the world grow enough food to feed its people? How can high-intensity farming be made more sustainable? What future for pastoralism? Other topics include subsistence farming, genetic modification and the practical and ethical considerations of using agrarian land to produce non-food crops such as biofuels.<br><strong>Suggested read:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780415507141\" title=\"\">Contested Agronomy, by James Sumberg and John Thompson</a>.</p> <h2>Water and waste</h2> <p>Topics include finding ways to use water more sustainably in water-scarce areas (including practical solutions to providing drinking water and sanitation), drought policy, flooding and the threat posed to low-lying communities by rising sea levels.<br><strong>Suggested read:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781903919583\" title=\"\">When the Rivers Run Dry: What Happens When our Water Runs Out?, by Fred Pearce</a>.

  "<p>Despite its revival in the media as the potential source of all evil in the business world, corporate culture remains a concept that is difficult to define. The lack of a clear definition means some people use a vague notion of corporate culture as a scapegoat for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/bp-oil-spill?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">accidents such as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill</a>, or for potential cases of corruption like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/libor?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the Libor scandal</a>.</p> <p>It is important to note that UK corporations may be convicted of manslaughter or even homicide under the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/19/contents\" title=\"\">Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act of 2007</a>. Specifically, section 8(3)(a) states: <em>\"The jury may also consider the extent to which the evidence shows that there were attitudes, policies, systems or accepted practices within the organisation that were likely to have encouraged any such failure as is mentioned in subsection (2), or to have produced tolerance of it.\"</em></p> <p>The wording of this part of the law perhaps also reflects the way many people perceive the modern corporation. We tend to anthropomorphise businesses, treating them in the same way we treat our friends. If our friends \"betray\" us by not acting in the way we expect of them in terms of loyalty and honesty, we lose trust in them and may even cease to be friends. Similarly, if businesses engage in \"bad\" practices that do not follow some code of conduct that we, as a society, deem appropriate and acceptable, we discontinue our transactions with them.</p> <p>A number of surveys suggest that trust in business has been steadily declining in recent years because of major scandals, such as Enron, and the financial crisis itself. Yet in an era in which humans are for the first time having an adverse affect on the Earth's ecosystem, trust in business is a topic within the broader discussion of whether modern corporations will contribute to a resolution of the planet's most urgent and challenging problems.</p> <p>This is also an era in which the very notion of sustainability for corporations is extending beyond the economic domain; instead becoming the foundation of business models that synergistically generate social and environmental value, as well as economic. It does this by harnessing innovations that address the long-term needs and expectations of numerous stakeholders while trading-off short-term pressures.</p> <p>We would be suspicious of a person who behaves ethically and unethically at the same time, but we should understand that the case is different when we talk about corporations; especially for those that have embarked on a journey to become sustainable. To anthropomorphise corporate cultures \u2013 as we do for legal reasons \u2013 would be equivalent to demanding they do \"good\" things all the time. Yet what we need to accept is that companies, unlike individuals, can be \"good\" and \"bad\" at the same time.</p> <p>For example, there have been serious concerns raised about whether some of PepsiCo's products are linked to obesity and diabetes, yet the company has <a href=\"http://www.triplepundit.com/2012/06/pepsico-stockholm-industry-water-award/\" title=\"\">cut its global water consumption by 16 billion litres</a> since 2006: an impressive achievement.</p> <p>So, is corporate culture like our friends? Well, in some ways it is. Friendships are based on trust and cultivated over time, requiring effort and investment. The same is true when deciding whether to trust a given corporate culture as a sustainable one. We need to understand that such cultures take time to emerge; they require the establishment of a strong foundation in the form of organisational governance, stakeholder engagement, longer-term horizons, transparency, accountability and trustworthy communication with constituencies.</p> <p>In the same way that our friends' characters evolve, corporate cultures also evolve and adjust, but they are susceptible to more errors, given the tremendous task of embedding and mobilising a diverse community of individuals. Accordingly, I would argue, they are entitled to be given a larger benefit of the doubt; particularly when they make significant effort to rectify past errors. <a href=\"www.globescan.com/commentary-and-analysis/featured-findings/228-positive-ratings-of-bp-as-environmentally-responsible-suggest-its-rehabilitation-is-underway.html\">Public opinion data</a> from GlobalScan suggests BP is gaining back some of its environmental reputation as a result of its response to the Deepwater Horizon spill.</p> <p>Of course, not all businesses are capable of establishing sustainable corporate cultures that allow us to trust them fully to be \"good\" all or even most of the time. But then again, we do get to choose who to trust as our friends, don't we? Even if they sometimes make mistakes.</p> <p><em>Ioannis Ioannou is assistant professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at London Business School</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

But not the skanky plastic garbage peddled by Maccy D's, KFC and their ilk. Instead, I might have a crisp, lightly browned dosa (rice and lentil crepe) with coconut chutney for breakfast, pav bhaji (bread rolls with a buttery vegetable hash) for lunch and chaat (a spicy mix of potatoes, yoghurt, onions, tomatoes, cilantro and crispy bits) for a snack. Usually, these will cost me about Rs 50 (about 50p), less than a McDonald's veggie burger, which goes for Rs 59. They will be healthier, tastier, fresher.</p> <p>The recent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10423158\" title=\"\">announcement by McDonald's that it is launching a veggie restaurant in India</a> had me bellowing \"What fresh hell is this?\" It's the culinary equivalent of selling ice to Inuits. Inuits may not have more than a hundred words for snow \u2013 apparently it's an urban myth \u2013 but I can assure you that Indians have many more than a hundred varieties of veggie fast food, not just a plain one-size-fits-all potato patty.</p> <p>Oh, I have tried McDonald's veggie offerings, the ones carefully created for my primitive brown taste buds after years of research. Once. The dull <a href=\"http://cdn.gunaxin.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mcaloo-tikki.jpg\" title=\"\">McAloo Tikki burger</a> is not a patch on the infinitely more delicious crispy alu tikkis with tamarind chutney found at any street vendor. Their <a href=\"http://thechatterjis.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/paneer-burger2.png\" title=\"\">McSpicy Paneer</a> is a cop-out, falling back on that bland veggie standby: paneer. It's the insipid nut roast of India, the tofu of timidity.</p> <p>Cleanliness, you say? Nope. Even if you are a foreigner with a stomach like tissue paper, you are better off eating piping hot, fresh dosas from a busy street vendor than you are eating stale fast food. India has always had homegrown chains of veggie fast food joints which are every bit as clean and quality conscious as McDonald's, perhaps even more so. And I'd rather give my money to a small business owner than a McCorporation.</p> <p>But hey, I am not going to sermonise. Or even tell you, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Size_Me\" title=\"\">Morgan Spurlock</a>-style, that veggie burgers are killing you slowly. I don't need to. After almost 16 years in India, McDonald's has just over 250 outlets here, which, in such a massive country, is pocket change. I suspect that Indians are smart enough to know which side of their pav bhaji is buttered. Sure, broke students and tubby kids hankering after plastic toys will continue to eat there, but there will also be plenty like me who shun the Golden Arches in favour of a truly happy and tasty meal.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Kavitha Rao is a Bangalore-based journalist</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrew-tobert\" title=\"\"><strong>Andrew Tobert</strong></a><strong>: I'm lovin' it</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395739861\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346927091929/tobert.jpg\" alt=\"tobert\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are few more powerful symbols than the Golden Arches. For me, they represent at once the homogenising influence of market forces, the evil of industrialised agriculture, the obesity crisis. And the last time I was truly happy.</p> <p>McDonald's, from the first time I crossed its air-conditioned threshold, has offered a place of sanctuary and calm. The smell of whatever-that-smell-is wafting through the air and the happy children, joyous with additives swirling around their blood streams. This is where I've had my best thoughts, my most cherished memories. This is where I can truly be me.</p> <p>And I'm not alone. From Shanghai to Chicago, kids, pensioners, lawyers and students come and are welcome. However much people might not want this to be true, McDonald's is the global restaurant \u2013 the place that unites humanity. You might find better, cheaper food elsewhere, but that's not going to convince Parisian school kids or London lawyers coming back for more.</p> <p>I used to go three times a week (and yes, dear readers, I was a fat child). I wasn't just lovin' it, I was stalking it on Facebook, and naming our soon-to-be-children. But three months ago, my life changed for ever. I became vegetarian (something about climate change and global hunger, but I forget the details). My place of solace was now closed off.</p> <p>Of course when I walk by a restaurant, it looks as it always has. As I stand on the street corner, I see people laughing, enjoying themselves. I want to go in, and share the things that make us human. But I know I can't, the temptations will be too much. The Chicken Selects, the Big Mac, the fries (I could go on), so delicious and so stunningly cheap. I miss them. A lot. But I made my choice, and I must accept the consequences. So there's me, outside. An outcast in a meat-eating world. But perhaps not for much longer.</p> <p>That's why a McDonald's veggie restaurant in India fills me with unadulterated joy and hope. Yes, there are <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=haterz\" title=\"\">haterz</a>, there always are. And to them I say, whatevs. Indians won't all become obese overnight, and their cuisine isn't going to suddenly disappear. Maybe Indian vegetarians, like their meat-eating peers the world over, watch McDonald's ads and think \"you know what, that looks cool\". And isn't that a wonderful thing? That we live in a world where people can pick and choose the best of global culture, regardless of where they were born? McDonald's is the global emancipator. May its benevolence spread far and wide.</p> <p>But first, could the veggie outlets spread to London? Say, Hackney, E9. Then I won't feel a stab of jealousy every time I pass a branch. And maybe then I can stop resenting being a vegetarian, and start actually enjoying it. Yes, those really will be the (Mc)Salad days.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Andrew Tobert is a copywriter, an environmental activist and a lousy vegetarian</em></p>",

  "<p>The Ironmongers' Hall in Barbican provided a lavish venue for the Lions this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/04/warren-gatland-lions-head-coach\" title=\"\">as they introduced Warren Gatland as the head coach</a> for next year's tour to Australia. It was chosen because it was adjacent to the site of the old Manchester Hotel, flattened during the Blitz, where the forerunners of the Lions gathered for their farewell dinner before heading offto the same location in 1888.</p> <p>There was a time in the early years of the professional era when the Lions made a loss for the four home unions, but they are now unashamedly commercial, one reason why next year's tour kicks off with a fixture against the Barbarians in Hong Kong, an important base of the principal sponsors, HSBC.</p> <p>There may well be a similar excursion before the 2017 trip to New Zealand: Fiji have already issued an invitation, but it would not be a missionary visit as in the old days: it would have to be profitable. The Lions are big business, making money for the unions who host them to such an extent that without the tourists, Sanzar countries would struggle to hold on to their best players, never mind that they each enjoy visits just once every 12 years.</p> <p>The Lions expect that 40,000 supporters will be following them in Australia, as many as were in South Africa in 2009, a figure that would be remarkable at any time, never mind during the worst economic climate since the 1930s. The Lions are attracting global companies as backers and a tour by them has become the game's second biggest event after a World Cup.</p> <p>It almost seemed sacriligeous to ask, given the setting and the mood of celebration, but given the failure of the Lions to win a series since 1997 and with just three victories in their last 10 Tests, would an ever-inflating bubble be burst if success on the field remained elusive? Would tens of thousands spend thousands of pounds flying thousands of miles to watch a team likely to lose a Test rubber not because the players and coaches were not up to it, but because the domestic calendar in the British Isles made no concessions to the Lions?</p> <p>Warren Gatland's squad will gather six days before the match in Hong Kong, a day after the finals of the Aviva Premiership and RaboDirect Pro 12 are played, and little more than a week after the two European finals. The amateur era, when tours were considerably longer and player release was not an issue, showed how testing it was to mould a squad of players from four different countries. Gatland and his management team will have little more than a month to find the mix before the first Test.</p> <p>The Lions have two more tours under the current agreement with the Sanzar unions. Their current manager, Andy Irvine, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/sep/04/andy-irvine-british-and-irish-lions\" title=\"\">said a new deal must provide adequate preparation time</a>, even if it meant moving the start of a trip back by two weeks. He accepted that clubs, as well as unions and the International Rugby Board, would need to be involved in any discussion: putting back to start date would delay the time players would return to their clubs/provinces/regions, impacting on the Premiership and the Pro 12, and the season in the southern hemisphere is longer now with the Super 15 and the Rugby Championship both enhanced.</p> <p>There is little wriggle room. In 2009, the Premiership play-off final was brought forward but a Lions tour brings little tangible reward for clubs, apart from the compensation they receive for supplying players. They are part of the effort, but the Lions are very much a product of the four unions involved.</p> <p>If there is to be any meaningful and profound change after 2017, it will only be because the clubs are part of the decision-making process. That would mean they had a share in the rewards: it is not enough for the Lions to point to intangible rewards, such as the heightened interest in rugby union there will be next summer with no major football tournament being held.</p> <p>Two of the last three tours have been lost by narrow margins. The Lions won the first Test in Australia in 2001, reward perhaps for the then coach Graham Henry deciding his Test team in advance and focusing on that formation in training from the start, a policy since viewed as contrary to what the Lions stand for.</p> <p>The second Test turned when Richard Hill was taken out off the ball by Nathan Grey, ending his tour. The Wallaby centre was not cited, a decision almost as shocking as that four years later to ignore the spear-tackle that ended Brian O'Driscoll's tour in New Zealand.</p> <p>In 2009, the Lions looked more resourceful than South Africa, but a series of less than demanding warm-up games left them vulnerable and they were targeted in the scrum in the first Test. They threw away the second after being decimated by injuries and comfortably won the third.</p> <p>The tour to New Zealand in 2005 was a failure in every sense bar one. Henry was by then in charge of the All Blacks and the Lions arrived with an army that left the many who were confined to minor skirmishing disaffected. Gatland intends to take no more than 35 players to Australia, giving everyone a chance in the opening weeks to challenge for a place in the Test side.</p> <p>It will be only the second tour in the professional era that Sir Ian McGeechan has not been involved in \u2013 2001 was the other. He helped provide the sole salvation in 2005, ensuring that the midweek team did not fall apart and his understanding of the Lions' ethos is unrivalled. Without him, the tours may have stopped after 1997.</p> <p>McGeechan will not be used as an adviser next year, even though he has a tie-up with one of the sponsors. The Lions committee feels that it would be unfair to cast his shadow over Gatland, but given the lack of preparation time and the fact that some leading players for their countries are not going to be in the Test side \u2013 the back row, for example, will be fiercely competitive \u2013 it would be daft not to have him available as a sounding board, a man with a burning pride in the Lions.</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/thebreakdown\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby.

Functional layouts</strong> </p> <p>To Western audiences, accustomed to more art-directed and visually rich, interactive websites, these sites can appear to be quite spartan and text-driven.</p> <p>However, this predominance of text over richer content is already present <a href=\"http://en.kiosko.net/jp/np/asahi_shimbun.html\">in their print versions</a>, and there are other sectors which thrive in more <a href=\"http://www.sal.ne.jp/\">creative</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hokusai.gr.jp/\">artistic</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ffffff.jp/\">subtle</a> designs \u2013 overall the Japanese feel perfectly comfortable with mostly text news information. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988344\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347297861494/print-asahi.png\" alt=\"Asahi newspaper screenshot\" width=\"460\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Front page of the Asahi newspaper.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>Japanese news sites predominantly carry only headlines, date of publication and an icon that marks the type of content. This allows for quick page loads and encourages quick jumping from page to page. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988345\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347297540583/trails.png\" alt=\"japanese news sites headlines\" width=\"460\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headlines with date or time and an icon to mark the content (red means special feature). From asahi.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>In contrast to this, the Guardian has 10 different types of content and the large size of the homepage accounts for a fair amount of all page impressions.</p> <p><strong>2. From WAP to app</strong></p> <p>Japan was a world leader in the development of the mobile platform under WAP, and these sites are clearly optimised for fast rendering in smaller screens for quickly jumping between links. All three papers have mobile optimised versions, and they also offer apps for mobile, tablet and Facebook, along with Kindle versions and special packages (included as bundles with some mobile operators), as well as having premium services. </p> <p>If we pick one example per site:<br>- <a href=\"http://premium.yomiuri.co.jp/html/pc/index.html\">Yomiuri premium</a>: a paying service with exclusive features like mobile alerts, scrapbook to read later, storing by news by keyword, exclusive offers to subscribers.</p> <p>- <a href=\"http://www.mainichi.co.jp/tap-i/about/\">Mainichi tap-i</a>: an app with selected content laid out in a visually rich magazine-style layout for tablets and apps, on both iOS and Android platforms.</p> <p>- <a href=\"http://digital.asahi.com/info/functions/index.html\">Asahi</a> this page details all of the different combinations of content and platform to choose from \u2013 they're all paid-for, customised options. </p> <p>As for the Guardian, it currently offers a mobile version, and a suite of apps from an iPad version to crossword apps across mobile platforms, as well as some apps for smart TVs.</p> <p><strong>3. Regional focus</strong><br>Perhaps the feature I find most interesting is their emphasis on breakdown of news by region (<a href=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/e-japan/\">Yomiuri</a>, <a href=\"http://mytown.asahi.com/\">Asahi</a>, <a href=\"http://mainichi.jp/area/\">Mainichi</a>). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988346\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009623304/Aviary_mainichi-jp_region.png\" alt=\"Mainichi region chooser map\" width=\"460\" height=\"379\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mainichi regional map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just as the print newspapers have customised content and sections for each of Japan's 47 prefectures, their websites feature a 'region tab' very prominently in the top menu which directs users to a map 'chooser' for the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988347\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009653012/Aviary_mytown-asahi-com_region.png\" alt=\"Asahi region chooser map\" width=\"460\" height=\"227\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asahi regional map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This seems like a good solution to manage local within a national scope and reflects the population's trust in the media to keep them informed of the events in their everyday life. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/7/1347009678344/Aviary_yomiuri-co-jp_regions.png\" alt=\"Yomiuri region chooser map\" width=\"460\" height=\"524\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yomiuri regional map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moreover, they all offer a more concise, less cluttered version of their news in English for an international audience (<a href=\"http://ajw.asahi.com/\">Asahi</a>, <a href=\"http://mainichi.jp/english/\">Mainichi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/\">Yomiuri</a>). </p> <p>Recently, the Guardian experimented with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local\">hyperlocal sections</a> and has some keywords for cities and counties.</p> <p><strong>4. Advertorials</strong></p> <p>A quite unique characteristic of Japanese websites is the greater mixture of sponsored and editorial content. </p> <p>Sprinkled throughout the page and not confined to the now-increasingly invisible right hand column or the bottom of the page, they appear in the middle of the content, in between headlines and sometimes without special typography or colours to make them stand out from the editorial content, although many are marked with \"<em>PR</em>\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395988349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/10/1347299156136/yomiuri-ads.png\" alt=\"yomiuri site ad regions\" width=\"460\" height=\"1670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biggest ad blocks on the home page of yomiuri.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ivan Codesido/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>&#xa0;</p> <p>This is in line with Japanese society where it's not rare to see, for instance, consecrated actors or singers advertising products as a launchpad for their latest artistic endeavours. </p> <p>The Guardian has a promo column for commercial content and Google's AdSense, as well as microsites for sponsored content and badges for sponsored sections or series.</p> <p><strong>5. The science bit</strong></p> <p>Although relatively up-to-date, these sites err on the side of caution: <br></p> <ul> <li>No HTML5 tags or features seem to be present</li> <li>URLs are alphanumeric and therefore SEO-poor</li> <li>jQuery is used for interactivity, although an older version (1.4) </li> <li>There are hardly any \"interactives\" to speak of. </li> <li>Social sharing and user registration exist, but they don't seem to be given special prominence </li> <li>Scripts and stylesheets don't seem to be merged together and they are placed at the top of the page </li> <li>The column layout is liquid, but not responsive at breakpoints. </li> </ul> <p>The Mainich, which is the only one of the three that has been rebuilt and redesigned recently, is the more up-to-date, with HTML5 tags, jQuery 1.7, although no asynchronous or delayed loading of scripts, no spriting of icons, nor much dynamic AJAX functionality present in any of them. </p> <p>In terms of page weight, although all three average one megabyte, interestingly Mainichi is the loser here, serving only around one tenth of its content from the browser cache.</p> <h2>In conclusion</h2> <p>Although many of the most recent innovations don't seem to be present in the top three general news online Japanese media, maybe the fast load and the speed of Japanese networks means that those are not priorities for them. </p> <p>As for multiplatform, they take a wide approach with the creation of native or web apps and special deals with other media and technology industries.</p> <p>This reflects the current trend where news businesses are leaving the rigid framework of the website and their curators to be ubiquitous in a plethora of digital environments: social, tablet, TV, mobile, outdoor displays and who could tell where next.</p> <p><sub><em>Background image: Mituskoshi, 2004 \u24b8 <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=akira+yamaguchi\">Akira Yamaguchi</a>.</em></sub></p>",
  "<p>Investors in <strong>Morrisons</strong> have been increasingly concerned about the supermarket group lagging behind its rivals, but the Bradford-based grocer has given them some cheer with better than expected first half results.</p> <p>The UK's fourth biggest supermarket group said profits in the latest six months rose 1% to \u00a3445m, compared to analyst expectations of around \u00a3434m. Like for like sales, excluding VAT and petrol, fell 0.9%, an improvement on the 1% fall recorded in the first quarter.</p> <p>But it has decided to reduce its capital expenditure programme by \u00a3200m over the next two years, slowing its store opening programme to \"focus resources tightly.\"</p> <p>Recent industry data from Kantar Worldpanel showed slower sales growth for Morrisons than its three main rivals, Tesco, Sainsbury and Asda, as well as the discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco in particular has been making strong efforts to regain ground in the UK market after a profit warning in January, putting pressure on the rest of the sector.</p> <p>Morrisons said it expected the challenging economic environment and consumer pressures to continue in the second half, and into 2013:</p> <blockquote> Notwithstanding these conditions, the board believes the group will meet its expectations for the year. <br> </blockquote> <p>There has been much speculation about how Morrisons intends to tackle the growing online grocery market, which has even led to talk in the past that it might pounce on Ocado. But the company told Reuters it was still undecided about launching a full online food service.</p> <p>The better than expected figures have helped push Morrisons' shares 9.5p higher to 290.2p. But many analysts are not convinced. Darren Shirley at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> We are pleased that Morrison will cut its capex plans by \u00a3200m over the this year and next, reducing its new space opening programme by 0.5m square feet over the period, though we question whether this reflects more the difficulty in achieving targets rather than prudence by management. Looking forward, management paints a challenging outlook for the second, and states it will meet expectations for the year, though we note 'consensus' expectations have continued to fall in recent months. We reiterate our sell recommendation. </blockquote> <p>Philip Dorgan at Panmure Gordon is also a seller:</p> <blockquote> FTSE100 food retail valuations have become compressed because investors believe that they are all playing the same game and destroying value. We think that this will change because management will stop playing the space game. While we are encouraged, by the statement's reference to lower capital expenditure, we continue to believe that Morrison's numbers have the most risk. We therefore maintain our target price of 240p and our sell recommendation. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall, the market is in recovery mode ahead of the keenly awaited European Central Bank meeting this afternoon, when more details of its bond buying plans are expected. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is up 42.01 points at 5699.88 after two days of decline.</p>",
  "<p>The liberalisation of markets, coupled with greater levels of international trade co-operation, means that the world is now almost borderless.</p> <p>This provides huge opportunities for businesses to grow by expanding into new markets. The sort of access once considered impossible is now a very real possibility. And the benefits for those businesses that take advantage of these opportunities can potentially be sizeable \u2013 an increased global presence, larger market share and higher profits.</p> <p>In the UK, during tough economic conditions, growing market share and exporting into new markets could be a real driver of economic recovery.</p> <p>That is not to say that there are no challenges. While trade barriers may have lessened, technical barriers remain. \"Technical trade barriers\" are those that governments erect in the form of product testing and certification requirements. Manufacturers have to overcome these barriers in order to access new countries and markets and get their products on to shelves.</p> <p>The regulatory framework is becoming increasingly complex. Countries are drafting and enforcing more regulations \u2013 and are constantly updating and developing these regulations to include a better scope for things such as social compliance, business continuity and the environment, in addition to electrical compatibility and safety.</p> <p>The process of obtaining separate approvals for each market can be complicated, time-consuming and costly. It is important for business to ensure that the process is handled competently and efficiently, otherwise it could add cost and delay a product's entry to market \u2013 causing a company to lose its competitive edge, even if it has a superior product.</p> <p>This should give businesses pause for thought \u2013 but it does not mean they should be discouraged from taking their products to new markets. With proper planning and the correct partner, there is no reason not to proceed \u2013 and, with luck, reap the benefits. These tips should help:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Think about compliance at a very early stage. </strong>Even while your business is designing new products, it is worth considering at that stage what compliance issues you are likely to face when you come to take the products into new markets. An early understanding of the electrical safety, electromagnetic compatibility, telecoms and radio frequency requirements of different countries can avoid non-compliances and costly re-designs further down the line</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Investigate international compliance management</strong>. ICM is a systematic process for managing compliance with regulators for companies looking for access to global markets. ICM typically involves partnering an expert in international compliance who can act as a single interface when dealing with regulators in different countries. ICM can significantly reduce the time it takes to bring a product to market.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Undertake research</strong> to understand exactly which compliance certifications will be accepted in each of your target markets. For example, depending on the market and the product, some products will need to be tested in the target country by accredited certification bodies. Others countries will accept recognised certification issued from outside the country. Be aware of this at the beginning of the process and plan accordingly.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Customs clearance</strong>. Even with correct accreditations, in some countries it can be challenging to get products through customs and into the market. You want to avoid the unnecessary delays that this can lead to. Ensure that you use a shipping agent that has experience in the markets you are shipping to and is aware of customs procedures in that market.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Shipping inspections</strong>. Conduct pre and post shipping inspections to smooth the process and ensure that your clients or partners receive exactly what they are expecting. This can further reduce the time it takes to get your product to market.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Give yourself time</strong>! For some markets, accreditation can take up to six months. This doesn't mean anything is going wrong, but it is still important to ensure that you factor this in to your planning so that you are not caught out.</p> <p>With proper planning, the right partner and a thorough attitude to compliance, there is no reason why businesses from the UK cannot take advantage of the opportunities thrown up by entering new markets.</p> <p><em>Jean-Louis Evans is the managing director of </em><a href=\"http://www.tuvps.co.uk/home_psuk\" title=\"\"><em>TUV SUD Product Service</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>Another day, another chance to save the world. It is not without reason that Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, is dubbed Super Mario.</p> <p>After just 10 months in the job, the 64-year-old Italian has by turns impressed, disappointed and perplexed the markets. His first decisive moves to cut rates to a record low of 1% and flood European banks with cheap money were widely hailed as having pulled the euro back from the brink. But his bombastic talk has often been misunderstood, sending markets haywire when the ECB fails to follow through with definite action.</p> <p>He has a breadth of experience few central bankers can boast, spanning academia, government, the private sector and regulatory bodies. Educated at the prestigious US university MIT, he has taught at Harvard and is one of Europe's best economic minds. A stint at the World Bank in the 80s was followed by a job as director general of the Italian treasury. He then moved into the private sector, joining Goldman Sachs for five years, before taking on the thankless task of being governor of the Bank of Italy, where he was credited with helping steer Italy's debt-ridden economy through the crisis without requiring financial assistance. Most recently, he impressed as head of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a global bank regulator that drafted the Basel III agreement \u2013 the new regulatory framework for banks and other financial institutions.</p> <p>His time in the US, in particular, is said to have influenced him, driving him to act early rather than take the German wait-and-see attitude that has often prevailed in Europe. He is said to be a good delegator, giving other members of the ECB governing board weighty roles and then letting them get on with it. Where his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, was known for being rigid and domineering, Draghi is applauded for encouraging discussion. Notably, ECB colleagues refer to Draghi as Mario, whereas Trichet was always Trichet.</p> <p>Draghi is careful to keep his private life private and is rarely seen in public with his wife. A few key facts are known about his past. He was orphaned in his mid-teens, when his biochemist mother and bank-executive father both died. Draghi was brought up by an aunt and later taken under the wing of Federico Caffe, a prominent Italian economist and university professor. A keen golfer, Draghi is said to maintain a work-life balance despite being in one of the most high-pressure jobs in the global economy.</p> <p>Some say his performance on Thursday will decide whether he can keep that job. He has promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro. But does he have what it takes?</p>",
  "<p>The House of Commons will today <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmfbusi/a01.htm\" title=\"\">debate the motion</a> that the government should take \"all necessary steps\" to stabilise the UK's population \"as close as possible to its present level\". What the motion's authors really want, of course, is for the government to cut net immigration to zero. But in choosing to frame the debate around population growth, they have created a useful opportunity. The old line that \"we aren't allowed to talk about immigration\" is clearly no longer true, if it ever was, but population issues are genuinely neglected, in public debate and inside the policymaking community.</p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/index.html\" title=\"\">2011 Census</a> showed, there are three main drivers of our growing population: increasing longevity, increasing fertility, and positive net immigration. The second of these, fertility, is partly related to the third: migrants are more likely to be of child-bearing age, and foreign-born mothers have more children than those UK-born. But contrary to some of the fears of anti-immigration campaigners, the fertility gap is not widening but closing: the most recent figures show foreign-born mothers having fewer babies than they were, while the fertility rate of UK-born mothers continues to rise.</p> <p>Even those who are worried by population growth would accept that slowing down improvements in healthcare (to reduce longevity) or in childcare (to reduce fertility) would be cutting off our nose to spite our face. All the more important, many will say, to focus on the third driver, immigration. But here too, the changes that would be necessary to cut net immigration to the level the motion calls for \u2013 and logically that means cutting it to less than zero, if fertility and longevity are to continue increasing \u2013 would have costs which many would regard as unacceptable if they thought about them seriously. Cutting net immigration to this extent would mean going far beyond immigration policy as it is generally understood: it would mean leaving the European Union, and telling British citizens they can no longer marry who they like, as well as closing our universities to foreign students. It might even require us, perversely, to dampen economic growth (despite our current troubles, increasing numbers are coming here from Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy), and pull back from Britain's traditional global role in culture and trade.</p> <p>A more productive debate would focus not on overall numbers, but on how we best respond to a growing population, whatever its causes. The ageing society is notorious for being an issue that politicians of all parties have been slow to grasp. Rising fertility ought to be easier to deal with, but both the previous government and the coalition have fallen short, both in maternity services and primary school places. We also need to ensure that the funding mechanisms, which match public money with local population changes, respond far more quickly than they did over the last decade. And of course we need to deal with the growing shortage of housing.</p> <p>These are very serious challenges; it is understandable if people think that until we come up with some solutions, we should not be making them worse. But it would be a shame if we slipped into the mindset of seeing a growing population as essentially a drain on resources. Even in the case of longevity this is a mean-spirited and indeed narrow-minded way of thinking about the issue. In the case of fertility and immigration, it is simply incorrect to see extra people purely as a burden, and not as current or future workers who will pay the taxes to fund public services and help reduce the deficit and public debt.</p> <p>Some will argue that even if a growing population is a good thing in the abstract \u2013 or in big countries like America or Australia or Canada \u2013 Britain (or at least England) is a small country that is simply \"full up\". It is true that we are relatively densely populated; but it is also true that even if the UK population did reach 70 million, if it lived as densely as Londoners, it would occupy an area of just under 6,000km<sup>2</sup> : less than 5% of England. At any conceivable level off population, it is how this population is distributed which matters far more than the overall number. Even in housing, where the challenge seems the most intractable, building enough to accommodate 70 million, far from concreting over the whole of England, would increase the developed area from 10% to 12%.</p> <p>The same kind of answer applies to those who worry about population growth at a global level. Are we not adding irresponsibly to problems of climate change, or resource scarcity, which already look insurmountable? The answer, again, is that these problems are driven not just by overall numbers but by changes in the distribution of population \u2013 in particular, by increasing urbanisation \u2013 and by changes in patterns of consumption; and that the kind of breakthroughs we need to make, in achieving more efficient, responsible, and fair use of resources, would \u2013 if we succeed in making them \u2013 easily swallow up current levels of population growth across the developed world.</p>",

  "<p>The European commission upped the ante in a potential trade war with China on Thursday, announcing an investigation into allegedly unfair exports of solar panels worth more than \u20ac20bn (\u00a315.85bn) a year.</p> <p>Leading European solar panel manufacturers complained in July that China was demolishing competition by exporting the panels at a loss.</p> <p>\"In terms of import value affected, this is the most significant anti-dumping complaint the European commission has received so far,\" the commission said.</p> <p>Last year China, which accounts for two thirds of global production, exported solar panels worth \u20ac21bn to the EU, some 80% of exported panels. The market is huge. In the span of a few years, China has become the world's biggest solar panels producer, while the EU is by far the biggest market for the Chinese products.</p> <p>The probe threatens to be extremely contentious and highly sensitive politically. The German government, enjoying a trade and exports-based \"special relationship\" with China, is wary of incurring Beijing's wrath, although the complaint has been spearheaded by German firms.</p> <p>On a recent visit to Beijing, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sought to defuse the escalating dispute, arguing that dialogue and not an EC investigation was the best way to deal with the issue.</p> <p>Beijing's official English-language newspaper, China Daily, warned on Wednesday that Beijing would retaliate with trade curbs on the EU if Brussels went ahead with the investigation. Beijing has also been lobbying hard in Brussels behind the scenes against the probe.</p> <p>\"EU Pro Sun, an industry association, claimed in its complaint lodged on 25 July 2012 that solar panels and their key components imported from China enter the European market at prices below market value,\" the commission said. \"The commission is legally obliged to open an anti-dumping investigation if it receives a valid complaint from a Union industry which provides evidence that exporting producers from one or more countries are dumping a particular product into the EU and causing injury to the Union industry.\"</p> <p>The US authorities have already slapped tariffs on Chinese solar panel exports.</p> <p>The complaint lodged with Brussels came from a consortium of some 20 European producers responsible for a quarter of EU manufacture of panels.</p> <p>The commission said it would deliver a provisional verdict on the dispute by June next year and could then impose temporary tariffs on the Chinese. EU governments would then need to decide how to proceed by the end of next year.</p> <p>China's commerce ministry website responded promptly to the commission move, stating:</p> <p>\"Restricting China's solar panel products will not only hurt the interests of both Chinese and European industry, it will also wreck the healthy development of the global solar and clean energy sector.\" The statement voiced \"deep regret\" at Brussels' action and said the EU should \"seriously consider China's position and proposals, and resolve friction over solar panel trade through consultations and cooperation.\"</p>",
  "<p>The debate over the Department of Energy and Climate Change's press release about local authority carbon emissions before the August bank holiday weekend somewhat obscured the underlying significance of the data, which was presented in a pretty raw form.</p> <p>While the information released covers all of the activity within areas, it doesn't show local authorities how they are performing against their carbon-reduction commitment obligations. This information would be based on a much narrower dataset and focused on the council as an organisation.</p> <p>There is a subset within the department's release designed to cover activity within the \"scope of influence\" of local authorities, but this relates to an old performance metric which no longer applies to councils. These figures use 2005 as a base year by which carbon emissions are measured \u2013 not 1990, which is the base year for calculating all UK greenhouse gas emissions. It's also worth noting that the department moved very quickly to explain away the 2.7% year-on-year increase in per capita emissions since 2009-10 as attributable to \"unusual weather conditions\".</p> <p>You may be left wondering whether there is any analytical value in these spreadsheets? There is a great deal of use in this information, but not in year-on-year comparisons using individual local authorities as the unit of measurement. This data needs to be recast before it can tell us a meaningful story about councils' progress.</p> <p>First, this information gives us a clear view of the national five-year trajectory from 2005. The good news is that the national grand total of carbon dioxide emissions has declined by 10% since 2005; the bad news is that the decline between 2005 and 2009 was 14% \u2013 so more than a quarter of that gain was subsequently lost in 2010. This shows how fragile the trajectory on carbon saving is and reinforces the point that the UK remains a heavily fossil-fuel-driven economy. The transition to a low carbon economy still looks a long way off.</p> <p>Second, by making the right connections between datasets, the information starts to provide an insight into the economic and social activity across the UK. Specifically, we need to recognise the mobility in our economic model and the spheres of influence over emissions levels, particularly for cities and large towns. These trends are influenced by regional economic patterns of industry and commerce. These differences are obscured if we just focus on per capita figures across the board.</p> <p>For example, the City of London's per capita emissions are approximately 20 times greater than most other local authorities because so few people actually live there. The city is, in effect, subsidising the carbon emissions of the dormitory towns that house its workforce.</p> <p>When the figures start to be grouped into city-region clusters, a clearer carbon landscape starts to emerge. We can see how large city regions fare against smaller ones, and how the city core performs against the outer ring. We can consider aggregated carbon dioxide emissions for resources that must be planned across authorities, such as public transport.</p> <p>Intuitively, you would expect the city core to produce lower per capita emissions than the outer ring; our analysis suggests that this is often \u2013 but not always \u2013 the case. Used intelligently, this information should drive policy across all regional investment areas. The question is this: is this what the policymakers want?</p> <p><em>Nathan Goode is head of energy, environment and sustainability at </em><a href=\"http://www.grant-thornton.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Grant Thornton</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and the </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>latest vacancies</strong></a><strong> in your area</strong></p>",
  "<p>As a new political season resumes at Westminster, a succession of disastrous growth figures, an unwillingness to amend the deficit reduction programme despite a faltering economy, and a series of botched decisions on Heathrow and student visas add to the sense of a government that is losing its grip on events. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-david-cameron-conservatives\" title=\"\">Tuesday's reshuffle</a> looks more like a desperate attempt to shore up the prime minister's authority with the right of his party than establishing a serious strategy for government. At long last, Labour is able to shape the political agenda, shifting the terms of the economic policy debate from reducing public debt, to reinvigorating UK growth. The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has been widely praised for leading the attack on George Osborne's ill-timed austerity programme.</p> <p>Yet Labour should remember that it is during periods of greatest political momentum when the hard thinking and strategic heavy lifting of opposition must be done. Rising disillusionment with the coalition, augmented by Labour's markedly improved poll ratings, mean that pressure will grow on the party to stake out a plausible and credible economic alternative, and for the \"two Eds\" \u2013 Miliband and Balls \u2013 the clock is ticking.</p> <p>One obstacle standing in the way of progress is disagreement among senior figures about the nature of New Labour's economic legacy. On one side, those loyal to Blair and Brown insist the party's track record on the economy was one of historic success, certainly between 1997 and the onset of the global crisis in 2007-8. On the other hand, Labour's leader, Ed Miliband, has presented a challenging critique of the neoliberal economic model over which New Labour presided, urging \"a fairer and more responsible capitalism\". In truth, this amounts to a difference of emphasis rather than a philosophical chasm, but it hinders Labour's efforts to develop a more compelling economic story.</p> <p>The truth about Labour's record in government is inevitably more complex than what passes for political debate at Westminster. For much of the party's 13 years in power, rising growth, low inflation, and record levels of employment were matched by sharp improvements in productivity: an <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/events/event.asp?id=145\" title=\"\">average annual rise of 2.8% between 1997 and the start of the 2008 recession</a>, according to Dan Corry and John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics. The claim that New Labour entered into a \"Faustian pact\" with the financial markets, engineering a period of growth built on rising public and private sector debt, ought to be seriously addressed, but ignores substantial progress beyond the growth of financial services.</p> <p>Indeed, sustained investment in skills, science, research and development, and public infrastructure encouraged strong performance in high-value manufacturing sectors far removed from financial markets in the UK, including pharmaceuticals and aerospace. The regional growth divide was narrowing sharply by the mid-2000s. And as the banking crisis unfolded in 2007-8, the Labour government's interventions were purposeful and decisive, leading the Nobel prize-winning economist, Paul Krugman, to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/opinion/13krugman.html\" title=\"\">offer high praise for Gordon Brown's leadership</a>. So airbrushing away 13 years of relatively successful economic management seems unwarranted.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Labour ought to be candid about where it went wrong in seeking to win back voters' trust. The \"light-touch\" regulatory regime practised in the UK banking sector was blind to concerns about the resilience of British banks in the advent of global shocks. Indeed, New Labour embraced a view about the stability of markets which led George Bush's economic adviser, Robert Lucas, to remark in 2005 that, \"for all practical purposes \u2026 the central problem of depression prevention has been solved\". This now appears utterly misconceived. Labour's sanguine view about the near certainty of sustained growth in the world economy meant it relied on too optimistic assumptions about tax receipts, running a modest deficit in the mid-2000s when a surplus would have been more prudent. The fragility of the UK tax base, and the refusal to strengthen tax revenues through additional levies on wealth, capital, and property, was a primary cause of the current crisis in Britain's public finances.</p> <p>Of course in one sense, few voters in 2015 will care much about what happened in an era of politics that now feels like the distant past. But to frame a credible economic strategy, Labour has to learn deeper lessons about its period in power. Clarity about its legacy will enable the party to move on in addressing the economic challenges of the future.</p> <p>It is all too apparent that George Osborne's \"plan A\" amounts to little more than a rehashed 1980s neoliberal agenda of deregulation and labour market \"flexibility\", epitomised by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/may/21/adrain-beecroft-report-consumer-confidence\" title=\"\">Beecroft report</a>'s assault on the rights of employees, and Britain's historic equality legislation. The quest for a permanently smaller state is both ill-conceived and irrelevant to Britain's economic predicament.</p> <p>Labour must confront a fundamental question about the nature of British capitalism \u2013 not just how to kickstart growth in the economy, but how to shift the distribution of the gains from growth to middle and low-waged workers. There are measures that might be adopted to raise the minimum wage, encouraging a \"living wage\" across the public and private sectors. Nonetheless, low wages are primarily structural, sustained by casualised, \"flexible\" and low-skilled sectors of the labour market. Labour's industrial policy and \"new growth model\" to be debated at a Policy Network conference today need to focus not only on fashionable \"high-tech\" manufacturing and \"low-carbon\" industries, but sectors such as retail, hospitality, and social care, as the Resolution Foundation's Gavin Kelly recently highlighted. It is vital to increase demand for skills, while investing in the productive potential of low-wage workers.</p> <p>At the same time, it is clear that only systemic institutional reforms will reverse the low wage, low skill, low productivity \"equilibrium\" in the British economy. This was an opportunity missed during the New Labour years, but it is a challenge the party must now take on.</p>",

It is endangered.\" ChiYong An, his colleague, added: \"Policymakers are not aware of the speed of destruction of the DMZ.\"</p> <p>The effects are already being felt. On one island in the area, there used to be a population of 300 swan goose \u2013 now there are fewer than 60, An said.</p> <p>Hong Koo Lee, former prime minister of South Korea, chairs the organising committee for the 10,000-participant <a href=\"http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/\" title=\"\">World Conservation Congress</a>, the four-yearly meeting of the IUCN, hosted here as part of the government's programme for green economic growth. He said the future of the DMZ was a major concern for the Korean government: \"We have most successfully conserved the land in the DMZ \u2013 I don't find anywhere else like this in the world. We want to preserve it.\" However, key issues remain to be addressed \u2013 not least what will happen to the outskirts of the zone, where biodiversity is coming under increasing threat from encroachment.</p> <p>Only 4km wide, the core of the DMZ extends all the way across Korea \u2013 a distance of 248 km. The only people allowed to walk this mine-strewn wilderness are a small number of patrolling soldiers marked out in special gear that shows they are not planning aggression.</p> <p>Beyond the 2km line on each side, bordered by barbed wire fences, there is a further zone varying from about 7km to more than 15km in width, either side of the border, known as the civilian restricted zone. While outside the demilitarised zone proper, this is far from a normal space \u2013 there are strict controls on who can enter and for what purpose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395924018\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/4/13/1334314428492/Wildlife-in-Korean-Demili-007.jpg\" alt=\"Wildlife in Korean Demilitarized Zone , DMZ : Manchurian cranes\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchurian cranes with their distinctive black and white feathers fly low over fields in Chulwon valley, just south of the Korean Demilitarized Zone.

As a long strip across Korea, the zone encompasses a rich variety of landscapes \u2013 from coastal and river areas, surrounded by wetlands, to high wooded mountains and lush slopes inland. The cranes \u2013 including the <a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/white-naped-crane/grus-vipio/\" title=\"\">white-naped</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/japanese-crane/grus-japonensis/\" title=\"\">Manchurian crane</a>, listed as vulnerable and endangered respectively by IUCN \u2013 are among a host of migratory birds that come to winter, while permanent residents include the leopard cat, several types of deer, and in the mountains black bears and the rare amur goral, an ungulate. Snakes and reptiles, some of them very rare, also abound, and amphibians including the endangered Korean golden frog. Unfortunately, by the time the DMZ was set up, it was already too late to save Korea's tiger population, wiped out before the war.</p> <p>After the 1953 armistice, the security situation remained highly volatile, and people were strongly dissuaded from entering the restricted zone surrounding the DMZ proper. In the 1970s, the discovery of tunnels from North Korea, preparations for a possible invasion, heightened the sense of threat and the controls were strictly kept. Only a few people were allowed in from South Korea, with special licences from the government, and often they had to obey a curfew and return every sunset.</p> <p>It took two more decades for the threat to recede, but since 2000 there has been a noticeable thawing of relations. There are now even a handful of commuter buses that run North and South, to and from factories set up by southern companies in the north, where labour is cheaper. Though welcome to the stressed populations of both countries, this has spelt major change for the controlled zone. As the border has become safer, people \u2013 often the original landowners who were removed after the war \u2013 have returned in greater numbers, with more permits being granted by the government and fewer restrictions on where and what they can do.</p> <p>The results are obvious, as rice fields and plantations of ginseng crowd the wetlands bordering the DMZ. Many of these fields are not new \u2013 some date back centuries \u2013 but have been reclaimed for intense production.</p> <p>SeoungHo Kim, director of the South Korean government-funded DMZ Ecology Research Institute, points to some fields punctuated by large spits of woodland. \"All of that is owned by the same person, who would like to develop the woodland too, but there are mines in it,\" he says.</p> <p>An over-zealous reclamation of the land risks returning the restricted zone to the same intensive agriculture that characterises the rest of the region, which is not conducive to biodiversity, and would also leave the tiny strip of the DMZ exposed and vulnerable. Some of the new fields are surrounded with electric fences.</p> <p>For South Korea, this is a dilemma. An ancient country that has been invaded scores of times by its neighbours \u2013 China, Mongolia, Russia have all tried to seize power, and most recently Japan occupied the country from 1910 to 1945 \u2013 food security is an essential part of its national spirit. South Korea is 100% self-sufficient in rice, our guide proudly announces \u2013 adding that the only imports are for use as animal feed. As a mountainous country, with only 20% of the land area suitable for arable farming, that means putting the land under serious pressure, obvious in the countryside near Seoul, where densely packed paddyfields are bordered by bean plants and maize, so as not to waste an inch, and even roadside verges are planted with squashes and chillies.</p> <p>A further concern is that if the country is reunified \u2013 and South Korea's Unification Bridge, Village and Observatory, as well as the Peace Bell bell rung hourly at the last stop before the North, attest to its hope of doing just that \u2013 then this zone will be up for grabs. Hence the movement now building, both within Korea and among international NGOs and scientists, to have the DMZ declared an internationally protected site.</p> <p>One key opportunity was to have this week's congress pass a resolution on protected status. Those hopes have been dashed, however. Lee, chairman of the organising committee, said: \"We asked for discussions on this matter at Congress, but we are very careful because this is a question between North and South Korea [which are jointly responsible for the DMZ]. We hoped the North Korean delegation would attend but for whatever reason, they could not.\"</p> <p>That means there can be no resolution of the issue at the conference, and there is no discussion of the issue between the two states yet in sight. While governments stall, the prospects for the last great hope for Korea's ancestral biodiversity are being steadily eroded.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's development finance arm, the CDC, could play a significant role in boosting Zambia's economy and ending the country's reliance on overseas aid, a UK parliamentary committee said on Thursday.</p> <p>But the House of Commons international development committee criticised Zambia's record on public expenditure, particularly its subsidy scheme for maize, which amounts to 8% of its budget and far exceeds the UK's bilateral aid programme. The money could be better spent on education, said its report on the southern African state.</p> <p>The committee said CDC investments through partners and directly into Zambian businesses would be good for the country and more appropriate than grants from the Department for International Development (DfID).</p> <p>By the end of 2011 the CDC, which is owned by DfID, had eight investments totalling \u00a35.2m through funds in Zambia. However, following <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-statements/2011/written-statement-to-the-house-of-commons-on-reform-of-cdc-group-plc/\" title=\"\">reform of the body</a> last year \u2013 designed to move it away from third-party investments through fund managers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jan/19/commonwealth-development-corporation-private-sector\" title=\"\">to more direct investments</a> in \"riskier\" projects in poorer countries \u2013 the committee said the CDC clearly had a \"major role\" to play in Zambia. It recommended the institution work more closely with DfID.</p> <p>\"We see a major role for the organisation in initially co-investing and subsequently directly investing in Zambian businesses,\" said the report. \"This will generally be more appropriate than DfID providing grants for private businesses.\"</p> <p>Zambia has experienced huge economic growth over the past decade. According to World Bank classifications, <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/country/zambia\" title=\"\">Zambia is now considered a lower middle-income country</a>. Countries in this category have per capita gross national incomes of between $1,006 and $3,975 a year.</p> <p>The country is also less dependent on overseas aid. The average annual ratio of overseas development assistance disbursements to GDP fell from an average of 22% between 1990 and 2005 to 5.6% in 2010. The UK is a major donor, spending \u00a354.7m on programmes in 2010/11, a sum expected to increase to \u00a363m by 2014/15.</p> <p>However, despite this growth, the country is still ranked 164 out of 187 in the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/\" title=\"\">2011 UN Human Development Index</a> and is off-track to meet many of the millennium development goals (MDGs) by 2015, including MDG1 to halve poverty and MDG5 to reduce maternal mortality rates, which remain high.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging report on DfID programmes in Zambia, the committee welcomed the department's increased spending on reproductive and maternal and newborn health, and urged it to encourage the Zambian government to allow people other than health professionals to be trained to give out contraception, particularly implants and injections.</p> <p>But, along with cuts to the public sector wage bill, the report called for an end to maize subsidies, which MPs said was \"one of the biggest issues that the Zambian government has to confront\".</p> <p>Record maize harvests in 2010 meant the government was forced to spend $280m on 840,000 metric tons of maize, making a $140m loss. The problem was repeated in 2011.</p> <p>The committee urged the government to phase out the subsidy, although it acknowledged such a move would be fiercely opposed. The money saved from the subsidy cut could be spent on free secondary and tertiary education, said MPs. Education in Zambia is free until the age of 14.</p> <p>The chairman of the committee, Malcolm Bruce, said: \"The Zambian economy has grown significantly over the last 10 years, but the country is still one of the poorest in the world and will not meet many of the millennium development goals without a renewed focus on maternal mortality, secondary education and rural poverty.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>He added: \"The economy is improving in Zambia but, if the country is to succeed in creating a modern economy, more needs to be done to improve secondary education.\"</p>"
