  "<p>The Institute of Directors is to put further pressure on George Osborne by urging him to take urgent steps to promote investment, as it says business is \"battening down the hatches\" for the rest of the year.</p> <p>The IoD said most firms had delayed investment decisions and employing new staff after taking the view that growth this year would be worse than last year.</p> <p>\"Business is battening down the hatches in the expectation that the recession will continue for the rest of the year. That is bad news for the economy at large, because decisions to invest money or take on more staff are being postponed until things look up,\" Graham Leach, chief economist at the IoD, said. \"Low confidence leads to delayed decisions, and delayed decisions further undermine economic confidence \u2013 it's a vicious cycle.\"</p> <p>Leach said the government's agenda was \"pointing in broadly the right direction, but the overwhelming opinion of our members is that they are doing too little, too slowly\". He called for cuts to red tape and simplification of employment law to \"make a real difference to the cost and complexity of doing business in the UK\".</p> <p>The sharp fall in manufacturing output revealed on Tuesday added to the gloom following a survey by the CBI that revealed expectations for growth during the autumn have evaporated.</p> <p>The figures are a blow to the chancellor, who has seen his forecasts for deficit reduction and growth skid wildly off track. Analysts said that by next April Osborne could overshoot his spending target by up to \u00a340bn if growth continues to flatline and government spending outstrips tax receipts, forcing him to accept higher debt levels or consider further austerity measures.</p> <p>The Institute of Directors said a poll of its members revealed a lack of confidence in the government's growth forecasts. It said most firms had delayed investment decisions and employing new staff after taking the view that growth this year would be worse than last year.</p> <p>The IoD joined a wide range of business lobby groups and opposition parties to call on Osborne to promote investment and growth to prevent the recession dragging into the second half of the year.Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Rachel Reeves, said the chancellor's promise to secure the recovery and get the deficit down was in tatters. \"His failed plan has delivered the exact opposite - a double dip recession which is leading to soaring borrowing. What more evidence does the government need that their plan has failed and they need to change course?\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChukaUmunna/status/237834865582682112\" title=\"\">Shadow business secretary Chuka Ummuna tweeted</a>: \"Yet more evidence of the Government's economic incompetence but will Cameron, Clegg, Cable and co change course?\"</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing, excluding bank bailouts, showed a deficit of \u00a3557m, compared with a \u00a32.8bn surplus in the same month last year. Analysts had been expecting a surplus of \u00a32.5bn. The data heightens concerns that the government will miss its deficit reduction target.</p> <p>The ONS said the total deficit since April had reached \u00a347.2bn \u2013 up \u00a311.6bn on 2011 \u2013 excluding financial interventions and a one-off boost after assets from the Royal Mail's pension fund were transferred to the Treasury. Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the figures \"continue the deterioration seen over the past few months. At this rate, borrowing for 2012/13 overall will massively overshoot the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast of \u00a3120bn, excluding Royal Mail effects, by over \u00a335bn.</p> <p>\"And with the recovery falling well short of the OBR's expectations, we think that the government will struggle to cut borrowing at all next year.\"</p> <p>July is usually a buoyant month for tax receipts, but this year the corporate sector has been hit hard by the downturn. ONS figures showed North Sea oil and gas output has been unusually low, leading to lower profits and a cut in tax payments.</p> <p>The impact of a near 20% drop in corporation tax receipts was to push government receipts down 0.8% in July on the same period last year.</p> <p>Government spending, meanwhile, grew 5.1% on the previous year, mostly on welfare payments. Lower revenues from oil and gas companies accounted for about \u00a31bn of a \u00a31.7bn shortfall in corporation tax compared with last year.</p> <p>The government had planned to eliminate the structural budget deficit by 2015 with a tough programme of spending cuts and tax rises.</p> <p>It has eliminated a quarter of the deficit so far, though this figure is in line with Labour's pre-election target and not the more aggressive plans outlined by George Osborne in the summer of 2010.</p> <p>Osborne has failed to meet his own targets and his tougher austerity programme and the weak economy have forced him to extend the planned fiscal consolidation by another two years. David Cameron has warned austerity could last until 2020.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman blamed a cut in North Sea oil production for the bulk of the fall in corporation tax receipts. He said it was expected that government spending would increase in response to the \"weakening global economy\" and higher welfare spending, but it was still too early in the financial year to draw firm conclusions about the year as a whole.</p> <p>\"The government remains committed to the credible plan we have set out to deal with Britain's debts, and today's numbers emphasise how risky it would be to deliberately increase borrowing,\" he said.</p> <p>Manufacturers responding to the CBI's monthly industrial trends survey pointed to prolonged weakness in the economy. A balance of -21% of firms saying orders are falling compared with those saying orders are up represents the lowest return since the end of last year.</p> <p>The CBI said: \"Similarly, export orders have weakened with manufacturers reporting a balance of -17%. While still above the long-run average of -21%, this is the lowest figure reported since January 2012, when it reached -26%.\"Anna Leach of the CBI said: \"The economic environment for UK manufacturers remains challenging, with domestic demand relatively muted and the ongoing eurozone crisis now seeming to drag on broader global economic momentum.\"</p>",
  "<p>Foxconn, Apple's top manufacturer, has improved safety conditions and cut working hours in an effort to resolve violations at its plants that triggered a global scandal for the iPad and iPhone maker.</p> <p>The Taiwanese company submitted to an audit by an independent group, the Fair Labor Association (FLA), after reports of suicides and abusive conditions at several of its factories in China.</p> <p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, asked the FLA to investigate after a series of reports into working conditions at Apple's key supplier. In February and march the FLA found at least 50 violations of local regulations at Foxconn plants in Chengdu, Guanlan and Longhua.</p> <p>The FLA said Foxconn had made significant improvements such as introducing more breaks and better maintenance of safety equipment. The company more than doubled wages after protests from worker groups and is backing a local law adjustment that will extend unemployment insurance.</p> <p>Foxconn had completed all the 195 actions that were due at the time of the FLA's report and another 89 action items were completed ahead of their deadline, according to the FLA. Another 76 actions are due over the course of the next year.</p> <p>But the FLA said Foxconn faces more challenges in the coming months. Foxconn has reduced hours to under 60 per week including overtime and is aiming to reach full compliance with the Chinese legal limit of 40 hours per week plus an average of nine hours of overtime per week.</p> <p>\"The next phase of improvements will be challenging for Foxconn because they involve major changes in the working environment that will inevitably cause uncertainty and anxiety among workers. As Foxconn prepares to comply with the Chinese legal limits on work hours, consultation with workers on the changes and implications will be critical to a successful transition,\" said FLA president Auret van Heerden.</p> <p>Foxconn is the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer. As well as being Apple's largest supplier Foxconn, which employs about a million people, makes products for Sony, Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems and others.</p> <p>Criticism of the company has been mounting for years. In 2009 a 25-year-old worker committed suicide, reportedly after losing an iPhone prototype. After a spate of suicides Foxconn installed nets around the edges of some buildings to prevent people jumping off roofs.</p> <p>In January following a New York Times article that documented problems inside its supplier factories Cook emailed staff worldwide to say: \"we care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain. Any accident is deeply troubling, and any issue with working conditions is cause for concern. Any suggestion that we don't care is patently false and offensive to us.\"</p>",
  "<p>Considering he made his name with the biggest leak of secret government documents in history, you might imagine there would be at least some residual concern for Julian Assange among those trading in the freedom of information business. But the virulence of British media hostility towards the WikiLeaks founder is now unrelenting.</p> <p>This is a man, after all, who has yet to be charged, let alone convicted, of anything. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/21/rights-groups-lost-plot-ecuador\" title=\"\">as far as the bulk of the press is concerned</a>, Assange is nothing but a \"monstrous narcissist\", a bail-jumping \"sex pest\" and an exhibitionist maniac. After Ecuador granted him political asylum and Assange delivered a \"tirade\" from its London embassy's balcony, fire was turned on the country's progressive president, Rafael Correa, ludicrously branded a corrupt \"dictator\" with an \"iron grip\" on a benighted land.</p> <p>The ostensible reason for this venom is of course Assange's attempt to resist extradition to Sweden (and onward extradition to the US) over sexual assault allegations \u2013 including from newspapers whose record on covering rape and violence against women is shaky, to put it politely. But as the row over his embassy refuge has escalated into a major diplomatic stand-off, with the whole of South America piling in behind Ecuador, such posturing looks increasingly specious.</p> <p>Can anyone seriously believe the dispute would have gone global, or that the British government would have made its asinine threat to suspend the Ecuadorean embassy's diplomatic status and enter it by force, or that scores of police would have surrounded the building, swarming up and down the fire escape and guarding every window, if it was all about one man wanted for questioning over sex crime allegations in Stockholm?</p> <p>To get a grip on what is actually going on, rewind to WikiLeaks' explosive release of secret US military reports and hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables two years ago. They disgorged devastating evidence of US war crimes and collusion with death squads in Iraq on an industrial scale, the machinations and lies of America's wars and allies, its illegal US spying on UN officials \u2013 as well as a compendium of official corruption and deceit across the world.</p> <p>WikiLeaks provided fuel for the Arab uprisings. It didn't just deliver information for citizens to hold governments everywhere to account, but crucially opened up the exercise of US global power to democratic scrutiny. Not surprisingly, the US government made clear it regarded WikiLeaks as a serious threat to its interests from the start, denouncing the release of confidential US cables as a \"criminal act\".</p> <p>Vice-president Joe Biden has compared Assange to a \"hi-tech terrorist\". Shock jocks and neocons have called for him to be hunted down and killed. Bradley Manning, the 24-year-old soldier accused of passing the largest trove of US documents to WikiLeaks, who has been held in conditions described as \"cruel and inhuman\" by the&#xa0;UN special rapporteur on torture, faces up to 52 years in prison.</p> <p>The US administration yesterday claimed the WikiLeaks founder was trying to deflect attention from his Swedish case by making \"wild allegations\" about US intentions. But the idea that the threat of US extradition is some paranoid WikiLeaks fantasy is absurd.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/06/09/wikileaks_27/\" title=\"\">grand jury in Virginia</a> has been preparing a case against Assange and WikiLeaks for espionage, a leak earlier this year suggested that the US government has already <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-condemns-reported-sealed-indictment-against-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange\" title=\"\">issued a secret sealed indictment against Assange</a>, while Australian diplomats have reported that the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/us-targets-wikileaks-like-no-other-organisation-20111202-1obeo.html\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks founder is the target of an investigation that is \"unprecedented both in its scale and its nature\"</a>.</p> <p>The US interest in deterring others from following the WikiLeaks path is obvious. And it would be bizarre to expect a state which over the past decade has kidnapped, tortured and illegally incarcerated its enemies, real or imagined, on a global scale \u2013 and continues to do so under President Barack Obama \u2013 to walk away from what Hillary Clinton described as an \"attack on the international community\". In the meantime, the US authorities are presumably banking on seeing Assange further discredited in Sweden.</p> <p>None of that should detract from the seriousness of the rape allegations made against Assange, for which he should clearly answer and, if charges are brought, stand trial. The question is how to achieve justice for the women involved while protecting Assange (and&#xa0;other whistleblowers) from punitive extradition to a legal system that could potentially land him in a US prison cell for decades.</p> <p>The politicisation of the Swedish case&#xa0;was clear from the initial leak of the allegations to the prosecutor's decision to seek Assange's extradition for questioning \u2013 described by a <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/48396086/Assange-Case-Opionion-Sven-Erik-Alhem\" title=\"\">former Stockholm prosecutor as \"unreasonable,&#xa0;unfair and disproportionate\"</a> \u2013 when&#xa0;the&#xa0;authorities have been happy&#xa0;to interview suspects abroad in&#xa0;more serious cases.</p> <p>And given the context, it's also hardly surprising that sceptics have raised the links with US-funded anti-Cuban opposition groups of one of those making the accusations \u2013 or that campaigners such as the London-based Women Against Rape have expressed scepticism at the \"unusual zeal\" with which rape allegations were pursued against Assange in a country where rape convictions have fallen. The danger, of course, is that the murk around this case plays into a misogynist culture in which rape&#xa0;victims aren't believed.</p> <p>But why, Assange's critics charge, would he be more likely to be extradited to the US from Sweden than from Britain, Washington's patsy, notorious for its one-sided extradition arrangements. There are specific risks in Sweden \u2013 for example, its fast-track \"temporary surrender\" extradition agreement it has with the US. But the real point is that Assange is in danger of&#xa0;extradition in both countries \u2013&#xa0;which&#xa0;is why Ecuador was right to offer him protection.</p> <p>The solution is obvious. It's the one that Ecuador is proposing \u2013 and that London and Stockholm are resisting. If the Swedish government pledged to block the extradition of Assange to the US for any WikiLeaks-related offence (which it has the power to do) \u2013 and Britain agreed not to sanction extradition to a third country once Swedish proceedings are over \u2013 then justice could be served. But with loyalty to the US on the line, Assange shouldn't expect to leave the embassy any time soon.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article will be turned on in the morning</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The head of Glencore's food trading business has said the worst drought to hit the US since the 1930s will be \"good for Glencore\" because it will lead to opportunities to exploit soaring prices.</p> <p>Chris Mahoney, the trader's director of agricultural products, who owns about \u00a3500m of Glencore shares, said the devastating US drought had created an opportunity for the company to make much more money.</p> <p>\"In terms of the outlook for the balance of the year, the environment is a good one. High prices, lots of volatility, a lot of dislocation, tightness, a lot of arbitrage opportunities [the purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from price differences in different markets],\" he said on a conference call .</p> <p>Mahoney said Glencore, which reported pre-tax profits of $2.2bn (\u00a31.4bn), would be able to exploit the drought to its advantage, especially after its takeover of Canadian grain trader Viterra. \"I think we will both be able to provide the world with solutions, getting stuff to where it's needed quickly and timely, and that should be good for Glencore.\"</p> <p>The blistering heat in the US has destroyed 45% of the corn and 35% of the soya bean crop, pushing the price of the commodities to record highs. Overall global food prices rose by 6% in July, according to the UN.</p> <p>The drought is so severe that G20 nations are considering holding a crisis summit. The last severe food crisis, in 2008, sparked riots in cities from the Caribbean to the far east. The United Nations food agency warned this month that \"there is potential for a situation to develop like we had back in 2007-08.\" Abdolreza Abbassian, senior economist and grain analyst at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, told Reuters: \"There is an expectation that this time around we will not pursue bad policies and intervene in the market by restrictions, and if that doesn't happen we will not see such a serious situation as 2007-08.

  "<p>'Just don't be in the toilet when we dive deep,\" executive officer David \"Bing\" Crosby advises me. \"The bulkheads bend and you can't open the doors.\" Forget all the technical stuff about monitoring \"the Bubble\" when you dive \u2013 I never quite understand the role of that mysterious piece of equipment \u2013 this is&#xa0;the kind of practical guidance I need. I vow to stick close to Bing, second-in-command on the nuclear submarine <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Triumph_(S93)\" title=\"\">HMS Triumph</a>, and a funny, down-to-earth bloke. \"It's like having children,\" he says as the younger officers grapple for space at the first morning briefing I&#xa0;attend. \"I've got children, and sometimes I think they're worse.\" This seems to be meant affectionately.</p> <p>I have been on the boat \u2013 submarines are always called boats, never ships \u2013 for less than 24 hours and am writing this log at a depth of 60m. Sorry, I spoke too soon. We are just rising to periscope depth \u2013 18m below the surface \u2013 and the tall desk on which I am typing has started to list. At least I'm not in the toilet. I joined HMS Triumph in Crete for the final week of its 10-month deployment. I had never been on a submarine before and don't especially like confined spaces. I plan to get off at Gibraltar six days from now, though the captain warns me this may not be possible if there is fog as the launch can't come alongside.</p> <p>HMS Triumph distinguished itself last year in Libya, firing missiles at Gaddafi's key installations, including the one which hit the colonel's compound. The submarine's captain, Robert Dunn, feels they have been largely written out of the Libyan campaign and is keen his crew get their due. \"If it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soul alive,\" he tells me over breakfast, quoting Henry V. \"Faint hearts never fucked a pig\" is another of his maxims, which may be a translation from Clausewitz's On War. The book sits on a&#xa0;narrow shelf in his small cabin beside the control room.</p> <p>This is Capt Dunn's final command; in fact his very last week at sea. At 48, and after three years in charge of HMS Triumph, he will be getting a desk job. It is also Chief Petty Officer Simon Johnson's final week at sea. There is a nice moment during my week aboard when the submarine (never sub, an egregious Americanism) has to surface to pass through the Straits of Messina. We go through at sunrise and Chief Johnson, who is up on the bridge, tells me it's the first time he has sailed past Stromboli since he was on the frigate HMS Leander at the start of his naval career 30 years ago. The volcano has bookended his life at sea.</p> <p>I ask Chief Johnson why he switched from surface ships to submarines. \"I got drafted in 1983 and didn't have any choice,\" he says. \"I tried to get out of it. I didn't want to be a submariner. If you ask a general service chap what they think about submarines, they'll say: 'Horrible, dirty, noisy, you can't have a shower, you're always stinking.' Well, in the old days that might have been the case \u2013 water was very restricted \u2013 but you can see yourself; conditions are not that bad. On my first boat, Spartan, at the back end of 1983, it all clicked \u2013 it was a completely different way of life from general service.\"</p> <p>He goes on to cite what most submariners say is what they like about life beneath the waves: the relative informality. There are, of course, distinctions between officers and ranks, but in so confined a space nothing like the rigidities of surface ships; the sense of being an elite, what one able seaman calls a \"brotherhood\"; the camaraderie that comes from knowing they rely entirely on each other. When a man, whether officer or rating, becomes a submariner, he is awarded a badge formed from two dolphins and a crown. The badge admits you to an exclusive club \u2013 there are around 3,500&#xa0;operational submariners in the UK. It means that, in the event of an emergency, you will be a help, rather than a hindrance. Until then, in the uncompromising language of submariners, you are an \"oxygen thief\".</p> <p>\"Everyone who wears the dolphins badge has a common ethos, common training and a common focus,\" says Lieutenant Stuart Keillor, an impressive 31-year-old Scot who will one day command a submarine. \"No one does this job unless they want to. There's a lot of willpower in putting yourself into this environment for a long period. There's a lot of loyalty; and for that reason I'm very comfortable with my shipmates. There's a high expectation of the trainees that come on here. They've got a lot to prove, but once they're in the club, you&#xa0;can be confident they've reached a&#xa0;certain standard.\"</p> <p>I know I will never be in the club. Climbing the ladders between decks exhausts me; I am forever hitting my head on protruding bits of metal; and once in the control room, while leaning against the periscope, I stumble backwards and accidentally press a button. Luckily, it is the button that says \"search\" and not the one next to it that says \"attack\". I don't want to be responsible for a missile assault on Algeria, to which we happen to be close at the time.</p> <p>The submarine is two separate worlds: the front half, where the men (and at the moment it is all men, though there are likely to be female submariners from next year) sleep and eat and make war; and the back half, where the nuclear reactor sits beneath the tunnel that separates for'ard from back'aft and where the engines are. I don't spent much time back'aft, but I do visit for a back'afties' treat \u2013 potatoes baked on the engine throttle. At a crude level, a submarine crew is divided into those who make war and those who make the engines work. \"We push, they fight,\" as one back'aftie explains succinctly.</p> <p>The engineers call the nuclear reactor \"the big kettle\". It is what enables one of these fast-attack submarines to go on long operations, with no need to come into port for refuelling. Having it on board is a huge responsibility, as HMS Triumph's marine engineering officer, Lieutenant Commander Andy Sharp, makes clear. \"It's never going to explode,\" he says when I ask him what's the worst thing that could happen, \"but it could melt. If a nuclear submarine had an accident that caused it to have a slump and melt and drop out the bottom of the boat, I don't think we'd have a nuclear fleet any more. That would be the end of nuclear submarines. It's that level of responsibility.\" That pressure is enormous, but it works: to its credit, the navy has managed, over half a century, to run a fleet of submarines without a major incident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395503415\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564538828/HMS-Triumphs-cramped-cond-010.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Triumph's cramped conditions\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HMS Triumph's cramped conditions add to the claustrophia. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A key distinction to grasp is between fast-attack submarines such as HMS Triumph, which are armed with conventional cruise missiles (the UK has seven such boats in varying degrees of readiness), and the four nuclear-armed submarines, one of which is always on patrol, ready to unleash its Trident nuclear missiles if apocalypse beckons. The latter \u2013 called ballistic submarines or bombers \u2013 are, at 180m long, almost twice the size of Triumph, have bigger crews and are, according to the men who have served on them, deadly boring. \"Their job is to stay silent,\" says one petty officer. \"You have no contact with the outside world.\" The bombers stay at a constant depth, move very slowly and do everything to avoid detection. It is three months of suspended animation; 180 men aspiring to the life of a flat fish, though a highly educated one \u2013 many are doing Open University degrees to pass the time and improve themselves.</p> <p>Another man tells me the crew on board one bomber used to amuse themselves by pretending to be motorbikes, and this rings true. \"Spinning a dit\" is a phrase you hear a lot on board HMS Triumph. It means telling a tale \u2013 a tale that grows with the telling. Even on a fast-attack sub, if there is nothing to attack and you grow tired of listening to passing whales and pretending to target nearby destroyers, life can get repetitive, so the men slip into other worlds. One of the crew has a large tattoo on his back: \"Never stop me dreaming,\" which might stand as a motto for all of them.</p> <p>One evening, I wander into the control room at about midnight. The watch officer and sonar operators are discussing an important philosophical question: would it be more painful to be struck by a whole tuna or a tin of tuna? This is never resolved. These epistemological issues can be sustained over weeks.</p> <p>On my fourth day aboard, I make my greatest discovery: that a badger, washed into the bilge tank in Bahrain, is being kept back'aft. There is a roster to feed it, and somehow it is being kept alive. I insist on seeing it \u2013 what a wonderful story! Of course, say the back'afties, come by this evening. After&#xa0;a couple of hours, even in my dim-witted, mind-clouded, headachy state, I realise I have been conned. Do they even have badgers in Bahrain?</p> <p>But the fantasy has become important to some of the crew. \"It helps pass the time,\" the head badger-keeper tells me. \"It takes the edge off the situation,\" says one of the senior ratings. \"If you get into a situation that's a bit tense, mentioning the badger brings everything back down to earth. If you tried to remain alert 100% of the time it would fatigue you. The ability to relax allows you, when required, to be on the ball.\" It's the ability to switch instantly from badger mode to potential nuclear meltdown mode that defines a good crew.</p> <p>This is a highly segregated society, yet also a very organic one. There are three separate messes, for officers, senior ratings and junior ratings, each situated on the short corridor that serves as the men's living space. The separate messes with their different atmospheres \u2013 the Xbox is never off in the junior rates mess \u2013 suggest division, yet everything else implies unity. The pay structure is relatively flat: Capt Dunn earns around \u00a385,000; the most junior rating gets \u00a330,000. What other organisation has that sort of ratio between top and bottom? And every crew member, officer or rating, has to know everything about the boat \u2013 the function of every one of the thousands of valves. There are half a dozen trainees on the boat studying for their dolphin badges, and they are forgoing all sleep to memorise the handbook they have been given in time for a test that could be sprung on them at any time.</p> <p>Chief Petty Officer Paul \"Jakie\" Foran, the likable but occasionally terrifying Scot who oversees these tests, expects dedication, and woe betide any trainee (AKA oxygen thief) who is discovered having a cup of tea in the junior rates' mess when he could be unearthing the secret of the magazine spray drench system. \"To me you're useless until you're qualified,\" says Chief Foran. \"I'm a bastard, but in a nice way.\"</p> <p>You learn early whether you will&#xa0;survive in this world. One young officer who wants to transfer from surface ships is aboard studying for his dolphins, and is reckoned to have too many airs and graces. The crew are merciless in mocking this affront to their democratic values. He expects to be shown where every valve is and what it's for; don't be absurd (or words to that effect), says Chief Foran, you must find out for yourself. Forget sleep.</p> <p>Forgetting sleep is easy. The crew work 12 hours a day, split into six-hour watches, with changeovers at 1 and 7. Back'afties, because of the heat in which they're working, have shorter but more frequent shifts. When they're not working, most men will be in their \"rack\", but sleeping on a submarine is no fun. The captain, alone on the boat, gets his own cabin; the senior officers share; and everyone else is in hot, cramped, fetid dormitories. Bed space is so limited that some of the most junior ratings have to \"hot bunk\", sleeping in the bed vacated by a man who has just gone on watch.</p> <p>You can hardly move in the bunk \u2013 sitting up is impossible \u2013 and if you turn over you are likely to tip out and end up on the floor. You have to share your rack with a gas mask and various other bits of safety equipment, plus a lot of your own gear. There are small lockers, but I am never offered one, so sleep with bag, clothes and shoes in the bed. Each bunk has an air vent, which does offer some respite from the&#xa0;heat but also blows a blast of cold air into your right ear. \"If the air stops&#xa0;blowing, it means something bad&#xa0;has happened,\" one of the men tells me reassuringly. One morning I&#xa0;am woken by a sudden thud and fear&#xa0;the worst. Later, I discover it was&#xa0;just air being released \u2013 a routine&#xa0;operation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395503416\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/21/1345564222884/TCPO-Tug-Wilson-in-sleepi-010.jpg\" alt=\"TCPO 'Tug' Wilson in sleeping quaters in the weapons room\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TCPO \u2018Tug\u2019 Wilson in the weapons room (AKA \u2018bomb shop\u2019). Crew members often hug the cruise missiles to stay cool while they sleep. Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Several men mention \"coffin dreams\" \u2013 nightmares in which the sleeper shouts out that the control room is flooding or he is being pursued by a torpedo. I sympathise: though I have no nightmares \u2013 I don't sleep deeply enough for that \u2013 the racks do feel like coffins. A better option is to sleep in the \"bomb shop\", where the missiles and torpedoes are kept. It is the quietest, most spacious room on the boat and hugging an 18ft cruise missile keeps you cool.</p> <p>A few men go \"wibble\" after years under water; they just can't stand it any more \u2013 the lack of proper sleep, the&#xa0;absence of privacy, the endlessly repeated conversations, the cycle of meals (it's Wednesday so it must be curry), the unspoken dangers. How do you know when someone has gone wibble? \"The noisy ones go quiet, and&#xa0;the quiet ones suddenly become noisy,\" one man tells me. Chief Johnson recalls one experienced submariner who went wibble and started keeping a&#xa0;book of shipmates he thought had wronged him. \"You're on my list as well,\" he told Johnson before being taken off the boat. He only agreed to leave as long as he could be designated captain of the rescue vessel.</p> <p>The men who go doolally are, however, the exceptions. Most get into&#xa0;a routine \u2013 working, sleeping (as best they can), reading (Kindles are a&#xa0;godsend in this confined world), watching films, spinning dits and dripping. Dripping is another key part of the submariner's lexicon: it means moaning, usually in a lighthearted way&#xa0;and often about the food. \"Ah, you&#xa0;found the one mushroom in the mushroom soup,\" says Lieutenant Gareth Batsford, who as well as being the resident film buff in the officers' mess is also one of the boat's aphorists. \"You wouldn't believe the inability of well-educated, well-trained Royal Navy officers to change bloody toilet rolls,\" he drips at one point.</p> <p>I penetrate many aspects of submarine life in my six days aboard, but&#xa0;sex remains elusive. \"There's a saying \u2013 what happens at sea stays at sea,\" says medical assistant Richard Bastianpulle teasingly. \"I've not really thought about it, except when I'm in bed \u2026 by myself. People let off steam when they come alongside. I'll let you&#xa0;read between the lines on that.\" The boat will usually come into port every two months or so to pick up provisions, and the men \u2013 the single men at least \u2013 can get quite frisky.</p> <p>There is one openly gay man on board. \"They don't treat me any different to anyone else,\" he says. \"I&#xa0;didn't tell anyone at first. I let them ask me rather than me tell them. But it's better to be open and honest than to try and deny it. People will catch you out and they'll start spreading malicious rumours.\" He gets ribbed about his sexuality, but says everyone gets ribbed about something. \"Ribbing doesn't bother me. I let it go over my head. Some days it'll get to you, but you have to brush it off and forget about it.\"</p> <p>The key thing is that bantering must never turn into bullying. The navy, which has become alert to equality and&#xa0;diversity in the past decade, is now good at stamping out bullying, which would destroy the esprit de corps in a community this small and close-knit. Christopher Herbert, a 34-year-old from St Vincent, who I discover up in the dry provisions store mixing his own rap song (The Vagina Rap) on a computer, says he has never suffered racial abuse on the boat. \"It's zero tolerance,\" he says.</p> <p>On my last night in the officers' mess we watch Operation Petticoat, an&#xa0;old submarine film with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis. They must have seen&#xa0;it a dozen times, but love it. The&#xa0;officers \u2013 especially Lieutenant Commander Crosby, who misses his young children hugely \u2013 cry easily during movies. Andy Sharp gives his recipe for the sort of movie that plays well on board, especially with the back'afties: \"Some token violence, some top bollocks on view from time to time, definitely some love interest, a&#xa0;car chase, and it must have a happy ending.\" Most of these teak-like submariners, even Chief Foran, are softies at heart.</p> <p>I do manage to get off at Gibraltar, two miles off the coast in a heavyish swell. A dinghy comes alongside, bashing against the side of the submarine, and one of the crew pushes me&#xa0;into it. The timing of the leap is crucial. Get it wrong and you will be dripping in a literal sense. I end up upside down in the dinghy and wrench my shoulder. I'm just not built to be a&#xa0;submariner, and seem to lack Cary Grant's swagger. I am loaded on to a small patrol vessel, which pipes its salutation to the departing submarine. I am relieved to be breathing fresh air, yet sad not to be heading home with HMS Triumph. As a parting gift, the captain has given me an honorary dolphins badge, and I will treasure it always. Despite all my shortcomings, I&#xa0;feel I was starting to become part of the life of the boat. Me and the badger.</p>",
  "<p>Hi there! Wasn't the weekend lovely? So warm and sunny with just a light breeze on which you could hear the gentle whisper \"Rape ... rape ... rape \u2026\" Rape does seem to be in the air these days, what with the Republican party in the US, certain devotees of Julian Assange around the world, and lazy comedians in Edinburgh, all talking quite a lot about it without apparently having a clue what it is. So let's clear things up. Welcome to Rape: The Idiot's Primer.</p> <h2><strong>Rape is rape is rape</strong><br></h2> <p>It is testament to the determination of some folk to bend reality to their preferred viewpoint that there are so many intriguing words around these days for rape to make it seem, I don't know, less rapey. Two years ago <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2010/12/is_sex_by_surprise_illegal_in_the_united_states.html\" title=\"\">\"sex by surprise\"</a>, nobody's favourite pudding (\"Would madam prefer the apple pie \u00e0 la mode, the tiramisu or the sex by surprise?\"), was the hot new coinage in reference to Assange but now there's a whole slew in the mix.</p> <p>The scientifically challenged Republican politician Todd Akin referred in a now-infamous <a href=\"fox2now.com/2012/08/19/the-jaco-report-august-19-2012/\" title=\"\">interview</a> to something called \"legitimate rape\" which, strangely, Akin seemed to use to refer to a particularly nasty rape because in those extreme circumstances \"the female body has ways of shutting [their reproductive organs] down.\" Now, leaving aside the question of how on earth a 65-year-old man with six children can be so clueless about female biology, this kind of differentiation between what's a Proper Rape and what's merely a Fake Rape is very popular in certain circles.</p> <p>The term Akin was groping for was not the contradictory \"legitimate rape\" but the tautological <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/04/14/158775/rep-nunnelee-rape-parenthood/\" title=\"\">\"forcible rape\"</a>, the term employed in <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3/text\" title=\"\">HR3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act</a>, which Akin co-sponsored, to refer to rapes that involve the woman being violently assaulted, as those are the only rapes that count, apparently. So if you're drugged and don't put up a fight resulting in you getting a black eye or something similar, good news! Your rape didn't count. Bad news! You won't get help paying for an abortion \u2013 not that you'll need one, mind, because pregnancies through rape don't happen, of course.</p> <p>Eventually, the term was dropped from the bill \u2013 which then passed \u2013 but it just so happens that <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/08/19/712251/how-todd-akin-and-paul-ryan-partnered-to-redefine-rape/?mobile=n\" title=\"\">Akin's co-sponsor on that measure</a> was current GOP VP nominee Paul Ryan. Akin later apologised for having <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/aug/19/health/la-pn-missouri-rep-todd-akin-says-he-misspoke-on-rape-and-pregnancy-20120819\" title=\"\">\"misspoke\"</a> about \"legitimate rape\" but the truth is all he had done was articulate the biological <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/#48732520\" title=\"\">ignorance and misogyny that is rife in his party</a>, the kind of thinking that lies behind so many of their policies and ambitions, as well as the even more common belief that some rapes count and some are acts sluts bring upon themselves.</p> <p>It's not just politicians. Whoopi Goldberg notoriously once said Roman Polanski hadn't committed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NX_D0Bv9M0\" title=\"\">\"rape-rape\"</a> back in 1977, although seeing that a 13-year-old child told how he drugged and sodomised her, I'd hate to know what Goldberg considers actual rape.</p> <p>This week George Galloway took to his <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/george-galloway-assange-only-accused-bad-sexual-etiquette\" title=\"\">video blog</a>, the apparently unironically named Good Night with George Galloway, to defend Assange, insisting what he is accused of \"isn't rape\" (it is), that all he is guilty of is \"bad sexual etiquette\" (George Galloway: today's Emily Post) and adding for good measure \"not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion\", especially if you're \"already in the sex game with them\". That's right, he used the word \"insertion\". Sweet dreams.</p> <h2><strong>Rape is not WikiLeaks</strong><br></h2> <p>This is just a little reminder to all of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/wikileaks-and-the-global-future-of-free-speech.html?_r=2\" title=\"\">Assange fans</a> out there (Assolytes? Assheads?) that Assange is not being charged for anything to do with WikiLeaks. Despite what <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-statement-ecuadorean-embassy-video\" title=\"\">he insinuated</a> in his amazingly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Spy3Nd2D6w\" title=\"\">Evita-like</a> balcony speech on Sunday from the Ecuadorean embassy, Assange is dodging rape accusations from two women. Not WikiLeaks. Women. Same first letter. Different things. Also, while you can \u2013 contrary to other certain beliefs \u2013 become pregnant if you are raped, you cannot become pregnant from WikiLeaks. Just to clarify. Next!</p> <h2><strong>It's not funny</strong><br></h2> <p>Every year in Britain, <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/violence-against-women-girls/strategic-vision/\" title=\"\">400,000 women</a> are sexually assaulted. More hard figures: 99.99% of all rape jokes aren't funny (we'll get to the .01% that are in a tick); 100% of attention-seeking, imagination-deficient comedians will make at least one rape joke in their lives. Numbers are fun!</p> <p>As Tanya Gold <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/heard-one-about-rape-funny-now\" title=\"\">wrote</a> in this paper, rape jokes are quite <em>la mode de la saison</em> up at the Edinburgh festival right now, but they have never been out of fashion on comedy circuits. The reliably unfunny \"comedian\" Daniel Tosh <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/us-news-blog/2012/jul/11/daniel-tosh-apologises-rape-joke\" title=\"\">got in a bit of trouble</a> earlier this summer for making one at the expense of an audience member (\"Wouldn't it be funny if that girl got raped by, like, five guys right now?\") and the only amazing thing about that incident was that he was reprimanded for it.</p> <p>If edgy comedy is supposed to provide an enlightening perspective on a horrible aspect of life then nearly all rape jokes fail, not least because they are often at the expense of the rape victim. The only funny rape-ish joke I've ever heard was from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys_Hi8nV7yM\" title=\"\">US comedian John Mulaney</a>, who mused on how women see him as a threat late at night, \"and it's weird because, like, I'm still afraid of being kidnapped\". Personally, I find that a lot more enlightening and, crucially, funnier than Jimmy Carr's \"What do nine out of 10 people enjoy? A gang rape.\" It also \u2013 unlike anything said by Akin, Ryan, Galloway, Carr or Assange's fans \u2013 shows awareness of the victim as opposed to focusing on the alleged (or, in this case, imagined) attacker. That's how you talk about rape, see? You remember that the victim is an actual person.</p> <p>Man, can you imagine the hilarity that would ensue if Carr and Galloway were ever to share a room? I honestly think my reproductive organs just shut down.</p>",
  "<p>Look after the economy and the deficit will look after itself. That was the advice John Maynard Keynes gave to governments during the Great Depression of the 1930s and, if he were alive today, it would be the advice he would be giving to George Osborne.</p> <p>The public finances are a mess because the economy is a mess. Deprived of the growth hormones of consumer debt and excessive financial-sector leverage, Britain has struggled to find new ways of earning a living. The flipside of austerity was supposed to be a fundamental rebalancing of the economy. Out would go high street spending sprees funded by asset-price bubbles; in would come what Osborne called the \"march of the makers\". This was a dazzling new world in which the cream of Britain's exporters would slug it out on global markets with the Germans, Americans, Swedes and Japanese.</p> <p>A 30% drop in the pound's exchange rate between 2007 and 2009 was supposed to make rebalancing easier, yet since the end of 2006 the value of UK exports has risen by 29%. The comparable figure for the US is 44%, while for China it is 87%. The latest official figures show the trade deficit in goods and services at its highest level since modern records began in 1997. The CBI said that manufacturers had cut their production plans for the coming months. The predicament facing the government can be summed up in three short sentences. Rebalancing is a fantasy. The economy is dead in the water. The budget deficit is increasing.</p> <p>Ministers will rightly be concerned about the deterioration in the public finances. July is one of the better months for the exchequer because it is one of four times a year when corporation tax receipts come rolling in, yet the deficit last month was more than \u00a33bn bigger than in the same month a year ago. Nor was the July figure a flash in the pan: borrowing is \u00a311.6bn higher in the first four months of the 2012-13 financial year than in 2011-12 once the one-off effect of transferring the Royal Mail pension fund to the public sector is stripped out.</p> <p>City analysts were warning that borrowing could be \u00a330-40bn higher than planned by the end of the year if the current trend were to continue. That would certainly raise a few eyebrows in the financial markets, and might even prompt a downgrade from the credit rating agencies, something the austerity programme is supposed to avoid.</p> <p>So what is to be done? One option, urged on Osborne by free-market think tanks and some Conservative backbenchers, is for much more aggressive deficit reduction. Taking the axe to public spending would, they say, allow the chancellor to cut taxes and that would prompt a private sector led recovery. Osborne does not appear to favour this approach. He has responded to weaker growth over the past 18 months by extending the deficit reduction plan from five to seven years, even though this means there will be no let up in austerity until at least halfway through the next parliament. One reason for the bigger-than-expected deficit in July was that government spending on infrastructure was up.</p> <p>A second option would be a package of tax cuts and spending increases designed to get the economy moving. Its supporters say this would mean a bigger deficit in the short term but a smaller deficit in the longer term because growth would be stronger.</p> <p>Osborne does not seem keen on this either, and not only because it would require him to do the mother and father of a U-turn from which his political reputation would never recover. His economic argument is that it would require a massive stimulus package to make much difference to the UK's growth rate, with a real risk of higher interest rates should the financial markets turn nasty.</p> <p>Within his self-imposed constraints, there are things Osborne could do, such as shifting the composition of public spending towards growth-rich investment projects.</p> <p>But, in reality, the chancellor's strategy can only work if cheap money from the Bank of England boosts the domestic economy, if the crisis in the eurozone is resolved quickly, and if the economy is not really as broken-backed as it appears to be.</p>",
  "<p>It's a Thursday night in Leeds and people are gathering outside the gay bar Queens Court for a march in support of&#xa0;Russian punk collective <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-trial-representatives-generation\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot</a>. Maria Alyokhina, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova are due to be sentenced the following day, the culmination of their trial on charges of \"hooliganism motivated by religious hatred\". (For performing their 40-second, Putin-denouncing \"punk prayer\" in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in February, they will each&#xa0;receive two years in jail.) In the meantime, this solidarity march is one of many taking place around the world.</p> <p>Behind a sandwich board, a man changes into a Wonder Woman suit; luminous balaclavas are surreptitiously pulled on as a police video surveillance van lingers in a side road. A woman whose face is covered by a green scarf&#xa0;cries: \"It's been so long since I've seen you masked up, darling!\" to a megaphone-brandishing woman with the words \"moralising slut\" written across her chest (a reference to Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/09/pussy-riot-madonna-called-moralising-slut\" title=\"\">who called Madonna a moralising \"slut\"</a> when she expressed support for Pussy Riot). \"I know: since the fucking 90s!\" laughs her friend, who turns out to be march organiser Mae Stephens.</p> <p>There are less-seasoned protestors here, too, among them musicians who have been inspired by the Pussy Riot case. When the march is over and has dispersed to the pub, I ask Wakefield-born protest singer <a href=\"http://www.louisedistras.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Louise Distras</a> why the punk collective resonate with her. \"Pussy Riot have inspired me by showing how we absolutely have to speak out against media portrayals of women as subordinates,\" she says, \"and how it's very important for female artists to represent other women.\" For Distras, the Pussy Riot influence echoes the \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jan/20/riot-girl-20-years-anniversary\" title=\"\">riot grrrl</a>\" scene of the early 1990s, an underground feminist punk movement that originated in the US. Riot grrrl's central message has been much debated, but can perhaps best be summed up as a mission to engender communities of supportive, creative women. Certainly, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/video/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-release-new-single-video\" title=\"\">Pussy Riot's abrasive, energetic sound</a> has much in common with that of the original riot grrrls <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfP5HNvsWAo\" title=\"\">Huggy Bear</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZxxhxjgnC0\" title=\"\">Bikini Kill</a> \u2013 though Bikini Kill frontwoman Kathleen Hanna recently cautioned against too literal a reboot of&#xa0;the term.

I asked Gaggle's founder, Deborah Coughlin, if she thought the trial had started something new. \"Riot grrrl still exists, but it's not the holy covenant of feminist music,\" she&#xa0;said. \"In fact if anything, I&#xa0;find it restrictive. It's not fundamentally important that Pussy Riot are musicians, but it is important that we learn from their ideas. They are a living illustration of what needs to change in their country, because we can see them suffering for it. I'm in awe. We've been discussing what we would risk for our beliefs.\"</p> <p>Leah Pritchard, singer and guitarist in the Bristol band <a href=\"http://emptypools.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Empty Pools</a>, has been donating money from sales of her solo material to Pussy Riot's legal fund via the website <a href=\"http://bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Bandcamp</a>. (Many other musicians have been doing the same.) Over the phone, Pritchard explains how Pussy Riot are redefining the idea of \"honest\" artistic expression, something we take for granted in the west. She quotes from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmWK7S5IIFw\" title=\"\">Alyokhina's closing statement</a> to the Moscow courtroom, which <a href=\"http://nplusonemag.com/pussy-riot-closing-statements\" title=\"\">in turn quoted from the Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky</a>: \"How unfortunate is the country where simple honesty is understood, in the best case, as heroism. And in the worst case as a mental disorder.\" It shows how little has changed in Russia since the early 1970s, when Bukovsky wrote this.</p> <p>In Australia, the underground music umbrella <a href=\"http://mysydneyriot.com/\" title=\"\">My Sydney Riot</a> (named before the Russians became famous) have put together a successful fund-raising compilation in aid of Pussy Riot. Founder Ray Lalota says he started My Sydney Riot out of frustration with an oligarchic music industry. \"<a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/\" title=\"\">Triple J</a> is an Australian, government-funded, national radio station which gives exposure to a few lucky bands,\" he tells me. \"They dictate how the industry at large works here. Festival bookers pick bands that are getting national airplay, meaning a lot of independent bands can't participate, creating a massive gap in the quality of music heard here. To not be allowed to express your art is heartbreaking \u2013 but in Pussy Riot's case, they are fighting for life itself. [Since the case began] I've seen new faces at shows and speaking out \u2013 we're all discovering the&#xa0;cultural similarities between Australians and Russians.\"</p> <p>As with any potent symbol of&#xa0;rebellion, there is a risk that the&#xa0;industry will co-opt Pussy Riot's message in order to make a buck. (There will be a lot of mass-produced posters of the jailed three lining student walls this autumn.) Neil Hanson, frontman of Leeds punk band <a href=\"http://kleineschweine.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\">Kleine Schweine</a>, tells me he is worried that their energy and image will be appropriated. \"There's always the fear that the knock-on effect could be loads of new bands who think that wearing masks and shouting 'Fuck the system' is a route to fame. I'm pretty sure major labels are already auditioning for&#xa0;their own Pussy Riot-style money-making band.\"</p> <p>Pussy Riot's global profile is, of course, an A&amp;R representative's dream. Bloomberg's Business Week website recently ran <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-08/what-would-a-music-label-pay-to-sign-pussy-riot\" title=\"\">a depressing article entitled \"What would a music label pay&#xa0;to sign Pussy Riot?\"</a> But it's unlikely Alyokhina, Samutsevich and Tolokonnikova will be signing on any dotted label lines come their eventual release. Will their&#xa0;trial kickstart a Russian punk movement? This seems unlikely. Music journalist Alex Hoban, who has reported from Russia and North Korea for Vice magazine, sees no&#xa0;signs of copycat behaviour. \"The Russian 'alternative' [scene] is marked, sadly, by its complete apathy towards anything other than looking cool. That sounds like a generalisation, but really it's quite shocking. The mainstream right are so vocal and overbearing \u2013 after the surge of enthusiasm during the Putin protests earlier in the year, things have quietened down.\" He is echoed by Brooklyn psychedelic band (and sisters) <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Prince+Rama\" title=\"\">Prince Rama</a>, who recently played Moscow; they tell me the conversation there was less about Pussy Riot, more about \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc_CMLGkBuE\" title=\"\">Ariel Pink</a> and&#xa0;McDonald's\".</p> <p>The music critic <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/everetttrue\" title=\"\">Everett True</a> sees in Pussy Riot an opportunity to challenge the male-centric music industry. Emailing from his home in Australia, he tells me: \"It's no coincidence that it's taken women to effect any major change within the poisoned citadel that is rock'n'roll in 2012. Men are such a devalued currency, as Putin and his humourless, protectionist cronies and apologists prove.\" He has a point: Pussy Riot have made feminism a vital part of the musical conversation in a year that saw the <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/reviews/gaggle/13327\" title=\"\">NME pan Gaggle's debut album</a> on the grounds that its members were likely to be open about their menstrual cycles and own books by Germaine Greer.</p> <p>Back in Leeds, Distras is unequivocal when I ask her whether the Pussy Riot effect could rid the music industry of the prejudice she regularly encounters, even among the supposedly inclusive political set. (At <a href=\"http://www.rebellionfestivals.com/\" title=\"\">Blackpool's Rebellion punk festival</a> this August, she says, male performers asked if burlesque dancing was part of her act.) \"This is a really good opportunity for people to blow sexism in music and beyond wide open,\" she says. \"A lot of people think Pussy Riot is a women's issue. Pussy Riot is the little girl who goes to school and gets told she's a worthless dyke because she's more interested in books than boys. Pussy Riot is the little boy who goes to school and gets told to man up when he expresses his emotions. I definitely don't think this is the end of everything. I think it's only the beginning.\"</p>",

  "<p>A bright-green kit car marked \"51 Nigeria\" stands under grey skies, yards from where the traffic endlessly groans out of the Blackwall tunnel. Young black scenesters, wearing smart-casual, pose in front of it, then mill over to the red carpet in front of the Greenwich Odeon, where <a href=\"http://www.voxafrica.co.uk\" title=\"\">VoxAfrica</a>, \"the first bilingual, pan-African channel\", is working the interview lineup. Tall women in traditional dress loll on benches nearby. This is the premiere of <a href=\"http://www.tangowithmefilm.com\" title=\"\">Tango with Me</a>, the fourth Nollywood film to get a mainstream release in the UK. PR rep Moses is getting antsy; he gets the cinema to make an announcement that the screening will be starting soon. No one pays any attention. Tonight, we're on African time, not Greenwich mean time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/sep/21/nollywood-nigerian-film-industry\" title=\"\">Nollywood</a>, Nigeria's film industry, is straining to up its game. Tango with Me \u2013 a melodrama about the aftermath of a wedding-night rape \u2013 is the latest to reach beyond VHS and DVD-led distribution, opting for the kind of overseas theatrical release needed to help legitimise Nigerian cinema and maybe even bring in non-African audiences. The budget is high by African standards (80-100m naira \u2013 about \u00a3326,000); the film stars industry queens <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevieve_Nnaji\" title=\"\">Genevieve Nnaji</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke_Silva\" title=\"\">Joke Silva</a> as well as rising newcomer <a href=\"http://nigeriafilms.com/news/16374/27/top-actor-joseph-benjamin-lauds-genevieve-nnaji.html\" title=\"\">Joseph Benjamin</a>; it has, in the eyes of director <a href=\"http://www.africafilmacademy.org/mahmood-ali-balogun\" title=\"\">Mahmood Ali-Balogun</a> , \"the right production values\" \u2013 the most salient problem for Nollywood, which likes to build them cheap and quick.</p> <p>Everyone is buzzing, especially <a href=\"http://www.djabass.com\" title=\"\">DJ Abass</a>, \"entertainment consultant\" for African events in London and compere for the screening: \"If you enjoy this movie, and you don't tell anyone, then I won't tell you what will happen to you. Just check your email inbox in a month's time.\"</p> <p>I'm not sure what I'm risking by sharing this, but I kind of enjoyed Tango with Me. I admired its forthrightness about rape in Nigeria \u2013 apparently discussing it openly is still a problem \u2013 but cinematically it still felt rudimentary: too many static camera setups, lots of long, on-the-nose dialogue scenes. Maybe I'm too used to western dramatic practices, with their emphasis on subtext and tension. One thing I really enjoyed, though, was watching it with a guffawing, interjecting, gesticulating African audience. Each time Benjamin's character, Uzo, impotent with the almond-eyed Nnaji, plays away from home, some wag shouts, \"Oh, Jos-eph!\" in mock indignation.</p> <p>At the Q&amp;A session afterwards, there's much pontification on whether Tango with Me is the leap into the mainstream that Nollywood has been waiting for. Everyone seems to agree the industry is in a transitional phase: \"The Nollywood of yesterday is different to the Nollywood of today, and it will be different to the Nollywood of tomorrow,\" as a producer in the audience puts it. There's certainly plenty of other evidence to suggest that it is moving on to a more established, professional footing: more film-makers shooting on film, not video; an increasing degree of international crossovers, like Jeta Amata's Hollywood star-laden Niger-delta thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/feb/01/jeta-amata-nollywood-s-gift-to-hollywood\" title=\"\">Black November</a>, Holly-Nolly co-production <a href=\"http://www.doctorbello.com\" title=\"\">Doctor Bello</a>, and the forthcoming Nigerian-UK adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie\" title=\"\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a>'s novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2006/aug/19/fiction.shopping2\" title=\"\">Half of a Yellow Sun</a>; the slick looking streaming-video library <a href=\"http://irokotv.com\" title=\"\">iROKOtv</a> \u2013 supported by US money \u2013 giving ready access to Nollywood's bottomless bargain-bin of titles.</p> <p>At what point does a film industry become truly mainstream? If Tango with Me is the litmus test, I'd say Nollywood isn't there yet, aesthetically at least. It's not fully exploiting the virtues of the medium yet. The declarative dialogue, some of the riper acting from the bit-parters \u2013 they feel as though they're hand-me-downs from older art forms, like oral storytelling, that Nollywood has budded out of. Sometimes, I think you can still glean that kind of folk heritage in some 1940s and 50s Hollywood films, like when comedies occasionally forgot the ruthless plot focus of commercial cinema, and let their characters revert back to gratuitous knockabout japes that feel as though they belong on the stage. That slackened, carefree vibe certainly still appears in many Bollywood films, which are on a technically higher plane than current Nollywood.</p> <p>Those are the values of the commercial global mainstream, though. By another reckoning, Nollywood is already mainstream: the dominant industry of sub-Saharan Africa by virtue of pricing (dirt-cheap) and distribution (any means necessary, including piracy) arrangements in tune with Africa, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jul/10/tanzania-vjs-hollywood-africa\" title=\"\">where Hollywood has little or no official presence</a>. And with the hardwood moral messages and Christian values propagated by many Nigerian films, they have a consolidated sense of their audience's identity \u2013 the very meaning of mainstream. Tango with Me is no exception, and at the Q&amp;A, someone eagerly inquires what kind of Christian director Ali-Balogun happens to be. \"Born again,\" he says, proudly.</p> <p>But there's more than one mainstream in the world, and his eye is on the overlaps between them. \"What we are going through, Hollywood went through and Bollywood went through,\" is how he explains the process. Nollywood, if Ali-Balogun is correct, is about to born again, too.</p> <p>\u2022 Tango with Me is out on Friday. Next week's After Hollywood will focus on Dan Mintz, gatekeeper to the Chinese film industry for Hollywood. Meanwhile, what global box-office stories would you like to see covered in the column?

  "<p>Doctors, dietitians and divines have long sought to identify the secret of a long life.

  "<p>Profits at Best Buy, the US's biggest consumer electronics retailer, plummeted 91% in the second quarter, an announcement that came a day after the company named a new chief executive.</p> <p>The troubled retail chain saw sales drop both in the US and internationally, but the biggest hit came from a $91m restructuring charge, primarily related to its plans to shut down a swathe of its \"big-box\" giant retail stores. Best Buy reported a profit of $12m for the quarter ended August 4 versus $128m a year earlier.</p> <p>The company's shares hit a nine year low in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen Monday when the firm announced takeover talks with founder Richard Schulze had collapsed and that Hubert Joly, who specialises in corporate turnarounds, would take over as CEO.</p> <p>The firm has been without a full-time CEO since April when former boss Brian Dunn, 51, left Best Buy with a $6.6m payoff after what the company described as \"close personal relationship\" with a 29-year-old female employee that \"negatively impacted the work environment\".</p> <p>Joly is the former head of Carlson, a hospitality company that owns TGI Fridays among other brands.

Joly, who is French, is expected to start in September when his visa is secured. \"We believe that this is a herculean task even for an accomplished retail executive and believe that Mr Joly's complete lack of retail experience will be an impediment to his success,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note.</p> <p>Joly faces a corporate as well as a financial challenge at the company. Schulze has offered to take the company private for $9bn. Schulze, who grew the chain from a single store and was its chief executive for 36 years, owns 20% of Best Buy. The talks stalled ahead of the appointment of Joly and the earnings announcement. Schultze said he was \"disappointed and surprised by the Best Buy Board's abrupt termination of our discussions.\"</p> <p>Best Buy has seen off real world rivals including Circuit City, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, to emerge as the last large electronic retail chain in the US. But it too is struggling with increased competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Along with its real-world rivals Best Buy suffers from what retail analysts call \"show-rooming\" when potential customers try products in store then go home to purchase them cheaper online.</p> <p>In March Best Buy announced plans to shut 50 stores as part of an $800m cost saving drive. In its latest results Best Buy said it had reduced its US big box square footage by 4% year-over-year and that domestic revenue per square foot were up 1% year-over-year. </p> <p>Sales from stores, call centers and websites operating for at least 14 months \u2013 known as same-store sales \u2013 fell 3.2% in the latest period. Best Buy's US same-store sales fell 1.6%, while internationally sales dropped 8.2% with the company blaming lower sales in China, Canada and \"increased competitive conditions in Europe\". Sales of mobile devices including eReaders and smartphones soared but were offset by falling sales for notebooks, TVs, cameras and other items.</p> <p>The company declined to give any guidance on future sales but on a conference call with analysts executives said they were more confident about the second half of their financial year, traditionally the largest sales period for retailers.</p> <p>Best Buy made a $1.34bn (then \u00a31bn) investment in Carphone Warehouse in the UK in 2008 and had planned to open branches across Britain. The venture failed and it shut its larger Best Buy stores in the UK. The two companies retain a joint venture called Best Buy Europe.</p> <p>Same-store sales at Best Buy have declined for two of the last three years. The company posted a net loss of $1.23bn on revenue of $50.7bn for the year that ended in March, its first annual loss since 1991.</p>",

  "<p>There are few more certain ways of looking a chump than opining on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/17/cabinet-reshuffle-cameron-2005-intake\" title=\"\">future cabinet reshuffles</a>. Even when a prime minister knows weeks in advance exactly what he wants to do, a sudden resignation or unforeseen clash can destroy any well-planned jigsaw puzzle. No one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/jun/28/labour.uk\" title=\"\">predicted that Margaret Beckett would be made foreign secretary in 2006</a>; no one could have done, because even Tony Blair hadn't expected to be making the appointment at the start of the day.</p> <p>So take with a pinch of salt the supposed <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9481240/Tory-class-of-2005-will-be-promoted-in-Government-reshuffle-next-month.html\" title=\"\">inside information</a> currently being bandied about. In truth, the cabinet that emerges next month \u2013 and it's still only speculation that there will actually be a reshuffle \u2013 may be different from the one even David Cameron has in mind.</p> <p>That said, one fixed point is that George Osborne will remain as chancellor. It is not merely that he and the prime minister are joined at the hip; ditching the chancellor, even if Cameron had any inclination to do so (which he doesn't), would destroy the government's economic credibility at a stroke.</p> <p>There is an assumption that William Hague, too, will remain as foreign secretary, but it's far from inconceivable that he will be asked to plug a gaping hole in the current team: the party chairmanship. Baroness Warsi has strengths \u2013 she is a walking rebuttal to the idea of the Conservative party as narrow-minded \u2013 but never having been elected, she's simply not up to the specific requirements of the job. <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/michael-fallon/25169\" title=\"\">Michael Fallon</a> is favourite \u2013 he is indefatigable whenever someone is needed to dig the government out of a media hole \u2013 but the <a href=\"http:// www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/20/sell-social-housing-fund-homes\" title=\"\">housing minister, Grant Shapps</a>, is also in the running.</p> <p>The three main reformers, Andrew Lansley at health, Iain Duncan Smith at work and pensions and Michael Gove at education, are expected to stay put. Cameron loathes the idea of expertise acquired doing a job being squandered and, having survived thus far, Lansley will probably remain in post. IDS's reforms are still incomplete and his own desire to stay probably matches the PM's propensity to let ministers get on with things.</p> <p>Gove is more tricky. The undoubted star of the government \u2013 he has faced down his enemies within the education establishment and his own department \u2013 there are many MPs pressing his case for promotion. But that misunderstands Gove. The education secretary sees his current job as something close to the pinnacle of politics \u2013 he is being given the chance to effect truly radical change in education and transform millions of lives. What could be a promotion from that? My bet is he will stay.</p> <p>Kenneth Clarke's time, however, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/20/kenneth-clarke-cabinet-post-reshuffle\" title=\"\">run out</a>. It was an understandable move to call on his experience when the government took office. But he is not merely out of tune with his party; his soft approach is completely out of step with the country. Whoever replaces him \u2013 perhaps Nick Herbert, who shadowed the job in opposition \u2013 it would be wrong to paint his replacement as indicating some shift to the right. It's more a case of removing an anachronism.</p> <p>Others who will probably disappear are the <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/08/18/don-t-replace-welsh-secretary-cheryl-gillan-with-another-england-based-mp-lib-dems-warn-91466-31646506/\" title=\"\">anonymous Welsh secretary, Cheryl Gillan</a>, the leader of the house, Sir George Young, who like Clarke was included primarily for his experience, the environment secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/15/caroline-spelman-interview-green-growing-rio20\" title=\"\">Caroline Spelman</a>, who has achieved next to nothing in nearly two and half years, and the chief whip, Patrick McLoughlin, who has failed in the basic task of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jun/20/david-cameon-defeat-lords-reform\" title=\"\">preventing rebellions</a>.</p> <p>Since there are so few obvious women poised for promotion, expect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/26/baroness-warsi-cleared-expenses\" title=\"\">Warsi</a> to be kept on in some capacity. And to increase their number, <a href=\"http://www.dwp.gov.uk/about-dwp/ministers/#mm\" title=\"\">Maria Miller, the minister for the disabled</a>, may be brought in. And it would be an odd reshuffle that did not promote <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/profiles/corporate/gregclark\" title=\"\">Greg Clark, the minister for cities</a>, who wins plaudits across the Commons.</p> <p>Ideologically, it's unlikely that the reshuffle will signal any particular shift, although <a href=\"http://www.owenpaterson.org/text.aspx?id=1\" title=\"\">Owen Patterson, the Northern Ireland secretary</a>, may well be given a more frontline job. But that, too, will say more about his talents than his position as one of the leaders of the right.</p> <p>Cameron's predisposition is to leave well alone, so do not expect too many fireworks. Then again: what do I know?</p>",
  "<p>Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">has died aged 57</a>. A commanding and compelling figure, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/meles-zenawi-profile-ethiopia-prime-minister\" title=\"\">he tended to polarise opinion</a>. Former US president Bill Clinton cast him as a \"renaissance leader\", but others regarded him as despotic and dictatorial. However he was perceived, though, Meles was hard to ignore. Here are some key dates and political events in his life:</p> <h2>May 1955</h2> <p>Born Legesse Zenawi in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. He would later change his name to Meles, in tribute to an activist killed by Ethiopia's communist government.</p> <h2>1974</h2> <p>Dropped out of medical school and travelled back to the Tigray bush to take part in a nationalist revolt against the dictatorship of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam. A year later, he helped found the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF).</p> <h2>1989</h2> <p>Became leader of the TPLF, broadening its ethnic Tigrayan power base by setting up the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), a coalition incorporating other ethnic groups.</p> <h2>May 1991</h2> <p>After Mengistu had fled Ethiopia en route to Zimbabwe, Meles and his EPRDF rebels arrived in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Two months later, an interim government was formed with Meles as transitional president.</p> <h2>August 1995</h2> <p>After poorly contested elections, the EPRDF swept to power; the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was proclaimed, and Meles became Ethiopia's first prime minister.</p> <h2>1998-2000</h2> <p>Border tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which ceded from Ethiopia in 1993, resulted in a war that claimed tens of thousands of lives before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/25/ethiopia?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Ethiopia declared victory in May 2000</a>. Seven months later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/dec/13/ethiopia\" title=\"\">the two countries signed a peace treaty</a>.</p> <h2>May 2005</h2> <p>Ethiopians voted in a poll billed as the country's first democratic election. The opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) gained huge support in cities and towns, but the election culminated in violence in Addis Ababa when the CUD claimed the EPRDF fixed the outcome. A total of 193 protesters and seven policemen were killed, and lingering post-election violence damaged Ethiopia's reputation as an emerging African democracy, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/dec/04/ethiopia\" title=\"\">raising the possibility of foreign aid being withdrawn</a>. Meles <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/30/hearafrica05.eu?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">condemned an EU report criticising the conduct of the election</a> as a \"pack of lies\".</p> <h2>December 2006</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/21/mainsection.international11\" title=\"\">Ethiopia sent troops into Somalia</a> to drive Islamists from power. Analysts claimed Meles's government was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/13/alqaida.usa?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">backed by the US</a>. The move underlined the close ties Meles had fostered with the west since ousting Mengistu's regime. Ethiopian troops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/26/ethiopia-ends-somalia-occupation\" title=\"\">withdrew from Somalia in January 2009</a>.</p> <h2>December 2009</h2> <p>Meles represented Africa at the Copenhagen climate talks, cementing his position as one of the continent's leading statesmen despite opposition claims of autocratic tendencies. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/28/africa-climate-change\" title=\"\">a comment piece for the Guardian</a>, Meles said Africa would be hardest hit by the effects of climate change. He subsequently appealed to the conference for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/16/meles-zenawi-copenhagen-climate-funding\" title=\"\">a finance deal whereby rich countries would fund schemes to help poor states adapt to climate change</a> and embrace clean technology.</p> <h2>May 2010</h2> <p>The EPRDF <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/26/ethiopia-election-result-meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">won a landslide victory in the national election</a>, claiming 499 out of 547 seats. The result meant a fourth term as prime minister for Meles, but human rights groups questioned the poll's validity, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/25/ethiopia-election-irregularities-claim?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">citing reported irregularities</a>. EU and US observers said the vote <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13349400\" title=\"\">failed to meet international standards</a>, while opposition leaders demanded the election be held again.</p> <h2>April 2011</h2> <p>Ethiopia's foreign ministry used a press release to <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/Ethiopia-to-step-up-support-to,38593\" title=\"\">voice support for Eritrean rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Isaias Afewerki</a>. Just over a year later, fears of renewed conflict between the two countries resurfaced when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/16/ethiopian-raid-eritrea-conflict\" title=\"\">Addis Ababa announced it had sent troops into its sworn enemy's territory</a> for the first time in more than a decade. The announcement also marked the first time Ethiopia had admitted to such attacks since the conclusion of the border war.</p> <h2>June 2012</h2> <p>Ethiopia announced plans to keep its troops in Somalia until the Horn of Africa nation ratifies a constitution and its military is able to fend off militant threats. Ethiopian troops had crossed into Somalia in November 2011.</p> <h2>July 2012</h2> <p>Meles's failure to attend the African Union summit in Addis Ababa intensified <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">speculation about his health; the rumours subsequently gathered increasing momentum</a>.</p> <h2>20 August 2012</h2> <p>Ethiopian state television reported <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">the death of Meles</a> following a sudden infection. \"The premier [had] been receiving medical treatment abroad for the past two months and his health was improving, but due to a sudden infection which occurred [on Sunday], he went back to hospital for emergency treatment, and even if a lot of medical attention was given by his doctors, he died yesterday [Monday] at around 23:40,\" said the statement. It was announced that deputy prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn would become acting prime minister.</p> <h2>Legacy</h2> <p>Meles saw his legacy as continuous with the accomplishments of the EPRDF. \"I cannot separate my achievements from what can be considered as the achievements of the ruling party,\" he once said. \"Whatever achievement there might have been, it does not exist independent of that party.\" Under his rule, Ethiopia was widely praised for its economic progress. Education improved and women gained greater rights. But Meles's authoritarianism attracted the frequent censure of human rights groups, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-renaissance-meles-zenawi\" title=\"\">such concerns will inevitably temper assessments of his bequest to Ethiopia</a>.</p>",
  "<p>India's highest court is due to hear a case that could decide whether cut-price generic drugs for cancer and other serious conditions will continue to be available in much of the developing world.</p> <p>The long-running case, which resumes in Delhi on Wednesday, has been brought by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It wants an Indian patent for its leukaemia drug imatinib mesylate, which has been patented as Glivec in nearly 40 countries including China, Russia, Mexico, Taiwan, Germany and the UK, and Gleevec in the US.</p> <p>Novartis says the legal move is \"about protecting intellectual property to advance the practice of medicine, not about changing access to medicines\", according to Ranjit Shahani, the vice-chairman and managing director of Novartis India. But campaigners argue that a victory for Novartis could result in the deaths of thousands of people who will no longer be able to afford the drugs they need.</p> <p>\"It would quite simply be a death sentence for us,\" said Vikas Ahuja, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1993 and is now the president of the Delhi Network of Positive People. \"I am quite sure that if Novartis wins, other multinationals will follow suit and other drugs will become prohibitively expensive.\"</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) believes the ramifications of a Novartis win would be felt beyond India's borders. \"If Novartis won the case, patents would be granted in India as broadly as they are in wealthy countries and on new formulations of known medicines already in use,\" <a href=\"http://www.msfaccess.org/content/qa-patents-india-and-novartis-case\" title=\"\">MSF says in a Q&amp;A on its website</a>.</p> <p>\"India would no longer be able to supply much of the developing world with quality affordable medicines \u2026 More and more treatments will remain priced out of reach for the duration of the patent term \u2013 20 years or more \u2013 including those that are merely new forms of existing medicine and didn't deserve a patent in the first place.\"</p> <p>Indian generic medicines are among <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/26/pharmaceutical-companies-health-worlds-poor-risk\" title=\"\">the cheapest in the world</a>, largely because India did not issue patents on drugs until 2005 after coming under pressure from the World Trade Organisation. Its size also means it has the production capacity to manufacture reliable and safe copies of branded medicines.</p> <p>As a result, India now makes one-fifth of the world's generics, such as antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV and Aids. About half are sent abroad, mostly to other developing countries.</p> <p>Even if Novartis wins, generic versions of Glivec will still be available in India because it came on the market before 2005 and is protected under a so-called \"grandfather clause\" in Indian patent law, said Shahani.</p> <p>This week's supreme court case is the final chapter in a legal spat that has rumbled on since 2006, when Novartis first tried and failed to patent Glivec. At that time, the drug was sold at \u00a31,650 per patient per month in countries where Novartis had obtained a patent. In India, generic versions of Glivec were available for less than \u00a3127 per patient per month in 2006.</p> <p>The patent office in Chennai rejected the claim on the grounds that the drug was not sufficiently new, but a slightly modified update of an older medicine. When India finally introduced a patent law seven years ago, it included a clause which decreed that \"patentability\" shall be granted only if pharmaceutical companies can prove \"enhanced efficacy\".</p> <p>This legal provision aims to stop firms from seeking patents or extensions based on minor changes to existing treatments \u2013 a practice known as \"evergreening\" that is common in Europe and the US. The clause has allowed India to reject patents for a range of older drugs for cancer, Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other illnesses that are made by India's generics industry.</p> <p>Given India's own poverty \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3013870.ece\" title=\"\">30% of the population earn less than 32p a day</a> \u2013 many argue the limits still make sense domestically, particularly as Indian patients bear at least 80% of their own medical costs. Branded and patented drugs are often 10 to 40 times more expensive than generics.</p> <p>Shahani said Novartis had brought the case to clarify India's investment environment. \"Knowing we can rely on patents in India benefits government, industry and patients because research-based organisations will know if investing in the development of better medicines for India is a viable long-term option,\" he said in an email on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"As one of the largest manufacturers of generic medicines in the world, Novartis understands the role played by legitimate generics and recognises that access to medicines is a far more complicated issue involving lack of diagnosis, infrastructure and distribution and goes beyond just making generic drugs available,\" Shahani argued.</p> <p>\"Without patents there will be no new drugs and without new drugs there will be no new generics. Governments, NGOs and companies need to work together to find innovative solutions to these issues.\"</p> <p>But those whose lives depend on affordable drugs are not reassured. \"Why do pharmaceutical companies spend so much on research that they can only make drugs rich people can afford?\" said Ahuja, whose organisation is party to the supreme court case, along with the Indian government and the Cancer Patients Aid Association.</p> <p>\"If they are only going to serve a certain class of people, they should say so in their advertising, rather than pretending to be so altruistic.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>What led you to founding </strong><a href=\"http://www.heartnsoul.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Heart n Soul</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>Music has always been something incredibly important to me. It has a power to subtly, sometimes profoundly, change people. I was working as a professional musician, but feeling fairly disillusioned about the industry \u2013 I was in a band that was quite idealistic (we really wanted to change the world and this was the early 1980s so there was a lot that needed changing), but we'd gone from doing gigs and festivals to a point where we seemed to be making music simply for A&amp;R people.</p> <p>So I grabbed the opportunity of making music with different people via the <a href=\"http://www.shapearts.org.uk/\" title=\"\">disability arts organisation Shape</a>. Things were beginning to happen at the time but there wasn't any conception of learning disability artists. I was given the opportunity to do a once a week music session at Lewisham Academy of Music with a group of people with learning disabilities.</p> <p><strong>How did you find that initial experience?</strong></p> <p>I had no preconceptions or any particular expertise around who I was going to be dealing with so I came with an open mind. I encountered a group of people who had a tremendous energy and enthusiasm in how they expressed themselves, but not a huge amount of technique \u2013 just yet.</p> <p>They were not used to listening to each other so over a period of months we found ways to tune in to one another. After six months, one of the singers, Pino (who used to wear this huge Elvis Presley badge) broke into a chorus that was nothing I'd ever heard before. It was a real moment in the room: a realisation that they could create their own original material. After that, a floodgate opened \u2013 we never did a cover version again.</p> <p><strong>What made you want to focus on work in this area?</strong></p> <p>What I began to understand about the learning disabled aesthetic is that it cuts straight through to the main issue. And when it comes to writing music, they were creating instantly catchy tunes. It was what we were trying to do to appease those A&amp;R men, and here I was sitting in a workshop in Deptford on a Thursday afternoon with a group of learning disabled people who did it without having to think about it.</p> <p>I was also growing in my understanding and awareness of what it meant to live your life in a day centre \u2013 how hidden these people were. There was no ambition or aspiration. No sense of a career movement, or any movement outside the day centre or their own borough.</p> <p><strong>How did Heart n Soul get going as an organisation?</strong></p> <p>Heart n Soul got in there at the end of the golden era of arts funding when people were still investing in new companies and giving them space for performance, development and administration. We could only go one way, which was up. Sadly, many others went down. There were such amazing resources: the National Disabliity Forum, the London Disability Forum, events in Covent Garden and lots of festivals taking place. People became aware of what we were doing and by the early 1990s, we were touring here and abroad.</p> <p><strong>How have you taken Heart n Soul's reputation from local to international?</strong></p> <p>My role has always been about bringing in the right people who all hold quality as their number one priority, so that we never had to meet the low expectations that did exist at that time around what we could or couldn't do. It's also about creating the right environment where people feel safe and creative and free, and are really able to express themselves.</p> <p>It's not so much lobbying as taking opportunities, getting out and about and being seen. It was hugely complex at the beginning, when we were a tiny little operation. We'd be picking people up from their house, carting around equipment and driving everyone home at the end in the same van. But it was, and is, something that is very authentic and very real; that has always spoken to people who experienced our work. It's not called Heart n Soul for nothing.</p> <p><strong>Why do you shy away from the term 'art therapy'?</strong></p> <p>If you present yourself as a therapist, that's what you'll always be. There are clearly beneficial and therapeutic aspects to our work, but that's not why we do it. It's always about the art. One of the reasons we're able to attract such great collaborations is that we create an environment where anything is possible. Our singers aren't stuck in genres. They're not over analytical \u2013 they're just doing it. There is something about that purity that seems the essence of creativity.</p> <p><strong>How did your Paralympic Unlimited commission, </strong><a href=\"http://deanrodneysingers.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>the Dean Rodney Singers</strong></a><strong>, come about?</strong></p> <p>We've known Dean since he was 14. He's a young man with autism and a fantastic performer \u2013 he has an amazing imagination and such a different perspective on life. He had a dream of this band of 72 people called the Dean Rodney Singers. When it became clear that <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/about-us/cultural-olympiad/unlimited/\" title=\"\">the Unlimited programme</a> was interested in a disabled artist-led vision and in organisations moving beyond what they could normally do, we thought: well, this is kind of a crazy idea but worth putting forward.</p> <p>The discussions started about a year and half ago, with Dean, digital consultancy <a href=\"http://www.unthinkableconsulting.com/\" title=\"\">Unthinkable</a>, <a href=\"http://soundandmusic.org/\" title=\"\">Sound and Music</a>, the South Bank Centre and the British Council. The way Dean sees things is very specific \u2013 precise numbers and amounts of stuff: 72 singers, seven countries, seven dimensions. He knew what each person in the band would be doing and was very clear about there being a mix of disabled and non-disabled people. In that sense, it pushed our boundaries.</p> <p>We worked with an incredible range of people and impairments: a deaf dancer, a dancer in a wheelchair, Down Syndrome performers, a visually impaired bass player and soprano singer. Everyone involved has embraced the concept, uploading 200 videos onto YouTube and Vimeo and 600 mixes on Soundcloud.</p> <p><strong>Is digital a challenge or an opportunity for Heart n Soul?</strong></p> <p>I heard the chief executive of the British Council saying at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/aug/14/olympics-international-culture-summit-edinburgh?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Edinburgh International Culture Summit</a> that some arts organisations are a bit scared of digital. We've always embraced it, especially once we saw the iPad and the apps arriving on a weekly basis and how accessible they are for Dean and for hearing and visually impaired people. There's the possibility of being so immediate and sharing the process of the work you're creating \u2013 we've been uploading every step of the way and people have been commenting. There's more work to be done but it feels like a huge playground of possibilities.</p> <p><strong>You were awarded the MBE in 2010 \u2013 was that a career highlight?</strong></p> <p>I have to say this project is. When we first heard we had the funding, there was a feeling of complete terror. But this is what we do: fearlessly entering the unknown, pushing the definitions of ordinary, trying new things, taking risks. With this we're taking the biggest risk we've ever taken. The final 23 mixes of Dean's songs are being signed off tomorrow. It's going to be incredible.</p> <p><strong>We've spoken mostly of artists \u2013 what about audiences?</strong></p> <p>We put a lot of attention into the audience experience \u2013 you only have to look at <a href=\"http://ticketing.southbankcentre.co.uk/find/dance-performance/tickets/the-beautiful-octopus-club-66075\" title=\"\">the Beautiful Octopus Club</a>. Half our focus goes on what it's going to feel like for participants; that's part of the key to its success. The club now has 50 events around the country. Every time we do it gets bigger, but the South Bank event on 7 September is going to be biggest ever celebration of learning disabilities in the world \u2013 we'll be on three different floors of the Royal Festival Hall, including the Clore Ballroom, and we're expecting 2,500 people.</p> <p>What's even more fantastic is that you get people just passing by on a Friday morning who see everyone having an amazing time. It's the kind of beautiful way that preconceptions get changed. You can't force these things. This hasn't come from some business plan somewhere. It's real people doing real work.</p> <p><em>Mark Williams is artistic director of </em><a href=\"http://www.heartnsoul.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Heart n Soul</em></a><em> \u2013 follow them on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeartnSoulArt\" title=\"\"><em>@HeartnSoulArt</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Britain's manufacturers have scaled back plans to boost output after their order books were hit by weak domestic demand and a tougher climate for exports, according to the latest snapshot of manufacturing from the CBI.</p> <p>In its monthly industrial trends survey, the employers' organisation found 15% of firms questioned reported order books above normal, but 36% said order levels were below normal. The balance of -21 was the worst since last December.</p> <p>Export orders also weakened, with manufacturers reporting a balance of -17. While still above the long-run average of -21, this is the lowest figure reported since January.</p> <p>Output is expected to be flat over the next three months, with as many firms reporting plans to cut production as those with plans to expand. This represented a decline from the two previous surveys, in which manufacturers expected output to increase.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/14/inflation-surprise-rise-july\" title=\"\">With inflation on a downward trend despite last month's rise</a>, the price of goods leaving the factory gate is also expected to be flat for the third consecutive month, with a balance of +1.</p> <p>Stock levels are below average, with a balance of +9 showing they are at least adequate to meet demand, the lowest figure since last June.</p> <p>Anna Leach, the CBI's head of economic analysis, said: \"Overall demand for manufactured goods has eased back this month, led by a weakening in the consumer goods sector following a strong July figure. This sector also contributed to the weakening in output expectations for the next three months, alongside investment goods.</p> <p>\"The economic environment for UK manufacturers remains challenging, with domestic demand relatively muted and the ongoing eurozone crisis now seeming to drag on broader global economic momentum.\"</p>",
  "<p>In their matching blue tops, the group walking along Whitstable seafront certainly stands out. And it is meant to. The picturesque Kent seaside resort is hardly a hotbed of social problems, but as the latest town to launch a branch of \"<a href=\"http://www.streetpastors.co.uk/CurrentLocations/South/Whitstable/tabid/938/Default.aspx\" title=\"\">street pastors</a>\" it is part of a growing phenomenon.</p> <p>The pastors are church volunteers patrolling the beach and offering assistance to teenagers and young people who may have drunk too much. \"We set out to listen, help and care for members of our local community with a focus on the safety of young people on the beaches,\" explains Chris Izzard, founding member and pastor of Tankerton Evangelical Church.</p> <p>\"The young people gather on the beach to party and drink alcohol, which can result in them becoming vulnerable. We carry water, flip-flops and blankets to give out.\"</p> <p>The group of 20 volunteers, which formed earlier this year after church leaders consulted with local police and the council about how the scheme would work, began patrolling last month after training including basic counselling skills, and sea safety from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.</p> <p>The volunteers include a veterinary nurse, a tax inspector, a classroom assistant and a number of retired people as well as some church ministers. So far, Izzard says, there has been nothing in the way of criticism of the project and no indication that anyone objects to churches taking on such a&#xa0;role.</p> <p>\"We have been able to rescue a young girl down from London who missed the last train home and lost contact with her friends. We were able to escort her around the town until we found her friends,\" he says.</p> <p>Since the scheme launched in inner-city London in 2003 (as a response by local churches to urban violence and gang culture), the street pastors project has had to deal with concerns about it being a vehicle for proselytising. However, according to Eustace Constance, operations director of the Ascension Trust, the charity that oversees and runs 10,000 street pastors across the UK, the scheme is not evangelical.</p> <p>\"Sometimes rightly, churches have been criticised for not being more active within their communities. This is about playing our part. Street pastors started out urban, but now we are in villages and towns all over the country.\"</p> <p>Constance says there is evidence that levels of crime go down where street pastors are active, adding that the scheme is endorsed by community workers as well as&#xa0;police.</p> <p>Simon Cole, chief constable of Leicestershire and Association of Chief Police Officers lead on local policing for and partnerships, says volunteers have widespread support. \"Faith-based citizen patrols, such as street pastors, have made a significant difference by helping people and keeping them safe. I have spent time with the local street pastors in my own force and they do a magnificent job.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.social-policy.org.uk/lincoln2011/Green%20and%20Johns%20P7.pdf\" title=\"\">study</a> by the University of Plymouth, which set out to see if concerns about street pastors were founded, concluded that, on the contrary, reactions were \"overwhelmingly positive\" and that while it was unclear what, if any, kind of impact they had on crime, there was no evidence that pastors were evangelising.</p> <p>Back in Whitstable, Izzard says the aim is simple: \"We are there to help and support anyone in need.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://streetpastors.co.uk\" title=\"\">streetpastors.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>If working for a values-led organisation is at the heart of your job search, your strategy is sound \u2013 if only for the increased likelihood of job satisfaction. A <a href=\"http://netimpact.org/docs/publications-docs/NetImpact_WhatWorkersWant2012.pdf\" title=\"\">report by Net Impact</a>, what workers want in 2012, reveals that employees who make a direct positive social and environmental impact through their roles have twice the level of job satisfaction.</p> <p><a href=\"http://onpurpose.uk.com/\" title=\"\">On Purpose</a>, which runs a one-year programme of paid placements and coaching to develop social enterprise leaders, is <a href=\"http://onpurpose.uk.com/become-an-on-purpose-associate/apply-today-2\" title=\"\">doubling its intake of associates</a>. Programme manager Kate Richardson attributes this to an increasing disillusionment among young professionals working tirelessly for anonymous shareholder return.</p> <p>In fact, a company led by values can be better placed to survive tough times. \"Being values-led can give businesses a commercial edge that no branding agency could hope to achieve,\" says <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/business-better-values-core-resilience\" title=\"\">Karen Mattison, founder of Timewise</a>. The values underpinning her business make it more resilient, help attract people who share the same vision, and provide identity and purpose. \"We never wobble about our business direction or the decisions we take, because our vision is so focused.\"</p> <p>Leaders in environmental, social and governance policies outperform competitors in stock performance by an average of 25%, with poorly-performing firms far more likely to have nobody in charge of sustainability issues, reports <a href=\"http://www.sustainableindustries.com/articles/2012/06/beyond-employee-engagement-employee-integration\" title=\"\">Sustainable Industries</a>.</p> <p>But how can you identify an organisation that puts sustainable values at its core, rather than adding them for a look-good factor?</p> <h2>Mission statements</h2> <p>Look for how success is measured in different ways to a traditional balance sheet. Does an organisation's mission include values important to both the business and the wider community and environment? A good example of this is <a href=\"http://www.benjerry.com/activism/mission-statement\" title=\"\">Ben &amp; Jerry's</a>.</p> <p>Does the company set out a clear business case for sustainability, showing how strategically embedding sustainable values has a <a href=\"http://www.unileverusa.com/Images/UnileverSustainableLivingPlan_tcm23-284876.pdf\" title=\"\">bottom line impact</a> on growth and profits? Keep your mind open. On Purpose chooses a wide variety of organisations to place their associates, from charities and social enterprises to multinational companies.</p> <p>Search commitments and objectives to reduce waste, develop sustainable sourcing or production methods, or <a href=\"http://www.benandjerrysfoundation.org/home.html\" title=\"\">support local communities through grants or foundations</a>.</p> <h2>Goals and disclosure</h2> <p>Are there specific targets for energy, resources, or environmental impact? Are there <a href=\"http://www.unileverusa.com/Images/uslp-Unilever_Sustainable_Living_Plan_Progress_Report_2011_tcm23-284779.pdf\" title=\"\">progress reports</a> and are efforts <a href=\"http://www.unileverusa.com/sustainable-living/ourapproach/independentassurance/\" title=\"\">audited externally</a>?</p> <p>Look for transparency in financial reporting \u2013 or, like Puma, the adoption of an<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/puma-value-environmental-impact-biodiversity?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> environmental profit and loss account</a>.</p> <p>Ilaria Ida, European social missions manager at Ben &amp; Jerry's suggests checking out company claims, and how the company portrays itself. A \"work in progress\" story, narrated in humble tones, is far more believable than overstating sustainability credentials.</p> <h2>Communication style</h2> <p>Look at the ways the company communicates through its website, advertising and use of social media. How a company engages with you and the wider community, is also revealing. Are they transparent: responding promptly to questions and requests, or through being active within their sector, sharing their knowledge, debating strategy and communicating their values? Read their publications and articles, and what's been written about them to gain deeper insights.</p> <p>As a candidate, can you get information or advice, attend open days or gain work experience? Is the company respectful of your time and interest, informing you if your application is unsuccessful?</p> <h2>Management style</h2> <p>Ian Cheshire, CEO of Kingfisher says that while the CEO needs to push for sustainability, team engagement is as important. \"No CEO runs a company on their own. It takes thousands and the same is true of sustainability.\"</p> <p>Assess how you'll be able to make a contribution, and whether initiatives and bottom-up thinking are valued. At interview, ask how the company sets sustainability goals and measures progress, and whether it's linked to compensation.</p> <p>What does the company offer in benefits and opportunities for promotion and growth, or investment through training and development? Examine staff turnover rates. (Useful information on hiring patterns and career paths is included in LinkedIn company profiles.)</p> <h2>Commitment beyond the value chain</h2> <p>Ida says that companies should go beyond their value chain for \"the amazing impact when they team up with civil society and NGOs\". The <a href=\"http://www.happycows.eu\" title=\"\">Happy Cows campaign</a>, a collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.ciwf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Compassion in World Farming</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.wspa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">World Society for the Protection of Animals</a> is an example.</p> <p>Companies can also go beyond minimum standards through managing indirect impacts (for example on how the end user creates wider impacts, through product disposal). Some companies try to limit these impacts through better product design, or by changing consumer behaviour.</p> <h2>External certification</h2> <p>Does the company collaborate with others, or create standards where none previously existed? Look for ways the organisation works with third parties to ensure standards are met, upheld and certified.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>It started, presumably, as a run-of-the-mill internal decision. A young girl was photographing her school lunches and posting the images on a blog and her local authority instructed the school to ask her to take them down. What happened next would have council press officers across the country waking up screaming.</p> <p>Argyll and Bute council found itself on the receiving end of a gale force 10 Twitter storm, not only slammed for its original decision but for its failure to respond to public criticism \u2013 and then for the response the council finally made.</p> <p>It took a live apology and climbdown from the council leader on BBC Radio 4's World at One for the council to get a grip on the situation. What had started as a minor internal issue had become a national and then global debating point.</p> <p>The interesting issue here is how quickly this kind of news can spread; local issues are not actually local any more. A recent campaign run on <a href=\"http://www.change.org/en-GB\" title=\"\">Change.org</a> over the proposed building of cemetery next to a children's hospice attracted more than 6,000 signatures from accross the UK.</p> <p>The councillors in question told reporters that they were not interested in the views of people who weren't local. The point may be a reasonable one, but it's largely irrelevant. You don't have to be a resident in a particular area to make a moral call on an issue happening there. What is more, the fact is that 6,000 people are letting your council know they think you are wrong. This is a significant campaign, and should be recognised.</p> <p>Campaigns that once took weeks and months to gain momentum can now rise and fall in a matter of hours or days. At a time when society is facing a collapse of public trust in our political institutions post-expenses scandal and the Leveson Inquiry, citizens feel more confident than ever to stand up for issues they care about. Sites like <a href=\"http://www.change.org/en-GB\" title=\"\">Change.org</a> give individuals the chance to start and build campaigns fast.</p> <p>The point of the site has always been to give people the tools they need to campaign on the changes they want to see. Forward-thinking local authorities will not make themselves prepared to deal with this new frontier, they will embrace it too.</p> <p>Research shows that when people take action online, they are more likely to do something offline too; this means active, engaged citizens who are more likely to vote and may even be more likely to engage in positive community activities. You must be ready to deal with the new wave of web-savvy citizenship, but if planned for and responded to properly, the opportunities for strengthening local democracy are genuinely exciting for everyone.</p> <p><em>John Coventry is communications director at </em><a href=\"http://www.change.org/en-GB\" title=\"\"><em>Change.org</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/local-government-network/2011/oct/10/join-local-government-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the local government network</strong></a><strong> for more comment, analysis and </strong><a href=\"http://localgovernmentjobs.guardian.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest jobs</strong></a><strong> direct to you</strong></p>",
  "<p>The north-eastern city of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisborne,_New_Zealand\" title=\"\">Gisborne</a> is divided and people are angry. It's not the issue of water ownership that threatens the peace of this normally unflappable community, or whether local farms should be flogged to Chinese dairy giants. Even escalating rate bills hardly raise a sweat, let alone the imminent commencement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/shale-gas\" title=\"\">fracking</a> operations in nearby hills. The cause of the fury is the latest craze for wearing pyjamas in public, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/28/tesco-bans-shopping-bananas-pyjamas\" title=\"\">especially noticeable in the supermarkets</a>. The fashion has been initiated by women but bets are on as to how long it will be before men sew up their flies and join in.</p> <p>Letters to the local paper, mostly unsigned, are split between \"Disgusted\" and \"I Love my PJs\". In favour of parading their nightwear in public are shoppers who plan to go back to bed as soon as the supermarket shop is done, and others who say they can't afford dry cleaning so they live in their night clothes. Then there those who admit to being more comfortable in pyjamas and don't care about the opinions of others. \"I am not ashamed\", said one woman, hitching up her slipping trousers as she bent over to unload her trolley.</p> <p>Angry pronouncements against public PJ wearing include accusations of laziness and unhygienic behaviour. One writer suggested that pyjamas will bring lice and bed bugs into food shops. Someone else argued that if people wanted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2011/oct/30/pyjamas-fashion-sarah-harris\" title=\"\">wear pyjamas in public</a> they should go to Dubai or London. Another person fumed that even in Nepal people dress nicely. \"Where is your pride?\" the writer asked.</p> <p>The district council is being urged to issue a ban on the wearing of pyjamas in public, day or night, and for offenders to be fined. Whether this would lead to pyjama police patrolling the streets is unclear.</p> <p>Has Gisborne, a geographically remote city, set a new benchmark in fashion?&#xa0;Imagine my surprise therefore when, the other morning in the city I saw a man wearing a dark grey, bespoke suit, a silk tie and black polished Oxfords. Perhaps he was a visiting lawyer or a stockbroker selling shares in a fracking company. The point is he stood out among the informal crowds and was easily outnumbered by pyjamas.</p> <p>I realised then how fickle fashion is. Suits could be back tomorrow.

  "<h2>New dawn in Indianapolis is... familiar </h2> <p>When Bruce Arians called the play, he had no clue what he was about to do. His intentions were to ease a rookie quarterback into his first ever NFL game with a simple pass. The player's results potential cranked up the pressure even more.</p> <p>Arians is the Indianapolis Colts' new offensive coordinator. He is the main man responsible for the development of the team's new quarterback, Andrew Luck. </p> <p>On Luck's first ever pass in the NFL, Arians called a play designed to throw the ball to his running back on a screen pass. In other words, the safest possible play call he could think of. Luck carried out the play with ease, but running back Donald Brown decided to turn what was supposed to be a quiet starting point into a tornado of hype, sending the expectations of a fanbase towards the skies.</p> <p>You see, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q7zE1WSiaU\">when Brown broke off a 63-yard sprint into the end zone for Luck's first ever touchdown, he wasn't just scoring in a preseason game against the St Louis Rams</a>. He was also starting off the Luck era in Indianapolis with a fitting salute to the departed.</p> <p>Fourteen years before Brown caught Luck's first pass and took it to the end zone, Bruce Arians was the quarterbacks coach in Indianapolis. Arians wasn't calling plays at that time, but he was on the sidelines when his rookie quarterback of the time, Peyton Manning, threw his first pass. Manning's first pass was not too dissimilar to Luck's. Manning threw a quick slant to Marvin Harrison, but Harrison carried it another 48 yards and began the quarterback's legendary career with a touchdown.</p> <p>While those two plays were eerily similar to each other, what was to follow was downright scary.</p> <p>For a long time now, this year's first overall pick, Andrew Luck, has been compared to Peyton Manning. Both were taken first in the draft by the Colts. Both are sons of former NFL quarterbacks. They have similar demeanors. Both were considered superstar prospects coming out of college. </p> <p>Still, even after all of that, nobody expected Luck to play like Manning straight away.</p> <p>Luck hasn't played like Manning did during his first two preseason games \u2013 he has surpassed him. Luck abused the St Louis Rams defense as if he were a 10-year veteran, before showing excellent mental strength, character and not least talent against a strong Pittsburgh Steelers unit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxQ2a69WSsM&amp;feature=related\">It may be time to start believing the hype</a>.</p> <h2>Peyton's new place</h2> <p>Is there a long way to go? Yes. Has there been a little bit of rust? Yes. Is he 100%? Maybe not. Is he healthy? Yes. Can he still play the game? You bet.</p> <p>Manning is used to scrutiny \u2013 you don't become a hall of fame quarterback and four-time MVP of the league without enduring plenty of it \u2013 and if the first two preseason games are anything to go by, he will have an awful lot of questions to answer this year.</p> <p>Statistically it may not look pretty so far. He has thrown three interceptions without a single touchdown pass. But statistics don't matter in the preseason. The most important thing for the Denver Broncos is Manning's health. He has shown no signs of caution on the field. As he has throughout his career, he has shown great poise and bravery in live action, with no shortage of awareness.</p> <p>The one notable issue with Manning at the moment is his deep ball. After a handful of neck surgeries and over a year out of the game, only a fool would have expected him to walk back on to the field at full strength. His strength will return as the season grows and his accuracy should improve from week to week when throwing deep. Manning is definitely not in rebuild mode, he just has to refine his skills slightly. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7xFhwgok4E&amp;feature=related\">It has not always been pretty, but there have been plenty of vintage Manning moments already</a>.</p> <h2>The Butterfly Effect</h2> <p>For one moment, just consider what would have happened if Cam Newton, and Andy Dalton to a lesser extent, had had horrible rookie seasons in 2011. Do you think that five rookies and one second-year quarterback would now be joining the four carry-over rookie starters from last season? After two weeks of the preseason, that remains a possibility. If Newton hadn't blown up the record books, it likely wouldn't.</p> <p>In today's quarterback-friendly league, teams are much more willing to trust young quarterbacks. Because of that, players like Ryan Tannehill and Russell Wilson proved to have much greater chances of winning the starting jobs with their respective teams than any outsiders expected. Usually, by now rookie quarterbacks are attending clipboard-holding seminars to prepare for their first few seasons in the league. Instead, Tannehill, Brandon Weeden, Robert Griffin III and Andrew Luck are all set to start from week one, with Wilson still battling to join them.</p> <p>Wilson has already beaten out one quarterback in Seattle, as <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/eye-on-football/19826262/seahawks-attempts-to-trade-tarvaris-jackson-to-intensify-this-week\">the Seahawks are actively trying to trade incumbent starter Tarvaris Jackson</a>. If the Seahawks can't trade Jackson they will cut him, leaving only Matt Flynn in Wilson's way.</p> <p>Flynn was signed in free agency this off-season from the Green Bay Packers, after a couple of excellent appearances in Aaron Rodgers' place. Even though he is a four-year veteran, Flynn has only started two games and is also learning the system. He doesn't have that great an advantage over Wilson.</p> <p>It is still, essentially, impossible to separate Wilson and Flynn. Wilson has performed better in the first two preseason games but he hasn't faced the same level of opposition as Flynn. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll has a tough decision to make.</p> <p>Among the other four rookie quarterbacks, the only legitimate competition took place in Miami. New Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin had a less troublesome controversy to deal with once David Garrard was injured. Between Tannehill and veteran Matt Moore, there is a clear divide in value and talent.<a href=\"http://cianfaheycolumns.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/breaking-down-the-tape-of-ryan-tannehills-first-game-for-the-miami-dolphins/\"> Not only has Tannehill looked better in the preseason so far</a>, he is also the future of the franchise. </p> <p>Moore didn't do enough last year to be considered a long-term option. Tannehill has looked like a rookie at times, but he has also shown off why the Dolphins took him with the eighth overall pick.</p> <p>The first real winner of a quarterback competition, discounting the Cleveland Browns' farce with Colt McCoy, is last year's eighth overall pick, Jake Locker. Despite neither he nor veteran Matt Hasselbeck being overly impressive during the preseason to date, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000052160/article/titans-name-jake-locker-the-starting-quarterback\">the Titans have announced that Locker will be the team's starter this year</a>. It comes as no surprise, really: Locker is 24 and <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1192471-tennessee-titans-offense-set-up-perfectly-for-jake-locker-to-take-over-in-2012\">the offense was crafted to his skill-set during the off-season</a>.</p> <h2>Receiving is a young man's game</h2> <p>The biggest star of week one of the season \u2013 an honour every player dreams of earning, I know! \u2013 was undoubtedly Julio Jones of the Atlanta Falcons. In one quick quarter, against what is likely to be one of the best secondaries in the NFL this year, the Baltimore Ravens, Jones caught six passes for 109 yards and a touchdown. </p> <p>Not to be outdone, in week two the Detroit Lions' Calvin Johnson reminded everyone of why he's the most dominant receiver in the game today. Johnson had five receptions for 111 yards and a touchdown \u2013 also against the Ravens \u2013 despite being covered well most of the time.</p> <p>Young, star wide receivers are littered through the NFL these days and that is making life tough on some of the position's elder statesmen. Guaranteed hall of fame players like Randy Moss and Terrell Owens are fighting for roster spots, while Chad Johnson (formerly Ochocinco, formerly Johnson) was recently <a href=\"http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/08/13/dolphins-release-chad-johnson-after-domestic-battery-arrest/\">released from the Miami Dolphins after being arrested and not overly impressing in training camp</a>.</p> <p>Each of those players are well into their thirties, but none of them lacks the physical ability to succeed in the NFL. In fact, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1293015-san-francisco-49ers-randy-moss-should-challenge-peyton-manning-for-cpoy-award\">Randy Moss remains a physical specimen of the highest order</a>, while <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp12/story/_/id/8240307/terrell-owens-signs-contract-seattle-seahawks\">Terrell Owens went crazy in a workout to earn his chance with the Seattle Seahawks</a>. Chad Johnson's struggles came with catching the ball, opposed to getting open.</p> <p>Moss was anonymous in his debut for the 49ers, catching zero passes, before tallying just three receptions for 24 yards in week two. He was brought in by the 49ers to be an impact player \u2013 his career has been determined by his ability to get deep and beat defenders to the football. So far in the preseason, he hasn't shown the ability to do that. </p> <p>After signing with the Seahawks late, Owens wasn't involved against the Tennessee Titans in the team's first game and he had zero receptions against the Broncos in week two. In that second game, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/0ap2000000052027/Terrell-Owens-drops-pass-in-end-zone\">Owens dropped a sure touchdown pass on a play he has routinely made throughout his career</a>. It may just be rust, but Owens will have to play well over the next two games if he is to really be back in the NFL.</p> <p>Nobody is sure what is going to happen to Johnson. Since being let go by the Dolphins, <a href=\"http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/national/evelyn-lozada-chad-johnson-divorce-johnson-dispute-with-wife-and-termination-shown-on-hard-knocks\">his wife has left him, he has lost multiple endorsements and his reality television show has been cancelled</a>. Johnson may just be better off focusing on his personal life for the moment, but at 34 there is not much time left for him in the game.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/video/xsvkm?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe frameborder=\"0\" width=\"460\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xsvkm8\"></iframe><br /><a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xsvkm8_dolphins-release-wr-chad-johnson-on-hbo-s-hard-knocks_sport\" target=\"_blank\">Dolphins Release WR Chad Johnson On HBO&#039;s Hard...</a> <i>by <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/BigBlueBruiser\" target=\"_blank\">BigBlueBruiser</a></i> </figure>   <p></p> <h2>Only two holdouts remain</h2> <p>After a lengthy holdout and contract dispute throughout the whole off-season, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp12/story/_/id/8278271/kansas-city-chiefs-wide-receiver-dwayne-bowe-signs-franchise-tender\">the Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Dwayne Bowe arrived at training camp last Friday to sign his tender</a>. With Bowe signed, only two players remain away from their teams after two preseason games: the Jacksonville Jaguars' Maurice Jones-Drew and Mike Wallace of the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p> <p>While Wallace is technically not signed, he was given a tender during the off-season as a restricted free agent. Jones-Drew is withholding his services, despite having two years remaining on his deal. Either way, the result is the same. Neither the Steelers nor the Jaguars appear willing to discuss a new deal with their star players until they turn up with their teammates. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000052128/article/jaguars-move-forward-as-maurice-jonesdrew-holds-out\">the Jaguars don't appear willing to even entertain the idea of giving Jones-Drew a new deal</a>.</p> <p>A large reason for each team's resilience in each case is the performances of each player's replacement. Instead of Wallace signing a long-term deal with the Steelers, the franchise gave Antonio Brown a new deal, worth $42.5m, when he turned up to training camp. Brown broke records for the Steelers last year and was voted the team's MVP. After receiving his deal, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGdqmZLQyeU\">Brown celebrated with a big touchdown run against the Colts</a>. </p> <p>Jones-Drew led the league in rushing last year, with 1,606 yards. However, the Jaguars appear more than willing to move on with his backup, Rashad Jennings, into the regular season. Jennings has impressed in Jones-Drew's place in preseason, averaging over five yards per carry. As part of an offense with a new rookie receiver, Justin Blackmon, and the improving Blaine Gabbert, the Jaguars feel pretty comfortable without Jones-Drew.</p> <p>Neither of these holdouts should last much longer but Wallace's has the potential to carry on well into the season, as he is not under any real pressure to report until week 10. Unlike Jones-Drew, who has a signed contract, Wallace only needs to play six games this year in order to avoid punishment for not signing his restricted free agent tender.</p>",
  "<p>Of growing concern over the last decade has been the creeping gradualism of climate change: the ppm-by-ppm (parts per million) carbon gas increase, the degree-by-degree temperature change, the millimetre-by-millimetre sea-level rise. Now your Special report: unmanned drones <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/04/future-drones?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(10 August)</a> highlights a more immediate problem: the prospect of pilot-free aviation guided by artificial intelligence.

  "<p>The tips of young walnut trees are just visible above the ready-to-harvest wheat. There are rows of them and they should produce fine wood for cabinetmakers in 30 years or so. Further away, oaks, ashes and cherry trees are growing in fields of sunflowers and broad beans, all signs of the return to agroforestry in La Bergerie de Villarceaux, an organic experimental farm in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexin\" title=\"\">Vexin region</a> of north-west France.</p> <p>Olivier Ranke and his team are pioneers. Ten years ago they started replanting hedges in a part of France where intensive farming is the norm and there is scarcely a shrub on the horizon. In 2011 they took the next step by launching the most ambitious agroforestry project in northern France and planted more than 600 trees in 23 hectares of farmland.</p> <p>\"This type of farming, where crops and trees grow in the same field, is an age-old practice that has been updated by recent agronomic research. In the 19th century, in the <em>bocages</em> [mixed woodland and pastureland] of the Perche region of France, apple trees often grew in the grasslands,\" said Fabien Liagre, president of <a href=\"http://www.agroof.net/\" title=\"\">Agroof</a>, an agroforestry research institute advising the farm. \"Farmers are becoming increasingly aware of how poor their soil has become, leading to a fall in production. Trees are a very good way of improving the soil while producing wood, which is an additional source of revenue,\" he said.</p> <p>The practice had all but disappeared in France until recently, but now some 3,000 hectares a year are being converted to agroforestry, boosted by the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/pol/agr/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">Common Agricultural Policy</a> which, under pressure from agricultural organisations and unions, has made such land eligible for European subsidies since 2006.</p> <p>Christian Dupraz, a researcher at the <a href=\"http://www.international.inra.fr/\" title=\"\">National Institute for Agronomic Research</a> (INRA) in Montpellier, has been studying this type of mixed farming for the past 20 years. He believes in the importance of switching to \"agro-ecological\" systems that do not depend on the petrochemical industry. \"The fertility of French land is due to its forests, which have enriched it with carbon. Planting trees can replace chemical fertilisers,\" he said.</p> <p>He believes there are many advantages to agroforestry. \"If the trees are pruned regularly and given enough space, they can grow three times faster,\" he said. \"Their shade helps to offset some of the impact of global warming since it slows down evaporation. Furthermore, the additional biodiversity they bring helps to protect the crops. Thanks to the trees, the birds return to feed off the insects, which limits the use of chemicals.\" The roots of the trees slow down soil erosion and act as natural filters, reducing the penetration of pollutants.</p> <p>The trees also provide money for the farmer, which Christian Dupraz estimates to be around \u20ac6,000 ($7,400) per hectare for 12-year-old poplars. Not to mention biomass from the pruning of branches, which can be sold in pellets for heating.</p> <p>Those advantages are highlighted by the organisations petitioning for agroforestry to be recognised as an efficient agricultural practice, justifying regional, national and European financing. A recent \"Trees and Agriculture\" event organised by the <a href=\"http://www.agroforesterie.fr/\" title=\"\">French Agroforestry Association in Marciac</a> (Gers department) last month was a success with the public and showed that scientists and farmers are not the only people interested in the role of trees in the countryside.</p> <p>Alain Canet, chairman of the association, hopes that such actions will lead to an agroforestry profession, enabling people to train and help farmers implement this method throughout France, for it is not a technique that can just be improvised.</p> <p>\"To maintain a normal cereal crop yield, you have to limit the number of trees to 100 per hectare, otherwise their branches form a real screen and prevent the necessary light from reaching the crops,\" explained Ranke. He has followed INRA's recommendations in his fields and planted the trees 10 metres apart. He has also left a 50-metre gap between each row so that agricultural machines can pass.</p> <p>So why has this model not caught on more in France? As usual, it is a matter of cost. Even if farmers benefit rapidly from the advantages, the considerable investment required to launch an agroforestry project tends to cool their ardour. In addition to buying the trees, they have to pay the high cost of metal railings to protect the trunks from wild animals and herds of cattle. The 23 hectares planted at Bergerie de Villarceaux cost \u20ac42,000, half of which was subsidised by the Ile-de-France region. Only \u20ac4,000 of that was for the trees and for planting them, and \u20ac38,000 was for the fencing.</p> <p>Nevertheless, scientists and organisations promoting agroforestry hope that it will become part of the \"greening\" of the CAP when reforms are implemented in 2014.</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",

Why did inflation edge up again when we are constantly assured the growth capacity of the economy is so feeble it can't be a serious threat? Why exactly have North Sea gas and oil tax revenues dipped so sharply?</p> <p>When we don't really know we should say so. But there's no alternative to hard slog, and smarter decisions on everything from tax rates and education to investment \u2013 not to mention disinvestment. The latter seems more popular with many British owners of capital who queue up to grab their cash from foreign buyers and run \u2013 despite getting most of the deregulation, flexible labour laws and soft tax regimes they first asked Margaret Thatcher for 30 years ago.</p> <p>For want of an alternative hero this summer the Tory panacea merchants are trumpeting Michael Gove's reforms to school structures and curriculums. On Andrew Lansley's health reforms they are strangely silent, perhaps because Gove is better at courting columnists. The Gove-ites make several good points, but they do not have a panacea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394997826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345552917029/Daniel-Hannan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Hannan\" width=\"220\" height=\"348\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Hannan MEP.

Since Dan is using the matrimonial analogy he should know, as a good, cultural conservative, that divorce can be a guarantee of familiar problems bathed in regret as much as a solution. He wants Britain to be more like Switzerland, Norway or even Qatar.</p> <p>OK Dan, if you say so. But being a bit more like Germany might be nice, though I did hear a startled Portuguese who had left her family to work there saying on the radio this week that, contrary to what Germans keep telling her, the Portuguese work much harder. No panacea there either.</p> <p>The awkward fact for the Eurosceptics is that, annoying though EU regulations are, foolishly designed though the euro-currency project was, feeble though Brussels foreign policy usually manages to become, there's nothing to stop us doing most of what we want as a country \u2013 if we still have the will and capacity to do it.</p> <p>We can export all we want to India or China. No one stops us. We can give rich Chinese tourists (I've never typed that before) a better visa deal and run our own foreign policy and economy. And our banking system got into trouble with no help from those pesky Europeans. We kept our own currency (Hannan rarely credits Gordon Brown for that) and have devalued it mightily since 2007.</p> <p>Yet it still hasn't done the trick. Export statistics are disappointing too, and we can't blame Brussels for that either, only ourselves and the complacent view expressed by Hannan in the Mail that \"what matters to a modern economy is not its size but its tax rate, its regulatory regime and its business climate.\"</p> <p>If it was that simple we'd be doing a lot better \u2013 and China would be doing a lot worse. But no, George Osborne prefers to follow the austerity model being imposed on the eurozone by, yes, Germany. He doesn't have to do that either, but says he must. So much for illusory freedom in a downward spiral.</p>",
  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Critics have remarked that historical animated adventure <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a> doesn't quite boast the trademark originality of a Pixar film, but UK box-office has been pretty robust. Following 10 days in Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland that yielded \u00a32.22m, expansion last Monday into England and Wales saw seven-day takings across the whole region of just over \u00a36m, for a total to date of \u00a38.27m. The film grossed \u00a32.60m over the Friday-to-Sunday period.</p> <p>The eccentric release pattern makes comparisons with previous Pixar movies tricky: last summer, for what it's worth, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142460/cars-2\" title=\"\">Cars 2</a> debuted with three-day takings of \u00a33.54m. On the other hand, there is one comparison it is possible to make: earlier this summer, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> opened in the same territories two weeks early, and boosted its opening tally in England and Wales with four days of previews. After 17 days of play in the Irish and Scottish territories and seven days in England and Wales, it stood at \u00a313.05m, compared to \u00a38.27m for Brave.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/11/brave-pixar-young-female-film-leads\" title=\"\">Received wisdom in Hollywood</a> states that a family film with a female protagonist is a riskier proposition, since girls will see a film about a boy, but not so much vice versa. If Brave proves a solid performer, we should see this argument being advanced less often.</p> <h2>The runner-up</h2> <p>When Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon opted not to make a fourth Bourne movie, Universal certainly had cause for despondency. Could the studio extend the franchise with a new character? So far, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a>, the answer would seem to be yes, with a \u00a34.62m opening for the latest instalment, starring Jeremy Renner as fellow rogue operative <a href=\"http://bourne.wikia.com/wiki/Aaron_Cross\" title=\"\">Aaron Cross</a>. Examine the small print, and it's a tad less impressive \u2013 four days of previews contributed \u00a32.52m of that total. Likewise, comparisons to previous Bourne movies do not flatter: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119889/bourne.ultimatum\" title=\"\">The Bourne Ultimatum</a> debuted with \u00a36.55m including \u00a31.24m from a single day of previews. Even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/101541/bourne.supremacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Supremacy</a>, with \u00a32.72m including \u00a3361,000 in previews, took a bit more over the official Friday-to-Sunday period than The Bourne Legacy.</p> <h2>The \u00a320m club</h2> <p>Seth Macfarlane's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a> is the 10th release so far this year to crack \u00a320m at the UK box-office, and with \u00a322.19m is in fact 2012's seventh biggest hit. It's currently beaten by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">Marvel Avengers Assemble</a> (\u00a351.8m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (\u00a349.7m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4</a> (\u00a327.6m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\">Amazing Spider-Man</a> (\u00a325.7m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> (\u00a324.7m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a> (\u00a323.8m). However Ted has achieved its tally in just three weeks, and there's more life in the talking bear yet.</p> <p>Ted's weekend takings of \u00a32.08m meant that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"\">The Expendables 2</a>, with \u00a31.99m including \u00a3435,000 in previews, landed in disappointing fourth place. Exactly two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131950/expendables\" title=\"\">The Expendables</a> debuted at the top with \u00a33.94m, including previews totaling \u00a31.80m. Lionsgate, the film's backer, will point to the weekend heatwave experienced by much of England as an inhibiting factor, as well as a tougher competitive environment in cinemas, but it's hard not to conclude that UK audience appetite for this franchise has significantly diminished.</p> <h2>The record-breaker</h2> <p>The weekend saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> overtake <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122806/dark.knight\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight</a> (\u00a349m) to become the biggest Batman movie ever at the UK box-office. It's also entered the All Time Top 20, sandwiched between Harry Potter films <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119377/harry.potter.and.the.order.of.the.phoenix\" title=\"\">Order of the Phoenix</a> (\u00a349.9m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/109039/harry.potter.and.the.goblet.of.fire\" title=\"\">Goblet of Fire</a> (\u00a349.2m).</p> <p>The Dark Knight Rises was one of five films that grossed \u00a31m at the weekend (see chart, below), the first time that a quintet of pictures achieved that feat since April. Overall, there's much more strength in depth in the chart than has been observed lately, with 10th placed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148837/wedding-video\" title=\"\">The Wedding Video</a> grossing \u00a3333,000. This compares with just three weeks ago, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146340/men-in-black-iii\" title=\"\">Men in Black 3</a> earned 10th place with just \u00a334,500, the lowest figure for a film in the UK top 10 in many years.</p> <h2>The Bollywood hit</h2> <p>Following his smash hit action comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143224/bodyguard\" title=\"\">Bodyguard</a> nearly a year ago, Salman Khan delivers another big opening with thriller Ek Tha Tiger, a globetrotting saga that sends him as a secret agent to Dublin, Istanbul, Kazakhstan and Chile. The film debuted with \u00a3543,000, including previews of \u00a3142,000. That's down on Bodyguard (\u00a3840,000 including previews of \u00a3408,000), but is nevertheless the biggest opening for a Bollywood film so far this year, eclipsing Housefull 2 (\u00a3396,000 including previews).</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Thanks to the arrival of Brave and Bourne, and the films' Monday openings contributing generous portions of preview takings, overall the market is 105% up on the previous weekend. However, the frame is still 22% down on the 2011 equivalent, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie\" title=\"\">The Inbetweeners Movie</a> contributed a colossal \u00a313.2m including previews. The coming weekend represents a huge unknown quantity for cinemas since Keith Lemon: The Film is exceptionally hard to call. Rarely has a picture been so systematically protected from assessment by professional critics. Alternatives include comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a>, starring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147184/three-stooges\" title=\"\">The Three Stooges</a>, the latter surely a distribution challenge in the UK. Acclaimed documentary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a> could make waves in a becalmed arthouse sector. IRA drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145818/shadow-dancer\" title=\"\">Shadow Dancer</a>, starring Andrea Riseborough and Clive Owen, aims to steer a middle path.</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p>1.

  "<p>At an African Union summit meeting in January, Meles Zenawi, the taciturn Ethiopian prime minister, made a <a href=\"http://au.int/en/summit/18thsummit/speeches/remarks-he-ato-meles-zenawi-prime-ministre-federal-democratic-republic-ethiopia-\" title=\"\">terse, punchy speech, expressing his admiration for China</a>.</p> <p>Meles, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses\" title=\"\">whose death was announced</a> on Tuesday by the Ethiopian government, spoke of China's \"amazing re-emergence\" and its important role in Africa's renaissance. The Ethiopian strongman's lavish praise of China owed much to the occasion \u2013 the inauguration of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/jan/27/constructive-criticism-intra-african-trade\" title=\"\">swanky African Union headquarters donated by Chinese labour and money</a> at a cost of $200m.</p> <p>But his admiration for China, coupled with an attack on \"market fundamentalist\" ideas that he said had wrecked African economies, was heartfelt. Under his long rule \u2013 since the overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991, Meles has dominated Ethiopian politics \u2013 Ethiopia has pursued a top-down model of development, much like China.</p> <p>The result has been impressive economic growth. Ethiopia has achieved annual economic growth of more than 7% for the past decade. As a result of rising agricultural output, officials expect economic growth of 11% for the 2011-12 fiscal year that ended in June, although inflation remains stubbornly high, hitting 20% in July.</p> <p>Ethiopia's strong economic record and stability in the volatile Horn of Africa have made it a magnet for donors. Over the past year alone, USAid, the US agency for international development, has given Ethiopia \u2013 considered a key American ally \u2013 $675m in aid, and Britain's Department for International Development (DfID) will spend <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/ethiopia\" title=\"\">an average of \u00a3331m a year there until 2015</a>.</p> <p>\"Since it came to power in 1991, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EDRDF) has consolidated a capable government that is demonstrably committed to addressing poverty \u2013 with an impressive record of pro-poor spending, sound financial management and a strong commitment to fight corruption,\" says DfID.</p> <p>Ethiopia, however, remains one of the world's poorest countries, with around 25 million out of a population of 85 million living in extreme poverty. Still, Meles won praise for his leadership. Bill Clinton, the former US president, said Meles was part of a \"new generation\" of African leaders, and he was invited to join Tony Blair's <a href=\"http://www.commissionforafrica.info/\" title=\"\">Commission for Africa</a>.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, the UK's former prime minister, was fulsome in his praise of Meles. \"Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in the world, made more progress in education, health and economic development under his leadership than at any time in its history, and it is a tragedy for the Ethiopian people that they have lost a committed leader and a champion of children at such a young age,\" he said. \"When I last saw him earlier this year we held meetings about how we would ensure every child would be in school in Ethiopia by 2015. His passion was in abolishing poverty and our hope is that he will inspire a new generation of men and women who will champion the cause of eradicating poverty.\"</p> <p>But although Meles won plaudits for his economic record, the government's intolerance of dissent earned it criticism from human rights groups and the UN, and poses <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/feb/03/ethiopia-human-rights-questions\" title=\"\">awkward questions for aid donors</a>. In July, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18825538\" title=\"\">Eskinder Nega, a prominent journalist and blogger, was sentenced to 18 years in prison</a>, and an opposition activist, Andualem Arage, was given a life sentence for breaking anti-terrorism laws.</p> <p>Other journalists have been charged under the same sweeping anti-terrorism law that was introduced in 2009, prompting Navi Pillay, the UN high commissioner of human rights, to say journalists, human rights defenders and critics were facing a \"climate of intimidation\" in Ethiopia.</p> <p>The Ethiopian government's authoritarianism has puzzled observers, as Meles faced no viable opposition following a disputed parliamentary election in 2005. After violent demonstrations, in which 200 protesters were killed, Ethiopia rounded up almost the entire leadership of an opposition group that won all 23 seats in Addis Ababa and jailed them for life for treason.</p> <p>Since then, the political opposition has been toothless; many of its leading figures have given up and gone abroad. Civil society has effectively been strangled under a 2009 NGO law. The law prohibits human rights organisations in Ethiopia from receiving more than 10% of their funding from foreign sources \u2013 effectively shutting down human rights groups, since they cannot survive without substantial foreign funding.</p> <p>In legislative elections in 2010, Ethiopia's ruling party and its allies won virtually all the parliamentary seats, leaving the opposition with only two, in a result that embarrassed the regime. European observers said the election fell short of international standards.</p> <p>DfID has acknowledged Ethiopia's democratic deficit, even while it disburses large amounts of aid. \"Ethiopia has made some progress toward establishing a functioning democracy, but there is a long way to go,\" said DfID in its <a href=\"http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/publications1/op/ethiopia-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">2011-15 operational plan for Ethiopia</a>. \"The UK government continues to raise concerns about limitations on civil and political rights and the longer term sustainability of Ethiopia's tightly controlled political model.\"</p> <p>Such concerns are likely to be acute after Meles's sudden death. As Dr Adekeye Adebajo, executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, South Africa, recently noted, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/08/meles-zenawi-profile-ethiopia-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Meles dominated domestic politics to the extent that a power vacuum on his departure seems certain</a>. With that in mind, it is unlikely that the succession will be smooth.</p>",
  "<p>Li Wei, 18 (not her real name), doesn't seem like a dissident. She is more focused on her accounting studies, her friends on the social networks and chatting with her sister. Nevertheless, she took part in a demonstration last month in front of the Chinese Communist party offices that degenerated into violent clashes with police.</p> <p>The demonstrators gathered at dawn in Qidong, a small coastal town north of Shanghai. By noon, the local government headquarters were occupied and files were being thrown out of the windows. In the heat of the moment the party secretary's shirt was ripped off. \"We have to get mobilised to protect the environment, it's our home town,\" explained Li, from her parents' restaurant.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/china-anti-pollution-protest-copper\" title=\"\">Protests against pollution</a> have multiplied in China as people become better informed and more concerned about the heavy ecological cost of economic development. Even state media now stresses the environment is a priority for China. Young people use micro-blogging to pass on the word. \"People understand that the fight against pollution is a personal right, for there are very few places in the world where industrialisation has had such a massive and direct impact on such a large number of people,\" said environmental activist Ma Jun.</p> <p>Earlier this summer there were student-led protests against a copper alloy plant in Shifang, central Sichuan province. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/03/chinese-cancels-copper-plant-protests\" title=\"\">local authorities quickly scrapped the project</a>. In August 2011 a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/14/china-protest-against-px-chemical-plant\" title=\"\">similar protest broke out in the industrial port of Dalian</a> in the north-east, which mobilised 12,000 people. The authorities gave way there too.</p> <p>In Qidong, locals were protesting against plans by a Japanese-owned paper mill to build a wastewater pipeline close to a small port. \"Many people earn a living from fishing here. That project jeopardised their livelihoods,\" said Li. She had learned about it on an internet forum and felt she had to do something. \"Protecting the environment is our generation's responsibility, we have a better understanding about these issues.\"</p> <p>Oji, the plant's owners, had stated that the waste would be treated before being discharged into the sea but the locals are sceptical, convinced that they are not being told the truth about the extent of the pollution \u2013 let alone the outcome of the demonstrations. The local hospital reported that a dozen people were treated for light wounds, but rumours say that three people were killed in the clashes.</p> <p>The government is concerned by these demonstrations. An editorial in the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/\" title=\"\">People's Daily</a>, the communist party organ, stated that \"the public is rapidly becoming aware of environmental issues and its rights\", and went on to accuse local governments of failing to consult the people in such cases, but without suggesting any real alternatives.</p> <p>According to Yang Guobin, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania who researches environmental activism, the government's response was typical of the Chinese leadership in President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hu-jintao\" title=\"\">Hu Jintao</a>'s era. \"The government's response is typical of their '<em>wei wen</em>' approach [the policy of maintaining stability at all costs] and stopping any widescale demonstrations, by force if necessary. But should state coercion fail, the government will immediately make some concessions to prevent the movement from escalating. In all cases, it acts fast,\" summed up Yang.</p> <p>Li Wei regrets that the protest degenerated. \"It went too far, the local government offices suffered a great deal of damage. That's a waste, because the government's money is the people's money.\"</p> <p>But it was difficult for people to co-ordinate better. Official requests to hold the protest were turned down and the only environmental NGOs countenanced by the government are tolerated precisely because they steer clear of any confrontation. \"In future we will have to find a mechanism for consultation between the various parties concerned prior to any new industrial project,\" said Ma, the environmental activist.</p> <p>At the crossroads in the centre of Qidong, news of the people's victory was splashed across a massive advertising screen, where the government statement announced that the wastewater project was to be abandoned. Nevertheless, the government bussed in anti-riot police from around the province, just in case.</p> <p>Thousands of blue-uniformed police were stationed in the city while the khaki-clad armed police units in helmets and wielding truncheons, blocked all the streets in the centre. For Li, who had never taken part in a demonstration before, this was a reality check. Not because of the local police intervention \u2013 she heard Qidong police slipping in the occasional \"<em>jia you!</em>\" (go on!), an expression more commonly used to encourage athletes \u2013 but the ensuing state repression.</p> <p>\"They pulled us by the hair. They slapped one girl in the face,\" she exclaimed, before switching to English: \"I really wanted to say to them, 'Fuck you!'\"</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",
  "<p>In March 2005, when Tony Blair released the <a href=\"http://www.commissionforafrica.info/2005-report\" title=\"Commission for Africa report, downloadable\">Commission for Africa report</a> he had sponsored as prime minister, it seemed he had gathered together a winning team: a popular icon of British society, Bob Geldof; his own rival, Gordon Brown; and the best that Africa could offer by way of leaders who wanted to join Africa to the modern world \u2013 among others, South Africa's finance minister, Trevor Manuel, and Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi.</p> <p>Meles, in particular, seemed like a younger counterpart to Nelson Mandela. Then only 50, he had been a rebel leader waging war against communist dictatorship, and was now a democrat leading Africa's oldest independent state forwards to a new age of development and modern political values. However, times change and the image of Meles at his death is a far more contradictory one. He has died aged 57 of undisclosed causes, after hospital treatment.</p> <p>Ethiopia's May 2005 elections saw protests that led to the deaths of almost 200 people with 800 wounded. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/26/ethiopia-election-result-meles-zenawi\" title=\"Guardian report, 26 May 2005\">European Union observers declared the elections to have failed international standards</a>, while the <a href=\"http://www.cartercenter.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Carter Centre</a>, the US-based organisation founded by former president Jimmy Carter, said they were fair notwithstanding irregularities and intimidation. The international community by and large accepted the outcome.</p> <p>Although the 2010 elections were not marred by protests of the same scale, opposition parties saw them as flawed and said the relationship between Meles's party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), and the army had created a one-party state \u2013 with opposition parties permitted only to give a semblance of democracy in order to court the west.</p> <p>From 2006 to 2009, with US assistance, the Ethiopian army mounted an invasion of neighbouring Somalia with the aim of destroying the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), the ruling Islamic militia. Fighting in Mogadishu was fierce, with many accusations of indiscriminate Ethiopian armoured tactics. But the defeat of the ICU left a space for the even more radical Al-Shabaab group, leaving the US-backed Ethiopian intervention a strategic failure.</p> <p>Meles was in the forefront of supporting the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad), one of the parallel engagements between the west and Africa alongside Blair's Commission for Africa, whereby democracy would be encouraged by African peer review, and helped by western largesse.</p> <p>Meles's most prominent recent international activity was in the environmental field. He took a lead on climate change in the African Union and worked, amid great criticism from fellow African presidents, to bring African policy in line with Europe \u2013 again to be rewarded by fast-track financing from Europe.</p> <p>Zenawi was born in Adwa, Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, the son of an Ethiopian father and Eritrean mother. In his 20s, he rebelled against the Stalinist dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam while a medical student at the then Haile Selassie University, Addis Ababa, and in 1975 joined the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. He became head of its leadership committee in 1979, and of its executive committee by 1983.</p> <p>In 1991, in alliance with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, led by Isaias Afewerki, the rebel forces swept aside the armies of Mengistu, and Meles became president of Ethiopia. He also became chair of the EPRDF, and in 1993 agreed to what seemed an amicable agreement for Eritrea to leave Ethiopia as its own independent state. But years of tension and war between the two countries were to follow. The conflict was at its bloodiest from 1998 to 2000, but the settlement of the border dispute has only ever allowed an uneasy peace.</p> <p>Meles drove Ethiopia forward with a huge range of reforms and global links. He himself, throughout the early years, found time to devote himself to study, obtaining an MBA from the Open University in 1995 and an MSc in economics from Rotterdam in 2004 \u2013 both universities sending tutors to Ethiopia to educate not only Meles but a large number of the new ruling elite.</p> <p>At the first general elections of 1995, Meles became prime minister and the EPRDF the dominant political party. He and the party were re-elected every five years subsequently. Under their government, Ethiopia has seen a dramatic lowering of infant mortality and a huge growth in education \u2013 literacy rates rose from 50% in 1997 to 65% in 2002. There has been economic growth of up to 9% per year in most of the years of the new millennium. The country has seen a huge building and housing boom. Meanwhile, controversial land-ownership policies have facilitated the agri-industry.</p> <p>The actual workings of the multi-party system have been controversial, with violence and accusations of fraud marring elections. Meles's foreign policy, while asserting Ethiopia's importance in the region and the world beyond, has had problematic consequences.</p> <p>Despite the controversies surrounding his policies, the positive elements in them were celebrated. Meles won the Norwegian Green Revolution prize, and awards for lifting much of Ethiopia out of poverty and hunger. Under his rule, Ethiopia doubled its food production.</p> <p>Perhaps the iron man who is nevertheless \"modern\", who leaves a genuine developmental legacy while making life hard for his opposition, who seeks to please the west while cementing his country's own regional interests is a necessary step on the path of African growth. Meles was pragmatic when it came to contemplating the world around him and around Africa.</p> <p>The beautiful and grand new headquarters of the African Union, opened in Addis Ababa in 2012, was financed, designed and built by Africa's new friend, China.</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, a son, Senay, and two daughters, Semhal and Marda.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Meles Zenawi, rebel leader and politician, born 8 May 1955; died 20 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>After Euro 2012 and the Olympics, the football season is already under way in many countries around the world. Sport seems to be everywhere but can, and should, we harness its power to achieve development aims? </p> <p>Football, cricket and a host of other sports are often used to raise awareness about issues such as HIV and gender equality, and sports stars have played a high-profile role in development, either by setting up foundations or through advocacy campaigns. But how much do such interventions achieve? Should sport be used as a means to an end, or is it a development goal in its own right? And although the world enjoyed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/aug/13/london-2012-bridged-divide\">the Olympic feats of Usain Bolt and David Rudisha at London 2012</a>, can the money and enthusiasm generated by hosting major sporting events promote long-term economic development?</p> <p><strong>Les Roopanarine</strong> gets the views of <strong>Tim Kellow</strong>, CEO of the <a href=\"http://www.craigbellamyfoundation.org/\">Craig Bellamy Foundation</a> in Sierra Leone; <strong>Scott Sandison</strong>, an athlete ambassador for <a href=\"http://www.righttoplay.com/International/Pages/Home.aspx\">Right to Play</a>, who describes how his organisation is using sport to make learning fun; <strong>Christoph Wilcke</strong>, of <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a>, who assesses whether <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/08/sarah-attar-saudi-arabia-olympics\">Saudi Arabia's first female Olympic athletes</a> can promote gender equality in the country; and <strong>Derrick Charway</strong>, who outlines how <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Beckwith-International-Leadership-Development-BILD-Ghana-Programme/170495916328778\">Ghana's Bild programme</a> is using sport to create a generation of young leaders.</p> <p>We hear too from journalist <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexduvalsmith\">Alex Duval Smith</a></strong>, in Cape Town, who reports on the development legacy of the 2010 football World Cup in South Africa. <strong>Andrew Zimbalist</strong>, an economist at Smith College in the US, explains why independent academic studies suggest sport has limited power to promote development, while <strong>Dr Simon Darnell</strong>, of Durham University, highlights the dangers inherent in uncritical acceptance of sport as a force for good.</p>",
  "<p>News that three foundation trusts in London look likely to merge slipped relatively under the radar last month \u2013 but if the plans go ahead, they will see the creation of the biggest hospital trust in England, with more than double the annual turnover of any other.</p> <p>A business plan is expected by the end of the year, but as it stands, the merging of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2011/jun/21/guys-and-st-thomas-hospital-nhs-foundation-trust-profile\">Guy's and St Thomas</a>', <a href=\"http://www.kch.nhs.uk/\">King's College hospital</a> and <a href=\"http://www.slam.nhs.uk/\">South London and Maudsley</a> looks set to be agreed by all three trusts and could be completed as early as 2014.</p> <p>The academic health sciences centre <a href=\"http://www.kingshealthpartners.org/\">King's Health Partners</a> \u2013 which manages a partnership between the three trusts and <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx\">King's College London</a> \u2013 set out the case for \"creating a single academic healthcare organisation\". The three trusts and university already work closely together, but the case put forward is that a full legal and financial merger would mean the new organisation \"could achieve more and at a greater pace, allowing King's Health Partners to respond to a changing world and the future needs of patients\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CFAQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kingshealthpartners.org%2Ffiles%2Fnews%2Fstrategic_outline_case_8235.7.12%2520FINAL.pdf&amp;ei=UZ8zUPrRF-eY1AX-t4CgBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmvgqY9__VKbEGv4hhIHfyFL3Kzg&amp;cad=rja\">case outlines</a> a vision for the organisation to be a global leader in improving health and wellbeing through, among much more, its close integration and physical and mental health services. The organisation is keen to emphasise that core local health services, such as A&amp;E and maternity units, should remain on multiple sites, but a significant point in plans for the merger is that combining certain other services would improve outcomes and best practice for others.</p> <p>The executive director of King's Health Partners and vice-principal at King's College London, Professor Sir Robert Lechler, said: \"There's no plans to phase anything out. Doesn't mean we won't, but there are no plans to ... but there may be some cases where we will consider consolidation.\"</p> <p>It is estimated by the organisation that the cost of putting the business plan forward would amount to 0.2% of annual turnover, although the financial cost of the full merger will not be calculated until the plan is produced. The merger, however, is apparently not motivated by cost.</p> <p>\"Unlike many mergers this discussion is not being driven by the need for financial savings, although this would be a significant benefit,\" says Lechler. \"An integrated organisation could achieve more at a greater pace and these benefits would translate directly into greater social value.\"</p> <p>Greater financial flexibility is a big pull, and Lechler sees this leading to \"greater gains in productivity then finances\".</p> <p>The trusts and university work closely together in clinical academic groups, or Cags. There are 21 Cags spilt into fields such as child health, psychosis and cardiovascular. In each Cag, specialist leaders, clinical services and university departments work together in streams to improve services, research and best practice in particular areas.</p> <p>However, Lechler explains that work can only go sor far when services do not share budgets, and legal restrictions on resources can be frustrating. He explains: \"As they've started to work together and get closer that's what's brought us to the point we're at now\".</p> <p>Lechler envisages this structure being adapted for the new organisation when it merges, breaking one huge trust down into \"mini trusts\" specialising in different areas such child health and cancer, and with \"devolved management structures\". He acknowledges the organisation will be in uncharted territory, but says it won't be \"a monster\".</p> <p>Yet could the sheer size of the proposed organisation do just that? The merger would not be possible before the health act \u2013 but the act is designed to create more competition. Will patient choice be compromised through the combining of three big London trusts?</p> <p>\"No,\" is Lechler's answer, \"not at all.\" He explains: \"If you think about anywhere else in the country other than London, you wouldn't think anything of having to drive 20 minutes to get to your hospital. Even if there's a slight loss of competition because you won't be able to chose between King's College hospitals or Guy's and St Thomas', you can perfectly well drive to Bromley, or Croydon, or Lewisham. The travel time outside London would probably be less than what many people have to travel to their local hospital. So there's plenty of opportunity for alternatives.\"</p> <p>Integration and wellbeing are big buzzwords, but why are the organisations merging when a lot of work could surely be tackled through cultural, as opposed to structural, changes?</p> <p>\"It's such an absolute no-brainer, because we now know 30% of our patients with rheumatoid arthritis are depressed and that rheumatologists, for all their talents, aren't the best at picking that up or managing it. Sixty percent of patients referred to a cardiologist with chest pain have nothing wrong with their heart. And that schizophrenia shortens your life by something like 17 years \u2013 it's worse than lung cancer. And nowhere in the world is addressing that.</p> <p>\"We are for the first time in years creating a logical landscape for healthcare\".</p> <p>This all hinges, Lechler says, on the business case. \"If the business case says 'we can't deliver QIPP' then we won't do it. If it says 'this allows us to become more productive, efficient, and release money for investment in improving services', then we should.\"</p> <p><em>We will be including the transcript of the interview with Professor Sir Robert Lechler in our weekly healthcare email this week, which gets sent out every Wednesday.

  "<p>While I've enjoyed cooking and baking cakes for as long as I can remember, my main passion growing up was always drawing and painting. From a young age I enjoyed nothing more than visiting art galleries, which usually inspired me to get stuck into my own art projects at home. At school, when it came to making our subject choices for university, the decision was easy \u2013 art college was the only place I could see myself studying.</p> <h2>Getting inspired for edible art</h2> <p>During my art college degree, I had the opportunity to explore the world of painting in greater depth. My artworks were always colourful and the subject matter was usually something quite wacky. My paintings also became a lot more three-dimensional.</p> <p>I worked a lot with wood and cardboard and soon my art was taking up entire walls. However, while I loved creating a spectacle, the size of the paintings also came to be a burden; the bigger my paintings, the harder it was to find a place to store them after the exhibition.</p> <p>This was when the idea of 'edible art' first came to mind. I was intrigued by the notion that I could spend weeks building an artwork to go on display in an exhibition, only for it to be eaten by gallery visitors within the space of a couple of hours.</p> <h2>Developing skills and techniques for sculpture</h2> <p>I organised my first cake exhibition in my third year of art college. I had been travelling around Turkey the summer before and wanted to build a series of cakes inspired by the spectacular architecture I had seen.</p> <p>I spent a couple of months before the show experimenting with different types of icing and cake decorating tools, and working to find the ingredients to make the perfect sponge cake. I also went to cake decorating classes and cake conventions in order to get some inspiration from other baking enthusiasts.</p> <p>My exhibition turned out to be a wonderful experience \u2013 there was a huge turnout (there was free cake after all) and the response was really positive. This encouraged me to work even bigger and design cakes for people who might not necessarily visit art galleries.</p> <p>Over the next two years, I made a couple's fantasy wedding cake, an eight feet tall 'walk in' birthday cake and I was even commissioned by the Edinburgh City Council to make a giant Christmas-themed cake for the city's biggest department store.</p> <h2>Turning a showpiece exhibition into a career</h2> <p>The press attention I received for <a href=\"http://www.connieviney.com/\" title=\"\">my cake sculptures</a> was overwhelming. However, nothing could have prepared me for the response I got from my art college degree showpiece \u2013 a room made entirely out of icing. Everywhere you turned there was something either weird and wonderful or dark and disturbing carved out of icing \u2013 I wanted it to be visually mesmerising.</p> <p>Images of the sugar room were featured in newspapers around the world and busloads of school kids came to the degree show just to see my piece. This response showed me that there may be a market for outlandish cake design and I began to consider the possibility of developing a career out of it.</p> <h2>Starting a career after graduation</h2> <p>It was a daunting prospect at first; I'd never imagined myself as a businesswoman! After graduating (with an MA in Fine Art and Art History from Edinburgh University) I decided to move to London and, almost straight away, booked a gallery space in one of the city's main contemporary art districts, Vyner Street.</p> <p>This presented a new and exciting challenge and gave me something solid to work towards. Of course, the only issue was money so I got a job as a full-time waitress, which just about covered my rent. Obviously, this wasn't in the field I'd spent the last six years studying in, but I actually quite enjoyed my job and got a buzz from working in such a high pressure environment.</p> <h2>Getting corporate sponsorship</h2> <p>The world of cake making is a pricey business, and the money I made from waitressing wasn't enough to cover the cake creations I had in mind. I managed to get some funding from the <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil-ni.org/\" title=\"\">Northern Ireland Arts Council</a>, but this was pretty minimal; as everyone knows, times are hard, and I've seen how funding for the arts has been drastically cut over the last couple of years.</p> <p>I then decided to email the <a href=\"http://www.silverspoon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Silver Spoon</a> sugar company and asked if they would like to sponsor my exhibition. I wasn't even expecting a response but they wrote back immediately and were really positive about the prospect of working with me. We had a meeting in London, and I told them how much icing I would need for my exhibition \u2013 which was a lot \u2013 and before I knew it, a truck full of icing had arrived at my door and I was unloading it into my hallway.</p> <p>I know some artists are a bit sceptical about being sponsored by big businesses because they can make certain demands that aren't in line with how the artists want their work to be presented. The best thing to do is to keep your eyes open and see a sponsorship deal as just one of the steps in the journey towards getting to where you want to be.</p> <p>For me, Silver Spoon have been really supportive and honest about what they would like to gain from working with me, which is essentially publicity for their brand. They understand that it's an art exhibition first and foremost, and that I want my artistic intentions to remain central to the overall project. It just so happens their brand of icing is the one I chose to make my sugar sculptures with.</p> <p>I've found that sponsorship to be a saving grace, as it has enabled me to work on a scale I'd previously only fantasised about. The additional press exposure my exhibition could receive is something I really value, especially at this early stage in my business. Also, depending on how this exhibition goes, there may be a possibility with working with them in the future.</p> <p>Where my business is concerned, things seem to be going from strength to strength. My aim for the future is to carry on having exhibitions in art galleries alongside working on commissions for large events \u2013 both areas undoubtedly have their attractions and drawbacks, especially where money is concerned. Either way, the prospect of earning a living from making people's fantasy cakes and art is something that really excites me.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published by </em><a href=\"http://www.creative-choices.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Creative Choices</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.connieviney.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Connie Viney's</em></a><em> latest exhibition will be at </em><a href=\"http://www.vynerstreetgallery.co.uk/ComingUp.html#comingup\" title=\"\"><em>Vyner Street Gallery</em></a><em> from 3 - 9 September 2012 \u2013 follow her on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thatconnieone\" title=\"\"><em>@ThatConnieOne</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Kate Bull is aptly named. She is, in the nicest possible way \u2013 bullish: determined, opinionated and single-minded. Which, when you're challenging the status quo of one of the largest industries in the country, is undoubtedly the best way to be.</p> <p>After a career in conventional retail, including spells at Marks and Spencer and running her own consultancy, Bull was determined to do things differently. In early 2010, she hooked up with two sympathisers, celebrity eco-chef Arthur Potts Dawson and regeneration specialist David Barrie, and <a href=\"http://www.thepeoplessupermarket.org/\" title=\"\">The People's Supermarket</a> [TPS] was born.</p> <p>Her retail savvy shows in TPS's choice of site. It sits in London's smartly bohemian Lamb's Conduit Street, well placed to draw passing trade from Great Ormond Street hospital staff, lawyers from nearby Chancery Lane and Gray's Inn, lunchtime shoppers exploring the various vintage shops and wine bars, and the area's large student population.</p> <p>I meet her in the basement lounge-office surrounded by sample products, papers and stock. Bull sports her branded TPS yellow t-shirt and offers me croissants with nectarine compote. These have been made by TPS's People's Kitchen chefs, who cook up beautifully-smelling food on the shop floor, with compote courtesy of one of their many local cottage-industry suppliers. There's a deliberately neighbourly feel to the place, reflecting Bull's optimistic vision of a new form of community co-op which brings shoppers, traders and local food producers together in a style more akin to a community centre than a supermarket. As if on cue, a mum and her daughters arrive and register eagerly in the weekend's bake-off competition \u2013 a fundraiser for Amnesty International, suggested by Bull's 14-year-old daughter for their second anniversary.</p> <p>As a business model, TPS is definitely one of a kind. Neither traditional co-op, nor typical wholefood store, it was quite a leap of faith opening on the back of just \u00a350,000 in start-up capital \u2013 compared to around \u00a3500,000 - \u00a3750,000 minimum for a 'normal' store. This was boosted by a \u00a3130,000 loan from <a href=\"http://www.walltowall.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wall to Wall TV</a>, which made a documentary about the first year of the store, to secure the lease. A grant from the <a href=\"http://esmeefairbairn.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Esmee Fairbairn Foundation</a> (\u00a355,000 a year for two years) covered Bull's salary, although she reinvested most of this in the business.</p> <p>Everything else required \u2013 materials, furniture, legal advice and, above all, labour, together amounting to around \u00a3600,000 worth \u2013 was donated free of charge. At the heart of the business model is the membership scheme \u2013 currently 750-strong. Members pay \u00a325 a year for the privilege of putting in four hours work a month, receiving a 20% discount on their purchases in return \u2013 along with some training. Membership conveys \"rights, roles and responsibilities\", Bull explains, including the right to vote \"on everything \u2013 salaries, suppliers, products, management.\" There are no individual liquid returns. But the combination of job skills and a sense of enthusiastic community seem more than enough by compensation.</p> <p>Indeed, members recently voted to change their legal structure from a traditional co-op to a Community Benefit Society, which ensures that any dividends will be returned to community projects chosen by members themselves. \"There will be no fat cats!\" says Bull. Instead, \"we could buy a greenhouse for the nearby <a href=\"http://www.calthorpeproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Calthorpe gardening project</a> which supplies us with our salads, to help extend their season.\"</p> <p>A huge pool of voluntary workers keeps staff overheads to a minimum. There are just 17 on the payroll, all of whom are paid the minimum wage. That's an awful lot of free, or at the very least cheap, labour. But Bell counters accusations of exploitation by insisting that TPS is helping people transform their lives with the skills they've learnt. It's certainly no picnic working with members who are largely untrained in retail, change shifts every four hours and are juggling all sorts of other responsibilities. On the day I visited, members working included an international student, a High Court judge and someone who is long-term unemployed.</p> <p>If the business model is distinctive, so is the store itself. It's part normal shop, part eco-store (so Fairy washing-up liquid and tins of Whiskas stand side-by-side with Ecover and organic cat food). \"We don't judge\", says Bull, \"but we do give choices.</p> <p>\"I personally may believe Coca-Cola, for instance, is one of the most dangerous products out there\", says Bull. \"But it's one of our top 10 lines. If we didn't sell it, we wouldn't have a business. But we always offer an alternative \u2013 we also sell <a href=\"http://www.ubuntucola.org/\" title=\"\">Ubuntu</a> [Fairtrade] cola. There's actually nothing we won't sell except cheap beer and alcopops. But cheap beer has no profit margin anyway, so why would we?\"</p> <p>They discriminate in favour of locally grown, seasonal fruit and veg, but will import if they have to. \"We try to give customers a choice of three \u2013 a cheap option, a recognised brand and what we call a 'brand with values'\". This might be something organic, or locally produced, or having fewer additives. With honey, for instance, you could buy a jar of 'Frank's Honey', which a member brings in from his garden in the suburbs.</p> <p>They do, however, trumpet their success at turning any wilting fruit and veg into tasty meals in their People's Kitchen, which are then sold in the shop. \"We also get vegetables donated from New Covent Garden [wholesale market] that might otherwise be dumped \u2013 it happened this week with three large boxes of perfect green tomatoes from Mexico that were no longer wanted. We made them into lasagne and chutneys in recycled jars. What a saving of all those global resources!\" This year they calculate they saved three tonnes of waste from landfill and created 20,000 meals using surplus fruit and veg.</p> <p>So is it a standard bearer of a retail revolution? Innovations charity <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NESTA</a> seems to think so. Mark Griffiths from its Public Services Lab applauds its \"moral purpose with commercial acumen\", and highlights its \"new forms of volunteering, new ways of organising, new ways of minimising the wastage of food\u2026\"</p> <p>Retail analyst Neil Saunders of agency <a href=\"http://conlumino.com/\" title=\"\">Conlumino</a> agrees: \"There is a backlash against the Big Four supermarkets, and this is a community-based, sustainable way of addressing the issues people don't like.\" But, he cautions that \"it does occupy a distinct niche. It has limited scope in terms of rolling out as a mainstream proposition. It's not everyone's cup of tea and doesn't fit the image of a supermarket that many people are used to.\"</p> <p>Talking to Bull on the supermarket's second birthday, she agrees it's been a roller coaster ride. The lowest point was when she talked Camden Council's bailiffs out of closing them down, when they couldn't pay their business rates this February. She negotiated staged payments over a cup of tea on their donated leather sofas and kept the doors open.</p> <p>It sounds precarious, but TPS's distinct appeal helped it raise \u00a37,000 in a week's worth of digital fundraising \u2013 with donations coming in from across the globe. Even so, it took The Fredericks Foundation to step up with a \u00a320,000 loan hours before the supermarket was going to shut.</p> <p>It was a close call which helped focus members' minds on choosing products that increase footfall or have larger profit margins. One result was a recent vote to start selling cigarettes, which Bull describes as \"the most heated argument members have ever had\". Other plans include starting an external caterers and setting up local market stalls, both as extra income streams and to promote the shop.</p> <p>There is a clear sense from everyone involved that failure is not an option. Sales, at least, are pointing the right way. In the year 2011/12, takings rose by 53%. And as Bull points out, \"In two years we've created a business with \u00a31.2m turnover from zero, with gross profits of \u00a3368,000. We started with no cash and we've never had an overdraft\u2026 This year we have a loss of \u00a392,000 after overheads, but I think next year we'll make a surplus.\"</p> <p>And the story does seem to have struck a chord. Fourteen groups in the UK are interested in setting up their own version, and Bull hopes to see them take root as franchises \"on an open source model\" \u2013 using the TPS's name and values, but without the original shop benefiting financially.</p> <p>She may have time to help realise this after she stands down as CEO, a move planned for this summer \u2013 \"this is a community, not a vehicle for any one person's ego\", she says, although the chances are she will be offered the position of Chair.</p> <p>Can she ever imagine going back to mainstream retail? I don't expect her to say yes, but she does. \"Possibly. I love it. But only if they allowed me to challenge things. I didn't like the way retail was going and I could have spent my life moaning. But [if you want change], sometimes you just have to get on and do it.\"</p> <p><em>Sue Wheat is a freelance journalist</em></p>",
  "<p>We tend to think of them as old-fashioned throwbacks to a bygone era, but in political circles Britain's seaside resorts are more important than ever.

According to a recent Deloitte study for Visit Britain, <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/thl/f9590b98fc001210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm\" title=\"\">The Economic Contribution of the Visitor Economy</a>, the UK's tourism industry was worth \u00a3115.4bn in 2009, equivalent to 8.9% of UK GDP. Tourism contributes \u00a396.7bn to the economy in England (8.6% of GDP), \u00a311.1bn in Scotland (10.4%), \u00a36.2bn in Wales (13.3%) and \u00a31.5bn in Northern Ireland (4.9%).</p> <p>The Deloitte study found that the number of jobs that tourism supports is forecast to increase by 250,000 between 2010 and 2020, from 2.645 million to 2.899 million and that one in 12 jobs in the UK is currently either directly or indirectly supported by tourism.</p> <p>However, the decline in Britons spending their main holiday, or indeed any holiday, at the seaside is one factor that has led to a crisis affecting many resorts, even as the tourism market grows. Many are in urgent need of the lifeboat.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35102.htm\" title=\"\">parliamentary report on coastal towns</a> argued that the government has no specific policy or initiatives, based upon the premise that they are too diverse to warrant such an approach. The report highlighted that resorts suffered from physical isolation, deprivation, the inward migration of older people, high levels of transience, the outward migration of young people, poor-quality housing and the nature of the coastal economy. The report said: \"Excluding their physical location, none of these characteristics are unique to coastal towns. The combination of these characteristics, however, with the environmental challenges that coastal towns face, does lead to a conclusion that they are in need of focused, specific government attention.\"</p> <p>The majority of <a href=\"http://www.coastalcommunities.co.uk/regeneration-handbook/english-seaside-towns-past-present-and-future\" title=\"\">seaside resorts</a> are essentially one-industry towns, relying on tourism, and competing against an ever-growing and better-priced alternative overseas. They are usually, by definition, in peripheral locations with what have been described as \"180-degree economies\". Tourism is also seasonal and is notorious for providing low-paid, low-skilled and low-status jobs. Of the businesses that do survive, many are national chains of pubs, hotels and shops rather than independent local entrepreneurs. Tourist spending is thus hardly guaranteed to remain in the local economy, although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/totnes-war-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">some towns have been fighting the trend</a>.</p> <p>Many seaside towns have relatively large dependent populations who create additional demands on health and social services. Former holiday accommodation has frequently been converted into DSS housing and, more recently, hostels for refugees and asylum seekers. Unemployment in seaside resorts is often comparable to inner-city areas, reaching, for example, more than 15% in Blackpool in the winter months. Economic decline has too often led to a crumbling local infrastructure, part of a vicious circle that makes these towns even less desirable places to visit.</p> <p>Conservative policy is to cut \"red tape\" and regulation which, they argue, harms local businesses. They have abolished regional development agencies and transferred funding and resources to local councils. This should represent a golden opportunity for the Labour opposition. Many policies close to Labour's heart, such as the minimum wage, the working time directive and improved education and training, are more relevant to the tourism industry than almost any other. Even <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2085781\" title=\"\">Eric Pickles</a> seems to understand this.</p> <p>It should not be forgotten that it was a Labour government that introduced the right to paid holiday for the first time. And it was the last Labour government that brought in a scheme to boost regeneration in coastal areas through investment in culture and heritage. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) introduced <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/sea-change/about\" title=\"\">Sea Change</a> to ensure that investment in cultural projects complements and enhances wider regeneration programmes.</p> <p>Diversification is absolutely crucial for seaside resorts that can no longer rely on the traditional bucket and spade holidays. Although tourism can be the catalyst for regeneration, it is not the only, or even prime, solution in every instance. The illuminations in Blackpool have been extending the season for more than 70 years. Bournemouth and Brighton are excellent examples of seaside towns that have successfully repositioned themselves as venues for conferences, exhibitions and trade fairs. There are also opportunities to develop as heritage centres, bases to visit nearby attractions or any other number of niche markets.</p> <p>The European Union, too, could have a role to play in addressing the problems facing our seaside towns. A number of resorts are located within the EU's objective one and two, and now objective three areas, and benefit from European funding.</p> <p>Seaside resorts across the UK are in the frontline in the battle to win the next election. Labour has an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of well thought-out social and economic policies and even, perhaps, positive engagement with the EU. If it can do this, it may win the election. And, you never know, Blackpool may suddenly seem like a good choice of conference venue once again.</p>",

  "<p>As technology leaps forward, we find it integrating in every aspect of our lives. New behaviours form and become insidious to the point where service providers need to run to catch up with the changing expectations of their customers.</p> <p>The influx of technological access to services, and retail in particular, has opened many doors: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network-partner-zone-ebay/image-recognition-technology-retail-sales\" title=\"\">channels for convenient purchasing</a>, direct contact with a range of customers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/jul/25/social-retailing\" title=\"\">through social media</a>, and directed advertising. However, we cannot forget the importance of the classic jaunt of shopping on the high street \u2013 it is social, advisory and at a point where we need it more than ever.</p> <p>What is the appeal that still remains for physically shopping on the high street? Economics aside, there is still real demand for competing against the delayed gratification of online retail \u2013 it's there, in your hand and in your elegant bag; it's advised by attractive people who know their stuff and is augmented by spaces and places, large and illuminated.</p> <p>A key differentiator of this experience \u2013 and it is experiential by nature \u2013 is customer service: face-to-face interactions, advice and support in a branded environment that customers identify with. Tech is sexy, intuitive, and distinct, but it's also there to augment the customer's experience, not to eclipse it.</p> <p>For <a href=\"http://www.enginegroup.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Engine Service Design</a>, work that we traditionally do in the retail sector is service re-design: improving the customer experience. Driven by need, it meets the needs of retailers to keep up with customers and their expectations and the need of customers for their services to react to how they're behaving.</p> <p>Once needs are identified they can be met, and this often includes designing concepts supported by tech. The key point here though is the difference between displaying a technological asset and providing a technological solution. The challenge is to avoid just having an asset that looks good and masks an average service or experience \u2013 to develop a strong service system needs a customer-centric approach. It is then that technology solutions can be used most effectively for the experience as a whole: fully integrated and not outdating quickly.</p> <p>Engine were lucky to be involved with such a project \u2013 a juicy piece of business modelling and vision creation with an established but forward-thinking organisation. Philips Lighting had spotted the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_economy\" title=\"\">product to service shift</a>, and established a new ventures team, Philips Retail Solutions (<a href=\"http://www.retailsolutions.philips.com/\" title=\"\">PRS</a>), to explore options of service provision in retail.</p> <p>For Philips, their motivation was both the needs of customers and the capability of their technology products. They had developed the innovative hardware and software to create multi-sensorial and interactive in-store experiences and identified a market opportunity in the retail industry to create distinctive, branded experiences. Acting as a consultancy to retail clients, their aim was to provide solutions for clients who provided solutions for customers.</p> <p>Engine's involvement was to support Philips to define the new service: including the business model, value propositions, concepts and the platform to manage the service.</p> <p>We undertook research with interaction and retail designers, store, sales and retail managers, drawing out insights from the industry \u2013 the sector's evolutionary nature and the value of delivering multi-channel experiences. Similarly, we explored some of the barriers to change and the necessity of small pilots to demonstrate results.</p> <p>When designing the business offer, we used customer insights, brand values and business goals to create principles that define the user experience across all channels. These principles also make up the distinct offer of PRS and what needs they help their clients to meet \u2013 simplifying in-store management, aligning business targets and managing their resources; learning from them and evolving experiences. One of the key selling points of the offer was its measurability and built-in analysis tools \u2013 multi-sensorial is one thing but measuring the reactions of your customers to it is one step more; providing data on reactions and purchase behaviour for individual items, ranges, seasons and stores as a whole.</p> <p>As part of the delivery of the project, we developed the story of a PRS pilot project for a mobile operator as part of a range of communications to support the new venture. T-Mobile saw the benefit of attracting customers to their products through customer interaction that resonated with the products themselves: interactive and explorable. PRS created a set of interactive window displays called 'digits', which reacted to the movements of customers passing by and invited further engagement and exploration with individual digits serving as product displays in-store.</p> <p>It is examples like this, and <a href=\"http://www.retailsolutions.philips.com/index.html\" title=\"\">the work that PRS has gone on to do</a>, that demonstrate the success of a user-centred process that happily meets the client and customer needs and also provides a stage for the exciting capabilities that technology can provide to deliver powerful and distinct experiences.</p> <p><em>Julie McManus is knowledge manager at </em><a href=\"http://www.enginegroup.co.uk/site/\" title=\"\"><em>Engine Service Design</em></a><em> \u2013 follow the organisation on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hereatEngine\" title=\"\"><em>@hereatEngine</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

Asked on Monday night whether he thought there was any chance the British authorities would carry out its threat, the BBC reported that the president said: \"While the United Kingdom hasn't retracted or apologised, the danger still exists.\"</p> <p>Assange has been in the embassy in Knightsbridge since mid-June, and, despite Quito's offer, cannot leave for the airport as Britain is refusing to give him safe passage. The interview with Correa opened with a brief report from inside the embassy, showing the 41-year-old Assange embracing his lawyer Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, minutes before he addressed supporters from the balcony outside on Sunday.</p> <p>Speaking in advance of a meeting of the Organisation of American States on Friday, Correa said he hoped the gathering would provide him with strong backing from regional allies.</p> <p>\"Remember that David beat Goliath. And with many Davids it's easier to bring down a number of Goliaths,\" he said. \"So we're hoping for clear and coherent backing because this violates all inter-American law, all international law, the Vienna convention and all diplomatic traditions of the last, at least, 300 years on a global scale.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's been predicted that up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/29/budget-job-losses-unemployment-austerity\">500,000 public sector jobs could be cut by the end of 2015</a>. This has led to an unprecedented number of public sector workers trying to make the difficult move into the private sector. This transition can be extremely challenging due to the different working environments between commercially-driven organisations and public sector institutions.</p> <p>Candidates need to completely change their mindset in terms of embracing a new workplace culture when making a successful move to the private sector. The private sector is primarily focused on being profit driven and is free from many of the bureaucratic restrictions in the public sector. In a private sector, however, employees' main objectives are focused around financial performance and productivity. </p> <p>Projects in the private sector tend to be faster moving so it's important to show prospective employers that you have the ability to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment. Public sector workers who may not used to this way of working could find this much more pressurised and stressful.</p> <p>However, if those wanting to transfer into the private sector plan their move strategically, it can result in a new and rewarding career with added benefits. Here are some tips to help you make the move.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>A focused and targeted approach is key</strong>. Before rewriting your CV it's important to understand what type of organisations you want to apply to, where you want to be located, what level you want to be working at and what your ideal position is.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Avoid using public sector terminology</strong>. To illustrate that you are capable of making a successful move into the private sector it's important to use the right language, which is measurably different between the private and public sector. Read job descriptions and person specifications carefully, comparing like-for-like jobs in the public sector so you can understand the different language used.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Maximise your time when speaking to recruiters</strong>. Ask them if they have a good understanding of public and private sector workers and enquire what experience they have of assisting candidates transitioning.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Social media must be part of your career development campaign</strong>. Embrace social media and ensure you are a proactive jobseeker. A <a href=\"http://recruiting.jobvite.com/resources/social-recruiting-survey.php\">recent Jobvite social networking study</a> reports that 93% of companies plan to use social recruiting; it's critical to familiarise yourself with these types of online resources.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Tailor your CV</strong>. Use genuine statistics or numbers to give examples of cost savings, productivity improvements, process improvements, reduction in waste or losses or improved customer services. This will all help to secure an interview in the private sector. It's important to break your CV down into skills, achievements and experience.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Customers are not necessarily the same as service users</strong>. In the private sector a company's customers are where their revenue (and your salary) comes from, regardless of if they are individuals or other companies. It's important to illustrate the level of your commercial awareness in this area.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Don't wait for the right advertisement</strong>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/15952516\">60% of jobs secured are never advertised</a>. Making a targeted speculative approach to organisations that you want to work for, can really pay off if you are tactical. Why do you want to work for that organisation? What value can you bring to the table? Why would you make a great fit with their existing team? These are just some of the key questions you need to ask when identifying companies you want to approach.</p> <p>While the differences between public and private sector workers may seem wide, in fact they have never been so close as a result of the public sector pursuing best value. For instance, HR strategies more typically associated with the private sector \u2013 such as those promoting efficiency or encouraging staff loyalty \u2013 have been widely adopted. Measures have also been introduced in the public sector that link individual performance with strategic objectives. The privatisation of many public services has also encouraged a more enterprising culture, which has required staff to exhibit much greater professional flexibility and adaptability.</p> <p>It's important for private sector companies and the public sector workers making the move into commercial organisations to note that these changes will result in an influx of talent to the private sector in areas such as:</p> <p>\u2022 Management of multi-million pound budgets and critical decision-making<br>\u2022 Identification and implementation of cost control and best-value initiatives<br>\u2022 Compliance with complex regulatory or legislative requirements<br>\u2022 Management and mitigation of risk<br>\u2022 Development of people and teams<br>\u2022 Management of complex, highly political stakeholder relationships<br>\u2022 Knowledge of how governmental organisations work and an in-depth understanding of their key requirements.</p> <p>Finally, forget the competition. While it may be a candidate-heavy market now, the reality is that if there are two or twenty applicants, you are still competing. Stop worrying about what the rest will write or say and focus on you and the value you can offer.</p> <p><em>Elizabeth Bacchus is a writer, a regular public speaker on the subject of career development, a career coach who has worked with individuals from a broad range of industry sectors and the founder of <a href=\"http://thesuccessfulcv.com/\">The Successful CV Company</a></em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>You walk in on that first day with some idea of the class, the classroom and the layout of the school. You're overdressed; for me, it was a grey suit with a red tie in a lame attempt to accentuate authority. Your one aim will be to show you're in complete control but deep down you are second guessing your every move and decision.</p> <p>I remember a teacher making a complimentary comment on my table arrangement and all I was thinking was: \"Is she taking the mick?\" You then hear a range a comments which either deeply patronise or scare you half to death. One teacher said I needed to be prepared for the worst year of my life. Just think, you are doing what you want to do, what you studied hard for during your PGCE or GTP and your reward: get ready for \"the worst year of your life\". Some teachers just love to share how horrible and emotionally draining their NQT year was, they expect you to feel the same as some sort of rites of passage but it really doesn't have to be that way.</p> <p>I've completed my NQT year and have managed to enjoy some success. But you need to find your own way through; you can read all the books about the NQT year but in reality your own methods and strategies will help you overcome some of the pitfalls books and your teacher training college may not have warned you about. Here are some of mine:</p> <p><strong>Observations: </strong>Everybody hates them, including me, but what is it that we actually hate about them? Some people say it is someone judging you, other say trying to read the faces of the observers throughout the lesson, but for most of us it's the grades. My advice? Let go of chasing grades and focus on the actual teaching.</p> <p>Once <a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/\">Ofsted</a> came along and gave me a 'good' for a lesson that had all the hallmarks of an 'outstanding' (according to its criteria) I suddenly realised just how subjective grades can be. For one person it's a 'good' for another it's a 'satisfactory'. Observers can generally justify giving a grade based on the criteria as it can be quite open to interpretation. To avoid being caught up in petty squabbles over what one child understood or didn't, try to gather as much quality teaching ideas as possible. Then implement them to the best of my ability and watch the observations grades take care of themselves. Some observations will be great and others may fall short of your expectations. The key is not to get overjoyed or depressed, keep improving and move on.</p> <p><strong>Other teachers:</strong> The one thing that has baffled me throughout my NQT has been the personalities I've come across. Having previously worked in the corporate environment, I thought the teaching industry would offer a refreshing change. I expected supportive and motherly treatment from all those around me (naive, I know). That was true to some extent, but every now and then you encounter competitive, political and sometimes ruthless teachers. Let's face it there is a hierarchy in teaching and some teachers just want to climb (I call them game players). NQTs can be useful pawns in school politics, so it's important to keep your wits about you.</p> <p>Take information from these teachers with a pinch of salt and try to be as independent as possible. If a game player offers some basic support that you don't really need, think twice before accepting. The next you'll hear could be how hard you're finding the year and how dependant you are on others.</p> <p><strong>Parents:</strong> The one thing that most scared me before I started my NQT year was having to deal with parents. What if a parent is annoyed with me for telling off their child? What if they find a mistake in the homework I've set? The truth is sometimes they love you and sometimes they don't. That usually has nothing to do with your personality or teaching style.</p> <p>What I've found to be useful is to treat parents like customers. Always make them feel welcome, be prepared to talk about their child if something comes up and, most importantly, smile. If you are happy then they can see that their child will be happy.</p> <p>Don't worry, I'm not ignoring the fact that some parents can cause scenes and will not be happy. In that instance, I've found it best to diffuse. Calm parents down by telling them you understand, take them away from the children so your authority is not undermined and speak in a low, calm voice.</p> <p>I also always ask parents to speak with me after school where I can control the environment. Also finish with the lines \"thank you for telling me\" or \"any time you need me come and talk with me.\" Parents, like the rest of us, need to feel they are not being ignored. A happy parent can be a valuable aid in the progress of that child. Get them onside and collaboratively you can achieve great things for the child, which is all that counts.</p> <p>Your NQT year can seem daunting but actually, it's important to know what to expect. I'm sure by the end of your NQT year you will be able to create your own set of tips. What's important is that you not only how to survive but to thrive.</p> <p><em>Nikesh Pandya is now a class teacher at a primary school in the London borough of Brent.<br></em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

Says Roost's <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Venues/Cass-Titcombe-reveals-details-of-new-Roost-chicken-restaurant\">Cass Titcombe</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's everybody's favourite dirty fast food, isn't it? So we thought we'd see if we could make it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/jul/04/theoriginalkentuckyfriedch\">better</a>. Whatever you call it, 'gourmet fast food', or just redoing these dishes with quality ingredients, without MSG, it's possible and, it seems to me, quite popular. My background's <a href=\"http://www.canteen.co.uk/\">Canteen</a> and we kind of went through the process with pies. You can make a really rubbish pie, so, OK, let's get a pie, do it as best we can and use really good quality ingredients. That seemed to strike a chord with people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That Roost involves one of Canteen's co-founders, while <a href=\"http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2011/11/10/behind-the-scenes-at-meat-liquor/\">Scott Collins</a>, the business brain behind <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Business/MeatLiquor-owners-look-to-expand-in-London-and-to-Brighton-Overseas-investors-show-interest\">MeatLiquor and MeatMarket</a>, is one half of <a href=\"http://wishbonebrixton.co.uk/\">Wishbone</a>, tells you all you need to know about the current trajectory of the British \"restaurant\" scene. Its brightest minds have no interest in ploughing their time and talent into the often thankless task of fine dining. Instead, both culturally and financially, they are excited by crowd-pleasing fast-casual concepts, given a new foodist spin. </p> <p>It's a win-win. You open with a relatively short menu, selling a product which everyone already knows and loves (McDonald's and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/may/31/kfc-colonel-sanders-autobiography\">KFC</a> have already done all the marketing for you), but you deliver a version of unusually high quality, at a still affordable price. \"People will always want to eat out,\" says Titcombe, whose Roost mains will all be priced under \u00a310, \"but how much they spend and how frequently they eat out is obviously changing.\"</p> <p>You can sniff at this, complain that these trendy places with their tattoos and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/@spitandroast\">Twitter patter</a> are the preserve of a metropolitan hipster clique, but that, wilfully, misses the point. The energy and ideas flourishing at the interface of street and fast food could, if it's not already happening, kick-start a much wider and deeper democratisation of good food than modern British cooking and its distribution network, the gastropub, ever did. </p> <p>I say this as someone who is tat-free, doesn't use Twitter and who lives in Manchester, not London. The only immediate problem (beyond whether places with <a href=\"http://www.london-eating.co.uk/40833.htm\">queues snaking into next week</a> can really be described as serving \"fast food\"), is how many junk foods there might be left to save. From <a href=\"http://www.pittcue.co.uk/welcome.html\">barbecue ribs</a> to <a href=\"http://www.eat.st/traders/trader.php?traderID=89\">mac 'n' cheese</a>, it seems any fattening American comfort foods that might translate, have been; so where next?</p> <p>I'm saying kebabs. All the ingredients are there. Britain loves a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/feb/08/the-diy-doner-kebab\">'bab</a>, yet, as a dish, we sorely <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2006/oct/06/food.foodanddrink\">neglect</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/may/15/killerkebabs\">abuse it</a>. At the same time, in <a href=\"http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/463869\">London's best</a> Turkish <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/restaurants/venue/2%3A1163/mangal-ocakbasi\">ocakbasi</a>, we have a ready reserve of skill and knowledge to call upon. I can smell it already: rare-breed meats, mutton and free-range chicken; fresh thick pitta breads, like well cushioned insoles; fantastic eastern Mediterranean salads; homemade garlic and smoky chilli sauces; proper layered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawarma\">shawarma</a>; long-marinated skewers being moved skilfully around a huge bed of glowing charcoal. And the kebab would partner perfectly with the currently obligatory list of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/mar/06/craft-beer-now-served-cool\">craft beers</a> - and why not?</p> <p>But you may have other ideas. Do you dream of the dosa eclipsing the burrito? Are you waiting (in vain, I suspect) for Britain's first next-level waffle house? Could five-star falafel fly? What fast food would you like to see given a fastidious food-nerd makeover?</p>",
  "<h2>Jenny Rossiter is the author of Nobler and better things: Octavia Hill's life and work</h2> <p><strong>A hand up rather than a hand out: </strong>She discouraged indiscriminate alms giving and treated all people with dignity. I agree that she failed to see the importance of local government's role in the provision of housing.</p> <p><strong>State involvement:</strong> Strangely, she had no problem with state involvement in the provision of open space for all, but she saw no role for government in providing housing.</p> <p><strong>Ethical investment: </strong>She did enable individuals to invest directly into providing decent housing for poor families. A sort of ethical investment in housing. Is this something that could be explored today?</p> <p><strong>What is important are the principles behind her approach:</strong> Human scale, personal contact with tenants and seeing housing as more than bricks and mortar. She was never going to be able to scale-up to respond to the appalling housing conditions and levels of poverty that prevailed. But her approach to housing management, social care, unemployment, open spaces, and the environment did provide some useful examples of what could be done, albeit on a small scale.</p> <p><strong>Tenant participation:</strong> She was perhaps one of the first to encourage tenant participation! Any cash surpluses that were generated on her houses (after investors had been paid their 5% return) were used to impove conditions. Tenants were asked how the money should best be spent.</p> <p><strong>Education: </strong>Octavia Hill was also very keen on providing educational opportunities for her tenants, especially for women. She was responsible for setting up vocational training as basic education classes.</p> <h2>Reena Mukherji is director of community charity the <a href=\"http://www.octaviafoundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Octavia Foundation</a></h2> <p><strong>Octavia Hill believed in personal contact and visiting her tenants: </strong>Arguably, this is what is needed today, so that we can build up personal relationships, create a sense of community and combat social isolation.</p> <p><strong>The small scale, individualistic approach works really well:</strong> No two people, or their experiences are the same. By providing an individualistic service and approach we can help build lasting solutions. Much of this thinking has been taken up by the current government, for example the approach with so called troubled families.</p> <p><strong>Octavia Hill was a pioneer of women in housing: </strong>But I wonder if she would think that the glass ceiling exists today for women in the housing profession and what she might have done to challenge this?</p> <h2>Sandra Skeete is executive director of housing at <a href=\"http://www.peabody.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Peabody</a></h2> <p><strong>Lasting lessons: </strong>Good housing management is underpinned by regular contact with residents and well-trained staff who have clear standards to deliver on.</p> <h2>Gillian Darley is the author of the biography 'Octavia Hill: A life'</h2> <p><strong>Do not follow blindly: </strong>Speaking at an official celebration of her achievements in 1898, she hoped that her colleagues would not \"follow blindly\" in her footsteps. \"New circumstances require various efforts, and it is the spirit, not the dead form that should be perpetuated.\"</p> <h2>Ben Cowell is deputy director for external affairs at the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Trust</a></h2> <p><strong>Open spaces: </strong>Octavia Hill was a campaigner for a cause, and made a very strong argument about the importance of retaining open spaces in an undeveloped state in order to enhance the lives of city dwellers. But I'm sure she would have recognised the need to make balanced decisions in the interests of the common good.</p> <p><strong>Housing need:</strong> There ought to be ways of increasing the supply of housing without encroaching too heavily on well-used open spaces. We may need to increase efforts to tackle the problem of empty houses, for example. We may also need more debate about the kind of housing that we will need in the future \u2013 it may or may not match our present-day ideas.</p> <h2>Colin Wiles is a <a href=\"http://www.wilesconsulting.co.uk/wiles_consulting/About_Colin_Wiles.html\" title=\"\">housing and planning consultant</a></h2> <p><strong>She was the product of a different age:</strong> A middle-class do-gooder who believed in the self-help principles of Samuel Smiles. She opposed subsidised council housing because it would create dependency, something that chimes with Ian Duncan Smith and most in the Conservative party. She had an enormous influence on housing management \u2013 but many would now see her methods as paternalistic and controlling.</p> <p><strong>Octavia Hill proposed a green belt around London in 1875:</strong> A move that would have been disastrous for the future prosperity, housing and health of the capital (Cricklewood would now be in the countryside if she'd had her way.) Let's also not forget that she helped to found the National Trust, a body that is now one of the key blockages to sensible planning and housing policies in this country. She dealt with the small scale and the personal \u2013 I doubt she would have been sympathetic to the bigger picture of housing need and supply.</p> <h2>David Wardle is owner of <a href=\"http://learning4housing.co.uk/aboutl4h.html\" title=\"\">learning4housing</a></h2> <p><strong>Her views were broadly 'Christian socialist': </strong>Although she was a severe opponent of any state intervention into housing. On one hand she was a pioneer, with progressive views about improving living conditions for working class families. However, I think that this needs to be looked at within the context of her extreme paternalistic approaches to housing management, many of which have continued and become established practice within the housing profession. Clearly, Hill was of her time, and we cannot transpose her actions into the present and make judgements on this basis, but there are certainly different aspects of her legacy, not all of which are positive.</p> <p><em>To view the full discussion, </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2012/aug/10/live-discussion-octavia-hill-social-housing-legacy\" title=\"\"><em>click here</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for more discussion, comment and analysis</strong></p>",

  "<p>There's a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NVCITN\" title=\"\">first class article</a> in Nature this week on the reasons Americans reject the science of climate change. It has wider implications for a lot of the ways in which we think and talk about rationality.</p> <p>The author, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NVCRGQ\" title=\"\">Dan Kahan</a>, is not a scientist but a professor of both law and psychology. He is attacking the position that people reject the science of climate change because they are too stupid and too irrational. The idea that people disagree with them only because they are stupid and irrational is probably the consensus among scientists, even if you can't call it the scientific consensus because there's too much evidence to show that it is wrong.</p> <p>Kahan cites <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NVDhgq\" title=\"\">some of his own research</a> to show that the members of the lay public who are most science literate, and the most proficient at technical reasoning, are also the most divided on climate change \u2013 in other words, the deniers of climate change are among the most scientifically literate members of the general population.</p> <p>This is not so much because they reckon they are smarter than the experts, but because they are able to pick the experts who agree with them: \"People with different values \u2026 individualists compared to egalitarians, for example \u2026 draw different inferences from the same evidence. Present them with a PhD scientist who is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, for example, and they will disagree on whether he really is an 'expert', depending on whether his view matches the dominant view of their cultural group.\"</p> <p>One explanation is that we have a problem of propaganda: the lobbyist's rule that for every PhD there is an equal and opposite PhD makes it easy for malevolent forces to blind the world with bullshit.</p> <p>Kahan, however, sees a rather more powerful explanation. \"Positions on climate change have come to signify the kind of person one is. People whose beliefs are at odds with those of the people with whom they share their basic cultural commitments risk being labelled as weird and obnoxious in the eyes of those on whom they depend for social and financial support.\"</p> <p>The result of these pressures are everywhere. It is not just your conclusions that your peer group influences but also your data. Both believers in and deniers of climate change find their positions vary with the most recent weather \u2013 but <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Rv3Akn\" title=\"\">they disagree, sincerely</a>, on what this weather has actually been.</p> <p>Personal experience is not infinitely malleable. Perhaps if there were anything we could do about the weather, our opinions of it would be modified by the effects we saw our actions having. But there isn't. The weather is uncontrollable and this is even more true of climate change. What you or I do as individuals makes no difference to global warming. Even what the whole of the UK does won't change much.</p> <p>The kind of changes in consumption needed to make a real difference to our carbon output would require multinational action at government level. But democratic governments act from perceived self-interest even more than individual voters do.</p> <p>Since their actions are consistently directed to an end, an economist could call them rational. Both voters and governments, in ignoring the very painful adjustments that would be needed to diminish climate change, are definitely working to a utility function. They want to minimise their own unpopularity and will see the world in ways that make their actions seem rational. In general the right has understood this better than the left (or do I say this because the misdeeds of the other side are so much more apparent?).</p> <p>Underlying all this confusion is the problem that we don't have a way of ranking rationalities, so that the word means something more to a moral agent than it does to an economist. There may be ways of fixing that and averting catastrophic global warming that don't make use of religious resources, but I can't think of any.</p> <p>It's important to this argument to understand that religious resources need not be theistic. All they need do is make manifest a higher rationality than self-interest. This isn't an argument about whether God exists, but about how human beings make up their minds and form their characters. Atheist states based around myth and ritual are not hard to find. Social Democratic Sweden struck me even at the time as a theocracy organised around the worship of itself, and the official ideology was atheist. That's a benevolent example but there are plenty of malevolent atheist regimes that could serve as unpleasant examples. One of the most chilling aspects to accounts of life in North Korea is the degree to which official propaganda appeals to altruism and bravery.</p> <p>What religious thought \u2013 and ritual \u2013 can supply is the two things absent from normative consumer liberalism. The first is a belief that the choice between ends is not arbitrary or wholly personal: that there are moral facts of the matter; that saving as much of humanity as possible is an obligation on all of us, and that this is actually true, and not just a matter of preference.</p> <p>The second is the kind of conformism, reinforced by all kinds of social ritual, large and small, which will enforce the social discipline needed to carry societies through some pretty ghastly changes. Let's face it, any adjustment to an ecologically sustainable standard of living is going to be a lot nastier than anything Greece is going through now. It will need considerable determination and solidarity.</p> <p>All of the elements necessary for this are in fact present in a rather disorganised way in the society we have now got. The basic mechanism of social conformism is not so much policing behaviour \u2013 that needs only outrage \u2013 but policing <em>emotion</em>: the kind of second-order enforcement of conformity where my failure to feel outrage becomes itself a matter for your outrage. There's plenty of that around today.</p> <p>Similarly, I don't think our society believes there are no moral facts. On the contrary it believes that it is a moral fact that choice is the highest moral value, and so that it is wrong to maintain that other moral truths exist. Perhaps this can function as a unifying and compulsory truth if enough people believe it. It's certainly no less mythical than the alternatives.</p> <p>Kahan ends his piece with a flight into pure fantasy: \"Overcoming this dilemma requires collective strategies to protect the quality of the science-communication environment from the pollution of divisive cultural meanings.\" But the whole thrust of the piece is that there is no science communication that takes place independent of culture. You're going to have to fix the culture, so that words like \"trust\" and \"sacrifice\" mean something, before the science can in fact be communicated.</p>",
  "<p>The great family grain stores in the small village of Mgwata, 40 miles west of Malawi's capital Lilongwe, stand less than half full. At this time of year, they should be bulging with enough maize to take a family well into January and beyond. Instead, the village of 300 subsistence farmers already knows that this year's \"lean\" season \u2013 the months before the main harvest \u2013 will be the worst in at least a decade.</p> <p>The country has surplus grain from previous years, but soaring fertiliser and food prices, following a 45% <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/25/malawians-counting-cost-economic-reform\" title=\"\">devaluation of the national currency, the kwacha</a>, combined with a collapse of cotton prices and perennially depressed tobacco prices, have all conspired to make life in the southern African country harder than ever for most people.</p> <p>Mgwata is not alone. Malawi is one of the world's least developed countries, ranking 171 out of 187 in the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/\" title=\"\">2011 UN Human Development Index</a>. Despite large amounts of aid, 75% of the population earn less than $2 a day and 1 million, or more than 10% of the population, regularly go short of food. \"2012 is already hard,\" says Patrick Kamzitu, a health officer in Nambuma district, in western Malawi. \"This is a return to the bad times. Many people fear for the next six months.\"</p> <p>But the Lilongwe government, donors such as the <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp-gears-food-relief-thousands-malawi\" title=\"\">UN's World Food Programme</a> (WFP), and international charities working in Malawi, report that the food gap is worst in the south of the country, where most villages already have empty grain stores. The latest official <a href=\"http://www.fews.net/docs/Publications/Malawi_FSOU_2012_07_Final.pdf\" title=\"\">post-harvest food security assessment</a>, published in July by the famine early warning systems network (Fewsnet), predicts \"significant food consumption gaps\" and \"crisis food insecurity conditions\" in a swath of the country around the second city, Blantyre. The shortages are expected to peak, affecting 1.6 million people, between December and March 2013, says WFP.</p> <p>\"The situation is very serious,\" says the WFP director, Abdoulaye Diop. \"Our field staff have observed that households in parts of the country have harvested almost nothing. Our first priority will be to make sure that vulnerable people have enough food to sustain themselves through this lean season. At the same time, we must invest in more long-term solutions.\"</p> <p>Last week WFP, working closely with Britain and other donors, appealed to the world for $48m in food aid for Malawi. Britain offered $4.5m. The move signalled Malawi's formal reinstatement as a favourite of international donors after Britain, the IMF and others abruptly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/jul/14/britain-suspends-aid-to-malawi\" title=\"\">withdrew all aid last year</a> following \"concerns\" about the human rights record of former president Bingu wa Mutharika \u2013 who died unexpectedly in April \u2013 as well as corruption and government accountability. International approval for the new president, Joyce Banda, <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-08-05/Hillary-Clinton-Africa-Malawi/56798716/1\" title=\"\">was formally restored last week</a> when the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, unexpectedly stopped in Lilongwe and announced a big expansion of US government investment in Malawian cattle breeding.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17982062\" title=\"\">the devaluation</a> insisted upon by donors, and agreed by Banda, as part of the new IMF aid package for Malawi is hurting ordinary people. Prices of fuel, transport and many basic imported items have risen by 50% in a few weeks. Fertiliser prices, which are heavily subsidised by the government, have risen steeply and the price of maize has risen from an average of about 50 Malawian kwacha ($0.18) a kilo to MWK75. \"They have removed tax on bread, salt and water so the price of bread has come down, but maize could go up to MWK100,\" says John Makina, Oxfam's Malawi director. \"If so, it will hurt a lot of people.\"</p> <p>Happily, Malawi's grain reserves \u2013 stored in vast silos outside Lilongwe \u2013 are brimming with 800,000 tonnes surplus from previous years, says Peter Mwanza, the minister of agriculture and food security. Launching a programme in Lilongwe this month to distribute livestock to villages in 28 hard-hit regions, he said he hoped the country would have enough to feed itself. \"Last year the government diversified into cotton, but it did not do well. So now we are trying with livestock. We cannot rely on the rains these days, or one crop like maize any more. The areas traditionally hit by drought in the south are the ones which have been hit the hardest again,\" he said.</p> <p>\"At the national level, there is food sufficiency,\" said Makina. \"The country has actually done well. But there are populations that do not have enough. The problem is not production but distribution. Every year there is a surplus at national level, but every year there are pockets of people where there is not enough.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies are optimistic that Malawi will not see a repeat of 2002, when the IMF \u2013 backed by donors including Britain and the EU \u2013 was widely accused of forcing Malawi to privatise its grain stocks, leaving the country unable to meet its emergency needs. The result was Malawi's worst food shortages in 30 years and thousands of deaths.</p> <p>\"I think there will be a good response to the situation,\" said Makina. \"It's coming at a time when Malawi has a new administration and everyone, including donors, wants to support it. In addition, the president has signed off reports and donors like the WFP are geared to respond.\"</p> <p>Charities, such as the Dublin-based Concern Worldwide, are using mobile phones in their response to the latest crisis. Ten years ago it was almost impossible to reach farmers in remote areas, but today the mobile phone is ubiquitous.</p> <p>\"In the next few months we will be able to directly text 800 farmers to give them the latest prices for maize, tobacco, cotton and other crops,\" said Manu Mwaipopo, assistant country director in Malawi. \"We will roll the programme out to 2,000 people next year. We hope we do everything from warning of pest outbreaks, to giving them access to market prices, helping them negotiate better deals with traders and improving the timing of getting their crops to market.\"</p>",
  "<p>As a charity funded entirely through public donations, it's incredibly important that <a href=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/\" title=\"\">Cancer Research UK</a> is able to account for where every single pound of money is spent and that we maximise the amount we put into life-saving cancer research. In the financial year 2011/12, we spent \u00a3332m on our annual cancer research activity.</p> <p>One of the most effective ways we have found to optimise funding resources is by carefully managing our resources and constantly reviewing and challenging what we do and the way we operate. In 2010 we moved our existing London-based staff that needed to remain in London into one single building, the Angel Building in Islington. Before that point, our staff occupied several different office buildings which had been used by the charities that formed Cancer Research UK some years before. While there were initial costs involved in moving, in the longer term the move has resulted in significant cost savings. We are saving 20% on future operating costs as well as reducing travel costs.</p> <p>The original plan was to relocate staff desktop computers and laptops to the new site. However, the move also presented us with an opportunity to implement a flexible working policy. This would allow staff the option to work from home, or on-location and not only promised to deliver further cost savings for Cancer Research UK, but deliver an array of other benefits.</p> <h2>The reasons behind the move to flexible working</h2> <p>Given the size of the charity and the breadth of our work, including fundraising and research which takes place across the UK, there are times when staff members are out of the office, in meetings or at training for example. We wanted to make sure that our space and equipment doesn't sit empty or unused. Therefore it made sense for us to consider scaling back the amount of IT equipment we needed to provide. Having discussed it internally we decided that we could comfortably operate with 70% of the desks and computers we had at the time, with no negative impact on the organisation.</p> <p>On top of this, although we had taken the step to consolidate our offices, it was still important we maintained a presence right across London to enable us to work closely with partners and other organisations such as leading universities, teaching hospitals, the <a href=\"http://www.crick.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Francis Crick Institute </a>and the government.</p> <p>Flexible working seemed to address this need perfectly, giving staff unrestricted access to their system files, everyday programmes and applications on the move, via any smartphone, tablet, laptop or PC.</p> <h2>How was it managed?</h2> <p>As part of the move, we wanted to upgrade our operating systems from Microsoft Windows XP to Windows 7, but were wary about the costs of upgrading our hardware to support such a switch. Therefore, we decided to move from a Windows-based client-server IT infrastructure to desktop virtualisation, essentially outsourcing 99% of our back-end IT equipment.</p> <p>The first major benefit this provided was that, with our datacentre being looked after by an external provider, we dramatically reduced the amount of physical space we needed to dedicate to IT infrastructure. We went from around 300 servers, a space the size of a basketball court, to a single corridor of just 10 cabinets.</p> <p>Using technology from Citrix, our staff in the Islington office now have access to everyday applications like Microsoft Office and the Adobe suite, as well as legacy applications such as donor systems and a clinical trials programme, all from a hosted virtual desktop running Windows 7, regardless of location.</p> <p>Only a few mobile staff, such as shop managers and clinicians, have retained their corporate laptops and the software development team has kept its traditional desktops.</p> <h2>Benefits of flexible working</h2> <p>This new way of working has opened up numerous windows of possibility. Staff can now hot-desk, work from home, or from wherever is most convenient for them on a particular day. In addition, it also means that we can make organisational changes without moving furniture and equipment and add staff without requiring additional space. Staff can re-organise quickly and easily into project teams, which historically took huge investment in time to achieve.</p> <p>Since moving to the Angel Building, flexible working has already seen space requirements cut by a ninth. We were able to scale back to two floors from two and a quarter and we are confident we can reduce our physical footprint further as more people choose to work flexibly, as enabled by Citrix technology.</p> <p>We always drive for efficiency in our operations to ensure we use our supporter's money as wisely as possible. For every pound donated, 80p is available to spend on our work to beat cancer.By consolidating our locations and adopting a flexible working environment, we have been able to channel more funds into what really matters: beating cancer.</p> <p><em>Jane Swindle, IS Customer Support Service Manager at Cancer Research UK, explains the motivations behind switching to a flexible working policy and the benefits generated as a result.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.
