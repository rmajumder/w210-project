given a century-old <strong>tuberculosis vaccine</strong> on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>Devised at France\u2019s legendary Pasteur Institute 100 years ago, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the world\u2019s oldest and most trusted immunisations. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe vaccinated the first participant this morning,\u201d Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. </p> \n  <p>Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don\u2019t really understand,\u201d TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. </p> \n  <p>Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,\u201d said Diacon. \u201cNo one actually really understands why it works.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,\u201d said Diacon. </p> \n  <p>The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town.

Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the <strong>United States</strong> into confrontation, Reuters reports. </p> \n  <p>The report, presented early last month by the ministry of state security to top Beijing leaders including president Xi Jinping, concluded that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, sources said.</p> \n  <p>As a result, Beijing faces a wave of anti-China sentiment led by the US in the aftermath of the pandemic and needs to be prepared in a worst-case scenario for armed confrontation between the two global powers, according to people familiar with the report\u2019s content, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. </p> \n  <p>The report was drawn up by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think tank affiliated with the ministry of state security, China\u2019s top intelligence body. </p> \n  <p>Reuters has not seen the briefing paper, but it was described by people who had direct knowledge of its findings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have relevant information,\u201d the

request for comment. </p> \n  <p>Reuters couldn\u2019t determine to what extent the stark assessment described in the paper reflects positions held by China\u2019s state leaders, and to what extent, if at all, it would influence policy. </p> \n  <p>But the presentation of the report shows how seriously Beijing takes the threat of a building backlash that could threaten what China sees as its strategic investments overseas and its view of its security standing. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45ed20c14567af2d7a4bab3fbcf5b9519edba2fa\"> \n   <img

The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future.</p> \n  <p>One of Macron\u2019s main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country\u2019s schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday.</p> \n  <p>In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday.

  "<p>The creator of the dystopian TV series Black Mirror has said a career of anticipating the worst meant he was better mentally prepared for the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Charlie Brooker\u2019s scripts for the science fiction anthology series imagine scenarios from algorithms deciding who people are forced to date, to children being implanted with tracking chips, and robotic killer dogs roaming the countryside.</p> <p>He told <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/\">the Radio Times</a> this had prepared him for an unprecedented global crisis of the magnitude of Covid-19. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve really always expected something like this to come along, I think maybe I\u2019m not going through quite the level of psychological adjustment as some other people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve spent years anticipating the worst, oddly, when the worst happens, you can stop worrying about that possibly happening because it has. So I\u2019m dealing with this on a personal level far better than I would have anticipated.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker said he was not working on another Black Mirror, which first aired on Channel 4 before being bought by Netflix, as he did not think there was the appetite for it in the current climate.</p> <p>But the writer said he was optimistic about the future. \u201cIf you look at what happens in classic dystopian fiction \u2013 where everyone turns on each other immediately \u2013 so far that hasn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s not to say it won\u2019t. But I pivoted quite early to an optimistic view that this is terrible but, at the end of it, there\u2019s a possibility that we\u2019ll have the stomach to realign society a little.</p> <p>\u201cIs this forcing our hands to address financial inequality and climate change? You hope that\u2019s the outcome, rather than that it makes psychotic strongman politicians more secure.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/22/charlie-brooker-to-return-to-bbc-with-lockdown-special-antiviral-wipe\">return to TV screens this month </a>with a special lockdown version of his weekly news review show Screenwipe, titled Antiviral Wipe. The BBC said the first show on 14 May would feature the regular characters Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) and Barry Shitpeas (Al Campbell), offering their \u201cown very special brand of in-depth reporting\u201d.</p> <p>A press release announcing the show in April said other contributors would also be involved, but that they could not be named as they \u201chaven\u2019t been told they\u2019re doing it yet, but have no good excuse not to\u201d.</p> <p>Brooker said: \u201cThe BBC asked me to supply a quote for the press release, which is what you\u2019re reading now.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker has been congratulated for producing work that with hindsight seems impressively prescient. As Germany entered lockdown in March, the contestants of the country\u2019s Big Brother were left unaware of what was happening in the outside world \u2013 drawing comparisons with Brooker\u2019s 2008 series Dead Set, about reality TV show contestants who emerge to find a zombie apocalypse.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, fuck it,\u201d tweeted Brooker when the parallels were pointed out. \u201cThis is happening so frequently I\u2019m just going to have to accept that I\u2019m a soothsayer or a mystic or whatever you want to call it.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWith that in mind, I will now make an optimistic prediction in the hope it also comes true: we\u2019ll come out the other side of the coronavirus crisis a more empathetic, altruistic, and globally conscious society.\u201d</p>",

  "<p> Meteorologists have confirmed a new UK record was set for the sunniest April, with an average 224.5 hours of sunshine, beating the previous record of 211.9 hours in April 2015.</p> <p>Along with all the sunshine, April was unusually dry as gardeners discovered when their lawns grew increasingly parched. Perhaps the big downpours in the last week of the month, especially in the southern half of England, came in the nick of time. Despite the rains, April was still dry overall. It was 40% below the norm across the UK, with many northern parts abnormally dry. Morpeth in Northumberland had its driest April in records going back 126 years. Those dry and sunny conditions were due to persistent high pressure over the UK, keeping rainclouds at bay.</p> <p>The month was also remarkably warm for the UK, with temperatures 1.7C above the norm, despite the chilly end to the month. This fits a striking warming trend in the UK\u2019s climate, with six Aprils since 2003 all in the top 10 warmest Aprils in temperature records that date back to 1884.</p>",
  "<p>There is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory, intelligence sources have told the Guardian, contradicting recent White House claims that there is growing proof this is how the pandemic began.</p> <p>The sources also insisted that a \u201c15-page dossier\u201d highlighted by the Australian Daily Telegraph which accused China of a deadly cover up was not culled from intelligence from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/history-of-5-eyes-explainer\">Five Eyes network</a>, an alliance between the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</p> <p>British and other Five Eyes agencies do believe that Beijing has not necessarily been open about how coronavirus initially spread in Wuhan at the turn of the year.

One told the Guardian they believed the information that appeared in the News Corp title was most likely to have originally come from the US: \u201cMy instinct is that it was a tool for building a counter-narrative and applying pressure to China. So it\u2019s the intent behind it that\u2019s most important. So possibly open source leads with a classification slapped on it.\u201d<br></p> <p>Downing Street said that the UK did not comment on intelligence matters \u2013 although British sources also said they did not recognise the dossier as based on classified information provided by the country\u2019s spy agencies.</p> <p>Downing Street said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but a No 10 spokesman said: \u201cClearly there are questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure we are better prepared for future global pandemics.\u201d</p> <p>Neil O\u2019Brien, a Conservative MP and secretary of the China Research Group, said that Beijing could help fend off speculation with greater transparency: \u201cIf their government were less secretive and authoritarian they would cooperate more and so potentially put to bed wilder ideas about the origins of the virus.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html\">the New York Times reported that White House officials</a>, led by deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, a former China reporter with the Wall Street Journal, pressed the US agencies to gather information that could support any lab theory.</p> <p>A report in the Washington Post two weeks later highlighted <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/14/state-department-cables-warned-safety-issues-wuhan-lab-studying-bat-coronaviruses/\">a leak of US diplomatic cables from 2018</a>, claiming that a site visit showed the WIV had insufficient appropriately trained technicians for the high security work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a32bc863a9669483f5a930fcd6ac861a8ae3c3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a32bc863a9669483f5a930fcd6ac861a8ae3c3e/0_314_4787_2872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Researchers in a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Hubei province, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Researchers in a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), Hubei province, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shepherd Hou/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lab itself says it is distressed by talk of leaks. <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/\">Scientific American re-edited an interview with the virologist </a><a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/\">Shi Zhengli</a> last week to address \u201cthe tenuous suggestion\u201d of the lab theory, and noted the \u201cgenetic sequence\u201d of Sars-CoV-2, the scholarly term for coronavirus, \u201cdoes not match any her lab had previously studied\u201d.</p> <p>Charles Parton, a former foreign office official and senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said: \u201cPeople pushing these sort of lines are doing everybody a disservice.</p> <p>\u201cIt will inevitably prompt a Chinese reaction at a time when there is a need for a proper scientific understanding of its causes, and, in the longer term, to work together to stop pandemics happening again.\u2019\u2019</p>",
  "<p>The government is using the coronavirus pandemic to transfer key public health duties from the NHS and other state bodies to the private sector without proper scrutiny, critics have warned.</p> <p>Doctors, campaign groups, academics and MPs raised the concerns about a \u201cpower grab\u201d after it emerged on Monday that Serco was in pole position to win a deal to supply 15,000 call-handlers for the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/contact-tracing-app-to-be-piloted-on-isle-of-wight-this-week-matt-hancock-says\">tracking and tracing operation</a>.</p> <p>They said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had \u201caccelerated\u201d the dismantling of state healthcare and that the duty to keep the public safe was being \u201coutsourced\u201d to the private sector.</p> <p>In recent weeks, ministers have used special powers to bypass normal tendering and award a string of contracts to private companies and management consultants without open competition.</p> <p>Deloitte, KPMG, Serco, Sodexo, Mitie, Boots and the US data mining group Palantir have secured taxpayer-funded commissions to manage Covid-19 drive-in testing centres, the purchasing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/london-nhs-nightingale-hospital-placed-on-standby\">the building </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/london-nhs-nightingale-hospital-placed-on-standby\">of Nightingale hospitals</a>.</p> <p>Now, the Guardian has seen a letter from the Department of Health to NHS trusts instructing them to stop buying any of their own PPE and ventilators.</p> <p>From Monday, procurement of a list of 16 items must be handled centrally. Many of the items on the list, such as PPE, are in high demand during the pandemic, while others including CT scanners, mobile X-ray machines and ultrasounds are high-value machines that are used more widely in hospitals.</p> <p>Centralising purchasing is likely to hand more responsibility to Deloitte. As well as co-ordinating Covid-19 test centres and logistics at three new \u201clighthouse\u201d laboratories created to process samples, the accounting and management consultancy giant secured a contract several weeks ago to advise central government on PPE purchases.</p> <p>The firm said it was providing operational support for the procurement process of PPE from existing and new manufacturers, but declined to comment further.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must not allow the current crisis to be used as cover to extend the creeping privatisation of the NHS,\u201d said Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe process for the management and purchase of medical supplies must be open, transparent and subject to full scrutiny. Deloitte\u2019s track record of delivering PPE to the frontline since this virus began is not one of success and taking more decision-making authority from NHS managers and local authorities shifts power further from the frontline.\u201d</p> <p>Tony O\u2019Sullivan, a retired paediatrician who co-chairs the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said this was a \u201cdangerous time\u201d for the NHS, and that the \u201cerror-ridden response\u201d from government had exposed a decade of underfunding.</p> <p>\u201cNow, rather than learning from those errors they are compounding them by centralising decision-making but outsourcing huge responsibility for the safety of the population to private companies,\u201d said O\u2019Sullivan.</p> <p>Allyson Pollock, the director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, said tasks including testing, contact tracing and purchasing should be handled through regional authorities rather than central government.</p> <p>\u201cWe are beginning to see the construction of parallel structures, having eviscerated the old ones,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is anything new, it just seems to be accelerated under Matt Hancock. These structures are completely divorced from local residents, local health services and local communities.\u201d</p> <p>Friday\u2019s letter, signed by two officials from the Department of Health and Social Care, says that from Monday key equipment will be purchased through a procurement team comprising hundreds of staff from the government\u2019s commercial function and other departments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Department of Health and Social Care letter\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p style=&quot; margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;&quot; &gt;&lt;a title=&quot;View C0423-Letter to Procurement Leads - Centralising Procurement of PPE Other Supplies_ 1 May-2 on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/459848689/C0423-Letter-to-Procurement-Leads-Centralising-Procurement-of-PPE-Other-Supplies-1-May-2#from_embed&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;C0423-Letter to Procurement...&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title=&quot;View The Guardian's profile on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/user/17081734/The-Guardian#from_embed&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; on Scribd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;scribd_iframe_embed&quot; title=&quot;C0423-Letter to Procurement Leads - Centralising Procurement of PPE Other Supplies_ 1 May-2&quot; src=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/embeds/459848689/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-MxsylxLUp7fibtBysqTo&quot; data-auto-height=&quot;true&quot; data-aspect-ratio=&quot;0.7080062794348508&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Global demand for equipment has been \u201cunprecedented\u201d, according to the letter, and it is therefore \u201cvital that the UK government procures items nationally, rather than individual NHS organisations compete with each other for the same supplies\u201d.</p> <p>Trusts are told to flag any purchases already in progress so that these can be taken over by the central team and put into a central pot. \u201cThe national team can help you to conclude the deal, reimburse you, and manage the products through the national stocks.\u201d</p> <p>In a separate email, sent from NHS England on Saturday, trusts have been instructed to carry out a daily stock check from the beginning of this week. They must report down to the nearest 100 their stores of 13 types of protective equipment, including gloves, aprons, masks, gowns and eye protection. The information is being gathered by Palantir, a data processing company co-founded by the Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel.</p> <p>The information will be used to distribute equipment to those trusts most in need, and in some cases move stock from one hospital to another.</p> <p>A purchasing manager, speaking anonymously, said hospitals were concerned they might be forced to hand over stock and then run out before it could be replaced. \u201cThe lead time on some of these orders is 90 days,\u201d said the manager. \u201cCentrally, there is nobody who is able to deliver things more quickly. What this is going to do is force people to hide what they\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis coronavirus pandemic is being used to privatise yet more of our NHS against the wishes of the public, and without transparency and accountability,\u201d said Cat Hobbs, director of campaign group We Own It. \u201cThis work should be done within the NHS. It shouldn\u2019t be outsourced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is not the time for a power grab,\u201d said the Labour MP Rosie Cooper, who sits on the health and social care committee, which is conducting an inquiry into the management of the outbreak. \u201cWhatever contracts are awarded they have got to have a sunset clause. Three months, six months, it has got to be shown to be cost effective for it to continue after a certain date,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Department of Health was contacted for comment.</p> <h2>Outsourcing</h2> <p><strong>Testing centres</strong></p> <p>Contracts to operate drive-through coronavirus testing centres were awarded under <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/procurement-policy-note-0120-responding-to-covid-19\">special pandemic rules</a> through a fast-track process without open competition. The contracts, the value of which has not been disclosed, were granted to accountants Deloitte, which is managing logistics at a national level. Deloitte then appointed outsourcing specialists Serco, Mitie, G4S and Sodexo, and the pharmacy chain Boots, to manage the centres.</p> <p><strong>Lab tests</strong></p> <p>A coalition of private companies and public bodies have come together to form <a href=\"https://www.lighthouselabs.org.uk/\">Lighthouse Labs</a>, to test samples in three centres in Milton Keynes, Cheshire and Glasgow. Deloitte is handling payroll, rotas and other logistics, working alongside pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, as well as the army and private companies Amazon and Boots.</p> <p><strong>Nightingale hospitals</strong></p> <p>Dozens of private companies have won contracts to build, run and support the Nightingale hospitals. Consultancy firm KPMG coordinated the setting up of the first Nightingale at the ExCel centre in east London alongside military planners. Infrastructure consultants including Mott MacDonald and Archus also had roles in the project.</p> <p>Outsourcing firm Interserve worked on the construction of the Birmingham Nightingale hospital at the NEC, and was awarded a contract to hire about 1,500 staff to run the Manchester Nightingale. G4S secured the contract to supply security guards for all the Nightingale hospitals.</p> <p><strong>Recruiting extra NHS and hospital staff</strong></p> <p>Capita, another outsourcing firm, was awarded a contract to help the NHS \u201cvet and onboard thousands of returning nurses and doctors\u201d.</p> <p><strong>PPE</strong></p> <p>The government appointed Deloitte to help it ramp up British production of protective equipment and source stocks from the UK and abroad. Some figures in the UK manufacturing industry have described the project as a \u201cdisaster\u201d and accused Deloitte of pursuing factories in China \u2013 where prices have leapt and supply is tight due to huge global demand \u2013 rather than focusing on retooling UK factories to make more kit.</p> <p>Clipper Logistics, a Yorkshire-based logistics and supply chain firm founded by the Conservative donor Steve Parkin, was awarded government contract to supply and deliver protective equipment to NHS trusts, care homes other healthcare workers.</p>",
  "<p>Prepare to be told that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/virgin-and-o2-plan-merger-to-challenge-sky-and-bt\">proposed merger of Virgin Media and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/virgin-and-o2-plan-merger-to-challenge-sky-and-bt\">O2</a>, now officially under discussion, will \u201creshape\u201d the industry in the UK. In practice it will probably do the opposite. A combination of the biggest cable owner and the biggest mobile operator is far more likely to cement market shares. Regulators should be on high alert.</p> <p>Both parent companies \u2013 Liberty Global in Virgin\u2019s case and Spanish group Telef\u00f3nica with O2 \u2013 seem to be motivated primarily by the chance to extract a few cost savings. Making life hell for BT may be well down their list of priorities.</p> <p>John Malone, Liberty\u2019s 79-year-old founder and driving force, is an opportunistic deal-maker who has seen that mobile and fixed-line assets are converging in the age of 5G. He wants a UK mobile partner, which means either O2 or Vodafone.</p> <p>In the case of debt-laden Telef\u00f3nica, its plan A \u2013 a \u00a310bn sale of O2 to Hong Kong\u2019s CK Hutchison, owner of Three \u2013 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/11/three-takeover-of-o2-blocked-by-european-commission-on-competition-concerns\">blocked by regulators</a> in 2016. A deal with Liberty is its next best option. Telef\u00f3nica gets to extract a few billion quid of cash in equalisation payments to make the new venture a 50-50 enterprise. But its UK assets also become less risky in the new converged world.</p> <p>Analysts reckon Virgin/O2 may be able to save \u00a3500m a year in combination, but don\u2019t expect much (or any) of that sum to be redeployed in price cuts for consumers. Instead, we\u2019ll be told the savings are required to fund the next round of investment in broadband and 5G infrastructure.</p> <p>Up to a point, that argument has merit \u2013 massive spending on new kit is needed \u2013 but it would be nice if competition authorities remembered to extract a few up-front benefits for consumers. Opportunities don\u2019t come along often.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the regulator\u2019s hand is weak. BT\u2019s purchase of EE was approved in 2016 with no competition remedies, which paved the way for the copycat deal now coming into view. Perhaps a merger involving Virgin Media was inevitable, as deal-making investment bankers have been saying for ages, but the logic feels dispiritingly defensive.</p> <h2>NMC Health\u2019s audit postmortem inevitable</h2> <p>To no surprise whatsoever, the Financial Reporting Council <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/watchdog-investigates-ey-audit-of-scandal-hit-nmc-health\">will investigate EY\u2019s 2018 audit of NMC Health</a>. Less than a year ago, this Abu Dhabi-based operator of private hospitals was a FTSE 100 company worth \u00a34bn. Now it\u2019s in administration and its directors at the end said they (or, rather, their investigator) had unearthed $4bn (\u00a33.2bn) of undisclosed debt. So, yes, an audit postmortem was inevitable.</p> <p>But the wider issues also matter. NMC was a prime example of the London financial market\u2019s love affair with overseas-based companies with few ties to the UK. This open-doors approach to listing in the UK is great for bankers, promoters and exchanges, but who is checking the quality of the arrivals?</p> <p>After past misadventures in the mining sector \u2013 think Bumi, out of Indonesia, and ENRC from Kazakhstan \u2013 governance rules were supposedly tightened to protect minority investors in firms with controlling shareholders. Now there\u2019s NMC, which was also dominated by a few large investors and could also boast the usual crew of blue-chip advisers (Barclays, JP Morgan Cazenove and HSBC in its case).</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s inquiry into NMC is therefore as important as the FRC\u2019s investigation into EY. In fact, the process of self-examination would be better if somebody had the job of checking the FCA\u2019s own contribution to London\u2019s love of overseas listings. Were the last set of governance reforms up to scratch?</p> <h2>State support of airlines being dished out irrationally</h2> <p>Congratulations to Norwegian Air, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/norwegian-air-wins-support-for-rescue-plan-ahead-of-crunch-vote\">avoided bankruptcy</a> by wiping out (more or less) its owners and persuading its bondholders and owners of its planes to become shareholders. The mammoth debt-for-equity swap was the price to be paid to secure a government bailout and management got its deal across the line on Monday, which was not a given.</p> <p>Yet the survival of Norwegian also illustrates the truth of the grumbles from Willie Walsh at IAG and Michael O\u2019Leary at Ryanair \u2013 an awful lot of economically irrational state support is being given to airlines that were in poor shape before coronavirus. The airline market has also been full of distortions, of course \u2013 but never more so than now.</p>",
  "<p>In photographs together and with their families, the five men smile, or hold their loved ones close. All 50 or older, their friendships ranged over decades, their passions running from philanthropy to cycling, their duties from activism to business.

But in areas with large minority populations like Small Heath, Sparkhill and Hall Green, the individual grief is echoed by a wider loss \u2013 the disappearance of a generation of men who are remembered by those who loved them as central to community life.</p> <p>The five victims, close enough to be frequent guests at each other\u2019s homes for tea and gossip, present a tragic checklist of risk factors for coronavirus: all male, all older, all of Asian descent, some with underlying health problems. In interviews with the Guardian, their relatives and friends reflected on dozens more in the community \u2013 Asian, middle-aged men living in historically impoverished areas \u2013 who have also died, and on the legacy that has gone with them.</p> <p>\u201cTheir generation came over when times were much harder and they laid the foundations for us,\u201d said Amer Awan. \u201cWithout them we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today.

The men lived and worked within a 10-mile radius. Their deaths, their families say, suggest that the claim that \u201cthis disease does not discriminate\u201d is hollow.</p> <p>The group were often seen together at charity events and celebrations, with several of them members of the local Labour party. They were entrepreneurial as well as political, employing large numbers of local people in their businesses. But most of all, their loved ones said, they were strong family men to whom others looked for direction and advice.</p> <p>Amer\u2019s father, 67-year-old Nazir, was a multi-millionaire businessman known for his philanthropy.

All five men lost their fathers in the space of just 17 days.</p> <p>Wassan came to Birmingham from Pakistan in the 1970s, aged 21, with his brother Ashraf, and devoted his life to the city.

In a temporary morgue in the car park of Central Jamia Mosque Ghamkol Sharif, large stacks of empty coffins are piled up.</p> <p> In the space of just a few weeks the funeral service at this mosque alone dealt with approximately 70 deaths, out of which there were 40 confirmed cases.</p> <p>Mosque trustee Ahsan ul Haq said that on some days they were collecting up to five bodies. Muslim coronavirus victims were transported from hospitals, and placed in refrigerators inside a tent before they were laid to rest in accordance with Islamic religion.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe had to do this because of the high death rate of Muslims from Covid-19.

That is anathema to Beijing, which depicts Taiwan as a renegade province.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s more of a worry at the top in Beijing that what the party has been paranoid about for a really long time is now coming to pass, which is that the US and other nations don\u2019t want the party to rule China,\u201d said Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at the Asia Society\u2019s Center on US-China Relations.</p> <p>Stone Fish said that the cold war-era policy of pushing for a peaceful evolution away from Communist party rule was now \u201ccoming back into fashion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a growing awareness in DC that the Chinese Communist party doesn\u2019t serve America\u2019s interest, that it doesn\u2019t serve the interests of many people in China, and there\u2019s growing debate about what the US should do about that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Much will depend now on how seriously Xi takes that challenge and how he responds. Glaser said there has been evidence that Beijing is seeking to tamp down militaristic nationalism focused on the reconquest of Taiwan. But Fish argues that calculus could change as the pressure increases.</p> <p>\u201cIf Xi Jinping or other members of the party feel like they\u2019re facing existential threat in terms of legitimacy domestically, going to war with Taiwan could be a very sound strategy for them, in ways that would have a lot of awful impacts globally.\u201d</p>",

A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as \u201ca man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month\u201d. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that \u201cdefies the usual ways of operating\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019ll need a truly global effort \u2013 because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It\u2019s humanity against the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China.</p> \n<p>Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said \u201cwe support the leadership of the World Health Organization\u201d, adding that without the UN body \u201can effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said that \u201cmultilateral cooperation is more important than ever\u201d and the meeting was the start of a global movement \u201cnever seen before\u201d.</p> \n<p>At the parallel \u201cnon-aligned movement\u201d summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as \u201ca strategic blunder\u201d.</p> \n<p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally.</p> \n<p>The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the \u20ac7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around \u20ac500m each. Turkey\u2019s contribution will be announced later in the month.</p> \n<p>The precise value of individual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed \u201cfantastic momentum\u201d and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus.</p> \n<p>From the \u20ac7.5bn initially sought, \u20ac4bn is for the development of a vaccine, \u20ac2bn for treatments and \u20ac1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission.</p> \n<p>The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible.</p> \n<p>The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: \u201cI would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit \u2026 both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cMy guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: \u201cWe have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries?\u201d</p>",

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that from tonight contact tracing will go live in the Isle of Wight. </strong>A new government app that will alert people if they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus is being piloted on the island, and Hancock urged islanders to dowload it. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Last week we put in place the testing capability on the island, from tonight the contact tracing capability will go live and from tomorrow NHS staff on the island will be able to download the app. From Thursday, each one of the 80,000 households on the island will get a letter from the chief nurse with comprehensive information about the trial. Islanders will then be able to install the app.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Addressing islanders directly, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>By downloading the app you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said he would hire more than the 18,000 contact tracers already being recruited if necessary.</strong> That was just the initial number being trained this month to operate contact tracing on a national basis, he said. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no magic around the 18,000 figure, that is the initial scale that we think is necessary.</p> \n   <p>If it needs to be bigger, when we find out from the ONS survey that is in the field at the moment what the prevalence of the disease is \u2013 the number of new cases per day actually out there rather than that we find through positive tests \u2013 then we will adjust that figure.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said, although the contact tracing scheme would help the government to suppress the coronavirus, the national system did not have to be in place before lockdown measures could be eased.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We haven\u2019t said we can\u2019t make changes [to lockdown] before [contact tracing] is up and running. It is just that the test, track and trace system will help us get R [the reproduction number] down and the lower the number of new cases, the more effective it will be.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 85,186 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. </strong>That means, for the second day in a row, the government has failed to hit the target of 100,000 tests a day set for the end of April.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said that it would take some time before scientists find out whether people who have had coronavirus develop immunity.</strong> But \u201cthe overwhelming majority\u201d of people who have had it have antibodies, a precursor for immunity, he said. Hancock revealed that, as someone who has had the illness himself, he is taking part in trials to check his antibody levels. But he said he would not feel confident going into a crowded room because he could not assume he was immune. And he could not make policy yet on the basis that people with the antibody are immune, he said.

Despite their extremely draconian nature, the regulations are secondary legislation, and they were introduced under a procedure that meant they became law before MPs had voted on them.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sir Graham Brady,</strong> the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, used his speech to urge ministers to lift the current lockdown measures \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d.

We had to contact IQVIA again who assured us someone would turn up to take our blood and swabs the next day. Again, they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bernie Spratt said: \u201cWe replied to the invitation on 23 April and were given a home visit date of 27 April when an IQVIA nurse would arrive and test us both. Nobody arrived so we phoned the study contact line and rebooked for Thursday the 30th. Once again nobody arrived so we re-booked for Saturday 2 May. Saturday came and went and so I rang the study contact line again this morning and was told that the reason for the \u2018no shows\u2019 was that there were no test kits available in our area (Shipston on Stour).\u201d</p> \n  <p>The study involves the University of Oxford, data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes.

The Daily Express was one of a number of national newspapers to carry the prime minister\u2019s call for the world to work together to find a cure for Covid-19 on their front pages, with its headline reading: \u201cBoris leads \u00a36bn global race for vaccine.\u201d<br><br tabindex=\"-1\">Responding to a question from Labour\u2019s Paul Blomfield, Gove told parliament: \u201cWe will cooperate not just with our European neighbours but with other countries in the fight against Covid-19. He\u2019s right to say the prime minister is joining the call today in order to ensure that we can support the effort to secure a vaccine. The effort to secure a vaccine is necessarily an international one.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">Blomfield asked Gove if, given the UK\u2019s involvement with the EU\u2019s initiative, the government would be joining the bloc\u2019s early warning and response system (EWRS) for pandemics, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/02/uk-seeks-access-to-eu-health-cooperation-in-light-of-coronavirus?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">The Guardian reported this weekend</a> that the British government was quietly seeking to access the EWRS, despite early reluctance to cooperate on health after Brexit.<br>Gove dodged the question about the EWRS, but said: \u201cWe will of course look pragmatically at how we can co-operate with our European friends and partners. But participation in the EMA would involve, certainly at the moment, the acceptance of the ECJ (European court of justice) oversight and that\u2019s not something that the British people voted to do.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"><br tabindex=\"-1\">Commenting on Gove\u2019s response, Blomfield said. \u201cMichael Gove was right to recognise this international partnership to find a coronavirus vaccine as an EU initiative and not a Boris Johnson project as claimed by some of the Conservative press. But he should also pledge to join the EU\u2019s pandemic early warning system, as the NHS wants, and think again about leaving the European Medicines Agency.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T18:16:30.917Z\">at 7.16pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb049178f08a69c6c689ac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T16:57:25.843Z\">5.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Q: Given the lockdown still applies on the Isle of Wight, will it generate enough data for the app?</em></p> \n  <p>Hancock says he thinks it will.

Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As lockdown is eased, ensuring that those who could work from home reasonably productively are doing so should be a policy priority. It dampens the trade-off between the level of economic activity and the rate of virus transmission. It benefits not only those who can work from home; it also enables more of those who cannot work from home to go to work, without society once again seeing a spike in virus infections large enough to precipitate the re-introduction of lockdown which would once again threaten their livelihoods. But there is obvious potential for market failure here resulting in insufficient working from home. Some of the benefits from doing so accrue not to the individuals or firms themselves but to others in society (through lower virus transmission); and working from home may require investments and adaptations that the uncertain environment could inhibit ...</p> \n   <p>Potential policy levers include: </p> \n   <p><strong>Subsidies for firms or workers who are operating from home.</strong> The theoretical case for these is clear, given the externalities, though the practical design could be challenging, e.g. to avoid large deadweight.</p> \n   <p><strong>Norm-setting.</strong> Simply sending a strong signal that certain sectors or occupations are expected to work from home, and that failing to do so is deemed unacceptable and irresponsible, may have a significant effect. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a summary of the IFS paper <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14829\">here.</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb02e518f0826dcf8dc2c90\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nicola-davis\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T15:02:01.965Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve \u2013 Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics \u2013 has weighed up the evidence and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://rs-delve.github.io/reports/2020/05/04/face-masks-for-the-general-public.html\">come out in favour of the public wearing facemasks</a>, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle covid-19.

In a statement she said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I applied for the role of general secretary in 2018 it was because I wanted to support Jeremy Corbyn, who inspired so many people to get involved in politics with his message of hope, equality and peace</p> \n   <p>It has been a huge privilege to be general secretary of the largest political party in Europe for the last two years, but now we have a new leadership team it is the right time to step down. I would like to thank Jeremy, our members and my staff colleagues who have given me so much support during what has been a very challenging period, in particular when I was suffering from ill health.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is important because the general secretary runs Labour HQ and Formby\u2019s resignation means that Sir Keir Starmer can now install one of his own allies in the post. Formby, who worked for Unite before becoming general secretary in 2018, was close to Jeremy Corbyn and his faction in the party. In the Conservative party a new leader is free to install his or her acolytes in top jobs at party HQ but in the Labour party the general secretary is more independent, and harder to move if he or she has the backing of the national executive committee. It took Corbyn more than two years to instal a general secretary viewed as a loyalist.</p> \n  <p>Paying tribute to Formby, Starmer said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would like to thank Jennie for her service, and for the personal and professional efforts she has made in advancing the cause she has fought all her life for.</p> \n   <p>Jennie has led our party\u2019s organisation with commitment and energy through a period of political upheaval, including a snap general election last year. I wish her the very best for the future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Labour\u2019s NEC will meet soon to decide the timetable for electing a new general secretary.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbdcd8fa2ee7be3bf4fef6fdaf912ce206c71b6d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbdcd8fa2ee7be3bf4fef6fdaf912ce206c71b6d/0_114_4500_2702/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennie Formby with Jeremy Corbyn at last year\u2019s Labour conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennie Formby with Jeremy Corbyn at last year\u2019s Labour conference.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T11:21:14.182Z\">at 12.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaff94d8f0826dcf8dc2981\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T11:15:39.693Z\">12.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Asda has offered priority delivery slots to thousands of care homes for the next six months and donated 250,000 face masks to protect workers and residents, the supermarket said. </p> \n  <p>Bosses said 3,500 care homes across the country will be able to book the slots. </p> \n  <p>It follows similar moves by other supermarkets to offer deliveries to those finding it hardest to get to stores during the coronavirus lockdown. </p> \n  <p>The Asda chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: \u201cThe impact of Covid on our care system has been the subject of numerous news reports in recent days, and the challenges facing our nation\u2019s care homes and the staff who are working so hard to protect some of our most vulnerable people have been heartbreaking to see. </p> \n  <p>\u201cGiving priority access to these amazing care homes is, I believe, the right thing for us to do - and I am proud that, having built the capacity of our online delivery service in recent weeks from 450,000 slots to 700,000 weekly slots, we are able to do this for our care homes.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The medical-grade masks will be delivered later this month, he added. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T11:20:21.725Z\">at 12.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaff5cb8f082b32fdd6ce2e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T11:03:09.242Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The \u201calternative Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies]\u201d meeting (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/04/uk-coronavirus-live-draft-rules-on-post-lockdown-workplaces-leaked?page=with:block-5eafd0698f082b32fdd6cc79#block-5eafd0698f082b32fdd6cc79\">9.29am)</a> organised by<strong> Sir David King,</strong> the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser, is just getting going now.

In the letter to the complainant, who is not named in the report, Burns also suggested that he might raise the case in the Commons chamber using parliamentary privilege if his father did not get the money he felt was owed to him.</p> \n  <p>In his conclusion the standards committee said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Like the [parliamentary commissioner for standards], we are persuaded by the evidence that Mr Burns used his parliamentary position in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public into doing as Mr Burns wished, in a dispute relating to purely private family interests which had no connection with Mr Burns\u2019 parliamentary duties. Mr Burns persisted in making veiled threats to use parliamentary privilege to further his family\u2019s interests even during the course of the commissioner\u2019s investigation. He also misleadingly implied that his conduct had the support of the house authorities.</p> \n   <p>Parliamentary privilege, particularly the privilege of freedom of speech, is precious to our democracy. The right of members of parliament to speak in the chamber without fear or favour is essential to parliament\u2019s ability to scrutinise the executive and to tackle social abuses, particularly if the latter are committed by the rich and powerful who might use the threat of defamation proceedings to deter legitimate criticism. Precisely because parliamentary privilege is so important, it is essential to maintaining public respect for parliament that the protection afforded by privilege should not be abused by a member in the pursuit of their purely private and personal interests. We, like the commissioner, conclude that Mr Burns was guilty of abusing his privileged status in an attempt to intimidate a member of the public.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burns told the committee that he accepted he should not have written the letter he did on Commons notepaper, but that he was under a \u201chuge amount of personal stress\u201d at the time. He said he was sorry for what he had done.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T10:53:09.128Z\">at 11.53am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eafed238f0806a479812b7b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-04T10:31:29.721Z\">11.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Conor Burns resigns as international trade minister after inquiry rules he abused position as MP</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Downing Street has announced that <strong>Conor Burns</strong> has resigned as an international trade minister.

I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ve already covered the main lines from the interviews giving by <strong>Ben Wallace</strong>, the defence secretary, this morning. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/04/uk-coronavirus-live-draft-rules-on-post-lockdown-workplaces-leaked?page=with:block-5eafc6eb8f0806a479812a1e#block-5eafc6eb8f0806a479812a1e\"> 8.49am.)</a> Here are some of the other points he\u2019s been making.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wallace refused to back President Trump\u2019s claim that evidence exists to show the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory.</strong> Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, went further yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">claiming there was \u201cenormous\u201d evidence to this effect.</a> But Wallace would not endorse these claims. Asked if he agreed, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the time for postmortem into this global pandemic viral spread is for once we all have as much data as possible, the testing around the world produces solid and realistic results about who is infected, how it acts with different people, and also when there\u2019s potentially a vaccine in place.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s the time to have those types of discussions.</p> \n   <p>By me speculating or talking about what I think about China or anyone else isn\u2019t going to help the fight against coronavirus in the UK right now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Wallace rejected claims there was a blanket rule saying the over-70s have to rigorously self-isolate. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a blanket view of the over-70s. If you are over 70 and you have a range of conditions you are viewed as very highly clinically vulnerable and you should take extra measures.</p> \n   <p>If you are over 70 you should take extra precautions but it is not a blanket rule that if you are over 70 at the moment you are going to be treated differently from other people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wallace\u2019s comment is correct, but it is striking that six weeks into the lockdown, there is still confusion about what the rules actually say. The problem was also highlighted by this tweet at the weekend from <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, in response to the Sunday Times splash.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1256710939845558273\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sad to see another factually wrong &amp; misleading article on p1 of the Sunday Times. <br><br>The clinically vulnerable, who are advised to stay in lockdown for 12 weeks, emphatically DO NOT include all over 70s. <br><br>I\u2019ve asked for an urgent correction. <a href=\"https://t.co/WGj1eOtqHl\">pic.twitter.com/WGj1eOtqHl</a></p>\u2014 Matt Hancock (@MattHancock) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1256710939845558273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The confusion arises because there are three groups of people covered by social distancing rules: non-vulnerable people; around 1.5m people described as \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d, who have been told to \u201cshield\u201d at home at least until the end of June; and the over-70s and other \u201cclinically vulnerable\u201d people.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19\">Special rules (pdf) </a>apply to the \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I strongly believe the public aren\u2019t stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media.

The probability of being infected is much less.</p> \n   <p>I think there are options about how we can do it.

I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest updates in the country\u2019s response to the pandemic.</p> \n  <p>A draft government plan to ease the coronavirus lockdown has been seen by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52525127\">the BBC</a>. It includes the suggestion that employers should minimise the number of people using equipment, stagger shift times, reduce hot desking and maximise home-working. The guidance also states that \u2013 where the 2 metre physical distance between employers can\u2019t be maintained \u2013 PPE, screens and additional hygiene procedures should be used.</p> \n  <p>The director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, <strong>Adam Marshall, </strong>told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning that businesses needed the government to be as specific as possible in its guidance. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need as much specificity as possible so businesses can ensure they\u2019ve taken all the steps they can in order to protect their people.</p> \n   <p>And as much as possible we want to see consistency across the UK it would be very confusing and costly for businesses if we saw different nations going in very different directions.</p> \n   <p>They (bosses) will want to know that they\u2019re not going to be held liable to horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they\u2019ve done everything in their power to keep their people safe.</p> \n   <p>Whereas by contrast you\u2019d want to see those employers who didn\u2019t take adequate steps face the consequences of that so the question of legal liability is extremely important.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Elsewhere, a request by UK universities for a \u00a32bn bailout has been rejected by the government. <strong>Michelle Donelan</strong>, the universities minister, has instead said that institutions could continue to charge the full \u00a39,250 annual tuition fee for undergraduates while campuses remained closed and face-to-face classes were suspended, as long high standards of online teaching were maintained. The government will also bring forward \u00a32.6bn in tuition fees that universities would have received at the start of the next academic year, as well as \u00a3100m in research funding.

  "<p>\u201cThe undisguised brutality of our time is weighing heavily upon us. Tomorrow she is to be cremated, our poor Sunday child!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/slightly-blighty/202004/covid-19-the-couch-sigmund-freuds-surprising-analysis\" title=\"\">So wrote Sigmund Freud</a> in January 1920, two days after his 27-year-old daughter Sophie died of Spanish flu (due to travel restrictions, he had not been allowed to visit during her illness). Just as during the global pandemic of a century ago, for bereaved families these are desperately sad times, and the enforced separations can feel like salt rubbed into wounds. In addition to grief, many families \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/families-of-nhs-and-care-staff-who-died-from-covid-19-to-get-60000\" title=\"\">those of medical workers</a> left on the frontline without protection \u2013 are dealing with anger about the way the crisis has been handled.</p> <p>But what is the mood of the population as a whole? How widespread is the sense of loss and fear about the disease and the future? New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/04/half-of-british-adults-felt-anxious-about-covid-19-lockdown\" title=\"\">sharp rise in levels of anxiety</a>, and a corresponding decline in happiness, in the days on either side of the 23 March lockdown. About half of the people surveyed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/personalandeconomicwellbeingintheuk/may2020\" title=\"\">equating to over 25 million British adults</a> \u2013 reported high anxiety during that period, more than double the average in the final quarter of last year. The number reporting low happiness levels more than doubled \u2013 with the most common causes being personal wellbeing and loneliness, and the threat to jobs and finances.</p> <p>While the ONS found raised anxiety levels persisting into April, and police have pointed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/police-absences-may-lead-to-rise-in-suicides-mps-told\" title=\"\">early signs of an increase</a> in suicides and suicide attempts, initial reports from another <a href=\"https://www.marchnetwork.org/research\" title=\"\">study</a> suggest that, over the six weeks of the lockdown, the situation for some groups has improved (although not people living alone, with low incomes or diagnosed mental illnesses). There have been clinical and personal accounts too of people who, far from feeling worse during the pandemic, for various reasons actually feel better. Examples include children who prefer home to school, and adults who have found relief from personal demons in the common enemy represented by the virus.</p> <p>It is natural to latch on to such counterintuitive instances. It\u2019s good to know that the pandemic is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-lockdown-anxiety-mental-health\" title=\"\">not making everything worse</a> for everyone. And while increased worry and reduced wellbeing among the general population is likely to signal a rise in some kinds of mental health problems, we must not assume that people already suffering from depression or anxiety are necessarily less well now than they were before. Some professionals have found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/therapy-during-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-psychoanalysis-freud\" title=\"\">remote working better than expected</a>, with specialist volunteering initiatives such as one by the Association of Child Psychotherapists offering free supervision to those using video for the first time.</p> <p>But there are grave concerns, both about the disincentives to seeking help or treatment during the lockdown and about inequality. Women are already reported to be <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/the-three-groups-reacting-to-life-under-lockdown\" title=\"\">more depressed</a> than men, and the negative effects of being stuck at home are worse for families with pre-existing difficulties. Single-person households and adolescents cut off from their peer groups are affected in specific ways. The global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/28/calamitous-domestic-violence-set-to-soar-by-20-during-global-lockdown-coronavirus\" title=\"\">rise in domestic violence</a> is horrifying.</p> <p>As time goes on, feelings will go on changing. While it\u2019s important to recognise trends, there must be room for nuance as well as dismay at what Freud, a century ago, called that pandemic\u2019s \u201cundisguised brutality\u201d.</p>",

In one area, the use of acoustic devices that emit recorded gull distress calls is being trialled to deter them from nesting on city rooftops.

  "<p>Australians are warming up to the idea of easing Covid-19 restrictions, with the number of people saying it is too soon to stop the lockdowns falling from 49% to 37% over the past fortnight, according to the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/the-guardian-essential-report\">Guardian Essential poll.</a></p> <p>The latest survey of 1,093 respondents comes as the national cabinet meets on Tuesday to continue deliberations on the relaxation of current restrictions on non-essential services, and consider the possible implementation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/jacinda-ardern-joins-national-cabinet-meeting-as-australia-new-zealand-share-coronavirus-strategy\">a trans-Tasman \u201ctravel bubble\u201d</a> between Australia and New Zealand \u2013 with Jacinda Ardern dialling in by video-conference.</p> <p>While survey participants are more favourably disposed to easing public health-related restrictions in Australia than they were two weeks ago, the latest poll suggests people are divided on school closures.</p> <p>Half the sample agreed with the statement \u201cschools should teach most students remotely until the Covid-19 outbreak passes\u201d and 41% of respondents with children agreed with the statement: \u201cEven if schools in my state are open, I will still choose to keep my children home because of the Covid-19 outbreak.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/04/eden-monaro-byelection-pandemic-coronoavirus-coalition-labor-nationals-liberals-nsw-politics\">Eden-Monaro byelection offers the first tantalising taste of post-pandemic politics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just under half the sample, 45%, said schools should reopen for all children, and 52%, agreed with the statement: \u201cIt is unreasonable to expect teachers to prepare separate lessons for children who are learning remotely and for children who still attend school.\u201d</p> <p>Around a third of the sample, 36%, think restrictions should start to ease over the next month or two. Only 10% are in rush, saying restrictions should go as soon as possible.</p> <p>People over the age of 55 are more reluctant to wind back controls than younger people, with 44% of those over 55 in the sample saying it\u2019s too soon compared with 28% of people between 18 and 34. Women are also more likely to be cautious than men.</p> <p>Morrison has been keen to project that Australia is now on a path to easing some of the Covid-19 restrictions now that the curve of infections has been flattened, and concrete steps are expected to be announced this Friday.</p> <p>The prime minister has also pressed for school students to return to classroom learning, but the states have moved slowly on reopening schools, with Victoria refusing to switch course until the state has conducted mass testing over the next week.</p> <p>Tensions between the jurisdictions boiled over on Sunday. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, launched a swingeing political attack on the Victorian premier, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/daniel-andrews\">Daniel Andrews</a>, accusing him of taking a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education.</p> <p>Tehan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/federal-education-minister-dan-tehan-says-he-overstepped-the-mark-criticising-victoria-over-schools?CMP=share_btn_tw\">withdrew his comments a couple of hours later</a> after Victoria queried whether he had overstepped the mark, and announced it would close a school campus because a teacher had returned a positive test for Covid-19. The federal education minister later blamed the outburst on \u201cfrustration\u201d.</p> <p>The closure of schools has been a persistent source of tension between the jurisdictions, but Andrews told reporters in Melbourne on Monday the national cabinet continued to work well, was taking the advice of \u201cexperts\u201d and would not let \u201cpersonal frustrations\u201d get in the way of good decision-making.</p> <p>The latest survey suggests Morrison\u2019s response to the pandemic is continuing to get a thumbs up from voters. The prime minister\u2019s approval rating has increased in the latest survey for the fourth straight month. In February it was 39% and now it is 64%. Morrison is enjoying approval from 92% of Coalition voters.</p> <p>Morrison is also comfortably ahead of the Labor leader Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister, with 50% of participants rating him ahead of Albanese, who is on 25%. Around a quarter of the sample is undecided on this question.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/29/private-school-funding-linked-to-reopening-from-coronavirus-lockdown-attacked-in-victoria\">Private school funding linked to reopening from coronavirus lockdown attacked in Victoria</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Albanese\u2019s approval rating is 42%. A month ago it was 44%. Albanese\u2019s approval among Labor voters is 63%. Given this is Albanese\u2019s first term as Labor leader, he has a higher proportion of voters who are undecided about whether they approve or disapprove of his performance. The undecided cohort had been trending down over the opening months of 2020, but it is now back up again to 31%.</p> <p>Morrison may be the beneficiary of comparisons with the United States and the United Kingdom. While a strong majority of Australians surveyed rate New Zealand\u2019s handling of the crisis as either good or very good (79%) \u2013 with Australia and New Zealand enjoying comparable success in flattening the curve of infections \u2013 71% of the sample thinks the Trump administration has bungled the crisis.</p> <p>The United Kingdom also rates poorly, with 48% saying there has been a poor response in that country.</p> <p>While Morrison has been at pains to say the fiscal support given to Australians during the crisis is finite, the survey suggests there would be community support for boosting the rate of unemployment benefits after the current crisis passes.</p> <p>More than half the sample, 57% favours keeping Newstart at the level it has been during the crisis, so effectively doubled, or aligning it with the rate paid to single pensioners.

My five-year-old daughter and I made a last-minute decision to fly from Sydney to Melbourne to see the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final on International Women\u2019s Day.</p> <p>It was a costly and complicated exercise, involving a 4am start on the Monday to get back in time for work and school, but as we hiked our way up to the top of the stadium and turned to face the magnificent field, I instantly knew it would be worth every dollar and every bit of trouble.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/01/community-sport-resume-australia-coronavirus-restrictions\">When will community sports resume as Australia moves out of Covid-19 restrictions?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our feeling of being two of the 86,174 fans filling one of the world\u2019s most iconic venues in a celebration of women\u2019s sport was overwhelming. The crack of the ball hitting Alyssa Healy\u2019s bat as she effortlessly guided another delivery to the boundary was echoed in stereo by the roar of the crowd. The eclectic mix of spectators \u2013 female, male, young and old, from countless backgrounds \u2013 were all in tune as the Mexican wave circled the stadium again and again.</p> <p>It was by no means a close game, not one that came down to the final ball, but it was historic nonetheless. A genuine I was theremoment.</p> <p>Then, swiftly, everything changed. Within five days, no one was \u201cthere\u201d at all. Half-hearted banter and weird elbow bumps echoed around empty stadiums. Another two weeks and there was no longer a there at all. Nowhere to be but home, sweating on a yoga mat in time to a jumpy Zoom exercise class or on the couch in my pyjamas watching a replay of the 2006 Ashes with a bottle of panic-bought pinot grigio.</p> <p>At first it was a bit of a novelty. Stumbling along trying to follow athletes\u2019 home workouts, and taking the opportunity to rewatch some classic games from years gone by had its appeal. But despite all my best efforts, all I felt was an overwhelming sense of loss. It was a strange kind of loss \u2013 I know logically that there is no safe way for sport to exist right now and I\u2019m fully supportive of those measures to keep everyone safe.</p> <p>But for many of us, our identity is intertwined with our sporting passions. In a world without sport, we lose that easy shorthand of understanding who we are. I\u2019m a cricket lover and a netball tragic \u2013 the kind of person who flies interstate for 24 hours just to watch a game, who has sworn allegiance to Nat Medhurst and thinks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/11/wing-defence-the-most-underrated-and-influential-of-netball-positions\">playing wing defence</a> is a personality trait.</p> <p>When I tell other rugby league fans that I follow the St George Illawarra Dragons, they understand something deeper about me than just that I wear a red V on the hill at Kogarah Oval. They know it means I hate myself just a little, that I\u2019m an eternal pessimist, that this was something I was born into because it\u2019s not a fate anyone would choose for themselves.</p> <p>With all this swept away, I\u2019m faced with a sense of identity that is more complex, that requires more introspection than I feel comfortable with. It\u2019s not something to be proud of, but when your work, volunteering and leisure time are so tied up in sport then it\u2019s hard to find your feet when those rugs get so swiftly pulled from under you.</p> <p>Compounding that loss of identity is an aching for the safe uncertainty that sport provides. When I walk into a stadium, I can\u2019t know for sure if the team I\u2019m there to support will crush all before them, take a close and measured win or suffer a heartbreaking last-minute loss.</p> <p>The losses hurt, of course, but I\u2019m prepared for them. I know all the possible outcomes when I walk in \u2013 it\u2019s enough uncertainty to keep me on the edge of my seat, but not enough to keep me lying awake at night wondering what the future holds.</p> <p>While the current situation has reduced each individual day to the crushingly mundane and the global future to the terrifyingly unknown, sport offers just the opposite. It allows us to feel as if anything is possible, while also gently corralling us along to the reassuringly timed finals series. A sense of chaos within a perfectly controlled situation.</p> <p>When all this is over, when the world returns to some form of normality, I hope we will see significant change in sport. I want to see it become something I can proudly tie my identity to; that it will be more humble, more inclusive and more progressive.</p> <p>But that feeling of unpredictability on game day, where the stakes are high enough to get my blood pumping but low enough to stave off a panic attack? You can pry that from my cold, dead hands.</p>",

thing to consider.\u201d</p> <p>Andrews has said his decision on schools will be based on Sutton\u2019s advice and Sutton has refused to reconsider his advice on sending children back to school until the state of emergency is reviewed on 11 May.</p> <p>There have been indications that students in Victoria could stay learning from home for the entirety of term two.</p> <h2>What is the AHPPC advice on schools?</h2> <p>These are the seven principles from the AHPPC on schooling, agreed by all state and territory chief health officers:</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Our schools are critical to the delivery of high-quality education for students and to give our children the best possible start in life. Our education systems are based on the recognition that education is best delivered by professional teachers to students in the classroom on a school campus.<br><strong>2.</strong> It is accepted that during the Covid-19 crisis, alternative flexible, remote delivery of education services may be needed. <br><strong>3</strong>. Our schools must be healthy and safe environments for students, teachers and other staff to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of education to students. <br><strong>4.</strong> State and territory governments and non-government sector authorities are responsible for managing and making operational decisions for their school systems respectively, subject to compliance with relevant funding agreements with the commonwealth. <br><strong>5.</strong> Decisions regarding the response to Covid-19 in the schooling sector must continue to be informed by expert, official, national and state-based public health and education advice, consistent with these national principles. <br><strong>6.</strong> All students must continue to be supported by their school to ensure participation in quality education during the Covid-19 crisis. <br><strong>7.</strong> The health advice consistently provided by the AHPPC is that attendance at a school campus for education represents a very low health risk to students. The advice also notes that appropriate practices must be employed at schools, like at other workplaces, to provide a safe working environment for school staff, including teachers, and that the specific AHPPC advice regarding school campuses should be followed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"597713af57e6410f0859fa7c027ccd4dc2f68bc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/597713af57e6410f0859fa7c027ccd4dc2f68bc5/0_29_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cleaner is seen inside of a classroom at Meadowglen primary school in Melbourne, where a teacher tested positive to the virus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cleaner is seen inside a classroom at Meadowglen primary school in Melbourne, where a teacher tested positive to the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Barbour/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What can be done to protect teachers?</h2> <p>The AHPPC has <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-advice-on-reducing-the-potential-risk-of-covid-19-transmission-in-schools\">set out advice</a> on what can be done at schools to protect everyone within the school, including staggering start and finish times, smaller classes, physical distancing in staff rooms, and cancelling of group work, school excursions and other activities where 1.5m physical distancing can\u2019t be enforced.</p> <p>The advice does not recommend use of personal protective equipment or temperature checks for students on entry into schools.</p> <p>Queensland is <a href=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2020/5/4/queensland-success-leads-sensible-steps-back-to-school\">staggering its return</a> of students over a couple of weeks, as well as implementing social-distancing measures.

  "<h2>Edgar Wright, director and writer</h2> <p>Simon Pegg was the first person I\u2019d ever met who was as obsessed with George Romero\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/mar/26/dvdreviews.shopping7\">Dawn of the Dead</a> as I was. One evening, I was round at Simon and his pal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/10/nick-frost-interview-i-have-a-beautiful-life-at-the-moment-fighting-with-my-family\">Nick Frost</a>\u2019s flat for drinks when I said we should make our own zombie movie, a horror comedy. It would be from the point of view of two bit-players, two idiots who were the last to know what was going on, after waking up hungover on a Sunday morning.</p> <p>A flash point came when I ventured out once to buy milk at five in the morning, after staying up playing Resident Evil. I was taken with how deserted and eerie the streets were. What would a British person do if zombies appeared now? In American zombie movies, everyone had high-powered weapons. What would someone do without all that? This turned into the first scene I filmed, where Shaun walks to the shop completely oblivious to the zombie attack.</p> <p>We wouldn\u2019t have been able to make the film without fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/11/the-stars-of-spaced-reunited-21st-anniversary-simon-pegg-jessica-hynes-edgar-wright-nick-frost\">Spaced</a>, the sitcom I\u2019d worked on with Simon. We put a call out, asking them to be our zombie extras, and the response was overwhelming. We had no money to pay them, though, and I\u2019m keenly aware that after the long hours they put in, some of them weren\u2019t Spaced fans afterwards. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIfcaZ4pC-4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LIfcaZ4pC-4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIfcaZ4pC-4\">Watch a trailer for Shaun of the Dead</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Our zombies spent a week cooped up on set. They had to stand outside The Winchester, the pub where our heroes take refuge, banging on the windows and not doing much else really. When we eventually involved them properly, they had this electric energy: a pure, crazed hysteria. I needed to record some zombie sounds so one lunchtime I stood in the middle of the pub and asked them all to attack me. One came straight at me and bit my leg. They\u2019d gone feral.</p> <p>We wrote to people asking if would be OK for us to trash their records. Simon sent a nice letter to Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits asking if we could use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/12/brothers-in-arms-cd\">Brothers in Arms</a>, but it came to nothing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/25/sade-profile-interview-1984-archive\">Sade</a> was the coolest. She said we could trash Diamond Life without hesitation. We were going to have a David Bowie joke in the part where they\u2019re deciding which records to throw at the zombies. \u201cHunky Dory? Ziggy Stardust? <em>The Labyrinth Soundtrack!</em>\u201d In the end, we went with Prince because we thought it was funnier: \u201cPurple Rain? Sign O\u2019 the Times?<em> The Batman Soundtrack!</em> Throw it!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/helen-mirren\">Helen Mirren</a> turned down the part of Barbara, Shaun\u2019s mother. She sent us a note saying she wanted to be Nick, because he had funnier lines. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/12/bill-nighy-im-not-in-any-trouble-everybody-can-relax\">Bill Nighy</a> said yes immediately but, being a dapper dresser, wasn\u2019t too impressed by his character\u2019s beige, suburban wardrobe. He still managed to look dashing.</p> <p>A bunch of kids were unhappy about us filming on their estate. They threw stones and eggs. The only way we could stop them was by giving them parts. They went through full makeup and eventually became teenage zombies. It was a case of keep your friends close but your zombie enemies closer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93f3d10027c0b56eba93fda7b893a012ffb4b7a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f3d10027c0b56eba93fda7b893a012ffb4b7a0/0_0_3000_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They\u2019ve gone feral\u2019 \u2026 the extras move in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They\u2019ve gone feral\u2019 \u2026 the extras move in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An extra came up to me one day and, thinking I was a crew member, said: \u201cStraight to video, this one.\u201d The success rate for British films was still quite low and one of the biggest jobs was convincing everyone the effort was going to be worthwhile. Later, we sent all the people who said nice things about the film a name tag, like Shaun\u2019s but with their name on it. I got an email from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/stephenking\">Stephen King</a> telling me he was wearing his. And when Simon and I eventually met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jul/17/george-a-romero-obituary\">George Romero</a>, he had his on.</p> <p>Romero saw the film before its release, but Universal had a security guard watch it with him. I love the fact they thought he was going to pirate a movie that was a tribute to him. It was an amazing year, probably the best year of my life.</p> <h2>Simon Pegg, actor and writer</h2> <p>I wrote an episode of Spaced where my character fights zombies in his flat. We had such a fun time shooting it, we thought we ought to make a zombie movie \u2013 like it was <em>that</em> easy. We really were so naive. We thought we could do anything.</p> <p>Edgar loved Queen and had the idea of playing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/aug/12/olympics-team-gb-sing-queen-video\">Don\u2019t Stop Me Now</a> \u2013 one of the most positive, exciting, happy tunes ever \u2013 over a scene of extreme violence in The Winchester. We choreographed the entire fight to that song, which was a real worry because it hadn\u2019t been cleared for use and could have ended up being way too expensive. So we wrote a begging letter to Queen guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/brian-may\">Brian May</a> and he was lovely about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24e0b3d6d97958c9aa420e55f39863a505c39c35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24e0b3d6d97958c9aa420e55f39863a505c39c35/0_0_3000_1965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We spent ages in the pub\u2019 \u2026 Kate Ashfield and Simon Pegg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We spent ages in the pub\u2019 \u2026 Kate Ashfield and Simon Pegg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photos 12/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We spent ages in the pub set. It was a really hot summer and one of the zombies fainted. Fortunately, there was a working tap and the cast would have a much-needed beer after filming. Steve Emerson played John the zombie landlord. He\u2019d been a stuntman on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/07/the-day-i-met-john-wayne-on-an-industrial-estate-in-middlesex\">Brannigan</a>, we discovered, and had been thrown into a jukebox by John Wayne. Despite being well into his 70s, he encouraged us to really<em> </em>hit him during the fight scene. So we did.</p> <p>The reaction to the film was extraordinary. George Romero loved it and I saw a picture of Stephen King wearing a Shaun of the Dead T-shirt. I\u2019d made it on to the chest of a horror master. </p>",
  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/mar/02/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/apr/27/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from the last week.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the great Barbara Pym. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/102371558\">MachenBach</a> recommends The Sweet Dove Died:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a bit of an outlier in Pym\u2019s oeuvre, I think. There are no anthropologists, vicars or church hall bazaars, and it\u2019s considerably less comic than most of her novels. But, despite that (and at the risk of incurring the wrath of her aficionados), I think it may actually be one of her very best.</p> <p>It centres on Leonora Eyre, an attractive, beautifully-dressed single woman in (latish?) middle age, who is also a pretty undilutedly horrible individual: she looks down on almost everyone, is a terrific snob and racist, and incredibly vain \u2026 Leonora is a fantastic portrait of ageing and self-deluding vanity, caught in the position of needing to be wanted, whilst also, impossibly, priding herself on her independence from others. The book\u2019s concern is to bring this slowly, painfully and tragic-comically to her attention and ours. And it does this very well.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Pym\u2019s Excellent Women, says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14992181\">interwar</a>, is \u2013 wait for it \u2013 \u201cexcellent\u201d:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Deft sketches of a multitude of characters who may appear only in one scene, or sporadically as minor voices in others \u2013 the outspoken Sister Blatt, the manipulative widow Allegra Gray, the vicar\u2019s na\u00efve sister Winifred, the crazy Mrs Bone \u2013 Pym\u2019s mastery of the defining voice is up there with Dickens \u2013 keep the pace moving and the smiles coming. But there is also something more serious going on in its revelation of what it is to be an intelligent and capable, but also conventional, unmarried woman, with all the fuss of that era about what hat or lipstick to be seen in, and the pressure to be selfless \u2013 as literally as possible \u2013 in an increasingly selfish social environment. Mildred is a superb anthropologist of her own tight little world.</p> </blockquote> <p>HG Wells\u2019 Kipps has helped bring back <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13035061\">BobHammond2</a>\u2019s reading mojo:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Like many, I\u2019ve been struggling to read over the last month. I went from racing through a book a week earlier in the year to taking four weeks to get through Kipps by HG Wells. That\u2019s no reflection on Wells\u2019 rags-to-riches story - when I finally got going with it I found it very enjoyable, packed full of themes such as social class and the desire for self improvement, an engaging central character in Kipps and the underlying twists and turns of his romance with first love Ann. The only thing I found slightly strange was that in my mind the story should have finished about three quarters of the way through - it would have been a tidy conclusion at that stage. But then it throws up another set of challenges for Kipps to overcome, before there\u2019s a final - and very appropriate - ending. A great book, though, and I\u2019m looking forward to checking out some of Wells\u2019 other social novels. Kipps, and The History of Mr Polly (which I also enjoyed), shows there\u2019s more to him than the famous science fiction novels.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13072920\">bindithecat</a> makes Gregg Hurwitz\u2019s Orphan X series sound like the tonic we all need :</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Anyone who enjoys thrillers and is in need of some escapism from the dreaded virus, should try Hurwitz\u2019s Orphan X series of books. I just finished Hellbent and it was a thriller from start to finish. Of course it\u2019s all very high tech weaponry and tracking the bad guys but somehow the good guy comes out on top. Of course it\u2019s a little implausible that one man can do so much damage but that\u2019s the beauty of it. I really recommend them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jonathan Coe\u2019s What A Carve Up has brought solace to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16887671\">booklooker</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I suppose my idea of what constitutes a \u201ccomforting reread\u201d might seem a tad strange, but I am off with Jonathan Coe\u2019s <em>What a Carve Up!</em>. I am very happy to be with a nasty cast and surreal events that, to me, no longer hold surprises. Makes quite a change to the news.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019m reading The Gift Of Rain by Tan Twan Eng,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10095272\">jaya06</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s almost like someone is forcing me to calm down and meditate. I love the Penang setting and the leisurely pace. War is on the horizon and ominousness is in the air, at odds with the self-control Philip Hutton is learning, and the tension is gripping.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Allure Of The Archives by Arlette Farge has fascinated <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/100520245\">AbsoluteBeginner76</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is a beautiful slim work on the art of archival research, translated in a very readable flowing style as she consults records of pre-court hearings in the Arsenal Library, Paris. She laments that these people, whose short criminal interactions have been recorded, remain anonymous at the end of the research.... She describes the act of copying these sources by hand, in long sessions, chilled by the cold air of the archives. Not sure if this is still done but can you imagine, writing by hand, 25 dry pre-court hearing documents, inventory lists etc. Fascinating.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4187061\">FreethoughtRules</a> finished The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton over the weekend:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I really loved it. I was pleasantly surprised because I\u2019m not a fan of the 1993 film adaptation so it was quite a risk reading it in the first place! It made me laugh a lot but it also made me sad and frustrated at how many of us live a half-life, never really being who we are or doing what we truly want with our lives through fear of social disapproval or rejection. I thought the ending was perfect.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17762458\">SDiviani</a> recommends (almost) the entire oeuvre of the mighty Iris Murdoch:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I wanted to read a writer whose novels create a convincing and habitable world, with a cast of vivid, fascinating characters engaged in compelling goings-on, so that however stressed and down I might be at times I can forget everything and wallow in their lives. Hello Iris Murdoch. Her novels satisfy all of the above and the big plus is that she wrote 25 of them.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is most certainly a big plus.</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqIbEHNqbPs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">This is the rap version of Fox In Sox by Dr Seuss</a>.

  "<p>Coronavirus has hit Spain hard and its residents have endured the strictest lockdown of any country in Europe. Outside activity was banned, unless it was for going to work or visiting the local supermarket for essentials (only one member of the household at a time). The Guardia Civil<em> </em>rigorously enforced the law: roadblocks stopped cars, IDs, till receipts and distances travelled all checked. Illicit visitors to my local beach were reprimanded and heavily fined. Along the promenade in the village of San Luis de Sabinillas, on the Costa del Sol, the outdoor gyms, <em>petanca</em> courts and children\u2019s playgrounds have lain empty, cordoned off by police tape.</p> <p>Throughout the winter, I cooled my menopausal flushes in the Mediterranean. Recently I\u2019ve dreamed of clandestine nocturnal dips, but the threat of a \u20ac500 fine has chilled my ardour. I made do with workout videos and online <em>parch\u00eds</em> (Spanish ludo) with my mum.</p> <p>Spain is all about socialising, sitting outside till late, having fun, making noise. Children are to be seen <em>and</em> heard. For the first six weeks of the lockdown, the only human life I observed on the streets was from scurrying, paranoid, masked adults. On 26 April, Spanish children were freed from captivity, bringing optimism, energy and joyful noise. Last weekend was the turn of the adults. I planned yoga on the beach, then a socially distanced swim. As with many others, I\u2019d been counting the days. At sunrise on Saturday morning, runners, walkers and cyclists began to arrive at the beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da27305535f2b662fd8016a205684a85fb5143ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da27305535f2b662fd8016a205684a85fb5143ec/0_191_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie Evangelista: \u2018Being allowed to run means being able to breathe again\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie Evangelista: \u2018Being allowed to run means being able to breathe again\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Weller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cRunning is my means of self-care,\u201d said Lizzie Evangelista, a lecturer and psychotherapist. \u201cI\u2019m an ultra-distance runner: 190km, or longer, through jungles and deserts. It\u2019s a big deal for me. Being allowed to run means being able to breathe again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLack of exercise affects your mood,\u201d said her husband, Jo. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been sitting with duct tape around me, not able to do anything to lift my mood. I cycled up into the hills this morning. It was amazing. I could smell the herbs and flowers. Normally, I go as far and as fast as possible, but today I took things slowly, I wanted to savour the moment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMentally oxygenated,\u201d was how Elena, 51, described herself after her first sea swim since lockdown. Elena regularly takes part in races along the Mediterranean coast. She explained that, as the owner of an ironmongers\u2019 shop, she has been badly hit economically, but she has enjoyed being at home and spending time with her daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve really missed the social aspect of swimming \u2013 I love being part of a group; the fun and laughter, the friendship. I felt a little nervous swimming on my own today and being in a wetsuit was tiring for the first five minutes, but I soon got into the rhythm. I feel great now that I\u2019ve been back in the sea.\u201d</p> <p>Marisa was more conflicted: \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to swimming, but feeling a bit unsure about coming out and facing the world with the virus still around. It was wonderful being in the water though \u2013 a real tonic.\u201d</p> <p>Twins Lola and Angela, 65, celebrated their freedom by walking and dancing on the beach. \u201cMy soul is dancing,\u201d Lola exclaimed. \u201cI am free and I\u2019ve realised that we don\u2019t appreciate what we\u2019ve got until we lose it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4911cf63d920defc367d8d2cb5999ca78e2401f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4911cf63d920defc367d8d2cb5999ca78e2401f6/0_0_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diego and Francis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diego and Francis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Weller</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Diego Fernandez, a retired doctor who has been volunteering since the outbreak of the virus, took the opportunity to get back on his bike with his friend Francis, 66. \u201cI worry that we will stop being so affectionate, which is part of the character of Andaluc\u00eda. I saw my six-year-old grandson but I couldn\u2019t hug him.\u201d</p> <p>At 8am, I was doing yoga on the beach, warming up for a big swim. Tentatively, I dipped my toes in the water. Despite the spring sunshine, the sea was cold. As always, I took a deep breath and threw myself in, letting out an exhilarated gasp of delight. For 15 minutes I left the world\u2019s cares and the confinement of the last 48 days behind me.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Lola Culs\u00e1n is </em><em>co-author of <a href=\"http://www.wildthingspublishing.com/product/wild-swimming-spain/\">Wild Swimming Spain</a> (Wild Things Publishing, \u00a315.99)</em></p>",
  "<p>As individuals, families, industries and nations plot their course through this pandemic, there is a painful truth that is yet to be properly acknowledged. The Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 and the resulting global recession \u2013 is going to have a devastating and destabilising effect in the world\u2019s poorest countries.</p> <p>In response, wealthy countries and international financial institutions will need to fundamentally shift their approach to aid and debt. This cannot be business as usual. Extraordinary measures are needed to tackle the extraordinary problem we face.</p> <p>For rich countries, that will mean a one-off increase in the amount they spend on foreign aid. For the international financial institutions it means changing their lending terms. The alternative is dealing with the spill-over effects for many years to come. That would prove even more painful, and much more expensive. For everyone.</p> <p>There are many things we do not know about coronavirus, but it is possible to assess some of the costs of the necessary response in the poorest countries, and how they can be met.</p> <p>We face the biggest economic slowdown in living memory. The International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization both predict <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\">the global economy will get 3% </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\">smaller this year.</a> That would make theGreat Lockdown the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p> <p>In the poorest countries we should be ready for a rise in conflict, hunger and poverty. The spectre of multiple famines looms. We can already see economies contracting as export earnings, remittances and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/covid-19-throws-europes-tourism-industry-into-chaos\">tourism</a> disappear. As countries with weak health systems attempt to fight the virus, we can expect an increase in measles, malaria, cholera and other disease as vaccinations are put on hold, health systems buckle under the strain and medical supply chains are disrupted.</p> <p>Our best estimate is that the cost of protecting the most vulnerable 10% of people in the world\u2019s poorest countries from the very worst impacts of the pandemic is approximately $90bn (about \u00a373bn). This is a lot of money. But it is an affordable sum, equivalent to just 1% of the <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-27/g20-leaders-global-economy-fight-coronavirus/12091530\">global stimulus package</a> the world\u2019s richest countries have put in place to save the global economy.</p> <p>About two-thirds of it could come from organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. They will need support to change the terms on which they help the most vulnerable countries: front-loading money, reduced interest rates and further debt relief.</p> <p>The remainder will need to come from \u201cofficial development assistance\u201d \u2013 the money wealthy countries spend on foreign aid. That currently stands at about $150bn each year.

These are countries where many people are losing their freedoms, their jobs and their loved ones and countries making significant sacrifices while facing an uncertain future.

That is not my experience. In less than two years after the financial crisis of 2008, fundraising for UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals had increased by more than 40%. That was a result of human generosity and empathy \u2013 but also a calculation of national interest in the donor countries.</p> <p>Recent history shows us that what happens in the world\u2019s most fragile places has knock-on effects, whether it\u2019s through uncontrolled migration, terrorism or global instability.

Nor is economic collapse and instability in the poorest nations.</p> <p>In a week in which people in some parts of the world have been given cause for optimism, we have seen how the extraordinary actions of individuals can change the trajectory for a whole nation.

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d says Emily Atkin, not sounding very apologetic, \u201cbut if you still refuse to see parallels between climate change and coronavirus then honestly you\u2019re just stupid.\u201d</p> <p>A few weeks ago, the 30-year-old journalist wasn\u2019t feeling so confrontational. Less was known about the global pandemic; the data and scientific research showing how the two global crises are linked was not as clear is it is today. But the connections quickly became obvious to Atkin, founder of the climate newsletter and podcast Heated. \u201cBoth are global crises which threaten millions of lives with clear science on how to solve them which governments have been too slow to act on; the same people who promote climate denial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/climate-science-deniers-downplaying-coronavirus-pandemic\">are refusing to accept the science of coronavirus</a>, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a10d6246438033bb48d141b08909b8b0fd251491\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a10d6246438033bb48d141b08909b8b0fd251491/0_231_2250_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Atkin, a former reporter at New Republic, launched Heated, a climate-focused newsletter and podcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Atkin, a former reporter at New Republic, launched Heated, a climate-focused newsletter and podcast</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cCoronavirus makes climate change worse, and vice versa,\u201d Atkin says from isolation in her apartment. \u201cWe can\u2019t do our research on climate because of it, we\u2019ve had to cancel the UN climate summit for international negotiations.\u201d Meanwhile, Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/trump-pollution-laws-epa-allows-companies-pollute-without-penalty-during-coronavirus\">loosened existing emission regulations</a> during the pandemic, yet studies are already finding that death rates are \u201csignificantly higher\u201d in areas with worse air pollution levels. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/halt-destruction-nature-worse-pandemics-top-scientists\">destruction of biodiversity makes pandemics more likely</a>. And just like with the impact of global heating, , the coronavirus is hitting black, brown and poor people the worst.</p> <p>The two things are so connected, Atkin repeats, that it\u2019s stupid to say they\u2019re not.</p> <p>Raised in New York and based in Washington DC, Atkin started reporting on the climate in 2013 after graduating in journalism from SUNY (the State University of New York) but three years in she was burnt out. \u201cI was forced to write in this really straight way with no emotion, just fact,\u201d she says of her time spent at the now closed liberal news site ThinkProgress and then a more conservative TV network. \u201cWe ran stories which focused on \u2018balance\u2019 in a bid not to alienate audiences.\u201d When facts were presented, it was to be done without emotion: the science shows we\u2019ll kill people if we don\u2019t do anything, we\u2019re not doing anything, end report.</p> <p>Climate-change deniers were also being given airtime on TV segments she was producing. She recalls being asked to rerecord a voiceover because she sounded \u201ctoo judgmental\u201d when stating what had been said by an interviewee wasn\u2019t scientifically correct. And, with editors regularly giving science and opinion equal value, all too often Atkin felt she was doing a disservice to her beat.</p> <p>\u201cI thought back to my journalism classes and how we were taught the first rule in the Society of Professional Journalists\u2019 code of ethics is to seek truth and report it.\u201d Atkin came to the realisation that when it comes to the climate crisis, showing what is true requires more than facts alone.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is full of emotions, money and power,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about people dying while others profit, the impact on lives and culture and jobs.\u201d Atkin had told the climate story again and again but felt she was making little impact. \u201cIt seemed so irresponsible for me to be working as a journalist\u2026 without being explicit about what will happen if we don\u2019t lower carbon emissions, and fast.\u201d</p> <p>And so in September last year she left her reporting job at New Republic and launched Heated: a climate-focused newsletter which aimed at speaking directly to an ever-growing, but under-served, environmentally-conscious audience. Atkin quickly found launching her own platform didn\u2019t just offer her editorial freedom, but her more emotive and in-depth output was giving her subscribers more confidence to talk all things climate in their daily lives.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had so many emails from readers telling me how before Heated the idea of speaking abut climate change to friends, family and colleagues made them anxious,\u201d says Atkin. \u201cSocial science shows the best thing we can do as individuals on climate change is to speak about it, but it\u2019s so controversial in the US that many people felt if difficult questions were asked they wouldn\u2019t be prepared.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bef2504a6b3d64610d2d6f6e9a032083d7c6400f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bef2504a6b3d64610d2d6f6e9a032083d7c6400f/0_0_5353_3569/1000.jpg\" alt=\"'We're all in this together' painted on to a boarded-up bar in New York City\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boarded-up bar on the Upper East Side of New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Dee Delgado/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her paying subscribers have an expectation of regularly delivered content, and when the pandemic worsened she was struggling to write about the relationship between coronavirus and the climate crisis in a coherent and digestible way. \u201cIf I do a podcast, I thought, I could work it out as we go along by talking to really smart people,\u201d she says. The moment matched the medium, and the Heated podcast was quickly launched.</p> <p>She has interviewed the veteran US environmentalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/fossil-fuel-industry-stop-the-money-pipeline\">Bill McKibben</a>, Harvard\u2019s interim director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment Dr Aaron Bernstein, and a host of her fellow climate journalists. Her response to Planet of the Humans, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/28/climate-dangerous-documentary-planet-of-the-humans-michael-moore-taken-down\">Michael Moore\u2019s controversial climate documentary</a> (\u201ca bad faith insult to all the work climate and energy scholars, journalists and activists have done in the last ten years\u201d) makes compelling listening.</p> <p>The first episode, however, opens with Atkin offering her own realisation: that living through the coronavirus has changed her thinking on whether individual action on climate, rather than only big business, politicians and the world\u2019s most powerful, has a significant role to play.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day now I take an individual action to help protect people: staying at home, wearing a mask, sanitising my hands, avoiding my friends and family,\u201d says Atkin. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not just to protect people physically, but to show everyone around me that I care about this problem too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Seeing how quickly most of us have adapted our lives to respond to the Covid-19 crisis and encouraged our peers to follow has been a lesson in the potential of virtue-signalling.

When the newsletter started there was momentum behind a Green New Deal, a host of candidates with different climate policies fighting it out in the democratic primary, and climate change forums being broadcast on network TV.</p> <p>\u201cFocus has always been climate change\u2019s number one problem,\u201d says Atkin. \u201cJournalists aren\u2019t willing to cover it properly, people don\u2019t want to to talk about, politicians with vested interests can\u2019t be bothered.\u201d It\u2019s a crisis in prioritisation, and the coronavirus has certainly sapped momentum from the movement.</p> <p>The relative speed at which states have moved on the coronavirus compared to inaction on the long-running climate catastrophe front has also confirmed one of Atkin\u2019s greatest fears: that we live in societies so focused on the short-term that we wait to see the worst happening with our own eyes before we act on it. She isn\u2019t optimistic about that changing any time soon, so that\u2019s where Heated fits into her thinking.</p> <p>\u201dI see my responsibility as documenting the short-term effects of climate change more aggressively so people understand, just like coronavirus, climate change is killing people right now,\u201d she says. Some, Atkin says, might think this make her an activist. \u201cBut I think it simply makes me someone who cares about human life, which is a basic tenet of journalism.\u201d </p> <p>Far from being irresponsible to talk about the climate during the coronavirus crisis, as Atkin puts it: it\u2019s irresponsible not to.</p>",

  "<p>The death of a cleaner who worked at the Ministry of Justice has raised serious questions around the treatment of outsourced workers who do not receive occupational sick pay.</p> <p>United Voices of the World (UVW), the trade union, said it was concerned that its member Emanuel Gomes, from Guinea Bissau, had continued to work in near-empty offices for about five days with suspected coronavirus symptoms because he believed he could not afford to lose income.</p> <p>He died on 24 April after being taken home by a colleague who was among those worried about his feverish symptoms and loss of appetite. A maintenance worker at the MoJ believed to be from Pakistan also died during that week, with the circumstances around his death unclear.</p> <p>Fearing that they were putting themselves at risk of contracting coronavirus, several cleaners refused to go to work at the MoJ\u2019s 14-storey headquarters in central London on Tuesday after the deaths, according to UVW.</p> <p>One of the cleaners was allegedly suspended later after criticising the response of OCS, the cleaning company, to coronavirus concerns following the death of Gomes. OCS did not comment on this specific point.</p> <p>The vast majority of civil servants are working from home but the cleaners \u2013 designated key workers \u2013 have purportedly been told to work in groups of two or three at the building.</p> <p>They have complained of not being provided with masks and having to commute to Westminster during peak times for their shifts.</p> <p>The cleaners, who are paid \u00a39.08 an hour, had been split into two groups to work on alternate days to limit the number of people on-site simultaneously but were back on the normal rota on 15 April, according to UVW, but OCS challenged this version of events.</p> <p>Fatima Djalo, an 55-year-old cleaner from Guinea Bissau, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no work to do. The buildings are empty. But we can\u2019t go home and we have to stay here if we want to get paid and pay our bills.</p> <p>\u201cThe bosses have fled, they\u2019re not here. Two colleagues died last week. We\u2019re trapped and we\u2019re really scared. Some people are shaking with fear.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos Alberto, a 61-year-old cleaner from Brazil, said he was off work from 18 March to 19 April with suspected coronavirus and had been told he would only receive statutory sick pay of about \u00a3420.</p> <p>The MoJ has not been notified of any cleaners testing positive for coronavirus nor dying from it. OCS, which employs the outsourced cleaning staff, said it has no details about the cause of Gomes\u2019s death \u2013 he was thought to be in his 60s and had worked at the MoJ since February 2018.</p> <p>Kier, the company which provides maintenance staff, did not provide any details but confirmed its workers receive occupational sick pay.</p> <p>UVW said it suspects coronavirus was the cause of both deaths, and that about 70 security, maintenance and cleaning staff normally work at the MoJ.</p> <p>Petros Elia, a UVW representative, said: \u201cThe death of our member Emanuel is a tragedy. In the hours before his death he became so ill he was delirious with fever and on the brink of physical collapse. However, instead of seeking medical support or simply resting at home, he had continued to drag himself into work at the MoJ.\u201d</p> <p>He questioned why the cleaners have been told to continue to work at the near empty, \u201cbarely operational\u201d building despite the risk to themselves and their families.</p> <p>\u201cIt is also utterly hypocritical of the government to simultaneously insist on lockdown and social distancing whilst instructing its cleaners to unnecessarily continue to work,\u201d Elia added.</p> <p>An OCS spokesperson said: \u201cSadly, we can confirm an OCS colleague passed away at home last week, having been taken ill suddenly. At this stage, we have no details about his cause of death. Our deepest sympathies are with his family, friends and colleagues at this time.\u201d</p> <p>OCS said protective equipment including rubber gloves and aprons had been provided to cleaning staff but that masks were not required to be used, in line with Public Health England guidelines.</p> <p>Asked if OCS provides occupational sick pay, the spokesperson said that staff would receive \u201csick pay\u201d \u2013 believed to be the statutory \u00a396 a week, the legal minimum \u2013 \u201cfor any periods of sickness absence of self-isolation where working from home is not possible.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cShift patterns were adjusted initially to allow colleagues to travel to and from work outside rush-hour. However, in response to colleague requests, and in recognition that colleagues often have more than one job, the shift pattern was reverted to the usual working day pattern.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is understood that Kier had provided vehicles so public transport could be avoided.

North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. There are currently 3,523,121 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,752 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2><strong>US officials believe China hid virus</strong><strong>\u2019s severity to hoard medical supplies</strong></h2> <p>An intelligence report by the US Department of Homeland Security, obtained by the Associated Press, claims China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/trump-very-confident-of-covid-19-vaccine-in-2020-and-predicts-up-to-100000-us-deaths\">covered up the extent of the coronavirus</a> outbreak and how contagious the disease is in order to stock up on the medical supplies needed to respond to it. Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page report dated 1 May. The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, saying on Sunday that the country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.</p> <h2>Global summit hopes to raise $8.2bn for coronavirus vaccine</h2> <p>A global alliance of world leaders is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (\u00a36.5bn) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/global-summit-hopes-to-raise-82bn-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">at a virtual summit on Monday</a> to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them.</p> <h2><strong>Japan extends the country\u2019s national state of emergency to 31 May</strong></h2> <p>Japan\u2019s<strong> </strong>prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Monday he had decided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/japan-to-extend-state-of-emergency-covid-19-amid-fears-second-wave-could-cripple-tokyo-hospitals\">to extend the country\u2019s national state of emergency</a> to 31 May.

  "<p>En las pr\u00f3ximas semanas, se esclarecer\u00e1 si el mundo vuelve a los combustibles f\u00f3siles tras la pandemia o si da un paso adelante hacia una econom\u00eda limpia, mientras el FMI (Fondo Monetario Internacional) y <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina\">Argentina</a> deciden si van a continuar ofreciendo su apoyo a los inmensos yacimientos de petr\u00f3leo y gas de Vaca Muerta, en Patagonia.</p> <p>El objetivo del proyecto es explotar el segundo dep\u00f3sito m\u00e1s grande de esquisto del planeta (despu\u00e9s de la Cuenca P\u00e9rmica, en Texas), pero su futuro es incierto debido al confinamiento forzoso provocado por COVID-19, que ha causado el descenso m\u00e1s dr\u00e1stico en el precio del crudo de los \u00faltimos treinta a\u00f1os.</p> <p>Los analistas afirman que, en t\u00e9rminos econ\u00f3micos, Vaca Muerta est\u00e1 ahora entre los proyectos de combustibles f\u00f3siles m\u00e1s vulnerables del mundo. Los activistas contra el cambio clim\u00e1tico creen que podr\u00eda ser uno de los primeros lugares donde se tome la decisi\u00f3n de \u201c<em>keep it in the ground\u201d</em> \u2013 es decir, dejar que permanezcan en el suelo.</p> <p>El gobierno argentino coloc\u00f3 el proyecto en un limbo la semana pasada, cuando el Ministro de Desarrollo Productivo, Mat\u00edas Kulfas, habl\u00f3 de Vaca Muerta como \u201ctema que va a tener que esperar\u201d hasta despu\u00e9s de la crisis. El mes pasado, el presidente de la compa\u00f1\u00eda nacional de petr\u00f3leo argentina YPF <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dead-cow-oil-play-set-155931929.html\">afirm\u00f3</a> que el colapso del precio del petr\u00f3leo iba a poner en cuesti\u00f3n toda la producci\u00f3n argentina de petr\u00f3leo.</p> <p>Como est\u00e1 ocurriendo en todo el mundo, todas las decisiones importantes se han pospuesto. El FMI va a jugar un papel crucial en la decisi\u00f3n sobre el futuro del proyecto, m\u00e1s que cualquier otro pa\u00eds, lo cual mandar\u00e1 una se\u00f1al firme sobre la postura de las instituciones internacionales a la hora de dar forma al mundo tras la pandemia.</p> <p>Hace dos a\u00f1os, el FMI realiz\u00f3 su pr\u00e9stamo m\u00e1s elevado de la historia para ayudar a Argentina a superar una crisis de la deuda que a\u00fan contin\u00faa hoy en d\u00eda. El organismo est\u00e1 trabajando en una nueva reestructuraci\u00f3n de los pasivos argentinos, y realizar\u00e1 este mes su revisi\u00f3n anual, que incluir\u00e1 un informe sobre Vaca Muerta.</p> <p>Inicialmente, el FMI promocion\u00f3 este proyecto para que Argentina recibiera divisas extranjeras y fuera m\u00e1s independiente en materia energ\u00e9tica. Pero con la presi\u00f3n creciente por parte de las instituciones internacionales hacia el alejamiento de los combustibles f\u00f3siles, el organismo insisti\u00f3 el a\u00f1o pasado en que Argentina recortase los subsidios para Vaca Muerta. Incluso antes del inicio de la pandemia, estos eran potencialmente catastr\u00f3ficos. El gobierno argentino ha tenido que atraer con miles de millones de d\u00f3lares en subsidios a compa\u00f1\u00edas petrol\u00edferas extranjeras, incluyendo a Chevron, Shell, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips y Pan American Energy (una subsidiaria de BP, British Petroleum). </p> <p>Sin este apoyo econ\u00f3mico, los proyectos no podr\u00edan sostenerse econ\u00f3micamente \u2013 incluso si el precio del petr\u00f3leo fuera mucho mayor que el actual, $20 el barril. La regi\u00f3n es demasiado remota, la infraestructura de transporte, d\u00e9bil; y la demanda local, pobre. El proyecto tambi\u00e9n se enfrenta a una oposici\u00f3n feroz por parte de la comunidad ind\u00edgena Mapuche, que afirma que les ha sido robado su territorio y que ha sido contaminado para beneficio de los extranjeros. Todo ello ha contribuido a convertirlo en uno de los proyectos de combustibles f\u00f3siles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/14/indigenous-mapuche-argentina-fracking-communities\">m\u00e1s caros y pol\u00e9micos</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7544779e8a304c792c2e9dbc3d5d90583ac92c25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7544779e8a304c792c2e9dbc3d5d90583ac92c25/0_570_8516_5108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mapuche indigenous spokeswoman Lorena Bravo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lorena Bravo, portavoz de la comunidad Mapuche, denuncia que su entorno ha sido contaminado</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emiliano Lasalvia/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>El confinamiento ha supuesto otro golpe. \u201cLa hist\u00f3rica bajada de precios de crudo es otra se\u00f1al de la inviabilidad de Vaca Muerta\u201d, ha dicho Fernando Cabrera, del Observatorio Petrolero Sur, una organizaci\u00f3n independiente de la provincia de Neuqu\u00e9n. \u201cHace mucho que advertimos que existe una falta de infraestructura esencial para la exportaci\u00f3n, que hay una demanda global d\u00e9bil y una dependencia extrema de subsidios que la Argentina no puede costear debido a su crisis de la deuda. La pandemia empeora la situaci\u00f3n.\u201d</p> <p>Los ejecutivos petroleros argentinos veteranos, conocidos en la industria como \u201clos viejos petroleros\u201d, est\u00e1n presionando al gobierno para que siga adelante con los planes de Vaca Muerta, inflar el precio del petr\u00f3leo dentro del pa\u00eds y pasar el coste a los conductores de las estaciones de servicio. \u201cEn esta industria hay que hacer lo que nadie hace. No hay que ir tras la manada, <a href=\"https://www.mejorinformado.com/plus-energtico/2020/4/26/vaca-muerta-no-hay-que-ir-detras-de-la-manada-62248.html\">escribi\u00f3 Jos\u00e9 Luis Sureda</a>, ex-Secretario de Recursos de Hidrocarbono del Gobierno. Pero el gobierno est\u00e1 atado de pies y manos por falta de dinero.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo hay duda de que la demanda y la baja de precios est\u00e1n interrumpiendo los planes de expansi\u00f3n del gobierno argentino a corto plazo\u201d, coment\u00f3 Lorne Stockman, principal analista de investigaci\u00f3n de <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/29/www.priceofoil.org\">Oil Change International</a>, a\u00f1adiendo que esto formaba parte de una tendencia global. Es muy probable que docenas de proyectos de petr\u00f3leo y gas se vean desechados o sean pospuestos indefinidamente, incluyendo tres centrales de gas natural l\u00edquido en Brownsville, Texas, y muchas terminales petrol\u00edferas mar\u00edtimas americanas. Las arenas bituminosas canadienses, los pozos petrol\u00edferos mar\u00edtimos brasile\u00f1os y los proyectos de perforaci\u00f3n en Guyana lo tendr\u00e1n dif\u00edcil para producir con un margen de rentabilidad.</p> <p>A $35 el barril, el 4% del suministro del petr\u00f3leo existente se convierte en una oferta poco viable econ\u00f3micamente, seg\u00fan un <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/feature/how-will-the-oil-price-crash-hit-the-upstream-sector/\">estudio reciente</a> llevado a cabo por Wood Mackenzie, analistas de la industria energ\u00e9tica. Si los valores descienden por debajo de $25, como lo han hecho en los Estados Unidos, este porcentaje de p\u00e9rdidas asciende a 9%, el equivalente a diez millones de barriles diarios.</p> <p>La situaci\u00f3n es a\u00fan m\u00e1s dura para proyectos nuevos de petr\u00f3leo y gas. A $35 el barril, el 75% de nuevos proyectos de petr\u00f3leo y gas no alcanza a cubrir sus costos financieros. Desde el inicio de la pandemia, las principales compa\u00f1\u00edas petroleras del mundo han <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/news/feature/how-will-the-oil-price-crash-hit-the-upstream-sector/\">reducido sus inversiones de capital en casi $25 mil millones</a>. Esto significa que va a ser muy dif\u00edcil que las compa\u00f1\u00edas alcancen sus previsiones de producci\u00f3n. El a\u00f1o pasado, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/10/oil-firms-barrels-markets\">el peri\u00f3dico The Guardian revel\u00f3</a> que las cincuenta mayores compa\u00f1\u00edas petrol\u00edferas del mundo ten\u00edan previsto llegar a generar siete millones de barriles diarios adicionales antes de 2030. Esto es mucho menos probable ahora.</p> <p>\u201cSi los precios no aumentan, es inevitable que los grifos se cierren\u201d, advierte el informe. \u201cDadas las dificultades y costes asociados al reinicio de una producci\u00f3n en declive, es posible que una proporci\u00f3n de ese suministro no se recupere nunca.\u201d</p> <p>Los niveles depender\u00e1n principalmente del liderazgo de los gobiernos, afirma Valentina Kretzschmar, Vicepresidente de Investigaci\u00f3n Corporativa en Wood Mackenzie. \u201cAl final, todo depende de la demanda. Si existe demanda de petr\u00f3leo, se producir\u00e1. No permanecer\u00e1 en el suelo\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cLa cuesti\u00f3n es la siguiente: \u00bfQu\u00e9 vamos a aprender de la crisis de Covid-19? \u00bfC\u00f3mo nos cambiar\u00e1? \u00bfC\u00f3mo reaccionar\u00e1n los gobiernos? La respuesta del gobierno tendr\u00e1 un impacto enorme en lo que suceda despu\u00e9s.\u201d</p> <p>El FMI anunci\u00f3 el a\u00f1o pasado que incorporar\u00eda los riesgos clim\u00e1ticos en las decisiones a tomar, lo cual podr\u00eda erosionar la ya escasa viabilidad de Vaca Muerta. Mar\u00eda Marta Di Paola, directora de investigaci\u00f3n de la Fundaci\u00f3n de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales de Argentina, dijo que el proyecto no cumpl\u00eda los requisitos del acuerdo clim\u00e1tico de Par\u00eds. \u201cSi el <em>fracking</em> de Vaca Muerta evolucionara tal y como se plane\u00f3 inicialmente, sus emisiones de carbono se <a href=\"http://ggon.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GGON_OilGasClimate_English_Dec2019-1.pdf\">cuadruplicar\u00edan</a> antes de llegar al a\u00f1o 2050\u201d, escribi\u00f3. </p> <p>Stockman inst\u00f3 al FMI, Argentina y otros gobiernos a apartarse de los combustibles f\u00f3siles en sus planes de est\u00edmulo econ\u00f3mico. M\u00e1s subvenciones, afirm\u00f3, simplemente contribuir\u00edan a establecer m\u00e1s ciclos de auge y depresi\u00f3n en el futuro. \u201cEn lugar de rescatar compa\u00f1\u00edas para proteger a sus ejecutivos y accionistas, los gobiernos deber\u00edan utilizar estos incentivos para apoyar la producci\u00f3n y demanda de energ\u00eda limpia y ayudar a los trabajadores en la transici\u00f3n. Eso no est\u00e1 sucediendo.\u201d </p> <p>Es cierto que muchos proyectos parecen inviables en la situaci\u00f3n actual, pero muy pocos est\u00e1n siendo eliminados si existe la posibilidad de un aumento de precios en tan s\u00f3lo un a\u00f1o. Una vez m\u00e1s, la ausencia de una normativa para guiar y gestionar la transici\u00f3n nos est\u00e1 fallando en el campo clim\u00e1tico, adem\u00e1s de en las \u00e1reas de igualdad y justicia, y en la prevenci\u00f3n de la pr\u00f3xima cat\u00e1strofe.</p>",
  "<p>When we talk to teachers who struggle to get good results with news writing, we always ask what their students have been writing about. Most often they\u2019ve been given tasks such as \u2018Report on a UFO landing in the school playground\u2019, or \u2018rewrite a fairytale in the style of a news report\u2019. (These would no doubt challenge many trained adult journalists!).</p> <p>However, we know that children are regularly exposed to real news, <a href=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/research-and-data/media-literacy-research/childrens/children-and-parents-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2019\">particularly online</a>. This news can feel exciting, worrying, sad, or heartwarming, but it never feels like a fairytale. Asking children to write \u2018fake news reports\u2019 can also be confusing when trying to teach them to be wary of \u2018fake news\u2019.</p> <p>At NewsWise we\u2019ve seen that when children are asked to write about real news events, they produce better writing. They are also much more motivated! Here are six top tips for turning your reluctant writers into news enthusiasts.</p> <h4><strong>1) Keep it real</strong></h4> <p>Get your students to write about real events in their school or local area, or encourage them to engage with global news.</p> <ul> <li><p>Ask children to report on something happening at school (a guest visitor, a new \u2018vegan lunch day\u2019 in the canteen), or a local issue (shops closing in the high street, a new park).</p></li> <li><p>Ask children to write about a local perspective on a national or international issue (coronavirus, climate change, Brexit).</p></li> <li><p>Plan opportunities for your students to conduct real interviews \u2013 they could talk to anyone from the head teacher to a local MP!</p></li> </ul> <p>This is also a great opportunity to teach children about the importance of considering both sides of a story, and understanding the difference between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2019/oct/07/lesson-7-identifying-the-difference-between-fact-and-opinion\">fact and opinion</a>. We\u2019ve even heard of our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2019/oct/07/lesson-8-producing-balanced-news-reports\">lesson on different viewpoints</a> being used to resolve playground football disputes!</p> <h4><strong>2) Keep it positive</strong></h4> <p>We are all exposed to a lot of negative news, particularly during the coronavirus crisis. Producing upbeat news reports can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2020/mar/21/wellbeing-and-the-news\">help children rebalance their world view</a> by becoming more aware of positive events. Our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Happy_News_Challenge\">Happy News activity</a> encourages children to script, report, and share their positive news.</p> <h4><strong>3) Create an authentic experience</strong></h4> <p>Why not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2018/sep/17/creating-a-newsroom-in-your-classroom\">transform your classroom into a newsroom</a>? Your students will gain team work, time-management, and critical thinking skills.</p> <p>There are plenty of free and easy ways to get that newsroom feel. Try getting your students to make their own press passes and a sign for the classroom door. Could you borrow some clocks and set them to different timezones? Make sure you assign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/series/roles-in-a-newsroom\">roles</a>. Who will subedit the reports? Who is in charge of design? Of course, you can act as chief editor!</p> <p>Set students short tasks with tight deadlines for an authentic newsroom experience. Teachers are often amazed that NewsWise students are able to critically assess reports, research and script a balanced news story from scratch and rehearse and perform a news bulletin, all within a couple of hours.</p> <h4><strong>4) Immerse students in news</strong></h4> <p>Many children cannot access news at home, <a href=\"https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/family-news-literacy-report/\">particularly those in disadvantaged areas</a>. How can we expect children to write in the style of news reports without exposure to news media? Remember that your classroom might be the only source of news for your students. Make time for them to watch, listen to, or read the news.</p> <p>Check out our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/2019/jan/18/child-friendly-news\">child-friendly news</a> page here for more ideas on bringing real, age-appropriate news into the classroom.</p> <h4><strong>5) Give pupils agency</strong></h4> <p>Children are more motivated to write if the topic interests them. NewsWise teachers who let children choose their own writing topics even reported children asking to continue working over lunchtime!</p> <p>Of course, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newswise/video/2018/nov/28/changing-the-world-for-the-better-katharine-viner-tells-us-about-her-role-video\">chief editor</a> of your newsroom, you can veto any topic you consider too risky. Every newsroom has an editorial meeting where story ideas are discussed and the best ideas are taken forward. Could you do the same?</p> <p>Empowering your pupils to report on real issues that matter to them will give them a unique voice in their school and community. As Roz, a teacher in London, told us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was watching them link what they were doing in class to wider issues outside our school community which I found the most gratifying. For me, so much of what NewsWise brings up in its delivery is to do with exploring what sort of person you want these children to become: compassionate, interested, resilient, critical, brave, truthful.</p> </blockquote> <h4><strong>6) Create a purpose</strong></h4> <p>Real news deserves a real audience. Get your students to create a school newspaper, take over the school newsletter for a week, or organise a presentation event for their families. You can even send your students\u2019 writing to NewsWise to feature on our website!</p> <p>We hope these tips inspire you to change the way you teach news writing at primary level. As Jess, a teacher in Slough, told us:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[NewsWise] was transformative in the way that we talk about and teach the news at Claycots; we now aim to ensure that children are learning about the purpose of news as well as being able to produce news stories that are real and trustworthy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p>Angie Pitt is Director of NewsWise, Victoria Baker is Critical literacy programme manager for NewsWise.

against misuse of data from the Covidsafe app. Criminal offences under the bill can be investigated by the Australian Federal Police. </p> \n   <p>Individuals can also have their complaints heard by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner or the relevant state or territory privacy regulator if appropriate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>More than 4 million people have now registered

  "<p>Employees could have to return to work with physical shields to separate them from colleagues, personal protective equipment (PPE) and limits on time spent close to each other, according to Ben Wallace, the defence secretary.</p> \n<p>In a round of broadcast interviews, Wallace said there was a range of measures that could be used in workplaces where maintaining a two-metre distance between colleagues is not possible.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson is preparing to set out on Sunday how restrictions can be eased but before that, business groups and trade unions have been sent draft guidelines for how to protect people if physical distancing rules cannot be adhered to.</p> \n<p>Wallace told the BBC that supermarket shoppers are not two metres from those working at the tills but are separated by physical shields. \u201cPotentially, shields or PPE is a way forward,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Wallace also highlighted the \u201cuse of time\u201d as another tool: \u201cYou could be closer than two metres but not for long,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He also confirmed the government is sourcing more face masks but stressed they should be distributed to key workers first and argued they make a marginal difference. </p> \n<p>According to a draft plan seen by the BBC, other workplace measures including reduced hot-desking and staggered shift times.</p> \n<p>The document urges employers to minimise the number of staff using equipment and maximise home working.

They (bosses) will want to know that they\u2019re not going to be held liable to horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they\u2019ve done everything in their power to keep their people safe.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhereas by contrast, you\u2019d want to see those employers who didn\u2019t take adequate steps face the consequences of that so the question of legal liability is extremely important.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rachel Reeves, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the public \u201cdeserve to be levelled with\u201d over a detailed plan for easing lockdown measures.</p> \n<p>She told BBC Breakfast: \u201cGovernment need to put in a range of measures \u2013 whether that is mass community testing, contact tracing, and also those things like potentially the face coverings.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cBut also I think the public who have overwhelmingly stuck by these very tough lockdown rules over the last few weeks deserve to be levelled with and also want some hope for the future, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re urging the government to give much more detail, and face masks are one part of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Monday, Johnson will tell an international conference the coronavirus vaccine is \u201cthe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes\u201d.

  "<p>Spring, in the days of lockdown, continues obliviously \u2013 and reminds us how we depend on the natural world. For anyone with the luck to have a garden, the varied consolations of even a small patch of land will be clearer than ever. Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s fascinating book, written before the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> crisis, brings indebtedness to nature into new focus and, during a time in which many of us are compelled by our phones and computers, extends the awareness \u2013 backed up by compendious and elegant research \u2013 of how mentally enriching it is to swap screen for green.</p> <p>Stuart-Smith is a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, married to celebrated garden designer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/10/gardens-great-plains-tom-stuart-smith\">Tom Stuart-Smith</a>. Their style of gardening is a sympathetic collaboration with nature, eschewing high-handed interventions. An early photograph \u2013 in 1988 \u2013 shows them surveying newly dug beds in their Hertfordshire garden. Nothing much is growing \u2013 apart from the baby in Sue Stuart-Smith\u2019s arms \u2013 and they are at a momentary standstill, lost in thought. The photo makes the point: gardens begin \u2013 and continue \u2013 in the mind.</p> <p>The book begins with the moving story of Stuart-Smith\u2019s grandfather, Ted, whose submarine ran aground in the Dardanelles in 1915 and who became a prisoner in Turkey\u2019s brutal camps. He returned a haunted wraith, wearing \u201ca battered old raincoat with a Turkish fez on his head\u201d. His fianc\u00e9e, Fanny, restored him with sips of soup \u2013 but it was gardening that rescued him for the long haul. Ted is the first of many in the book for whom mental illness is relieved by gardening. Nature, Stuart-Smith reminds us, neither rejects nor judges.</p> <p>As a young woman, she dismissed gardening as \u201coutdoor housework\u201d. Now, she reports on how a long gardening session can leave you \u201cfeeling dead on your feet but strangely renewed inside \u2013 both purged and re-energised, as if you have worked on yourself in the process\u2026. gardening catharsis.\u201d Gardening can help with grief and be a way of making peace with mortality. It is a \u201cmeeting place between our innermost, dream-infused selves and the real physical world\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He who tills a field, renders a better service to mankind than all the scribblers in Europe, wrote Voltaire</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The neutrality of nurturing plants positively affects those who have themselves received little care, and Stuart-Smith enlightens us by explaining how caring is neurologically important. She visits exceptional therapeutic gardens including the <a href=\"https://insightgardenprogram.org/\">Insight Garden</a> project at San Quentin jail, <a href=\"https://www.horatiosgarden.org.uk/\">Horatio\u2019s Garden</a> for spinal-injury patients at Salisbury hospital, and a vegetable garden for recovering addicts in San Patrignano, Italy. Plants are easier to deal with than people (even if they have their own ways of answering back).</p> <p>This is not a book of effusions. It is attractive because quietly considered. It encourages us to garden \u2013 but gentle push never comes to shove. Stuart-Smith suggests that gardening, throughout history, has been civilising and about reciprocity \u2013 a mix of dream and slog. And there is no shortage of thinkers to stake her arguments. Freud was an avid orchid lover and cherished his garden in West Hampstead. Jung said: \u201cWe all need nourishment for our psyche. It is impossible to find such nourishment in urban tenements without a patch of green or a blossoming tree\u201d, and Donald Winnicott recklessly climbed a tree towards the end of his life (to the alarm of his wife) to do some tree surgery and create a better view.</p> <p>Stuart-Smith satisfyingly expands on Voltaire\u2019s \u201c<em>Il faut cultiver n</em><em>otre jardin</em>\u201d. Rejecting conventional formality, Voltaire planted thousands of trees on his land in eastern France and asserted: \u201cI have only done one sensible thing in my life \u2013 cultivate the ground. He who tills a field, renders a better service to mankind than all the scribblers in Europe.\u201d Sue Stuart-Smith renders a very special service with this book. Let\u2019s hope it reaches not only the converted but those who need it most.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac0943e17c10001926208f8d8a682eda64fe4434\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac0943e17c10001926208f8d8a682eda64fe4434/0_385_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Elation comes in many forms\u2019: Isabel Hardman in London\u2019s Richmond Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Elation comes in many forms\u2019: Isabel Hardman in London\u2019s Richmond Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Natural Health Service</em> makes a robustly argued companion piece that has grown out of fragility \u2013 the work not of a psychiatrist but of a patient. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/isabelhardman\">Isabel Hardman</a>, assistant editor of the <em>Spectator</em>, has suffered from PTSD, been dogged by the Black Dog and had times when she has felt suicidal. In 2016, she knew something was wrong when words went on strike and \u201cobsessive, frightening thoughts settled like a parliament of rooks\u201d. It was, she has since discovered, the \u201cgreat outdoors which made me want to keep living\u201d. And while I wish she would not keep repeating \u201cthe great outdoors\u201d (a phrase that diminishes what it describes), there is no doubting the integrity of her experience.</p> <p>I respect her decision not to recount the terrible thing that happened to her, although it leaves one with a more than idle curiosity \u2013 knowing the details of an affliction can be part of assessing the cure. However, the book holds its own as an inquiry into nature as tonic. Elation comes in many forms: an unexpected orchid in a Glasgow car park, a shy kingfisher by the Thames, and Penny Black, a headstrong pony in Wimbledon. She writes about forest bathing and about walking, running and cold water swimming (she breaks the ice on the Serpentine \u2013 that most masochistic of life-affirmations).

  "<p>Knowing how to control the spread of coronavirus is not rocket science. But actually doing it has proved elusive and difficult for many governments across the world. When China first alerted the World Health Organization about a novel coronavirus on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">31 December</a>, the countdown began for countries to each prepare. Some, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, were scarred by their recent experiences with two other deadly coronaviruses, Mers and Sars, and so reacted quickly to the coming threat. Others, such as the UK and US, consumed with domestic political issues, watched and waited, anticipating that this new virus would be more similar to a bad flu strain.</p> <p>We are now almost four months into this pandemic, and the lessons that can be drawn from east Asian countries on how best to control this coronavirus and keep daily new cases as low as possible are clear. Eight aspects in particular stand out as important for governments to recognise as they navigate difficult choices ahead. They also provide a guide for what the public should be expecting of and demanding from their governments.</p> <p>The first is to aggressively identify where the virus is and break chains of transmission. This requires a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">test, trace, isolate</a>\u201d policy that involves mass community testing, tracing those who had been in contact in the previous week with any individual testing positive, and putting all of those individuals into a mandatory quarantine. Governments and local municipalities would have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">recruit and train foot soldiers</a> to carry this out.<strong> </strong>While testing itself is not a solution, it is a crucial part of a package of public health interventions needed to keep identifying clusters of infection and breaking these apart. Keeping daily cases low through this approach keeps the burden off hospitals and allows bare-bones economic and social activity to occur.</p> <p>The second is to protect health and social care workers who are most at risk from contracting the virus and who are exposed to high <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/why-do-some-young-people-die-of-coronavirus-covid-19-genes-viral-load\">viral loads</a> during the course of doing their jobs. This protection needs to involve not only priority access to testing, but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-doctors-finding-it-harder-to-get-ppe-kit-to-treat-covid-19-patients-research-reveals\">appropriate personal protective gear</a> that is readily available. Much attention has been paid to ensuring that there are enough ventilators, beds and oxygen and much less to the need for sufficient and skilled frontline staff, who cannot be manufactured in days or weeks.</p> <p>The third is to keep constant surveillance of the virus using tracking systems to detect whether certain parts of the country are becoming hotspots and whether sub-populations, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/singapore-million-migrant-workers-suffer-as-covid-19-surges-back\">migrants living in close quarters</a>, have a higher incidence of the virus. This can be done by building on existing flu surveillance networks and ensuring that data is shared in real time. Tied into this point is lesson four, which is about monitoring borders for imported cases. Travel bans towards certain countries have limited effectiveness, but blanket <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/new-zealand-tells-arrivals-to-self-isolate-for-two-weeks-including-citizens\">14-day quarantines</a> for any international arrivals can ensure that new cases are detected quickly rather than setting off more clusters of infections. </p> <p>The fifth is that clear and honest communication with the public is required to keep trust and compliance with the necessary policy guidance. This is an unsettling time for everyone as rules are introduced around daily behaviour and misinformation is rife. Therefore, consistent and straightforward messaging on why policies are being introduced and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/uk-to-name-scientific-advisers-on-emergency-coronavirus-group-sage\">transparency</a> on how governments are making their decisions is essential to create a beacon of trusted information in a sea of noise.</p> <p>The sixth is recognising that any \u201cexit\u201d strategy is not like a switch that means life will go back to pre-Covid days. A \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/boris-johnson-returns-to-no-10-and-a-government-under-pressure\">new normal</a>\u201d will need to be adjusted to, which is likely to involve distancing whenever possible; possible temperature checks when entering public buildings and offices; and the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/face-masks-mandatory-spread-coronavirus-government\">face masks in public</a>. The goal is to achieve some economic and social activity while keeping procedures in place that reduce the transmission of the virus.</p> <p>The seventh lesson is that lockdowns, if introduced early and quickly, can slow the spread of the virus, but are not a solution by themselves. They are a costly and crude policy instrument that should be used as sparingly as possible. They allow governments to buy time and use this time to massively increase important public health infrastructure. </p> <p>The final lesson is that all of the above are short-term strategies while countries await key scientific findings to create informed policy decisions and find the ultimate \u201cexit strategy\u201d. There are huge gaps in what we know about this virus, including about immunity, the individual risk of developing severe symptoms and how long it will take to develop an effective vaccine or therapy. But the steps above can ensure that countries keep daily new cases low and avoid a repeat of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/1918-flu-pandemic-coronavirus-drug-trials-scientists-treatments-evidence\">1918 flu pandemic</a>, which was determined, in the end, by the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</p>",
  "<p>A global alliance of world leaders is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (\u00a36.5bn) at a virtual summit on Monday to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them.</p> \n<p>National prestige and huge profits are potentially at stake for the countries and firms that win the race for a vaccine that can take the world\u2019s economies out of lockdown, but there is a risk of uncoordinated duplication of research efforts slowing the process and adding to the cost.</p> \n<p>Monday\u2019s fundraising summit comes after the concept was launched at a previous meeting on 24 April. Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the World Health Organization.</p> \n<p>The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, had been urged to support the summit. But optimism that the US might relent and join the initiative had waned by Monday morning.</p> \n<p>Melinda Gates, a critic of the absence of US leadership on global health, has warned: \u201cIf there is Covid anywhere, there is Covid everywhere. If vaccinations are not distributed everywhere, relapses can occur everywhere\u201d.</p> \n<p>The UK strongly supports the project and attended the 24 April event. Its prime minister Boris Johnson will tell the conference: \u201cThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It\u2019s humanity against the virus - we are in this together, and together we will prevail.\u201d</p> \n<p>The initiative is designed to broaden the work of an existing organisation, set up in 2017 in the wake of the Ebola outbreak, known as the Global Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations focused on vaccine research. The new body will have a remit to include testing and therapies for those with the disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The leaders hope to follow the model of the Global Vaccine and Immunisation Alliance (Gavi), which has negotiated with companies that develop vaccines for 20 years, lowering the price by guaranteeing long-term markets and large volumes. Gavi has helped fund the immunisation of 20 million children worldwide.</p> \n<p>A global pandemic board, operating independently, but in partnership with the World Health Organization, will have the support of the G20 group of countries. Separate subgroups will be set up to coordinate work on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. Sir Andrew Whitty, the former chief executive officer of GlaxoSmithKline, has agreed to be a special envoy for the group.</p> \n<p>The aim is to funnel research into five or six vaccines before moving towards mass manufacturing of the two that show the most promise. The WHO estimates as many as 89 vaccines are in development globally, including seven in clinical evaluation and some therapeutics in clinical trials. To hasten the process, the group aims to subsidise manufacture of drugs before final clinical trials are complete. The final costs could be as high as $40bn.</p> \n<p>The launch meeting last week agreed on the principles of Covid therapeutics research sharing and equitable distribution.</p> \n<p>A joint call for action that also backs the role of the WHO has been signed by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, French president, Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, European council, president Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European commission. All three EU national leaders have experienced a surge in popularity since the crisis started, but now face the difficulty of managing an easing of the lockdown without a ready vaccine.</p> \n<p>Their pre-summit joint statement says the aim is to \u201cbring together the world\u2019s best \u2013 and most prepared \u2013 minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again, while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Tech firms are in talks with ministers about creating health passports to help Britons return safely to work using coronavirus testing and facial recognition.</p> \n<p>Facial biometrics could be used to help provide a digital certificate \u2013 sometimes known as an immunity passport \u2013 proving which workers have had Covid-19, as a possible way of easing the impact on the economy and businesses from ongoing physical distancing even after current lockdown measures are eased.</p> \n<p>The UK-based firm Onfido, which specialises in verifying people\u2019s identities using facial biometrics, has delivered detailed plans to the government and is involved in a number of conversations about what could be rolled out across the country, it is understood.</p> \n<p>Its proposals, which have reached pilot stages in other countries, could be executed within months, it says. The firm could use antibody tests \u2013 proving whether someone has had the virus \u2013 or antigen tests, which show current infections.</p> \n<p>Digital identity experts say they are in the \u201cdiscovery stage\u201d of what could be tailored for the UK government, but developing a type of health certificate through app technology is gaining traction.</p> \n<p>The government is understood to be moving away from the phrase \u201cimmunity passport\u201d as evidence continues to emerge on exactly how immunity develops after someone has had Covid-19. The World Health Organization has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/who-warns-against-coronavirus-immunity-passports\">issued a stark warning</a> over attempts to give people false assurance through a passport scheme.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Boris Johnson will call on countries to come together in a \u201ctruly global effort\u201d to defeat the coronavirus as he co-hosts a virtual Coronavirus Global Response International Pledging Conference, and confirms the UK\u2019s promise of \u00a3388m funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments.<br><br>It comes ahead of the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">outlining a \u201croadmap\u201d out of lockdown</a>, including the need to tackle workers\u2019 fears of being in close proximity to others.</p> \n<p>Over the weekend, two firms made breakthroughs on developing antibody tests. The Swiss drugmaker Roche received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for a test they have developed, while Quotient, in Edinburgh, says its screening machines have capacity for up to 36,000 antibody tests a day and produce results in 35 minutes with 99.8% accuracy.</p> \n<p>These are lab-based tests, however, relying on blood to be taken by a medical professional and requiring large machines for analysis, taking time.</p> \n<p>The holy grail in antibody testing is a home pregnancy test-style kit that would provide almost instant results. So far none on the market, including 17.5m ordered by the government, have been demonstrated as sufficiently accurate. Typically these tests produce false negatives about half to 70% of the time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902YuSUZ1xW2uoR/\" data-alt=\"How the health passport works\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902YuSUZ1xW2uoR/\">How the health passport works</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Onfido, which is in talks with ministers, was founded by three former Oxford University students in 2012 and has worked with Monzo and Zipcar. It says it has the ability to roll out a system within months and could be the \u201clinchpin of the new normality\u201d and stimulating the economy.</p> \n<p>Their solution would embed Onfido technology within another organisation\u2019s app to establish someone\u2019s identity. The person would be asked to take a selfie and an image of their government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver\u2019s licence. The technology can determine whether the person\u2019s face matches their ID, and also if the ID is genuine. This creates a digital identity.</p> \n<p>They are then tested for coronavirus under a system endorsed by the government and the result is stored by another provider \u2013 in the UK this would most likely be the NHS. </p> \n<p>When the person goes to their workplace, they open the app, take a photo of their face and that unlocks a QR code. That QR code would be scanned by reception using simple camera technology and on their system they would see the test result and a photo of the employee\u2019s face for a short time, allowing them to visually determine the identity of the person in front of them.</p> \n<p>The only technology a business would need to make this work would be a camera to take an image of the QR code as they arrive. No information about someone\u2019s name, date of birth, address would be visible to the person on reception, only that they are fit to go into work.</p> \n<p>There are remaining questions about the extent to which the presence of antibodies in the blood ensures immunity. Early reports of apparent Covid-19 reinfections in South Korea now appear to have been explained by a combination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/03/coronavirus-reinfections-were-false-positives-says-who-technical-lead-video\">false negative results</a> and because the body\u2019s healing response can lead to infected cells from the lungs being expelled weeks after initial infection, causing people to test positive even though they are recovering.</p> \n<p>However, many experts still think it likely that immunity will wane over a period of months or years, potentially leaving people vulnerable \u2013 and some people could acquire more robust immunity than others.</p> \n<p>A government source said a form of certification system is \u201cstill on the table and being considered\u201d and that conversations around this concept fall under the government\u2019s \u201ctrack and trace\u201d plans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

When I was doing A-levels I went to the library instead, but you can\u2019t do that now. And there\u2019s a lot of us in one house, my family\u2019s quite big, so it\u2019s not somewhere I can get motivated for work.\u201d</p> <p>Social mobility experts are warning that the shift to online learning could severely hold back some students, including those from poorer backgrounds, care leavers, students with caring responsibilities and those with disabilities. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/22/students-should-get-a-years-refund-due-to-covid-19-crisis\">National Union of Students survey</a> suggested that one fifth of students struggle with access, while over half of students who rely on assistive technology felt they lacked the support needed to continue learning.</p> <p>The NUS is now pressuring universities to better accommodate struggling students through<a href=\"https://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/press-releases/national-approach-needed-to-exams-assessment-and-no-detriment-policies-says-nus-/?load=5&amp;top=380\"> a national approach to exams and assessment</a>. \u201cThe most impacted are already the most disadvantaged. This makes no sense when there are solutions available to help them and all students,\u201d says Claire Sosienski-Smith, NUS vice-president for higher education.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be really careful that digital provision doesn\u2019t compound the inequalities we already see in the educational system,\u201d agrees Anne-Marie Canning, chief executive of social mobility charity The Brilliant Club.</p> <p>One solution, Canning says, would be for universities should redirect general bursaries aimed at low income students towards kitting them out with the devices they need for online learning.</p> <p>Some universities are already starting to do this: York has set up a philanthropic fund to support students with online learning, Coventry is exploring making courses accessible by mobile phone, and one other university plans to provide all its disadvantaged students with WiFi dongles.</p> <p>But Emma Hardy, the shadow universities minister, says that these hardship loans can be difficult for students to access. \u201cThey\u2019re limited, bureaucratic and very difficult to get paid out,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Challenges for disadvantaged students extend beyond access to technology. According to <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/promises-and-pitfalls-of-online-education/\">research from 2017</a>, these students consistently perform worse through online learning than they do in face-to-face classrooms. \u201cTaking online courses increases their likelihood of dropping out,\u201d the authors wrote.</p> <p>Chris Skidmore, the former universities minister, warns that these students already struggle with feelings of belonging and are already more likely to drop out of university.</p> <p>\u201cRemote learning must not allow these groups of students to become ever more remote,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford for care-leavers, estranged pupils, and those from vulnerable and deprived backgrounds to miss out on their potential.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Dunn, deputy vice-chancellor at Coventry, says that his university plans to monitor the extent to which students are participating in their courses to give clues as to their wellbeing. <br><br>Martin Weller, professor of educational technology at the Open University, suggests that the mingling that happens naturally on campus can be partly reproduced through incorporating icebreaker and discussion activities into online curriculums. \u201cThere\u2019s evidence that students who form social bonds tend to stick with a course and not drop out,\u201d he says.<br><br>Weller adds that universities need to provide far more structured pastoral care. \u201cThat might be problematic for lots of universities that [rely] on precarious staff to provide teaching. Are they going to give them appropriate time and payment for providing a half-hour catch up every week with every student?\u201d</p> <p>Lucy Gill-Simmen, a lecturer at Royal Holloway University, has offered Zoom catchups to all 70 of her personal tutees to make sure they are coping with the shift to online. \u201cIt has a huge impact on my workload,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But she considers it essential to support her students\u2019 mental health. She\u2019s noticed that some are struggling with the lack of a designated study space and proper equipment. \u201cThat demotivates them, they don\u2019t feel they\u2019re able to get up and get working.\u201d</p> <p>Disabled students are also finding support patchy. Piers Wilkinson, NUS disabled students officer, says that although the Disabled Student Allowance funds laptops, it doesn\u2019t cover everything.</p> <p>\u201cPeople like myself and others that did computer-based modelling or music and media can\u2019t run the fundamental pieces of software that are required by their degree. So they would have to use the specialist IT suites in their department or university library. With those being closed, they\u2019ve lost access to that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2018/oct/05/sign-up-for-guardian-universities-newsletter\">Join us: sign up for the Guardian Universities newsletter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wilkinson adds that although disabled students have been asking universities to roll out lecture capture for years, many have been slow to do this, and staff have not been trained on how to make video content accessible and inclusive.</p> <p>Deaf students in particular find it difficult to lip-read on screens and understand seminars in which multiple people are speaking, and report that many universities do not yet supply subtitles or a British sign language interpreter. Autistic students say they are struggling with the anxiety caused by new systems.</p> <p>One student from Kingston University, who has dyslexia and dyspraxia, says she is struggling to cope. \u201cI have challenges with coordinating and I find using the online portals unfriendly. It takes me a long time to work it out, and this is not factored in when sessions start,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m finding the entire ordeal very stressful and I have emailed lecturers, but I\u2019ve received no reply.\u201d</p> <p>A Kingston University spokesperson said: \u201cStudents are able to access learning materials through the university\u2019s easily accessible virtual learning environment, Canvas, which is functioning as normal, and we are making additional adjustment for students with statement of special needs, including making available assistive technology and human support during the assessment period.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",

Higher death rates due to lungs and hearts weakened by dirty air is the best understood. Pollutants also inflame lungs, potentially making catching the virus more likely and raising concern about rising pollution levels after lockdowns are lifted. Finally, particles of pollution might even help carry the virus further afield.</p> \n<p>The studies done so far around the world are mostly \u201cpre-prints\u201d \u2013 they have not yet been endorsed by independent scientists through the peer-review process.

But if you do a study which is filled with potential biases, you\u2019re not doing the public any good by publishing. [Fossil fuel lobbyists] are just going to say, \u2018Well, why should we believe anything you do?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Francesca Dominici, who led the study at Harvard, disagreed: \u201cI think the responsible reaction from a scientist is to respond to a pandemic by doing the best that you can with the data that you have.

All our papers are going to be reviewed and, of course, to make new legislation, the work has to be better.

This validated our conclusions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Frank Kelly, at Imperial College London, UK, said his group was not publishing preliminary analyses. \u201cThe Harvard study has been the best but there are still major issues with it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Air pollution research has often shown it leads to small increases in people\u2019s individual risk of many diseases but, because entire populations are exposed to dirty air, the total increase in health damage is large.</p> \n<p>It is not yet clear how big the impact of air pollution is on the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThat is a really difficult question to answer at the moment,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/apr/28/covid-19-what-role-might-air-pollution-play-podcast\">said Prof Anna Hansell</a>, at the University of Leicester. \u201cI suspect it is in line with our general observations of air pollution. But if you look across a whole population, a small increase in risk is something you might want to do something about and air pollution is a modifiable risk factor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kelly is concerned about the rise in air pollution after the end of lockdowns, as is <a href=\"https://eeb.org/air-pollution-returns-to-china/\">already being seen in China</a>. \u201cCurrently, air quality in cities is pretty good because of the shutdown,\u201d he said. Rising air pollution will increase inflammation in the lungs of some people. \u201cIf they are then exposed to a separate wave of the virus, the question is whether they will be more susceptible than the general population.\u201d</p> \n<p>All the researchers hope that the dangers of air pollution exposed by the coronavirus pandemic and the cleaner skies seen during the lockdowns will lead to lasting change.

  "<p>Before my world was reduced to a two-mile radius from my house, I never realised how interesting other people\u2019s front gardens could be. When your life is confined to the same four walls, with each journey to the kitchen an odyssey, the world outside takes on a whole new allure. I now find myself entranced by all the different varieties of privet hedge, intrigued by people\u2019s choice of gravel size and paving pattern, captivated by the clusters of cacti perched on windowsills. Front doors have become a new form of entertainment, as have the subtleties of window-mouldings and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architrave\">architraves</a>. Who knew there could be so many varieties of mortar on a single street?</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing like six weeks of house arrest to give you an elevated awareness of your surroundings. And it\u2019s a phenomenon that hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed at the nation\u2019s grand repository of objects, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/v-and-a\">the Victoria and Albert</a>. \u201cThe pandemic has this weird way of bringing to the fore objects you would never have thought about,\u201d says Brendan Cormier, senior design curator at the London museum. \u201cEverything becomes heightened.\u201d</p> <p>With future exhibitions on hold and collecting in limbo, Cormier has turned his team\u2019s attention to thinking about how the coronavirus has reframed the everyday, casting familiar objects in a very different light. Which is why the V&amp;A is just about to launch <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/\">Pandemic Objects</a>, an online series examining how a range of unremarkable items have become charged with new meaning and purpose.</p> <p>\u201cThere are so many designed objects and inventions coming out of the pandemic,\u201d says Cormier, citing all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/25/10-coronavirus-covid-busting-designs\">hands-free door openers and 3D-printed face visors</a>. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take time to work out which ones are actually useful.\u201d He thinks there\u2019s a danger that some much-touted innovations might end up being \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/vapourware-the-tech-that-never-was/\">vapourware</a>\u201d \u2013 flashy concepts that catch the attention of design blogs, but never come to fruition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b291e2c0590fc73497ab09182068afe7bd0277c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b291e2c0590fc73497ab09182068afe7bd0277c3/0_0_5307_3538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Solidarity \u2026 children\u2019s signs thank key workers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solidarity \u2026 children\u2019s signs thank key workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The V&amp;A design department has made headlines with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jul/02/victoria-and-albert-rapid-response-gallery-unveiled\">Rapid Response Collecting</a>, an initiative that has snapped up such zeitgeisty objects as the Liberator 3D-printed handgun, the plans for which were released online in 2013, and one of pink knitted <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-pussyhat\">pussyhats</a> worn by half a million attendees at the Women\u2019s March in Washington DC in 2017. But with everything now changing so rapidly, curators have decided there\u2019s some value in slowing down. Instead of rushing out to collect Covid ephemera, Cormier thinks the museum\u2019s time would be better spent looking afresh at what\u2019s right under our noses. \u201cIs the pandemic revealing anything new,\u201d he asks, \u201cabout things we take for granted?\u201d<br><br>One of the first things to catch his attention was the wealth of hastily drawn homemade signs cropping up in shop windows around the world, explaining new delivery services and warning people to keep 2m apart. It seemed to say something about our relationship with technology and public messaging: the 1990s craze for inkjet printers promised everyone the professional finish of a publishing house in the comfort of their own home. Yet, three decades on, most of us seem to have thrown out our printers, sick of clogged-up, eye-wateringly expensive cartridges, and have embraced the paperless society. \u201cIn the moment of need, when the situation is changing so rapidly,\u201d says Cormier, \u201cwe\u2019ve gone back to pen and paper.\u201d</p> <p>Putting signs in windows quickly spread to the home, too, as a means of both expressing community solidarity and keeping the kids occupied. Headteachers encouraged pupils <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51988671\">to paint hopeful rainbows</a> and stick them in windows, fuelling neighbourly rivalry with evermore elaborate formations, ranging from chalk to neon paint and Lego bricks. It wasn\u2019t long before this homespun movement was co-opted by the art world, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/20/damien-hirst-rainbow-in-support-of-nhs-coronavirus-butterfly-rainbow\">Damien Hirst offering his own butterfly-wing rainbow</a> to download.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74c220690e801d6d0c860443b32345b98ac87d7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74c220690e801d6d0c860443b32345b98ac87d7c/0_274_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don\u2019t we all have printers? \u2026 shop sign in Windermere.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don\u2019t we all have printers? \u2026 shop sign in Windermere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Catherine Flood, co-curator of the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/inside-the-food-bigger-than-the-plate-exhibition\">V&amp;A\u2019s Food exhibition</a> last year, will examine how the pandemic has changed perceptions of certain kitchen-cupboard staples. Flour and yeast, more used to being spilled on surfaces and swept into bins, have become sought-after luxuries, as we all try <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/14/grains-flour-shortage-tells-us-about-who-we-are\">to channel our inner bakers</a>. Instagram has become the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sourdough/?hl=en\">Sourdough Olympics</a>, awash with competitive posts, while flour mills are working around the clock to fulfil demand as wheat prices surge and well-stocked shelves become a rarity.</p> <p>Traffic to the BBC\u2019s basic bread recipe has risen faster than a cob in a 250-degree oven, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52212760\">with numbers up by 875%</a>. But need does not seem to be what\u2019s driving demand, as bread is still readily available in shops. It\u2019s the therapeutic quality of baking that\u2019s the attraction, Cormier thinks, the tactile and meditative quality of the process, along with a desire to feel self-sufficient.</p> <p>\u201cFlour is now a privilege,\u201d he says, and he doesn\u2019t just mean being able to find it in shops. \u201cTo bake bread, you need to be able to work at home, and have time to invest. It\u2019s probably not frontline key workers who have the pleasure of rediscovering the miracles of baking.\u201d</p> <p>As research for a potential future exhibition on accessibility in design, curator Natalie Kane has been looking at the door handle \u2013 a seemingly innocuous part of the built environment that has become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/13/smart-lifts-lonely-workers-no-towers-architecture-after-covid-19-coronavirus\">a</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/13/smart-lifts-lonely-workers-no-towers-architecture-after-covid-19-coronavirus\"> villain </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/13/smart-lifts-lonely-workers-no-towers-architecture-after-covid-19-coronavirus\">in the age of coronavirus</a>. Since early March, when it was first announced that the virus could survive on surfaces for up to three days, we\u2019ve been elbowing and toeing our way through doors, suddenly aware of just how often we use our hands to navigate through the world. Could the pandemic finally force society to accept what disability groups have been campaigning about for decades \u2013 that such things are obstacles rather than aids?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7566585a1cc1ef6771c32395147a205f0cbcac8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7566585a1cc1ef6771c32395147a205f0cbcac8/0_311_5504_7105/775.jpg\" alt=\"Do not touch \u2026 door handle protection in Brighton.\" width=\"775\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Do not touch \u2026 door handle protection in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Santa Cruz/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, as travel has been curtailed, the online realm has offered one of the few options for escapism. Some have turned to Google Street View to sate their wanderlust, whiling away hours touring the side streets of far-flung locations or panning through 3D cityscapes. The Canadian artist Jon Rafman has revived his project <a href=\"https://anthology.rhizome.org/9-eyes\">The Nine Eyes of Google Street View</a>. Begun in 2008 when the medium was still novel, the projects trawls the globe\u2019s virtual streets for alarming scenes \u2013 from a moose careering down a highway to a gun-toting gang caught mid-heist, to naked bodies sprawled across the pavement.</p> <p>Now, these unruly snapshots seem like glimpses of another time, glitches in the lockdown matrix. V&amp;A curator Ella Kilgallon will examine the Street View phenomenon, putting it in the context of such earlier documentary initiatives as the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/sir-benjamin-stone-and-the-NPRA/\">National Photographic Record Association</a>), established in 1897 in an attempt to create a comprehensive record of British life. Taking advantage of the expansion of photography as an increasingly popular hobby at the turn of the century, the association planned to form a countrywide \u201cmemory bank\u201d to foster \u201cnational pride\u201d. It culminated in 5,883 photographs by 1910. In the last 12 years, Google has captured 10 million miles of the Earth\u2019s surface in 360-degree images, <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/google-maps-has-now-photographed-10-million-miles-in-street-view/\">equivalent to circling the planet more than 400 times</a>.<br><br>Further entries in the Pandemic Objects series will shine a spotlight on toilet paper, streaming services, cardboard packaging, balconies and more, one of the more triumphant stories being the revival of the sewing machine. \u201cDespite all the hype around distributed manufacturing and downloadable customised designs, not many of us have a 3D-printer at home,\u201d says Cormier. \u201cYet the great 19th-century invention of the sewing machine is still a ubiquitous household item.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d06e72ffd7e2a624342f2ec0c28876e0155873e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d06e72ffd7e2a624342f2ec0c28876e0155873e/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"homemade protective masks take shape.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Make do \u2026 homemade protective masks take shape.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sales of sewing machines have rocketed in the pandemic, recalling the <a href=\"https://www.victoryliving.co.uk/make-do-and-mend\">Make Do and Mend</a> movement of the second world war, as people join <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52328229\">the effort to mass-produce face masks</a>. One of the chief obstacles to such community craftivism, says Cormier, is managing production and distribution. After the recent bush fires in Australia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/07/australia-wildfires-animals-shelters-knitting\">an international callout for people to knit koala mittens and wombat pouches</a> triggered a tidal wave of marsupial mitts, far more than could possibly be used. As thousands of companies and hobbyists have <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2020/04/13/face-shields-coronavirus-apple-foster/\">sign up to produce face-shields</a> in the great national struggle for PPE, it remains to be seen how effectively they can be distributed to where they are needed most.<br><br>Whether it\u2019s a newfound respect for loo roll, a growing suspicion of excessive cardboard packaging, or a phobia of door handles, when the pandemic finally subsides, we may never look at everyday objects in the same way again.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Pandemic Objects is at </em><em><a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/\">vam.ac.uk/blog/</a></em></p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Global coronavirus cases top 3.5 million</strong></h2> <p>The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide has passed 3.5 million, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million. North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. There are currently 3,506,924 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,473 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2><strong>Trump \u2018very confident\u2019 there will be a vaccine by the end of this year</strong></h2> <p>US president Donald Trump is \u201cvery confident\u201d there will be vaccine by the end of 2020. In a \u201cvirtual town hall\u201d with Fox news, Trump said: \u201cWe are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year.\u201d Trump\u2019s declaration came despite his own pandemic task force predicting it could be another 18 months. The US president also said that up to 100,000 Americans could die in the pandemic.</p> <h2>Mike Pompeo says coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory</h2> <p>The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, claimed there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">but did not provide any of the alleged evidence</a>. US intelligence had issued a formal statement saying the scientific consensus is the virus was not manmade or genetically modified. When reminded of this, Pompeo replied: \u2018That\u2019s right. I agree with that.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>France won\u2019t quarantine EU, Schengen area citizens</h2> <p>France said Sunday that it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/france-proposes-coronavirus-quarantine-for-visitors-from-abroad\">not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU</a>, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown. On Saturday, the government had said it would extend the state of emergency to contain the crisis until at least 24 July, and anyone entering France would have to remain in isolation for two weeks.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand records zero new cases</strong></h2> <p>New Zealand has recorded a day of no new cases of Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/new-zealand-records-first-day-with-no-new-covid-19-cases-since-before-lockdown\">for the first time since before the lockdown</a>.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s an \u201cencouraging\u201d result, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health. There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people were still in hospital.</p> <h2><strong>Japan expected to extend state of emergency until end of May</strong></h2> <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is set to extend the country\u2019s state of emergency on Monday, until the end of May, public broadcaster NHK said. The government is also expected to determine new prevention measures for the coronavirus outbreak that has infected around 15,000 people and killed more than 500 in the country, Reuters reports.</p> <h2><strong>Bolsonaro fuels protests in defiance of health advice</strong></h2> <p>Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry\u2019s appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Brazil passed 100,000 confirmed cases. There have been 4,588 new cases of the coronavirus in Brazil and 275 deaths over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday, bringing total confirmed cases in the country to over 100,000.</p> <h2>UK and France to trial tracing apps</h2> <p>France\u2019s tracing app expected to enter testing week on Monday. France\u2019s state-supported \u201cStopCOVID\u201d contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister has said. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove announced as the government looked to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection.</p>",

  "<p>School has resumed after the holidays, and it will not be as any student has experienced before. But this isn\u2019t the first time we have sacrificed our education to flatten a curve for the greater good. We\u2019ve been doing it since 2018 when we decided to forego school classes on Fridays to bring attention to the climate crisis and the exponential curve of fossil fuel emissions that, according to the World Health Organisation, kills seven million people a year.</p> <p>As young people locked in our houses with endless video calls for uni and work, we are worried. Are we the first generation to watch the world go through two exponential crises? One of medical concern, threatening the lives of millions and locking down countries. And the other a climate crisis that is already affecting billions and could end life on this planet as we know it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2020/may/02/australia-listened-to-the-experts-on-coronavirus-its-time-we-heard-them-on-climate-change\">Australia listened to the experts on coronavirus.

The loss of life is awful. But it has given hope the world can take the collective action needed to stop it. We have acted for Covid-19 by putting aside our political squabbles; we can do this for the climate crisis too. <br><br>Covid-19 exacerbates inequalities that already exist in our society. It is already vulnerable people who suffer most: low-income families, those in regional and rural areas, First Nations people, young people, women and elderly people. This is also true of climate change. And just like with Covid-19, we all need to play our part in adjusting the new normals of our world, because it will never be the same again.</p> <p>As countries increase their lockdowns and individuals are travelling far less, global emissions are reducing and air quality is increasing.

If climate change were treated like the crisis that it is, governments would respond swiftly, instead of spending decades debating the cost of action.
