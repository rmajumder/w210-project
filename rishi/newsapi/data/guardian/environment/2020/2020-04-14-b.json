Iata\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The industry\u2019s outlook grows darker by the day.

Allowing them an exemption would weaken any debt-relief initiative. Providing aid through the World Bank and other donors while allowing commercial debt payments to absorb a large share of the transfer would be the financial equivalent of pouring water into a bucket with large holes. To put the figures in context, commercial debt repayments would be equivalent to over half of the emergency Covid-19 financing being prepared by the World Bank for delivery through IDA.</p> \n   <p>... Official creditors should make it clear that they expect commercial creditors to apply comparable treatment. There are precedents which, if not directly applicable, could serve as a guide. These include the \u2018Vienna Initiative\u2019 through which European governments coordinated the response to the 2009 financial crisis. If necessary, governments should encourage participation by making access to special Covid-19 financing programmes conditional on commercial creditors participating in the debt standstill. Faced with a global public health emergency that demands a global financial response, governments must deploy their regulatory powers and financial resources in the interest. The G20 should work with the IMF and World Bank to convene a commercial creditors summit to agree terms for creditor participation in debt repayment suspension.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/commercial-creditors-must-sign-up-to-global-debt-deal-or-forgo-covid-19-help\">Commercial creditors 'must sign up to global debt deal' - or forgo Covid-19 help</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:57:16.441Z\">at 5.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95e3c18f082a2cd32a6aa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:38:41.425Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus lockdown in <strong>Uganda</strong> has been extended for another three weeks, with the president, Yoweri Museveni, calling on people to be disciplined to avoid spreading infection. </p> \n  <p>In a lengthy address to the nation on Tuesday, Museveni reaffirmed Uganda\u2019s 35 restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, adding that judging by the comparatively low number of infections in the country - 54 confirmed cases as of Monday - they seemed to have worked.

The strictest measures implemented so far have been gatherings of more than 50 people and a ban on visits to nursing homes.</p> \n  <p>But its soft approach has drawn criticism. On Tuesday Sweden\u2019s public health agency said it had recorded a total of 11,445 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,033 deaths. Neighbouring Finland, which has about half the population of Sweden, had as of Tuesday reported 64 deaths, and has closed down restaurants and schools.</p> \n  <p>In an open letter, a group of 22 doctors, virologists and researchers from Sweden\u2019s top hospitals, universities and research institutes pointed write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One would like to imagine that Sweden has also had a forward-looking strategy, especially as our country has always had a different way of dealing with the spread of infection than the rest of the world. One would like to imagine that our authorities have prepared well since the epidemic broke out in China, and especially since it was clear that the problem was likely to be global.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 If there was a well-thought-out, well-functioning strategy for Swedish infection prevention work with Covid-19, Sweden would hardly have the same death toll as Italy today, and 10 times higher than Finland\u2019s. If there had been a well-developed, well-functioning strategy, half of Stockholm\u2019s elderly residents would not have been affected by the epidemic - and in some cases over 20% of the healthcare staff would be antibody positive.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 The approach must be changed radically and quickly. As the disease-free virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants in the same way you do in Finland. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Prior to mass testing of infectiousness on all caring staff and testing for antibodies to sars-covid-2 so that established immune personnel can return to work.

He appealed to Germans to continue following the hygiene regulations as well as keeping their distance, saying these remained the two most crucial ways to dampen the virus\u2019 spread.</p> \n  <p>He added that in Germany the average age of those infected was 49, and a cough, temperature, blocked nose and loss of taste and smell remained the most commonly reported symptoms. In 2% of cases people developed pneumonia he said, while 16% of cases ended up in hospital.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina released a long-awaited study in which it recommended a staggered return to normal life starting with schools reopening.

system</h2> \n  <p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> \n  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> \n  <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. </p> \n  <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95475c8f08db3109f21f15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T05:18:50.139Z\">6.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global Covid-19 cases near 2 million as Putin warns Russia faces \u2018extraordinary\u2019 crisis</h2> \n  <p>The number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow.

Last Man on Earth is possibly the most relevant sitcom for these times. </strong>Will Forte plays Phil Miller, a man who believes he is the sole survivor of a pandemic that has wiped out the world\u2019s population. Running for four seasons, before being cancelled on a cliffhanger, Van Badham writes that this is no reason to not try out a comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/15/the-last-man-on-earth-a-tender-and-powerfully-life-affirming-post-apocalyptic-sitcom\">whose quirky tone earned it a cult following</a>. \u201cThe conceptual triumph of Forte\u2019s show is that the tragedy of the event is enhanced, rather than trivialised, by the comedy taking place in its aftermath. Its survivor characters may be clowns who trip over the imperfect humanity of themselves and one another, but The Last Man on Earth treats the dead with solemnity, and against this, the haplessness of living people who consistently struggle to manage the heroic is tender and powerfully life-affirming.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s physical distancing measures have had great success at reducing the rate of Covid-19 infection. </strong>The estimated effective reproduction number is below 1, meaning each person infected is believed to pass the coronavirus on to less than one other person on average \u2013 an important milestone to decrease the number of active cases.

Libya\u2019s Directorate for Combating Illegal Migration does not seem able or prepared to take more detainees.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/italy-to-renew-anti-migration-deal-with-libya\">Since a deal was signed with the Italian government</a> in 2017, the Libyan coastguard has stopped migrant boats heading to Europe at sea and sent their passengers back to Libya, where aid agencies say they face torture and abuse.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/04/migrants-never-disappeared-the-lone-rescue-ship-braving-a-pandemic-coronavirus\">Despite the fear of Covid-19, hundreds of migrants continue to risk their lives at sea in order to reach Europe</a>.</p> <p>EU member states have been accused of abandoning people at sea after failing to respond to information provided by NGOs that four boats, carrying 258 migrants between them, were in distress.</p> <p>In an unprecedented move on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/italy-declares-own-ports-unsafe-to-stop-migrants-disembarking\">the Italian government also declared its seaports \u201cunsafe\u201d</a> because of the coronavirus pandemic and said it would not authorise the landing of migrant rescue boats until the end of the emergency.</p> <p>A few days earlier, Malta\u2019s government took a similar measure and also declared its seaports closed to migrants, citing the threat of the coronavirus. According to charities, Maltese authorities have also increasingly been delaying responses to migrant boats in distress.</p> <p>Alarm Phone, a hotline service for migrants in distress at sea, has shared two audio recordings with the Guardian of a series of calls from a group of asylum seekers claiming an official from a Maltese navy boat on Thursday sabotaged their vessel, carrying about 70 people, by cutting the engine cable.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an emergency here,\u201d a man can be heard saying in one of the audio recordings. \u201cThe Maltese military came and cut the motor cable. There is water in the boat. The Maltese military said: \u2018We will leave you to die in the water. Nobody will come to Malta.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease help us. We will die,\u201d says another man. \u201cThe Malta military ship number is P52.\u201d</p> <p>The migrants, who were allegedly boarded by the Maltese navy roughly 20 miles south-west of Malta, were eventually rescued by the Maltese authorities.</p> <p>The Guardian has asked the Maltese navy for comment but the officials have did not respond.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the coronavirus emergency, the central Mediterranean route has become increasingly impenetrable for people fleeing war-afflicted Libya.</p> <p>The risk, according to charitable organisations, is that the restrictive measures in Italy and Malta will set the migrant situation back years, to when boats from Libya would set off on their own, risking people\u2019s lives in the attempt to reach Italian shores.</p> <p>\u201cEuropean governments\u2019 actions to close their ports to people rescued at sea put lives at risk and cannot be justified on public health grounds,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/judith-sunderland\">Judith Sunderland</a>, associate Europe and central Asia director at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>\u201cRecent and unfolding events in the Mediterranean Sea raise serious concerns that <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/europe/central-asia/european-union\">European Union</a> countries will use the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to evade their responsibilities under international law to respond to boats in distress at sea.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Italian authorities said a 15-year-old who had landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa on Tuesday had tested positive for Covid-19 and been placed under quarantine.</p> <p>The rescue boat Alan Kurdi, operated by the German NGO Sea Eye and named after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/alan-kurdi-khaled-hosseini-mediterranean-refugees-sea-prayer\">three-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in 2015</a>, is currently the only NGO rescue boat operating in the central Mediterranean.</p> <p>The coronavirus outbreak has forced many charities to concentrate their aid efforts elsewhere, while other rescue groups, such as Sea Watch and SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, have not returned to international waters after being quarantined for 14 days after their last missions at the end of February.</p> <p>In a sign of how dangerous Libya is for those trying to reach Europe, dozens of people held at Tripoli\u2019s main port since Thursday fled the facility as it was being shelled early on Friday morning.</p>",
  "<p>On Monday night Interview magazine dropped their new cover on Instagram \u2013 a hyper-urban shot of singer<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7BEWRBkVD/\"> Selena Gomez</a> with her tongue sticking out, dressed in black boots, leggings and a Balenciaga X-Rated top. On her head the singer sported a braided hairstyle with baby-hair edges. The hispanic Gomez also appeared to have a darker complexion than she would normally have. \u201cShe is done letting people control her narrative,\u201d the magazine wrote in the caption below. And yet the cover image styling appeared to show the singer appropriating from another culture completely. \u201cThis is blackfishing y\u2019all wake up,\u201d read one comment under the cover image, while the website <a href=\"https://twitter.com/popcreave/status/1249698482673397760\">Pop Crave</a> tweeted the question: \u201cWhy is Selena Gomez trying to be black \u2026\u201d \u2013 featuring pictures from the Interview shoot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7BEWRBkVD/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Many Twitter users found it troubling that she was turning her skin into a darker shade than it was naturally, comparing her to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/rachel-dolezal-i-wasnt-identifying-as-black-to-upset-people-i-was-being-me\">Rachel Dolezal</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI do question the motivation behind some people\u2019s excessive use of tanner,\u201d says the journalist Wanna Thompson. \u201cDo I believe that every person who tans wants to be black? Not particularly, but I do wonder about the need to make yourself appear several shades darker. Who are you trying to emulate?\u201d Thompson came up with the term \u201cblackfishing\u201d when she saw a discussion about white women cosplaying as black women on Twitter. \u201cAnd I said to myself, \u2018I need to bring awareness to this growing issue\u2019. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been prevalent,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cBe it fashion, beauty or music.

Is it even roughly the correct number, though?</p> <p>Jamie Dimon, unrivalled titan of Wall Street, didn\u2019t quite shrug his shoulders nor did he indulge his normal habit of assessing the state of the world for lesser mortals. The provision was taken because of \u201cthe likelihood of a fairly severe recession\u201d, which is stating the obvious, but then his finance director said the reserves \u201ccould be meaningfully higher in aggregate over the next several quarters relative to what we took in the first quarter\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/jp-morgan-sets-aside-83bn-to-cover-covid-19-losses\">JP Morgan sets aside $8.3bn to cover Covid-19 losses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other words, the financial damage could be a lot worse than JP Morgan\u2019s first assessment. Therein lies the external truth about banks\u2019 credit provisioning: the numbers are guesswork \u2013 and now more so than ever. Dimon is as much in the dark as everyone else.</p> <p>JP Morgan can, of course, easily absorb its provisions. Even after the $8.3bn (\u00a36.5bn) charge, the bank recorded profits of $2.9bn. Only a few bricks have been dislodged from the \u201cfortress\u201d balance sheet the bank never fails to mention.</p> <p>Yet stock market investors, you would think, might pause for reflection at this point. Share prices have rallied hard for two weeks on the assumption that lockdowns will soon be over and governments\u2019 stimulus packages will ensure a rapid return to normal economic life. The script looks highly speculative and JP Morgan, a supposed bellwether of the US economy, isn\u2019t giving any reliable signals in support. Rather, even $8bn could be just the first course.</p> <h2>New Centrica boss must offer something new</h2> <p>The chief executive\u2019s gig at Centrica used to be a big job in UK plc. The owner of British Gas would usually be able to pluck a high-flyer from the ranks of a major oil and gas company; Iain Conn, chief until last month, had been head of BP\u2019s downstream operations.</p> <p>These days succession planning seems to be more of an on-the-hoof affair. Conn was originally supposed to stay until the summer while a new recruit was found, but finance director Chris O\u2019Shea was installed as a stand-in a few weeks ago. Now O\u2019Shea has got the job permanently because Scott Wheway, himself a newbie as chairman, says he is \u201ccomprehensively the best candidate\u201d.</p> <p>Maybe he is. But the internal promotion of the finance director, even one who has been in post for only 18 months, probably isn\u2019t going to satisfy those investors who think Centrica is in urgent need of a shakeup, which usually means an outsider.</p> <p>You can see any appearance of continuity would not appeal. On Conn\u2019s five-year watch, the share price fell from 280p to today\u2019s 33p. With a stock market value of just \u00a32bn, Centrica is heading out of the FTSE 100 index unless<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/british-gas-braces-for-steep-drop-in-revenues-because-of-coronavirus\"> the battered share price doubles by June</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>O\u2019Shea \u2013 who knows? \u2013 may turn out to be a brilliant appointment.

  "<p>Richmond\u2019s return to the Championship is a parable for the most challenging period rugby has faced. A club that do not have contracts with their players and whose priority is the organisation and everyone involved in it rather than the first team stood alone the last time they were first promoted to English rugby\u2019s second tier three years ago. But their model is set to be copied by others as the financial impact of the coronavirus lockdown deepens.</p> <p>\u201cThe finances of the Championship simply don\u2019t work,\u201d says Steve Hill, Richmond\u2019s director of rugby for the past 10 years and first-team head coach. \u201cWith the cuts to it that will be made by the Rugby Football Union, more clubs will have to look at our model. Outside Ealing Trailfinders, who have a wealthy backer, virtually all are losing money and it cannot continue. You do not want clubs going out of existence but we are in danger of that happening as things stand.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/rfu-to-spread-drastic-championship-funding-cuts-over-two-seasons-rugby-union\">RFU to spread drastic Championship funding cuts over two seasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Richmond\u2019s two-season fling in the Premiership ended in 1999 when their backer pulled out and they dropped to the bottom of the league pyramid. They are trading places with Yorkshire Carnegie, who survived last season at the expense of the south-west London club after parachuting in players to help them to avoid relegation. Yorkshire controversially retained their status after agreeing a company voluntary agreement with creditors, having piled up debts of more than \u00a3500,000. This season Yorkshire have lost all 14 league games, are set to leave Headingley and are reverting back to being called Leeds.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose it made our promotion doubly sweet,\u201d Hill says. \u201cThe RFU told us Carnegie were going to be very competitive this season. We knew that would not be the case, but 12 months on we really enjoyed our season in National Division One, a cracking, incredibly competitive competition. We were not the favourites to win it, with some clubs paying a lot more than our match fees . The highest payers hit trouble and lost players, reinforcing my belief that rugby beneath the Premiership needs to be reset.</p> <p>\u201cMore teams will have to become part-time. There is no other way if rugby is to become financially sustainable. All sports will have to consider how and where money is spent. If rugby goes back to the days when clubs invested in facilities, coaching and creating a really good social atmosphere, that will attract players because they will not be able to do so by offering money. Some of the amounts being offered at level four and below are ridiculous: a lot of that will now have to disappear, which will be a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>Like all clubs, Richmond have had to make adjustments as income all but stops but they have not had to furlough players who hold full-time jobs in spheres ranging from teaching and recruitment to carpentry and sourcing film locations for production companies. \u201cWe pay a match fee and it is the same whether you have played 150 matches for the club or are making your debut,\u201d Hill says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22e75850b312c5d637bd6a0db5f4104d57da73e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22e75850b312c5d637bd6a0db5f4104d57da73e1/0_0_3312_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richmond Rugby\u2019s Director of Rugby Steve Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The finances of the Championship simply don\u2019t work\u2019 says Richmond\u2019s director of rugby, Steve Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Bradford/CameraSport via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are no contract negotiations and no one talks about money when they are having a meal after a game. They have proper conversations and I do not envy rugby directors who have to pick certain players because they are on big money. I can say to any new player that if they are good enough, they will be in the team; it is a powerful recruitment tool and I would struggle to explain to someone why another player was worth twice as much as him. \u201d</p> <p>Next season, Richmond will play Saracens for the first time in 21 years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/26/saracens-salary-cap-scandal\" title=\"\">the overspenders</a> against the unsalaried. \u201cIt will be amazing,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt is the first question everyone asks me. There will be no pressure on us. When Bristol were last in the Championship, we were level 24-24 with them at half\u2011time at home. Pat Lam [the Bears\u2019 director of rugby] was going ballistic in the stand. They pulled away in the second half but we showed we can compete and in our three seasons in the Championship, Bristol and London Irish were the only clubs we did not beat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/16/championship-funding-cut-is-an-awful-thing-and-a-sad-day-for-rugby\">Championship funding cut is 'an awful thing and a sad day for rugby'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI do not know how many of Saracens\u2019 superstars will face us but anyone who plays for them is outstanding: their academy is second to none. It will be a fantastic occasion and we are looking forward to the away games at Cornish Pirates and Jersey, great weekends. We will stay over in Jersey and have a night out.

Of course being able to announce almost limitless government spending does help a lot, but he is less evasive than most of his colleagues and generally does a better job than the rest of them at sounding positive yet not deluded.</p> \n  <p>He managed it again today, even though some of his assumptions are verging on the heroic. The OBR does broadly back his claim that the economy will be able to recover quickly. But his suggestion that Boris Johnson\u2019s open-chequebook \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda will be able to survive intact after the national debt has risen much higher seems optimistic, to put it politely. And perhaps his boldest claim is that this is no inherent tension between safeguarding the economy and protecting lives. That argument might look robust now, but it is likely to appear more tenuous in the months to come.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak insisted that the UK economy would be able to recover \u201cquickly and strongly\u201d after the coronavirus crisis was over. </strong>He made the claim in response to a report from the Office for Budget Responsibility suggesting a three-month lockdown, followed by three more months of partial lockdown measures, could shrink GDP by 35% and put unemployment up by more than 2m. Sunak insisted that this was not a firm forecast, but he accepted that the economic impact of the crisis would be significant. However, he claimed recovery could come very quickly. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is going to be hard, our economy\u2019s going to take a significant hit and as I\u2019ve said before that\u2019s not an abstract thing, people are going to feel that in their jobs and in their household incomes ...</p> \n   <p>Yes it will be difficult in the short term. I\u2019m happy to be honest about that with people. I think the measures we\u2019ve put in place will help and then as we get through this it will mean that we can recover quickly and strongly and get our lives and economy back to normal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Improbable as this claim may seem, it is in line with <a href=\"https://obr.uk/coronavirus-reference-scenario/\">the OBR analysis, </a>which envisages that says that \u201creal GDP falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak rejected suggestions that the coronavirus crisis, and the enormous increase in government borrowing and debt that it will generate, would prevent the government from pursuing its \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda (which prioritises infrastructure spending, particularly in the north)</strong>. When this suggestion was put to him, he replied: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Once we get through this obviously we will have to take stock of public finances and the economy and make the right decisions at that point and I\u2019ve talked before about doing whatever we need to to right the ship at that point.</p> \n   <p>But what I would say is we remain very committed to the agenda that we set out before which was about levelling up and spreading opportunity around this country, and indeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal here.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected claims that there was an inherent contradiction between protecting the economy and saving lives.</strong> In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-delivers-daily-coronavirus-update-14-april-2020\">his opening remarks</a> he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The third point I want to make is this: right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health \u2013 common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating.</p> \n   <p>At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources \u2026</p> \n   <p>\u2026 not just of the state, but of businesses, and of all of you at home as well, in a collective national effort to beat this virus.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He refused to back a call for the government to scrap the pensions \u201ctriple lock\u201d as a result of the crisis, to free up money to help young workers who are particularly likely to be disadvantaged</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/scrap-triple-lock-uk-pensions-coronavirus-crisis\">The Social Market Foundation, a centrist thinktank, has proposed this idea.</a> Asked if he agreed, Sunak said he would not write his budget now. But he said he wanted to provide opportunity for people, whatever age they were.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the government was working with the ONS to speed up the publication of information about the deaths of people with coronavirus in care homes.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the coronavirus job retention scheme is due to open on 20 April.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said he would c</strong><strong>onsider making some of the coronavirus business loans 100% guaranteed by the government, not just 80% guaranteed. </strong>George Osborne, a former Tory chancellor, has proposed this idea.

He has already won a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/08/wheelchair-users-uk-enhanced-rights-bus-travel-supreme-court\">landmark case at the supreme court on the rights of wheelchair users on buses</a>. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is an extremely worrying time for me, as it is for all disabled people. I understand that difficult decisions will have to be made, but at the moment we just don\u2019t know how doctors are going to prioritise life-saving treatment for coronavirus. I\u2019m concerned that without proper guidance, doctors may decide not to treat me, simply because of my impairments. </p> \n   <p>I feel strongly that I should be given the same chance as anyone else - all I\u2019m asking for is some reassurance that my life will be valued as much as the next person.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Anne-Marie Irwin, a partner at Rook Irwin Sweeney who acts for the campaigners, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My clients are not asking for special treatment, and they know how hard NHS staff up and down the country are working to save lives. Having said that, they are entitled to know how they will be treated if they contract coronavirus and need life-saving treatment. </p> \n   <p>Our clients consider it irrational that national guidance has not been put in place, and that the government is failing in its duty to protect their human rights.

Now they take place by conference call, just once a day, and they regularly last for more than an hour (like today\u2019s).

Sunak is chairing the government\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference at 5pm this afternoon.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman implied the OBR report vindicated government policy. </strong>He said the report confirmed that, if the government had not intervened, the economic impact on people would be \u201cmuch worse\u201d. And he said the OBR did say that the impact of the lockdown would be \u201ccontained in time\u201d and that there would be a rapid bounce back.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Treasury spokesman said figures for how many workers were being furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme would be available when the online portal was up and running at the end of April.</strong> The OBR estimates that around of 30% of employees will take advantage of this. <a href=\"https://obr.uk/coronavirus-reference-scenario/\">The OBR report</a> says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have tried to estimate a cost that is consistent with the assumptions underpinning the economic scenario. Doing so implies that around 30 per cent of employees will be covered at a cost of \u00a342bn (equivalent to almost 15 per cent of total employee compensation in the baseline). We estimate that around a fifth of that returns to the Exchequer in income tax and NICs \u2013 an effect that is captured implicitly via the fiscal ready-reckoning rather than explicitly here. The first payments are expected this month.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The Treasury spokesman rejected claims that take-up was higher than the government expected. He said that the Treasury had never predicted what the take-up would be, and that a high take-up showed that the scheme was doing what it was meant to be doing.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that the OBR\u2019s decision to model the impact of a three-month lockdown, followed by three months of partial lockdown (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e959a8d8f082c29014b0914#block-5e959a8d8f082c29014b0914\"> 12.16pm)</a>, should not be seen as an indication of what the government was planning.</strong> It was just a modelling assumption by the OBR, he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman rejected suggestions that the government was playing down the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes</strong>.

When it was put to him that the figures being given by care home providers suggested the official government figures for the number of care homes affected by coronavirus (13.5%) understated the scale of the problem, the spokesman said the government figure was the best available.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said the most recently daily figure for the overall number of tests carried out (in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday) was 14,506.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman was unable to say whether the government would investigate every death of a social care worker with coronavirus.</strong> The government has said that the death of every NHS worker with coronavirus will be investigated.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) was meeting now to consider its evidence for government about the case of extending the lockdown.</strong> He said the government would be responding on Thursday. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman said government advisers were reviewing policy on whether members of the public should wear masks. </strong>The group looking at this is \u201cNervtag\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/new-and-emerging-respiratory-virus-threats-advisory-group\">the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group,</a> the spokesman said.

We understand that participating countries may begin to receive PPE two weeks after orders are placed. Deliveries will be subject to the same demand pressures as all other procurement currently taking place. Participating in this scheme would not have allowed us to do anything that we have not been able to do ourselves.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman sidestepped questions about whether the government would hold a public inquiry into its handling of coronavirus</strong>. He said the government was focusing on tackling coronavirus. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As we progress through this pandemic, we are of course looking at any improvements that we can make and any lessons that we can learn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The PM\u2019s spokesman would not endorse a statement from Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, about the government being too slow to ramp up testing.</strong> On ITV last night Vallance said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the beginning, Public Health England got off to a good start in terms of testing to try and make sure they caught people coming in to the country with it.

He said there was nothing new to add about the condition of the PM, who is continuing his recovery at Chequers. He said the priority for the PM was for him to \u201crest and recover\u201d and that his medical team had advised him not to immediately return to work.

The government\u2019s policy response will also have substantial direct budgetary costs, but the measures should help limit the long-term damage to the economy and public finances \u2013 the costs of inaction would certainly have been higher ...</p> \n   <p>We do not attempt to predict how long the economic lockdown will last \u2013 that is a matter for the government, informed by medical advice. But, to illustrate some of the potential fiscal effects, we assume a three-month lockdown due to public health restrictions followed by another three-month period when they are partially lifted. For now, we assume no lasting economic hit.</p> \n   <p><strong>Real GDP</strong> falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Unemployment</strong> rises by more than 2 million to 10% in the second quarter, but then declines more slowly than GDP recovers.

The report says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The year-to-date analysis shows that, of deaths involving the coronavirus (Covid-19) up to week 14, 90.2% (3,716 deaths) occurred in hospital, with the remainder occurring in hospices (33 deaths), care homes (217 deaths) and private homes (136 deaths).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The problem with these figures, of course, is that they are probably more than two weeks out of date. The cut-off date was 11 days ago. But the figures are also based on information from registered death certificates, and on average they take five days to process.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T10:22:56.078Z\">at 11.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9570168f081a236f192eaa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T08:27:25.285Z\">9.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Coronavirus much more widespread in care homes than official figures suggests, says leading firm</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning.

  "<p>In the kind of quirk that wouldn\u2019t be out of place within its realism-on-the-edge-of-surrealism vibe, the 2015 post-apocalyptic TV sitcom The Last Man on Earth has just become the most philosophically relevant cultural product on the planet.</p> <p>The show\u2019s premise considers the future of humanity when the vast bulk of its number has been taken out by an uncontainable, invisible global virus. The series is the brainchild of comedian and Saturday Night Live alumnus Will Forte, who was its star, writer and first showrunner, and its genuinely original characters, unpredictable plots and quirky tone earned it a cult following. The cult, alas, was not enough to sustain production: it was cancelled after four seasons, at the height of a game-changing, end-of-season cliff-hanger, in 2018.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/14/kicking-and-screaming-noah-baumbachs-slacker-debut-is-a-nostalgic-bite-of-90s-reality\">Kicking and Screaming: Noah Baumbach\u2019s slacker debut is a nostalgic bite of 90s reality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This rude interruption to its narrative in no way diminishes my recommendation to watch it.

Returning alone to his home after criss-crossing the country painting the words \u201cAlive in Tucson\u201d on highway billboards, Miller takes up residence in an abandoned mansion.

But online video doesn\u2019t come naturally to everybody. We asked three pros for advice to anyone getting started.</p> <h2><strong>Keep it snappy</strong></h2> <p>Derek Laney, head of solutions and product marketing at Salesforce, says that \u201cwhenever you\u2019re doing something online, you need to be thinking in a different way\u201d.</p> <p>Laney runs webinars and other online events for the customer-relationship management business. His main tips for what works for online: get straight to the point, keep it short and shake things up where possible. \u201cThe standard for online is 20 minutes or less,\u201d he says. \u201cTen minutes is better. If you can do it in a two-minute explainer, that\u2019s even better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/24/five-video-conference-grooming-tips-its-really-whats-above-the-desk-that-counts\">Five video conference grooming tips: 'It's really what's above the desk that counts'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you simply need more time, think about cutting it up into chunks. \u201cYou could do a 10-minute presentation, then a 10-minute workshop, then a 10-minute Q&amp;A \u2026 It\u2019s like a teacher in a classroom. A good teacher doesn\u2019t talk at their students for an hour.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>You don\u2019t need a fancy camera</strong></h2> <p>The good news is it\u2019s easy to get started. YouTube star Josiah \u201cJazza\u201d Brooks, whose <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DrawWithJazza/videos\">art tutorials</a> have amassed 5m subscribers, says \u201cyour phone is absolutely enough!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe great thing about your phone is \u2026 if you\u2019re in a poorly lit environment, it will detect where your face is and bring you out. A DSLR can\u2019t do that. They rely on you setting it up.\u201d<br><br>You\u2019ve also got to make some basic decisions about where the video is going. Comedian and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zj-eQFam5-s&amp;feature=youtu.be\">YouTuber</a> Natalie Tran says: \u201cIf you\u2019re uploading on a site [like Facebook or YouTube, rather than posting live stories] it\u2019s probably best to film in 16x9 [landscape], otherwise you end up with blank space around the video.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sound is everything (but lighting helps)</strong></h2> <p>\u201cPeople hate bad audio a lot more than they hate bad visuals,\u201d Brooks says. \u201cGet yourself a decent microphone \u2013 you can get something great for $20 \u2013 then test it and fine-tune it.\u201d Trial which room of your house creates the best sound and how far away the mic should be. If you have to move around a lot for the video, wireless earbuds are also a good alternative.</p> <p>\u201cAs long as your sound is good, you can at least get your message across,\u201d says Tran. \u201cIf you can see what\u2019s happening on screen because of good lighting, even better. You\u2019ve nailed it. Five stars.\u201d</p> <p>The trick with lighting is to put the camera in front of a light source \u2013 like a window or a lamp. \u201cWhen you have light behind you, it tends to silhouette your face. You can, however, look like an angel when light is behind you so you win some, you lose some.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Look right down the lens</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than watching a presentation where someone\u2019s looking at their slides and you have to watch their bald spot,\u201d says Laney. Also bad: checking yourself out the whole time in the camera. \u201cYou really need to look right down the lens \u2026 You need to reach through the lens, to make a real personal connection with someone on the other side.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re having way too much trouble with this, an alternative is a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerryweissman/2016/03/20/how-to-present-a-fireside-chat-in-4-easy-lessons/#7c129ce74951\">fireside chat</a>\u201d, where you have a couple of people in frame talking and occasionally turning to the camera to address the viewer. \u201cThen the audience feels like the third person in the conversation,\u201d Laney says.</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself</strong></h2> <p>Being on camera is hard for everyone at first. \u201cTry not to be too critical of yourself while filming or watching back what you\u2019ve filmed,\u201d Tran says. \u201cIt can be hard and uncomfortable, I know. But be nice to yourself.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhUEcAIhJ5U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xhUEcAIhJ5U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Natalie Tran\u2019s Awkward Photo Hands video, on what to do with your hands in pictures. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cIf you do it and do it and do it, it becomes comfortable,\u201d Brooks adds. \u201c[You have to] get comfortable making mistakes\u201d. Remember: the videos you\u2019re comparing yourself to are someone else\u2019s final cut \u2013 it\u2019s probably only 10% of what they originally recorded. \u201cI stuff up all the bloody time, I\u2019m just used to it!\u201d</p> <h2>Consistency is key</h2> <p>If you\u2019re trying to build an audience from scratch, it\u2019s going to be tough. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be ready to make content for years and years with no audience. You have to prove yourself through the fires of the internet.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/26/ace-facetime-how-to-impress-in-a-webcam-interview\">Ace FaceTime: how to impress in a webcam interview</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The key is consistency, Brooks says. \u201cI\u2019m going to pass a billion views this year and I\u2019ve never had a viral video. I\u2019ve done over 11,000 videos over eight years \u2026 It\u2019s all about providing content people want, doing it because it\u2019s something you\u2019re passionate about and making sure that carries through \u2013 and being really bloody persistent.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Practise being authentic</strong></h2> <p>It sounds counterintuitive, but it takes practice to be yourself on camera. So many people snap into \u201cpresenter\u201d mode or cramp up. \u201cYou\u2019re not practising for King Lear,\u201d Laney says. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to make it approachable: it\u2019s you on a good day. That\u2019s what you\u2019re after.\u201d A handy way of practising is to first do more video calls with family and friends.</p> <p>Think of a video as a conversation with a friend, Brooks says. \u201cPeople tune in to people online because they feel a connection. It\u2019s just about being honest.\u201d<br><br></p>",

What you objectively and accurately record is what they do. What you expected or wanted them to do are questions that may or may not be answered.\u201d</p> <p>So, too, with viruses. Instead of trying to make the viruses\u2019 behaviour fit magic curves, we must change to fit the behaviour of the viruses, which is why personal protection is so vital and works. Look at the graphs, follow the science. The safety factor difference between highest spec FFP3/N95 and standard surgical mask (EN14683), except in high virus density situations such as intensive care units, is small (see Leung et al. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0843-2\" title=\"\">Nature Medicine</a>).</p> <p>The statement that the general wearing of masks has no part to play in ending the epidemic is false.

  "<p>Poland\u2019s parliament will this week discuss a controversial proposal to tighten abortion laws in the country, as opposition politicians and women\u2019s rights groups warn that the country\u2019s conservative government may use the distraction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic to push through the legislation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland\">Poland</a> already has some of the strictest legislation in Europe on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a>, and previous attempts to tighten the laws further were abandoned after mass protests in 2016. The proposal comes from a citizen initiative, and it is unclear if the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party will support it, but president Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, has said he would sign the law if it reaches his desk.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, this is the best time to pay the debts they have to ultra-conservative groups,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, an opposition MP who was active in the protests four years ago. \u201cWe are really afraid that they will use the fact that citizens of Poland are really focused on their future and health right now, and not on values, sexual education, women rights.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, dozens of women protested in central Warsaw, in cars and on bicycles, honking horns and displaying posters against the law. Police used megaphones to warn protesters they risked fines for breaking lockdown regulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dbea90a1d544d5cc87b9437bdc582cc506194f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dbea90a1d544d5cc87b9437bdc582cc506194f5/0_348_5626_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman rides her bicycle during a protest of Polish women\u2019s rights activists in Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman rides her bicycle in Warsaw during a protest by Polish women\u2019s rights activists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wojtek Radwa\u0144ski/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Polish proposal comes amid global concerns over access to abortion during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Amnesty International called on governments across Europe to ease \u201conerous administrative requirements to access abortion services\u201d, which it said was making safe access difficult.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Marie Stopes International <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-may-deny-95-million-women-access-to-family-planning\">estimated</a> that there could be as many as 3 million additional unintended pregnancies and 2.7 million unsafe abortions in the 37 countries in which it works, as well as 11,000 pregnancy-related deaths.</p> <p>In Poland, abortion is already illegal except in cases of rape, incest, severe foetal abnormalities or in cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk. In 2016, a citizen\u2019s bill aimed to outlaw even these types of abortion, leading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/polish-government-performs-u-turn-on-total-abortion-ban\">to huge protests in towns and cities across the country</a>. The government backed away from its support.</p> <p>The bill was re-submitted in a less severe form in 2018, seeking to outlaw abortions in the case of foetal abnormalities. It has since been stalled in parliament but is now due for mandatory review, with discussions expected on Wednesday and Thursday. Some have suggested that this is merely a formality, and they are not expecting the government to push the law through quickly. Others, however, fear the difficulty of protest during the coronavirus pandemic could provide the perfect cover.</p> <p>There have been protests online, and with people hanging flags in their windows. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t have the same impact as a massive protest on the streets,\u201d said Nowacka.</p> <p>In an interview with a Catholic news outlet earlier this month, president Duda said \u201ckilling disabled children is simply murder\u201d and promised he would sign the law if it reached him. Duda is up for re-election next month, a vote the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/polish-government-still-planning-to-hold-presidential-election\">controversially insisting will go ahead</a>, despite the restrictions in place due to the pandemic. PiS has courted a conservative, Catholic voter base with rightwing rhetoric against abortion rights, LGBT rights and so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d.</p> <p>Natalia Broniarczyk, of the Abortion Dream Team organisation, said that even without the new legislation, the coronavirus pandemic has made life harder for women seeking abortion. The organisation\u2019s helpline has received around 550 calls in the month since lockdown was imposed in Poland, which is twice as much as during a usual month.</p> <p>Many Polish women with pregnancies in the first trimester are able to get around the current legislation by ordering pills online for medical abortion at home. Some women were concerned at whether the postal service would still function to deliver pills, while others were considering abortions due to the unexpected difficult economic situation.</p> <p>\u201cMany people lost their job from one day to the next and they don\u2019t have money even to live. For them, an unwanted pregnancy is the worst scenario,\u201d Broniarczyk said. Some Polish women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/pro-choice-activists-launch-abortion-initiative-in-poland\">travel abroad for abortions</a>, something which has also become extremely difficult due to recently imposed travel restrictions.</p> <p>Rights groups have warned the Polish government not to support the new legislation. \u201cThe chaos and anxiety surrounding Covid-19 shouldn\u2019t be used as a distraction from harmful attempts to push through dangerous legislation,\u201d said Hillary Margolis, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p>",
  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> on Tuesday include:</p> <h2>IMF predicts steepest downturn since the 1930s</h2> <p>The International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-near-2-million-trump-repeats-who-funding-threat-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e95b6a08f082a2cd32a67ef#block-5e95b6a08f082a2cd32a67ef\">slashes its forecasts for global growth</a> and warns of a slump in output this year unparalleled since the Great Depression of the 30s.

  "<p>\u201cHow do you change the world? Bring people together. Where is the easiest big place to bring people together? In the work environment,\u201d WeWork\u2019s messianic former CEO and co-founder Adam Neumann once said.</p> <p>With most offices shut down across the US, and Neumann pushed out of the company after its spectacular failure to go public last year, the notion of bringing people together in a work environment now seems quaint at best and potentially dangerous.</p> <p>As WeWork\u2019s board meets on Tuesday the question is what to do with millions of square feet of office space as the company is deserted by both its financial backer and tenants. The larger question is whether the co-working company can ever recover.</p> <p>WeWork is still open for business despite New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s coronavirus-mitigation edict to close all non-essential businesses. The company, which has shed thousands of jobs, could now be headed into a new phase of economic destruction as it seeks rent holidays from landlords but resists passing them on to struggling tenant businesses.</p> <p>As it has for countless companies across many sectors, the Covid-19 pandemic has emphasized the underlying weaknesses of WeWork\u2019s business model to lease commercial properties long-term and sublet to thousands of small or new-economy businesses on the short-term \u2013 a strategy that\u2019s never been tested by an economic downturn and certainly not by a global economic shutdown.</p> <p>The company hasn\u2019t paid April rent for some locations and has approached landlords for rent stays or revenue-sharing agreements. WeWork has kept its locations open \u2013 though in practice its locations are empty of tenants \u2013 and continues to charge clients.</p> <p>It\u2019s a practice that New York WeWork tenant Mark Macias said is in open disregard of Cuomo\u2019s executive order. \u201cAre you joking? Are you tone-deaf? Do you not see where we are? We\u2019re in the epicenter of the pandemic,\u201d Macias said he told his WeWork liaison.</p> <p>In April, Macias said, he wrote to WeWork revoking their authority to deduct rent from his account and informed the company that he would reinstate the order once the governor\u2019s order was lifted. But WeWork has continued to charge his account, he said, and offered only to halve his rent for April and May if he signed a one-year contract.</p> <p>\u201cFor them to even pretend that essential workers are in this building is a lie,\u201d Macias told The Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to be in this building. The governor says non-essential businesses will be fined, and there\u2019s no way they can argue these are essential businesses. They\u2019re just keeping it open so they can bill people.\u201d</p> <p>While most other firms, from credit cards to car lease companies, are working with struggling clients, \u201cWeWork is just focused on itself. It\u2019s ridiculous. It claims to be a community group but they\u2019re blatantly disregarding the health of the community for the sake of profits,\u201d said Macias.</p> <p>Marcelo Claure, WeWork\u2019s executive chairman, and Sandeep Mathrani, CEO, wrote in an email to employees that the company has \u201can obligation to keep our buildings open\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeWork/status/1241761778935173125\">full-page ad taken out in the New York Times</a> WeWork thanked customers providing \u201cservices to tackle Covid-19 and all those helping the wider community\u201d.</p> <p>Last week, WeWork, which lost $2bn last year, sued its principal investor, the multibillion investment fund SoftBank, for abandoning a $3bn share buyout agreed in October as part of a $10bn bailout designed to shore up the company\u2019s financials in exchange for an 80% stake.</p> <p>WeWork\u2019s board said SoftBank and its CEO, Masayoshi Son, are now suffering from \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d. In its response, SoftBank argued that WeWork failed to fulfill conditions required to complete the deal, including the existence of pending criminal and civil investigations.</p> <p>SoftBank called the lawsuit \u201ca desperate and misguided attempt\u201d to rewrite an agreement that would have furnished Neumann with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/22/wework-board-weighs-up-10bn-rescue-plan-from-softbank\">near billion-dollar windfall</a>. The company noted that Neumann, his family and Benchmark Capital would have benefited the most from the arrangement since their equity made up \u201cmore than half of the stock tendered in the offering\u201d.</p> <p>The collapse of the deal means Neumann\u2019s fortune has dropped 97% to $450m from $13.5bn in less than a year, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/\" title=\"Bloomberg Billionaires Index\">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>. The pain is broadly shared: on Monday, SoftBank said it expects to record an investment loss of 1.8tn yen \u2013 or $16.6bn \u2013 at its $100bn Vision Fund for the year, plus a further 800bn yen on its WeWork and OneWeb investments.</p> <p>Analysts say WeWork\u2019s fall from grace \u2013 it is currently worth less than 10% of the $47bn it was valued at last summer, when the company published a highly flawed sale prospectus that triggered an investor revolt \u2013 is a warning for the commercial real estate market as tenants seek to unwind agreements and investors head for the doors, threatening a $16tn market and $4.5tn in mortgage debt secured by it.</p> <p>In Manhattan,<a href=\"https://www.us.jll.com/en/trends-and-insights/research/office-market-statistics-trends\"> according to the brokerage firm JLL</a>, new office leasing volume fell 47% in the first quarter.</p> <p>Work-share companies like WeWork accounted for 6.5% of new leases in the US in the first six month of 2019, according to the brokerage CBRE Group, with pre-Covid-19 high estimates pushing the share to 22% by 2020. Those figures must now be in doubt, say analysts and investors.</p> <p>\u201cFor late-stage startups like WeWork and Airbnb, the pandemic is having a significant impact on their business models,\u201d said Mike Jones at the Santa Monica, California-based investment firm Science Inc. \u201cEven if their businesses had been hyper-profitable, they\u2019d be super-challenged right now.\u201d</p> <p>But there has also been a leveling between those companies and their traditional peers, Jones points out. \u201cI don\u2019t know if WeWork or Airbnb\u2019s ability to sustain this market change is any better than for incumbent industries, like airlines or physical retail.\u201d</p> <p>But, Jones warns, the era of endless rounds of venture capital funding may not survive the turbulence of the markets, and bring to a stop the era of the unprofitable unicorn which has been under threat at least since the disappointments of Uber\u2019s and WeWork\u2019s IPO experiences last year.</p> <p>\u201cIn a world of plentiful venture capital, market share and growth-at-all-costs becomes a favourable way of operating because you can sustain your losses with new rounds of capital,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in a world of restricted venture capital, a path to a self-sustaining business model is much more important.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he says, the crisis could have a silver lining allowing more nimble, low cash-burning companies to come in, like Zoom, who are able to take advantage of the turmoil. \u201cAt a minimum, we\u2019re going to see a major change in remote work and remote education. Companies that can establish themselves now in that pattern will not return to traditional methods.\u201d</p> <p>That in turn suggests that flexibility in terms of physical location will become more desirable, rendering the traditional, long-lease office irrelevant for many companies \u2013 and that could play into the hands of companies like WeWork, Jones adds.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea of a short-term, transitory office space becomes a better idea than a five-year, loss-lease office space. So WeWork\u2019s approach and methodology to office is fundamentally better than traditional office space. WeWork will be impacted negatively by people working from home, but the impact on traditional real estate could be greater.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>We are months into a global pandemic and on the internet, where shaming thrives, social distance shaming is at a high.</p> <p>Yesterday, Guardian journalist Amelia Gentleman highlighted some peak social distance shaming when she tweeted a photo of someone\u2019s window plastered with posters revealing that their upstairs neighbor was a social-distance shirker. She asked a simple question: \u201cIs this a bit mean?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ameliagentleman/status/1249763305817804801\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is this a bit mean? <a href=\"https://t.co/4pEwAc6CEO\">pic.twitter.com/4pEwAc6CEO</a></p>&mdash; amelia gentleman (@ameliagentleman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ameliagentleman/status/1249763305817804801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The answer is, it\u2019s complicated. Many social distance shamers are simply trying to do the right thing. \u201cGo home!\u201d one New Yorker yelled <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/16/nyc-man-yells-at-people-to-go-home-help-flatten-the-curve-amid-coronavirus/\">from</a> a fire exit recently, adding: \u201cYou could be spreading it right now, yeah, you with the gas mask,\u201d above a crowded street in Brooklyn.</p> <p>And so he should: because for every person who feels safe outside at the moment, there is another who is immunocompromised; who doesn\u2019t have healthcare; or is just a good human being who worries about what happens to people if the curve of this pandemic is not flattened. In states like New York, where stay-at-home orders are advisory rather than enforced and people stretch their definition of \u201cessential\u201d to include hourly walks and buying cookies, couldn\u2019t people do with a little reminding?</p> <p>But of course, not everyone can work from home, which makes taking to the streets with a megaphone a pretty ambiguous task. How to pick out those in the crowd who are jerks, from those who are traveling to work so you can have your groceries this week? What about those visiting elderly family members to drop off medication; or going out for their first bit of fresh air in weeks?</p> <p>\u201cSo Jen and I obviously have to walk the dog,\u201d begins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ijustine/status/1240059292314513408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1240059292314513408&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheweek.com%2Farticles%2F904078%2Fpublic-shame-rescue\">another recent viral</a> post by vlogger Justine Ezarik, then, she points at some people playing basketball in the park \u201cCan you not?!\u201d she yells into her phone. Playing basketball is undoubtedly one of the silliest things you could be doing right now (think of the number of surfaces being touched!) but it wasn\u2019t long before the Twitter pile-on began. People asked Ezarik how many times the dog had been walked today; where her face mask was; and whether she should even be out in the first place. Ezarik couldn\u2019t get a mask in her local area, plus she had been trying to walk the dog less, she responded. But it\u2019s a reminder that when we approach others with cynicism, everyone \u2013 even the finger pointer among us \u2013 could become a potential wrongdoer.</p> <p>Some of the social distance shaming, it has to be said, is a symptom of another thing: Britain and the US do like their curtain-twitchers (the US created neighborhood watch, remember?). Since the Stay At Home badge was released on Instagram, my stories feed feels like a monotonous reel of people cycling through the park, pointing at <em>all of the other people in the park</em>, asking why they aren\u2019t social distancing. People, after all, are very good at giving themselves the benefit of the doubt, but don\u2019t extend the courtesy to others.</p> <p>Others have taken to the neighbor-to-neighbor platform Nextdoor, AKA curtain-twitcher heaven, to point the finger at everyone, from <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/26/nextdoor-coronavirus-nicer/\">joggers to children playing on the street</a>. \u201cPARENTS, WHERE ARE YOU?\u201d a<a href=\"https://coloradosun.com/2020/04/01/social-media-shaming-about-coronavirus/\"> recent post asked</a>.

It\u2019s not just that songs seem to have taken on new, apposite resonances given the current situation, but music that you unexpectedly find yourself leaning towards, because you find it chimes with your mood: it\u2019s comforting, elevating or transporting. I speak as someone who recently spent an admittedly tipsy evening listening to what a friend called mumcore: the kind of music parents gravitated toward when I was a kid, somewhere on the cusp of chart pop and easy listening. I can\u2019t profess any great personal passion for Dr Hook\u2019s When You\u2019re in Love With a Beautiful Woman or Marti Webb\u2019s Take That Look Off Your Face, but at that particular moment it sounded reassuring, a little wallow in nostalgia for a time when I had nothing to worry about.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvvGYEjloOg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvvGYEjloOg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In fairness, there isn\u2019t much data to suggest that listeners\u2019 habits have changed. The Official Charts company suggest that we got through the <a href=\"https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uks-official-lockdown-listening-list-the-classic-songs-enjoying-an-unexpected-resurgence__29221/\">first week of lockdown</a> with a combination of gallows humour \u2013 surges in popularity for REM\u2019s It\u2019s the End of the World As We Know It and the Police\u2019s Don\u2019t Stand So Close to Me \u2013 and inspirational anthems such as Imagine and You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. However, the <a href=\"https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/\">UK singles chart</a> is the same as usual: Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, Harry Styles and the Weeknd.</p> <p>The album charts are filled with the kind of best-of collections that seem to enjoy such permanent residence there you wonder who\u2019s still buying them: how can anyone who wants to hear the greatest hits of Queen, Fleetwood Mac or Elton John not already own them? There\u2019s a vague intimation about the streaming figures on Spotify that parents of a certain age are home more than usual and listening to Wonderwall and Dancing in the Moonlight by Toploader, but there\u2019s nothing in the way of major anomalies, beyond a boost in streams for the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-songwriter-bob-dylan-johnny-cash-bruce-springsteen\">John Prine</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps this is all evidence that music is fulfilling a keep-calm-and-carry-on function at the moment \u2013 normality in a wildly abnormal world \u2013 but I think it\u2019s more likely evidence that the charts deal in broad brushstrokes and the kind of response I\u2019m talking about is unique and personal. If, as Zoe Williams <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/why-are-we-talking-about-morrissey-and-buffy-because-cultural-nostalgia-is-now-king\">recently suggested</a>, lockdown means that, culturally, \u201cwe are all basically living out of the store cupboard \u2013 all the music and literature and thought-paraphernalia you have carelessly stashed over the past few decades\u201d, then everyone\u2019s stash of memories is bound to be different, particularly the stuff we find ourselves digging deep for, the stuff we find chimes more loudly with us than the standard-issue all-purpose crisis anthems such as Imagine or You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. So what\u2019s your experience? What music has struck you in a way you didn\u2019t anticipate? And when this is all over, will you want to listen to it again?</p> <h2>We\u2019ll see a return to fantasy</h2> <p><strong>Laura Snapes, deputy music editor</strong></p> <p>Months before the coronavirus pandemic, pop stars were whispering about pivoting back to escapism. Trauma was wearing out its hold on the charts, especially since a generation of rappers had been wiped out by addiction, depression and gun violence. Feeble lyrics by major pop acts about feeling unpopular and awkward were wearing thin, while musicians venturing personal intimacies largely found them turned into grist for an unforgiving gossip mill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"05c0e6ef4b9c530e454671dc4e6e991531a17299\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05c0e6ef4b9c530e454671dc4e6e991531a17299/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Ocean performing at Parklife festival, 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank Ocean performing at Parklife festival, 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Visionhaus/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe expectation for artists to be vulnerable and truthful is a lot, you know, when it\u2019s no longer a choice,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.wmagazine.com/story/frank-ocean-cover-story-interview/\">Frank Ocean told W Magazine</a>. \u201cLike, in order for me to satisfy expectations, there needs to be an outpouring of my heart or my experiences in a very truthful, vulnerable way. I\u2019m more interested in lies than that. Like, give me a full motion-picture fantasy.\u201d And as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/03/dua-lipa-you-have-to-be-made-of-steel-to-not-let-words-get-to-you\">Dua Lipa was teasing what would turn out to be a pointedly escapist second album</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\">Lady Gaga</a> was threatening a return to the high-concept dance-pop that made her a star.</p> <p>The pandemic won\u2019t slow this shift. Once lockdown is over, after months of fear for everyone and far more grievous circumstances for many, the idea of having to relive this period via a glut of insular, anxious pop music just sounds like prolonging the agony. Although we\u2019ve quickly acclimatised to seeing grainy FaceTime feeds on national TV, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/livestreaming-beat-battles-lockdown-skepta-timabaland-self-isolating\">lo-fi beat battles through Instagram Live</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGwQZrDNLO8&amp;feature=emb_title\">music videos made on Zoom</a>, those homespun production values will only increase fans\u2019 hunger for the kind of high-end production you can\u2019t easily put together on the fly \u2013 especially if, as healthcare experts are suggesting, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/magazine/coronavirus-economy-debate.html?referringSource=articleShare\">live music and festivals might not realistically return until late 2021</a>. Transportive fantasias might be all we have.</p> <p>Perhaps it might shift fans\u2019 attitudes, too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/charli-xcx\">Charli XCX</a> has committed to producing an album, How I\u2019m Feeling Now, from scratch during lockdown, to be released on 15 May. She\u2019s working with producers AG Cook and BJ Burton, so it\u2019s not totally a one-woman show, but presumably the results will demonstrate the limitations of creating at speed. You\u2019d hope it might engender some patience and appreciation for craft from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/15/leave-rihanna-alone-a-manifesto-for-healthier-pop-fandom-in-the-2020s\">fans inclined to demand ever more music from their faves</a>. Maybe these straitened times will also help pop stars \u2013 especially women \u2013 refuse inessential elements of the job. In the New York Times profile of Lipa releasing her album in lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/music/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-coronavirus.html\">she remarked on how doing her own styling</a> for the paper\u2019s socially distanced photoshoot showed \u201ca very unfiltered version of yourself\u201d and let her spend longer in bed. (That Lipa is genetically blessed obviously helps.)</p> <p>Ultimately, pop will emerge from this period in better shape than less lucrative and exposed forms of music \u2013 though it\u2019s still going to be forced into new shapes by club culture. Dozens of clubs will close during this period; tour revenues for DJs will be destroyed. But dance music is the living embodiment of how necessity is the mother of invention. Perhaps more so than any other music community, club culture provides a lifeline for its often marginalised participants, and has a progressive social imperative at its heart: it will find new sounds and spaces and spring back, because it has to. (Plus, parties are far easier to organise at the drop of a hat \u2013 or the relaxing of a social distancing order \u2013 than a fully fledged festival.) You only have to look at the divide between the thrilling, emergent dance singles and lumpen, complacent pop in 1988 and 1989 to realise that the latter\u2019s contemporary catalysts would be foolish not to pay very close attention.</p> <h2>Rap will become more introverted</h2> <p><strong>Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor</strong></p> <p>So much of the grist for mainstream rap lyricshas been ruined by coronavirus. The club? Closed. Rolls-Royce dealership? Furloughed. Sex with women who you aren\u2019t planning to self-isolate with for more than 45 minutes? Now even more morally dubious. So what do you rap about?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/rappers-coronavirus-cardi-b-dj-imarkkeyz\">Lyrical lockdown: rappers respond to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like a bond market, the most shallow rap lyricism needs constant activity to keep it alive \u2013 without an engine of expenditure, or antipathy stoked by confected beef, their subject matter collapses. Once we get past a month of lockdown and jittery boredom sets in, we could get a wave of old grievances aired and rappers \u201csending\u201d for one another on social media. Also, like a bond market, rap lyrics can deal in money itself rather than anything material or social underpinning it, and as we nose into recession, these tracks may well go from being aspirational or enjoyably dumb to grating.</p> <p>Existing rap tracks have been tainted by the virus \u2013 Future\u2019s Mask Off now sounds like it\u2019s about a reckless approach to PPE rather than emotional availability \u2013 and the lexicon of the virus itself will, of course, find its way into rhymes. Tracks will be heralded as catchier than it; women\u2019s legs will depressingly be \u201cspread like coronavirus\u201d; someone, somewhere, has hesitantly entered \u201cho vid?\u201d into their iPhone notes. One of my favourite tweets over the last month was by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EasyStreetKeys/status/1240094152118894594\">@EasyStreetKeys, who wrote</a>: \u201cDrake somewhere in the booth singing, \u2018I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re social distancing or distancing yourself from me socially\u2019\u201d \u2013 the joke being that the Canadian rapper is permanently given to brooding on toxic relationships, and a global pandemic isn\u2019t likely to change that.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW71FKXQwSY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EW71FKXQwSY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That mooted Drake lyric also shows how the interiority of the coronavirus experience \u2013 where we\u2019re stuck inside our own heads as well as houses \u2013 could be creatively stimulating and a boon for rap fans. You can imagine how a rapper given to self-examination like Polo G might already be writing affecting and emotional material; the political material for acts such as Dave or Run the Jewels is also in abundance. But rappers previously given to extroversion \u2013 because that was what they felt the culture demanded of them \u2013 could also find a new side to their artistry. There are rappers addressing the crisis head on, like Psychs\u2019 UK drill track Spreadin or Lady Leshurr\u2019s fitfully amusing Quarantine Speech, but this all feels a bit on the nose. It\u2019ll be the ones who have finally found time to work out who they are that will be most worth listening to.</p>",

It\u2019s important that the objectives are set.\u201d</p> <p>About 500 firefighters struggled for 15 hours to prevent the fire spreading from the roof to the two belfry towers housing the cathedral bells. If the tower\u2019s wooden frames had caught fire it could have sent the bells \u2013 including the largest Emmanuel bell weighing 13 tonnes \u2013 crashing down and collapsed the entire structure.</p> <p>The fire was finally put out at 9.30am the following day. Two-thirds of the roof was destroyed, <em>la for\u00eat</em> was gone, part of the vaulted ceiling had collapsed and up to 400 tonnes of lead from the roof and spire had been reduced to dust, part of it dispersed to the wind \u2013 but Notre Dame was still standing.</p> <p>Macron immediately promised the shocked nation that the cathedral would be reborn in five years. \u201cWe will rebuild this cathedral.

The captain told them this was a record.</p> <p>After deadly Covid-19 outbreaks on at least 10 cruise liners \u2013 including the Diamond Princess and Ruby Princess, which are in the same <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_Corporation_%26_plc\">Carnival conglomerate</a> as the Arcadia \u2013 disembarking passengers are likely to be greeted with as much suspicion as sympathy. Even before the pandemic, cruises were viewed with hostility in some quarters because they were associated with the wealthy.</p> <p>But in Simon and Kerry\u2019s case, the opposite was true. They had racked up debt so they could pay \u00a336,000 for the cruise. Simon was borrowing from his future so Kerry would have a present beyond the usual confines of her bedroom. It was part of a strategy of investing in happy memories to tide them through the tough times of her degenerative condition.</p> <p>The multiple sclerosis had revealed itself 18 years ago when Kerry suddenly could not take her foot off the accelerator pedal during a holiday in Devon. The couple, then living in Hertfordshire, narrowly avoided an accident, but could not escape the life-changing diagnosis that followed. Simon\u2019s first response was to propose marriage so he could assure Kerry she would not be alone as her condition worsened. They both worked as bank clerks, and spent the next two years saving for a spectacular wedding in a Scottish castle so they would have special photos to look back on. Kerry \u2013 a self-proclaimed \u201cEssex girl\u201d, with a cheeky grin and a ribald sense of humour \u2013 led the ceilidh dancing. To his friends\u2019 astonishment, Simon \u2013 a somewhat laconic son of Sri Lankan immigrants who was more comfortable listening to the Cure \u2013 joined in.</p> <p>In the years that followed, Kerry had to use a stick more often, then a wheelchair. In 2016, Simon decided to quit the bank so he could become her full-time nurse. They sold their house in the London commuter belt and bought a cheaper home in Lincolnshire so they would have enough to live on until their pension. Kerry was increasingly bed-bound and in need of medication to dull her pain. The couple could no longer afford annual holidays. Instead, they planned a round-the-world cruise with the lump-sum early retirement payment that was due in 2023.</p> <p>But with Kerry\u2019s condition deteriorating fast, Simon realised that might be too late. Going behind his wife\u2019s back for the first time in their marriage, he secretly made preparations to remortgage their home so they could go on the trip early. He knew it was a financial risk, but \u2013 like their wedding \u2013 he felt they could live on the memories it would create. Before going ahead, he got up the courage to tell his wife what he had done.</p> <p>\u201cShe looked at me stunned, asked me to repeat myself and then burst into tears,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t handle crying people well, but it turned out they were tears of joy. What a relief!\u201d</p> <p>Kerry perked up. In the following months, she excitedly planned what to wear at each stage of the cruise and what sights they would see. Adding to Simon\u2019s happiness was the prospect of three months in which the crew and medical staff of the ship would partly relieve him of nursing and cooking duties. He decided he would share highlights of the voyage with friends by posting a simple haiku and photographs on Facebook at each destination, and compiling a cruise playlist on Spotify.</p> <p>Neither imagined, as they set sail in January, that escaping confinement from one disease would lead to quarantine because of another. The following account of their voyage \u2013 compiled from Simon\u2019s diary, social media posts and messages, and media reports \u2013 shows how the pandemic caught up with them.</p> <h2>3 January \u2013 Southampton</h2> <p>A fireworks display accompanies Arcadia\u2019s departure from port. Few, if any, of the 2,388 passengers know that four days earlier, China informed the World Health Organization that an as yet unnamed virus had broken out in Wuhan. The trip will mark Simon and Kerry\u2019s 15th wedding anniversary. \u201cWatch out world!\u201d Simon posts on Facebook along with a first haiku: \u201cSouthampton, \u2018Hello\u2019, Beginning of adventure, Hoping for calm seas.\u201d</p> <h2>15 January \u2013 Cura<strong>\u00e7</strong>ao, Caribbean</h2> <p>After crossing the Atlantic, Simon and Kerry have a health concern, but not about Covid-19. They still haven\u2019t heard of the disease, although it has now taken two lives in Wuhan, and spread to several countries, including Thailand, the US and South Korea. The British couple\u2019s worry is that Kerry feels pain in her foot. It turns out to be cellulitis, an infection that could cut the journey short because her immune system is weak. The ship\u2019s doctors prescribe antibiotics and warn that she may have to disembark for possible amputation if the symptoms worsen. \u201cI feel numb,\u201d Simon writes.</p> <h2>27 January \u2013 San Francisco</h2> <p>The antibiotics take effect and Kerry\u2019s foot clears up as the ship passes through the Panama canal. By the time they reach San Francisco, she is well enough to enjoy the sights of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz. Inside the happy bubble of the ship, there is still no inkling of coronavirus, although the disease is spreading wider. Several US airports have begun to screen passengers from Wuhan, but cruise liners are considered safe. That is about to change.</p> <h2>3 February \u2013 Hawaii</h2> <p>After almost a week at sea without free internet, passengers reconnect at Hawaii between outings to second world war memorials. They are almost halfway across the Pacific to Asia, where cases are rising exponentially. But the outbreak is still barely on the radar. \u201cIf the coronavirus had been in the news it passed me by,\u201d Simon writes.</p> <h2>4 February \u2013 Mid-Pacific</h2> <p>While the Arcadia is at sea, another vessel in the Carnival conglomerate of cruise line companies \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/06/inside-the-cruise-ship-that-became-a-coronavirus-breeding-ground-diamond-princess\">the Diamond Princess</a> \u2013 is quarantined in Japan after more than 100 passengers are found to be sick with Covid-19. This leads to heightened concerns about the risk of outbreaks on other vessels. In the following days, the captain of the Arcadia informs passengers that the Asian leg of the world tour has been cancelled. Instead they will spend more time in Australia and New Zealand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c528f7e8c0175a702dfc2d7bc9802e2242aa719e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c528f7e8c0175a702dfc2d7bc9802e2242aa719e/0_338_3497_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon and Kerry come face to face with a koala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon and Kerry come face to face with a koala during one of their excursions in Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>11 February \u2013 Polynesia</h2> <p>Kerry gets a cake and a card from the captain for her birthday. The itinerary is changed again. A planned stop in Tonga is scuppered by an outbreak of measles on the island, so the Arcadia diverts to Tahiti. Coronavirus still feels a distant threat, although it has almost taken a thousand lives around the world. Passengers are more worried about sunburn.</p> <h2>11 March \u2013 Freemantle, Australia</h2> <p>New Zealand and Australia mark the high point of the trip for the British couple. They love shore excursions to Auckland and Sydney. At Tauranga, on New Zealand\u2019s North Island, Simon says people are so laid-back that he would like to live among them. In Brisbane, Kelly is thrilled to hug a koala. Simon revels in the landscape around Hobart, Tasmania. \u201cWords cannot convey, Breathtakingly scenic views, Mount Wellington, thanks,\u201d he posts on social media. But the pandemic is creeping closer. In Perth, Western Australia, they hear that one or two new passengers have failed health screening tests and have been refused permission to board. They set sail from Freemantle at 7.42pm on 11 March, hours before the World Health Organization declares coronavirus a pandemic. As a result, it will be 30,000km before they are allowed on dry land.</p> <h2>12-21 March \u2013 Indian Ocean</h2> <p>\u201cFrom then on we seem to have lurched from disaster to disaster,\u201d Simon recalls. The Arcadia is refused permission to land in Sri Lanka due to the coronavirus lockdown. This was to have been a big moment for the couple. Simon\u2019s parents emigrated from Sri Lanka in 1966, the year before he was born. He was taking his wife to meet his relatives there for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Simon writes. \u201cIt is hard to put into words the disappointment. This is probably the last chance for this type of meeting \u2013 financially, it is unlikely we could afford to do this again and, physically, I\u2019m not sure Kerry will be able to.\u201d Other setbacks follow. Dubai and Malta close their ports, meaning the ship has to divert from the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean. \u201cOur world cruise is shrinking,\u201d Simon writes. \u201cEach new day seems to bring bad news \u2026 Cruise ships have become the pariahs of the world. Nobody wants us to dock.\u201d</p> <h2>22 March \u2013 Durban, South Africa</h2> <p>By the time the ship reaches the Horn of Africa, the pandemic has taken 30,000 lives worldwide. There are still no cases of Covid-19 on the ship, which means it can fly a yellow (sickness-free) flag, but passengers have to practise physical distancing and sit apart from one another at dinner. Anxieties and frustrations have crept into conversations. These rise to a pitch when the Arcadia is denied permission to evacuate passengers from Durban and then forced to wait five days to refuel and resupply. Simon begins to fear Kerry may not have enough medicine if they are held up much longer. Without the right pills, the pain would kick in and her physical deterioration would accelerate. They finally dock on 26 March but only three South Africans are permitted ashore.</p> <h2>29 March \u2013 Atlantic Ocean</h2> <p>The ship is on its way back to the UK. Restrictions on board are tightened. The couple spend more time in their cabin. With one last refuelling stop in Tenerife, the focus is now on home, where relatives and friends are in lockdown and more than a thousand people have died. Simon asks a neighbour to buy groceries so the fridge will not be empty when they return home. He is surprised by how difficult it has become to buy online \u2013 a sign of how out-of-touch the ship is. \u201cBizarrely, fruit and veg is plentiful but loo roll is out of stock \u2013 I think people have their priorities wrong,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92934ed662c47cecf25b2e69059038494224875b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92934ed662c47cecf25b2e69059038494224875b/0_32_3159_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arcadia at Southampton docks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arcadia at Southampton docks \u2013 for its naming ceremony in April 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>12 April \u2013 Southampton</h2> <p>The Arcadia docks in Southampton, the last of P&amp;O\u2019s fleet to return home. The usual fanfare welcome is absent. The passengers \u2013 who have spent 72 days of the 99-day cruise at sea \u2013 have to disembark in stages to ensure physical distancing rules are maintained. They have effectively been in quarantine for 31 days, but they have to be briefed about the changes they must adapt to on a land transformed. Since they set off in early January, the virus has killed more than 110,000 people. The UK is now a hotspot with almost one in 10 of those deaths. They are given a letter from the captain in case police stop them on the way home, and they have been warned they now have to take special precautions just to go to the shops.</p> <p>Simon and Kerry know it could be a lot worse. Their story is one of frustration, not tragedy. They are grateful to be in one piece and to leave with a P&amp;O compensation voucher for a 33-day trip next year, which eases Simon\u2019s greatest concern that Kerry would end the trip with nothing to look forward to.</p> <p>They drive back to Lincolnshire in a car full of suitcases, heads crammed with conflicting memories and a future of a quarantine behind familiar walls.</p> <p>Simon finds time for a final haiku on Facebook. \u201cThe cruise is over, Thanks for the likes and wishes, Back to abnormal\u201d, and \u2013 expressing himself better in musical choices than words \u2013 a Spotify playlist. It starts with Once in a Lifetime by Talking Heads and Fantastic Voyage by David Bowie, then progresses towards Isolation by Joy Division and Ghost Town by the Specials. The final track is A Better Future by Bowie. In case anyone should think this last choice is uncharacteristically optimistic, he adds a caveat: \u201cImagine it as a question, rather than a statement.\u201d</p>",

They calculated the potential benefits by including the social welfare aspects of cutting emissions and of economic growth, which gives more weight than some other models to developing countries with large populations of poor and vulnerable people. They found that better international cooperation on emission would lead to better outcomes for such people, who are likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown.</p> <p>However, their findings also show such a strategy has greater benefits for developing countries with high emissions, such as India, Indonesia, Nigeria and China, than for developed countries such as the US and the EU in the medium term, though all benefit in the longer term.</p> <p>Their findings come at a critical time for governments around the world grappling with the coronavirus crisis, and its dire economic impacts.

All countries are supposed to come forward with improved national plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions this year, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/dec/02/climate-crisis-what-is-cop-and-can-it-save-the-world\">vital UN climate talks</a> aimed at keeping the Paris agreement on track.</p> <p>The UN and the UK government have been forced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/we-must-use-this-time-well-climate-experts-hopeful-after-cop26-delay-coronavirus\">delay the talks</a>, called Cop26, until next year. That gives governments more time to improve their national plans, called <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs\">nationally determined contributions</a> in the UN jargon, but so far there is little sign they are doing so. Only Japan and Chile, the host of last year\u2019s talks, among major countries have so far submitted fresh plans, and while Chile agreed to step up climate action, Japan\u2019s plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/30/campaigners-attack-japan-shameful-climate-plans-release\">showed no improvement</a>.</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson for Cop26 told the Guardian: \u201cWe welcome Chile\u2019s climate leadership as Cop25 president in submitting a strengthened emissions reduction target, and hope to see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/saving-the-planet-uk-role-vital-if-cop-26-climate-talks-to-succeed\">all countries following their lead</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Current climate plans showed that the rich world must do more, said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth. \u201cBudgets should be rebalanced to provide emergency finance and help poorer nations \u2013 it\u2019s the fair and right thing to do. If we don\u2019t pay now, this is the kind of bill that, like a person ignoring a credit card statement, will only multiply in time. </p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s the kind of expenditure that repays multiple benefits and should really be seen as a smart investment. As if stopping climate change isn\u2019t enough, it will deliver a better quality of life for more people around the world, faster.\u201d</p> <p>The economic benefits of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, compared with the high costs of reneging, should spur governments to act on the climate, according to the Nature study\u2019s authors. However, investments are needed to realise these gains, particularly from developed countries. The outlay would amount to between $5tn and $33tn for the US, and between $16tn and $105tn for the G20 countries as a whole.</p> <p>The study said: \u201cEarly and quick action will provide a better chance to close the widening emissions gap, even though a large amount of abatement cost would occur in the short term.\u201d</p>",

A few days later it peaked at a million-dollar sales per day.\u201d</p> <p>Owing to shelter-in-place restrictions across the country, families need more toilet paper at home. While previously they used the bathroom at work, school and restaurants, they are now going at home. The type of toilet paper in short supply are luxury brands \u2013 double-ply and made of virgin fiber \u2013 as opposed to the single-ply recycled paper that businesses tend to use.</p> <p>Rather than chasing rumors of where toilet paper was last seen on shelves, some millennials see purchasing a bidet as a kind of pandemic lifehack. Kaitlyn Braswell, a management analyst in Chicago who ordered hers a few days ago, is looking forward to what she describes as a new level of cleanliness. She only wishes she had ordered it sooner \u2013 it\u2019s expected to ship in mid-May.</p> <p>In Italy, where bidets are in every household, the American rush for toilet paper remains a mystery. It\u2019s completely unthinkable that Italian bathrooms would be without such an essential piece of equipment. As far back as 1975, a hygiene law stated: \u201cFor each accommodation, at least one bathroom must be equipped with the following sanitary facilities: toilet, bidet, bath or shower, washbasin.\u201d</p> <p>America\u2019s disdain for bidets has no clear basis. Douching was once thought to be a kind of birth control, and in 1936 an onlooker suggested that \u201cthe presence of a bidet is regarded as almost a symbol of sin\u201d, according to <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/03/the-bidets-revival/555770/\">the Atlantic</a>.

Trees are a carbon sink, and a (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21115862/davos-1-trillion-trees-controversy-world-economic-forum-campaign\">controversial</a>) <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/76\">study</a> published last year claimed the world has the capacity for at least another trillion trees, which could mitigate climate change. </p> <p>If Americans gave up toilet paper, they could keep 15m trees from being turned into pulp every year. Instead of deforesting Canada\u2019s boreal forest, one of the largest carbon stores on the planet would be preserved.</p> <p>Bidets can, surprisingly, also help conserve water. Manufacturing one roll of toilet paper requires 37 gallons of water, Scientific American has <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-talks-bidets/\">reported</a>. Some bidets, by comparison, use one-eighth of a gallon<strong> </strong>a flush.<strong> </strong>Also contributing to toilet paper\u2019s carbon footprint are the hundreds of thousands of tons of chlorine required to make toilet paper white, the energy required in the manufacturing process, the single-use plastic that it gets packaged in, and the fuel for shipping .</p> <p>Now quarantined at his house in Madison, Wisconsin, Josh Faulkes, manager of the Wisconsin Society of Cytology, said the pandemic has changed the bidet from a fantasy item to a necessity.</p> <p>\u201cThis situation moved the product from a \u2018one of these days\u2019 luxury item to a more practical purchase, up there with replacing our back door and changing our tires.\u201d</p> <p>Though he views ownership of a bidet as entirely practical, Faulkes is actually splashing out and getting one with warm water, a heated toilet seat and a warm air dryer.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually a birthday present,\u201d Faulkes confessed.

Even in the absence of a global pandemic, cruise ships are ideal incubators of infectious diseases.</p> <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/surv/gilist.htm\">investigate</a> about 13 outbreaks of gastrointestinal bugs like <em>E</em><em> coli</em> and <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cruise-ship-nightmare-after-measles-norovirus-outbreaks-why-does-anyone-ncna1043516\">norovirus</a> aboard cruise ships a year; influenza and chickenpox are also fairly common. Last May, measles broke out <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/scientology-cruise-ship-freewinds-passengers-cleared-measles-risk-church-says-n1005841\">aboard a Scientology cruise</a>. Yes, you can get sick anywhere, but according to Tara C Smith, professor of epidemiology at Kent State University, cruise ships <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/cruise-ship-nightmare-after-measles-norovirus-outbreaks-why-does-anyone-ncna1043516\">genuinely amplify</a> the risk of infection \u2013 in part because of the close quarters onboard, and in part because passengers are at the mercy of companies\u2019 hygienic standards. In 2019, Carnival Cruises <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-fantasy-cruise-ship-receives-failing-sanitation-score-2019-8\">failed</a> sanitation inspections for offenses including \u201cbrown water\u201d discharge from showers in the medical center and unclean food service utensils. Moreover, when you fall ill on a cruise you are dependent on contractor physicians who charge high fees regular health insurance is unlikely to cover.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A passenger\u2019s carbon footprint triples in size when taking a cruise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After investigating air quality on cruises, the Johns Hopkins University professor Ryan David Kennedy <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/24/health/cruise-ship-air-quality-report/index.html\">told CNN</a> their onboard air pollution was \u201ccomparable to concentrations measured in polluted cities, including Beijing and Santiago\u201d. Yet the health risks posed by cruise ship emissions do not only affect their passengers. As Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/04/26/cruise-ship-pollution-is-causing-serious-health-and-environmental-problems/#3c8bdbf337db\">reports</a>, a single cruise ship emits daily pollution equal to a <em>million</em> cars. A passenger\u2019s carbon footprint triples in size when taking a cruise. The Royal College of Physicians <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39129270\">estimates</a> that the premature deaths of about 40,000 Britons every year are linked to air pollution, with the cruise and shipping industry being <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/air-pollution-uk-shipping-levels-record-environment-fumes-damage-nitrogen-dioxide-sulphur-a8189691.html\">major contributors</a>.</p> <p>Then, there\u2019s the fact that cruises expel enormous quantities of hideous discharge into the ocean. Cruises are <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnival-cruise-ships-dumped-sewage-waste-into-ocean-report-2019-4\">notorious</a> for covering up the fact that they illegally dump sewage, garbage and sulfurous fuel waste \u2013 sometimes even <a href=\"https://www.stand.earth/latest/markets-vs-climate/carnivals-cruise-pollution/46000-people-ask-national-park-service-suspend\">in the protected waters of national parks</a>. Carnival Corp\u2019s environmental violations <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/06/04/729622653/carnival-cruise-lines-hit-with-20-million-penalty-for-environmental-crimes\">date back to 1993</a> and they <em><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article239089503.html\">still</a></em><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article239089503.html\"> haven\u2019t cleaned up</a> their act.</p> <p>Then again, why would they? Even massive fines \u2013 such as the $40m US Carnival was charged in 2016 for <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article118245433.html\">illegally dumping oily water off the coast of England and trying to cover up the crime</a> \u2013 hardly matter when some cruise companies earn revenues of almost <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/carnival-corporation--plc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-record-full-year-earnings-300769295.html\">$19bn</a> annually, essentially tax-free. Cruise companies are able to <a href=\"https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2011/02/articles/taxes/no-taxes-the-cruise-lines-dirty-little-secret/\">exploit a loophole</a> to avoid most US taxes and labor regulations; three major companies make up <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21187076/cruise-line-industry-bailout-trump-coronavirus-us-companies-tax\">70%</a> of the global cruise market, all of which are incorporated in countries with tax and labor laws very different from those of the US.</p> <p>Yes, many people who work on cruises are currently losing their jobs, and that is rightly sad. But bear in mind that the cruise industry\u2019s economic model is built around hiring people from poor countries whose economic prospects are so bad they are willing to endure exploitation and mistreatment. Despite the industry\u2019s massive profits, cruises pay employees as little as <a href=\"https://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=261\">$600 a month</a>.</p> <p>Additionally, cruises further the misguided notion that vacationers should be entitled to travel anywhere, no matter how culturally and ecologically sensitive. Case in point: as sea ice dwindles, the Arctic has emerged as a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/the-best-arctic-and-antarctic-cruises/\">chic destination</a>, allowing cruise passengers to observe the effects of climate change while actively contributing to it.</p> <p>It\u2019s comforting to believe that our vacations benefit local communities \u2013 but that\u2019s not always true, especially in the case of cruise tourism. Residents of Nunavut, Canada, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-complicated-relationship-between-cruise-ships-and-the-arctic-inuit\">have expressed</a> concerns that cruise ships disrupt wildlife and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/04/arctic-cruise-boom-canada-inuit-indigenous-communities\">threaten</a> their culture. Investigations have also found that the sunny economic impact figures provided by the cruise industry may <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/cruise-ships-often-represent-the-worst-of-capitalism/\">overstate the revenue</a> their business actually brings to local communities.</p> <p>When cruise lines are able to sail again, they will do their best to lure customers back with <a href=\"https://www.cruzely.com/will-cruises-get-cheaper-signs-point-to-more-cruise-deals/\">cheaper prices</a>. Hopefully, the debacle of the cruise industry\u2019s botched pandemic response has shown consumers what industry watchdogs have known for decades: the cruise industry is an ethical disaster that shirks accountability at every turn. It is not worth keeping afloat.</p> <ul> <li><p>Adrienne Matei is a journalist who writes about technology and culture</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In 1941, Britain considered its colony of Singapore to be pretty much impregnable. But while the naval base was bristling with big guns, its defences were geared towards preventing a sea-based invasion and when the attack came it was on land, down the Malay peninsula. Britain was expecting trouble, just not from that direction.</p> \n<p>The same fate has befallen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/imf\">International Monetary Fund</a> and the Office for Budget Responsibility, both of which have been forced to rip up their forecasts as a result of Covid-19.

Nor had they any experience of a recession arriving with such sudden ferocity. A look back at past slumps shows that it normally takes 18 months to two years for output to fall from peak to trough. This time, both the International Monetary Find (IMF) and the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) think the UK is already experiencing the worst of the slump and that, following a swift collapse, recovery will begin in the second half of 2020.</p> \n<p>But there are significant differences between the IMF and the OBR assessments. The Washington-based IMF thinks the UK will contract by 6.5% this year; the OBR \u2013 using more timely data \u2013 thinks the figure will be double that.</p> \n<p>The OBR is assuming that each month of lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/rishi-sunak-deeply-troubled-by-obr-warning-of-35-fall-in-uk-gdp\">costs the economy 35% in lost output</a>, knocking 3% off annual GDP for each month. After three months in full quarantine \u2013 during which the economy would shrink by 9% \u2013 the lifting of the restrictions would halve the output lost each month to around 1.5%. By the end of the fourth quarter, output would be back to its pre-Covid crisis levels but the size of the economy would be down 13% year on year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The IMF is more cautious, and is pencilling in a more gradual recovery not just for the UK but for the global economy as a whole. </p> \n<p>It remains to be seen how gradual the process proves to be, and whether it is interrupted by a recurrence of the Covid-19 virus. The IMF is encouraged by the evidence that the lockdowns are helping contain the virus and thinks the extraordinary policy response from central banks will help limit the number of firms going bust and job losses.</p> \n<p>But it has sketched alternatives to its baseline forecast, which take into account extended lockdowns and a second outbreak.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>This would mean a deepened and prolonged downturn running well into next year.

  "<p>Joe Biden has a problem: the young people who fueled Bernie Sanders\u2019 second-place campaign are not very interested in Joe Biden. Biden has a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-consolidates-support-trails-badly-enthusiasm-poll/story?id=69812092\">well-known enthusiasm gap</a> and even though he has dominated recent primary states, younger voters tended to prefer Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.

Well, one reason is that he has <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/03/democrats-you-really-do-not-want-to-nominate-joe-biden\">spent a lifetime</a> opposing key progressive goals, and used to be proud of his reputation as one of the Senate\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/3/9/1925832/-Biden-boasted-of-being-One-of-the-Senate-s-Most-Conservative-Democrats-with-straw-poll\">most conservative</a>\u201d Democrats.

Even today, Biden says he has \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-millennials-dont-have-it-tough-780348\">no empathy</a>\u201d for young people who complain about indebtedness and precarity. He has told millennials who raise concerns about his environmental policies that they should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3dqR9oQ9pE\">go vote for someone else</a>\u201d. Plenty have been willing to do just that. So while some commentators, such as Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias, have <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TmHFt13osiQ\">suggested</a> that activists and left media are responsible for Biden\u2019s \u201cunity problem\u201d, the more blameworthy culprit is Biden himself.</p> <p>In fact, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Biden has much interest in solving his \u201cunity problem\u201d. In an ostensible effort to reach out to the left, Biden recently <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/4/10/headlines/joe_biden_calls_for_medicare_eligibility_age_to_be_lowered_from_65_to_60\">debuted new policies</a> on healthcare and education. Did he adopt the policies recommended in the activists\u2019 letter, namely Medicare for All and canceling all outstanding student debt? <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322\">No, he did not</a>. Instead, he merely proposed lowering the existing Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and canceling tuition-related debt for students who attended public colleges who earn under a certain income.</p> <p>The first of these policies almost seems like a deliberate insult. Biden\u2019s response to those young people demanding a better health policy is to offer a policy that won\u2019t help any of them for decades. And to understand just how pitifully stingy this \u201cconcession\u201d is, remember that dozens of Democratic senators, including plenty of \u201cmoderates\u201d, have <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article211824324.html\">already</a> endorsed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55. You can find an op-ed in Forbes (not exactly the Democratic Socialists of America newsletter) <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/04/10/now-more-than-ever-is-time-to-lower-medicares-age-to-50/#6d26b0ee52be\">suggesting</a> 50 would be a better age. Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/us/clinton-proposes-opening-medicare-to-those-55-to-65.html\">proposed 55</a> in 1998, and Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2016/07/12/clinton-health-care-plan\">advocated 55</a> in 2016. So Biden\u2019s big concession to the left is actually more conservative than a centrist Democratic proposal! It\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s about as close to nothing as a policy can get without literally being nothing, and it shows that Biden isn\u2019t serious about courting the left.</p> <p>Remember, too, that we\u2019re only talking about the <em>platform. </em>This is where negotiations <em>start. </em>By the time a proposal has gone through the political process, it inevitably gets watered down. Maybe, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll get the Medicare age dropped from 65 to 63 by the year 2030 or something. And even that prospect assumes that Biden is serious about fighting for his platform. At election time, politicians have an unfortunate habit of promising voters whatever they think voters want to hear. Needless to say, they don\u2019t always follow through, and you\u2019re often better off looking at their record than their rhetoric. From Biden\u2019s record, it\u2019s more plausible that he\u2019ll follow through on his <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/09/all-you-need-know-biden-reportedly-weighing-billionaires-michael-bloomberg-and-jamie\">reported plan</a> to put Michael Bloomberg and JPMorgan\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, in his cabinet than that he\u2019ll overhaul the healthcare system.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The student debt plan is a disappointment, too. Why only public colleges, when so much unsustainable debt comes from private universities? Why only tuition-related expenses? Why is it means-tested? If Biden wants to impress the left, he will need a big, sweeping plan, not a plan with dozens of qualifiers and caveats that recalls Kamala Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-student-debt-proposal-confused-people-2019-7\">infamous proposal</a> to forgive debt only for \u201cPell grant recipients who start a business that operates for three years in disadvantaged communities\u201d.</p> <p>I actually really hope Biden embraces one of the big left policy proposals such as Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, because he can\u2019t afford to write off progressive votes, and the stakes of this election are high. If Donald Trump is re-elected, it will be a disaster: he will be emboldened and more powerful, and will end his second term with almost complete control of the courts. Democracy as we know it may disappear altogether; US militarism will escalate; carbon emissions will spiral out of control; and brutal new immigration policies will be introduced. Trump needs to lose, but Biden is <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/01/a-biden-nomination-means-a-second-trump-term\">already a weak candidate</a>, and he will be even weaker if he can\u2019t turn out the progressive base.</p> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden. He has shown contempt for them and betrayed many of the causes they care about. To make matters worse, Tara Reade\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/04/evaluating-tara-reades-claims\">credible</a> sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html\">allegation</a> against Biden will make it difficult for those who consider themselves allies of women and supporters of #MeToo to vote for him in good conscience. Biden has a long way to go to convince the left he\u2019s worth supporting.</p> <p>So far, though, it seems as if Biden is mostly concerned with reassuring rich Democratic donors and party bigwigs that he will keep his promise that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/\">nothing would fundamentally change</a>\u201d. That could almost be Biden\u2019s campaign slogan at this point. But it doesn\u2019t seem like a winner. He will need to do better if he\u2019s going to stand a chance of beating Trump.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is the founding editor of Current Affairs.

The time taken for production to be scaled back up means the sharp plunge in output will be followed by only a gradual recovery.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/imf-zip/giv-3902uU8VPq8X70vs/\" data-alt=\"global growth graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/imf-zip/giv-3902uU8VPq8X70vs/\">global growth graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The IMF said its forecasts were highly uncertain and that the risks were that the economic cost of the pandemic would be worse than currently envisaged.

In countries with major outbreaks, the number of new cases has come down, after strong social distancing practices were put in place. The unprecedented pace of work on treatments and vaccines also promises hope. The swift and substantial economic policy actions taken in many countries will help shield people and firms, preventing even more severe economic pain and create the conditions for the recovery.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the effects of the pandemic have been more severe so far in developed countries, the IMF said they were better equipped to cope. It added that many emerging and developing economies faced a multilayered crisis comprising a health shock, domestic disruptions, plummeting external demand, capital flight, and collapsing commodity prices.</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Emma Walmsley, the chief executive of GSK, described the collaboration as \u201cunprecedented\u201d.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cWhat is not common is you\u2019ve got two of the biggest vaccine manufacturers in the world coming together. Both bring significant manufacturing capacity. We believe we\u2019ll be able to make hundreds of millions of doses by the end of next year.\u201d</p> \n<p>Paul Hudson, the chief executive of Sanofi, said: \u201cAs the world faces this unprecedented global health crisis, it is clear that no one company can go it alone. That is why Sanofi is continuing to complement its expertise and resources with our peers, such as GSK, with the goal to create and supply sufficient quantities of vaccines that will help stop this virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanofi, which is headquartered in France, announced in February that it was entering the race to make a vaccine and had secured support from the US health department.</p> \n<p>GSK is already offering access to its technology to smaller teams, such as a vaccine effort at the University of Queensland, but this is the first collaboration that would have the ability to rapidly scale up manufacturing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Two companies joining forces, rather than competing, in a vaccine effort is extremely unusual, but the urgent need for a Covid-19 vaccine and the potential scale of the market is also not a typical situation.</p> \n<p>The vaccine is based on an existing DNA-based technology that Sanofi uses to make its flu vaccine.</p> \n<p>When the coronavirus invades the body, immune cells fight back by producing antibodies. These antibodies bind to specific structures on the foreign invader, called the antigen. In the case of Covid-19 the antigen is a spike-like protein on its exterior.</p> \n<p>Sanofi has synthesised a stretch of DNA that encodes the genetic sequence of that protein. When this DNA is inserted into a harmless bacteria in the lab, it churns out little copies of the antigen \u2013 but not of the active coronavirus itself\u2013 which it hopes will trigger an antibody response, without causing illness.</p> \n<p>GSK is contributing an add-on, known as an adjuvant, that can be mixed in with a vaccine to trigger a stronger immune reaction. This could potentially lower the dose required for each person by a factor of four, significantly increasing the speed at which doses can be produced. The same technology was used in the H1N1 flu pandemic, meaning that both GSK and Sanofi are relying on proven technologies that have been used to manufacture vaccines at large scales.</p> \n<p>Other efforts around the world are further advanced in terms of testing. The US biotech companies Moderna and Inovio both have candidates in phase 1 trials already, but they are using more experimental technologies that would require entirely new manufacturing capabilities to be built. However, even for established vaccine approaches, trials still need to confirm that the selected candidate produces a protective immune response and it is not yet clear whether people will require booster vaccines to maintain immunity.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Walmsley said GSK would not profit from the vaccine during the pandemic and that any revenue would be reinvested in scaling up manufacturing and into research on pandemic preparedness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The companies plan to start phase one trials in the second half of this year and, if successful, say the vaccine could be widely available by the second half of 2021.</p> \n<p>Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is funding the development of eight vaccine candidates, said: \u201cThe combination of Sanofi\u2019s recombinant technology, which will allow the rapid generation and production of vaccine, with GSK\u2019s proven adjuvant technology, which will allow more doses to be generated from a given production volume, will speed the delivery of vaccines to the world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charlie Weller, the head of vaccines at the Wellcome Trust, said the collaboration was unprecedented, adding: \u201cNever before have we needed to produce a vaccine at this speed and scale, so exploring multiple approaches is essential.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>From Skype interviews to online game-based assessments, the way that companies recruit is changing fast. School-leavers and graduates need to keep up \u2013 but it can be difficult to know just what\u2019s required of you when you start applying for your first job. That\u2019s where PwC\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/careers/student-jobs/employability.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Employability Hub</a> comes in. It\u2019s an online, accessible to all, one-stop shop for employability skills and careers advice, designed to give those in the early stages of their career the skills they need to tackle every stage of the application process.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to make employability upskilling available to all,\u201d says Louise Farrar, PwC\u2019s director of student recruitment. \u201cThe hub is designed to educate not just those applying for jobs but also their parents and school career advisers. It shows you what this new world looks like, how you can prepare for it, and the tools you need to navigate it. Employers are moving away from traditional techniques like face-to-face interviews. They\u2019re using new technologies that do the job much better.\u201d</p> <p>If you\u2019re just starting out, you won\u2019t necessarily have the technical skills to do a job, says Farrar: it\u2019s all about showing employers that you have potential. \u201cEmployers will want to see that you can demonstrate the right behaviours and soft skills, such as effective communication, teamwork and managing relationships. Any work experience is good experience \u2013 I was a waitress and a packer. That taught me a lot about the world of work, and what I did and didn\u2019t want to do for the rest of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing how to tell your personal, authentic story is crucial, says Farrar: you might not have a string of glowing extracurricular achievements, but you may have experienced adversity, or particular challenges. \u201cThat might have made you resilient and given you good ways to cope in particularly difficult situations. And they\u2019re also looking for people who are inclusive, who are passionate about what they do, and have fun doing it.\u201d</p> <p>The hub uses a range of digital learning tools to give users that insight, enabling them to prepare and provide examples of where they\u2019ve succeeded or shown particular skills. There are podcasts on technology trends, plus e-learning tutorials on creating a good application, how to succeed at video interviews, and preparing for online assessment tests. And you\u2019ll also find guides to soft skills such as engaging with employers and communicating effectively.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8757bc3ac5aee8d9632cc44dd582769a68aa24f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8757bc3ac5aee8d9632cc44dd582769a68aa24f7/55_0_1437_1437/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Helen Hopkin, PwC\u2019s head of workforce strategy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Hopkin, PwC\u2019s head of workforce strategy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PwC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The career matching tool aims to help users find the best possible opportunity, whatever career you want to pursue. The hub is for everyone, not just those wanting a career with PwC, Farrar emphasises, and choosing a career is about more than just the paycheck. \u201cIt gets you thinking about what your work preferences are and what kind of person you are,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, do you want to do a professional qualification? Do you want to travel a lot? Are you keen to be in a big office? All those sorts of things help you think about what you might want to focus on when it comes to career opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>And some of those tools \u2013 such as the video interview \u2013 are the ones actually used in PwC assessments, helping to demystify the process and make it more accessible. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to trip anyone up!\u201d says Farrar. \u201cRather, we want to equip people to be the best they can possibly be and feel confident in that interview situation. Doing a video interview can be quite a daunting process, particularly if it\u2019s your first time. So you\u2019ll find lots of helpful hints and tips, opportunities to play back your answers and get some general feedback.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hoped that projects like the hub will reach as wide an audience as possible: it\u2019s tailormade for a generation of digital natives. And while its primary purpose is to help prospective candidates prepare, finding the best person for the job is a two-way process. Employers also need to understand what candidates want from a workplace, and what skills they need to focus on. PwC now has a strategic workforce planning capability to enable the firm to do regular scenario planning. \u201cThis provides sophisticated insights into the types of skills in demand over the short and medium term, and allows us to take some educated leaps of faith as to what skills are needed in the future,\u201d says Helen Hopkin, PwC\u2019s head of workforce strategy.</p> <p>\u201cThe world\u2019s demographics continue to shift \u2013 millennials will make up 75% of the global workforce by 2025. We have already seen a shift in how we do things to appeal to those who want something different from the workplace. We need to make sure this continues to evolve as we work together to understand what that needs to look like. We can never stand still; this is a process of constant learning, changing and adapting,\u201d she adds.</p>",
  "<p>Splits in the cabinet emerged at the weekend: according to rumour, the chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/rishi-sunak-dilemma-over-how-to-pay-for-his-coronavirus-spending\">Rishi Sunak</a>, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, were in favour of a shorter lockdown to avert the worst of the economic consequences, while Michael Gove and the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-government-policy-herd-immunity-community-surveillance-covid-19\">Matt Hancock</a>, wanted a longer one, to limit fatalities.</p> <p>The lockdown has taken on recognisable political contours: the fundamentalists on one side, putting the markets first, the moderates on the other, prioritising humans.

The right wants to get back to business as usual; the left wants a lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/raab-suggests-uk-lockdown-could-last-at-least-another-month\">for as long as it takes</a>.</p> <p>That is the wrong way to approach these decisions, which will entail constant and painful trade-offs. Conceptually, we find it easiest to focus on the things we can count. So we talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">stock markets</a>, about businesses going bust and about unemployment as a cost to the exchequer \u2013 and the imperative to lift the lockdown thus becomes a purely economic one. And on the other hand, we talk about numbers infected, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-scraps-plans-to-buy-thousands-of-bluesky-ventilators-coronavirus\">numbers of ventilators</a>, numbers of dead. Yet behind all these numbers, there are people, whose physical and mental health are symbiotic: people to whose wellbeing the virus is not the only threat.</p> <p>Even while recessions are not historically associated with higher mortality, our recent experience of fiscal contraction and austerity was of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\">huge numbers of excess deaths</a>. There are impacts that aren\u2019t yet visible but which we nevertheless cannot ignore; Anne Case, co-author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/us-healthcare-industry-working-class-deaths\">Deaths </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/us-healthcare-industry-working-class-deaths\">of Despair and the Future of Capitalism</a>, pointed out recently that the negative effects of unemployment won\u2019t show up <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/magazine/coronavirus-economy-debate.html\">for perhaps five years</a> but have to be part of our consideration, even while this provides no obvious, definitive course of action.</p> <p>Likewise, isolation has its own health impact. People who were already suffering serious mental illness, or were already housebound with disabilities, have seen many of their support networks capsize overnight, which will create its own tragedies. People living in overcrowded conditions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-park-closures-hit-bame-and-poor-londoners-most\">without green space</a>, will have a potentially devastating experience of self-isolation.</p> <p>You can\u2019t even generalise across the category of \u201cchildhood\u201d \u2013 an affluent kid in year 7 is just having a really long Easter holiday. A kid in year 11, ready for GCSEs, relying on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/09/uks-poorest-families-suffering-as-free-school-meal-vouchers-delayed\">free school meals</a>, is facing something much starker. We were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2020/apr/11/priti-patel-announces-help-for-domestic-abuse-victims-during-lockdown-video\">encouraged by Patel</a> at the weekend to think of those living in abusive relationships, and perhaps stick a supportive logo, declaring \u201cyou are not alone\u201d, in our windows. Our sympathetic thoughts are insufficient to the point of insult; we need to think seriously about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/14/fiona-dwyer-2m-for-coronavirus-domestic-abuse-victims-its-pitiful\">hidden hardship</a> this confinement entails, and it is humane to do so, not the act of some hard-boiled bread-head.</p> <p>None of this is an argument against the lockdown, or even for a shorter period of constraint. It is not at all clear when any of the restrictions could be lifted, or in which order. It is a fruitless discussion to have before we have greater clarity on testing, greater confidence that the antibody tests will work.</p> <p>Rather, it\u2019s a plea for the subtlety and complexity of the question to be reflected in the way it is discussed. If we allow this to calcify into a debate between right and left, the plurality of views collapses into two as we all line up behind our team. Expertise is so often characterised by uncertainty, knowing enough to know that every decision contains pros and cons, consequences both foreseeable and not. Binary debates invite absolute views, and chase away the frustrating complexities of knowledge, in favour of arguments that can obliterate one another. It actually isn\u2019t fair \u2013 and I never thought I\u2019d feel so sympathetic to them \u2013 on the politicians of any party, to turn decisions so seismic into questions of loyalty to a pre-existing agenda.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there are many questions that plainly are political, which we\u2019re asked by the government not to politicise. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/protective-equipment-nhs-staff-coronavirus-frontline-shortages\">provision of protective equipment</a> to NHS and social care staff is not the unknowable conundrum that the health secretary pretends it is, with his intimations that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/11/matt-hancock-reveals-deaths-of-19-nhs-workers-amid-ppe-row\">staff are misusing it</a>, and his airy talk of targets hoped for rather than targets met. There is an obvious duty on the state, if it\u2019s asking people to risk their lives, to protect those people to the very limits of its ability.</p> <p>Likewise, the testing of NHS staff, of care workers, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-london-mayor-devastated-deaths-bus-workers\">bus drivers</a>, of prison officers, of the wider population, this is all a matter for public debate. It is legitimate to interrogate policy every step of the way, and reasonable to point out hypocrisy or incompetence. It would be derelict not to scrutinise decisions around sick pay and other entitlements, income protection for those in insecure work. In the grim daily death toll, it is right to ask how the tragedy is being distributed, what can be done to address the disproportionate risk faced by those in low-paid work, why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\">black and minority ethnic people</a> comprise such a high number of the total, how to narrow these health inequalities in real time. A nation may come together in the face of an emergency, but it doesn\u2019t need to switch its brain off.</p> <p>Yet the way forward, murky and obscure, is made no clearer by partisanship. If we build the strategy of the next phase well, it will be short on fireworks. There will be no grandstanding or rabble-rousing; it will be hard to tell who\u2019s on which team; there will be a large variety of expert voices, making points subtle enough that to hear the differences between them, we\u2019ll have to listen; it will be conducted in pastels not neon. The pandemic appears to distill politics down to its barest essentials: do you care about money, or do you care about people? The only problem is, it doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>Open flames burning in Chernobyl\u2019s exclusion zone have been extinguished after rain fell in the region north of Kyiv early on Tuesday morning, Ukraine\u2019s emergency service has said, although activists monitoring the wildfires complained they had been barred from entering the area.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no open flames,\u201d the state emergency service said in a statement on Tuesday morning.

On Monday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pledged to be transparent about the progress of the fires. \u201cThe public must know the truth and be safe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Yemelianenko, who is also a member of public advisory board to the emergency service, posted a video on Monday showing flames and a cloud of smoke rising within sight of the protective shelter over the carcass of Chernobyl\u2019s Unit 4 nuclear reactor, the site of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/16/chernobyl-was-even-worse-than-tv-series-kim-willsher\">worst nuclear disaster in history</a>.</p> <p>Yemelianenko then wrote that the fire had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat and was just 2km (1.24 miles) away from the nuclear power plant and the Pidlisny radioactive waste disposal site.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is critical. The zone is burning,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post accompanied by a video of the blaze. Yemelianenko accused the government of covering up the severity of the fires.</p> <p>Reuters also reported on Monday that Greenpeace believed the fire was considerably larger than official estimates.</p> <p>On Monday, Ukraine\u2019s emergency service said the fire was \u201cdifficult\u201d but called for calm, saying all radiation levels in Kyiv were normal and urging people not to listen to \u201capocalyptic messages\u201d.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/next\">Next</a> reopened its website on Tuesday, only to shut it again less than two hours later after meeting its daily order target.</p> \n<p>The clothing retailer resumed its online operations at 7am on Tuesday, almost three weeks after pulling the plug because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/next-stops-online-shopping-amid-uk-coronavirus-restrictions\">because of concerns about the safety of staff</a> in its warehouses during the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n<p>Next began taking orders for children\u2019s clothing and small homewares after putting extra safety measures in place, including cleaning kits and staff tabards marked on the back with the message \u201cstay 2 metres apart\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the company rapidly closed its website until Wednesday as it said it had met its daily order limit, reflecting the reduced capacity at its sites.

  "<p>\u201cDomestic abuse and coercive control steals people\u2019s language away from them,\u201d says Jess Hill. She has spent the past six years of her life trying to give it back.</p> <p>Hill has won two Walkleys, an Amnesty International award and three Our Watch awards for her reporting on domestic violence. Now, she can add the Stella prize to that list.</p> <p>The journalist\u2019s 2019 book, See What You Made Me Do, was announced the winner of the $50,000 prize for Australian women\u2019s writing on Tuesday night. The book is the product of a four-year investigation into domestic abuse with the lens turned firmly on perpetrators. In it Hill asks: why do abusive men make the choices they do, and what systems of power enable them?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/09/stella-prize-2020-a-readers-guide-to-the-shortlist-from-jess-hill-to-charlotte-wood\">Stella prize 2020: a reader's guide to the shortlist from Jess Hill to Charlotte Wood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a book that Louise Swinn, chair of the judging panel, called an \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d work that \u201cmeticulously dismantle[s] all of the lazy old lies we associate with domestic abuse\u201d.</p> <p>It is an immense project, but Hill\u2019s objectives for the book were initially much more tightly focused.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted people to understand what victim-survivors had been through and why they\u2019d made the choices that they\u2019d made,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI especially wanted people to understand what many victim-survivors go through in the family law system. That was my initial frame: I want to get a visceral feeling across to regular people about what it feels and looks like to go through domestic abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Not long into that process, Hill realised she needed to turn the spotlight on to the perpetrators instead. Why did these men choose to act this way? That reorientation threw up all kinds of complications.</p> <p>\u201cThat was just such a deep rabbit hole. Personally, it was very difficult to contain,\u201d she says. \u201cI was actually having to excavate so many things that I believed \u2013 so many biases and stereotypes \u2013 but also really having to contend with a lot of anger about what these guys do.\u201d</p> <p>Swinn said See What You Made Me Do \u201cdoes much more than draw attention to this crisis \u2013 it offers solutions for reform\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe statistics are utterly horrifying, and Hill\u2019s extraordinary call to action cannot be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside Hill in the shortlist for the Stella were 2016 winner Charlotte Wood for her novel The Weekend; Tara June Winch\u2019s novel The Yield; There Was Still Love by Favel Parrett; Caro Llewellyn\u2019s memoir Diving Into Glass; and Josephine Rowe\u2019s collection of short stories, Here Until August.</p> <p>While the main prize of $50,000 is generous, the other authors in the running will not come away empty-handed. Each shortlisted author receives $2,000 and a three-week writing retreat in Point Addis on the Victorian coast, in addition to the $1,000 they received for being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/07/does-writing-books-still-matter-in-an-era-of-environmental-catastrophe\">longlisted</a>.</p> <p>Hill says the proceeds from winning the Stella will go some way towards recouping what she invested in the writing of her book, especially after the project snowballed.</p> <p>\u201cI thought the book would only take six months to write. That\u2019s all we could afford,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd [by then] the book was just not anywhere close to what I wanted it to be. We thought, well, we just have to see this out until it\u2019s finished. And that cost us so much.\u201d</p> <p>Foremost in Hill\u2019s mind while writing the book were the victim-survivors she had met, whose stories she told, and who she became very close to during the process of writing about their lives. She says she hopes the book\u2019s Stella success will help it reach a wider audience.</p> <p>\u201cIf more people can understand this, we\u2019re going to have a better functioning society. It\u2019s just not good enough to me that there are millions of people who are alive right now who have lived through domestic abuse, who are not understood by the rest of Australia,\u201d she says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email\">Saved for Later: sign-up for Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle email</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEven if it just went out to people who\u2019ve lived through this type of abuse, you\u2019re talking about 2 million women who\u2019ve lived through intimate-partner violence, millions of grown-up children. So the numbers on that scale are enormous. But I also want this to talk to every psychiatrist, every police officer, every psychologist, every judge.\u201d</p> <p>The 2020 Stella awards ceremony was livestreamed on the Guardian and featured an address from former prime minister Julia Gillard. It was a virtual event thanks to emergency social distancing measures due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In the wake of calls from victims\u2019 advocacy groups to better support domestic violence services during the Covid-19 crisis, Hill says she believes we need to be \u201cmore creative\u201d in how we get women in contact with services.</p> <p>She mentions by way of example a scheme in France in which women could use a code word at a pharmacy that would trigger a response from domestic violence services. \u201cThere\u2019s no one solution that would make it safe for women to get in contact with services.\u201d</p> <p>Leaving an abusive relationship may seem extra daunting in the midst of a global crisis, she says.

Clearly he felt wounded by the weekend\u2019s big New York Times story, which portrayed a president fumbling through January and February without a pandemic plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/trump-coronavirus-meltdown-media-authority\">writes David Smith</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Donald Trump, starved of campaign rallies, Mar-a-Lago weekends and golf, and goaded by a bombshell newspaper report, couldn\u2019t take it any more.

  "<p>When Nish Kumar\u2019s political comedy show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b08yxh4h/the-mash-report\">The Mash Report</a> returned to our TV screens earlier this month, things looked very different to the last series \u2013 and not just because he\u2019d accidentally shaved his beard off. With the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown in place, Kumar hosted the show from his spare room, forcing him to grapple with a professional camera and lighting on his own.</p> <p>Writing the show had been challenging, too. He knew that viewers who were isolated from loved ones needed a laugh. But making jokes while respecting the gravity of the situation is a tricky balancing act. In the end, Kumar decided to not to hold back: \u201cThis whole situation is a weird combination of boring and terrifying, like an epidemiology lecture delivered by Freddy Krueger \u2013 or Dominic Raab being, well, Dominic Raab,\u201d he announced. Meanwhile, co-star Rachel Parris tackled self-appointed coronavirus experts, including \u201ctesticle with teeth\u201d, JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4acbce870f7a81219ce190299e27ac0e4a808c6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4acbce870f7a81219ce190299e27ac0e4a808c6d/0_1218_4912_6142/800.jpg\" alt=\"Doesn\u2019t shy away from tough topics \u2026 Rachel Parris.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doesn\u2019t shy away from difficult material \u2026 Rachel Parris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Mash Report \u2013 and Kumar and Parris\u2019s segments in particular \u2013 has never shied away from tough topics. In past series, Kumar has taken on the rise of the far right, Conservative immigration policies and climate change, somehow making them all funny.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s obviously not providing people with a full escape,\u201d he says. \u201cThe last few years have been very frenetic. We\u2019ve tried to take those news stories and make them into something that is entertaining, funny and gives people some catharsis, but also doesn\u2019t denigrate the seriousness of the issues.\u201d</p> <p>Kumar has been creating political comedy for around a decade. During that time, multiple Conservative governments, Brexit and Trump have provided fuel for his best material, causing his profile to rise as he became host of the BBC\u2019s topical radio comedy Newsjack, before taking the lead on The Mash Report.</p> <p>His personal politics are on the left: \u201cI\u2019d hoped, after the financial crisis in 2008, that we would look at the systemic failures that had allowed the crash to happen and rebalance our economy. I\u2019m sad that anger has been directed towards groups of people who are entirely blameless \u2013 people on benefits, people from minority groups. These are not the enemies.\u201d</p> <p>That sense of injustice fuels Kumar\u2019s best work, when, as he puts it, \u201cyou believe in the idea that you\u2019re writing the joke about.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s clearly easier, then, to write impassioned comedy when objectionable politicians and policies provide your punchlines: Nigel Farage\u2019s xenophobia, Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment, Donald Trump\u2019s everything. If things were different \u2013 a socialist government, fully funded public services, impeccable leaders \u2013 would the material dry up?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Prior to 2016, you had to convince people that politics was something they wanted to hear about</p> <footer> <cite>Nish Kumar</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI would much rather work a bit harder,\u201d Kumar laughs. \u201cI would rather be writing jokes in a less volatile political climate, still committed to ideals, but without the world burning.

That comes through strongly in her standup. It\u2019s there in Newsjack, too, but across the show, which has other writers and receives submissions from the public, there\u2019s a drive to satirise each end of the political spectrum. \u201cIt\u2019s not a party political broadcast for anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a big journey for me \u2013 you can\u2019t just say: \u2018These are the bad guys\u2019. We\u2019ve got do better than that. A level of analysis goes into stuff that you might not appreciate when you hear that sketch about a dolphin or whatever. It\u2019s a really hard balance to strike, but it\u2019s also part of making a good show.\u201d</p> <p>Over on The Mash Report, Kumar has freedom to broadcast his opinions. \u201cWe wanted to do something that had a point of view. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re there to campaign for one party, but you\u2019re definitely there to represent a set of principles you believe in.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6sPEoBd8vQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J6sPEoBd8vQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Nevertheless, he wouldn\u2019t shy away from making others on the left the subject of his jokes. \u201cThere always needs to be accountability, regardless of who\u2019s in government,\u201d Kumar says. \u201cI would almost think you\u2019d want to do that more to people you agree with, because you want to push them to achieve the ideals you share.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When you\u2019re passionate about something, it makes it easier to write comedy about it</p> <footer> <cite>Tom Mayhew</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Kumar and Pritchard-McLean, standup comedian <a href=\"https://www.tommayhew.co.uk/about-me\">Tom Mayhew</a> hasn\u2019t yet had the chance to make comedy under a government he agrees with, but his work has been fuelled by this opposition. His 2019 Edinburgh show I, Tom Mayhew was a takedown of austerity, based on his own experience of the benefits system and the way claimants are treated. His next show looks at so-called low-skilled jobs \u2013 how they\u2019re integral to our society (as proven by the current crisis) and bring joy and worth to many workers, despite the fact they\u2019re not well-paid.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re passionate about something, it makes it easier to write comedy about it,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it\u2019s tough, you\u2019ll find a way to write something funny because you want to express these thoughts and feelings.\u201d</p> <p>If we did end up in a socialist utopia, Mayhew admits that his onstage persona would become cheerier. \u201cBut even if the political landscape changed there will always be people to be held accountable, and there\u2019ll always be perceptions that will need challenging.\u201d</p> <p>Like Kumar\u2019s material about climate change or Pritchard-McLean on misogyny, Mayhew\u2019s comedy doesn\u2019t shy away from heavy topics. Yet he\u2019s conscious that audiences don\u2019t want to be preached to. \u201cI want my comedy to be funny first, but meaningful a close second,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if it doesn\u2019t change people\u2019s minds, they\u2019ll hopefully be a bit more understanding of a viewpoint that isn\u2019t theirs.

It is only by working together that we can succeed. It is often true that the biggest challenges create the biggest opportunities and it is no different for rugby. We must help each other through these tough times.</p> <p>\u201cWe need World Rugby, as our international federation, to be fit for purpose and seen as world leading. We need to define our purpose and mission and what kind of organisation we want in order to lead us into the future. Only then can we decide what the strategic objectives are.</p> <p>\u201cFor rugby to thrive we need it to grow into a global sport and move beyond its traditional territories. We need a coherent and meaningful global calendar that supports those at the top of the game and develops those aspiring to be there. We also need to make our sport more attractive to everyone who plays and watches as well as the broadcasters.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/12/rugby-union-coronavirus-cash-uncertainty-players-future\">Covid-19 has turned players' lives upside down but rugby was already fragile | Will Hooley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beaumont, who is campaigning for women to be represented at every level of decision-making in the game, was behind World Rugby\u2019s plan for a nations championship that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\" title=\"\">foundered last year</a> because it failed to attract the support of all of the Six Nations.

  "<h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/peter-may/lockdown/9781529411683/\">Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>Peter May<br><em>Riverrun, \u00a38.99, pp416</em></p> <p>Writers everywhere may be setting out to chronicle the outbreak of a global pandemic, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/08/best-recent-thrillers-reviews-roundup\">Peter May</a>, it turns out, has already done it. In 2005, he wrote a crime novel set against the backdrop of a bird flu pandemic. London is in complete lockdown; a hospital is being erected in the grounds of Lambeth Palace when the bones of a child are found in a suitcase and detective Jack MacNeil is told to investigate. The book was never published because \u201cBritish editors at the time thought my portrayal of London under siege by the invisible enemy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/bird-flu\">H5N1</a> was unrealistic and could never happen\u201d, writes May in a foreword to <em>Lockdown</em> , which is just out in ebook, with a paperback to follow.</p> <p>This thriller would be eerie right now anyway, but it\u2019s even eerier given that May wrote it 15 years ago. His virus is far deadlier than Covid-19, but his portrait of a city under siege from a silent enemy, his explanations for the spread of the disease \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019ve created the perfect incubators for breeding and passing on infection, in the buses and planes and underground trains we travel on. We were a human disaster waiting to happen\u201d \u2013 are scarily prescient. May, who is currently \u201chunkered down at home in France, forbidden to leave my house except in exceptional circumstances\u201d, as he writes in a new foreword to the book, is a classy crime writer and <em>Lockdown</em> is both prophetic and unnerving.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/little-disasters-9781471165030.html\">Little Disasters</a></strong></h2> <p>Sarah Vaughan<br><em>Simon &amp; Schuster, \u00a314.99, pp432</em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sarahvaughanauthor.com/\">Sarah Vaughan</a>, who hit the bestseller lists with <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/14/anatomy-of-a-scandal-sarah-vaughan-review\">Anatomy of a Scandal</a></em>, is back with her fourth novel, the shocking, impossible-to-look-away <em>Little Disasters</em>. Opening as a mother becomes increasingly desperate in her attempts to quieten her screaming baby \u2013 \u201cdoesn\u2019t it make sense to hold her tight, to please, to bargain, perhaps to shout? To try to shake a little sense into her?\u201d \u2013 it follows a paediatric doctor, Liz, as she deals with the fallout when her friend Jess brings her baby, Betsey, into A&amp;E. Jess says Betsey \u201cisn\u2019t herself\u201d; Liz discovers Betsey actually has a fractured skull and that Jess\u2019s story doesn\u2019t really make sense. Tracing the aftermath as Betsey lies sick in hospital, Vaughan moves between perspectives \u2013 the increasingly desperate Jess; Liz, dealing with issues this raises from her own past; and Jess\u2019s husband, Ed, racked with guilt for letting the burden of family life fall upon his wife.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-split-9781409174196.html\">The Split</a></strong></h2> <p>Sharon Bolton<br><em>Trapeze, \u00a312.99, pp400</em></p> <p>The island of South Georgia, between the Antarctic and the Falkland Islands, is one of the most remote places on Earth, home only to a British Antarctic Survey station and visited occasionally by tourist boats. That\u2019s why Felicity, in Sharon Bolton\u2019s <em>The Split</em>, has chosen it \u2013 she\u2019s hiding from someone (fortunately, she happens to be a glaciologist). \u201cThe ends of the Earth. That\u2019s how far she ran this time. Not far enough.\u201d Because Freddie Lloyd, who has been in prison for murder, is on the last tourist boat out to the island and Felicity is running out of places to hide. Bolton\u2019s depiction of this stark, beautiful, remote wilderness is a balm to the soul in these restricted times and her complicated mystery a welcome diversion from reality.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-dead-line-9781526602947/\">The Dead Line</a></strong></h2> <p>Holly Watt<br><em>Raven, \u00a314.99, pp480</em></p> <p>Investigative reporter Casey Benedict first appeared in Holly Watt\u2019s debut <em>To the Lions</em>, which won her the Crime Writers\u2019 Association\u2019s Ian Fleming Steel Dagger. Now she\u2019s back in <em>The Dead Line</em>, which sees her team looking into the discovery of a desperate message sewn into clothes manufactured for the British high street: \u201cThey take the babies for the women.\u201d Her investigation into what this means takes her to Washington DC, to the Greek islands and to Bangladesh, where she learns of the teenage girls who are being abducted from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya\">Rohingya</a> camps. \u201cA flame of energy, grey eyes missing nothing\u201d, Casey is fierce, obsessive and brilliant. Watt, herself an investigative journalist, provides a daunting insight into what the job entails \u2013 \u201cordered to override, day after day, the human instinct to be polite, to not intrude, to avert one\u2019s eyes so civilly\u201d \u2013 as Casey blackmails and tricks her way to the truth.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Little Disasters </em>or<em> The Split</em> for a special price, click on the titles or go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/untold-night-and-day-9781787331600.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a>.

This definition captured a swathe of AP pupils, since 32% of excluded pupils have a social worker, compared with just 5% in mainstream schools.</p> <p>The next day the Department for Education (DfE) issued further <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-vulnerable-children-and-young-people\">guidance</a>, saying schools should remain open to vulnerable children, including those \u201cwith safeguarding and welfare needs\u201d, conceivably every child in alternative provision. By 22 March, updated guidance asked \u201clocal authorities and schools to maintain provision for children in alternative provision settings wherever possible\u201d, with the \u201cexpectation that vulnerable children who have a social worker will attend school\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e85d9417-f04a-4c11-b3b8-61c89754e1f9\"         data-atom-type=\"qanda\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>So the schools are being asked to keep their doors open.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>The global death toll neared 120,000 as cases passed 1.92 million.</strong></h2> <p>According to Johns Hopkins University figures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/global-covid-19-cases-near-2-million-as-putin-warns-russia-faces-extraordinary-crisis\">1,920,985 people worldwide are known to have been infected</a> with coronavirus, though the total number of infections is likely higher. So far, 119,687 people have died in the pandemic.</p> <h2>France restrictions to ease in May</h2> <p>In a televised address, the French president said France would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/macron-france-remain-strict-lockdown-for-another-month\">start returning to normal life on 11 May</a>, if citizens were \u201ccivic, responsible and respected the rules\u201d \u2013 and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop. He said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won.</p> <h2><strong>Brace for \u2018extraordinary\u2019 crisis, says Putin</strong></h2> <p>As Moscow tightened its lockdown measures, Russia reported its highest daily infection figures yet. Russia reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, bringing the overall nationwide tally to 18,328. Eighteen people diagnosed with the virus died overnight, pushing the death toll to 148. In a video conference with officials on Monday, Putin said the next weeks would be \u201cdecisive\u201d for Russia\u2019s fight against the virus as the situation \u201cis changing practically every day, and unfortunately not for the better.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>China cases emerge on Russia border</strong></h2> <p>China reported 89 new coronavirus cases on 13 April, down from 108 the previous day. China\u2019s state broadcaster had reported earlier that 79 of the day\u2019s imported cases were in the northeast province of Heilongjiang, which shares a border with Russia. Hubei province reported 0 new deaths and cases.</p> <h2><strong>Trump threatens to withdraw funding from WHO again</strong></h2> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">bizarre and antagonistic press briefing</a> that included the airing of a campaign-style video attacking the press and Trump announcing his authority over lockdown rules is \u201ctotal\u201d, the US president said he will also decide this week whether he plans to reopen the US by 1 May. Payments to individuals as part of the US economic stimulus package will be made by Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.</p> <h2><strong>Hospitalisations in New York start to plateau</strong></h2> <p>A glimmer of hope. Deaths and hospitalisations are falling in New York. \u201cYes, I think you can say the worst is over,\u201d governor Andrew Cuomo said, announcing an alliance with six other governors in the region to explore how to lift restrictions. \u201cIf you do it wrong, it can backfire, and we\u2019ve seen that with other places in the globe,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> <h2><strong>Japan reports 390 new cases</strong></h2> <p>Monday\u2019s new cases were lower than the 530 new cases reported by the health ministry on Sunday. The country\u2019s total is 7,645. Japan was put under a state of emergency last week, but many people were still seen queuing up at grocery stores and crowding shopping arcades in parts of downtown Tokyo.</p> <h2><strong>IMF to provide immediate debt relief to 25 countries</strong></h2> <p>The debt relief will be made available under the IMF\u2019s Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT). About $215 million of the total will be used for grants to the first 25 countries over the next six months, with extensions possible up to two years. The first countries that will receive debt service relief from the CCRT are Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Togo and Yemen.</p>",
  "<p>The number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak.</p> \n<p>The country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow.

At least 119,678 people around the world have died, with the highest death tolls in the US and Italy. About 450,000 people have recovered.</p> \n<p>The true number of infections is likely to be higher, with suspected underreporting or limited testing in some countries.

  "<p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/04/coronavirus-global-financial-collapse-prevented-podcast\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\" title=\"\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\" title=\"\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. It is not only Europe and the US that have been shut down, but once-booming emerging market economies in Asia. Commodity exporters from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa face collapsing markets.</p> <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. From the street hawkers of Delhi to the personal trainers of LA, the service sector \u2013 by far the most important employer in the modern economy \u2013 has been poleaxed. Never before has the global economy suffered a shock of this scale all at once. In the US alone, at least 17 million people have lost their jobs in the last three weeks. A severe global recession is now inevitable.</p> <p>The crucial question is how much of the world economy will survive the lockdown, and this depends on the availability of credit. Business runs on credit. The bits of the economy that do continue to function \u2013 the warehouses, the mobile phone providers and internet firms \u2013 all need credit. Wage bills for those still working are financed through credit. Even greater is the need of those who are not working. If they can\u2019t get loans, bills will go unpaid, which spreads the pain. To survive the lockdown, millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit, too. Across the world we are witnessing the largest surge in deficits and government debt since the second world war.</p> <p>But who do we borrow from? Banks, financial markets and money markets provide the financial fuel of the world economy. Normally, credit is sustained by the optimistic promise of growth. When that dissolves, you face a self-reinforcing cycle of collapsing confidence, contracting credit, unemployment and bankruptcy, which spreads a poison cloud of pessimism. Like an epidemic, if left uncontrolled, it will sweep all before it, destroying first the financially fragile and then much else besides. It is not for nothing that we speak of financial contagion.</p> <p>What began with the lockdown in Wuhan in January is more intense and more fast-moving than any recession we have seen before. In a matter of weeks we have been confronted with an economic outlook that is as grim as at any moment since the 1930s. But it could have been even worse. Imagine a situation in which, on top of the pain of the lockdown and the hellish scenes in hospital wards, we also face calls for austerity because the government cannot safely finance extra spending. Imagine that interest rates were surging, and the terms for credit cards, car loans and mortgages were suddenly getting stiffer. All of this may still happen. It is already happening to the weaker economies around the world. But for now at least, it has not happened in Europe and the US \u2013 even after the turbulence of March 2020, when the pandemic hit with full force.</p> <p>What Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. Without that, large parts of their economies would not be on life support \u2013 they would be stone dead. And our governments would be struggling with a financial crunch to boot. Maintaining the flow of credit has been the precondition for sustaining the lockdown. It is the precondition for a concerted public health response to the pandemic.</p> <p>During major crises, we are reminded of the fact that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. When financial markets are functioning normally, it remains in the background. But when they threaten to break down, it has the option of stepping forward to act as a lender of last resort. It can make loans, or it can buy assets from banks, funds or other businesses that are desperate for cash. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited. That means it can decide who sinks and who swims. We learned this in 2008. But 2020 has driven home the point as never before.</p> <p>The last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. The results have been momentous. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system. We may never know what went on behind the closed doors of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England during those critical moments in March. So far, only <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/some-ecb-officials-had-doubts-about-emergency-bond-purchases\" title=\"\">muffled sounds of argument</a> have reached the outside. But as the virus struck, the men and women in those three central banks held the economic survival of hundreds of millions of people and the fate of nations in their hands. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The financial markets scan the world for risk. Even the slightest disruption in the vast networks of finance, production and trade offers the opportunity for profit or the threat of loss. So the news on 23 January, that the outbreak of an unknown virus was serious enough for the Chinese authorities to impose a gigantic quarantine, hit the traders on their Bloomberg terminals hard. Bank economists struggled to get a grip on the dimensions of the problem. Would this be a minor disruption like Sars in 2003? Or were we facing the nightmare scenario of the Hollywood film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\" title=\"\">Contagion</a>?</p> <p>In late January, investors began to move more and more money out of things like commodities and shares in companies, and into the relative safety of government bonds. What comforted them was the idea that the virus was a problem contained in China. The day that illusion burst \u2013 the day that investors realised that Covid-19 was becoming a global pandemic \u2013 was Monday 24 February. Over the weekend the Italian government had announced that it was imposing a quarantine in parts of northern Italy. It was the first place in the west to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc/0_0_5312_3541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Serran\u00f2/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, Italy\u2019s economy had been stagnating. Both its banks and its public finances were in a precarious state. Italy\u2019s debt levels were high enough to cause bond markets to periodically panic. Now the country would become the frontline in the virus fight. The coronavirus would test the solidarity of the eurozone at its weakest link.</p> <p>At this point, not everyone was taking the threat seriously. The caseload in the US still looked tiny. Donald Trump dismissed the virus as a \u201cscare\u201d. But investors were now seriously worried. Over the week that began on 24 February, America\u2019s main stock market index, the S&amp;P 500, lost 10% of its value. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, was concerned enough to signal that he would soon be bringing forward a cut in interest rates, in order to stimulate consumption and investment. It was a conventional reaction, but Covid-19 was no longer looking like a conventional threat.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By early March, whatever complacency had prevailed was long gone. The death toll in northern Italy was rising into the hundreds and it was only a matter of time before the government in Rome would be forced to declare a nationwide lockdown.</p> <p>Investors around the world started to panic. In times of uncertainty, they want safe-haven assets. What makes a government bond a safe investment is not only the financial standing of the borrower, but the depth of the market in which lenders can sell them if they want to get their money back sooner. There is no deeper market than that for US Treasuries, as US government bonds are known. The greater the demand for safety, the lower the interest rate the US government generally has to pay to borrow. In the first week of March, those rates were at record lows.</p> <p>For the rest of the world economy, this run to safety was an alarming signal. One sector that knew it was heading for trouble was oil. When the global economy slows, so does the demand for energy. The oil industry of the 21st century consists, on the one hand, of large, state-controlled producers \u2013 above all the Opec group dominated by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 and, on the other hand, of the US\u2019s upstart fracking industry. To match falling demand for oil, the Saudis wanted to cut overall production and thus prop up the price. For this they needed the agreement of the other big producers, but Russia refused to go along with them. As Moscow saw it, cutting production with a view to propping up prices was an invitation to American shale producers to fill the gap. If the politics of climate change meant that the future really would bring a transition away from fossil fuel, winning the end game involved seizing as much of the market as possible for as long as oil was being pumped. So Russia decided not to cut production, but to launch a price war. Not wanting to be outdone, over the weekend of 7-8 March, Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\" title=\"\">took up the challenge</a>. It announced that it would be maximising production and discounting its prices.</p> <p>On Monday 9 March, as markets opened, oil prices plummeted. The benchmark Brent crude fell 24% by the end of trading. By the end of the month its value had halved. From the point of view of the financial markets, the ferocity of the competition in the oil industry was a harbinger of things to come. Falling demand would force industry after industry to either slash prices or contract production. Either way, it was bad news for profits.</p> <p>When trading opened on Wall Street that morning, the situation was so dire that the circuit-breakers \u2013 automatic stops to trading that are triggered when prices fall by a certain amount \u2013 were soon activated. This was supposed to slow a wild selloff. But it sent a message of panic. As soon as trading resumed, everything sold.</p> <p>A rout like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/09/markets-plunge-crash-financial-crisis-coronavirus-ftse-italy-oil-price-dow-business-live?page=with:block-5e663c6f8f085f0b8d944e59\" title=\"\">the one that began on 9 March</a> has a perverse logic. When fund managers face withdrawals from the people whose money they manage, they need cash and have to choose which assets to sell first. They might prefer to sell the riskiest investments, but those can be disposed of only for a large loss. So instead, they attempt to sell their most liquid and safe assets \u2013 government bonds. That means the prices of those bonds fall, dragging them into the maelstrom. This has the knock-on effect of unravelling a basic relationship on which many investors rely: typically, when shares go down, bonds go up, and vice versa. So to protect yourself against risk, you buy a portfolio made up of both. If everything works as it\u2019s supposed to, the swings should balance each other out. But in the panic that began on 9 March, this was no longer happening: rather than balancing out, the price of shares and bonds were collapsing together. The only thing that anyone wanted to hold was cash, and what they wanted most of all were dollars. The surging US dollar in turn spread the pressure worldwide to everyone who owed money in that currency.</p> <p>The Fed had desperately tried to halt the run. To signal its willingness to support the economy and ease the pressure on the world economy from the strong dollar, it had <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/emergency-rate-cuts-events-caused-past-fed-coronavirus-timeline-when-2020-3-1028964493#1-october-2008-lehman-falls1\" title=\"\">brought forward</a> an interest rate cut that had been expected for the middle of the month. But with the darkening horizon, lower interest rates did little to help. Who would borrow or invest under such circumstances? Confidence was broken. Just how badly would become clear over the following two weeks.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It was a cruel twist of fate that Italy was the first European country struck by the virus. Italy has a sophisticated medical system; Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, is among the richest places in the world. The weakness lies in the country\u2019s public finances. To fight the crisis, Italy needed to be spending money on public health and to support the economy during the lockdown. But would the corset of the euro give it the leeway?</p> <p>The problem was that spending to meet the coronavirus crisis would raise Italy\u2019s public debts. The more indebted you are, the higher the price you pay to borrow. For a European government, that premium is measured by the difference, or \u201cspread\u201d, between your interest rate and that paid by Germany, the highest-ranked borrower in Europe. With its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/eu-could-fine-italy-3bn-for-breaking-spending-and-borrowing-rules\" title=\"\">pre-crisis debt</a> at just under 135% of GDP, Italy was perilously close to the point at which rising spreads would drive up its deficit and thus, in a vicious circle, make its debts less and less sustainable.</p> <p>To ensure that investors stay calm, it is the job of central banks to act as the buyer of last resort. But because Italy is a member of the eurozone, it no longer has an independent national central bank that can buy its debt. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is prohibited from directly buying a member country\u2019s newly issued debt. That left the Italians exposed. As the coronavirus crisis intensified in late February and investors became concerned by the prospect of greater state spending, the spread to German interest rates increased. If they rose too far, Italy would face not only a public health disaster but a financial crisis, too. What could Europe do to help?</p> <p>Italy already had reason to feel abandoned by its European partners: they had done little to help it tackle its chronic unemployment problem, or to take in the refugees arriving from north Africa. The coronavirus was a new test. The signs were not good: other member states were grudging in their reaction to Italy\u2019s appeals for help. But what really mattered, for the country\u2019s financial survival, was the stance taken by the ECB.</p> <p>Under its former president, Mario Draghi, the ECB had emerged in the course of the last financial crisis as the pivot of the European economy. Draghi\u2019s promise to do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/eurozone-crisis-greece-bailout-barroso#block-501117ec95cb1d4f92af2233\" title=\"\">whatever it takes</a> to hold the eurozone together, uttered at the height of the crisis in July 2012, has become a mantra of modern economic policy. Faced with a financial panic, restoring confidence is key \u2013 and because a central bank is in charge of issuing currency, it is the only crisis-fighter with truly unlimited firepower.</p> <p>Northern European fiscal and monetary conservatives had always been suspicious of Draghi\u2019s interventions, which they saw as a way to transfer Italy\u2019s liabilities on to Europe\u2019s balance sheet. And his <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy/draghi-ties-lagardes-hands-with-promise-of-indefinite-stimulus-idUKKCN1VW2SR\" title=\"\">final round</a> of bond-buying, in 2019, proved particularly controversial. By the time he ended his stint at the ECB that autumn, it was all Angela Merkel\u2019s government in Berlin could do to ensure that there were no unseemly scenes at his retirement party.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the former finance minister of France and IMF boss, took over as head of the ECB in October 2019, and inherited Draghi\u2019s extraordinarily difficult position. Now she would have to demonstrate that she could handle a major financial crisis. The ECB press conference on 12 March was the crucial test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba/0_0_3500_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ECB had good news for Europe\u2019s banks: they would receive a huge amount of low-cost funding. It was also going to buy an additional \u20ac120bn in assets \u2013 although if that was spread across the members of the Eurozone, as the rules demanded, it would hardly give Italy the support it needed. But the critical moment came when Lagarde was asked a question about the ECB\u2019s attitude to sovereign debt. Her <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-06/coronavirus-lagarde-s-810-billion-u-turn-came-in-just-4-weeks?srnd=premium\" title=\"\">response</a> was remarkable. \u201cWe are not here to close spreads,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the function or the mission of the ECB. There are other tools for that, and there are other actors to actually deal with those issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpreads\u201d meant Italy. And what Lagarde seemed to be saying was that it was somebody else\u2019s problem. But if the ECB wasn\u2019t going to help Italy, who would? Did it really expect the other member states of the eurozone to string together a fiscal safety net for Italy? Obviously, given the bad blood between Italy and the northern Europeans, Lagarde had to walk a fine line. But with hundreds of people dying every day, with global financial markets in a state of repressed panic, was the ECB seriously suggesting that it would wait for Berlin, Paris and Rome to settle their differences before putting out the fire? It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\" title=\"\">breathtaking</a>.</p> <p>For investors, Lagarde\u2019s comment came like a bolt of lightning. And within minutes, she started to backtrack. She went in front of the cameras to promise that the ECB would use the flexibility of its \u20ac120bn programme to prevent the fragmentation of the euro area \u2013 code for helping Italy. But the damage was done. The markets slumped, and the price that Italy had to pay to borrow leaped: averaged out, the spread moved by 0.65%. That may not sound like a big difference, but when applied to a mountain of debt the size of Italy\u2019s, it raises the interest bill by <a href=\"https://thegeneraltheorist.com/2020/03/15/loose-lips-cost-ships-lagardes-language-and-italys-eur14-billion-bill/\" title=\"\">as much as \u20ac14bn</a> for just one year. It was the last thing Italy needed. In a rare public rebuke, both Paris and Rome distanced themselves from the ECB. The crisis was pulling Europe further apart.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After five terrifying days of market turmoil, the weekend of 14-15 March was a moment for central banks around the world to coordinate their response. What everyone wanted was dollars, so it was above all the Federal Reserve that needed to take the lead. And as its chair, Powell did. He called an unscheduled press conference for the afternoon of 15 March. What he announced was remarkable.</p> <p>With immediate effect, the Fed was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cutting interest rates to zero</a> \u2013 something it had done just once before, at the height of the crisis in 2008. To stabilise the US Treasury bonds market, it would be buying $700bn in a new round of so-called quantitative easing. And it would start big, buying $80bn by 17 March. In the space of just 48 hours, it would spend more on treasuries than the Fed spent in most months in the aftermath of 2008.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were measures for the US economy. But the coronavirus was a global problem. The flight to safety and the ensuing rise in the dollar had put pressure on everyone who had borrowed in the US currency. So, to ensure that dollars could be piped to every financial institution in every major financial centre in the world, the Fed announced that it was <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-swaps/fed-increases-frequency-of-swap-line-operations-with-other-major-central-banks-idUKKBN21726G\" title=\"\">improving the terms</a> on the so-called liquidity swap lines \u2013 deals by which the major central banks agree to exchange dollars for sterling, euros, swiss francs and yen in unlimited amounts.</p> <p>Powell was deploying the main weapons of the 2008 crisis with far greater speed than his predecessors ever had. But it was still not enough. When the markets opened the next day, 16 March, the fall was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/markets-hit-by-further-losses-despite-us-interest-rate-cut-willie-walsh-ba-coronavirus\" title=\"\">vertiginous</a>. The circuit-breakers are supposed to come into effect if the market falls by more than 7%. That morning, the fall was so quick that the S&amp;P 500 dropped by 8.1% before trading could be stopped. The so-called fear index, VIX \u2013 a measure of market volatility \u2013 surged to levels last seen in the dark days of November 2008.</p> <p>The fear in the markets was now feeding on itself. If the Fed\u2019s magic of 2008 no longer worked, then what would?</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded, is the biggest market in the world. And the place where the most transactions are booked is the City of London. On an average day, transactions back and forth total $6.6tn. But on Wednesday 18 March, there was only one trade: people wanted to sell everything. The only thing they wanted to buy were dollars. Every other currency was falling.</p> <p>The central banks\u2019 failure to calm the markets had set the stage for the worst days of the panic. Coronavirus cases were piling up in Europe more rapidly than at the peak of the crisis in Wuhan. Hedge funds were placing multi-billion-dollar bets that the recession in Europe would be protracted. Blue chip companies like Apple were facing stiff premiums to borrow for as little as three months ahead. Even gold, a classic safe haven, was selling.</p> <p>That Wednesday, on his third day as governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey organised a press conference in an effort at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/19/stock-markets-fall-ecb-coronavirus-stimulus-sterling-oil-prices-ftse-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab#block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab\" title=\"\">reassurance</a>. But as he was speaking, sterling plunged by 5% to its lowest level since 1985. Meanwhile, the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts \u2013 the oldest major asset market in the world \u2013 was witnessing unprecedented turmoil. It was, in Bailey\u2019s understated phrasing, \u201cbordering on the disorderly\u201d.</p> <p>In response, the Bank of England monetary policy committee met the next day in emergency session and announced that the Bank would be buying \u00a3200bn in gilts. Unlike in 2008, it would not be doing so on a prearranged schedule. As Bailey explained: \u201cWe will act in the markets promptly and rapidly as we see appropriate.\u201d This was no time for timetables. The central bank was, by its own admission, flying by the seat of its pants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa/0_61_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an emergency conference call on the evening of 18 March, the ECB executive board decided that it, too, needed to act. Under a <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">pandemic</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">emergency</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">purchase</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">programme</a>, it announced that it would begin by buying \u20ac750bn of government and corporate debt. But the ECB was willing to go even further than that. It said that, if necessary, it would revise some of its \u201cself-imposed limits\u201d.</p> <p>For an institution as hidebound as the ECB, this amounted to a revolution. Self-imposed limits \u2013 inflation targets, rules on which European government\u2019s debt it could buy and in what quantities \u2013 are what the ECB lives by. It is clear that conservative members of the bank\u2019s governing council <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg200409_1~baf4b2ad06.en.html\" title=\"\">continued to resist such a move</a>. But in the end it was the turmoil in the markets that decided the issue. The ECB needed to send a signal of determination. If Lagarde had fluffed her \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d moment, the ECB was now at least promising to do whatever was necessary.</p> <p>By the end of the third week of March, 39 central banks around the world, from Mongolia to Trinidad, had lowered interest rates, eased banking regulations and set up special lending facilities. To ease the pressure on emerging markets, the Fed widened the network of liquidity swap lines to cover 14 major economies including Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. This was a remarkable wave of activism. But the pandemic itself was only beginning to bite. Central banks could cushion the financial shock, but not address the actual economic implosion, let alone the health crisis.</p> <p>European governments had been quick to move. Germany had thrown aside its fiscal caution and was committed to a <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200406/german-government-to-guarantee-100-percent-of-loans-to-smaller-firms-in-coronavirus-aid-package\" title=\"\">gigantic programme</a> of government guarantees for business lending. But this made all the more glaring the gap to Italy and Spain, which were not only hardest hit by the virus, but also constrained by the financial legacy of the eurozone crisis. They did not want to risk sliding back into a debt crisis.</p> <p>In the US, the Fed had leaped into action. But where were the politicians? Congress was distracted by the upcoming presidential election. What was needed was an unprecedented rescue package for an economy in freefall. How were Republicans and Democrats to reconcile fundamental differences over health care and unemployment insurance, or the notorious cronyism of the president and his clan? Since the Democrats had won control of the House of Representatives in 2018, legislation had been largely paralysed. Now, in the face of a tsunami of job losses, the two parties had to come to an agreement.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>As trading began in Asia early on the morning of Monday 23 March, the news from Washington made it clear that there had been no deal on Capitol Hill. The futures markets plunged so violently that circuit breakers were activated again \u2013 by now this had happened an unprecedented five times in two weeks. If it wanted to avoid a meltdown when Wall Street opened, the Fed would have to make another move.</p> <p>Until this point, Jerome Powell had been moving in the shadow of his predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who had been Fed chair in 2008. But by 23 March, Powell had activated all the basic elements of the 2008 repertoire \u2013 slashing interest rates, using quantitative easing, supporting money markets. But it had not worked, partly because it could not reach the source of the crisis itself \u2013 that is, the virus and the lockdown \u2013 and also because it was not reaching the bit of the credit system that was most vulnerable in 2020: the borrowing by big corporations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8/0_181_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Fed has always steered clear of corporate debt, which it considered politically sensitive. If you bought debt from individual firms, you were vulnerable to accusations of favouritism. If you bought a cross-section of debt you ended up holding many very poor-quality loans. But by the early hours of 23 March, it was clear that something had to be done to stabilise the corporate debt market. Since 2008, bonds issued by non-financial corporations have surged from $3.3tn to more than $6.5tn. If their value fell too far, US corporations would not only face shutdowns and a complete loss of revenue, but also a crippling credit squeeze.</p> <p>Ideally, the Fed would have made a grand announcement in conjunction with a Congressional stimulus package. But by the evening of 22 March, it was clear that the package being proposed by the Republicans was unacceptable to the Democrats. It might take days for them to square the difference. The financial markets would not wait.</p> <p>On 23 March, 90 minutes before markets opened, Powell made his move. He announced that the Fed was setting up legal entities \u2013 off the books of the Fed, but guaranteed by it \u2013 that would have the capacity to buy highly rated corporate debt, or at least any debt that the ratings agencies were still willing to declare investment-grade. In effect, the Fed was establishing itself as the backstop to the trillion-dollar corporate bond market. The Fed ramped up its asset-purchase programme, to an astonishing $375bn in Treasury securities and $250bn in mortgage securities in a single week.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary move to widen the scope of central bank intervention into the corporate economy. And it was understood as such by the markets. Since the start of the year, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones, as well as the FTSE 100, had lost 30% of their value. That day, they began to recover.</p> <p>Two days later, on 25 March, backing arrived from Congress when the Senate passed its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\" title=\"\">giant package of $2tn</a> \u2013 more than twice the size of the stimulus bill passed in 2009. It provided funds to top up unemployment insurance, to support small businesses and the US\u2019s privatised hospital system. Crucially, it also set aside $454bn to cover Fed losses. Since most loans would not be expected to go bad, this would enable the Fed to make more than $4tn in loans, if necessary.</p> <p>In the US, the public health campaign against the virus was still a shambles. But as far as economic policy was concerned, the full power of the American state was now being deployed behind the emergency programme. And the Fed was also acting as a provider of dollar liquidity to the world economy. In the UK, too, the Treasury and the Bank of England were working closely to link the huge increase in government spending to efforts to stabilise financial markets.</p> <p>But in the eurozone, that kind of coordination was lacking. The ECB had managed to stop the immediate panic. Yet there was still the question of whether the member states could come up with a financial plan to support their hardest-hit neighbours, Italy and Spain. The obvious solution was to issue debt jointly to fight the crisis together \u2013 an idea raised repeatedly during the eurozone crisis, when it had been bitterly resisted by a conservative northern European coalition led by Germany. This would ensure that Italy was not constrained by its pre-existing financial weakness.</p> <p>For a coalition of nine states led by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the case was obvious. On 25 March they called for a \u201ccommon debt instrument\u201d to fund a crisis response. The ECB threw itself energetically behind the proposal. But, once again, the Netherlands and Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/eu-coronavirus-relief-deal-enemies-debt-eurozone\" title=\"\">refused to budge</a>. The issue was shoved off into the Eurogroup, a meeting of the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, where the outline of a deal did finally emerge two weeks later. By then the immediate panic had passed. As Lagarde and her central banking colleagues had feared from the outset, it was on their shoulders that the stability of the eurozone continued to rest.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Will the massive financial firewalls built by central banks on both sides of the Atlantic be enough to withstand the bad news that is headed our way over the coming weeks and months? It is too early to tell. But the first test came on Thursday 26 March, when the US Department of Labor announced that, in a single week, 3.3 million Americans had signed on for unemployment insurance. It was completely unprecedented. A graph stretching back half a century simply turns upwards in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">vertical surge</a>. In the next two weeks, another 13.5 million people would be added to the insurance rolls. And there was no end in sight. America is on pace for national unemployment to reach 30% by the summer \u2013 greater than during the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>The shutdown spelled disaster for millions of American families, at least half of whom have no financial reserves to speak of, and for businesses up and down the land. How would the markets react? Astonishingly, they ended 26 March up 5%. The largest surge in unemployment ever recorded in history was met with a relaxed shrug.</p> <p>Why weren\u2019t investors more terrified? Because the scale of Congressional stimulus made clear that, no matter how divided American politics were, that wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of a huge surge of spending. And the Fed, for its part, would make sure that the huge flow of new debt was absorbed, if necessary on to its own accounts. The private credit system, the government budget and the balance sheet of the Fed were welded together in a closed loop.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>What the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB managed to do in March was prevent the damage caused by the shutdown being made even worse by an immediate collapse of corporate credit. At the same time, by stabilising sovereign debt markets, they have enabled a huge surge in public spending to fight the crisis and cushion its social and economic side effects. To do this they have both widened the safety net to parts of the financial system never before protected, and intervened on a scale far greater even than in 2008.</p> <p>In the final days of March, the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $83bn per day, or just shy of $1m per second. On 9 April, at the same moment as the latest horrifying unemployment numbers were released, it announced <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">another $2.3</a><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">tn</a> in support targeted specifically at municipal debt and lower-grade corporate debt. That same day, the Bank of England adopted an even more radical approach. Rather than going through the process of having the Treasury issue debt that would then be bought by the central bank, it announced that it would be offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\" title=\"\">direct monetary finance</a> to the government, to provide it with whatever funding it needed. This would be temporary, but it was still a radical move. The government\u2019s current account at the Bank of England would be repurposed to allow, if necessary, tens of billions of pounds in coronavirus spending. The last time the British government resorted to this mechanism was at the height of the crisis in 2008.</p> <p>What we have seen in the financial system, over the past few weeks, is a victory of sorts \u2013 but it is a defensive one. Once again, we are propping up a fragile, profit-driven system to avoid something even worse. It is also a victory limited in scope.</p> <p>By flattening the curve of financial panic, the central banks of advanced economies have managed to ensure that life under the lockdown is not made even more unbearable by the shutting off of credit to business and households. They have also ensured that the public health response to Covid-19 can proceed at any scale that is required. Within Europe, there are questions about the differences between eurozone members: Germany has been able to deliver a conspicuously larger fiscal response to the crisis than have Italy or Spain. But those inequalities pale next to the problems facing much of the rest of the world. There the crucial supply of credit is being cut off even before coronavirus cases begin to mount, meaning, once again we have confirmed that the global financial system is hierarchical. At the apex stands the US Federal Reserve. The ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and their advanced-economy counterparts all enjoy the Fed\u2019s direct support. Thanks in no small part to that support, the advanced-economy central banks enjoy great latitude in propping up their credit systems. They might face moderate movements in their currency\u2019s exchange rate, but no devastating financial squeeze.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\">\u2018We can\u2019t go back to normal\u2019: how will coronavirus change the world?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is what the emerging-market economies have been suffering since February.

Almost half the countries in the world \u2013 more than 90 so far \u2013 have been forced to <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/FAQ/imf-response-to-covid-19\" title=\"\">apply to the IMF</a> for financial assistance.</p> <p>If flattening the curve in Europe and the US was the battle of March, the next challenge is to reduce the shockwaves radiating out to the rest of the world. The last few weeks have seen a remarkable display of technocratic energy and imagination in western financial centres. That same level of commitment now needs to be brought to bear in supporting the rest of the world. We cannot control the epidemic or restore the world economy without it.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>After the early and unedifying bog-roll panic, the real shortage of the pandemic became clear: flour. Dried yeast, inevitably, was the next casualty. Price gougers on eBay were quick off the mark; by the middle of last week, a 1.5kg bag of plain flour (usually about \u00a31.50) was going for \u00a319. A pot of yeast (normally 98p) was almost a tenner. As supermarket shelves emptied, corner shops came into their own. They had stocked these store-cupboard essentials all along \u2013 who knew?</p> <p>The problem is partly operational. About 96% of flour from large millers is produced in bulk for bakers and food manufacturing, and that demand has stayed relatively stable. Demand from home bakers may have doubled, but since it was only 4% of the total, it is not the flour that is lacking so much as the ability to package smaller units in greater numbers. Across the country, most mills are running at full capacity, 24 hours a day. They are producing 4m bags a week, whereas previously they were producing 2m \u2013 yet it is still not enough.</p> <p>Smaller mills \u2013 catering to artisanal and microbakeries, as well as offering online orders to domestic bakers \u2013 ran out of flour. John Lister, the managing director of <a href=\"https://www.shipton-mill.com/\">Shipton Mill</a> in Gloucestershire, was having a rare day off on Easter Sunday and described the firm\u2019s conundrum. \u201cThere is only one speed, and that\u2019s pretty slow. If you tried to speed it up, the flour would become like gravel.\u201d Whereas an industrial mill produces 20 tonnes an hour, Shipton deals in kilos. \u201cIn a week, we would normally get about 400 microbakeries, as well as home bakers, placing an order online. We had a hilarious situation where we woke up one morning three weeks ago and found 10,000 orders on our website. At first we were laughing, then we were crying. We had to close down the online shop, but we couldn\u2019t work out how to stop orders coming through. It was like a dyke with a hole in it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"45f38cfabef216a9b4f6fed0aec7abff83fd5006\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45f38cfabef216a9b4f6fed0aec7abff83fd5006/0_0_3541_5313/667.jpg\" alt=\"Shipton Mill wholemeal flour\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is difficult for smaller mills such as Shipton Mill to increase output: \u2018There is only one speed, and that\u2019s pretty slow.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason Ingram/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It may turn out that it is easiest to tackle the problem by supplying shops with larger-than-usual sizes for domestic use, although whether anyone\u2019s enthusiasm for sourdough holds up when faced with a 16kg sack of flour is \u2026 wait, what am I saying? People would love that. They would rehome pets just to make space for it.</p> <p>Bread-making has become our port in the storm. With the world turbulent, unpredictable and, above all else, outside our control, baking loaves has become not only an act of self-sufficiency, but also one of agency: you are creating a place where the old rules still work. But there is so much more to it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/06/jeanette-winterson-nigella-lawson-classic-cookbook\">Nigella Lawson</a>, the ur-baker of the modern era, who evangelised these skills at the end of the last century, when carbs and slow cooking had fallen out of fashion, understands the impulse. \u201cOne of the ways to interrupt anxiety is to let other senses take over,\u201d she says. \u201cTouching things, smelling something, listening. Baking really has so much of that, because when you\u2019re kneading dough, or you\u2019re stirring a bowl, you are really immersed in the world of the senses. And that\u2019s really very important, because otherwise you\u2019re trapped in your mind, and that isn\u2019t right now a very comfortable place.\u201d</p> <p>Baking gives your day a structure, and fills the bizarre acreage of time that some of us have with manageable yet important waypoints: perhaps you have to wait four hours for your sourdough to prove, but at least those four hours have a beginning and an end. The thing to fight in a lockdown is drift, the sense (as my brother said the other day) that there is no longer any AM or PM, just coffee time and wine time.</p> <p>Allied to this is the immense sense of achievement, greater that the simple loaf in front of you. Lawson quoted the marvellous 70s cookery writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/21/ofm-classic-cookbooks-margaret-costa-four-seasons-cookery-book\">Margaret Costa</a>, who was born during the first world war: \u201cIt makes the baker see herself in an almost biblical light, as a valiant woman, whose children shall rise up and call her blessed.\u201d</p> <p>Ah yes, those pesky kids. When you have four walls and even half that number of children, any activity that isn\u2019t just mess, waste or nihilism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/cbeebies-the-clean-green-slightly-bonkers-world\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/cbeebies-the-clean-green-slightly-bonkers-world\">Beebies</a>) takes on a magical quality. You can make biscuits, but that is an hour at most and a ton of sugar. Baking bread can kill the entire afternoon.</p> <p>Lawson says this is more than a practical pursuit, however: \u201cWe all have a nostalgia for the childhood we didn\u2019t have, and you\u2019re creating that idealised space, as well as occupying your kids and trying to keep back the panic you may feel.\u201d It is also \u2013 newsflash, social media show-offs \u2013 not very difficult. \u201cWhen I wanted to do [her cookbook How to Be a] Domestic Goddess, everyone said to me: \u2018But no one bakes any more.\u2019 I think, for a lot of us who grew up cooking, we thought baking was something arcane and difficult. It\u2019s actually much easier. It\u2019s so much less frenetic. There tend to be fewer things going on than when you\u2019re cooking a meal and have this proliferation of pans.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All bread bakers feel united. People are baking bread in many different languages</p> <footer> <cite>Nigella Lawson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was working up a theory about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-great-british-bake-off\">The Great British Bake Off</a> being very closely allied to the Keep Calm and Carry On nostalgia aesthetic, so that, in a national crisis, baking becomes this quasi-patriotic act. Lawson quickly scotches all that. \u201cI think it\u2019s the opposite. All bread bakers feel united. People are baking bread in many different languages.\u201d This is why I admire Lawson. </p> <p>The place of bread in culture may have changed over the course of history, but it has never lost its resonance, as the food historian Polly Russell says. \u201cThe Assize of Bread and Ale in 1266 was one of the first food-supply regulations, basically adjusting the price of bread according to the price of wheat. It was to prevent people \u2013 bakers and millers \u2013 from profiteering, and it was socially crucial, because a labourer would be spending about half of their weekly income on bread. When prices go up, tensions go up very quickly as well.\u201d</p> <p>While there is no modern corollary in food, there is an obvious one in fossil fuels, with political parties vying to peg the wholesale price of gas to the retail price. Pre-industrialisation, bread was society\u2019s fuel and, as such, the driver of civil disorder: the French Revolution and the English bread riots of the 1790s are indistinguishable in provenance, even though their separate outcomes have given them very different profiles. The punishment for fraudulent bakers, who shortchanged their customers by swapping in sawdust or whatnot, was to be dragged by a horse, with the offending loaf tied round their neck \u2013 a testimony to the deadly seriousness of the baking business. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"744e41388845d6f0e971b0661f8583806b9d4fa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/744e41388845d6f0e971b0661f8583806b9d4fa5/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loaf of brown bread\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chorleywood process made white bread cheap and brown bread less so, ending the centuries-old association of brown loaves with poverty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apomares/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Long after we discovered other, more earth-shattering, fuels, the centrality of the loaf to the nation\u2019s wellbeing persisted. Russell continues: \u201cQuite recently, in the second world war and afterwards, there was the national loaf, which was a rationing manoeuvre.\u201d The loaf, introduced in 1942 and abolished in 1956, had a higher level of wheat extraction, so it contained more bran and grain \u2013 this not only stretched out wheat supplies, but meant the loaf was more nutritious, if denser, she says. This drab, wholemeal, stolid loaf became the symbol of this drab, wholemeal, stolid life. \u201cIt became associated with people feeling depressed,\u201d says Russell.</p> <p>For seven or eight centuries, white bread was associated with the rich and brown bread with the poor. This flipped in the 60s with the advent of mass production and the Chorleywood process, a method of bulk fermentation that speeds everything up, producing delicious squishy white processed bread that plays havoc with your guts. Thenceforth, white bread was cheap, brown bread less so. In this crisis, we have gone back to first principles \u2013 many people prefer the white brea they have made themselves. It is a great leveller.</p> <p>Some of this is idealised: for one, I don\u2019t find making bread as easy as all that. Homemade bread can be very solid, especially sourdough (Russell\u2019s tip: make sure your starter culture is lively enough by dropping a spoonful of it into water before you start; it should float). Also, my children don\u2019t rise up and call me blessed. They rise up and call me boomer. Yet the loaf has such an important place in our psyche: through it we can trace our society back to its first markets, its earlier moral contracts; making it, we can imagine ourselves back in control, providing for our families, passing on our knowledge; experimenting with it, we can briefly fancy ourselves chemists. It is a still point in a turning world. And you can eat it.</p>",

Pavel Chikov of the Agora International Human Rights Group noted that a more sophisticated system could be \u201ctoo expensive\u201d for many of the country\u2019s regions to employ.
