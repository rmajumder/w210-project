By 2014, the paper was staffed solely by Blayde Grzelka, a teenager fresh out of high school who was doing his best at his first media gig. He spent three days a week in Wagin, living in a room at the local pub, and filed to an editor an hour and a half away in Collie. The other two days he filed for the Fairfax paper in Mandurah.</p> <p>\u201cIt might have been a bit too much for me to handle at the time, but I made it work,\u201d Grzelka says.</p> <p>There were other problems. Advertising in the Argus had plummeted, and the lucrative Woolorama program was basically keeping the paper afloat. Blight recalls making the case for the Argus to a Fairfax executive, and being told to go and count the number of ads in a recent edition. There were five. \u201cI thought, \u2018wow, nothing could survive on that\u2019,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2705c73c9dace3bc4c704b8f0b8aa44ea0db435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2705c73c9dace3bc4c704b8f0b8aa44ea0db435/0_60_1280_964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coral Davies sits on printed copies of the Wagin Argus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coral Davies sits on printed copies of the Wagin Argus just before she retired in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wagin Argus \u2013 Coral Davies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So when The Argus finally folded, locals were sad, but not surprised. The model was broken. Few understand this better than Grzelka, who says he wrote for nine different Fairfax papers in regional WA between 2014 and 2017. As of this month, two are still printing.</p> <p>Wagin was an interesting place to cut his teeth, Grzelka says, but he became dispirited after encountering pushback on his attempts to write about mental health. As his career progressed, he struggled to find meaning in his work, and eventually left journalism.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end, when I was reporting there, I don\u2019t think I did a whole lot of good,\u201d he says, of the Argus. \u201cIt was just a thing that has always existed there, and they needed it to still exist, and that\u2019s why I was there.\u201d</p> <p>How are stories in Wagin told now? Some nearby towns still have newspapers owned by Seven West Media. The Narrogin Observer does a good job of covering the area, according to Blight, but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cNot your own town, not your own identity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t quite cut the mustard.\u201d</p> <p>Each time a country paper shuts down there is a ripple effect, spreading out to the smaller towns in its orbit. The Wagin paper used to cover the tiny towns of Dumbleyung and Lake Grace, now the Narrogin paper covers Wagin. \u201cAnything to the east of us, there wouldn\u2019t be a journalist within cooee,\u201d says Coral Davies.</p> <p>Social media plays a role, with some groups and pages devoted to sharing Wagin events and chatter. Everyone agrees that this leaves out many older people in the area.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re probably halfway between everyone being engaged with social media and no one being engaged with social media, so there\u2019s a vast tract of our community who wouldn\u2019t know what happened last week,\u201d Blight says. As Coral Davies puts it, the paper folded \u201ca generation too soon\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f7be8396409e452ccc26c4bead10d8ffbfd5dd13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7be8396409e452ccc26c4bead10d8ffbfd5dd13/0_0_183_276/183.jpg\" alt=\"Front page of the Wagin Argus from 1978\" width=\"183\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A front page of the Wagin Argus from 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wagin Argus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the Argus went, the local community resource centre started putting out a newsletter, the Wagin Wool Press.</p> <p>Jessica Hamersley, 70, is on the volunteer committee.

  "<p>In one of those strange circle of life things, about three years ago, I had <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/political-life/\">a conversation with Greg Combet</a> about how Australian politics could pull itself out of the death spiral of rolling leadership coups.</p> <p>Combet \u2013 one of Labor\u2019s brightest stars \u2013 had burned out during the leadership feud between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and with the grinding effort of legislating a carbon price in a minority parliament. Given he was a substantial loss to public life, I was interested in his thoughts about how things might become less toxic.</p> <p>Part of the problem, Combet thought, was Canberra\u2019s parliamentary culture was too insular, and the pace of governing was too punishing. One way to combat that would be adopting the American model, where people were recruited from outside the political system to serve in the cabinet or the executive. Recruiting high-powered outsiders from diverse backgrounds to mingle with the political lifers for a term of government would refresh the gene pool in the 2600 postcode, and allow some members of a government to focus exclusively on policy-making rather than having to juggle portfolio and representative responsibilities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/coalition-governments-homebuilder-grants-for-renovations-and-building-criticised-by-economists-and-backbench-mps\">Coalition government's grants for renovations and building criticised by economists and backbench MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a strange bit of happenstance, years later, Combet finds himself on Scott Morrison\u2019s National Covid-19 Coordination Commission. The NCCC is not the model Combet floated, because the commissioners are advisers, not decision-makers. But the group is not that distant from his outsiders-inside concept.</p> <p>The commission was a prime ministerial improvisation. Morrison pulled together a high-powered group of suits at the height of the Covid-19 crisis because he needed people with the skills to manage logistics in the economy. He needed people who knew how to find or conjure up essentials, like personal protective equipment, when global supply chains were profoundly disrupted.</p> <p>Nev Power, a former Fortescue executive, and a person with many corporate and philanthropic interests, including being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/23/covid-commission-boss-nev-power-steps-back-at-gas-company-amid-conflict-of-interest-concerns\">deputy chairman of a gas company</a>, Strike Energy, was drafted to run the show.</p> <p>The group began as troubleshooters and river guides, but it has evolved beyond the initial brief to become something of a kitchen cabinet for Morrison, providing advice on how the economy can recover after the pandemic. Covid has been a crisis where ad-hoc cabinets have proliferated. I\u2019ll come back to this point shortly, but first, we need to finish ventilating Combet\u2019s idea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So we have the bizarre situation of an in-house conflict of interest register that can\u2019t be scrutinised by the people paying for the enterprise \u2013 taxpayers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When he championed the idea of recruiting expert civilians to the heart of Australian governments in our conversation in 2017, Combet was clear doing this would require significant adjustments to governance. Given these external appointments would be funded by taxpayers, new forms of public accountability would need to be considered, perhaps a committee process that would deal solely with the draftees.</p> <p>But in this particular instance, we\u2019ve had the coordination commission constituted in haste, with accountability retrofitted in what looks to be chaotic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/05/government-refuses-to-release-conflict-of-interest-disclosures-from-covid-commission-members\">and patchy fashion</a>. A couple of quick examples. In the middle of May, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/13/nev-power-paid-500000-for-six-months-work-as-head-of-australias-covid-19-commission\">officials reported</a> NCCC commissioners were required to disclose any conflicts of interest ahead of any internal deliberations, but a special adviser to the commission on manufacturing, Andrew Liveris, the former chairman and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company, was not required to make a disclosure. It wasn\u2019t clear why not, because Liveris was obviously hands on, preparing advice recommending a taxpayer-backed expansion of the gas industry. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/21/leaked-covid-19-commission-report-calls-for-australian-taxpayers-to-underwrite-gas-industry-expansion\">draft of that advice later leaked</a>.</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, it was reported that Liveris was now required to make a declaration, but none of these declarations would be made public. We\u2019ve learned this week that commissioners are required to declare any potential conflicts of interest to one another, but Morrison\u2019s department is refusing to make these declarations public.</p> <p>So we have the truly bizarre situation of an in-house conflict of interest register that can\u2019t be scrutinised by the people paying for the whole enterprise \u2013 taxpayers.</p> <p>As well as accountability procedures obviously lagging the advice giving, the NCCC enterprise is expanding. It started with a budget of $3m, and that\u2019s now up to $5.4m. There\u2019s evidence of mission creep.</p> <p>A Senate committee examining the government\u2019s response to coronavirus heard this week a whole-of-government communications group had been located within the orbit of the commission rather than in the prime minister\u2019s department, which is a head-scratcher, given the NCCC started as a nuts and bolts group, evolved to a policy advisory group, and now is apparently contributing to government messaging. Through the commission\u2019s budget, taxpayers have funded a $500,000 market research program undertaken by Jim Reed, a long-term researcher for the Liberal party\u2019s pollster, Crosby Textor, who now has his own agency, Resolve Strategic. That contract was awarded by limited tender.</p> <p>As well as the extemporising, expanding, NCCC \u2013 the other ad-hoc revolution in governance we\u2019ve seen during Covid has been the creation of the national cabinet. I reported in early April that Morrison and the premiers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/the-two-meetings-that-changed-the-trajectory-of-australias-coronavirus-response\">invented the national cabinet on the fly</a> on 13 March after an arm wrestle in a Parramatta football stadium about how fast to impose restrictions enforcing social distancing. These characters are still making it up as they go.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem with constant crisis management is it can set you up for problems down the track</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The first thing to say is the national cabinet has worked during this terrible crisis. Australians have discovered that their federation functions. But leaders now want to preserve the crisis structure in perpetuity, and it\u2019s really not clear how that will work, or whether that idea is actually in the public interest.</p> <p>Morrison and the premiers presumably want to persist with the national cabinet, replacing the moribund bureaucratic creature of Coag, which in recent years had become a place where ideas go to die or be buried, because it represents a massive centralisation of government decision-making and an aggregation of power by leaders and treasurers. Cue clapping of hands.</p> <p>But tucking the national cabinet in as a committee of the federal cabinet (which I gather is the proposal) is a development that will reduce the transparency of government decision-making. It means deliberations by leaders will be conducted in secret, largely outside the realm of freedom of information requests, and scrutiny by parliamentary committees.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the practicalities. A few obvious questions present themselves. Do the states grasp that Morrison will likely set the agenda if the group works as a committee of the federal cabinet as opposed to Coag, where the agenda historically has been shared? Also: what happens if the federal cabinet overturns decisions of the national cabinet? What would that do to cooperative federalism?</p> <p>A few more questions. If the national cabinet is supposed to be bound by secrecy and solidarity (and I gather that\u2019s the intention), what happens during the first battle over health or education funding? Does everyone stay secret and solid, or does the predictable wailing and finger pointing resume? Also: does this new government of nine leaders, which could easily become a forum for captain\u2019s picks, marginalise ministers in state and federal governments, and if the answer to that question is yes, does that dynamic become a force for instability?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/scott-morrisons-call-for-australia-to-renovate-wont-rebuild-a-broken-economy\">Scott Morrison's call for Australia to renovate won't rebuild a broken economy | Van Badham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s been a lot of naysaying in this column, so let me make a couple of things clear. The first is governments cannot be expected to get everything right in a crisis. It\u2019s called a crisis for a reason, and we are lucky our governments have managed this pandemic competently.</p> <p>But the problem with constant crisis management is it can set you up for problems down the track.</p> <p>One more thing just for clarity. The point of me recounting a historic conversation with Combet is not to set him up in mortal conflict with the organisation he is now part of, the NCCC, because I have no evidence that\u2019s the case. The point of the stroll down memory lane is to highlight the intrinsic problems associated with putting the advice cart before the governance horse.</p> <p>For what it\u2019s worth, I think Combet, in-principle, was right: it is good for governments to open the windows and get a range of voices in (the emphasis here being range of voices, and the problem with the NCCC is the membership isn\u2019t diverse enough).</p> <p>But it\u2019s best that happens not as an improvisation, but as part of a carefully thought out strategy \u2013 otherwise the clean-up, rather than the contribution, becomes the story.</p> <ul> <li><p>Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor</p></li> </ul>",

Usually a leafy salad, a braised vegetable such as beans, roasted root vegetables and cooked greens.<br><br>Yes, it sounds like a lot of work for a little bit of meat, but think about it like this: the meat is one of the sides to the vegetable dishes, rather than the sun that everything else orbits around. For many of the sides, I use animal fats to roast or bake with, and salad dressing we can pre-make and refrigerate. With minimal reheating in the oven, I can turn out a weekday dinner in 20-30 minutes.<br></p> <h2><strong>Meatballs</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"198e7410e18e3f61abaabfaea1b70b4118630149\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/198e7410e18e3f61abaabfaea1b70b4118630149/0_1031_3840_3532/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pork Meatball Soup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"920\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is rare in traditional cuisines to eat a meatball plain, you will likely find them submerged in a sauce, sandwiched between two pieces of bread (a hamburger) or submerged in a sauce, as in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/mar/19/minced-pork-skewers-with-peanut-and-coriander-dressing-recipe-get-ahead-alex-bluett\">pork meatball soup</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Truly meatballs are one of the best creations our species has come up with to make do. This is a universal food, of which I have eaten many variations (sausages are a form of meatball) across a broad spectrum of cuisines from louk chin and naem to polpettes or wanzi. <br><br>The idea is to stretch out the meat \u2013 offal, skin, fat and other off-cuts such as muscle meat \u2013 as far as possible by grinding it up to a manageable coarse or finer mince, then incorporate herbs, vegetables, starches or eggs to bulk it up, making it tender and delicious. <br><br>It is rare in traditional cuisines to eat a meatball plain, you will likely find them submerged in a sauce, soups or sandwiched between two pieces of bread (a hamburger). <br><br>I make mine with a variety of fresh herbs, dried herbs and spices, eggs and sometimes coarsely chopped prawns, which can be shaped into meatballs or become stuffing for dumplings or ravioli. Any leftovers can be frozen. I cook these meatballs in a soup (made from stock that is cooked down bones, off cuts, feet, necks) with softer greens like wombok, mushrooms, fresh herbs such as celery leaves or coriander and tofu. It\u2019s hotpot style, but on the stove. Into the soup you can boost up your ferment intake by adding kimchi (kimchi stew) or stirring in some miso at the end, after you\u2019ve turned off the heat.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Stir frying</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37736eabb36f7013f6a0ce29cec4265a4066eb2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37736eabb36f7013f6a0ce29cec4265a4066eb2f/0_0_5687_3414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meat and leafy greens being stir fried in a wok.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you think you need a lot of meat to feel satiated, you may be surprised at how little you need with a stir fry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still my absolute go-to when I am time poor, but would rather eat food that I can cook, instead of ordering takeaway. For instance, last week I was given 250g of hangar steak by a neighbouring farmer who rears buffalo which I marinated then portioned into roughly 25g pieces. With that piece of hangar steak I\u2019ve been cooking up stir fries with lots of vegetables. I use<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/09/lard-di-dah-how-to-render-animal-fats\"> rendered fat</a> on a very hot wok to sear the sides of the steak. Once it\u2019s brown, I take that out then slice it very thinly. These pieces get tossed back into the wok as the vegetables are done cooking. <br><br>If you think that you need a lot of meat to feel satiated, you may find yourself surprised at how little you actually need with this method of cooking. The thing with stir frying is, because of the short cooking time and higher temperature, you want to slice your meat thinly to ensure that it is cooked perfectly without being too chewy.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Soups, curries, stews and braises</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e4bac12dc0a711b0347dc889f03e3d0fa43be94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4bac12dc0a711b0347dc889f03e3d0fa43be94/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bowl of chicken green curry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curries and stews are perfect for the cold weather.

Make it about the vegetables, then meat can play a supporting role like in gaeng keow waan (green curry) where often the whole chicken is broken down on the bones. This makes it more toothsome, and you will not have to use a stock as the base because by cooking the chicken on the bone, it will release so much more flavour. <br><br>The chicken often plays second fiddle to the apple eggplants, pea eggplants and fresh Thai basil \u2013 which is what I tend to fish for out of the pot \u2013 leftovers are often the best bit of making a big pot. There are so many wonderful tubers and root vegetables in season for soups and curries right now, like carrots, swedes, colourful potatoes, parsnips, rutabaga, celery and daikon, alongside all the leafy winter brassicas. Load it up with dried herbs in the beginning, and fresh herbs at the end of the cooking process.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Pasta, fried rice and congee</h2> <p>Starchy dishes are a great way to deliver a little bit of protein and a lot of vegetables. A bit of cured meat can go a long way to give flavour and fat to any of these. &nbsp;</p> <p>We are all on this planet together, so it is on us to solve its problems together. Our food consumption habits are directly linked to our broken food system, so it\u2019s time to put some real skin in the game. Even if it\u2019s as simple as cutting down your meat consumption and seeking out farmers who are trying to be better land stewards.</p>",

But the WHO guidance recommends more complex masks made of three layers of fabric for the general public taking public transport or going into shops or places of worship where they cannot keep their distance. It also says people over 60 or with underlying health conditions should wear medical masks in \u201csettings where physical distancing cannot be achieved\u201d because of \u201cincreased risk of infection and/or negative outcomes\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/facemasks-zip/giv-3902Yzq2SQnlDnat/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/facemasks-zip/giv-3902Yzq2SQnlDnat/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>All others should wear the three-layer fabric mask: absorbent cotton closest to the face, followed by a polypropylene layer and then a synthetic layer that is fluid-resistant, the WHO said.

Westminster.</p> \n  <p>But he said the UK government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \u201cmaking the

a strong appeal to protesters not to take part in demonstrations this weekend.</p> \n  <p>PSNI assistant chief constable Alan Todd said his officers are engaging with organisers of <strong>Black Lives

demonstrations across Northern Ireland this weekend over the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US last week.</p> \n  <p>Todd described the protest as \u201cvalid\u201d but warned that public gatherings of more than six people are against coronavirus regulations, as is travelling for a protest.</p> \n  <p>Up to 2,000 people gathered in Belfast city centre on Wednesday to express their support for the Black Lives Matter campaign.</p> \n  <p>The first minister <strong>Arlene Foster</strong> described it as a breach of the law and urged that there should be no repeat of it, while the deputy first minister <strong>Michelle O\u2019Neill </strong>said she was fully supportive of the BLM campaign but urged those involved to find other ways to show solidarity.</p> \n  <p>Todd said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I have a very clear message to organisers, the best way to resolve this for everybody\u2019s interests is to call off these events.</p> \n   <p>Large crowd protests are at this time inappropriate.</p> \n   <p>If people choose to ignore these warnings and with all the advice and guidance from the chief medical officer, healthcare professionals, from police, from political representatives across the spectrum, if people choose to ignore all that and break the law then there will have to be consequences.</p> \n   <p>People can take my messaging today as being my engagement with them, my explanation, and my encouraging them to obey the law - if they choose to ignore the first three Es they can expect over the weekend to find enforcement being used.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On any other day as a police service we would be fully facilitating those protests in a peaceful and lawful manner with the organisers, however this is not any other day, we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and gathering in crowds, socially distanced or otherwise, is both a risk to public health and a breach of the health protection regulations.</p> \n   <p>It seems to be somewhat ironic that we would protest the avoidable and unnecessary death of an individual in the United

of the public is protected, police officers and staff will not be able to disclose sensitive information to the NHS test-and-trace service.</p> \n   <p>The NPCC is in discussions with PHE to resolve

  "<p>After looking destined for Liverpool for so long, Timo Werner is set for his Premier League move \u2013 but heading to London rather than Merseyside and wearing blue rather than red, as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/04/chelsea-set-to-beat-liverpool-to-53m-signing-of-timo-werner\">move to Chelsea looms</a>. Nothing should be assumed yet, as what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/29/liverpool-still-hoping-to-sign-527m-timo-werner-with-player-keen-to-join\">appeared a done deal</a> for the soon-to-be Premier League champions went cold, with the prospect of paying the RB Leipzig forward\u2019s \u20ac60m (\u00a352.7m) release clause meriting greater reflection now than it did in a pre-Covid-19 altered reality. Yet all Chelsea have to do is meet the clause \u2013 and even in the current climate it is a deal that offers fine value \u2013 and to be truly wanted is a big deal to Werner.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/04/chelsea-set-to-beat-liverpool-to-53m-signing-of-timo-werner\">Chelsea set to beat Liverpool to \u00a353m signing of RB Leipzig's Timo Werner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Liverpool fans may scratch their heads as to why their club checked their run late on, particularly given Werner\u2019s keenness \u2013 the public praise of Liverpool and J\u00fcrgen Klopp (in excellent English) and suggestions of his own potential fit there \u2013 and the much-publicised Zoom call with the charismatic manager. Yet this apparent about-turn is not out of character with his career to date.&nbsp;</p> <p>Werner\u2019s path from becoming Stuttgart\u2019s youngest professional debutant and goalscorer in 2013, at 17, has been bumpier than the raw numbers and YouTube highlights would suggest. He is softly spoken but knows his own mind, and criticism over the last few years has only strengthened his resolve. It was expected for a long time that he would join Bayern Munich, but their deprioritising of Werner as they chased more cosmopolitan targets led to him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/aug/26/timo-werner-deal-rb-leipzig-underlines-why-bundesliga-can-be-three-horse-race\">surprisingly signing a new deal at the Red Bull Arena</a> last year, which included the current clause. When Hansi Flick recently made it clear he would love to pick up the thread and bring Werner to Bavaria after all, the player said he saw his future lying abroad.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Attacks on Leipzig \u2013 banners, chants, thrown paint and bull heads \u2013 widened to incorporate very personal attacks on Werner</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Events had made Werner tough and adaptable. In summer 2016 he took the plunge and joined newly promoted RB Leipzig, and it changed his footballing life \u2013 on one hand in the way he would have hoped for and on the other in transforming his image in a way he would have perhaps struggled to have foreseen. Stepping into a focused, organised, nurturing environment at the age of 20 helped him realise his potential. He scored six Bundesliga goals for a dysfunctional Stuttgart in his final season there (his best total at that stage) as they stumbled to a ruinous relegation; in the following campaign at Leipzig he rattled in 21, despite playing fewer games than the season before.</p> <p>Werner paid a price, though. What he gained in terms of on-pitch support and aptitude he lost in respect of his image. Having apparently fled the sinking ship of his hometown club \u2013 that he netted them a much-needed initial fee of \u20ac10m, Leipzig\u2019s club record at the time, is sometimes glossed over \u2013 Werner attracted opprobrium for joining (and undeniably strengthening) a club whose mere presence in the top flight many German football fans found impossible to stomach. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/sep/08/why-rb-leipzig-has-become-the-most-hated-club-in-german-football#maincontent\">The attacks on Leipzig</a> \u2013 banners, chants, thrown paint and bull heads \u2013 widened to incorporate very personal attacks on Werner, which escalated after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/dec/05/bundesliga-leipzig-timo-werner-dive-controversy\">took a dive in a win over Schalke</a> in December 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"273213ac8d7ccf74351c52a761df38bb5f09b34d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/273213ac8d7ccf74351c52a761df38bb5f09b34d/0_0_3410_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timo Werner\u2019s dive to win a penalty against Schalke in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timo Werner dives to win a penalty against Schalke in 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schluter/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pop singer Ikke H\u00fcftgold even released Hurensohn (son of a bitch), set to the tune of Belinda Carlisle\u2019s Heaven Is A Place On Earth and based on a derogatory terrace chant about Werner, as a summer party anthem in 2017. H\u00fcftgold did point out the refrain was actually \u201cImo Erner ist kein Urensohn\u201d and claimed he wanted to \u201cdefuse the situation with humour\u201d, but the production of T-shirts emblazoned with \u201cTimo Werner ist ein Hurensohn\u201d in German-heavy resorts in Mallorca that summer suggested the nuance had been lost on many.</p> <p>\u201cIt is less about Werner\u2019s dive,\u201d wrote 11 Freunde\u2019s Stephan Reich in June 2017, \u201cand more about the jersey in which he made it.\u201d The sensitive Werner was affected by the abuse and by the whistles he received while playing for Germany (though there were enough other culprits for the shambolic defence of the World Cup in Russia that he, hidden away on the wing in a failing team, escaped much censure).</p> <p>Having come through all this, Werner is enjoying a career-high season at 24 under the guidance of Julian Nagelsmann. The young coach has started to broaden Leipzig\u2019s palette, much as he did progressively at Hoffenheim but clearly with a higher quality set of players, moving them far beyond being simply a team of skilled counterpunchers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4535a43a0bcba332a18c758de5f956f991c16382\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4535a43a0bcba332a18c758de5f956f991c16382/505_0_3731_2240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner earlier this year at Stuttgart equates the despised Dietmar Hopp to Timo Werner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner earlier this year at Stuttgart equates the disliked Hoffenheim owner, Dietmar Hopp, to Timo Werner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixathlon/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This switch has done likewise for Werner. He had seen early how he and his team might be typecast as one-trick ponies, only capable on rapid breaks, when he mused in Leipzig\u2019s second Bundesliga season that opponents would give his team the ball and challenge them to break them down. Nagelsmann has largely resisted the temptation to place Werner on the left wing, where he is highly capable (and from where he caused Sweden problems even in the wreckage of that desperately poor 2018 World Cup campaign).&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead, he has been the coach\u2019s go-to centre-forward, still with the pace to blaze clear of the defence should the opportunity arise as his goal in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jun/01/cologne-v-rb-leipzig-bundesliga-live\">Monday\u2019s win at Cologne </a>showed, but also with the craft and shooting power to take on more deeply set defences. That tendency to drift out to the left, Thierry Henry-style, will never leave his game but Nagelsmann seems to have decided it should be a complementary attribute to his arsenal rather than a vocation.&nbsp;</p> <p>Everything suggests it is a skillset that will quickly pay dividends in the Champions League. Werner is prepared and already knows he has the tools to succeed, whatever the destination.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>On April 4 1968, Martin Luther King Jr phoned a local pastor with the title of his Sunday sermon: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/mlks-children-reveal-undelivered-king-speech-america-may-go-hell/240264/\" title=\"\">Why America May Go to Hell</a>.\u201d The civil rights leader was shot dead before he could address the parishioners of Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta. Over the next few weeks the United States found itself on the road to perdition. King\u2019s murder saw the country experience its greatest wave of social unrest since the civil war, with riots in 130 cities. In November of that year, Richard Nixon won a law and order election by stoking the unspoken bigotry that the street violence had done so much to revive. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/floyd-trump-nixon-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">thinks he can do the same</a> with the nationwide protests over police brutality toward African Americans in the wake of the death of George Floyd. But history does not repeat itself, people do.</p> <p>There are signs that Americans have grown to be significantly better than their previous selves. The protests have drawn wide support from society. Mainly peaceful demonstrations have been a showcase for America\u2019s diversity. Mr Trump\u2019s polling numbers have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-campaign-virus-protests-polls.html\" title=\"\">plunged</a>. Surveys show that voters approve of the protests inspired by Floyd\u2019s death, and strongly disapprove of the president\u2019s response. There has been a sea change in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-lots-of-white-democrats-ended-up-protesting-the-death-of-george-floyd/\" title=\"\">attitudes</a>, with Americans seeming to acknowledge that racism is a real problem for their society. The police officer who was seen suffocating Floyd with his knee has been charged with second-degree felony murder. Confederate statues and other relics to racism have come down in several states.</p> <p>There is also a long way to the 2020 presidential election. The demonstrations and violence may be a faraway memory by then. The political gaze may be fixed on a second coronavirus outbreak or the failing economy. The chaotic handling of the pandemic has left 100,000 dead and is evidence that Mr Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-world-leaders\" title=\"\">not up to the job</a>. The past is also another country. The unrest today is against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-coronavirus-us-unemployment-could-hit-25-warns-fed-chairman-as-japan-enters-recession\" title=\"\">depression</a>, deprivation and deep inequality, not the full employment and roaring US economy of the late 1960s. The portents do not look good for a president running for re-election.</p> <p>The story of American politics since 1968 is dominated by a Republican party that gained a <a href=\"http://omarwasow.com/APSR_protests3_1.pdf\" title=\"\">political base</a> through Nixon\u2019s explicit appeals to whites who resented or were opposed to the civil rights movement. Republican leaders went on to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/09/29/reagan-blames-crime-on-human-predator/2892636f-d176-48fb-b06b-39012eace1f4/\" title=\"\">weaponise racism</a> to remain in power, which they used to pursue policies that enriched the already affluent at the expense of ordinary workers. Mr Trump\u2019s Republicans are the \u201c<a href=\"https://portside.org/2020-03-18/how-racist-trumps-republican-party\" title=\"\">white grievance party</a>\u201d. This racism is laced with Trumpian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-hydroxychloroquine-live\" title=\"\">stupidity</a>.</p> <p>African Americans have been left behind: being black in America, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/obituaries/devah-pager-dead.html\" title=\"\">studies</a> show, is like having a criminal conviction in terms of one\u2019s chances of finding employment. Black people often live in the poorest areas and suffer the highest rates of unemployment. Relative to white people, black people receive longer sentences for the same crimes, are treated more disrespectfully by police in routine interactions, and are more likely to be shot by law enforcement. Blacks have long outnumbered whites in US prisons despite representing a fraction of the total population. So stacked is the deck against them that black boys \u2013 even rich black boys \u2013 can never assume <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html\" title=\"\">they can escape the poverty trap</a>. This is not a recipe for social comity.</p> <p>King understood this. His <a href=\"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/29/minneapolis-protest-martin-luther-king-quote-riot-george-floyd/5282486002/\" title=\"\">warning</a> in 1967 that the worsening conditions for black Americans must be condemned as equally as riots is still true. \u201cA riot is the language of the unheard,\u201d said King. \u201cOur nation\u2019s summers of riots are caused by our nation\u2019s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.\u201d America must do more than listen to the unheard, it must hear them.</p>",

It first detonated a nuclear bomb in 1966 to put out an oil well fire at the Urtabulak gas field in Uzbekistan, which was then part of the USSR.</p> <p>The wellhead fire is not the only widespread industrial accident in Russia. Earlier this week, Vladimir Putin ordered a state of emergency after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/03/vladimir-putin-orders-state-of-emergency-huge-fuel-spill-siberia-power-plant-kerch\">20,000 tonnes of diesel fuel </a>spilled into a river inside the Arctic Circle. Images from satellites showed kilometres of the Ambarnaya River turned red by the toxic fuel. The fuel came from a tank that collapsed at a power plant, likely due to melting permafrost caused by global warming. Russian officials have said it could take months or years to clean up the damage to the local ecosystem.</p>",
  "<p>A consensus that international cooperation is required to limit the danger from global heating has existed for decades. The success of the rearguard action against this knowledge, led by fossil fuel interests, is a catastrophe whose full extent is yet to unfold. Central bankers are now demanding that a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/05/world-climate-breakdown-pandemic#maincontent\" title=\"\">whole economy transition</a>\u201d must follow the pandemic if the world is to avoid the extreme disruption that temperature rises of 4C would bring.</p> <p>Arguably, the chaos unleashed by coronavirus has made such a future seem less remote, and action to prevent it more necessary. The risk is that the virus will have the opposite effect: focusing minds on the threat right now rather than the one that can be ignored for a few more years.</p> <p>Nowhere is this danger greater than in Brazil. South America\u2019s most populous country is responsible for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions\" title=\"\">2.25% of global emissions</a> (by comparison, the US, with a population 50% bigger, emits seven times as much). But accelerating deforestation places Brazil, which has 60% of the Amazon rainforest within its borders, at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/amazon-matter-of-life-and-death-for-all-of-us-we-must-fight-for-it\" title=\"\">heart of the struggle</a> to prevent runaway global heating. That is because the Amazon is the planet\u2019s biggest terrestrial carbon sink and plays a crucial role in the water cycle, as well as providing a home to more species than anywhere else on land.</p> <p>Twenty-eight years ago, in June 1992, the UN framework convention on climate change was opened for signature in Rio de Janeiro. But since Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, took office 18 months ago his government has sabotaged years of work by environmentalist and indigenous activists aimed at protecting the rainforest, and instead fanned the flames of its destruction by illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers. In the year to July 2019, losses rocketed to 9,800 sq km and research predicts that the rainforest is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/tropical-forests-losing-their-ability-to-absorb-carbon-study-finds\" title=\"\">on course for a tipping point</a> that would see it become a carbon emitter in the mid-2030s. Now there are fears that the coronavirus pandemic may speed this up.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-brazil-record-daily-death-toll-mexico\" title=\"\">Brazil overtook Italy</a> to become the country with the third-highest Covid-19 death toll (behind the US and UK), after a daily record of 1,743 fatalities took the total to more than 34,000. While Mr Bolsonaro continues to attack public health measures, the indigenous population of the Amazon region appears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/brazil-using-coronavirus-to-cover-up-assaults-on-amazon-warn-activists#maincontent\" title=\"\">increasingly under threat</a> from violence as well as disease, with five killings in Maranh\u00e3o state in six months.</p> <p>The tropical rainforest may seem distant. But we cannot afford to wring our hands and look away. Every possible lever must be pulled that could influence Brazil\u2019s government and meat industry. This week, the Guardian reported that UK banks have provided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/04/revealed-uk-banks-and-investors-2bn-backing-of-meat-firms-linked-to-amazon-deforestation\" title=\"\">more than $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) in backing</a> to companies linked to deforestation. Those institutions must now come under pressure, along with US investors such as BlackRock. So must politicians and regulators.</p> <p>It will take a huge international effort to preserve the Amazon rainforest. Agribusiness is responsible for more than one-fifth of Brazil\u2019s GDP. If the cattle industry is to face curbs, there must also be incentives. International trade and climate negotiators have their work cut out. There is a job to be done by public opinion too.</p>",
  "<p>When the 2019-20 W-League season <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/w-league-grand-final-offered-an-answer-to-footballs-existential-question\">wrapped up in March</a>, it became the last professional football league in the world to complete a full calendar unaffected by the coronavirus shutdown.</p> <p>While the grand final between Melbourne City and Sydney FC was played in front of a skeleton crowd of family and friends, the game itself went ahead as planned. By virtue of its short season length, the league managed to slide in under the world\u2019s lockdowns, like Indiana Jones beneath a rapidly descending stone doorway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/03/anson-dorrance-we-raise-young-women-to-not-be-competitive-what-the-heck-is-going-on\">Anson Dorrance: 'We raise young women to not be competitive. What the heck is going on?' | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the simile doesn\u2019t end there: Football Federation Australia has proved itself a nimble and adaptable figure internationally, too. Earlier this year, in the space of just two weeks, the organisation negotiated moving the Matildas\u2019 entire Olympic qualifying group from Wuhan to Sydney, including organising stadiums, hotels and training grounds for all four participating national teams. The league responded well to those shifting calendars, moving a handful of games around to ensure all Matildas players would be available for the competition\u2019s scheduled conclusion.</p> <p>While its neat finish has meant the W-League has been largely out of sight as Australian clubs and administrators have worked to see out the A-League season, the flexibility shown by football\u2019s decision-makers in the women\u2019s space could prove invaluable in the months ahead.</p> <p>Around the world, in a wearyingly predictable fashion, many women\u2019s clubs and leagues have been significantly warped or sacrificed altogether as their men\u2019s equivalents have steamed towards a restart. Leagues in France, Spain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/fa-criticised-binning-womens-super-league-alison-mcgovern\">and England</a> have all been cancelled (with Italy likely to follow), while the NWSL in the United States has <a href=\"https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/article/nwsl-announces-2020-challenge-cup-presented-by-pg-and-secret\">morphed into the Challenge Cup</a>: a 25-game World Cup-style knockout tournament that will run for just one month.</p> <p>The question hanging over many of these leagues now is: what happens next? For Europe\u2019s \u201cbig five\u201d \u2013 France, Spain, England, Italy, and Germany \u2013 kick-off for the 2020-21 season is slowly approaching. All five leagues usually begin their seasons in August or September and conclude in May the following year, while the NWSL is traditionally held between April and October. But there is no knowing whether the leagues are still working toward these original dates, just as there\u2019s no knowing whether a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe and the US could cause further (and possibly fatal) disruptions to them.</p> <p>For international players caught up in league and contract insecurity, then, the W-League is becoming a rather enticing proposition. Still far enough in the future that international travel restrictions could be lifted, in a country that is tracking well in terms of new Covid-19 cases (meaning its four-month season could be played out unhindered \u2013 perhaps even with crowds), and with the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics just a few months after its conclusion, the W-League is perfectly placed to capitalise on the global uncertainty currently facing the domestic women\u2019s game.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time Australian women\u2019s football has had to be logistically nimble. Just as the W-League adjusted its calendar in 2014 to account for Australia hosting the 2015 men\u2019s Asian Cup, the competition could shift slightly to reduce the gap between its conclusion and the start of the Olympics, meaning players wouldn\u2019t risk losing match fitness between the two competitions.</p> <p>In addition, extending the W-League to a full home-and-away season while also adding an extra club \u2013 two suggestions that are part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/wide-reaching-plans-for-independent-w-league-revealed\">the league\u2019s long-term vision</a> \u2013 would provide more game-time for Olympic-bound Matildas as well as more opportunities for international players to prepare themselves for the second-biggest women\u2019s football tournament on the planet.</p> <p>A temporary expansion of international visa spots could be another way of enticing foreign players desperate for game-time ahead of Tokyo, while more flexible player loan agreements between Australian and international clubs could ensure that international players contracted to clubs in less stable leagues could continue to play football in a competitive, professional environment while their parent leagues get themselves in order.</p> <p>And as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/21/australia-and-nzs-womens-world-cup-bid-highlights-a-global-shift\">2023 Women\u2019s World Cup decision looms</a>, such domestic moves could be perfectly timed to ride the wave of enthusiasm generated if Australia\u2019s joint bid with New Zealand proves successful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/29/wolfsburg-cologne-frauen-bundesliga-freiburg-leverkusen\">Wolfsburg thrash Cologne as Frauen Bundesliga bucks trend with restart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFFA\u2019s intent remains for the W-League 2020-21 season to return in and around its usual season window,\u201d an FFA spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, the season window is always assessed and reviewed annually to ensure we can optimise the W-League for players, fans and partners.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our competition design planning and finalisation timelines for the 2020-21 season and we are not in a position to confirm any further details at the moment. However, we absolutely remain committed to continuing to professionalise, grow and showcase the women\u2019s game in Australia and the W-League remains a key element in that commitment.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>If the W-League can show the same adaptability as it did earlier this year by pouncing upon the current uncertainty facing the domestic game elsewhere, it could set Australian women\u2019s football on a new and potentially more prosperous course.</p>",

She must have been more worried about the health of the child inside her than about her own hunger,\u201d said Krishnan.</p> <p>Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan confirmed that an investigation was being carried out into the elephant\u2019s death, and that one arrest had been made.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to assure you that your concerns will not go in vain.

Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar called the death of the elephant \u201cheartbreaking, inhumane and unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>However, the issue took another nasty turn after it was co-opted by rightwing Hindu nationalists, who blamed a Muslim community for deliberately carrying out the killing.</p> <p>Maneka Gandhi, a member of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), alleged that the elephant had been killed in Malappuram district, which has a 70% Muslim population, despite it being over 50 miles west from River Velliyar in Palakkad where she actually died.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s murder,\u201d said Gandhi, who is a prominent animal rights activist. \u201cMalappuram is famous for such incidents, it\u2019s India\u2019s most violent district.

The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhoea.

Instead of bustling restaurants, they will find distanced dining zones on the street where cars used to be. </p> <p>But some will also find floral stencils designed to remind them to keep their distance, instead of bright yellow warning signs making them so nervous they go straight home. As retailers prepare for the uncertainty of non-essential shops in England reopening on 15 June, many have concluded that innovation is their only chance of survival.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the same time as they plot their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/which-uk-shops-are-reopening-and-when-as-covid-19-lockdown-eases-john-lewis-mcdonalds\">immediate steps to woo shoppers back</a>, others are hopeful that the coronavirus crisis could prompt a deeper reimagining of how we spend our lives as consumers \u2013 and trade identikit retail parks and soulless town centres for a utopian new vision of a community-led \u201c15-minute city\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s loads going on,\u201d said Chris Turner, the chief executive of British BIDs, which represents business improvement districts, ratepayer-funded bodies that invest in changes to local public spaces. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge commitment to making places attractive and welcoming as shops reopen.\u201d</p> <p>Amid concerns that the measures required to ensure a safe reopening could leave people fearful, town centres are experimenting with different options to encourage shoppers to venture out.</p> <p>In Leamington Spa, rather than forbidding red or yellow warning signs, the public will be reminded of 2 metre physical distancing requirements with stencils of flowers to reflect the town\u2019s horticultural history. \u201cWe wanted pavement graphics that would be less authoritative and more welcoming,\u201d Stephanie Kerr, the local BID\u2019s executive director, said <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8344075/Birmingham-Leamington-Spa-Stratford-Avon-unveil-pavement-markings-social-distancing.html\">when the signage launched</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b11bb2b62342139ea03a8ed5beffe82ae3c3c18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b11bb2b62342139ea03a8ed5beffe82ae3c3c18/0_0_3912_2606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social distancing floor markings on the Parade, Leamington Spa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social distancing floor markings on the Parade, Leamington Spa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Hughes/SWNS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She said a pilot found children were more willing to abide by the rules because the imagery was \u201cfun and interesting\u201d.</p> <p>Turner said other innovations shoppers could expect to see included being asked to make appointments to browse at clothing shops to avoid overcrowding. Meanwhile, restaurants in cities including Cardiff and Bristol will share physically distanced tables outside and ask customers to order and pay via an app to avoid having to hand card readers or cash back and forth.</p> <p>With no official advice on how shops should calculate the number of customers they can accommodate, a <a href=\"https://www.highstreetstaskforce.org.uk/resources/details/?id=bc16b6bc-0ebb-4b7b-8df8-d8aa6b9a3a9f\">new study</a> from Manchester Metropolitan and Cardiff universities suggests that 10-12 sq metres is necessary per person depending on location.</p> <p>That has led to calls for more towns and cities to consider temporarily pedestrianising busy shopping streets, because overlapping queues on pavements could cause chaos.</p> <p>Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, said the current guidance was \u201cvery subjective\u201d. He added: \u201cYou may have very similarly sized shops with different numbers allowed in \u2013 and then what does the consumer feel? If there\u2019s a lot of variation it could create tension on the high street.\u201d</p> <p>With so many variables in play and little clarity about how consumers will respond, most retailers are yet to set out their plans for reopening. Ronald Nyakairu, a senior analyst at the Local Data Company, said that of 4,000 multiple branch retailers in the country, only 20 or 30 had announced their intentions so far.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe questions we\u2019re being asked by clients are changing all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been harder to be a retailer.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/coronavirus-lockdown-rules-what-is-allowed-in-england-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland\">Lockdown rules: what is allowed in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With little concrete information available, retailers must assess whether their stores are in areas that are likely to see a return of significant shopping footfall. That means smaller outlets considering whether they are near a major \u201canchor\u201d such as a supermarket or people\u2019s homes, says Nyakairu. Those in areas with an older population, or in leisure-focused areas with lots of bars and restaurants, may face a longer wait.&nbsp;</p> <p>There have been warnings for some time that without more \u201cexperiential\u201d retail or reasons for people to travel to a high street other than just shopping, these central points of Britain\u2019s communal life will wither in the face of online retail.</p> <p>Despite the many reasons for pessimism, though, there are those who hope that the crisis will help bring about an overdue change in our high streets and shared spaces \u2013 and open the way to an almost utopian future.&nbsp;</p> <p>Finn Williams, the co-founder of Public Practice, a social enterprise aimed at improving the built environment, points to the Parisian concept of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/paris-mayor-unveils-15-minute-city-plan-in-re-election-campaign\">15-minute city</a> \u2013 locally self-sufficient communities with everything from groceries to parks and workplaces within a walk or bike ride of home.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no going back,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have to think not just about what happens in town and city centres but what happens closer to home. Town planning traditionally works by zoning stuff together \u2013 but now there is a need to mix things up.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He argues that communities could be boosted as bigger companies focus more on online retail and allow \u201creally local neighbourhoods\u201d to spring up with a bigger purpose than consumerism. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect people to come from miles around,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully by scraping away a layer of the less useful retail, you get to some of the core functions of a high street that are deeper, and about the social and civic purpose.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Prof Cathy Parker, one of the authors of the study, said that in her home town of Macclesfield, an agile response to extraordinary circumstances had been made harder by centralised decision-making from big chains. She wants to see companies hand responsibility on everything from stock to opening hours to window displays to local staff, who understand the specific dynamics at work.</p> <p>But she, too, argued that a more hopeful future could emerge from the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThe new partnerships that have been formed, the new businesses that people seem to value, how they want to walk and cycle more, air quality, greenery \u2013 these are things that people are going to want from their towns and high streets after it\u2019s all over,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to go back to their stressed lives, and horsemeat burgers. We have to make sure that as this regeneration happens, something really good comes out of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020.

  "<p>Despite disagreement among scientists, we will soon have to wear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">cloth face coverings on public transport</a>. The policy could be extended to places such as shops where social distancing is difficult.&nbsp;</p> <p>Passions run high on this issue. I have some sympathy with the person who demanded that scientists should be locked in a room and not let out till they agree the facts.&nbsp;Except that this debate is as much about values as facts.</p> <p>One of my colleagues is a philosopher of science. On day one of his course, he sends his students out to \u201cgo and get a fact, and bring it back to class\u201d. When they return, he invites them, one by one, to carefully present and defend their fact against critique from fellow students. How was it sourced? How was it measured? Does it stand firm now that it has been plucked from its context?&nbsp;No fact ever survives in the form that the student presents it. The lesson is that being rigorous and systematic in producing a fact does not make that fact absolute.</p> <p>Take randomised controlled trials, for example. Surely it\u2019s good science to take a sample of people during a pandemic, randomly allocate half of them to wear cloth face coverings, and look for a statistically significant difference in how many develop the disease?&nbsp;</p> <p>Let\u2019s unpack the quest for that particular fact. First, let\u2019s design the intervention. As laboratory studies have shown, fabric materials are good at stopping large viral-laden droplets on their way <em>out</em>, but they\u2019re not very good at stopping tiny airborne viral particles on the way <em>in</em>. So the intervention we need to test is something called source control: the effectiveness of my cloth mask in protecting you; yours in protecting me.</p> <p>Let\u2019s therefore test, in all members of the general public (population), the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/04/do-face-coverings-reduce-risk-and-spread-of-coronavirus\">impact of cloth face coverings</a> (intervention) compared to no coverings (control) in public places (setting) for preventing infection in other members of the public (outcome).</p> <p>There have never been any such trials.<strong> </strong>Why not?&nbsp;Because such a trial would be impossible. Which people, exactly, would you randomise? Everyone who lives in a particular street? Everyone who catches a particular bus? To be included in a randomised trial, people have to give informed consent and agree to comply with the intervention. If only a small proportion agrees, how many streets or bus-loads or squares-full of people would you need to invite in order to get enough to generate your \u201cfact\u201d?</p> <p>How would you test the hypothesis that <em>my</em> mask protects <em>you</em>? This is problematic because, instead of just following up with one individual who is already signed up to the study (me), you\u2019d somehow need to identify a fraction of all the people I came into contact with as I went about my life, and test each of them to see if they developed the disease. But none of those other people (random street-dwellers or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/fewer-than-four-in-10-people-in-uk-wear-a-face-covering-guardian-survey\">bus passengers</a> or square-crossers) agreed to be in the trial in the first place. You simply can\u2019t study them like laboratory animals (though someone has done a randomised controlled trial to show that face coverings are highly effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa644/5848814\">transmission in hamsters</a>).</p> <p>In order to \u201cdo science\u201d on the effectiveness of face coverings in the real world, you would either have to define some kind of closed system to be your sampling frame, say a school or home environment, or compromise and study the effect of mask-wearing on the <em>wearer</em> rather than on other people. And that\u2019s what scientists have done.</p> <p>I\u2019ve reviewed all the published <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jep.13415\">randomised trials on masks and face coverings</a> for the general public in a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The trials consist of studies of mask-wearing in closed systems and of masks to protect the wearer, usually at specific mass events (notably, pilgrimages to the Hajj). Furthermore, all these studies were done some time ago when the prevailing diseases were colds and flu. None looked at prevention of Covid-19.</p> <p>What did these not-terribly-relevant trials show? Masks seemed to provide some protection for the wearer, but effects were small and usually not statistically significant (perhaps because studies were just too small to produce a clear answer). Masks given in the home, for example to protect the parents of a child with flu from catching it themselves, didn\u2019t have much effect \u2013 but then they weren\u2019t worn much (for a variety of reasons including \u201cchild did not like parent wearing mask\u201d).&nbsp;</p> <p>These findings are facts of a sort. I\u2019d love to discuss them with my philosopher colleague\u2019s students. But the bottom line is we have no directly relevant facts from randomised controlled trials of source control in Covid-19. What now? Demand that policy should not change until the much-desired randomised trial exists? Or suck it and see?&nbsp;Here\u2019s where values come in.</p> <p>Randomised trials were developed to test drugs. As we know from thalidomide, new drugs can cause terrible harm. Scientists arguing for caution in the masking debate are almost all medically trained and view the principle \u201cdo no harm\u201d (by which they mean, never give a new drug to any patient before it\u2019s been tested in a randomised trial) as overriding.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/05/britons-immune-coronavirus-mistakes-covid-19-spread\">Less than 10% of people in Britain are immune to coronavirus.

Public health scientists value natural experiments highly because they view the trade-off between real-world achievability and experimental ideals as worthwhile. </p> <p>Like dozens of other countries, England is about to have a natural experiment of face coverings in public places. Still, the scientists will continue to argue. If transmission rates of Covid-19 fall as predicted, public health experts \u2013 and I count myself among them \u2013 will say this has produced a \u201cfact\u201d that face coverings are effective source control.&nbsp;And triallists will say that in the absence of a trial (which they will continue to demand), this is not a fact because there\u2019s no robust evidence that the association is causal.&nbsp;Whether we can agree on \u201cthe facts\u201d or not, we\u2019ll hopefully welcome the positive outcomes, as I predict that transmission of Covid-19 will fall and that any harms will be relatively minor and worth the trade-off.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;Trish Greenhalgh is a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University</p>",

That\u2019s created the conditions, and the fact that Matt Hancock had the cheek to go to parliament and say black lives matter,&nbsp;while not giving a single practical proposal for saving black lives, shows that they don\u2019t care and they\u2019re deeply cynical.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Tulip </strong>Siddiq<strong>, </strong><strong>MP for Hampstead and Kilburn</strong><strong> and shadow minister for children and early years</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People are focusing on this one incident that\u2019s happening in America.

  "<p>Why did anyone really believe anyone other than Tim Davie would be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/bbc-appoints-insider-tim-davie-as-director-general\">next director general</a> of the BBC? Facing an existential crisis, buffeted by financial, political and cultural storms, the very British corporation was always likely to pick the privately educated white man who went to Oxbridge.</p> <p>And that was before confirmation that he was involved in his local Conservative Party in the 1990s. The current government, which misses no opportunity to accuse the BBC of leftwing bias, can surely hardly believe its luck than the new occupant was once one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Faced with a choice between Davie and the two other strong contenders \u2013 a woman with creative rather than editorial experience, the BBC\u2019s director of content, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S97L6pVTexI\">Charlotte Moore</a>, and a charismatic outsider, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a607e8bf-5604-4577-b94c-bea5fe7f3bd0\">William Lewis</a>, a media executive who has attracted more headlines in his career than the other two put together \u2013 a panel led by the BBC\u2019s chairman, David Clementi (Winchester, Oxford), went for Davie (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitgift_School\">Whitgift</a>, Cambridge; although he went to Whitgift on a scholarship, and was the first in his family to go to university).</p> <p>The frontrunner more or less from the moment Tony Hall announced his departure, Davie even had a trial run at the job in 2012, in the middle of the scandal over the way the BBC handled sexual abuse allegations. He is the very definition of a safe pair of hands.</p> <p>Despite 15 years at the BBC, including four months in the top job, he is credited with neither the sort of radical, visionary actions that create headlines nor (and perhaps more importantly) the pratfalls that so often get director generals into trouble.</p> <p>That he feels like a slightly uninspiring choice is perhaps because of the exigencies of the age: today\u2019s director general needs to be a financial whizz, journalistic rock and political street fighter.</p> <p>This is then not the column to ask why the BBC has spent 98 years being led by men, but rather what sort of BBC will mark its centenary. The corporation is always facing challenges of one kind or another, but rarely has its method of funding via a mandatory and universal licence fee seemed so at risk, nor its independence from a government seemingly hellbent on destroying it.</p> <p>Davie\u2019s background does not negate the fact that he has a smart commercial mind and is universally popular among his staff. He is generally so well regarded that few have a bad word to say against him. The fact he has become the ultimate BBC insider is a testament to the perseverance of this former marketing manager for PepsiCo, who for years had to endure the snootiness of a British media world that hated anyone focused on money. How times change.</p> <p>Now his financial experience \u2013 he will become the only director general to have worked in both an external and internal commercial role as well as editorial (four years running radio) \u2013 is likely to please a government looking at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/tv-licence-could-be-abolished-from-2027-says-nicky-morgan\">radical rethink of BBC funding</a>.</p> <p>Hall is leaving the job after seven years, not just without an obvious successor but with the BBC facing a financially constrained future. While the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/16/qa-how-the-bbc-is-funded-by-tv-licences\">licence fee settlement</a> he negotiated until 2022 provides more security than most are facing in the current moment, many of the most difficult decisions have simply been kicked into the long grass, where they lie in wait like snakes for his successor. Among them is what to do about the controversial decision to start charging the over-75s for their licence fee, a decision delayed until August because of lockdown.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s sterling performance during the outbreak of Covid-19 \u2013 from news to education (it even sourced ventilators from a soap opera to help the NHS) \u2013 may have helped with public support, but the overspending is <a href=\"https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/annualreport/2018-19.pdf\">estimated</a> to have cost a further \u00a3125m this year.</p> <p>The fact of public support is, however, the only way the BBC can truly fight a government that, even while fighting a disastrous battle against an invisible enemy, continued to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/03/bbc-stands-firm-against-ministers-criticism-panorama-show-ppe-coronavirus\">criticise the messenger, not the message.</a> At the height of lockdown the culture minister, Oliver Dowden, accused the BBC of political bias over a programme on the government\u2019s failure to provide enough personal protective equipment, not by refuting the central allegations but by an ad-hominem attack on the political affiliations of the NHS workers interviewed.</p> <p>Public support for the BBC may be high now but it is volatile, especially in a climate where doubts over<strong> </strong>veracity and impartiality are the norm.</p> <p>Today, Davie made a commitment to this impartiality in accepting the job. In welcoming the new director general, Dowden also lost no time in saying that he was encouraged by Davie\u2019s \u201ccommitment to impartiality at the BBC as well as the need for further reform\u201d.</p> <p>The closest Davie has come to scandal \u2013 the Radio 2 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/27/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-andrew-sachs-calls\">phone hoax</a> involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross and the (shelved) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/05/bbc-6-music-saved\">closure</a> of 6 Music \u2013 seem almost quaint next to the difficulties ahead, though editorial oversight and financial management are likely to be at the heart of those challenges. While Moore is expected to continue as a trusted head of content, it is in news output that Davie should look to shore up his credentials. Is there someone like Lewis, an award-winning journalist with huge management experience, internally?</p> <p>The independence of the BBC is at the core of every crisis it has ever faced, and Johnson\u2019s government has made no secret that the BBC is in its sights. Chairman David Clementi has <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/global/david-clementi-bbc-chairman-oliver-dowden-boris-johnson-exit-february-2021-1234626108/\">confirmed</a> that he will be departing early next year with the government understood to be keen to get its own man (or even, heaven forbid woman) in the job.</p> <p>An ultra-marathon runner, Davie has been underestimated before. He caused much harrumphing when he took over BBC radio from the revered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/10/bbc.radio\">Jenny Abramsky</a>, a 39-year BBC lifer. Yet he won so many plaudits for his tenure that he got to pretend to be DG for a few months afterwards. Now he gets to do it for real. We all need him to prove that he has both the vision and street smarts for the job.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>",

It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is to be done?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda. But the real solutions may not be top down but ...<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>... bottom up?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yes. Grassroots movements led the way on plastic bags, and have spawned others such as Refill, which emphasises reusing bottles, and A Plastic Planet, which urges plastic-free aisles in supermarkets. Popular culture remains hugely important: it's just possible that the British series The Blue Planet has changed attitudes overnight.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>An official for OG Plastic said it employed hundreds of people at its factory.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ministry aims to send a strong message to the public that plying in illegal plastics has no place in the country and if found, those involved will face the law,\u201d said Peter Magombo, principal environmental officer.</p> \n<p>Under the law, the companies could also be fined by the courts.</p> \n<p>More company inspections are expected to be carried out in the coming months.</p> \n<p>Mathews Malata, interim leader for the Movement for Environmental Action in Malawi, commended the government for its action, but said it needed to do more to enforce the ban throughout the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government is not walking the talk [because] since the ban, we haven\u2019t seen much [action] on the ground.

This must avoid diverting the efforts of those responding to the crisis or apportioning blame, but should propose feasible ways to overcome the obstacles faced by those on the frontline of the response and help them to save lives.</p> <p><strong>Dr JS Bamrah</strong> <em>Chairman, British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Raj Bhopal</strong> <em>Emeritus professor of public health</em><em>, Usher Institute,</em> <em>University of Edinburgh</em><br></p> <p><strong>Dr Kailash Chand</strong> <em>Former deputy chair,</em> <em>British Medical Association council</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Anthony Costello</strong> <em>Professor of</em> <em>global</em> <em>health, University College London; former director,</em> <em>World Health Organization; member of independent Sage committee</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Majid Ezzati</strong> <em>Chair in global environmental health,</em> <em>School of Public Health, Imperial College London</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Ilora Finlay</strong> <em>House of Lords</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Karl Friston</strong> <em>Computational modeller and neuroscientist,</em> <em>University College London, in charge of developing a generative SEIR (</em><em>susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) Covid-19 model; member of independent Sage committee</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Ruth Gilbert</strong> <em>Professor of clinical epidemiology, University College London</em><br></p> <p><strong>Dr Mike Gill</strong> <em>Former regional director of public health</em><br></p> <p><strong>Sir Ian Gilmore</strong> <em>Chair, Alcohol Health Alliance</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Mark S Gilthorpe</strong> <em>Professor of statistical epidemiology, University of Leeds; fellow,</em> <em>Alan Turing Institute</em><br></p> <p><strong>Dr Fiona Godlee</strong> <em>Editor-in-chief,</em> <em>The BMJ</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Trisha Greenhalgh</strong> <em>Professor of primary care, University of Oxford</em><br></p> <p><strong>Dr Katie Harron</strong> <em>UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health</em><br></p> <p><strong>Richard Horton</strong> <em>Editor-in-</em><em>chief,</em> <em>the Lancet</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof David McCoy</strong> <em>Queen Mary University of London</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Nuala McGrath</strong> <em>Professor of epidemiology and sexual health, and NIHR global health professor, University of Southampton</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Martin McKee</strong> <em>Professor of European public health, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Susan Michie</strong> <em>Director,</em> <em>Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London</em><em>; member of independent Sage committee</em><br></p> <p><strong>Dr Miriam Orcutt</strong> <em>Senior</em> <em>research</em> <em>fellow,</em> <em>Institute for Global Health, University College London</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Christina Pagel</strong> <em>Mathematician and professor of operational research,</em> <em>University College London; member of</em> <em>independent Sage committee</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Neil Pearce</strong> <em>Professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Deenan Pillay</strong> <em>Professor of virology, University College London; former member of Sage</em> <em>; member of</em> <em>independent Sage committee</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Allyson Pollock</strong> <em>Co-director,</em> <em>Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, Newcastle University; member of independent Sage committee</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Devi Sridhar</strong> <em>Professor and chair of global public health, University of Edinburgh</em><br></p> <p><strong>Prof Helen Ward</strong> <em>Professor of public health, Imperial College London</em><br></p> <p><strong>Dr Sarah Wollaston</strong> <em>Former chair,</em> <em>health and social care select committee; former MP for Totnes</em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>This letter was written as part of the <a href=\"https://www.marchforchange.uk/coronavirus_inquiry\">March for Change campaign</a> for an urgent public inquiry into the coronavirus crisis.</em></p>",

  "<p>High street retailers must give each shopper a minimum of 10 sq metres of space if they are to maintain social distancing rules, a new study has found, prompting businesses to complain that a lack of official guidance has left reopening plans in chaos.</p> <p>With 10 days to go until most non-essential shops reopen in England, a research paper <a href=\"https://www.highstreetstaskforce.org.uk/resources/details/?id=bc16b6bc-0ebb-4b7b-8df8-d8aa6b9a3a9f\">by Manchester Metropolitan and Cardiff universities</a> has concluded that larger shops must allow substantially more than a 2-metre distance for each person so that they can move freely.</p> <p>The study, which uses&nbsp;tessellated modelling&nbsp;- a combination of circles and squares to indicate available space \u2013 finds that people need 10 sq metres in smaller shops, 11 sq metres in larger shops, and 12 sq metres in outdoor spaces where they move more rapidly. That is up to three times as much space as the 4 sq metres needed around stationary people to maintain 2 metres of social distancing, according to the modelling.</p> <p>The expert analysis was produced because its authors say that the official advice on reopening fails to set out how to practically enforce the 2-metre distancing guidelines.</p> <p>Retailers say the report highlights the failure of the government to produce adequate advice for shops as they return to business. The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5eb9703de90e07082fa57ce0/working-safely-during-covid-19-shops-branches-v1.1-250520.pdf\">official advice</a> simply tells people to consider how many people can \u201creasonably\u201d fit and to \u201climit the number of customers in the store\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised we haven\u2019t got clear guidance that says how many people you can have in a shop of a certain size,\u201d said Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA). \u201cThat would create an equal footing in every shop. The risk is that you get a race to the bottom on a street. Consumers will be wary of shops that have no hard and fast policies.\u201d</p> <p>Large and small shops are scrambling to prepare for the reopening of the high street on 15 June, with businesses experimenting with measures from \u201cbrowsing by appointment\u201d to using floral designs for distance warning stickers because they are believed to be more reassuring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/coronavirus-lockdown-rules-what-is-allowed-in-england-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland\">Lockdown rules: what is allowed in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Goodacre said the difficulty of estimating how many shoppers would be in an average store \u2013 alongside complicating factors such as the fact that customers were more likely to buy something if they had been queuing \u2013 made it hard to predict the impact of social distancing on business.</p> <p>With an estimated 70% of pre-coronavirus trade needed to break even, Goodacre said retailers would \u201cbe lucky to see 30-40% of sales with this kind of capacity\u201d.</p> <p>The report\u2019s conclusions are based on the speed and unpredictability of people\u2019s movements, which means they are much more likely to get near each other when shopping than when queuing or sitting at a desk \u2013 and therefore require a bigger \u201chalo\u201d.</p> <p>Chris Turner, the chief executive of British BIDs \u2013 the representative group for Business Improvement Districts \u2013 said the report showed that maintaining a 2-metre distance was \u201chugely problematic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you do the sums, you find that a small cocktail bar can fit about two people in,\u201d he added. He warned that more planning needed to be done to prepare shared high street space, saying: \u201cRetailers are finding creative ways to deal with this 2-metre malarkey \u2013 but they can\u2019t afford to have them all queuing outside at the same time as it stands because if everybody does that it\u2019ll be chaos.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Cathy Parker, one of the report\u2019s authors, said that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to go from one place to another and see that the numbers are really different. Anything that\u2019s going to make people think the rules are being broken and it\u2019s a risky environment, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine to see everybody queuing up, that doesn\u2019t look like a risk,\u201d she added. \u201cBut telling people to keep 2 metres apart in shops where people are bunching \u2026 You can tell retailers to manage capacity but how do they work that out? None of it is visible in the government guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers are continuing to debate whether social distancing rules could be relaxed to 1 metre without risking a rapid rise in the coronavirus \u201cR\u201d rate that will determine whether the UK faces a second wave of infections.</p> <p>Some shops, pubs and restaurants are calling for a change to 1-metre distancing, in line with World Health Organization guidelines. The research found that such a reduction would mean that only about 5 to 6 sq metres would be needed per shopper.</p> <p>But while Turner said that for many hospitality businesses \u201cit will not be financially viable to reopen unless the distance is reduced from 2 metres\u201d and called for the minimum to be reviewed, he noted that the uncertainty over the final guidance risked \u201ctossing all the planning into disarray\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real sense that the government is making it up as it goes along,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u200b\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to clarify the type of modelling used in the study, and to remove a graphic which, \u200bwhile showing the correct figures, did not show the exact modelling used to arrive at these figures.</p>",

  "<p>When applications to be the BBC director general opened at the start of the year, it was seen by some potential candidates within the media industry as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/11/applications-bbc-top-job-director-general-close-media-figures-steer-clear\">something of a poisoned chalice</a>.</p> <p>The victorious candidate would inherit a sprawling broadcaster facing a hostile government intent on cutting it down to size, an organisation required to impose further financial cuts even as it struggled to compete in a global media marketplace, and a media business built on the principle of universal appeal trying to attract younger audiences who don\u2019t feel the same natural affinity to its services.</p> <p>Then the coronavirus pandemic happened, the commercial media industry took a financial hammering, and the BBC saw surging audience figures and growing public trust as people turned to the national broadcaster in a time of national crisis.</p> <p>All of the underlying problems remain but Tim Davie \u2013 a longterm BBC commercial executive who has never made a programme \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/bbc-appoints-insider-tim-davie-as-director-general\"> inherits an organisation</a> that has, by chance, earned a brief period of breathing space and a chance to reset its relationship with ministers.</p> <p>Davie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/tim-davie-bbc-director-general-ultrarunner-marketing-guru\">background in marketing</a> is often mentioned dismissively by journalists within the organisation, who note that before joining the BBC one of his most notable actions was helping to rebrand Pepsi\u2019s packaging to blue in the 1990s.</p> <p>What has rarely been noticed is his stint during the same era as the <a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/marketing-mix-true-blue-davie-no-euro-sceptic/63789\">deputy chairman of the Hammersmith and</a><a href=\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/marketing-mix-true-blue-davie-no-euro-sceptic/63789\"> Fulham Conservative party</a> \u2013 experience that could come in handy for what is an intensely political role.</p> <p>The first issue he will have to deal with is placating a government that, powered by the anti-media fury of the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, spent the start of the year proposing to cut the BBC down to size \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\"> boycotting key political programmes</a> and launching a still-ongoing consultation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/05/bbc-facing-funding-cut-as-licence-fee-consultation-launched\">decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee</a>.</p> <p>Since then the corporation has won plaudits from ministers for its provision of accurate health information and educational programming, with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, often effusive in his praise.</p> <p>But as the coronavirus infection rate starts to recede, so relations between ministers and the BBC have become increasingly strained. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/bbc-switches-emily-maitlis-in-newsnight-episode-over-cummings-remarks\">Emily Maitlis\u2019s monologue criticising Cummings on Newsnight</a> has not helped matters, with signs that the government is once again willing to confront the corporation\u2019s news arm.</p> <p>There is a growing acceptance that the concept of the licence fee being charged on possession of a television, currently guaranteed until 2027, is starting to appear outdated. Even the BBC is tentatively suggesting an eventual shift to a Scandinavian-style model where the public are directly taxed to support public service broadcasting. Davie \u2013 who specialised in raising funds for the BBC through non-licence-fee operations by selling formats around the world \u2013 will play a key role in shaping any new funding model, while also having to spend years imposing endless cuts.</p> <p>The BBC chairman, David Clementi, who led the appointment process, will also have been well aware that his own term on the corporation\u2019s board runs out at the start of 2021. He will have known that if the board appointed a leftfield candidate then, in less than a year, ministers could appoint a new BBC chairman with the instruction to sack the director general.</p> <p>Some of these political attacks are made possible by the shakiness of some of the audience figures for the corporation\u2019s output. In absolute terms, the BBC remains dominant in the British media world: its news website has far more readers than any other outlet, it still accounts for half of all radio listening, and the vast majority of the population use it in some way every week. But there is a small but growing number of people \u2013 mainly younger, more diverse audiences \u2013 who do not consume any BBC content, undermining the concept of a universal licence fee providing a universal service.</p> <p>Then there is the growing issue of trust in the corporation\u2019s news output, which remains high among the general population but is fraying around the edges, following years of criticism of apparent bias in its political output from both the left and right of politics.</p> <p>That\u2019s before taking into account the growing anger from many BBC staff, powered by their own social media channels, over the corporation\u2019s commitment to presenting different sides of the debate on issues such as race and LGBT rights. With the corporation increasingly finding itself in the middle of an ongoing culture war, it won\u2019t be long until Davie becomes embroiled in a row similar to the debate over<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/30/naga-munchetty-bbc-reverses-decision-to-censure-presenter\"> Naga Munchetty\u2019s comments on Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>But ultimately, as the man who will lead the BBC through its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2022, Davie\u2019s stint in charge will be judged on one thing alone: will he manage to ensure that when he steps down, the UK still has a financially sustainable public service broadcaster that enjoys the support of majority of the public?</p>",

The margin, 14 points, satisfied most pre-match prognostications and looks comfortable enough. But Souths were in the contest for much of the match and at several stages threatened to go on and win it. But a litany of errors, particularly in the second half, hurt the visitors badly. Conversely, the Storm were cleaner with the ball and boasted the man, Cameron Munster, whose silky skills were the difference between the sides.</p> <p>Souths are still seeking their first win in Melbourne but, more pertinently, a victory against anyone that can stop their 2020 campaign spiralling out of control. Melbourne weren\u2019t exceptional but they continue to win. Talk of their demise has been greatly exaggerated. Thanks for your company.

I find it difficult to know what Wayne Bennett\u2019s on about at the best of times. It\u2019s not just the laconic drawl or the sense of humour so dry it could soak up the Georges River. It\u2019s because I never know if he\u2019s being serious or just playing funny buggers. Love the supercoach and all he does but he\u2019s a cagey customer - and, to be fair, at his age he\u2019s allowed to be. The subplot to tonight\u2019s game is a case in point. Yes, premiership points are on the line. Yes, both teams are outside the eight hence both could do with a win. So there\u2019s plenty in it as it is. But no, the Souths coach has to stir the pot and muddy the waters with a dig in the ribs about the Melbourne being past their prime. And it\u2019s here where he gets in your head, whether you\u2019re Craig Bellamy, a Storm player, a knackered blogger or old Norm nestled in the armchair about to watch the game.

  "<p>Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor has ordered the immediate trial of a father on charges of forcing his three young daughters to undergo female genital mutilation (FGM), after he told them they were going to be vaccinated against coronavirus. The doctor involved will also go on trial.</p> <p>The procedure was banned in 2008 and criminalised in 2016.</p> <p>The man was reported to the authorities by his former wife, who said the girls were under 18. The unnamed doctor is accused of carrying out the procedure, which involves the removal of the outer layers of female genitalia and sometimes the clitoris.&nbsp;</p> <p>A statement from the public prosecutor said the girls were told they would be seeing a doctor to be vaccinated. Instead, they were injected with a sedative and awoke later to find they had forcibly undergone FGM.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite FGM being criminalised in Egypt for four years, few cases have made it to trial and just one doctor has served time in prison for performing the procedure.</p> <p>Yet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/female-genital-mutilation/\">according to Unicef</a>, 87% of women aged 15 to 49 have undergone FGM in Egypt, and about 14% of girls under 14 have been cut.</p> <p>Under Egypt\u2019s current laws,&nbsp;anyone who performs FGM faces between three and 15 years in prison, while anyone accompanying girls or women to be cut faces up to three years in jail. Campaigners&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/01/egypts-tougher-penalties-for-fgm-will-have-little-impact-say-rights-groups\">have long warned</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;the new&nbsp;legislation is unlikely to be effective due to a reliance on&nbsp;people to self-report.

A controversial reconciliation with the deceased girl\u2019s family led to the suspension of two years of his sentence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really shocking that authorities such as judges and the police continue to treat FGM cases with extreme leniency here. The sad reality is that most of them do not take cases seriously because they believe that it is for the benefit of the girl to undergo it to protect her chastity,\u201d&nbsp;said Reda el-Danbouki, executive director of the Women\u2019s Centre for Guidance and Legal Awareness.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen that even when a doctor is arrested such as earlier this year, he is set free almost immediately and a trial date is now in doubt. This gives the impression that doctors can continue to perform FGM with impunity,\u201d&nbsp;he said.<br></p>",

After passing the copy around, they conclude that \u201cpolitically, it was not a dangerous book\u201d. The censors have been less forgiving of Shokoofeh Azar\u2019s first novel for adults, which was banned in Iran, though many copies have been printed underground. It is now on the shortlist for the 2020 International Booker prize \u2013 a first for fiction translated from Farsi.</p> <p>As signalled by the nod to Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, the novel applies magic realism with a Persian twist to Iran after the Islamic revolution of 1979, focusing on one family destroyed by the upheaval. It opens in 1988 as a mother\u2019s grief-driven epiphany at the top of a \u201cgreengage plum tree\u201d coincides with the execution of her son, hanged without trial and dumped in a mass grave in the deserts south of Tehran \u2013 \u201cone of fifteen thousand people \u2026 killed for their political beliefs in the 1980s, alone\u201d. </p> <p>The youth\u2019s 13-year-old sister Bahar had burned to death in a cellar when zealots stormed the family home in Tehran \u2013 a mansion filled with Persian poetry, tar music and an \u201cuncensored\u201d library, from Rumi and Shakespeare to Sadegh Hedayat\u2019s modern classic <em>The Blind Owl</em>. It is ostensibly the dead girl\u2019s ghost who narrates how her bereaved parents, Reza and Hushang, her sister Beeta and brother Sohrab, sought \u201csanctuary and serenity\u201d in the ancient forests of Mazandaran in northern Iran. As four guards and a mullah pursue them, Sohrab is removed in handcuffs, Reza abandons their forest home, and Beeta, grappling with delusions, morphs into a mermaid in the Caspian sea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Azar deploys dreams and Persian folklore, from forest jinns to black snow, to mythologise a civilisation devouring itself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Footnotes proliferate: Azar deploys dreams and an encyclopaedic knowledge of Persian folklore, from forest jinns to black snow, to mythologise a revolution\u2019s decay and a civilisation devouring itself. The \u201cinsatiable\u201d eight-year Iran-Iraq war, stoked \u201cwith the flesh of child mine-sweepers\u201d, is poignantly evoked through \u201corphan mothers\u201d who bury their sons with the small golden bells that are tied around children\u2019s ankles \u201cso they wouldn\u2019t get lost\u201d. In a supernatural revenge fantasy, these ranks of cannon fodder join forces with the disappeared to vanquish the \u201cstonily arrogant\u201d Ayatollah Khomeini in his subterranean palace of mirrors, his corpse emitting the \u201csame stench that all dictators secrete in the end\u201d.</p> <p>Some playful prose, as when Reza and a blue-eyed Italian backpacker find themselves \u201chigh upon the enlightenment of love\u201d, suggests a Farsi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/isabelallende\">Isabel Allende</a>. But the main problem is an ill-conceived, and poorly controlled, teenage narrative (\u201cI was nothing but a delusional dead person\u201d) more reminiscent of magic realism\u2019s New Age spinoff \u2013 a cloying genre that went global in the 1990s with novels such as Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni\u2019s <em>The Mistress of Spices</em>. The plot itself suffers from blind alleys (an irrelevant treasure trunk); a premature climax (Khomeini\u2019s early nemesis); and a limp ending.</p> <p>The author, who sought political asylum in Australia in 2011, has said she wrote the novel primarily for western readers. But, despite a catalogue of appalling events, we learn surprisingly little of the history behind the revolution. The shah\u2019s Literacy Corps is mentioned, but not his secret police. In place of the historical forces at work in Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s fiction, we have national myth. Bahar\u2019s immolation is likened to the Arab conquest of Persia, when Islam ousted Zoroastrianism around the seventh century. The family persist in referring to this modern orgy of book burning and killing as \u201cthe Arab invasion\u201d: \u201cThey came and burnt, plundered, and killed. Just like 1,400 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The US-based translator, whose name the UK publishers have withheld \u201cfor reasons of safety and at the translator\u2019s request\u201d, has made a good job of sections. But, too often, it reads like a draft, tripping up the reader. Consider this description of a treehouse: \u201cIt had a window facing the sunrise and a door facing its setting\u201d \u2013 the sun\u2019s setting, that is. Or this: \u201cLife is precisely that which she and others were prodigiously killing \u2013 the moment itself.\u201d</p> <p>In the most convincing section, set decades after the revolution, the bereaved father passes morality police and chador-clad women in Tehran, feeling \u201calien in his own country\u201d. Detained, he writes a record of his life, investing desperate hope in the power of the imagination to transport him from the \u201cstale minds\u201d of his captors. Few would quarrel with such a sentiment. Yet to overlook the book\u2019s flaws risks what South African writers under apartheid, eager for a robust critical response to their art, memorably scorned as \u201csolidarity criticism\u201d. It would also be regrettable if the claims made for this ambitious but uneven novel deterred even a few readers from venturing further into Farsi literature.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree by Shokoofeh Azar, translated by Anonymous, is published by Europa Editions (RRP \u00a313.99).

Will we be getting a Friday surprise today as well?</p> \n  <p>Earlier, at the press conference, <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>was asked about free childcare, which the education minister, <strong>Dan Tehan</strong>, has signalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/19/its-done-its-job-dan-tehan-flags-end-of-free-childcare-under-weight-of-increasing-demand\">must come to an end as the economy reopens and more children return to care</a>.</p> \n  <p>Morrison said that centres \u201care keen to move back to a more normal arrangement\u201d and \u201cwe will be in a position in the not too distant future to make further announcements about that\u201d. So far \u2013 a pretty good candidate for the Friday surprise.</p> \n  <p>Then we spotted a <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00066\">legislative instrument</a>, registered on Friday, in which the education department secretary <strong>nominated 13 July as the date at which new rules on allowable absences from childcare will apply</strong>. The rules were due to apply from 21 September or a date to be fixed by the secretary.</p> \n  <p>Allowable absences are an integral part of the old subsidy model \u2013 they define reasons children can be absent that won\u2019t result in reduced subsidies to parents. They\u2019re less relevant under the temporary free system, as the government stopped caring about the whys and wherefores of children not attending care.</p> \n  <p>We can\u2019t be sure the 13 July date is when the free system will snap back to something resembling the old subsidy model. But it\u2019s a pretty big bread crumb in the trail.

But <strong>George Floyd</strong>\u2019s death has raised questions about whether Arradondo \u2014 or any chief \u2014 can fix the department. The city\u2019s own data going back to 2015 shows that when police officers use force, 60% of the time the person they\u2019re dealing with is black, though only 20% of the population is black.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the chief\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d <strong>City Council member Steve Fletcher</strong> said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this department was ever going to let him get there. I think people understand he was in an impossible situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Fletcher argues that Arradondo was too lenient with discipline in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made getting rid of problem officers difficult later.</p> \n  <p>Arradondo\u2019s predecessor, <strong>Janee Harteau</strong>, was forced out over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">the fatal shooting of <strong>Justine Ruszczyk Damond</strong></a>. She said she received push-back from the union when she was trying to implement reforms and this week she called on police union President Lt. <strong>Bob Kroll</strong> to resign after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">his controversial comments</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges related to Floyd\u2019s death and will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department to determine if it has engaged in discriminatory practices, <strong>Governor Tim Walz</strong> said this week.</p> \n  <p>Fletcher said he wants to examine whether the police department should be disbanded, saying he believes it\u2019s \u201cso broken it can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to rebuild from the ground up,\u201d said Fletcher, vice chair of the city\u2019s public safety committee. <br></p> \n  <p>Bob Bennett, an attorney who said he has sued the department \u201chundreds\u201d of times over police misconduct allegations, said Arradondo probably did the best he could, but the union has more sway than chiefs do over police conduct.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI know he wants to reform the department as much as anyone I\u2019ve ever met or seen,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHopefully this whole mess will bring about some change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9e4e68f0854eb54d99384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T06:35:07.864Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far\u2026</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.

Bail would be lowered to $750,000 if they agreed to certain conditions, including forfeiting any personal firearms</p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death, which happened on Memorial Day, 25 May. Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also compared Trump\u2019s behaviour to Nazi propaganda and called the president\u2019s stunt on Monday, ordering the gassing of peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op outside St John\u2019s church, an \u201c<strong>abuse of executive authority</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268347256748507136\">tweeted</a> back: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost as inevitable as the abuse was the fact that the tweet contained a lie.

He did not ask for his resignation. <strong>The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused</strong>. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then he got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Unlike Mattis, Kelly has spoken out about Trump before, backing impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and expressing quite wide disagreement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/ex-white-house-chief-staff-john-kelly-speaks-out-against-trump\">Asked in February</a> why he went to work for Trump in 2017, Kelly said he had been \u201cfascinated \u2013 not necessarily in a good way \u2013 but fascinated as to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">that election</a> meant to our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Kelly and Mattis have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/john-kelly-donald-trump-cliff-sims-book\">widely reported</a> to have been \u201cadults in the room\u201d in the first years of the Trump White House, willing to stand up to the president and obstruct his more dangerous impulses.

Thousands are expected. But in South Australia an exemption to crowd limits was granted, which will allow the protest to go ahead.</p> \n<h2>Backlash against homebuilder scheme spreads to government backbench</h2> \n<p>The government\u2019s $688m pledge on Thursday to offer grants for home improvements and building projects was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/coalition-governments-homebuilder-grants-for-renovations-and-building-criticised-by-economists-and-backbench-mps\">panned by the IPA, as well as some Coalition MPs</a>, who warned it was a waste of money.</p> \n<p>It followed a frosty reception on Thursday from most experts about the design of the scheme, which requires a single person to earn less than $125,000 a year or a couple to make less than $200,000. Matt Canavan and Barnaby Joyce were among the MPs who raised concerns on Friday.</p> \n<p>While the PM has said the scheme is not negotiable, backbenchers are lobbying the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, to make sure the program does not extend beyond December.</p> \n<h2>Covid scheme providing food to older Australians fails to deliver</h2> \n<p>A government scheme to deliver a predicted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/05/government-scheme-delivers-just-38-of-predicted-36000-covid-food-boxes-to-older-australians\">36,000 Covid food boxes to older people has fallen well short of that target</a>.

The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce said clinicians could start using the drug to treat adults who had moderate, severe or critical cases of Covid-19. It would help aid recovery times.

Then after a short break, a two-month Test window would be played. </p> <p>By resuming in August, the latter rounds of the Premiership, including the play-offs, will clash with international weekends but the issue for clubs is less who will be playing for them than that they are playing again having been inactive since March. One or two grounds will be used for all the matches which, under current government regulations, will be played behind closed doors.</p> <p>&nbsp;\u201cNothing will happen until it is safe to do so but we will do everything we can to resume the campaign on 15 August,\u201d said the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Darren Childs. \u201cWe won\u2019t take risks with people\u2019s health, and rugby has unique challenges due to levels of proximity and impact, but with a number of clubs moving to Stage 1 training, it is important for us to give players, coaches and clubs clarity on when they can look to return.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lockdown has exposed the financial weakness of a league that has cumulative losses of \u00a350m.

  "<p>My mother, Saroj Lal, who has died aged 82, was a pioneering force in Scottish race relations during the 1970s, 80s and 90s. A feminist and trailblazer for equal opportunities, as director of Lothian Racial Equality Council (LREC) she was at the forefront of race relations during a period of immense political and social change. Always impeccably dressed in her trademark sari, she rose to the challenge with verve and determination.</p> <p>Never afraid to challenge the establishment, in her role with LREC she worked with public and third sector agencies \u2013 including the Home Office, NHS and police \u2013 to champion the rights of the disadvantaged and the voiceless. In 1986 she was the first Asian woman in \u00adScotland to be appointed as a justice of the peace.</p> <p>Saroj was born in Gujranwala (then in British India), daughter of Behari Lal Chanana, a businessman and Congress party politician, and his wife, Wazir Devi Khurana, who died when Saroj was very young. Her early years were marked by the turmoil of partition.</p> <p>She attended Kanya Maha Vidyalaya school, Jalandhar, and in<strong> </strong>1962 graduated with an MA in economics from Panjab University in Chandigarh. She taught briefly before her marriage to Amrit Lal, an engineer. The couple migrated to Edinburgh in the late 1960s, where Saroj combined raising a young family with furthering her education. She trained as a teacher at Moray House College of Education,<strong> </strong>and then taught at South Morningside primary school from 1970 to 1973. That year she began volunteering with the YWCA, which led to her becoming a community worker with the Roundabout International Centre. In 1980 she moved to LREC, becoming its director in 1990.</p> <p>Working with Lothian and Borders police, Saroj helped to draw up a working definition of racist attacks, to introduce regular monitoring of racist incidents, and to increase the profile of black and minority ethnic communities within the police force. At the time this was a predominantly a male world and an often sexist environment. It didn\u2019t stop her.</p> <p>Saroj worked hard to improve all aspects of life in Edinburgh\u2019s minority ethnic communities. She set up a continuation course at Telford College to persuade more Asian girls to pursue higher education. She secured funding \u2013 first from Comic Relief and then from Lothian regional council \u2013 for Milan, a support group for older people from south Asia. She led the early development of the Edinburgh Hindu temple, and set up the city\u2019s first interpreting and translating service for the local authority.</p> <p>After retiring in 1996, Saroj returned to teaching as a supply teacher in primary schools, was chair of Nari Kallyan Shangho, a project designed to offer support to south Asian women, and she continued to be an active member of Edinburgh Hindu temple.</p> <p>Saroj is survived by Amrit, their children, Kavita and me, and by their granddaughter, Isha.</p>",

I actually walked off the job because of being in a hostile work environment,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Harteau said she had another female officer as her patrol partner and male police officers would fail to back them up when called and cut their radio transmissions. She sued the department and won.</p> <p>Before Rybak became mayor he had been a journalist on the city\u2019s newspaper, the Star Tribune. \u201cI started off as a reporter covering police officers bashing into gay bathhouses and humiliating residents,\u201d he said.</p> <p>As mayor he was determined to do something about the culture of homophobia. Rybak appointed Harteau as police chief. That alone sent a message. He said she changed the culture of the city\u2019s police department to one of the most gay friendly in the country.</p> <p>The appointment of an African American chief to succeed Harteau in 2017 was a sign of progress on race. But in recent years the push to change the culture has been complicated by the increased militarisation of the police across the country.<br>Rybak said that after 9/11 there was \u201can open federal check book\u201d as homeland security turned police forces into security agencies, and to buy powerful weapons and surplus military equipment from the US army after it pulled out of Iraq. </p> <p>Harteau said that the circumstances of Floyd\u2019s death led her to question what she had been able to achieve as police chief.</p> <p>\u201cI would say my administration probably with 100 percent certainty made more proactive progressive changes than any other administration yet this incident still occurred, which makes me really question everything I thought I knew,\u201d she said.<br></p>",

  "<p>So now we have not one global crisis but three. Minneapolis, Covid-19, Hong Kong \u2013 race, health, geopolitics. How do you find the hope in that lot?</p> <p>My response, when people ask why the news is always so hopeless, is to make three points. First, it is important to remember that things are newsworthy because they are outliers, extreme moments, exceptions to the rule, the rule being that most people often lead unremarkable, gentle, agreeable lives.</p> <p>Second, the grimness of news helps society correct course. Revelations of scandal may result in prosecution; expos\u00e9s of incompetence lead to better performance. Campaigns about wrongdoing enable us to see the faults and fix them.</p> <p>Third, these swirling times of foment and despair often produce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/we-built-this-country-inspiring-moments-from-the-george-floyd-protests-video\">dynamics from which better things can surely come</a>. A global movement demanding fairer treatment of minorities may actually do something to advance that cause.

  "<p>Lewis Hamilton has always been a man apart. The higher he rises in the highest form of auto racing, the lonelier it gets at the top. Before the coronavirus put life as we\u2019d come to know it on pause, right as the Formula One season was revving up for a mid-March kickoff, the ace Mercedes pilot stood on the brink of statistical immortality, merely eight victories and a world championship shy of becoming the greatest to ever do it. That the 35-year-old Briton also happened to be born to a Caucasian mother and a black father makes his singular status in this lily white game at once a breakthrough and a burden. And a brother can only bear a weight that heavy for so long before his legs go all wobbly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/f1-drivers-respond-to-lewis-hamiltons-call-to-condemn-racism-george-floyd\">F1 drivers respond to Lewis Hamilton's call to condemn racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite 13 seasons of unrelenting strain, it wasn\u2019t until the recent tsunami of Black Lives Matter demonstrations that Hamilton ultimately reached his buckling point. As protests broke out across the globe in the wake of the bestial killing of George Floyd at the hands of four depraved Minneapolis police officers, Hamilton has not been bashful of endorsing the movement, or castigating his sport for steering clear of this subject altogether. \u201cI see those of you staying silent,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/f1-drivers-respond-to-lewis-hamiltons-call-to-condemn-racism-george-floyd\">wrote on Instagram</a>, \u201csome of you the biggest stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice.\u201d</p> <p>Given the wide array of sports figures that have engaged in the broader conversation around racial inequality since Floyd\u2019s brutal murder, from Michael Jordan to Tiger Woods, doubtless some will be seduced into thinking that Hamilton is just hopping on the bandwagon \u2013 or worse: doing it for clout. But the unimpeachable truth is, Hamilton has kept this same energy his whole career. Where Woods runs from race, famously describing himself as \u201cCablinasian\u201d, Hamilton is unequivocal. \u201cI don\u2019t wrestle with race at all; I\u2019m black,\u201d Hamilton told me when <a href=\"https://www.si.com/racing/2015/10/29/lewis-hamilton-formula-one-champion\">I profiled him for Sports Illustrated</a> during the 2015 United States Grand Prix. \u201cWhen I arrive here, I don\u2019t feel different, but I know I am different.\u201d Where Jordan famously \u201cjoked\u201d that \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too\u201d as explanation for not publicly supporting a black mayor\u2019s historic Senate campaign in his home state of North Carolina, Hamilton never drives his Merc out of the paddock without first slipping on an outsize, over-colored helmet with the phrase \u201cStill I Rise\u201d scrawled on the back. I wondered, Was that a Maya Angelou shoutout? \u201cNah, bruv,\u201d he quipped, flashing that trademark gapped-tooth smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s Tupac.\u201d</p> <p>Where another black exemplar in a majority white stratum might be content to play the role of the prized token, Hamilton bucks any label that would cast his presence in F1 alone as change enough. He\u2019s too talented and too indispensable to the sport to be shouted down or cast out altogether. For nearly his entire career, Hamilton has been calling on F1 to become more racially, culturally and gender inclusive that it\u2019s a wonder his voice hasn\u2019t totally abandoned him. It\u2019s a theme he touched on again in his extended Instagram post. \u201cNot a sign from anybody in my industry, which of course is a white-dominated sport,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am one of the only people of color there yet I stand alone I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can\u2019t stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are, and I see you.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For me, the post brought back memories of a news conference during that \u201915 USGP, when another black reporter lobbed Hamilton a question about getting more black Americans into F1. (\u201cDon\u2019t ask me,\u201d Hamilton cracked, gesturing at the white drivers with him on the dais. \u201cAsk these guys first! I\u2019d love to hear what others think!\u201d) For as funny and awkward as that moment was, this time Hamilton made no effort to couch his frustrations. His dramatic shift in tone was enough to turn the nervous tittering that F1 drivers always produce when put on the spot into actually taking a stand this week. \u201cTo be completely honest, I felt out of place and uncomfortable sharing my thoughts,\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc tweeted. \u201cAnd I was completely wrong.\u201d McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris disseminated a Black Lives Matter engagement link. \u201cThis time,\u201d he wrote to his 427,000 Twitter followers, \u201cI ask you to do something and take action.\u201d Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo was even more forceful, unpacking his thoughts underneath an Instagram mural that read: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b6408b116a5732d16d7feb17de92426ee408670\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b6408b116a5732d16d7feb17de92426ee408670/0_207_4403_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamilton sports a helmet with the phrase \u201cStill I Rise\u201d stenciled on the back, a nod not to Maya Angelou but to Tupac Shakur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The online chatter, whatever you make of it, might well be the most intense conversation about race that has ever bubbled up from within F1. Why it took until now to broach the subject isn\u2019t a mystery. It\u2019s history. The idea of a \u201cGrand Prize\u201d race owes its early momentum to young black chain gang workers in Savannah, Georgia, who were beaten and tortured and kept in makeshift slavery while hand carving and paving a 25-mile swath of dense wood and marshland for the inaugural showcase in 1908. Ferrari, the only F1 team that has been in the sport since its official inception in 1950, began as a plane engine builder for the fascist regime and proved so clutch that Benito Mussolini bestowed founder Enzo with the title of \u201cIl Commendatore\u201d \u2013 a title that became his nickname.</p> <p>Hamilton\u2019s own team, Mercedes, which not only reaped massive profits off the backs of 40,000 forced laborers during the Third Reich but also furnished Adolf Hitler\u2019s official coaches, was no better. Max Mosley, the barrister turned racing driver who presided over the governing body that oversaw F1 through boom times in the \u201990s and early aughts, is the younger son of 1930s fascist Sir Oswald Mosley and the socialite Diana Mitford; their secret wedding in October 1936 was held at the home of Joseph Goebbels and counted Hitler himself among the honored guests. From Michelin <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/contrarian/belgiums-heart-darkness\">rubber</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-28/shell-tries-to-come-clean-on-its-dirty-past-in-nigeria\">Shell gasoline</a>, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to name a feature of the modern Formula 1 spectacle that wasn\u2019t built on the complete subjugation and outright plundering of black and brown peoples. That the stars of the sport are now finally acknowledging their white supremacy is nice. But their sharp words alone won\u2019t be enough to cut into a 70-year head start.</p> <p>If the F1 is indeed serious about righting the scales of justice, the series could mandate that teams set aside a material chunk of their hundred-million dollar R&amp;D budgets to be invested in STEM programs that would provide non-white students onramps into the sport as engineers or aerodynamicists. John Malone and Greg Maffei, F1\u2019s American bosses and two of the biggest contributors to Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, would not only reinvest their fortunes in black communities that could extend the sport\u2019s reach, but also reserve extreme prejudice for the law enforcement types they pay handsomely to secure races. They\u2019d scrap plans for Grand Prix in Saudi Arabia and work on putting a Grand Prix in Ghana or Nigeria instead. Sure, most if not all of these broad proposals are likely to be met with some kind of resistance. But it pales in comparison to the kind of resistance that a black man could encounter if he\u2019s unfortunate enough to be pulled over while piloting&nbsp;their own Ferrari or a Mercedes SUV similar to the one George Floyd drove on the day of his unlawful demise.</p> <p>Whatever direction the sport takes on this new course, we can rest assured knowing that Hamilton is there to lead the way. What\u2019s more, he should draw a large measure of encouragement from having carried the global justice movement to a major turning point. Now when Hamilton decries what Martin Luther King would call \u201cthe silence of our friends\u201d, when Hamilton says, \u201cI see you\u201d, it isn\u2019t just F1\u2019s leading lights who hear him and shudder. We all do, and thus share responsibility with Hamilton, a true world champion, to hold these new allies and any more who come after them to their words.</p>",

In 2015, prosecutors began legal actions to force the state to protect the park.</p> <p>The Greenpeace report cites three farms in Sierra Ricardo Franco \u2013 Pared\u00e3o I, Pared\u00e3o II and Cachoeira \u2013 that prosecutors say were cleared after the park was created. Thousands of hectares were illegally deforested.</p> <p>The Cachoeira and Pared\u00e3o farms are co-owned by Marcos Tozzatti and a company he controls. Cachoeira and one of the Pared\u00e3o farms are also part-owned by a company where Eliseu Padilha \u2013 a former cabinet minister \u2013 is a partner. Tozzatti has been charged with environmental crimes including clearing hundreds of hectares of forest on Pared\u00e3o. After being ordered to cease agricultural activity, he more than doubled the size of his herd.&nbsp;</p> <p>He and other farmers inside the park have challenged its protected status and have won a court ruling allowing them to continue operations until a final decision is taken \u2013 but prosecutors are appealing the ruling. \u201cIn the prosecutors\u2019 office view, any deforestation inside the area is illegal,\u201d Costa said.</p> <p>The lawyer representing Tozzatti and Padilha did not respond to emailed questions.</p> <p>Greenpeace found that the Pared\u00e3o farms sent 4,000 cattle to the Barra Mansa farm outside the park, which is also registered to Tozzatti, between April 2018 and June 2019. In 2018 and 2019, the JBS, Minerva and Marfrig plants near the park bought thousands of head of cattle from the Barra Mansa farm. The JBS and Minerva plants exported nearly 50,000 tons of beef products, some of which went to European countries including the UK, the report found. Marfrig exported around 5,000 tons to countries including Hong Kong and Egypt.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s meat giants say they struggle to monitor so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/02/revealed-amazon-deforestation-driven-global-greed-meat-brazil\">indirect suppliers</a>\u201d \u2013 farms that sell cattle to other farms which are then sold on to their slaughterhouses \u2013 despite promising to do so in agreements signed in 2009 with federal prosecutors and Greenpeace.

The company said Barra Mansa was JBS-compliant for the period cited in the report.</p> <p>From 1 July, JBS will bring in a new \u201ctheoretical index\u201d which uses a farm\u2019s productivity to calculate if it is suspected of cattle laundering, and now checks supplier farms against areas embargoed by Brazil\u2019s federal environment agency, Ibama, using geomonitoring. \u201cThese innovations are expected to make a significant impact in reducing cases of cattle laundering across the beef industry,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Marfrig said that the Barra Mansa farm was a registered supplier and that from July 2018 to July 2019 its plant had slaughtered 180 cattle Tozzatti supplied. \u201cMarfrig is aware there is a challenge to be faced in obtaining information on these indirect suppliers,\u201d it said in a statement, highlighting its RFI (request for information) system under which farmers supply information on their suppliers.</p> <p>Last year Marfrig said&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/10/revealed-fires-three-times-more-common-in-amazon-beef-farming-zones\">53% </a>&nbsp;of its Amazon cattle came from indirect suppliers. JBS has refused to reveal its share. Minerva said its Amazon cattle purchases were \u201c100 percent made in monitored farms\u201d but that it was not possible to fully track Amazon cattle movements without full access to government data which it does not have.&nbsp;A Minerva spokeswoman said the company did not know how much of its Amazon cattle came via indirect suppliers. The company said the Pared\u00e3o farm has been blocked since 2018 but that Barra Mansa is a registered supplier. \u201cWe will investigate the facts with the legally available data,\u201d it said.&nbsp;</p>",

The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s<strong> </strong>the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.</p> <p>As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections.

Other companies include carmakers Honda, Nissan and Toyota, borrowing more than \u00a31bn among them, alongside engine-maker Rolls-Royce, which is taking a \u00a3300m bailout. Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, both oilfield services companies, are taking \u00a3600m and \u00a3150m respectively.</p> <p>Campaigners said the government must attach new conditions to the support it is giving, which could top \u00a367bn. Companies have so far borrowed more than \u00a316bn in total.</p> <p>\u201cIn return for assistance on such generous terms, we the public can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">demand better</a>,\u201d said Fran Boait, executive director of the pressure group Positive Money. \u201cWe really need to ask whether we should be propping up climate criminals and bad bosses with public money. The government must consider whether conditions which would stop firms laying off workers, avoiding tax and fuelling the climate crisis should be applied to these bailouts.\u201d</p> <p>Fiona Nicholls, climate campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the government was letting down the public and going against its claims that the recovery would be green. \u201cAirlines have been given exactly what the chancellor, the prime minister, economists and the public said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">they should not be given</a> \u2013 billions in cheap and easy loans to keep them polluting, without any commitments to reduce their emissions or even keep their workers on the payroll.\u201d</p> <p>The prime minister has given assurances that the recovery would be \u201csustainable\u201d, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is said to be planning a push for green jobs.

The National Trust charity has also benefited, with \u00a330m in help.</p> <p>The Guardian understands the Bank of England could in future change the terms of its lending to the companies involved, having already made minor changes to the terms before now. Future changes that would be technically possible include asking companies to sign up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/08/corporations-told-to-draw-up-climate-rules-or-have-them-imposed\">disclose their exposure to the risks from the climate emergency</a>, in line with the guidance endorsed by the Bank\u2019s previous governor, Mark Carney.</p> <p>Disclosing companies\u2019 risks from the climate crisis is a key tool in forcing investors to change their habits to boost the green economy.</p> <p>The Bank has not yet disclosed any analysis of the carbon intensity of the companies that have taken up the government funding available.</p> <p>The CCFF requires the Bank to buy up short-term debt from the companies, using public money and underwritten by the Treasury. The scheme was launched in March and is geared towards short-term help for the companies, for the next few months to a year.</p> <p>Some of the companies taking public backing have also announced job cuts, campaigners pointed out. For instance, EasyJet plans to cut up to 30% of its workforce and British Airways plans 12,000 job cuts despite receiving taxpayer support.</p> <p>The government\u2019s statutory advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/06/uks-coronavirus-recovery-should-have-green-focus-johnson-urged\">recommended a green recovery</a>, setting out potential job creation measures from insulating houses to planting trees and restoring peatland. A recent Oxford study found that a green recovery would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/green-stimulus-can-repair-global-economy-and-climate-study-says\">create higher returns and more jobs in the short and long term than a return to business as usual</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe government has rightly supported companies through the pandemic to protect jobs and livelihoods, but we should now expect these companies to contribute more to addressing the climate and nature crisis,\u201d said Jo Furtado, of the Green Alliance thinktank. \u201c This could be through more investment in green innovation or by reducing emissions to help us reach net zero.\u201d</p> <p>Boait invoked the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/heed-lessons-of-2008-crisis-experts-warn-global-leaders\"> recovery from the financial crisis more than a decade</a> ago: \u201cWe can\u2019t repeat the mistakes of 2008, where the banks got bailed out with no strings attached and the public got sold out.

  "<p>In late 2018 two far-right figures meet in a Rome hotel. The first is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2016/dec/19/trump-putin-same-side-new-world-order\">Alexander Dugin</a>, a Russian philosopher. With his long wispy beard, Dugin looks as if he might have fallen from the pages of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\">Crime and Punishment</a></em>. The second is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/steve-bannon-working-class-republicans-labour\">Steve Bannon</a>, former adviser to Donald Trump and an unashamed nationalist.</p> <p>The pair speak for eight hours. On the face of it they have much in common. Both are leading exponents of radical anti-liberal thinking who serve powerful masters. The list of mutual dislikes is long: globalism, international institutions, universal human rights. Neither is exactly a fan of immigration. Their vision is a world of sovereign and culturally specific nation states. It has a religious element, too, with lots of talk about the \u201cJudeo-Christian west\u201d. Bannon has repeatedly mooted an alliance between the US and Russia, seeing both states as natural partners in the struggle against godless cosmopolitanism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s never entirely clear if Teitelbaum shares his subjects\u2019 extreme views or regards them as ethnographic curiosities</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>According to the US scholar Benjamin Teitelbaum the Russian-American duo share another hidden bond. Both follow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_School\">traditionalism</a>, a 20th-century philosophical and spiritual school. It was once obscure, Teitelbaum writes, but it now has an outsize influence on far-right politics, and Dugin and Bannon have avidly studied its texts.</p> <p>Traditionalism\u2019s two leading lights are little known. One is Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, a French convert to Islam who wrote that history moves in cycles. The other is Julius Evola, an Italian baron and fascist. The pair\u2019s ideas form what Teitelbaum describes as \u201cDungeons &amp; Dragons for racists\u201d. Their creed is defiantly anti-modern and anti-Enlightenment. It favours the spiritual, the symbolic and the occult. Traditionalists see destruction as a precursor to a golden age. Oh, and according to Evola, Aryans are descended from ghostly, ethereal beings who lived in the Arctic.</p> <p>This all sounds crackpot, until you contemplate Trump\u2019s tearing down of the US administrative state. Environmental Protection Agency, State Department, Education Department: all were handed over to people who had vowed to wreck them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34ad143c681613f01c219582b400c74e497c0b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34ad143c681613f01c219582b400c74e497c0b17/0_30_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018An outreach person to white nationalists abroad.\u2019 Alexander Dugin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An outreach person to white nationalists abroad\u2019 \u2026 Alexander Dugin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sputnik/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>War for Eternity</em> joins the dots between this newly influential philosophy and leading personalities from the global right. In 2018-9 Teitelbaum spent 20 hours talking to Bannon. He spoke to Dugin and met with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/28/turf-war-breaks-between-bolsonaro-sons-and-brazil-vice-president\">Olavo de Carvalho</a>, a one-time journalist and astrologer who advises Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro.</p> <p>Bannon comes across as an erratic interviewee. Asked how he discovered traditionalism, the great guru replies: \u201cI\u2019m just some fuckin\u2019 guy, making it up as I go along.\u201d Trump\u2019s notorious aide is sometimes bored by philosophical questions, and glances at his phone. The author thinks nonetheless that Bannon\u2019s musings amount to a \u201ccoherent system of thought\u201d.</p> <p>The book is good on Bannon but weak on Dugin and Russian politics. Dugin is the leading proponent of Eurasianism, a doctrine that sees Russia as the centre of a rival empire to the Atlanticist west. Boiled down, his ideas are Russian-flavoured fascism. Dugin \u201cinspired\u201d Vladimir Putin, Teitelbaum says. In reality the Kremlin promoted Dugin because his Moscow-centred pseudo theories sit well with Putin\u2019s own project to remake Russia as a great power. This mission has nothing to do with Evola or Gu\u00e9non. It belongs to the KGB (now called the FSB). </p> <p>Over two decades the Kremlin has experimented with various ideologies as a way of rationalising its imperial ambitions. Putin\u2019s current favoured political vector is the far right. The Russian president\u2019s funding of anti-establishment parties across Europe is part of a strategy to sabotage western democracy. Dugin plays a licensed role in this, as outreach person to white nationalists and other allies abroad.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/lockdown-groups-far-right-links-coronavirus-protests-american-revolution\">Revealed: major anti-lockdown group's links to America's far right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At times I found <em>War for Eternity</em> infuriating. Teitelbaum refers to Bannon chummily as \u201cSteve\u201d and seems more than a little starstruck. It\u2019s never entirely clear if Teitelbaum shares his subjects\u2019 extreme views or simply regards them as ethnographic curiosities. There is a dinner with \u201cSteve\u201d and other far-right luminaries. We learn that Bannon tells his visitors to ask for Obi-Wan Kenobi at hotel receptions when coming to see him. </p> <p>Teitelbaum says little about the consequences of having Trump, Bolsonaro and others of their ilk in power. Their contempt for science, reason, facts, institutions and professional experts has been on show for a while now. These prejudices \u2013 dressed up as philosophy \u2013 have never seemed less suited to the moment.

  "<p>We are currently in the midst of the most severe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/uk-economy-set-for-slow-rebound-from-unprecedented-slump\">macroeconomic shock</a> since the second world war. The disruption to our daily lives and subsequent impact on our economies has been enormous. We are seeing first-hand that a collective response is needed to defeat a common enemy, as authorities across the world courageously mobilise all available resources to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>This crisis offers us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rebuild our economy in order to withstand the next shock coming our way: climate breakdown. Unless we act now, the climate crisis will be tomorrow\u2019s central scenario and, unlike Covid-19, no one will be able to self-isolate from it.</p> <p>In the immediate response to the pandemic,&nbsp;governments have taken measures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">unprecedented scale</a> to keep economic and financial systems afloat. The IMF estimates that approximately <a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2020/05/20/tracking-the-9-trillion-global-fiscal-support-to-fight-covid-19/\">$9</a><a href=\"https://blogs.imf.org/2020/05/20/tracking-the-9-trillion-global-fiscal-support-to-fight-covid-19/\">tn of fiscal support</a> has been provided across the world. This is necessary to limit acute and permanent damage. But as we consider the next stage of recovery, we must look beyond the immediate crisis and think more strategically about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;we do it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Collectively, countries around the globe are still far from meeting climate crisis goals, most notably the Paris agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/31/paris-climate-deal-2c-warming-study\">to&nbsp;limit</a> the increase in global temperature to well below 2C, and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C.<strong> </strong>Over the last year, we have seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/25/europe-heatwave-paris-forecast-record-hottest-ever-day\">record temperatures across Europe</a>, extreme rainfall in the US and <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2019-concludes-decade-of-exceptional-global-heat-and-high-impact-weather\">wildfires in the Arctic</a>. The effects of the climate crisis are irreversible, so the severity and frequency of these extreme weather events will only increase \u2013 by how much depends on our success in transitioning to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/we-must-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-net-zero-or-face-more-floods\">net-zero emission world</a>. Recognising this risk, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) \u2013 a coalition of 66 central banks, and supervisors \u2013 has been working to \u201cgreen\u201d the financial system to reduce the costly financial risks that these developments create.</p> <p>Acting early will help to smooth the transition and avoid a sharp and disorderly adjustment. To meet the goals of the Paris agreement requires a whole economy transition: every business, bank and financial institution will need to adapt. The pandemic has shown that we can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/office-life-furloughing-coronavirus\">change our ways of working</a>, living and travelling, but it has also shown that making these adjustments at the height of a crisis brings enormous costs.&nbsp;To address climate breakdown, we can instead take decisions now that reduce emissions in a less disruptive manner.&nbsp;That requires us to be strategic. To build back better.</p> <p>This will only happen if financial decisions, including those made by businesses, investors, banks and governments, take the climate crisis into account.<strong> </strong>The economic recovery plans being developed today offer the chance to build a sustainable, competitive new economy. </p> <p>Following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/28/markets-credit-crunch-banking-2008\">global financial crisis</a>, only a fraction of fiscal spending improved sustainability. This time, governments\u2019 stimulus packages can be more ambitious; for example, some are already accelerating the transition to clean energy, retrofitting homes and buildings, and linking financial support to climate-related conditions laid out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/renewable-energy-investors-increasingly-look-to-uk-says-report\">Investments in renewable energy</a> infrastructure could also serve a dual purpose, moving us towards an orderly transition path and creating jobs to <a href=\"https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/wpapers/workingpaper20-02.pdf\">support the recovery</a>.</p> <p>Recognising the continued importance of climate risks to the financial sector, the NGFS has continued its work while those on the frontline fight the pandemic.&nbsp;As central banks and supervisors, we must use our financial stability mandates and expertise to ensure climate risks are effectively managed in the financial system.</p> <p>The challenge is global and will benefit from early action, so we are working together to share best practice and build our capabilities. Last week, the NGFS released a <a href=\"https://www.ngfs.net/en/liste-chronologique/ngfs-publications\">package of reports</a> on climate and environmental risks, including an overview of industry practices and guidance for supervisory authorities, and in the coming weeks it will publish a set of climate reference scenarios. This work will support an orderly transition and raise the bar for the financial sector worldwide.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the financial crisis the international community rallied together to reform the financial system. These reforms have enabled the financial system to be part of the solution rather than the problem. Once again we have reached a fork in the road. We have a choice: rebuild the old economy, locking in temperature increases of 4C with extreme climate disruption; or build back better, preserving our planet for generations to come.</p> <p>To meet the climate crisis challenge, we must learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us make a green recovery the first step down that road.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Bailey is&nbsp;governor of the Bank of England; Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau is governor of Banque de France; Frank Elderson is chair of the Network for Greening the Financial System and executive board member of the Nederlandsche Bank; Mark Carney is UN special envoy for climate action and finance</p>",
  "<p>The coronavirus pandemic is an \u201cSOS signal for the human enterprise\u201d, according to a leading economist and the United Nation\u2019s environment chief, who warn that current economic thinking does not recognise that human wealth depends on nature\u2019s health.</p> <p>\u201cThe language of economics is failing us [and] the result is that we miss the message,\u201d said Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta and the UN\u2019s Inger Andersen in an <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/biodiversity-economy-coronavirus-covid-19-dasgupta-review-a9550156.html#gsc.tab=0\">article published on Friday</a>. \u201cOur economies, livelihoods and wellbeing all rely on nature, from the food we eat, to controlling our climate, regulating disease and providing spiritual fulfilment. Without nature, there would be no life.\u201d</p> <p>The ongoing destruction of nature has been blamed as the fundamental driver of diseases that cross from wildlife into humans. In April, the world\u2019s leading biodiversity experts said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/halt-destruction-nature-worse-pandemics-top-scientists\">even more deadly disease outbreaks were likely</a> unless the destruction is halted.</p> <p>Dasgupta is leading a major review on the economics of biodiversity for the UK government, due to be published later in 2020, and Anderson is an adviser. A similar UK government <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/publication/the-economics-of-climate-change-the-stern-review/\">review on climate change</a> led by Lord Nicholas Stern was highly influential in making the economic case for environmental action.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 is an SOS signal for the human enterprise, bringing into sharp focus the need to live within the planet\u2019s \u2018safe operating space\u2019, and the disastrous environmental, health and economic consequences of failing to do so,\u201d said Dasgupta and Anderson. \u201cA key problem is the mismatch between the artificial \u2018economic grammar\u2019 which drives public and private policy and \u2018nature\u2019s syntax\u2019 which determines how the real world operates.\u201d</p> <p>They said \u2018natural capital\u2019 \u2013 the planet\u2019s stock of natural resources, like plants, soils and minerals \u2013 should be valued alongside the values of produced capital, such as roads, and human capital, such as skills. Together, these form a measure of a country\u2019s true wealth, they said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/resources/report/inclusive-wealth-report-2018\">Data from the UN Environment Programme</a> shows that the global stock of natural capital per capita has declined nearly 40% since the early 1990s, while produced capital has doubled and human capital has increased by 13%. \u201cUnlike standard models of economic growth and development, placing ourselves and our economies within nature helps us to accept that our prosperity is ultimately bounded by that of our planet,\u201d Dasgupta and Anderson said.</p> <p>\u201cThe importance of taking decisions guided by the science has become all the more apparent in recent months,\u201d they said. \u201cAs discussions about the recovery gather pace, economic and finance decisions must be guided by the science too. From now on, protecting and enhancing our environment must be at the heart of how we achieve economic prosperity.\u201d</p> <p>The largest previous <a href=\"http://www.teebweb.org/our-publications/teeb-study-reports/synthesis-report/\">assessment of the economics of biodiversity</a> was published on 2010 and was led by Pavan Sukhdev, formerly at Deutsche Bank and now president of WWF International and a UN environment ambassador.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe blind pursuit of profit at the expense of all else \u2013 it\u2019s simply a fool\u2019s dream and sadly, we seem to have believed it,\u201d Sukhdev <a href=\"http://www.teebweb.org/our-publications/teeb-study-reports/synthesis-report/\">said this week</a>. \u201cNature also provides a lot: you can estimate the economic cost you will incur by losing nature\u2019s services.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think the time has come for humanity to go through its next evolution, intellectually, emotionally, and recognise that we can be different, we don\u2019t have to go back to the same old ways, business as usual,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The prominent naturalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jun/03/jane-goodall-humanity-is-finished-if-it-fails-to-adapt-after-covid-19\">Jane Goodall said on Wednesday</a> that the emergence of Covid-19 was the result of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/tip-of-the-iceberg-is-our-destruction-of-nature-responsible-for-covid-19-aoe\">over-exploitation of the natural world</a>. She said humanity will be \u201cfinished\u201d if we fail to drastically change our food systems.</p> <p>Dasgupta and Anderson said: \u201cOne truly worrying result of our over-demand is that critical ecosystems are reaching tipping points.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>They said ocean heatwaves were destroying coral reefs, with devastating economic impacts on the large numbers of people that depend on them, while the felling of tropical forests is pushing them dangerously close to tipping points that would switch them to grassland, with enormous consequences for the climate crisis.</p>",

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2><strong>Cases pass 6.6 million worldwide</strong></h2> <p>The number of known coronavirus infections has passed 6.6 million, with 6,601,349 confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Deaths are approaching 390,000, with the current toll at 389,645. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected under-reporting.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil\u2019s death toll overtakes Italy\u2019s to become third-highest globally</strong></h2> <p>Brazil\u2019s total Covid-19 death toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/coronavirus-brazil-record-daily-death-toll-mexico\">passed that of Italy on Thursday</a>, as the Health Ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the US and the UK.</p> <h2><strong>Ebola drug&nbsp;endorsed as a treatment in Australia</strong></h2> <p>The antiviral drug remdesivir has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/remdesivir-ebola-drug-endorsed-as-a-coronavirus-treatment-in-australia\">recommended for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Australia</a>. The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce said Australian doctors treating adults with moderate, severe or critical Covid-19 should consider using the drug to aid recovery times.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/01/remdesivir-five-australian-hospitals-to-receive-experimental-coronavirus-drug\">The antiviral drug</a> is the first medication to be recommended as a considered treatment for patients in hospital after contracting coronavirus. </p> <h2><strong>South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases</strong></h2> <p>South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure.</p> <h2><strong>New York governor urges protesters to get tested</strong></h2> <p>The thousands of people protesting over the death of George Floyd have a \u201ccivic duty\u201d to be tested for the coronavirus and help New York avoid a spike in new cases as it slowly restarts its economy, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. An estimated 20,000 people have demonstrated in New York City alone, Cuomo said, as he expanded the state\u2019s testing criteria to include people who attended recent protests. </p> <h2><strong>Mexico man dies after face mask arrest</strong></h2> <p>Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/mexican-arrested-for-not-wearing-face-mask-later-found-dead\">for not wearing a face mask in public</a>. Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, was detained on 4 May in the town of Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de Los Membrillos near Guadalajara. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ssbeltran/status/1268514693947297794?s=20\">Video of the incident</a>&nbsp;emerged on Wednesday, and shows officers with assault rifles forcing L\u00f3pez into a truck as bystanders plead for his release. Meanwhile Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported a record 4,442 additional cases on Thursday, and 816 more deaths, bringing the total to 105,680 cases and 12,545 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Covid-19 causing 10,000 dementia deaths in UK</strong></h2> <p>There were almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/covid-19-causing-10000-dementia-deaths-beyond-infections-research-says\">10,000 unexplained extra deaths among people with dementia</a> in April, according to official figures that have prompted alarm about the severe impact of social isolation on people with the condition. The data, from the&nbsp;Office for National Statistics, reveals that, beyond deaths directly linked to Covid-19, there were 83% more deaths from dementia than usual, with charities warning that a reduction in essential medical care and family visits were taking a devastating toll.</p> <h2><strong>Argentina extends lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Argentina extended a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires and other parts of the country until 28 June, as confirmed cases continued to rise, passing 20,000 earlier in the day. The three-week extension of the lockdown will affect the capital, the province of Buenos Aires and other areas that have the highest concentration of confirmed infections, President Alberto Fernandez said.</p> <h2><strong>Patients with high blood pressure twice as likely to die: study</strong></h2> <p>Patients with high blood pressure admitted to hospital with coronavirus are twice as likely to die as those without the condition, researchers said on Friday. For in-patients with the virus who had stopped taking medication for high blood pressure, the risk of dying doubled again, they reported in the European Heart Journal after reviewing cases in Wuhan.</p> <h2><strong>Long waitfor Tokyo Olympics decision</strong></h2> <p>A Tokyo 2020 executive board member said on Friday that organisers will need to monitor the coronavirus situation until spring next year to decide whether to hold the Summer Olympics, Kyodo News reported. The comment by lawmaker Toshiaki Endo, one of six vice presidents on the board and a former Olympics minister, marks the first time an executive from the organising committee has commented on the timing for a decision on going through with the Games, the news agency said. The Games were postponed from this year because of the pandemic.</p>",
  "<p>While I was waiting for Wiley to answer the phone for our interview, he was busily tweeting about the greatness of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/06/the-wire-10-years-on-we-tore-the-cover-off-a-city-and-showed-the-american-dream-was-dead\">The Wire</a> (\u201cpeople will be tryna copy it for ever\u201d), the killing of George Floyd (\u201cthere has to be consequences\u201d), and his spice-free passionfruit and mango flavour order at Nando\u2019s (\u201cno shame at all\u201d). It is hard to imagine someone more committed to sharing their every waking thought with the world. So it came as a surprise to discover that his new album would be his last. \u201cI\u2019m 41,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to try and fit in with kids. I just need to not let my genre die on the way out.\u201d</p> <p>This is not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/24/wiley-godfather-grime\">the godfather of grime</a>\u2019s first supposed exit. The first time I interviewed Wiley for the Guardian, in a council flat on the Isle of Dogs in east London in 2007, he was talking about retiring then, too. He seemed weary, burned out by the tensions and beefs of a fractious London pirate radio scene. It was a different universe from the internationally popular, festival-headlining colossus that is black British music in 2020.</p> <p>That day, he said: \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m 28 \u2013 when it\u2019s peaking, I ain\u2019t even going to be here.\u201d Thirteen years, one No 1 (plus two more with his crew Roll Deep), nine Top 20 singles, a few dozen albums and mixtapes, an MBE and Ivor Novello inspiration and NME outstanding contribution awards later, it seems fair to say that he found a second wind.</p> <p>Today, he releases Godfather III, his final album as Wiley. It was not the swan song he had intended. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huaE85-V8u4\">his glorious 2019 dancehall earworm Boasty</a> \u2013 a single featuring guest spots from the confounding but inspired combination of the British rapper <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/11/stefflon-don-live-review-trinity-centre-bristol-nme\">Stefflon Don</a>, the Jamaican pop star Sean Paul and the British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/idris-elba\">Idris Elba</a> \u2013 became his first to rack up more than 100m YouTube views. It spent more than half of 2019 in the charts. \u201cIt won\u2019t die!\u201d he says, laughing.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huaE85-V8u4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/huaE85-V8u4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Still going strong ... watch the video for Boasty.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Boasty\u2019s global commercial success was set to lead to something equally triumphant \u2013 a dancehall-heavy, Atlantic-straddling album of big-name collaborations called Full Circle, due for an autumn 2019 release. In August, he revealed <a href=\"https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/News/latest-news/wileys-new-album-will-feature-nicki-minaj-future-donaeo-and-more\">the all-star track listing</a>, featuring guest spots from Nicki Minaj, Popcaan, Future and Beenie Man. But only a fortnight later <a href=\"https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/11/wiley-drake-ovo-sound-nicki-minaj-popcaan\">the project seemed to be in serious jeopardy</a>, with Wiley claiming on Twitter that Drake had blocked the use of a verse by his Ovo label signee Popcaan and that Minaj was \u201cgoing to start her family\u201d. The album never materialised.</p> <p>He won\u2019t be drawn on the specifics of who nixed Full Circle \u2013 the blame goes far wider than Drake \u2013 but it has left him weary of anything but total independence. \u201cI was on a roll and Full Circle, with all its international features \u2013 that was going to be nuts,\u201d says Wiley. \u201cThat was my dream come true, as an urban artist. But no one wanted me to do it: the industry looked up and said: \u2018Ah, no, not him again. Get him out of here.\u2019 I was really upset that it didn\u2019t get to surface.\u201d</p> <p>Wiley has long embodied grime\u2019s irrepressible DIY energy, which never rubs up well with the suits. Among other spectacular fallouts, in 2013 he leaked his breakthrough pop album on Warner a fortnight before its release after a dispute over the track listing. Even after all his success, his team is limited to a manager, John Woolf, while his sister, Janaya Cowie, takes care of some business affairs \u2013 and that is it. As with most of his extensive catalogue, he is self-releasing Godfather III. There can be few national treasures with whom a national newspaper interview is arranged via direct messages on Twitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cef8e1c71120bd239b6b08b6eb12d3544374231\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cef8e1c71120bd239b6b08b6eb12d3544374231/0_0_2003_2939/682.jpg\" alt=\"Wiley on stage at South West Four festival in London in August 2019\" width=\"682\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t want to try and fit in with kids\u2019 ... on stage at South West Four festival in London in August.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Okpako/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The collapse of Full Circle saw Wiley return stoically to \u201cdoing what I\u2019m here to do\u201d: finishing 22 tracks of his first and truest love: grime. \u201cWhen they blocked Full Circle, I made it my goal to make sure the grime scene wheels are spinning before I leave,\u201d he says, repeating for emphasis: \u201cI need those wheels to be spinning.\u201d The result is the final part of his own Godfather trilogy \u2013 and yes, he has heard the jokes about the panned final instalment to the Francis Ford Coppola series.</p> <p>He need not be worried. It is an album with the sonic energy and crackling wit of his first grime outings in the mid 00s, but with the catharsis and wisdom you would expect of a star who has overseen two often-relentless decades of hype, beefs, peaks and troughs.</p> <p>Loose ends are tied up \u2013 one track pays homage to Rinse FM, the celebrated Bow pirate station <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUSOzyDg0e8\">he first appeared on in the </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUSOzyDg0e8\">90s</a>; another is named after his epochal grime rave, Eskimo Dance. The latter is a 13-MC, 13-verse medley in which the microphone is passed, and the instrumental switches from one classic to another, every eight bars.</p> <p>When the dust settles and the album\u2019s resting heart rate has returned to normal, his knack for candid self-reflection is also as powerful as ever. \u201cLast year, I could have killed the game, the system didn\u2019t let me / A&amp;Rs and bosses wishing fans would just forget me,\u201d he raps on Press Record, the maudlin final track. Instead of the global grandstanding of Boasty, this is, he intones gently, \u201cthat \u2018Clear your head, sitting by the lake\u2019 shit \u2026 that \u2018In the end, no one is your mate\u2019 shit.\u201d His parting words are: \u201cBaby, I ain\u2019t got a clue where my life\u2019s going.\u201d</p> <p>But the mood is not bitter or resigned and looks to the future as much as the past. Wiley opted against all-star grime veteran guests and instead called on the next generation of London MCs, tweeting his fans to nominate the best new talent and then inviting them to deliver verses.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to help,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of the stuff I do seems like nothing at the time, but then when a star comes from it you\u2019ll realise. The people in the top of grime, they don\u2019t even wanna be grime, do they? They wanna be hip-hop! So this is the perfect time to work with new MCs who love grime, because I\u2019m on my way out.\u201d Wiley mentored, boosted and paid for studio time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/dizzeerascal\">Dizzee Rascal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tinchy-stryder\">Tinchy Stryder</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta\">Skepta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/chipmunk\">Chip</a>, among others. A little-known MC called Stormzy, he reminds me, was brought on stage to perform at a Wiley gig in January 2015 \u2013 which seems as good a point as any to ask what the hell happened at the start of this year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am part of a genre that they\u2019ve been nicking artists from for years, making millions and then throwing them away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/29/stormzy-glastonbury-review-pyramid-stage\">Stormzy\u2019s historic 2019 Glastonbury headline performance</a>, he released the unabashed homage Wiley Flow, adapting some classic lyrics and flows from the elder MC: the ultimate tribute. Yet, by January, the two MCs were topping YouTube\u2019s trending charts with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/08/wiley-vs-stormzy-sparks-fly-in-grimes-generation-game\">a series of taut, ferocious, mum-cussing diss tracks</a> against each other. \u201cWe\u2019re over it now,\u201d Wiley assures me. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Stormzy, I\u2019ve got love for him. I just wish he hadn\u2019t jumped in the way to defend Ed; that\u2019s the only reason it happened. Ed Sheeran, England\u2019s golden boy \u2013 he can use you, but you\u2019re not allowed to use him.\u201d</p> <p>Wiley collaborated with Sheeran on the latter\u2019s 2011 EP No 5 Collaborations Project, all eight tracks of which featured grime MCs;&nbsp;its success <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/suffolk/hi/people_and_places/music/newsid_9354000/9354954.stm\">won Sheeran his first record deal</a>. Wiley\u2019s problem now, he says, is with Sheeran piggybacking on grime for street cachet without supporting its artists. In 2019, Sheeran went to No 1 with Take Me Back to London, a single with Stormzy, alongside a remix featuring new-school MCs Aitch and Jaykae. \u201cWhen he tried to put out that grime remix, I was like: nah, man, this is not sitting well with me,\u201d Wiley says. \u201cBecause we\u2019re not allowed to use you: you haven\u2019t given a shit about us, since the time you started, until Stormzy came along. I don\u2019t like the way that grime gets used.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Sheeran said he had agreed to \u201c90% of the features I\u2019ve been personally asked for, unless I\u2019ve been on a break or I haven\u2019t known the artist \u2026 You know I have a deep respect for the scene, and for you.\u201d</p> <p>The ensuing diss tracks injected life into the genre after drill and other US rap styles had come to dominate the UK scene. In the midst of the clash in January, two teenagers on my morning commute pored over every line of each diss track, picking out their favourite zingers and comparing the two MCs\u2019 stature. Grime felt like the centre of attention again \u2013 and Wiley with it. Austin Daboh, an executive at Atlantic Records, observed in 2019 that while hip-hop is like the tides \u2013 steady, relentless, reliable \u2013 \u201cgrime is like a tsunami. It retracts from the shore \u2026 and all of a sudden, every few years, it comes and crashes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d61263bed617836689561ca4fec83f70e07ecade\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d61263bed617836689561ca4fec83f70e07ecade/0_0_4818_3281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wiley with his MBE for services to music\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wiley MBE ... he was recognised for his services to music in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately, Wiley admits, it was not Stormzy or even Sheeran that he was angry with, but a music industry and media that will drop a genre \u201cthe minute they can\u2019t control it or monetise it. I am part of a genre that they\u2019ve been nicking artists from for years, making millions and then throwing them away. If you\u2019re a businessman, at what point do you even care what you\u2019re selling?\u201d His voice rises with incredulity: \u201cHumans have managed to sell water back to humans! Humans are nang.\u201d</p> <p>As well as music industry fickleness, he says, there is a lack of coordination and teamwork from grime and rap artists themselves, especially as success atomises them ever further. It is all a long way from the crew-driven scenes of jungle, garage and grime he started out with. Stormzy, releasing under his own label, but via a deal with Atlantic, a major label, \u201cshould be owned by \u2018The Grime Group\u2019 or something like that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been 20 years and we should have got our legal and business brain on by this time. That\u2019s where we keep going wrong! Each one of us, when we get cosy next to a manager and a good lawyer, that\u2019s it \u2013 gone. People retreat into their mansion.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>At the start of lockdown, even though I was panicking, I realised this is how I\u2019ve spent half my life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He sketches out a mafia-esque \u201cgathering of the five families\u201d that would have the likes of Skepta, Kano and Lethal Bizzle running grime and reaping the profits. His long-lost mentee Dizzee Rascal is also invited: the pair became estranged following the latter\u2019s stabbing in Ayia Napa, Cyprus, in 2003 and Wiley still feels responsible for allowing the feud to happen. \u201cDizzee, your chair\u2019s at the table, too \u2013 I tell you what, I\u2019ll put my chair right down the other end, so you don\u2019t have to sit next to me.\u201d</p> <p>For now, Wiley is ready to promote the album, launch The Wiley Podcast (at the request of the record label Sony) and maybe then get back to Cyprus, where he and his family spend three months of the year. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says with genuine alarm, \u201cI\u2019ve realised I need to go to Cyprus to empty the fridge. It\u2019s going to stink.\u201d</p> <p>He has endured lockdown, but he has not found it easy \u2013 nor written one bar of music. In normal times, he likes to keep moving. \u201cI think it helps your mind,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve grown up with a council estate mind, kind of boxed in \u2013 so travelling helps. But, saying that, when you\u2019re in the studio, you\u2019re in quarantine anyway. At the start of lockdown, even though I was panicking, I realised this is how I\u2019ve spent half my life \u2013 I wake up, I go on the laptop, I drink tea, I go inside a studio, all day, and I don\u2019t leave until 10pm.

Whimn, or \u201cwith her in mind\u201d, aimed to take on Mamamia and be \u201cthe number one female news and information source in this country\u201d when it launched in 2016.

For the fourth month in a row ABC News is No 1 in the <a href=\"https://mumbrella.com.au/news-com-au-tumbles-to-sixth-in-ranking-of-australias-most-popular-websites-as-abc-maintains-lead-630211\">Nielsen digital content ratings</a> and news.com.au has surprisingly plummeted from No 2 to No 6, after spending most of 2019 at No 1.</p> <p>Which brings us to the Australian and its gold medal performance in the spin category this week.

In March, which saw a huge spike in news across the board, the Oz managed to enter the top 10 digital news sites for the first time since 2018 but in April it dropped out again. With the Oz a no-show there is now only one News Corp masthead \u2013 news.com.au \u2013 in the top 10 news brands in the country.</p> <h2><strong>Saturation coverage</strong></h2> <p>The Nielsen&nbsp;data for news sites showed a big drop across all publishers in April as interest in the coronavirus waned after a big spike in interest in March.</p> <p>The protests in the US and the return of live sport has seen coverage of coronavirus drop below 50% of all news articles for the first time in nearly three months, according to data from Streem&nbsp;media monitoring. The Covid-19 media saturation peaked on 24 March when the virus was mentioned in 81% of stories published &nbsp;that day. In January there was a peak of 36% for the bushfire coverage.</p> <p>Last Friday the coronavirus content fell below 50% for the first time since 13 March.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Boxing clever</strong></h2> <p>All credit to the Australian\u2019s photographer Nic Walker for giving us this image of 60-year-old box manufacturer Anthony Pratt.
