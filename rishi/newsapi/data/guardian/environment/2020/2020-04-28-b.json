  "<p>Donald Trump has predicted a \u201cgreat\u201d economic rebound in the fall and claimed the country would soon be performing 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day, as the number of confirmed cases in the US surpassed a million.</p> <p>Some health experts have suggested that the US would have to carry out 5m tests a day by June to reopen its economy safely. Others have suggested as many as <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/20/1000228/the-us-will-need-to-do-20-million-tests-a-day-to-reopen-safely/\">20m</a><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/20/1000228/the-us-will-need-to-do-20-million-tests-a-day-to-reopen-safely/\"> tests a day</a> would ultimately be needed. The US daily rate is currently 200,000.</p> <p>Addressing a news conference on aid to small businesses on Tuesday, Trump appeared unaware of the current figures, suggesting \u201cit could be that we\u2019re getting very close\u201d to 5m daily tests.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be there very soon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The US has carried out 5.6m tests over the past two months, which as Trump pointed out was <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing\">far more than any other country</a>, but represented about 1.6% of the population, a higher percentage than most countries, though significantly below Italy.</p> <p>Trump was also bullish on the prospects for economic recovery in the fall.</p> <p>\u201cNow our country\u2019s opening up again and I think it\u2019s going to be very, very successful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the fourth quarter will be great. And I think next year is going to be a tremendous year for this country.\u201d</p> <p>In what looks almost certain to become another hostage to fortune, the president implied that the pandemic would be largely cleared by the fourth quarter of the year.</p> <p>\u201cI think what happens is it\u2019s going to go away. This is going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we\u2019ll be able to handle it. We\u2019ll be able to put out spurts, and we\u2019re very prepared to handle it.\u201d</p> <p>On a day that cases hit the grim 1m milestone and fatalities overtook the US death toll from the Vietnam war of 58,220, Trump was reminded that in February, he had predicted that infections would soon all but evaporate. The president said on 26 February, when there were only 15 confirmed US cases, that \u201cwithin a couple of days [it\u2019s] going to be down to close to zero, That\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>He replied on Tuesday that it would \u201cultimately\u201d be true.</p> <p>\u201cAt the appropriate time it will be down to zero, like we said,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>The US began wholesale testing weeks later than many other developed countries, a fact Trump hinted was the fault of the previous administration.</p> <p>\u201cWe inherited a very broken test,\u201d he said, although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">faulty test</a> was produced in early February, three years into Trump\u2019s administration. The president also pointed to unnamed experts for the initial complacency of the administration\u2019s response.</p> <p>\u201cMany very good experts, very good people too, said that this would never affect the United States, it wouldn\u2019t affect Europe, it wouldn\u2019t affect anything outside of China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we were listening to experts and we always will listen to experts, but the experts got it wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Global health experts were almost unanimous in raising the alarm over the coronavirus threat in January and February. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/presidents-intelligence-briefing-book-repeatedly-cited-virus-threat/2020/04/27/ca66949a-8885-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html\">US intelligence agencies had also issued warnings</a> about the scale of the coronavirus threats in more than a dozen of the president\u2019s daily classified briefings over the course of January and February.</p> <p>The danger was played down, however, by several television personalities who the president watches regularly, and reportedly by his health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, who according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-chiefs-early-missteps-set-back-coronavirus-response-11587570514\">Wall Street Journal</a> assured Trump on 29 January that the coronavirus was under control in the US.</p>",
  "<p>When New Zealand holds its post-virus general election later this year, the country will go through a fiercely ideological debate about economics and resources.</p> <p>On 19 September, New Zealanders are scheduled to go to the polls. By then, the country is likely to have eliminated Covid-19, providing an enormous boost for Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/new-zealand-starts-gradual-exit-from-coronavirus-lockdown\">which is blitzing the immediate health crisis.</a></p> <p>However, at the election New Zealanders will also be evaluating the contrasting left-and rightwing prescriptions for dealing with a severe economic depression. And that could see a fiercely-ideological election debate based around economics and resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Currently, the treasury is forecasting unemployment could go as high as 26%. Regardless of whether this worst-case scenario comes to pass, there will be extreme economic dislocation and suffering. Politicians will need to provide voters with a compelling vision, backed by detailed policies, for rebuilding the country.</p> <p>Recreating the old order won\u2019t be good enough. After all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/ardern-accused-of-making-new-zealand-businesses-sacrificial-lambs-in-covid-19-lockdown\">the looming depression </a>will come on top of huge pre-existing problems of inequality, poverty, a housing affordability crisis, and a creaking welfare state.</p> <p>If Labour is to embody the spirit of the times, it will embrace radical new economic policies. This means proposing new progressive income taxes, a wealth tax, a universal basic income, a massive state housing programme, and an overhaul of the public health system. And that\u2019s just for starters.</p> <p>If National is to keep to its conservative impulses, then it will campaign on being \u201cbetter economic managers\u201d, cutting regulations, reducing taxes on business, and generally letting the private sector lead the recovery.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s unlikely that a traditional austerity sales pitch will be welcome in 2020. The landscape has changed dramatically, with traditional rightwing economic prescriptions now jettisoned by governments of all colours. Instead of a small state being the answer, the crisis has required huge state intervention. As a number of economists have noted, we\u2019re all socialists now.</p> <p>The state has even bailed out of the most rightwing voice in New Zealand politics \u2013 the Taxpayers Union. For this neoliberal lobby group to apply for, and be given, $60,000 of subsidies in order to keep operating is testament to the fact that the old order of pro-market politics has died.</p> <p>National will have to do better than recycle policies from the neoliberal era. In fact, to be truly competitive it is very likely, come September, they will be proposing their own big-spending statist economic interventions. On issues such as infrastructure, National has the potential to be an even bigger party of government than Labour.</p> <p>Policies such as a universal basic income \u2013 once relegated to the political fringes \u2013 could even be adopted by the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/covid-19-crisis-reset-economies-sustainable-footing\">The Covid-19 crisis creates a chance to reset economies on a sustainable footing | James Shaw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the immediate future, politics is going to be all about economics. In that sense it will mark the return of the traditional left-right politics that dominated the 20th century, before social issues gained the ascendancy. Since the 1960s, politics in countries like New Zealand have become less about economics (or what political scientists call \u201cmaterialist concerns\u201d) and more about post-materialist issues.</p> <p>These non-economic issues \u2013 debates on everything from nuclear weapons, abortion, sexual politics, racism and environmentalism \u2013 never fitted easily into the traditional left-right spectrum.</p> <p>Important debates raised by feminists, M\u0101ori nationalists, the peace movement, environmentalists and so forth also brought into play concepts such as culture wars, political correctness, identity politics, woke politics, and social liberalism. Alongside this, other non-materialist concerns around free speech, immigration, and religion have been central to understanding modern politics.</p> <p>The importance of these strains of contemporary politics wax and wane, and at various times the culture wars have receded. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, there was a concentration on more basic economic issues. On the left there was a spike of concern about workers\u2019 rights, economic inequality, the welfare state, and so forth.</p> <p>Such concerns underpinned much of the debate in New Zealand\u2019s 2008, 2011 and 2014 elections. Then, with economic prosperity returning, post-materialist concerns came to the fore again. Issues like gender and ethnic inequality dominated, especially on the left. And climate change grew to become an overarching concern.</p> <p>In the wake of Covid-19, post-materialist issues are likely to weaken once again, becoming overshadowed by more basic concerns about putting food on the table.</p> <p>Labour and National, as the original left-right political parties, will be relatively well suited to this re-emerging debate on economic and resource issues.</p> <p>But where will the minor parties fit in? Even before the coronavirus crisis, the minor parties were struggling for relevance. This situation has only been made worse, and some could even be finished off by the return to a more economic focus.</p> <p>The Greens are unlikely to prosper, and may not even survive, as concerns about the environment take a back seat for voters dealing with an economic crisis.</p> <p>The rightwing Act party, which has at times played a central role in the culture wars, especially on free speech issues, will have to reorientate towards its original radical pro-business programme.</p> <p>The M\u0101ori party, currently out of Parliament, will have to prioritise being the voice of M\u0101ori at the bottom of the economic pile.</p> <p>There is still one rising non-economic concern that provides an opportunity for a minor party: nationalism. According to a number of opinion polls we\u2019re experiencing a surge of patriotism. People are celebrating New Zealand\u2019s stand-out success in battling the virus. There\u2019s one party that is uniquely equipped to surf that wave \u2013 Winston Peters\u2019 New Zealand First.</p> <p>Given National has ruled out building a government with Peters\u2019 help, any surge of nationalist support for NZ First will make the re-election of the Labour-led Government much more likely, regardless of what happens in the economic debates.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bryce Edwards is a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand</em></p></li> </ul>",

Headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30134-0/fulltext?dgcid=raven_jbs_etoc_email\">Decolonising Covid-19</a>\u201d, it argues that even before the health impact of the pandemic has been felt in the developing world, it\u2019s economic impact is proving hugely damaging. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>UNDP has estimated income losses of US$220 billion in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and that nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost. This, combined with the potential health impact, could be catastrophic. A Comment published in The Lancet Global Health in April found that a rapid acceleration in the number of cases in west Africa, as has been seen in Europe, could quickly overwhelm vulnerable health systems that typically have fewer than five hospital beds per 10,000 population. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>There is a risk, the Lancet says, that attempts to tackle the pandemic by richer nations could leave the developing world \u201cin the dark\u201d, whilst, at the same time, expertise developed in Africa from dealing with, for example, the Ebola epidemics, is not being respected. </p> \n  <p>And, it adds, \u201ca sinister undercurrent has re-emerged\u201d as teams around the world race to develop treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the beginning of April, two French doctors sparked an intense backlash over comments made during a live television discussion about Covid-19 trials in Europe and Australia by saying that the studies should be done in Africa first \u201cwhere there are no masks, no treatments, no resuscitation\u201d, reasoning that certain studies on AIDS had been carried out in prostitutes \u201cbecause we know that they are highly exposed and that they do not protect themselves\u201d. </p> \n   <p>Africa is a continent where the legacy of colonialism is particularly heavy. It is shocking to hear these remarks from scientists in the 21st century, at a time when the work of epidemiologists, infectious disease modellers, public health specialists and, indeed, all health workers, is in the public spotlight like never before. At the WHO press briefing on April 6, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded plainly, \u201cTo be honest, I was so appalled, and it was at a time when I said we needed solidarity. These kinds of racist remarks will not help. It goes against solidarity. Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine \u2026 The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2820%2930134-0\">Read the rest of the article here</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:44:46.071Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea83bf48f082c9ba20aa187\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T14:23:22.004Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is <strong>Damien Gayle</strong> taking back control on the live blog now, with thanks to Simon Burnton for covering my break.

This will now be eased and new measures introduced. These include a nationwide night-time curfew, mandatory wearing of facemasks and a ban on \u201cnon-essential\u201d travel between different regions.</p> \n  <p>But a new and immediate two-week lockdown will be imposed in northern Nigeria\u2019s largest city Kano after officials said they were probing reports of \u201cmysterious deaths\u201d that doctors say often involve pneumonia.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>South Africa</strong>, where a strict nationwide lockdown has confined 56 million people to their homes for all but essential journeys since late March, restrictions are being loosened on Friday to allow some people to go back to work in designated industries and basic public transport to function. Schools however remain shut and sales of alcohol banned.</p> \n  <p>South Africa has been lauded for its aggressive effort to root out pockets of infection with screening and testing, as well as its big economic relief package. However there are signs that the lockdown - which has been largely respected - is beginning to fray. </p> \n  <p>In a national address last week, Cyril Ramaphosa described five stages of progressively looser lockdown. But no dates have been given for moving down (or up) the scale beyond May 1st and the shift to phase four, and different phases can be imposed in different parts of the country simultaneously. </p> \n  <p>Strategies have differed across Africa. <strong>Kenya </strong>has imposed a loose lockdown in the capital Nairobi and port city of Mombasa along with a nationwide curfew. <strong>Ghana </strong>recently lifted most of the restrictions placed on inhabitants of major cities but has maintained a ban on social events and public gatherings are still banned. </p> \n  <p>So too has the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, which imposed a loose lockdown on parts of the capital Kinshasa. In <strong>Malawi</strong>, legal action has blocked attempts by the government to impose a lockdown while in <strong>Tanzania</strong>, president John Magufuli has been criticised for not imposing one fast enough. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:57:26.830Z\">at 2.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea8312c8f08103bdf809770\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kim-willsher\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:41:09.496Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Philippe also said there was a risk of France\u2019s economy collapsing if the lockdown was not ended, and that the country\u2019s hospitals had held up well to the challenge posed by the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe risk of a second wave, which might mean another lockdown, is a risk we have to take seriously,\u201d he said, adding France had to \u201cprotect, test and isolate\u201d. </p> \n  <p>The lockdown would be followed by a monitoring phase, which would continue until 2 June, with regulations differing between regions. \u201cOur national strategy has to be adapted to different circumstances,\u201d Philippe said, adding that he would be meeting local officials on Wednesday and unions on Thursday to discuss the end of lockdown measures.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo, we have to live with virus, to end the lockdown progressively and adapt to circumstances; these are the three elements of our strategy,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p>Philippe said the availability of masks had been a subject that angered and upset a lot of French people. \u201cGiving masks to medical workers, necessarily meant depriving others of them,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>He said local authorities that bought masks would be reimbursed by the government for half the price, and that there would be enough masks in the country for the general public by 11 May, the day the lockdown ends, but said it would be some time for masks to be freely and widely available in shops.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:43:53.198Z\">at 2.43pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea8301f8f082c9ba20aa0f2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kim-willsher\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-28T13:33:25.592Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">French prime minister outlines schedule for end of lockdown</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The French prime minister, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">\u00c9douard Philippe,</strong><strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>has begun outlining the schedule for the end of the coronavirus lockdown in France to MPs in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. </p> \n  <p>Philippe began saying the situation was unique. \u201cWho could have envisaged a France where schools, universities, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, the majority of businesses, libraries \u2026 beaches, stadia \u2026 would be closed.

the lowest per capita in the world. </p> \n  <p>The antibody tests taken from blood samples do not always pick up early-stage infections but show whether a person had the virus in the past, even if the person had no symptoms. </p> \n  <p>In comparison, the standard swab test determines whether a person has the virus at that moment by looking for it in secretions. <br></p> \n  <p> Several Indian

unification minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, told lawmakers. </p> \n  <p>He said at a parliamentary hearing </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is true that

particularly unusual given the current (coronavirus) situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on Monday he has a good idea how Kim Jong-un is doing and hopes he is fine, but would not elaborate. </p> \n  <p>The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he was aware of reports on Kim\u2019s health and he was was paying close attention to developments. </p> \n  <p>North Korea had cancelled some large events, and imposed a border lockdown and quarantine measures in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>But if Kim Jong-un is hiding out due to fears surrounding Covid-19, it would \u201cpuncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed\u201d, said Chad O\u2019Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which

has rejected claims it was the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The head of the lab told Reuters the claims have no basis in fact, adding there were still no conclusive answers as to where the disease started. </p> \n  <p> Conspiracy theorists have claimed Covid-19, now responsible for more than 200,000 deaths worldwide, was synthesised by the <strong>Wuhan Institute of Virology</strong> (WIV), based in the city where the disease was first identified. </p> \n  <p>Though the scientific consensus is that the coronavirus evolved naturally, such claims have gained traction. </p> \n  <p>The US president, Donald Trump, said on 15 April that his government was investigating whether it had originated in the Wuhan lab. </p> \n  <p>Yuan Zhiming, professor at WIV and the director of its National Biosafety Laboratory, said \u201cmalicious\u201d claims about the lab had been \u201cpulled out of thin air\u201d and contradicted all available evidence. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe WIV does not have the intention and the ability to design and construct a new coronavirus,\u201d he said in written responses to questions from Reuters. \u201cMoreover, there is no information within the SARS-CoV-2 genome indicating it was manmade.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Some conspiracy theories were fuelled by a widely read scientific paper from the Indian Institute of Technology, since withdrawn, claiming that proteins in the coronavirus shared an \u201cuncanny similarity\u201d with those of HIV. </p> \n  <p>However, most scientists now say Covid-19 originated in wildlife, with bats and pangolins identified as possible host species. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMore than 70% of emerging infectious diseases originated from animals, especially wild animals,\u201d Yuan said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn recent years, we have seen increasing risks posed by close contact between humans and wild animals, with global climate change and the continuous expansion of human activities,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>All seven known human coronaviruses have origins in bats, mice or domestic animals, scientists say. </p> \n  <p>Yuan also rejected theories that the lab had accidentally released a coronavirus it had harvested from bats for research purposes, saying the lab\u2019s biosecurity procedures were strictly enforced. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHigh-level biosafety labs have sophisticated protective facilities and strict measures to ensure the safety of laboratory staff and protect the environment from contamination,\u201d he said. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

  "<p>British Airways has set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The airline\u2019s chief executive, Alex Cruz, told BA\u2019s 42,000 staff on Tuesday night that the company \u201cmust act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future\u201d and that means more than one in four jobs must be cut.</p> <p>Cruz said the UK\u2019s flag carrier airline, which has placed 22,600 people on the government\u2019s furlough scheme, \u201ccannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday, British Airways flew just a handful of aircraft out of Heathrow. On a normal day we would fly more than 300. What we are facing as an airline, like so many other businesses up and down the country, is that there is no \u2018normal\u2019 any longer,\u201d <a href=\"https://mediacentre.britishairways.com/pressrelease/details/86/News-1/12272\">Cruz said in a letter to staff </a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a strong, well-managed business that has faced into, and overcome, many crises in our hundred-year history.

We must act decisively now to ensure that British Airways has a strong future and continues connecting Britain with the world.\u201d</p> <p>IAG said it had plunged to a loss of \u20ac535m (\u00a3465m) in the first three months of this year \u2013 with all the damage being done in March. In the same period last year the airline group made a profit of \u20ac135m. IAG also revealed it had made a one-off loss of \u20ac1.3bn \u2013 the result of taking out contracts to hedge against the possibility of rising oil prices. In fact the oil price has crashed.</p> <p>IAG said BA had been hit hardest, with other airlines in the group \u2013 Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling \u2013 feeling less impact.</p> <p>Unions responded with anger. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa, said staff were devastated by the \u201cbolt out of the blue\u201d news and that the union would fight for every job.</p> <p>\u201cBA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways,\u201d he said.</p> <p>BA, he added, had \u201csaid it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.\u201d</p> <p>The leader of the Unite union described BA\u2019s decision as heartless, and a \u201cstab in the back\u201d, saying it was \u201centirely at odds with the course of action followed by our European competitors as they seek a way through the coronavirus crisis\u201d.</p> <p>Len McCluskey said: \u201cTo reject government support but then expect their own staff to pay the cost of such a misjudgement, is irresponsible, dangerous and destructive and is utterly at odds with the mood of the country at a time of crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Nadine Houghton, national officer of GMB, the union for British Airways ground staff, said: \u201cIf the 12,000 figure is accurate this will be a huge blow for our loyal members.</p> <p>\u201cWe believed we had reached some relative, albeit temporary, respite for them following the agreement to furlough 80% of BA\u2019s staff \u2013 now this.</p> <p>\u201cI know our reps will work day and night to limit the impact on our members but 12,000 employees is a staggering number. All our efforts will be out into bringing that number down.\u201d</p> <p>The airline industry is facing its biggest ever challenge with the vast majority of flights grounded around the world. It is unclear when governments will allow airlines to resume a regular schedule.</p> <p>When planes do take to the skies again social distancing measures \u2013 which are likely to limit the density of passengers onboard \u2013 will make it hard for airlines to make the same profits as before.</p> <p>The global airlines trade association, Iata, has predicted that airlines could lose more than $300bn (\u00a3240bn) in the fallout from the pandemic and warned that 25m jobs are at risk.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an emergency. Airlines around the world are struggling to survive,\u201d Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s director general, said last week.</p> <p>\u201cGovernments will need financially viable airlines to lead the economic recovery. Many of them won\u2019t be around to do that if they have run out of cash. </p> <p>\u201cWe could see more than half of passenger revenues disappear. That would be a $314bn hit. And without urgent relief, many airlines will not survive to lead the economic recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Several airlines around the world are on the brink of collapse and many are urgently trying to secure government bailouts or emergency bank loans.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s Lufthansa is reportedly considering filing for creditor protection, as negotiations over state bailouts collapsed on Tuesday night. The airline is said to be burning through \u20ac1m of cash every hour, and has warned it will have 10,000 too many staff when it emerges from the crisis as a much smaller operator.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The budget airline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/norwegian-air-says-most-of-fleet-will-stay-grounded-until-2021-due-to-coronavirus\">Norwegian has warned</a> that virtually all of its fleet of aircraft will remain grounded until 2021 and is seeking to persuade shareholders to accept a government-backed rescue plan that will wipe out most of their investments. </p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is trying to find an investor to pump in millions to keep it afloat as it negotiates with the government for a \u00a3500m emergency loan.

He was re-elected last November with 61% of the vote.</p> <p>During Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, the GMB was sometimes regarded as a more moderate voice than Unite, whose general secretary, Len McCluskey, was an outspoken backer of Corbyn.</p> <p>Roache spoke out about the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism in 2018, saying he had been shocked by some of the examples he had seen.</p> <p>\u201cAntisemitism is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/aug/09/labour-antisemitism-credible-critic-israel\">a problem in the Labour party</a>.

Replying to claims that this was an attack on the party\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, Roache tweeted: \u201cThe GMB is NOT going for Jennie. FACT.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Six remarkably dry and sunny weeks coinciding with the coronavirus lockdown have given us a spring containing more butterflies than I can remember since childhood.</p> <p><a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/butterflies/peacock\">Peacocks</a> in particular seem to be booming, and so are <a href=\"https://butterfly-conservation.org/butterflies/orange-tip\">orange tips</a>. More thrilling are arrivals from the continent. Along the east coast from Yorkshire to Suffolk there has been a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thenorfolkcoast/status/1250757157785677825\">smattering</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrick_barkham/status/1250718220375523329\">large tortoiseshell sightings</a>. This <a href=\"https://www.ukbutterflies.co.uk/species.php?species=polychloros\">big but enigmatic butterfly</a> probably became extinct in Britain in the 1970s after Dutch elm disease decimated its major food source, but it has thrived in the Netherlands recently and easterly winds have brought it here. There\u2019s also an influx of red admirals in western areas.</p> <p>Butterfly numbers build with a succession of favourable summers and so this summer (following 2019, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/warm-summer-of-2019-gives-flight-to-butterfly-numbers\">the best butterfly year since 1997</a>) could be superb. But fine weather can only do so much.</p> <p>Unfortunately, judging by the volume of mowing in my neighbourhood, lockdown will not boost butterflies.</p> <p>People are gardening more intensively, and chemical farming continues, unaffected by coronavirus. Fields near me stink of sprays that are a cause of the long-term decline of many insects.</p> <p>We can\u2019t just rely on sunshine; we need to change our ways if butterflies are to bounce back for good.</p>",
  "<p>Cut early, cut deeply. This is a well-established response by the airline industry in times of crisis and, sadly for 12,000 staff at British Airways, it is always likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">to mean mass redundancies</a>.</p> <p>A ratio of slightly more than one-in-four jobs at the airline seems astonishing, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the company\u2019s analysis that Covid-19 will undermine demand for flying for \u201cseveral years\u201d. A global recession is certain and travel restrictions may be with us for ages. BA is not being uniquely pessimistic: over in Germany, Lufthansa thinks recovery will take until 2023, with 10,000 job losses possible.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely,\u201d said its chief executive, Alex Cruz.</p> <p>The first half of the statement isn\u2019t quite right: BA, if it could be untangled from parent IAG, which also owns Iberia in Spain and Aer Lingus, would qualify for a Bank of England-backed loan. The French and Dutch governments have been able to find a fudge for Air France-KLM. The point, though, is that adding debt doesn\u2019t really help in the long-term if the revenues aren\u2019t there \u2013 the sums still have to be repaid.</p> <p>As for the government\u2019s furlough schemes, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under pressure to extend, or taper them until the autumn. But he plainly cannot afford to underwrite wages for months on end. Amid the current talk about returning to work, the government will be alarmed by BA\u2019s cost-cutting \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to see what it could do to avert it.</p> <h2>A classic display of dividend bravado from BP</h2> <p>The oil environment is \u201cbrutal\u201d, said BP chief executive Bernard Looney, but shareholders can have their dividend anyway \u2013 at least for now.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/bp-plunges-into-first-quarter-loss-after-oil-price-collapse\">display of dividend bravado</a> was probably to be expected since every big oil company likes to promote its balance sheet as muscular. Investors, though, should not mistake willingness to swallow greater quantities of debt for real strength. In the current climate, BP, now carrying an astonishing $51bn (\u00a341bn) of net borrowing, is straining credibility on its dividend.</p> <p>What, for example, is the point of setting a supposedly rigid target for debt if you then ignore it? BP didn\u2019t just miss its 20-30% ambition for gearing \u2013 defined as debt as a percentage of total capital \u2013 it was out by miles. The ratio was 36.2% at the end of first quarter. Even BP expects it remain above 30% \u201cinto 2021\u201d before the trend turns downwards \u201cover time\u201d.</p> <p>The company isn\u2019t twiddling its thumbs, of course. It\u2019s cutting capital expenditure by a quarter this year to $12bn and can probably knock a billion or two off next year\u2019s budget. It will also hack $2.5bn out of costs by the end of 2021 and reckons its cash flows, including a stable dividend costing $8.4bn a year, would then balance at $35 a barrel. In normal times, that would be impressive. The trouble is, Brent stood at $20 a barrel on Tuesday.</p> <p>The full blast of the new oil world will only be felt in second quarter\u2019s figures. Tuesday\u2019s numbers, showing a slide in profits from $2.4bn to $791m, covered a period in which oil averaged $50 a barrel, which feels like a different age.</p> <p>The real decision on the divi, then, lies ahead. For believers in the idea that BP will be able smooth its way through the current turmoil, the shares offer an enticing 10.5% yield. It feels unlikely.</p> <h2>Hong Kong investors\u2019 beef should be with HSBC</h2> <p>Resentful Hong Kong investors won\u2019t agree, but should: the Bank of England did the right thing when it included HSBC in its ban on banks\u2019 distributions to shareholders this year.</p> <p>HSBC\u2019s capital position is currently healthy, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/hsbc-profit-coronavirus-outbreak-world-economies\">profits almost halved to $3.2bn</a> in the first quarter as the first batch of credit impairments arrived. Over the course of this year, provisions could hit $7bn-$11bn, a wide and tentative estimate that could yet become worse. Best to err on the side of caution on dividends.</p> <p>Instead of raging about perfidious regulators in London, Hongkongers should ask their board a few hard questions. Within the first quarter\u2019s $3bn provision, there was a \u201csignificant change related to a corporate exposure in Singapore\u201d, thought to be a bust oil trader. It rather suggests risk controls could have been better.</p>",

Added to a broader set of concerns about the impact of the lockdown on poorer, vulnerable and at-risk children, particularly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/28/calamitous-domestic-violence-set-to-soar-by-20-during-global-lockdown-coronavirus\" title=\"\">rise in domestic abuse</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/27/schools-shutdown-likely-to-widen-attainment-gap-says-ofsted-chief\" title=\"\">widening educational inequality</a> expected to follow from weeks of missed school and increased poverty, there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/children-in-care-at-risk-since-coronavirus-crisis-say-campaigners\" title=\"\">grounds to be seriously alarmed</a>.</p> <p>Children are less vulnerable than other age group to the virus itself, although deaths have of course been the cause of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">particular heartache,</a> as all deaths of children are. A new, serious illness that combines Covid-19 symptoms with others, described as a form of toxic shock syndrome, appears to be mercifully rare, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">about 12 cases</a> in the UK so far. But while attention is rightly focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/prejudice-older-people-coronavirus\" title=\"\">other vulnerable groups</a> (ethnic minorities, older and disabled adults) as well as on the population as a whole, there is a danger not only that children\u2019s interests are neglected, but also that adults are too distracted by other threats to do anything about this.</p> <p>Twice in the past four years, two previous children\u2019s ministers have attempted to roll back protections, including the entitlement of a child placed with new carers to be visited by a social worker within a week and checked on every six weeks. Independent six-monthly reviews of placements have been mandatory since the 1940s. But no longer. Now, following an abbreviated process that involved fielding queries from the Independent Children\u2019s Homes Association, but not discussions with the main adoption and fostering charities or children\u2019s rights groups, not only have visits been replaced with phone or video calls (reasonable in current circumstances), time limits for social worker checks and reviews have been removed.</p> <p>Local authorities\u2019 obligations with regard to children\u2019s social care have evolved gradually and unevenly, with the paroxysms of remorse following disasters such as the torture and murder of Victoria Climbi\u00e9 leading to big changes. Now, suddenly, long-established practice, such as the reliance on adoption panels to make life-changing decisions and requirements for criminal records checks, is being dissolved. But why? The Guardian has no wish to impugn the motives or capabilities of the children\u2019s minister, <a href=\"https://www.cypnow.co.uk/news/article/vicky-ford-appointed-children-and-families-minister\" title=\"\">Vicky Ford</a>, who made the changes after being in post for nine weeks. Given that they long predate her (identical moves to ditch six-monthly reviews were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/21/child-protection-law-averted-disaster-justine-greening\" title=\"\">abandoned by Justine Greening</a>), it seems clear that the deregulatory pressure comes from elsewhere.</p> <p>Children in foster placements and children\u2019s homes are already suffering disproportionately under the pandemic. They rely more on input from their teachers and other adults from whom they are now separated. In addition, many are used to regular meetings with birth parents or other relatives, including grandparents. In some cases the stopping of these this will be the cause of extreme distress.</p> <p>Police believe children are at increased risk of harm, including sexual abuse, during lockdown, and that crimes against them are going undetected (in normal times, teachers are the largest source of referrals). So far, child homicides do not appear to have risen in the way that homicides of women have, although in one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/27/neighbours-heard-woman-screaming-as-children-stabbed-in-london\" title=\"\">horrifying case</a>, two siblings aged under five have been killed. But this is the coldest possible comfort. Rarely has the lowly and disjointed nature of policymaking regarding children appeared more glaring. The pandemic must bring change. </p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 April 2020. A previous version referred to \u201cdiscussions\u201d between the DfE and Independent Children\u2019s Homes Association, but the ICHA has told the Guardian that these exchanges were limited to requests by the association for clarification on specific points. The article has been amended accordingly.</p>",

This marks a sharp rise from the official death toll up to 10 April, which was 1,043. From Wednesday, the government will publish daily figures for the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes and the community. This follows complaints for many weeks that by only publishing hospital deaths, figures could be underestimating the true number of deaths by as much as half, according to some estimates.<br></li> \n   <li>The Scottish government published new guidance recommending <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/sturgeon-urges-scots-to-wear-coronavirus-face-masks-for-shopping-and-travel\">the public should wear face coverings</a> in \u201climited circumstances\u201d where it was not always possible to remain two metres apart, for instance in supermarkets and on public transport. The UK government said it was still considering advice submitted on this issue submitted by Sage last week, which maintained there is \u201cweak\u201d evidence of face masks having a \u201csmall\u201d protective effect. The most important thing to maintain is physical distancing, it added.</li> \n   <li>British Airways is set to make up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">12,000 workers redundant</a> as the airline\u2019s parent company revealed its revenue had plunged 13% in the first quarter of 2020. Announcing the cuts, IAG said it expected recovery to 2019 passenger levels to take several years.</li> \n   <li>Eligibility for free coronavirus tests has been extended to NHS patients and staff who do not have symptoms, and care home residents and staff who do not have symptoms (those who do have symptoms qualify for tests already). Anyone over 65 with symptoms and anybody who needs to leave home to go to work who has symptoms, as well as members of their family, will also be eligible. </li> \n   <li>And the former prime minister Theresa May urged ministers to consider the impact of lockdown for domestic abuse and mental health, as well as the economy, when deciding how quickly to lift restrictions. Speaking in a debate on the domestic abuse bill, she said there was \u201cclear\u201d evidence that domestic abuse was increasing during lockdown because perpetrators have greater freedom to act and victims find it harder to leave. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side, thanks to all of you for following along and to everybody who got in touch with tips and suggestions.

(If they do have symptoms, they are already eligible.) And he said that people over 65 with symptoms, or people who need to travel for work and have symptoms, would be eligible too.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>After the Plague and the Great Fire, London was rebuilt by [the architect Christopher] Wren. In the decades after the second world war, London\u2019s manufacturing base dwindled to a fraction of its former self, and the Docks, the hub of the world\u2019s goods-trading economy were shuttered. But London was reborn as a city of services \u2013 financial, business, educational, creative, cultural, scientific, technological and more.</p> \n   <p>It seems unlikely that London, and cities like it, are about to disappear. But London may become a very different place from what it is now. A city where creative class or knowledge workers work from home as much as they commute to the office. Where the jostling for the best table in the restaurant takes place when booking online and not in the queue on the street. Where stadiums, art galleries and concert halls are redesigned to ensure public health along with entertainment and high culture. Where delivery vehicles are necessarily electric, and deliveries are grouped by algorithms and priced accordingly. Where pavements and public areas are widened to allow easy transition to social distancing, and where road space is recognised as a precious asset and charged for as such. Where the slow process of reimagining the high street gets speeded up. In this new London, centrality will retain both its allure and its economic benefits \u2013 but they will become relatively more expensive.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Scotland pavement widening is already on the agenda.

But as the country steamrolls into May, 500,000 diagnostic tests will represent \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d per day to capture most infected people and assuage Americans\u2019 concerns, said Jha, a threshold that still hasn\u2019t been reached on any single day so far.</p> <p>\u201cIdentifying who\u2019s infected, who\u2019s not is like public health, disease control 101. Without that, you\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Jha said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t test people for the virus, you cannot figure out who\u2019s infected, you can\u2019t keep them away from susceptible people, you can\u2019t run your economy.\u201d</p> <p>Not all states will necessarily be equally affected, as an outbreak\u2019s size drives testing needs, Jha said. In an analysis he and his team collaborated on with <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">Stat</a>, projections show that New York will require upwards of 100,000 more tests per day starting in May to catch most infected people in time. This despite the state\u2019s already impressive infrastructure, where <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data\">more people</a> have been tested than anywhere else in the US.</p> <p>Texas, on the other hand, has been disparaged for <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article242250436.html\">its lack of testing</a>. But Jha\u2019s analysis shows the state is actually <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">performing enough tests</a> for early May, if social distancing measures remain in place. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has instead announced that he will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/texas-reopening-may-1-coronavirus/index.html\">allow some businesses </a>to reopen on Friday, a move with unclear consequences.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the key about the virus, is any action you take today, you won\u2019t see the benefits or the costs for several weeks,\u201d Jha said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, antibody tests \u2013 once touted as a potential measurement for who could safely re-enter society after developing immunity to the disease \u2013 have taken on a lesser role as the country actually moves toward reopening. Such a minuscule proportion of the US population has been exposed to the virus, and false positives on immunity tests abound, Jha said. But perhaps even more significantly, there is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">no evidence</a>\u201d that recovered Covid-19 patients cannot get infected again, even if they have antibodies, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">wrote</a> on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us believe that having antibodies should be protective for most people, but that\u2019s a lot of caveats,\u201d said Jha. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we should make policy based on luck.\u201d</p>",

blocked by the Turnbull government in 2016. The Coalition argued he was not well suited for the role but a number of Labor MPs branded the decision as politically motivated.</p> \n<p>Over the past few weeks, Morrison has stepped up his calls for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/22/australian-pm-pushes-for-who-overhaul-including-power-to-send-in-investigators\">reform of the WHO</a>, including the power to send investigators into a country to determine the factors behind a disease outbreak, similar to weapon inspectors.</p> \n<p>Sharma said the whole international architecture relied on a level of intrusion into nations\u2019 sovereignty because countries appeared before UN bodies and accounted for themselves under treaty reporting mechanisms. Reforms to the WHO may involve states \u201closing a bit of their nation-state prerogative as part of that process\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo nations would have to be comfortable with that, but I can\u2019t think of many things that are more important than global public health in terms of a strategic interest that we\u2019d want to protect,\u201d Sharma said.</p>",
  "<p>Governments should not use taxpayer cash to rescue fossil fuel companies and carbon-intensive industries, but should devote economic rescue packages for the coronavirus crisis to businesses that cut greenhouse gas emissions and create green jobs, the UN secretary general has urged.</p> <p>\u201cWhere taxpayers\u2019 money is used to rescue businesses, it must be creating green jobs and sustainable and inclusive growth,\u201d said Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, speaking at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, a virtual meeting of more than 30 governments on the climate crisis, which concluded on Tuesday. \u201cIt must not be bailing out outdated, polluting, carbon-intensive industries.\u201d</p> <p>His call was echoed by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who led the meeting, which was also attended by the UK and China. \u201cThe coronavirus shows us that international cooperation is crucial and that the wellbeing of one nation always depends on the wellbeing of others,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be a difficult debate about the allocation of funds. But it is important that recovery programmes always keep an eye on the climate. We must not sideline climate, but invest in climate technologies.\u201d</p> <p>She confirmed German support within the EU for a target of cutting emissions by 50-55% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. The target is currently the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/eu-member-states-call-for-2030-climate-target\">subject of debate within the bloc</a>.</p> <p>Many countries are planning big investments in fossil fuel industries as part of their economic rescue packages. For instance, in the US the bailout of the airline industry is set to go ahead without conditions attached on their emissions, while the White House has moved to weaken a raft of environmental regulations. In China, subsidies for fossil fuel vehicles and the easing of permits for coalmining are also likely to raise emissions.</p> <p>While greenhouse gas emissions are set to fall this year, perhaps by as much as a tenth, any beneficial impact on the climate is likely to be short-lived and could quickly be outweighed by increased emissions if the economic recovery resumes on a high-carbon path. Low oil prices mean producers are running out of economic ways to store their excess.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4c907f37e7211025526e29da09af7f16f497089\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4c907f37e7211025526e29da09af7f16f497089/0_81_5204_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antonio Guterres is seen on a screen during the video conference of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is seen on a screen during the video conference of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Kappeler/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaigners and experts have been calling for economic rescue packages to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/24/covid-19-economic-rescue-plans-must-be-green-say-environmentalists\">directed towards environmentally sustainable ends</a> and for sectoral stimulus cash to come with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">green strings attached</a>.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, said: \u201cIt will be the duty of every responsible government to see that our economies are revived and rebuilt in a way that will stand the test of time. That means investing in industries and infrastructure that can turn the tide on climate change and doing all we can to boost resilience by shaping economies that can withstand everything nature throws at us.\u201d</p> <p>However, he failed to set out any measures on how the UK government would ensure that its rescue packages \u2013 for instance, those called for by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-airlines-call-for-multibillion-bailout-to-survive-covid-19-crisis\">airline</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/carmakers-accused-of-using-covid-19-weaken-environmental-laws\">car manufacturing industries</a> \u2013 were balanced with conditions that would ensure benefiting companies had to take action to reduce carbon use in the future.</p> <p>Richard Black, the director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said it was time for such measures. \u201cBacking for a clean recovery is now widespread, led by governments and major businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cFor actions to match rhetoric, concrete policies are going to be needed very soon \u2013 for example, the UK government delivering new policies that get the nation on track to its legally binding net-zero target, and making sure the world doesn\u2019t bounce back into high-polluting ways as soon as the lockdown eases.\u201d</p> <p>Guterres called for tougher action on cutting emissions, as well as more investment. \u201cPublic funds should invest in the future by flowing to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and climate. Fossil fuel subsidies must end, and carbon must have a price so polluters will pay for their pollution,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Guterres also called for developing countries to receive $100bn (\u00a382bn) a year, a longstanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/03/private-sector-climate-change-development-fund\">goal under the global climate negotiations</a>, to help them curb emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown, and he hinted at moves to reduce the debt on many developing countries, which has been mooted as a way to help them during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWe cannot allow the heavy and rising debt burden of developing countries to serve as a barrier to their ambition [on the climate],\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rich countries must all commit to zero-carbon emissions by 2050, added Guterres, with a particular nod to the US and China. \u201cThe Paris agreement was largely made possible by the engagement of the US and China. Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts will be doomed.\u201d</p> <p>Helen Clarkson, the chief executive of The Climate Group, a set of businesses accelerating action on the climate, said companies were still committed to climate action. \u201cWith the right green stimulus policies that ramp up investment in long-term sustainable solutions from electric transport to clean efficient energy, we can deliver on the goals of the Paris agreement without compromising on economic growth,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The UK will host global climate talks next year, after the UN\u2019s Cop26 summit had to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/we-must-use-this-time-well-climate-experts-hopeful-after-cop26-delay-coronavirus\">postponed from its original date of this November</a>.

  "<p>Ministers must relinquish their top-down control of the coronavirus epidemic after the lockdown to allow millions of people potentially infected with Covid-19 to be traced and supported by local teams in their own communities, say experts.</p> \n<p>Urgent discussions have begun between central government, local authorities and public health officials about the 18,000-strong army promised on Friday by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to help trace the contacts of people who test positive or have symptoms of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Hancock said they would be in place within three weeks but the Guardian understands that nobody has yet been recruited.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">UK contact-tracing plans: an NHS app and 18,000 health staff</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A letter to local authorities and other agencies on Friday, seen by the Guardian, said just 3,000 of these people would have public health expertise, while the other 15,000 would be call handlers.</p> \n<p>It is understood that ministers such as Hancock, who is enthusiastic about digital technology, hoped the NHS app would take much of the strain. The app is designed to warn people who have come into close contact with anyone who has Covid-19 to go into self-isolation.</p> \n<p>The government hoped that a high proportion of the population \u2013 up to 80% \u2013 would download the app on a smartphone. But in meetings, they have been advised that is unrealistic.

Apps are simply supports for contact tracing,\u201d said Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University. \u201cYou need people on old-fashioned things like telephones or going door to door and they need to be local teams because they need to understand the local communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>The whole system should be run by directors of public health and environmental health officers based in local authorities, with the resources they need, because they understand their community, she said.

Countries that continued to follow that plan, as urged by the World Health Organization (WHO), have had fewer deaths. They include Germany, Singapore and South Korea.</p> \n<p>The UK \u201cgave up very early\u201d, said Anthony Costello, a professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former WHO director. By 12 March, there had been 10 deaths and 590 confirmed cases, and about 3,500 contacts had been traced. But most of the cases were in London and the West Midlands. Continued testing, tracking and tracing could have kept the virus out of other regions and reduced deaths, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t stopped it on 12 March, our epidemic would have been much less.

  "<p>No 10 has promised \u201cmaximum transparency\u201d on its coronavirus response in the coming days. Here are just some of the areas where the government is under pressure to provide detailed answers \u2013 or risk being accused of a whitewash.</p> <h2>Sage</h2> <p>There are huge questions about the secrecy surrounding the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the crucial body advising Boris Johnson on the UK\u2019s coronavirus response. MPs, academics and medical professionals want a detailed list of who sits on it, their disciplines, minutes of its twice weekly meetings and, most importantly, more documents showing the basis on which they are making decisions about the lockdown.</p> <p>Five weeks ago, the government published a tranche of scientific papers showing the possible effects of the virus and social distancing measures. But nothing more has been forthcoming on the impact of the lockdown. The Guardian\u2019s publication last week of a list of many attendees, including the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser Dominic Cummings, fuelled calls for transparency. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has now promised that a membership list of participants would be published with their permission and the government also says it is planning to release more scientific papers in the coming days.</p> <h2>Lockdown exit strategy</h2> <p>Politicians from Tory grandees to opposition leaders are growing impatient with the government\u2019s refusal to set out an exit strategy. In particular, they have been pressing for information on the economic impact of the measures so far, what this means for wider public health, rising domestic abuse, child abuse, children\u2019s educational outcomes and other potential negative consequences.</p> <p>There was hope that the prime minister\u2019s return to Downing Street might mean a roadmap out of the lockdown is published this week, but No 10 suggests this is unlikely to happen until just before the review date of 7 May. Many ideas have been floated in the press on opening the economy \u2013 from friends and family bubbles and socially distanced schools to which sectors may be allowed to return to work first.</p> <p>However, No 10 is remaining officially tight-lipped about the options, insisting that the public supports a lockdown until the spread is suppressed and the risk of a second peak is reduced. Boris Johnson may, however, release some information about the current status of the spread of the virus and how much further the UK has to go before easing restrictions after a cabinet meeting on Thursday.</p> <h2>Death and infection numbers</h2> <p>It is still unclear how many people are dying of coronavirus, the exact age profile and the locations of hotspots. The main criticism is that the daily death toll from coronavirus published by the Department of Health and Social Care only includes hospital deaths and wide age brackets, after a 29-hour time lag.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics is now regularly releasing details for overall excess mortality with a few days\u2019 time lag, which gives a wider picture of deaths in the community, both directly and indirectly related to the coronavirus crisis. However, there are still no real-time figures for deaths in specific settings from confirmed or likely coronavirus, such as care homes and households. This is set to change, after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said daily deaths in care homes and the community would be published each day from Wednesday.</p> <p>There is also an incomplete picture of infection numbers because of the patchy situation with testing, with no widespread community monitoring. Some reports suggest there are still 350,000 infected people in the community but that is not an officially published figure.</p> <h2>PPE</h2> <p>Ministers have been repeating huge figures for distribution of PPE, saying a billion pieces have been sent out since the crisis began across tens of thousands of sites. But the BBC\u2019s Panorama accused the government of fiddling the numbers by counting each glove as an item, rather than pairs of gloves, and including paper towels and cleaning equipment, which are not protective clothing.</p> <p>Furthermore, No 10 has not come up with \u201cburn rate\u201d figures \u2013how much PPE is needed and being used each day \u2013 so the huge numbers for items distributed have no context. Labour has repeatedly pointed to the \u201cmismatch\u201d between ministers claiming there are no shortages and the situation on the ground, where medics complain of having to manufacture makeshift protection, reuse items or go without.<br></p> <h2>Testing</h2> <p>Ministers have been providing daily figures for testing capacity, actual tests, and people on whom tests have been performed. But they have failed to breakdown the types of people tested, including how many patients, care residents, hospital workers, care workers and other key workers are being tested and where in the country. Critics have asked for more information on why the number of tests being carried out do not match the capacity for testing, with many people unable or unwilling to travel for miles when unwell to drive-through testing centres.</p> <p>There is also ambiguity around the millions of antibody tests bought by the government, with a lack of clarity about how many different types are being tested, how much they cost, where they come from and how accurate they have proved so far. Ministers have been considering ordering a large batch from British developers of a test but there have been conflicting reports about whether they are reliable enough for home use.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Hancock announced a huge expansion of the eligibility criteria for coronavirus testing, with over-65s and those who work outside the home now able to get tested for coronavirus as long as they have symptoms. Moreover, tests will be available even without symptoms for all NHS staff, hospital patients, care home workers and their elderly residents. </p> <h2>Cygnus</h2> <p>The now-notorious Exercise Cygnus was a pandemic preparation project carried out four years ago, which showed the the UK was woefully underprepared for a global outbreak of a new virus. Whistleblowers revealed a huge number of shortcomings were identified including low stockpiles of PPE, not enough ventilators, and inadequate hospital capacity. However, ministers are refusing to declassify and publish the report, with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, claiming on Sunday that he could not remember whether he had seen it or not. Hancock insisted on Tuesday that he had received assurances from officials that \u201ceverything appropriate to do was done\u201d following the report\u2019s recommendations but there is still no commitment to see it published.</p> <h2>Face masks</h2> <p>The cabinet received advice last week from its scientists on Sage about whether it is effective for people to wear face masks to stop the spread of coronavirus but it is refusing to share the information or make recommendations as a result of the advice. The Scottish government advised on Tuesday that people should wear face masks in shops and on public transport. Questions are being asked about why No 10 is refusing to come to a decision when every day could be crucial in terms of stopping the further spread of the virus.</p>",

  "<p>If asked a month ago how the nation would celebrate the easing of the lockdown, I would never have imagined it would be with a trip to the council tip.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s a measure of how dramatically our horizons have shrunk that the heady prospect of dumping some rubbish, plus the chance of a socially distanced trip to the garden centre, can now be held out by ministers as a reward for six weeks of self-sacrifice. Nobody falls asleep at night dreaming of a chance to offload six weeks\u2019 worth of grass clippings. Yet after a month or more inside, some of us have learned to take our thrills where we can: a cup of tea in the sunshine, a phone call, a friendly word with the neighbours when putting out the bins. The happiest people in lockdown are those most capable of finding solace in small things, and it\u2019s this dramatic lowering of expectations under pressure that might help explain the baffling paradox in politics right now.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/boris-johnson-coronavirus-mug-britain-pm-cabinet\">Boris Johnson is tough on crime.

New evidence emerges daily, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52440641\">most recently in Monday night\u2019s Panorama</a>, of shortcomings in planning for an epidemic, and Britain\u2019s potentially catastrophic delay in imposing a lockdown means we lag painfully behind other European countries in emerging from it. Yet, somehow, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/boris-johnson-coronavirus-mug-britain-pm-cabinet\">blame slides off our prime minister</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/3cy7jestig/Results%20for%20Coronavirus%20Tracker%20GB%20-%20Wave%207_OMI235%20-%2024.04.2020_political%20(002).pdf\">60% of Britons</a> think that a government led by the man who missed five Cobra meetings about coronavirus has handled the epidemic well, according to YouGov, raising interesting questions about what might convince them things were going badly. Why?</p> <p>The obvious answer is that the left has always underestimated Johnson\u2019s natural rapport with voters, even after he won a Brexit referendum followed by a landslide general election, and is still doing so now. Not everyone is thinking what you\u2019re thinking, to put it simply: millions of Britons either still actively like Johnson, or are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Those who put him in Downing Street last December are particularly inclined not to judge him harshly, since that would be admitting they themselves made a terrible mistake; Conservative voters and leavers are significantly more likely than non-Conservatives and remain voters to approve of his handling of coronavirus. But that doesn\u2019t explain why a third of Labour voters, half of Liberal Democrat voters and 49% of remainers agree. </p> <p>One possible explanation is that Johnson\u2019s own near-death experience has been redemptive, encouraging those worried that he wasn\u2019t taking Covid-19 seriously enough to believe that he has changed. Government briefings have certainly done little to discourage the idea that intensive care turned him from a libertarian hawk into a more cautious dove.</p> <p>But another is that when asked to judge the government\u2019s strategy, people think first about their everyday experience of lockdown. Some are indeed suffering wretchedly, from the victims of domestic violence trapped with their abusers and families squashed into tiny flats, to the sacked, the evicted and the bereaved. But that still leaves a large silent mass of Britons, as yet untouched by the economic meltdown and so far coping better than expected.</p> <p>Whatever rightwing columnists say, the predicted great revolt hasn\u2019t materialised: a <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/the-three-groups-reacting-to-life-under-lockdown\">study by Kings College London</a> classed fewer than one in 10 Britons as \u201cresisters\u201d, actively fighting against it. Another 44% were classed as sufferers, people distressed by lockdown even if they felt it was necessary. But the biggest category were the \u201caccepters\u201d, people who were adapting surprisingly well and not losing sleep over it.</p> <p>Accepters are disproportionately middle-aged, so perhaps more likely to have accumulated the comforts that make lockdown more bearable \u2013 a garden, savings, a secure job that can be done from home \u2013 or simply more fearful that the virus might kill them if they went out. But I suspect many are also natural conformists, inclined to adapt rather than rage against their fate. How else to explain <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/04/27/britains-mood-slowly-starts-recover-covid-19?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=website_article&amp;utm_campaign=mood_tracker_2\">YouGov\u2019s extraordinary findings</a>, when tracking changes in the public mood, that happiness is rising again after plummeting at the start of lockdown, while stress and fear are declining after an early spike? Logically, the situation hasn\u2019t got any less frightening. Yet after the initial shock wears off, it seems some are adapting as humans have adapted throughout history to existential threat: by hunkering down, focusing on small pleasures, and resolutely blocking out the worst of it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/28/uk-coronavirus-live-news-minutes-silence-to-commemorate-key-workers-who-have-died\">UK coronavirus live: Scottish government advises people to cover faces in buses, trains and some shops</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accepters, the King\u2019s College study found, spent significantly less time than others thinking about the virus. They\u2019re the people taking things one day at a time instead of worrying about tomorrow, keeping busy by clearing out the loft or weeding the garden, turning off the news because it\u2019s depressing \u2013 or if they do listen, getting annoyed with journalists who ask upsetting questions about doctors dying. Their positivity helps them cope, but also makes them slow to question authority. They\u2019ll be dangerously open to the defence Johnson is now apparently trying to build ahead of any public inquiry, that is that this was an unprecedented global crisis in which everyone made mistakes but he nonetheless did his best. (Monday\u2019s comeback speech focused on the fact that the NHS has thankfully not been overwhelmed \u2013 as if that was the sole measure of success. It felt like a taste of arguments to come.)</p> <p>Whether that defence succeeds in the long term depends on whether accepters stay accepting, or are tipped by what may be a brutal coming recession into becoming sufferers. But no opposition to Johnson will succeed unless it first understands why, whatever happens, so many people want so badly to believe in him.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

The high court last year ruled the scheme \u2013 which obliges private landlords to check the immigration status of tenants and prospective tenants, with the risk of five years in prison if they get it wrong \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/01/right-to-rent-scheme-ruled-incompatible-with-human-rights-law\">to be racially discriminatory</a>.</p> <p>Whatever its intention, what the law did in practice was encourage many landlords to withhold places to live from anyone who carried the potential for trouble under the act. The high court had ruled the measure unfair, saying it had \u201clittle to no effect\u201d on controlling immigration and that it flew in the face of human rights laws guaranteeing freedom from discrimination. That seemed sensible.</p> <p>Enter the appeal court, considering a cry of foul from a government that talks of the hostile environment as if it were a relic of the past while simultaneously keeping its strictures in place. The appeal court accepted that, under this law, some landlords did indeed discriminate against would-be tenants who had no British passport \u2013 as is the case with 17% of British nationals in England and Wales. That in itself was a victory for those such as the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) who opposed the scheme. But the appeal court judges dismissed the view of the high court and ruled the scheme, for all its problems, \u201cjustified\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d. They used legalese language but, basically, their conclusion was: \u201cHey, bad stuff happens.\u201d</p> <p>No law is perfect. But how can it be right to legally bolster a scheme so palpably open to abuse against such a significant section of lawfully entitled residents and British citizens? Are they, despite human rights law that is supposed to protect them, to be seen as collateral damage by ministers stuck in the mindset that caused the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a>? Indeed the very people affected by that scandal, those unable to fully document their legitimate status, are the ones who could be made to suffer all over again when landlords deny them a place to live.</p> <p>The judges took the literal view that the legislation as written does not instruct landlords to discriminate. \u201cDiscrimination is not sanctioned under this scheme,\u201d they said. They were comforted by Home Office assurances that the checks landlords must take \u2013 sight of variables such as passports, ID cards, driving licences and letters from government departments \u2013 were not excessively onerous, and that landlords were told of the \u201cneed to treat all tenants equally\u201d. Meanwhile, they were told, empathetic officials helped vulnerable people meet the requirements. And to all that, the judges nodded agreement.</p> <p>But would any reasonable person, knowing the Home Office\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/27/home-office-windrush-report-damns-hostile-environment-policy\">hostile environment record</a>, accept these as realistic safeguards against discrimination? </p> <p>In fact the judgment noted evidence provided by the Residential Landords Association indicating that under this law, 5-6% of landlords discriminated against potential tenants who did not have British passports \u2013 and that the \u201cevidence of likely intent produces a figure of over 40%\u201d. But hey, bad stuff happens.</p> <p>Migrants legitimately seeking homes may suffer discrimination, judges said. But the discrimination is \u201centirely coincidental\u201d. The government and its legislation can\u2019t be blamed if people don\u2019t obey. Yet that is, of course, to dismiss the impact of discrimination on those who bear the brunt of it. And, as we know, people will often abuse bad law.</p> <p>And so ministers have their victory. As things stand, a bit of discrimination is acceptable. \u201cI am delighted,\u201d crowed the junior immigration minister Chris Philp.</p> <p>Thankfully, our system still has safeguards. The JCWI says it will refer the matter to the supreme court. So there is still a chance to draw a line in the sand, and to declare there is no level of acceptable discrimination. </p> <p>Yes, bad stuff happens. But it\u2019s no basis for public policy.</p> <ul> <li><p>Hugh Muir is a senior assistant G1 editor</p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>NHS app</h2> \n<p>The NHS CV19 app will enable the public to report their symptoms and order a swab test online if available. The NHS has chosen to go with its own model rather than one proposed by Apple and Google, and hopes it will be ready in two to three weeks, though the timetable for rollout is unclear.</p> \n<p>Once someone installs the app, it will start logging the distance between the user\u2019s phone and others nearby that also have the app installed, using Bluetooth Low Energy. This anonymous log of how close they are to others will be stored securely on their phone, according to a letter to local authorities and public health directors from Public Health England.</p> \n<p>If they become unwell with symptoms of Covid-19, they can choose to let the app inform the NHS. That will trigger an anonymous alert to other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days. Those users will get an alert telling them they have been close to someone with the virus. It may advise them to self-isolate.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-39025ieC0JMcyiyM/\" data-alt=\"contact tracing\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-39025ieC0JMcyiyM/\">contact tracing</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>Testing</h2> \n<p>Although Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, claims we are on track for 100,000 tests a day by Thursday, the latest figures for 26 April show only 37,000 tests carried out. </p> \n<p>There is no plan to test all contacts of people who have the virus. Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s modelling team at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said in their latest report on 23 April that \u201ctesting of contacts would require substantial test numbers and significant investment of laboratory and staff resources\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-testing\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-testing&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-testing</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There were 15,000 calls from people reporting potential Covid-19 symptoms every day to the NHS 111 helpline between 18 March and 16 April. Testing them and three contacts each, assuming a low number because of the lockdown, would require 60,000 tests to be done every day. So they are all likely to be told to self-isolate without testing.</p> \n<h2>Contact tracers</h2> \n<p>Hancock has talked of recruiting 18,000 contact tracers, but the scheme is still evolving, with input from regional directors of public health. Of these, the government has proposed 15,000 should be call handlers, so only 3,000 would be trained public health staff including environmental health officers and probably sexual health staff with experience of contact tracing and knowledge of their communities.</p> \n<p>In early April, the government was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/uk-missed-coronavirus-contact-tracing-opportunity-experts-say\">missing an opportunity</a> after it failed to deploy 5,000 experienced contact tracing experts employed by councils to help limit the spread of coronavirus. According to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, the UK has at least 5,000 environmental health officers working in local councils nationwide but Public Health England said at the time it would use its own local health protection teams.</p>",
  "<p><br>Three days before the UK went into lockdown and the world changed beyond all recognition, I had to catch a train from London to Edinburgh with my six-year-old autistic son, two-year-old daughter and partner. We were travelling back to Scotland a week later than planned after a harrowing visit with my parents. My mother, who has metastatic breast cancer, had ended up in intensive care just as the first UK deaths from coronavirus were being announced. She was still in hospital when we left. Now, somehow, I needed to make the magical transformation from daughter to mother, get my head in gear and get my children home before the journey I had been routinely making for 20 years became, at worst, impossible or, at best, freighted with risk.</p> <p>Two days earlier, my partner had tried to take him home to give me a little more time with my mum, but at King\u2019s Cross he had a meltdown and refused to get on the train. It is perhaps one of the great understatements of my life to say that my nerves were jangling.</p> <p>The usual questions replayed on a loop composed by anxiety. Would he get in the taxi or run away? (He would get in the taxi.) Would he be able to cope with the sensory overload of the platforms at King\u2019s Cross? (Yes.) Would there be time to grab a coffee and sandwich? (Of course not.) Now, suddenly, there was a new strain of questions. Would the train be too busy for us to keep our distance from other passengers? Would there be handwash in the toilets, and would we be able to get our son to use it? And when we got home, would we be able to get the handful of foods he eats or would the Birds Eye Chicken Dippers have been emptied from Tesco?</p> <p>We families of autistic children are a resilient bunch. We have learned the high art of appearing calm as we work our arses off to make this noisy, intolerant and unpredictable world habitable for our children. We are like the people who paint the rooms before the Queen enters them, forever one step ahead of our little rulers, trying to make their passage through life smoother, better, happier. We are fighters. And it turns out these skills are extremely handy in a global pandemic.</p> <p>Self-isolation is, for many families, an overdramatic descriptor of daily life. Physical distancing often comes with the territory. My son used to have a habit of screaming, \u201cSAY GOODBYE!\u201d to any friend I ran in to on the street until I had no choice but to carry out his orders. Don\u2019t get me wrong. He loves people, but he needs to know when they\u2019re coming.</p> <p>His passions before the pandemic were school, a special-needs family swimming session every Saturday, watching the trains from a nearby McDonald\u2019s car park with a McFlurry and chips, the play park, the local ice-cream shop and going to visit \u201cAjji and Tata\u201d (my parents) in London. None of this is possible now. And like many autistic people, my son struggles with change and chronology. So according to neurotypical reasoning, life under lockdown would be especially hard for him. This is why it\u2019s a relief that the UK coronavirus rules have been relaxed for people with autism and learning disabilities, which means families like ours can leave our homes for exercise more than once a day and travel beyond our local area if necessary. And sometimes, for us, it is. My son might be pro-physical distancing as a rule of thumb, but he doesn\u2019t know how to keep two metres apart from anyone. He has a deep sensory love of running his body and hands along railings and walls. The world is now a minefield.</p> <p>Yet he is coping brilliantly. New routines have been laid down, quickly and organically. Every day he scoots three circuits of our local park with his \u201cbabuga\u201d (our son\u2019s name for his other mother: its etymological root is \u201cbike\u201d\u2026 don\u2019t ask). He doesn\u2019t notice people wearing masks, perhaps because he struggles with facial recognition, perhaps because this simply isn\u2019t the way his brain identifies humans. In the morning, we act out The Tiger Who Came to Tea in his bedroom (his sister is daddy, I\u2019m the tiger, my son, naturally, is EVERYONE). In the afternoon he jumps up and down on our coal box, and we shout at him ineffectually. He says hello to Ajji and Tata on the phone: my mother is back at home thanks to the everyday miracle of NHS social care we are only now beginning to acknowledge. There is screen time, the building of train tracks and ceaseless reciting of the alphabet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His autistic logic results in a Zen-like acceptance of our new reality that no mindfulness course could teach</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I wouldn\u2019t call any of it home-schooling exactly, unless doing a roly-poly on to a cherry tomato is on the curriculum, but his progress continues at its own idiosyncratic and spellbinding pace. And witnessing the flowering of my son\u2019s relationship with his sister has been one of the happiest experiences of my life. As well as being deeply challenging, lockdown is a tender lesson in what really matters not just to my son but to all small children. Home. The family unit. A cup of popcorn on the sofa in front of Paddington 2. The little things. We never did big birthday parties or trips to the museum so this collective simplifying of our days is already familiar to us. What\u2019s amazing is not how much is lost, but how much is gained when restrictions are imposed upon us.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go back to school on \u2026 Monday? Tuesday?\u201d This is what my son says every day, though it\u2019s unclear if he is genuinely asking or just likes the repetition of the days of the week. The point is he\u2019s fine with it. School is closed. It would be impossible for him to go until it\u2019s open again. And that\u2019s that. His autistic logic results in a Zen-like acceptance of our new reality that no mindfulness course could teach. Meanwhile, my neurotypical two-year-old is asking why people are wearing masks. Fear of the world beyond our front gate is creeping in. The other day, she breathed a sigh of relief when we turned on to an empty street and said softly from her buggy: \u201cIt\u2019s nice and quiet here.\u201d</p> <p>One of the paradoxes of lockdown in a city is the horizons that have broadened overnight. Our street now has the requisite WhatsApp group filled with everyday gallantry and pledges to hold a street party once this is all over. I told this group my son is autistic and favours a particular brand of margherita pizza if anyone spotted one. A neighbour, whom I probably still wouldn\u2019t recognise if I saw her, promptly delivered two large pizzas to our doorstep and refused payment, saying her nephew was autistic and had a similarly restricted diet. The following week another pizza appeared from \u201cNo 18\u201d. I don\u2019t think any of them knew our son was autistic before this crisis. They probably saw him careering down our street barefoot or loudly reciting the numbers on their front door in his phase when he had to \u201cdo my numbers\u201d before coming home. Perhaps they drew their own conclusions. Now they know they are responding not just with kindness but pizzas. And disclosures of their own.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my son continues to meet the precariousness of life with courage, humour and idiosyncrasy. In my admittedly limited and neurotypical experience, lockdown is both harder and easier for him than I might have expected. Not that I have many expectations. Another skill acquired from parenting my son \u2013 and no one on this ravaged planet has taught me more than this particular six-year-old boy \u2013 is to expect nothing beyond having every single one of your assumptions challenged. There may be no going back to how things were, but there is no going forward either. According to my son\u2019s watertight logic, now is the only place to be.</p>",
  "<p>\u201cThe garden seduces me,\u201d says Ron Finley, who is known around the world as the \u201cgangsta gardener\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ll get out there at 9am and next thing I know it\u2019s 7pm \u2026 gardening takes your mind off things. Everybody should have a garden to cultivate.\u201d </p> \n<p>English horticulturalists fiddling with well-maintained roses might know the feeling. But for Finley, gardening isn\u2019t about producing the perfect floral pom-pom, it\u2019s about growing people. Planting is his unusual form of protest, and having a garden stuffed full of beautiful plants and vegetables is a byproduct of that.</p> \n<p>To many, this will seem a surprising way to rebel, but Finley lives in what he calls a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/video/2019/nov/20/theres-food-its-just-not-real-food-inside-americas-hunger-capital-video\">\u201cfood prison\u201d</a>.

All over the world, seed suppliers are running out of stock \u2013 when it comes to panic-buying, carrot and courgette seeds are the new toilet roll. Even live chicken sales have spiked. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/apr/09/the-good-life-box-set\">The Good Life</a> is back in fashion.</p> \n<p>For most people self-sufficiency will always remain a dream, but that hasn\u2019t stopped improbable gardens sprouting up in windowboxes, back yards and balconies since lockdown. \u201cGardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do \u2026 There are so many metaphors in that garden \u2013 we\u2019re cultivating ourselves, we\u2019re learning how to take care of things, we\u2019re learning that nothing is instantaneous,\u201d says Finley.</p> \n<p>His first act of defiance came in 2010 when he dug up a strip of land between his house and the street and started planting fruit and vegetables, including pumpkin, kale and sunflowers. \u201cI got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn\u2019t impregnated with pesticides.

  "<p>It was 2.30am when Daniel Jim\u00e9nez was woken by his neighbour\u2019s screams. When he went outside his home in the Los Pajarillos neighbourhood of Valladolid in north-west Spain, he saw a woman hanging from a third-storey window. Another neighbour rushed out with mattresses to help break her fall but he was too late. She fell to her death.</p> <p>Although the investigation into the 56-year-old woman has proved inconclusive, the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, initially declared it a crime of gender violence.</p> <p>The Valladolid case aside, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-03-27/cronologia-de-victimas-mortales-de-violencia-de-genero-de-2020.html\">18 women have been murdered in Spain this year</a> by partners or ex-partners, making a grim total of 1,051 since 2003, when such crimes began to be recorded separately. Two have happened since Spain\u2019s strict lockdown came into force on 14 March.

With no one allowed out except to buy food or medicine, women living with abusive partners have little chance to escape a situation made even more fraught by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In the first two weeks of April alone there was a 47% increase in calls to Spain\u2019s domestic violence helpline over the same period last year. The number of women contacting support services, which have been designated as essential by the government, by email or on social media is said to have increased by as much as 700%.</p> <p>But there has been a sharp drop in complaints being made to the police.</p> <p>Ana Bella, a survivor of abuse who founded the <a href=\"https://www.fundacionanabella.org/en/\">Fundaci\u00f3n Ana Bella </a>to fight gender violence, said that in order to bring a formal complaint, women need the support of family and people around them and isolation is making this more difficult.</p> <p>\u201cBut the greatest barrier to reporting abuse is the emotional ties we have with the perpetrator,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only crime where the victim doesn\u2019t want revenge but just to live in peace. It\u2019s very difficult to report the father of your children to the police. Many women feel guilty because they\u2019re going to send their children\u2019s father to prison.\u201d</p> <p>Mar\u00eda \u00c1ngeles Carmona, president of the government agency dealing with gender violence, believes the drop in police reports can be partly attributed to restrictions on freedom of movement. \u201cAround 30% of police complaints are about breaking restraining orders, but under the lockdown no one is allowed to leave their home,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added that many of the calls to the national helpline were about shared custody of children and visiting rights under the lockdown, but agreed that enforced confinement was inevitably heightening tensions in the home.</p> <p>Her department has published <a href=\"http://www.violenciagenero.igualdad.gob.es/informacionUtil/covid19/GuiaVictimasVGCovid19.pdf\">an online guide</a> with advice on who to call for emergency, legal and psychological aid, or simply to talk, as well as what to do if someone has been threatened or is in danger.</p> <p>In the Canary Islands, where a 78-year-old woman was murdered in March by her husband, a scheme has been introduced to help women who might not be able to get away from an abusive partner for long enough to get help. A woman can simply go into a chemist and request a Mascarilla-19 face mask, the pharmacist then knows to call for help. The scheme has since been extended to other regions in Spain and beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2babfb4ec2de29cd7b820ebe75a88fe8cfe99bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2babfb4ec2de29cd7b820ebe75a88fe8cfe99bf/0_0_1200_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scheme called Mascarilla-19 has been set up to allow women alert pharmacists to call for help on their behalf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scheme called Mascarilla-19 has been set up to allow women alert pharmacists to call for help on their behalf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gender violence has a high profile in Spain but Bella said this is unlikely to be because rates are worse than other countries but because there has been a concerted effort to raise public and government awareness.</p> <p>According to the EU\u2019s gender equality index devised in 2017, Spain scored betteron gender violence than France, Denmark, the UK and the EU average, but scored worse than most on failure to disclose, suggesting that reported cases are only the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>\u201cSpain is a pioneer in the fight against gender violence,\u201d Carmona said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first country to make it an issue of state, with specific legislation dating from 2004 and supported by all parliamentary parties in 2017. We\u2019re a model for other countries, some of which don\u2019t even keep official statistics of murdered women.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past couple of years, Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party has led a backlash against women\u2019s rights, calling for laws intended to protect women to be repealed on the grounds that they discriminate against men.</p> <p>\u201cSpain is one of the most advanced countries in gender equality and this is unstoppable, whatever Vox says,\u201d Bella said. \u201cThey want to dilute gender violence into what they call family violence. There are women who mistreat others, of course. But it\u2019s not the same as the unequal power relationship between a man and a woman.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re sufficiently mature as a society not to regress after all we\u2019ve gone through to get here.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2020 to change the number of femicides that have happened since 14 March; to edit some of the information regarding the Valladolid incident; and to correct the location of Valladolid within Spain.</p>",

  "<p>Given that we are housebound amid a global crisis, you may think that a short back and sides would be the last thing on anyone\u2019s mind. But you would be wrong. Physical distancing has not stopped people around the world, from Phillip Schofield to Malala Yousafzai, reaching for the scissors \u2013 with varying degrees of success.</p> <p>Since the temptation to give yourself, or your loved ones and housemates, a quick cut appears matched only by the desire to bake banana bread, here are a few points to consider.</p> <h2>Should you cut your own hair?</h2> <p>Hairdressers advise regular appointments to keep your hair in good condition and your cuts looking fresh, so it is little wonder that so many of us are keen to keep this up. But most stylists have one word of advice: don\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI feel sorry for all the stylists who, after this, will be dealing with a lot of DIY disasters,\u201d says Keri Daniel, the owner of Danique Hairdressing in Leicester. \u201cIf you really have to, then it\u2019s worth investing in the right tools \u2013 even a professional would struggle to get a good result using the kitchen scissors. You can get cheap hairdressing scissors and cutting combs online \u2013 even razors \u2013 and they\u2019ll give you a better finish.\u201d</p> <h2>What about fringes?</h2> <p>Being poked in the eye by your own fringe is no fun. Many fringe-wearers will have already experimented with DIY trims, but, if you are new to this, the advice is to cut upwards, not across, using just the tips of the scissors. Daniel goes further: \u201cI\u2019d suggest using a wide-tooth comb, pulling the hair down to the eyebrows and then lifting it slightly [before cutting]. Any lifting of the fringe will give it a slight graduation and make it look softer. This way, even if you do make a mistake, it\u2019s unlikely to look horrific.\u201d</p> <h2>Should you just shave it all off?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0a2765428fcc35b62fee2c699c10a161e595873\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0a2765428fcc35b62fee2c699c10a161e595873/0_0_1080_1349/801.jpg\" alt=\"The Riz Ahmed look.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Riz Ahmed look.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @rizahmed/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With hairdressers and barbers closed, some people \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/30/locks-down-shaving-hair-buzzcuts-coronavirus-craze\">Riz Ahmed</a> and David Beckham among them \u2013 have opted to simply lop off the lot. It is quite the lockdown look, but it is not as simple as you might hope.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to make sure that the guard you put on the clipper is secured properly \u2013 otherwise you can go from a grade four to a grade zero by accident, and there\u2019s no fading that out,\u201d says the salon owner and celebrity stylist Jamie Stevens. \u201cYou may think you can just do grade three all over, but the parietal bridge and the occipital bone [towards the back of the head] protrude slightly, and a few days later it will start to have a weird shape because these areas should be slightly tapered.\u201d</p> <h2>Should you do it yourself or hand the scissors to someone you live with?</h2> <p>\u201cThink about what\u2019s best for your household, because you have to live with these people,\u201d warns Daniel. Like most professionals, hairdressers have a knack of making their job look easier than it is.</p> <p>\u201cIf you cut your own hair, you\u2019ll need one mirror in front and one behind you,\u201d says Stevens. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people using their phones, but it gets a bit tricky because you need to hold that, the comb, the scissors and the clippers. Get help if you can.\u201d</p> <h2>How do you cut kids\u2019 hair?</h2> <p>\u201cThe biggest challenge when cutting children\u2019s hair is that they don\u2019t like to sit still,\u201d says Kelly V, the owner of Pixal-Rose Hair Design, a vegan salon in Swindon,<strong> </strong>who suggests keeping them occupied with a tablet or a book. For short hair, a simple cut with clippers is advised. For long hair, \u201cbrush the hair down, have the head tilted forward and cut the very, very ends off\u201d, she says. \u201cDon\u2019t attempt anything too drastic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b054768ec848ed402c3a09a9a126785c3cc41e60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b054768ec848ed402c3a09a9a126785c3cc41e60/0_81_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You can do it, Dad!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can do it, Dad!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anchiy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What about your roots?</h2> <p>This can be the biggest giveaway that you are overdue a trip to the salon, but there are better solutions than home-dyeing.</p> <p>\u201cA zigzag parting can help disguise that regrowth line and, depending on the colour of your hair, mascara can be a great way to cover up greys,\u201d says Stevens. \u201cOr just have a bit of fun \u2013 we put a luminous green feather in one parting. It looked like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish\">Billie Eilish</a>\u2019s green roots.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly V says the biggest problem with DIY dyeing is when those with blond hair switch to brunette to avoid root regrowth. \u201cThe trend is to go for ashy, cool, brunette colours, but this will simply leave your blond hair khaki,\u201d she says. Instead, \u201cyou\u2019ll need to select a dye that contains a lot of red tones [to get the colour you want]. Also, always do the patch test.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel suggests visiting your salon\u2019s website to find out which products they used and investing in those. \u201cYou may be able to buy them through the salon, which can be a great way to support them while they are closed,\u201d she adds. \u201cDyes that you might buy in the supermarket are not professional products, and it can make it a lot harder when it comes to colouring in the future.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2ead3405c2e803a8362c7c2f7dee625ccb76013\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2ead3405c2e803a8362c7c2f7dee625ccb76013/37_0_3462_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Billie Eilish roots-hiding technique.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Billie Eilish roots-hiding technique.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic,</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How should you care for afro hair?</h2> <p>\u201cAn inch of growth in afro hair doesn\u2019t make as much difference,\u201d says Stevens, whose salon specialises in afro hair. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to disguise that it\u2019s overdue a cut. Relaxed hair will have curly roots, but I would never recommend using a home relaxant \u2013 you will get snappage. You could go through it with straightening irons, but it would be very time-consuming. I would suggest just wearing your hair up.\u201d</p> <h2>What if you run out of shampoo and conditioner and can\u2019t get to the shops?</h2> <p>Join the \u201cno-poo\u201d movement and break free from the shackles of commercial haircare! Well, it is one option \u2013 and the lockdown offers a chance to wait out the initial greasy period in relative privacy. Otherwise, shower gel can substitute for shampoo if you are desperate, according to Stevens, while mayonnaise, avocado or coconut oil can replace conditioner. \u201cIf you look at what branded products use in their ingredients, you can get an idea of the kitchen cupboard alternatives,\u201d says Daniel. Of course, you are probably washing your hair far more than you need to anyway.</p> <h2>How often do you need to bother washing your hair when no one can see?</h2> <p>\u201cRealistically, you don\u2019t need to wash your hair more than once a week, unless you are doing a sport or have a job in a kitchen,\u201d says Daniel. For those of us who like to wash our hair daily, this may seem like a big ask. But she assures me it is possible. \u201cOn the third day, you could spritz it with some water and blow-dry again to give it a bit of lift. Stay away from the straighteners if you can. On the fourth day, you can start to wear your hair up. Dry shampoo and texture sprays can also give unwashed hair a little bit more life. You\u2019re with your family and loved ones, staying home \u2013 it\u2019s the best chance to give your hair a rest.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbdb0b07319bb5de5f6776a34d3fbbbf556d6eb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbdb0b07319bb5de5f6776a34d3fbbbf556d6eb6/0_186_5700_3420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Go for shaving rather than attempting home waxing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Go for shaving rather than attempting home waxing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Source/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What about body hair \u2013 is it time to grow it out?</h2> <p>Removal of body hair \u2013 particularly pubic hair \u2013 is often best left to the professionals. While shaving your own legs may be straightforward, waxing your bikini line is another matter. So, is it time to go au naturel? \u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of inquiries from clients who are midway through laser hair removal courses asking what they should do,\u201d says Dr Chlo\u00eb Butler, the founder of the Chlo\u00eb Edit clinic in Worcestershire. \u201cWe advise not attempting DIY waxing, as it can be quite tricky unless you have the right equipment and patience.\u201d While trimming or shaving pubic hair may seem straightforward, Butler believes some people would be better off leaving well alone. You may even discover you prefer your new look.</p> <p>\u201cMake the right choice based on the type of skin and hair you have, not on whatever style is \u2018trending\u2019,\u201d says Butler. \u201cIf you have a thicker hair follicle, you may be more prone to ingrown hairs or a shaving rash. If you\u2019ve got oily skin, you may get blocked pores and irritation. Dry skin tends to be thinner and more likely to tear.\u201d Ouch.</p> <h2>Is now a good time to experiment with hairstyles?</h2> <p>Rather than shaving your head, Stevens suggests men try growing their hair long or cultivating a beard. If you are tempted by a complete restyle, he suggests ordering a wig online: \u201cWalk around the house and see how you feel. What kind of reaction do you get when you\u2019re FaceTiming friends and family?\u201d</p> <p>Daniel believes that, aside from the buzzcut, other hair trends are likely to emerge after the lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting from a hairdressing point of view. People who wanted to grow out their grey hair, or go from being very blond to a more natural colour, have an opportunity to do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUltimately, chill out,\u201d says Stevens. \u201cEmbrace your new hair and, if you\u2019re really that bothered, put a hat or a scarf on.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A new Michael Moore-produced documentary that takes aim at the supposed hypocrisy of the green movement is \u201cdangerous, misleading and destructive\u201d and should be removed from public viewing, according to an assortment of climate scientists and environmental campaigners.</p> <p>The film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/22/planet-of-the-humans-review-environment-michael-moore-jeff-gibbs\">Planet of the Humans</a>, was released on the eve of Earth Day last week by its producer, Michael Moore, the baseball cap-wearing documentarian known for Fahrenheit 9/11 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/15/artsfeatures4\">Bowling for Columbine</a>. Describing itself as a \u201cfull-frontal assault on our sacred cows\u201d, the film argues that electric cars and solar energy are unreliable and rely upon fossil fuels to function. It also attacks figures including Al Gore for bolstering corporations that push flawed technologies over real solutions to the climate crisis.</p> <p>Planet of the Humans has provoked a furious reaction from scientists and campaigners, however, who have called for it be taken down. Films for Action, an online library of videos, temporarily took down the film after <a href=\"https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/michael-moore-presents-planet-of-the-humans/\">describing it as \u201cfull o</a><a href=\"https://www.filmsforaction.org/watch/michael-moore-presents-planet-of-the-humans/\">f misinformation\u201d</a>, though they later reinstated it, saying they did not want accusations of censorship to give the film \u201cmore power and mystique than it deserves\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk11vI-7czE\">A free version on YouTube </a> has been viewed more than 3m times.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshfoxfilm/status/1253572812591247360/photo/2\">letter</a> written by Josh Fox, who made the documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/13/gasland-review\">Gasland</a>, and signed by various scientists and activists, has urged the removal of \u201cshockingly misleading and absurd\u201d film for making false claims about renewable energy. Planet of the Humans \u201ctrades in debunked fossil fuel industry talking points\u201d that question the affordability and reliability of solar and wind energy, the letter states, pointing out that these alternatives are now cheaper to run than fossil fuels such as coal.</p> <p>Michael Mann, a climate scientist and signatory to Fox\u2019s letter, said the film includes \u201cvarious distortions, half-truths and lies\u201d and that the filmmakers \u201chave done a grave disservice to us and the planet by promoting climate change inactivist tropes and talking points.\u201d The film\u2019s makers did not respond to questions over whether it will be pulled down.</p> <p>Planet of the Humans has been shown at Moore\u2019s Traverse City film festival, where the producer said it was \u201cperhaps the most urgent film we\u2019ve shown in the 15-year history of our film festival\u201d. Jeff Gibbs, who wrote and directed the film, has suggested that unrestrained economic and population growth should be the target of environmentalists\u2019 efforts rather than technological fixes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/18/michael-moore-we-have-the-power-to-crush-trump-fahrenheit-11-9\">Michael Moore: 'We have the power to crush Trump'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Climate activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/20/climate-crisis-its-now-or-never-to-avert-catastrophe\">Bill McKibben</a>, one of the targets for the film for allegedly being influenced by corporate money and for supporting the burning of biomass such as wood chips for energy, said the characterisations are untrue. McKibben has previously changed his views on biomass energy, which he now sees as being detrimental to climate action, and claims he has \u201cnever taken a penny in pay\u201d from any environmental group.</p> <p>\u201cI am used to ceaseless harassment and attack from the fossil fuel industry, and I\u2019ve done my best to ignore a lifetime of death threats from rightwing extremists,\u201d McKibben said. \u201cIt does hurt more to be attacked by others who think of themselves as environmentalists.\u201d</p> <p>Renewable energy has long been portrayed as expensive and unreliably intermittent by oil and gas companies and their lobby groups, which have spent several decades questioning the veracity of climate science and undermining efforts to radically reduce planet-heating emissions.</p> <p>In fact, the technology used for wind and solar energy has improved markedly in recent years, while the costs have plummeted. While electric cars often require fossil fuel-generated energy to produce them and provide the electricity to fuel them, <a href=\"https://theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/EV-life-cycle-GHG_ICCT-Briefing_09022018_vF.pdf\">research has shown</a> they still emit less greenhouse gas and air pollutants over their lifetime than a standard petrol or diesel car. <br><br>Generating all power from renewables will take significant upgrades of grid infrastructure and storage but several researchers have <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/CountriesWWS.pdf\">declared the goal feasible</a>, most likely with carbon-capture technology for remaining fossil fuel plants. Scientists say the world must reach net zero emissions by 2050 to head off disastrous global heating, which would likely spur worsening storms, heatwaves, sea level rise and societal unrest.</p>",

Coronaviruses are a large family of them which may cause illness in animals or humans. , 2:A - The virus itself is called Sars-CoV-2. The disease it causes in humans is named Covid-19. WHO guidelines advise against naming diseases after geographical regions or specific animals, to avoid stigmatisation. This is why it was controversial when some world leaders insisted on referring to Covid-19 as the 'Chinese virus' or 'Wuhan flu' after the city where it was first encountered, 3:C - The 19 is a designation of when the virus was identified, 4:C - The WHO website states: 'Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets Covid-19 becomes seriously ill'. However, this number can, of course, only be calculated using the information that we have on the number of people who have tested positive, so it may not be accurate if there are large numbers of infected but untested people in the population., 5:C - Blurred vision is not listed by the WHO as a symptom. However, it does appear that the coronavirus can affect the human senses - many people who have had the illness have reported losing their sense of taste and/or smell., 6:B - Soap loosens the lipids in the virus membrane, causing its structure to collapse and making the virus inactive. Alcohol-based hand sanitiser is still useful for removing the virus if soap and warm water is unavailable, but it is not as effective, 7:B - That's tiny, to say the least. , 8:C - When virus-ridden particles are inhaled they come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors \u2013 known as Ace-2 receptors \u2013 on their surfaces and the virus locks on to these, 9:A - RNA is found in nature as a single strand folded on to itself, rather than a paired double strand like DNA, 10:A - Yes, it has been detected on a surface up to three days after initial contamination according to one study - and as long as seven days according to another. That's why it is important to keep washing your hands, and to avoid touching your face as much as possible, 11:C - Correct. Ebola is not caused by a type of coronavirus. Sars is a pneumonia-like coronavirus that first emerged in 2002. Eight months later it had resulted in 8,098 cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries. Mers developed in 2012 and has so far caused around 2,500 cases and more than 800 deaths., 12:C - The R number is the effective reproduction number. An R number above one means that for every person with the virus, on average more than one other person will catch it. This leads to runaway growth of the virus within the population. Governments want an R number of less than one, which means some infected people are not passing on the virus, and this will slow and reduce its spread., 13:A - The infection comes in via the airways and spreads to the lungs. The more dangerous symptoms are caused when dead cells and antibodies flood the lungs with fluid and debris while trying to fight off the virus. This drastically reduces the amount of oxygen that can be supplied to the rest of the body. However, there is increasing evidence of the virus causing damage to other organs, particularly the heart, 14:A - It does now. The advice has changed. In the UK, the NHS says: 'The Commission on Human Medicines has now confirmed there is no clear evidence that using ibuprofen to treat symptoms such as a high temperature makes coronavirus worse. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat symptoms of coronavirus. Try paracetamol first if you can, as it has fewer side effects than ibuprofen and is the safer choice for most people.'</p>\n    <h3 class=\"quiz__scores-title\">Scores</h3>\n    <ol class=\"quiz__scores\" data-result-groups-length=\"3\">\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Excellent effort\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian coronavirus quiz\" data-min-score=\"6\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">6 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Excellent effort</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Could do better\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian coronavirus quiz\" data-min-score=\"0\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">0 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Could do better</p></li>\n     <li class=\"quiz__score score\" data-title=\"Great result - you've clearly been paying attention\" data-share=\"I got _/_ in the Guardian coronavirus quiz\" data-min-score=\"11\"><p class=\"score__min-score\">11 and above.</p><p class=\"score__title\">Great result - you've clearly been paying attention</p></li>\n    </ol>\n   </div> \n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>There</em><em> are no prizes \u2013 the quiz is just a different way to present some of </em><em>the facts from our </em><em>explanatory content in a </em><em>way that might surprise you or refresh your memory.

  "<p>Almost two-fifths of Britain\u2019s retailers have closed for business completely as a result of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>lockdown that has prompted a collapse in consumer spending unmatched since the financial crisis in late 2008.</p> <p>April\u2019s monthly health check of high street and online sales from the CBI reported that two-thirds of businesses had been adversely affected by the pandemic and almost all said they were experiencing cashflow problems.</p> <p>The employers\u2019 organisation\u2019s distributive trades survey polled 70 retailers in the three weeks after the UK economy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">enforced closure was announced </a>and found that 71% said activity was down on a year earlier, compared with 16% reporting an increase.</p> <p>The balance of \u201355 points was the joint lowest since the survey was first published in 1983 and only matched by December 2008, shortly after the near-collapse of the global banking system.</p> <p>Every sector \u2013 even food and drink \u2013 reported an annual fall in sales, but outlets selling clothing and footwear, furniture and carpets and recreational goods were especially hard hit.</p> <p>Wholesalers and car dealers \u2013 also covered by the survey \u2013 had an even tougher start to the lockdown than retailers. The CBI said 79% of retailers were suffering from an annual fall in business against 11% reporting an increase, but every one of the 24 motor traders surveyed said activity was down.</p> <p>Despite some hints from government ministers that the lockdown might soon be relaxed, retailers were pessimistic about the chances of a pick-up in business. A balance of -54 percentage points said they anticipated a fall in annual sales in May \u2013 the weakest expectations in the survey\u2019s history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the survey, which was carried out between 27 March and 15 April:</p> <ul> <li><p>67% of retailers said the Covid-19 outbreak was having a significant negative impact on their sales.</p></li> <li><p>39% of retailers reported a total shutdown of UK activity due to the outbreak.</p></li> <li><p>44% of retailers reported furloughing staff, while 8% reported permanent staff layoffs.</p></li> <li><p>96% of retailers reported cashflow difficulties, with 40% facing difficulties meeting tax liabilities.

  "<p>A surge in gun-related Google searches and estimated gun sales in the US during the worst public health emergency in modern history could lead to higher suicide rates, experts have warned.</p> <p>From early March to mid-April, when the US began to experience the full force of Covid-19, its residents conducted roughly 2.1m Google searches about buying and cleaning guns, according to <a href=\"https://everytownresearch.org/covid-search/\">research</a> conducted by Everytown for Gun Safety and shared exclusively with the Guardian. Those numbers signaled a 158% increase from what would have been expected absent the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Estimated gun sales also soared to 2.58m in March, <a href=\"http://smallarmsanalytics.com/v1/pr/2020-04-01.pdf\">Small Arms Analytics and Forecasting</a> reported, an 85.3% jump from the same time last year.</p> <p>\u201cThis unprecedented spike in new guns in people\u2019s homes and this Googling about taking people\u2019s guns out of storage, combined with this drastic increase in unemployment, presents a huge risk for a collateral public health crisis, which is firearm suicide,\u201d said Sarah Burd-Sharps, director of research at Everytown.</p> <p>Suicides already account for almost two-thirds of gun-related fatalities in the US, and <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2756854/suicide-case-fatality-rates-united-states-2007-2014-nationwide-population\">nearly 90%</a> of suicide attempts using firearms end in death, compared with 4% where a gun isn\u2019t used. <a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2756854/suicide-case-fatality-rates-united-states-2007-2014-nationwide-population\">Although the lion\u2019s share</a> of suicide attempts don\u2019t include guns, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-031811-124636#_i10\">research</a> suggests those that do comprise the majority that are ultimately fatal.</p> <p>Now, because of Covid-19, the economy has been devastated, victims of child abuse and domestic violence are trapped at home with their perpetrators and, generally, people are physically distanced and socially isolated. All of these phenomena pose risks for suicide, said Nadine J Kaslow, a professor at the Emory University school of medicine and a former president of the American Psychological Association.</p> <p>Some places are already seeing that the crisis around Covid-19 may be exacerbating suicidal tendencies. In Portland, Oregon, for example, suicidal calls to police jumped 23% in the early days of the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/calls-from-suicidal-people-to-911-are-rising-portland-police-say-coronavirus-could-be-fueling-anxiety.html\">even as call rates dropped overall</a>.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, not everybody who gets a firearm is going to use it to take their own life. People are getting these firearms for lots of different reasons. But it\u2019s [a] subgroup of people, and it\u2019s a subgroup we have to be, in my opinion, very concerned about,\u201d said Kaslow.</p> <p>Burd-Sharps found that when she and her team first pulled Google search data, the states with the greatest surges in gun-related searches were at that time considered to be, or be close to, Covid-19 hotspots. Many of them, including New York, California and Connecticut, usually have <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/gun-ownership-rates-by-state/\">low gun ownership rates</a>, compared with the rest of the nation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/us-gun-purchases-coronavirus-record\">Anecdotal evidence</a> also suggests that many of the buyers were first-time gun owners. That distribution matters because, say, adding a fifth gun to an already armed household isn\u2019t the same as exposing an entire family to a new and potentially deadly weapon, explained Matt Miller, a professor of health sciences and epidemiology at Northeastern University.</p> <p>\u201cTo the extent that there are new gun owners, those new gun owners are now putting themselves and everyone in their home at substantially higher risk of dying by suicide,\u201d said Miller.</p> <p>Before the pandemic, roughly <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993703/\">one in three US households </a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993703/\">owned a gun</a>, and even exponential spikes in gun sales on a temporary basis would be a \u201cdrop in the ocean with respect to the total number of guns in civilian hands\u201d, Miller countered.</p> <p>\u201cTo look for marginal effects of new guns or other types of exposure changes is sort of to miss the forest for the trees,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others, however, are genuinely alarmed by the trend of people buying guns or bringing them out of storage during a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of domestic violence. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re gonna see increased rates of child abuse occurring. There\u2019s little doubt that we\u2019re going to see people get into socio-economically dire situations,\u201d said Eric Fleegler, a physician and researcher at Boston children\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>\u201cThe presence of guns takes any toxic environment like that and puts a higher risk on things,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Fleegler warned in a recent analysis that the US is \u201c<a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2765237/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-firearms-united-states-epidemic-suicide\">primed for a suicide epidemic triggered by C</a><a href=\"https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2765237/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-firearms-united-states-epidemic-suicide\">ovid-19</a>\u201d, a tragedy that\u2019s both \u201cpredictable and preventable\u201d, partially by limiting gun access. And, he said, the consequences of guns being so readily available during a time of crisis could far outlast a single pandemic, a warning echoed by other experts.</p> <p>\u201cGuns are a durable item,\u201d Fleegler said. \u201cThey last for years, decades.

  "<p>I don\u2019t know what kind of disinfectant Donald Trump has been injecting, but the man does not appear to be well. The president\u2019s lethal medical musing has turned him into (even more of) a global laughing stock and the widespread ridicule has clearly bruised his fragile ego.

Is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/19/a-very-stable-genius-review-donald-trump-leonnig-rucker-washington-post\">very stable genius</a>\u201d starting to unravel?</p> \n<p>Let\u2019s start with the president\u2019s weekend tweetstorm, which, even by Trumpian standards, was spectacularly unhinged. On Sunday, Trump lashed out at what he called a \u201cphony story\u201d in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html\">New York Times</a> that claimed he spends his days eating junk food and watching TV. \u201cI will often be in the Oval Office late into the night &amp; read &amp; see [in the Times] that I am angrily eating a hamberger &amp; Diet Coke in my bedroom,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cPeople with me are always stunned.\u201d He then deleted the tweet and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1254491971558748160?s=20\">replaced it with one</a> in which hamburger was spelled correctly. (This was clearly a challenge for him: he has previously misspelled hamburgers \u201c<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/01/16/burger-king-hamberder-chain-trolls-president-trump-over-tweet/2590994002\">hamberders</a>\u201d.)</p> \n<p>It turned out that the hambergers were just an appetiser. A rant about the \u201c<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/494748-trump-on-noble-prize-tweets-does-sarcasm-ever-work\">Noble</a>\u201d prize, which Trump seems to have confused with the Pulitzer prize, followed. This was subsequently deleted and replaced with a tweet stating it had all been an exercise in sarcasm. He is a master of sarcasm, as we all know.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"29ae219a-db38-4e74-b8e0-effde9cb787b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1bX8kEHTbug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While none of Trump\u2019s aides seem able to shut down his Twitter account, they are trying to tone down his daily press briefings. Trump didn\u2019t hold a briefing over the weekend as he normally does, while Monday\u2019s event was cancelled and then reinstated. \u201cWe like to keep reporters on their toes,\u201d the White House director of strategic communications, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/white-house-coronavirus-communications-strategy-off-confusing-start/story?id=70363900\">Alyssa Farah, tweeted</a> with a winking emoji. She then deleted the tweet \u2013 presumably to keep reporters on their toes. Monday\u2019s briefing was notable for the briefness of Trump\u2019s remarks; instead of treating it like a political rally, he ceded the floor to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-us-live-cases-america-trump-cuomo-states-reopen-plans-latest-news-updates\">number of CEOs</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/trump-pandemic-floundering-coronavirus-crisis\">bump</a> in his ratings last month when he stopped downplaying coronavirus and announced a 15-day plan to slow the virus\u2019s spread. During his brief experiment with coherence, 55% of Americans said they approved of the way he was handling the crisis and CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, told viewers Trump \u201cis being <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/dana-bash-praises-trumps-press-conference-the-kind/\">the kind of leader that people need</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>The tide now seems to have turned. <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-largely-unimpressed-with-trumps-handling-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/\">Recent polls</a> show that most Americans are unimpressed with Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis. This includes conservatives: a Siena College poll released on Monday found that <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/ny-republicans-trust-cuomo-more-than-trump-on-virus-rebound-new-poll-shows/2390989/\">56% of Republican voters in New York</a> say they trust Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s Democratic governor, to decide how to reopen the state over Trump. Even Fox News seems to have cooled towards Trumpism; the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-cuts-ties-with-diamond-and-silk?ref=home\">network has just cut ties with Diamond &amp; Silk</a>, a pair of rightwing social-media stars who have been two of Trump\u2019s biggest cheerleaders, after they promoted conspiracy theories and disinformation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"344bdc4b-6f96-4fbb-b794-31be5382176e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TKqymsBdllg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps the only people more incompetent than Trump are the ragtag team of sycophants he has surrounded himself with. According to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/27/trump-hope-hicks-coronavirus-crisis-210808\">Politico</a>, Trump is leaning heavily on Hope Hicks, who he reportedly calls \u201c<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hope-hicks-says-goodbye-to-trump-white-house-photos-2018-3\">Hopey</a>\u201d, to steer him through the coronavirus crisis. Hicks, 31, who was formerly the White House communications director, is one of Trump\u2019s most-trusted aides; according to <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hope-hicks-trump-pants-2017-12\">one tell-all book</a>, her duties used to include steaming his trousers \u2013 while he wore them. It turns out Hopey is the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/hope-hicks-behind-donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings\">mastermind</a> who urged Trump to \u201cact as a frontman\u201d during the crisis instead of deferring to health experts. Now that plan has backfired, Hicks \u2013 who officially works <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/27/cosmetic-surgery-jared-kushner-botox-donald-trump-son-in-law\">under boy genius Jared Kushner</a> \u2013 is apparently developing a new strategy for Trump. He had better Hopey this one is a little more effective.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Every year, at Cannes (and other festivals) there\u2019s a plaintive argument about what Cannes (or other festivals) are really all \u201cabout\u201d. Some Savonarola-type person will dash the glass of ros\u00e9 out of your hand, throw your canape into the Med and tell you Cannes is not about red-carpet narcissism, not about stars preening in the flashbulb glare of celeb-worship, not about L\u2019Or\u00e9al sponsorship, not about getting drunk at a million late-night parties. It\u2019s about the movies, about cinema itself.</p> <p>Of course. And that\u2019s what the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/27/worlds-biggest-film-festivals-unite-for-10-day-streaming-event\">new Covid-19-related We Are One: A Global Film Festival</a> appears to offer: the 10-day online festival, beginning 29 May, curated by Jane Rosenthal of the Tribeca film festival, featuring arthouse films (though not the big-ticket Hollywood items) from Cannes, Venice, Berlin and many more, streaming for free in return for an optional donation to the World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 fund. So there you have it. A festival with all the frills and extras and flummeries stripped away. Just you, in your bedroom, with your laptop, communing with cinema. Isn\u2019t that what it\u2019s all about?</p> <p>Well \u2026 no, of course not. For a start, cinema has to be about the big screen, people all joined together in the dark, with no social distancing, thrilling to the communal experience \u2013 which sadly was also the attraction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/cheltenham-gold-cup-promises-last-slice-of-enjoyment-before-reality-hits\">Cheltenham Gold Cup</a>. It has to be said that Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, artistic director of Cannes, appears to have relaxed his objections on this score, just a little; having initially derided suggestions that Cannes itself would go virtual, now he has allowed some Cannes titles to go into the We Are One mix. And there have already been gags on Twitter about how online festivals will have virtual queuing \u2013 a \u201cwheel of death\u201d buffering delay that may or may not end after 15 minutes.</p> <p>And after all, the whole business of streaming has \u2013 for the moment \u2013 kept cinema alive: new films can get released for streaming during the lockdown (although the halt to production may well cause a famine a year or so down the line). The cinema experience is soldiering on \u2013 and for many people, for many otherwise inaccessible world cinema films, it has already been small-screen. And the films included in this online festival will be just this kind of movie.</p> <p>The difference, naturally, is money. Streaming isn\u2019t usually free, although there\u2019s almost a gold rush in progress now among film writers and cinephiles to find old movies available gratis on YouTube.</p> <p>This We Are One Festival is basically going to be a loss leader for all the big festivals, who might now be effectively conceding the reality that 2020 is the year of cancellation (though <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/berlin-film-festival-2020\">Berlin </a>and <a href=\"https://www.diff.ie/\">Dublin</a> escaped), putting aside their habitual competition with each other and making the best of things. They want to keep their various brand identities alive, though many will want to make no secret of the fact that this temporary arrangement, however bold with its We-Are-The-World body language, is indeed second-best. Festival directors will want to get people back to the real-live event with ticket sales, sponsorship, and the boost to their cities\u2019 economies and international prestige \u2013 in 2021. Or 2022.</p> <p>But there is a possibility that the We Are One online festival could be a \u201clegacy\u201d project, as they say during the Olympics. It could be a new way of people engaging with cinema. There could be an audience award, with people voting online the way Bafta members do, with every individual required to register with an email username and password. And if the We Are One\u2019s entire selection is kept online for the entire 10-day period, as opposed to each title being available for just one or two days (the way it would be in a non-virtual event) then this might be a way of getting round a perennial festival problem \u2013 everyone hearing in the first few days about a great new film from a talented young film-maker, only to find there are no more screenings. We Are One could, in some modified form, survive as an annual event around November or December.</p> <p>But in the end, after this is all over, people will want to go back to the flesh and blood experience, to see the films on the big screen, that sense of occasion that is the vital curatorial tool for focusing minds on a new film. And people will want to talk about films: talk about them over coffee, over lunch, in the street outside in the cinema. That is the festival experience.</p>",

Furthermore, a rise in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/increase-in-speeding-incidents-on-uks-quiet-lockdown-roads\">extreme speeding</a> during the lockdown, has led experts to suggest motor traffic could prove disproportionately lethal during the pandemic and urge authorities to make changes to city streets.</p> <p>Ruth Cadbury, a Labour MP and co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking, said action was needed to avoid a \u201cnightmare\u201d on the roads as restrictions are lifted.</p> <p>\u201cI think people are going to rush back and to their cars where they would have gone to public transport, understandably fearing infection,\u201d said Cadbury. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long before our urban streets in particular, in our towns and city centres are more congested than ever, so we will end up with a nightmare situation.\u201d</p> <p>The World Health Organization says cycling and walking are <a href=\"https://who.canto.global/pdfviewer/viewer/viewer.html?share=share%2Calbum%2CU6GDM&amp;column=document&amp;id=q3v02qdsh114763ffe3apo4s2p&amp;suffix=pdf\">among the best ways to practi</a><a href=\"https://who.canto.global/pdfviewer/viewer/viewer.html?share=share%2Calbum%2CU6GDM&amp;column=document&amp;id=q3v02qdsh114763ffe3apo4s2p&amp;suffix=pdf\">se </a><a href=\"https://who.canto.global/pdfviewer/viewer/viewer.html?share=share%2Calbum%2CU6GDM&amp;column=document&amp;id=q3v02qdsh114763ffe3apo4s2p&amp;suffix=pdf\">physical distancing</a>. </p> <p>Cadbury said local authorities could allocate road space for walking and cycling via temporary or emergency traffic orders, bringing forward existing plans or targeting key commuter routes, including to hospitals. She said guidance from government would help.</p> <p>The government recently announced a minor relaxation of traffic regulation orders (TRO) allowing local authorities to close roads without the need to advertise measures in local media. However, Dr Rachel Aldred, at the University of Westminster, said councils had little experience of TROs and some fear legal challenges if they try to make such changes.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe Department for Transport could help firstly by unambiguously stating that it expects and will support authorities to lock in traffic reduction and create conditions for safe walking and cycling, and simplifying the process through which they can install temporary changes.\u201d </p> <p>The shadow green transport minister, Kerry McCarthy, said government could provide a \u201csteer\u201d to local councils. She said: \u201cDo they want to go back to business as usual or do they want to use this as an opportunity to meet the goals we have got on air pollution, increasing active travel for people\u2019s health while <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/creating-the-transport-decarbonisation-plan\">decreasing road transport</a> and tackling congestion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t seize this moment, the moment will be lost if we return to normal,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Greater Manchester\u2019s walking and cycling commissioner, Chris Boardman, said local authorities can do more. </p> <p>\u201cWe have just weeks to act or face higher car use than ever as people avoid public transport,\u201d he said. \u201cMany cities around the world have seen the same threat and are putting in emergency measures to make sure people have a viable alternative to driving. UK cities have to make a call right now if they want to avoid gridlock and even higher pollution.</p> <p>\u201cIn anticipation of a prolonged recovery period, several Greater Manchester boroughs are now busy planning measures to ensure sufficient space is available for people to walk and ride.\u201d</p> <p>DS Andy Cox, vision zero lead for the Metropolitan police, said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about extreme speeding; while deaths and serious injuries overall are down, those relating to speed are not.</p> <p>With road traffic 50-60% lower in the capital, average speeds have increased in all speed zones. Some roads are seeing average speeds 50% higher than normal, Cox said.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a very significant risk at the moment, because of the high speeds we are seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the long term we would expect speeding to remain a critical focus because lower traffic volumes create an environment where more people can speed.\u201d</p> <p>Cox said the UK legal system should recognise the devastation speeding can cause, including death and lifelong disability.</p> <p>Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK head of campaigns, said pop-up walking and cycling space, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution\">Milan</a> is planning, could relieve pressure on public transport and help people maintain social distancing.

They have a relationship with the landlord, so I imagine that is a discussion they will have with the landlord to determine how much has the landlord been able to recoup and can that be offset against any loss of rent claim that\u2019s been made.</p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> Are you encouraging your members to pursue tenants? </p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> No, we\u2019re not encouraging them to do so, but it is up to individual insurers to make their own arrangements with their relationship with the landlord. But it\u2019s really again around community expectations as well. But <strong>they are contracts at the end of the day that have been entered into, and the insurers are abiding by those contracts and so too the tenants should be as well. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh: </strong>It hardly seems in the spirit of things though. There\u2019s a range of rent moratoriums that are being put in place as a result of Covid-19. Landlords are suffering some of that pain, and are then turning to their insurer, and you\u2019re telling me you think it would be alright if the insurer then went back and sued the tenant?</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan</strong>: No, what I\u2019m saying is they need to take into account the community expectations and the degree to which they\u2019re able to absorb that is really their own individual decisions. That\u2019s something that the company must take onboard themselves and decide themselves. It is down to the individual companies to make those decisions. We encourage and provide information to them, but at the end of the day it\u2019s an individual company decision to make. </p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> I think we can be pretty sure about what the community sentiment would be on this. I\u2019m just surprised that the Insurance Council doesn\u2019t have an approach to it, that you\u2019re essentially taking this hands off, \u2018it\u2019s up to our members\u2019 approach to what could turn out to be quite a serious problem.</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan: </strong>Well, I wouldn\u2019t quite characterise it like that. We do monitor the situation and feed back what we believe are the issues that insurers should be taking into account when they are making these sorts of decisions. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re absent in this discussion. We are participants in it obviously, because we want to make sure that the industry\u2019s reputation is held high. So that\u2019s an expectation on our behalf. And there\u2019s also a code of practise, which they\u2019re expected to abide by, which goes to issues around financial hardship and people in vulnerable positions. And that has some quite strong requirements on those particular companies to be able to abide by that code of practise.

So this seems a good moment to highlight philanthropy\u2019s essential and distinct role. In the current crisis, we need it more than ever, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/05/philanthropy-oxford-university-len-blavatnik-donations\">cynicism and derision</a> it often receives.</p> <p>There is a widespread view that philanthropic elites should stay out of trying to solve the world\u2019s problems and that \u201cdecent societies\u201d should only deploy funds raised through the tax system. But private donors \u2013 big and small \u2013 are making a vital threefold contribution to tackling the coronavirus: by funding research, providing relief and preparing to rebuild for the future.</p> <p>In addition to new money being poured into Cepi (including <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/wellcome-pledges-50-million-new-initiative-speed-development-covid-19-treatments\">\u00a340m </a><a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/wellcome-pledges-50-million-new-initiative-speed-development-covid-19-treatments\">from the UK\u2019s Wellcome Trust</a>), the scientific effort to rapidly produce both treatment and cure has benefited from an investment of \u00a35m over the past few years by the <a href=\"https://www.wolfson.org.uk/about/history/\">Wolfson Foundation</a> to upgrade the UK\u2019s leading infectious disease laboratories. Private philanthropy has always enjoyed more freedom than the state and even the private sector to make longer-term and potentially riskier investments \u2013 no voters needed persuading or shareholders placating before this money could be spent.</p> <p>Second, donors are stepping up to fund immediate relief for those hit hardest by the lockdown, as well as those on the frontline. The <a href=\"https://www.gatsby.org.uk/about-gatsby/covid-19-coronavirus-response\">food bank network has received \u00a31m</a> from UK billionaire David Sainsbury, Money-Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis <a href=\"https://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2020/03/i-m-making-p1m-available-to-fund-urgent-small-charity-coronaviru/\">has pledged \u00a31.9m for charities</a> helping those in financial crisis, and dozens of private funders have contributed to the new <a href=\"https://nationalemergenciestrust.org.uk/\">National Emergencies Trust </a>to support those most in need. The importance of mass collective giving, as well as single major gifts, has been underlined by the success of 99-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/16/covid-19-appeal-to-benefit-nhs-staff-through-array-of-charities\">war veteran Tom Moore</a>, whose fundraising effort for NHS charities <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tomswalkforthenhs\">has reached </a><a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tomswalkforthenhs\">almost \u00a330m</a> \u2013 and is still rising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd85ffb913feb35d85bbaa69f6680fb0c44bd559\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd85ffb913feb35d85bbaa69f6680fb0c44bd559/0_118_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Sainsbury\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The food bank network has received \u00a31m from UK billionaire David Sainsbury.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Third, many privately funded charitable trusts and foundations are quickly writing new strategies with bigger budgets and more unrestricted funding to help keep charities afloat as they face the double whammy of increased demand for their services along with dramatic declines in fundraised income. This need is exacerbated by the government\u2019s decision to allocate a set figure of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-sets-out-extra-750-million-coronavirus-funding-for-frontline-charities\">\u00a3750m </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-sets-out-extra-750-million-coronavirus-funding-for-frontline-charities\">to the charity sector,</a> unlike the open-ended bailout on offer to the private sector.</p> <p>Despite this important contribution by the philanthropy sector, no one seriously thinks it could or should replace state-organised, tax-funded action. Public and private funding play different roles, enjoy different advantages and face different constraints. It is therefore perfectly possible to be in favour of higher levels of progressive, loophole-free taxation and also believe that private giving has a legitimate, critical role. This case has been made by both <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/25/warren-buffett-and-bill-gates-the-rich-should-pay-higher-taxes.html\">Bill Gates</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/15/warren-buffett-higher-taxes-super-rich\">Warren Buffett</a>, confounding simplistic assumptions that the top 0.001% are inevitably tax-avoiding plutocrats with no concern for their fellow citizens and future generations.</p> <p>The argument that only elected governments should try to solve the world\u2019s problems \u2013 and that there is therefore no role for affluent elites \u2013 is fuelled by understandable anger at growing inequality as well as widespread distrust of elites. Philanthropy in this analysis is simply a fig leaf to cover the iniquities of an affluent, global elite, and a tax-subsidised plaything to fund vanity projects. As the Dutch historian Rutger Bregman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2019/jan/30/this-is-not-rocket-science-rutger-bregman-tells-davos-to-talk-about-tax-video\">famously told last year\u2019s Davos participants</a>, \u201cstop talking about stupid philanthropy schemes\u201d and focus on tax instead.</p> <p>Yet this pandemic has shown that setting tax against charitable giving is a false dichotomy. People see no tension between<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/26/millions-of-britons-step-out-to-clap-for-nhs-staff-on-coronavirus-frontlines-video\"> applauding the (state-funded) NHS</a> on a Thursday night and throwing themselves into (philanthropically funded) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/16/covid-19-appeal-to-benefit-nhs-staff-through-array-of-charities\">grassroots community schemes</a>. Charities are facing an unprecedented funding crisis. Yet charitable action \u2013 whether supporting research or backing mental health initiatives \u2013 is needed as never before. We don\u2019t suggest a night of the week for applauding donors. But perhaps now <em>would </em>be a good moment to encourage the philanthropy that is so desperately needed.</p> <p>\u2022 Beth Breeze is director of the Centre for Philanthropy, University of Kent.

It was designed to be a utopia of urban living, with high density housing, European-style plazas, restaurants, theatres and cinemas. Its striking architecture continues to divide opinion. Everything down to the smallest detail was meticulously designed (even the toilets) \u2013 except for one forgotten section at the back of the estate.</p> \n<p>Instead of becoming an ornamental garden, this neglected area was made into a basic community garden with a lawn.

I loved it then as I love it now,\u201d says Jo Rodgers, a Barbican resident who moved in 11 years ago. She leads the team of volunteers with fellow resident Francis Pugh. Before the current lockdown, each Wednesday morning their group spent two hours maintaining the garden.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt took me some time to realise what wildlife gardening was about. At the beginning I probably went in like a conventional gardener wanting everything neat and tidy. It took me a bit of time to realise that no, we don\u2019t tidy as I did before. We have to protect even the tiniest ladybird.\u201d</p> \n<p>Part of the skill of wildlife gardening is to provide sustenance for different species all year round. In February catkins and hawthorn provide nectar for early pollinators. In summer the meadow is covered in cowslips, ox-eye daisies and meadow buttercup (in fact, it looks like many fields would have before the intensification of agriculture). When winter closes in, holly and ivy berries provide valuable energy for birds and small mammals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"002695b3-6042-496a-acf8-074cd65ec5e2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Forget any assumption that gardening for nature means letting everything go wild. Whether you are managing a couple of acres or a humble window ledge, green spaces need to be managed. To encourage native species of animals and plants, try to provide as many types of habitat that your space will allow, do not use pesticides, plant species that sustain wildlife and include water if you can.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Can my garden really make a difference?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Absolutely. The 430,000 hectares of gardens in the UK are a crucial part of the Wildlife Trusts\u2019 nature recovery network, a plan to rewild the country by connecting habitats in towns, cities and countryside to help nature flourish once again. The RSPB, Wildlife Trusts and the RHS have all produced useful guides on how to garden for nature.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong> Is there anything I should avoid? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plastic grass, decking and monoculture lawns, chemical fertilisers and pesticides.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What about pests?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Insects are a crucial part of garden ecosystems but sometimes measures are required to control populations. Instead of using chemical controls, use organic methods and other deterrents where possible. Copper piping and eggshells are useful options to deter slugs and snails. Encouraging larger animals like hedgehogs, frogs and birds that feed on problem insects is also a nature-friendly solution.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nature dictates how this tiny patch of land is managed. On the south-west side of the garden, where thin soils slope down into the shadows of the surrounding towers, ivy naturally flourished. Volunteers have encouraged it to spread further as it provides food for caterpillars, cover for spiders and nesting sites for birds. The gravel path was built on the regular route a local fox took through the garden.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"236d4f61200bebd8b8c65901906da030121d693c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/236d4f61200bebd8b8c65901906da030121d693c/0_0_2006_1508/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selection of insects in the Barbican wildlife garden\" width=\"1000\" height=\"752\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We have to protect even the tiniest ladybird,\u2019 says Jo Rodgers, a Barbican resident.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Parkes</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Each year new species are being enticed into the garden.

  "<p>Carl Bergstrom is uniquely suited to understanding the current moment. A professor of biology at the University of Washington, he has spent his career studying two seemingly disparate topics: emerging infectious diseases and networked misinformation. They merged into one the moment reports of a mysterious respiratory illness emerged from China in January.</p> <p>The coronavirus touched off both a pandemic and an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/tech-giants-struggle-stem-infodemic-false-coronavirus-claims\">infodemic</a>\u201d of hoaxes, conspiracy theories, honest misunderstandings and politicized scientific debates. Bergstrom has jumped into the fray, helping the public and the press navigate the world of epidemiological models, statistical uncertainty and the topic of his forthcoming book: bullshit.</p> <p>The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p> <p> <strong>You\u2019ve been teaching a course and have <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/\">co-written a book</a> about the concept of bullshit. Explain what you mean by bullshit?</strong></p> <p>The formal definition that we use is \u201clanguage, statistical figures, data, graphics and other forms of presentation that are intended to persuade by impressing and overwhelming a reader or listener with a blatant disregard for truth or logical coherence\u201d.</p> <p>The idea with bullshit is that it\u2019s trying to appear authoritative and definitive in a way that\u2019s not about communicating accurately and informing a reader, but rather by overwhelming them, persuading them, impressing them. If that\u2019s done without any allegiance to truth, or accuracy, that becomes bullshit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea with bullshit is that it\u2019s trying to appear authoritative and definitive in a way that\u2019s not about communicating accurately and informing a reader</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re all used to verbal bullshit. We\u2019re all used to campaign promises and weasel words, and we\u2019re pretty good at seeing through that because we\u2019ve had a lot of practice. But as the world has become increasingly quantified and the currency of arguments has become statistics, facts and figures and models and such, we\u2019re increasingly confronted, even in the popular press, with numerical and statistical arguments<em>. </em>And this area\u2019s really ripe for bullshit, because people don\u2019t feel qualified to question information that\u2019s given to them in quantitative form.</p> <p><strong>Are there bullshit narratives about the coronavirus that you are concerned about right now?</strong></p> <p>What\u2019s happened with this pandemic that we\u2019re not accustomed to in the epidemiology community is that it\u2019s been really heavily politicized. Even when scientists are very well-intentioned and not trying to support any side of the narrative, when they do work and release a paper it gets picked up by actors with political agendas.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s talking about seroprevalence or estimating the chance that this is even going to come to the United States at all each study gets picked up and placed into this little political box and sort of used as a cudgel to beat the other side with.</p> <p>So even when the material isn\u2019t being produced as bullshit, it\u2019s being picked up and used in the service of that by overstating its claims, by cherry-picking the information that\u2019s out there and so on. And I think that\u2019s kind of the biggest problem that we\u2019re facing.</p> <p>One example [of intentional bullshit] might be this insistence for a while on graphing the number of cases on a per-capita basis, so that people could say the US response is so much better than the rest of the world because we have a slower rate of growth per capita. That was basically graphical malfeasance or bullshit. When a wildfire starts spreading, you\u2019re interested in how it\u2019s spreading now, not whether it\u2019s spreading in a 100-acre wood or millions of square miles of national forest.</p> <p><strong>Is there one big lesson that you think that the media should keep in mind as we communicate science to the public? What mistakes are we making?</strong></p> <p>I think the media has been adjusting really fast and doing really well. When I\u2019m talking about how to avoid misinformation around this I\u2019m constantly telling people to trust the professional fact-based media. Rather than looking for the latest rumor that\u2019s spreading across Facebook or Twitter so that you can have information up to the hour, recognize that it\u2019s much better to have solidly sourced, well-vetted information from yesterday.</p> <p>Hyper-partisan media are making a huge mess of this, but that\u2019s on purpose. They\u2019ve got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">a reason to promote hydroxychloroquine</a> or whatever it is and just run with that. They\u2019re not even trying to be responsible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Hyper-partisan media are making a huge mess of this, but that\u2019s on purpose</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But one of the biggest things that people [in the media]<strong> </strong>could do to improve would be to recognize that scientific studies, especially in a fast-moving situation like this, are provisional. That\u2019s the nature of science. Anything can be corrected. There\u2019s no absolute truth there. Each model, each finding is just adding to a weight of evidence in one direction or another.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the reporting is focusing on models, and most of us probably don\u2019t have any basic training in how </strong><strong>to read </strong><strong>them or what kind of credence </strong><strong>to put in them. What should we know?</strong></p> <p>The key thing, and this goes for scientists as well as non-scientists, is that people are not doing a very good job thinking about what the purpose of different models are, how the purposes of different models vary, and then what the scope of their value is. When these models get treated as if they\u2019re oracles, then people both over-rely on them and treat them too seriously \u2013 and then turn around and slam them too hard for not being perfect at everything.</p> <p><strong>Are there mistakes that are made by people in the scientific community</strong><strong> when it comes to communicating with the public?</strong></p> <p>We\u2019re trying to communicate as a scientific community in a new way, where people are posting their data in real time. But we weren\u2019t ready for the degree to which that stuff would be picked up and assigned meaning in this highly politically polarized environment. Work that might be fairly easy for researchers to contextualize in the field can be portrayed as something very, very different in the popular press.</p> <p>The first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">Imperial College model</a> in March was predicting 1.1 million to 2.2 million American deaths if the pandemic were not controlled. That\u2019s a really scary, dramatic story, and I still think that it\u2019s not unrealistic. That got promoted by one side of the partisan divide. Then Imperial came back and modeled a completely different scenario, where the disease was actually brought under control and suppressed in the US, and they released a subsequent model that said, \u2018If we do this, something like 50,000 deaths will occur.\u2019 That was picked up by the other side and used to try to discredit the Imperial College team entirely by saying, \u2018A couple of weeks ago they said a million now they\u2019re saying 50,000<em>;</em> they can\u2019t get anything right.\u2019 And the answer , of course, is that they were modeling two different scenarios.</p> <p>We\u2019re also not doing enough of deliberately stressing the possible weaknesses of our interpretations. That varies enormously from researcher to researcher and team to team.</p> <p><strong>It requires a lot of discipline to argue really hard for something but also be scrupulously open about all of the weaknesses in your own argument.</strong></p> <p>But it\u2019s more important than ever, right? A really good paper will lay out all the most persuasive evidence it can and then in the conclusion section or the discussion section say, \u2018OK, here are all the reasons that this could be wrong and here are the weaknesses.\u2019</p> <p>When you have something that\u2019s so directly policy relevant, and there\u2019s a lot of lives at stake, we\u2019re learning how to find the right balance.</p> <p><strong>It is a bit of a nightmare to put out data that is truthful, but also be aware that there are bad faith actors at the moment who might pounce on it and use it in a way you didn\u2019t intend.</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s a spectrum. You have outright bad faith actors \u2013 Russian propaganda picking up on things and bots spreading misinformation \u2013 and then you have someone like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp who I wouldn\u2019t call<em> </em>a bad faith actor. He\u2019s a misinformed actor. </p> <p>There\u2019s so much that goes unsaid in science in terms of context and what findings mean that we don\u2019t usually write in papers. If someone does a mathematical forecasting model, you\u2019re usually not going to have a half-page discussion on the limitations of forecasting. We\u2019re used to writing for an audience of 50 people in the world, if we\u2019re lucky, who have backgrounds that are very similar to our own and have a huge set of shared assumptions and shared knowledge. And it works really well when you\u2019re writing on something that only 50 people in the world care about and all of them have comparable training, but it is a real mess when it becomes pressing, and I don\u2019t think any of us have figured out exactly what to do about that because we\u2019re also trying to work quickly and it\u2019s important to get this information out.</p> <p><strong>One area that has already become contentious and in some ways politicized is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-antibody-studies-california-stanford\">serology surveys</a>, which are supposed to show what percentage of the population has antibodies to the virus. What are some of the big picture contextual caveats and limitations that we should keep in mind as these surveys come out?</strong></p> <p>The seroprevalence in the US is a political issue, and so the first thing is to recognize that when anyone is reporting on that stuff, there\u2019s a political context to it. It may even be that some of the research is being done with an implicitly political context, depending on who the funders are or what the orientations and biases of some of the researchers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It may even be that some of the research is being done with an implicitly political context, depending on who the funders are or what the orientations and biases of some of the researchers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the scientific side, I think there\u2019s really two things to think about. The first one is the issue of selection bias. You\u2019re trying to draw a conclusion about one population by sampling from a subset of that population and you want to know how close to random your subset is with respect to the thing you\u2019re trying to measure. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">Santa Clara study</a> recruited volunteers off of Facebook. The obvious source of sampling bias there is that people desperately want to get tested. The people that want it are, of course, people that think they\u2019ve had it. </p> <p>The other big piece is understanding the notion of positive predictive value and the way false positive and false negative error rates influence the estimate. And that depends on the incidence of infection in the population.</p> <p>If you have a test that has a 3% error rate, and the incidence in the population is below 3%, then most of the positives that you get are going to be false positives. And so you\u2019re not going to get a very tight estimate about how many people have it. This has been a real problem with the Santa Clara study. From my read of the paper, their data is actually consistent with nobody being infected. A New York City<em> </em>study on the other hand showed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html\">21% seropositive</a>, so even if there has a 3% error rate, the majority of those positives have to be true positives.</p> <p><strong>Now that we\u2019ve all had a crash course in models and serosurveys, what are the other areas of science where it makes sense for the public to start getting educated on the terms of the debate?</strong></p> <p>One that I think will come along sooner or later is interpreting studies of treatments. We\u2019ve dealt with that a little bit with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">hydroxychloroquine business</a> but not in any serious way because the hydroxychloroquine work has been pretty weak and the results have not been so positive.</p> <p>But there are ongoing tests of a large range of existing drugs. And these studies are actually pretty hard to do. There\u2019s a lot of subtle technical issues: what are you doing for controls? Is there a control arm at all? If not, how do you interpret the data? If there is a control arm, how is it structured? How do you control for the characteristics of the population on whom you\u2019re using the drug or their selection biases in terms of who\u2019s getting the drug?</p> <p>Unfortunately, given what we\u2019ve already seen with hydroxychloroquine, it\u2019s fairly likely that this will be politicized as well. There\u2019ll be a parallel set of issues that are going to come around with vaccination, but that\u2019s more like a year off.</p> <p><strong>If you had the ability to arm every person with one tool \u2013 a statistical tool or scientific concept \u2013 to help them understand and contextualize scientific information as we look to the future of this pandemic, what would it be?</strong></p> <p>I would like people to understand that there are interactions between the models we make, the science we do and the way that we behave. The models that we make influence the decisions that we take individually and as a society, which then feed back into the models and the models often don\u2019t treat that part explicitly.</p> <p>Once you put a model out there that then creates changes in behavior that pull you out of the domain that the model was trying to model in the first place. We have to be very attuned to that as we try to use the models for guiding policy.</p> <p><strong>That\u2019s very interesting, and not what I expected you to say.</strong></p> <p>What did you expect?</p> <p><strong>That correlation </strong><strong>does not imply causation.</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s another very good one. Seasonality is a great example there. We\u2019re trying a whole bunch of things at the same time. We\u2019re throwing all kinds of possible solutions at this and lots of things are changing. It\u2019s remarkable to me actually, that so many US states are seeing the epidemic curve decrease. And so there\u2019s a bunch of possibilities there. It could be because people\u2019s behavior is changing. There could be some seasonality there. And there are other possible explanations as well.</p> <p>But what is really important is that just because the trend that you see is consistent with a story that someone\u2019s selling, there may be many other stories that are also consistent, so inferring causality is dangerous.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/563882/calling-bullshit-by-carl-t-bergstrom-and-jevin-d-west/\">Calling Bullshit: The Art of Scepticism in a Data-Driven World</a> by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West will be published 4 August 2020 by Penguin.</em></p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2><strong>Realistically, when do you think sports will return?</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://goforward.com/doctors\">Dr Nate Favini</a>, medical lead at Forward healthcare services: \u201c</strong>It all comes down to testing. If you have rapid and highly accurate tests, and you have the ability to do enough of them, so you can test people often and quickly, that\u2019s basically the threshold you need to meet to reopen sports. Imagine if you could test every NBA player every day \u2013 and exclude anyone who tests positive \u2013 and let players play in empty stadiums, you could restart today. But you have to have testing available at that scale. It will probably be eight months until we have that.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://ldi.upenn.edu/expert/douglas-j-wiebe-phd\">Dr Douglas J Wiebe</a>, professor of epidemiology, The University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine: </strong>\u201cThat\u2019s a tough one. Not yet. Having testing available will make us all feel better. If [a player tests positive for Covid-19] we clearly have to isolate them and provide them medical care. The other kind of testing will be testing for antibodies, to identify [whether] an athlete been infected in the past. And if they have the antibody that should be a marker that they are now able to fight off new instances of the virus.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/10005456/geoffrey-dreher\">Dr Geoff M Dreher</a>, Johns Hopkins University, expert in sports medicine:</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put a timetable on a return. We want to make sure players and staff are safe and make sure if they do get sick or otherwise injured, that there are pathways for safe care without wasting any resources for the general population. When those measures are met, sports should make their comeback.\u201d</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://theplantfedgut.com/about/\">Dr Will Bulsiewicz</a>, author of Fiber Fueled: </strong>\u201cIt depends. I could see non-contact sports like golf come back very quickly. It becomes a lot more difficult for contact sports. Basketball is designed for the infection, and NFL is the same, they\u2019re climbing all over each other. I would love to see football this fall, what I worry about is not so much if you can test before gameday but that these players have to practice with each other all week. It will be very hard to test players every single day before practice.

Looking at how things are unfolding, by next summer we will still be in an environment where even though we may open day-to-day society, we still may not be in a place to open a big global event for people from all over the world to be in one space. I think we may end up having the Olympics postponed again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/holding-tokyo-olympics-in-2021-will-be-difficult-japanese-health-chief-warns\">Holding Tokyo Olympics in 2021 'difficult', Japan medical association chief warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Wiebe:</strong> \u201cBased on where we are now, I think it\u2019s going to be quite some time before we\u2019re in a position to be confident about interacting together in sporting venues, including the Olympics. We aren\u2019t even out of the woods yet on what may be the first wave of Covid infections in the US. People can plan for the future, but I\u2019m not confident the Olympics can happen [in 2021]. I think it will be very hard to have a large sporting event and have fans be a part of it in person\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Dreher: </strong>\u201c[Holding the Olympics] in July 2021, may be difficult, especially with vaccine developments taking from 12 to 18 months or longer. So to plan for hundreds of thousands of people to converge on a few locations at the Games will be difficult in that timeframe.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bulsiewicz: </strong>\u201cI would call it [the Olympics] 50-50. The Olympics are such an international event: how do you control people flying in from around the world? I can\u2019t imagine them having an Olympics without a crowd. I can see where they can stage the competition without crowds, but then you\u2019re undercutting the entire economic element of the Olympics where they spend billions of dollars building stadiums and expecting people to show up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be2864ab2c3473bd523463ecdf17b4d7b6d1452b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be2864ab2c3473bd523463ecdf17b4d7b6d1452b/0_236_3118_1871/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Basketball is designed for the infection, and NFL is the same\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Basketball is designed for the infection, and NFL is the same\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Derick E Hingle/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>When is the appropriate time for fans to be let back into stadiums?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Favini: </strong>\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we can do it this year. It may be well until 2021 before we let fans into stadiums. If we can rapidly scale up testing to the degree where everyone in the country can get tested on a weekly basis, we can start allowing people who have proven negative test results into stadiums in smaller groups. That scale of testing could be possible at the end of this year. But in the absence of that, we\u2019ll probably have to wait until a vaccine, which would be the middle of next year.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Dreher: </strong>\u201cA vaccine will have to be available, developed, and proven effective. Hopefully at that point, people can get back close together into the typical sports experience that we\u2019re used to. There are different timelines when that could happen, but for people to be traveling, coming together, and in that kind of close proximity, a vaccine is key.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Bulsiewicz: \u201c</strong>To be honest, we\u2019re pretty far away from that. We need to get to a place where the virus is not a threat to our community or you need a system in place to adequately test fans or demonstrate that they are not carriers of the infection. How can you control for the person who doesn\u2019t know that they\u2019re sick, and shows up to, say, a Michigan college football game where there are 100,000 people breathing on each other?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Should sports be used as an engine to jumpstart the economy?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Favini: </strong>\u201cLive sporting events with large audiences shouldn\u2019t lead the way for reopening the economy because getting 40,000 people into a stadium is actually one of the more dangerous things to do. I think it will be one of the last things to happen.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Wiebe:</strong> \u201cSo much of the American identity [is linked] with sports, but we need to be very patient when sports come back. We shouldn\u2019t try to give short change to Covid-19 because it will continue to warrant strict social distancing measures. We really have to nip it in the bud now to the best extent we can.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>What can fans learn from this pandemic once it is over?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dreher: </strong>\u201cA lot of things will be different especially in the acute period afterwards. Hopefully people will realize the importance of washing your hands. Realizing how fluid our society is from a contact and transportation side, and how linked in sports are with the travel, contact, and outreach.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Wiebe:</strong> \u201cWe may not be able to enjoy the atmosphere of a stadium the way that we used to. We need to have delayed gratification. The good news is that right now people are hungry for some sense of normalcy, so some type of engagement [is] a reason for optimism, which is what sports brings us. Even having fans enjoy sports from their homes could go a long way to making people remaining patient and willing to do social distancing.\u201d</p>",

They hear thousands of cases each year, compared with the 100-150 the supreme court typically hears. And largely unlike the British court system, federal judges in the United States are selected by politicians in a process that has become an intense area of focus for outside partisans.</p> <p>Trump has notched more confirmations of appeals court judges, faster, than any president at a similar stage in history, a record he frequently gloats about and <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/trumps-exaggerated-judicial-boasts/\">cannot resist inflating</a>.</p> <p>Trump has appointed 51 out of the 179 active circuit court judges, or almost 30% of the entire bench, and next month the total is expected to hit 53. By comparison, Barack Obama appointed 55 circuit court judges and George W Bush appointed 62 \u2013 in eight years each. Trump\u2019s judges, who can serve for life, have a starting <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">median age</a> of 48.2, compared with 52.8 for Obama and 51 for Bush. As the country demographically becomes more diverse, they are <a href=\"https://www.afj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Confirmed-2.13.20.pdf\">predominantly male and white</a>, and ideologically they tend to inhabit deep right field.</p> <p>Together, they are changing America.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My motto for the year is leave no vacancy behind.

District judges in the ninth circuit, historically among the most progressive in the nation, had been fastest to block his travel ban and challenge his incursions on immigration, LGBTQ and voting rights. In 2018, when a district judge in the ninth circuit blocked Trump restrictions on asylum applications, Trump tweet-raged <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1065581119242940416\">that</a> \u201cthe 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d with \u201ca horrible reputation\u201d.</p> <p>In the last two years, however, the ninth circuit has changed.</p> <p>Court vacancies and ruthless engineering by McConnell have allowed Trump to install 10 new judges on the ninth circuit, which with 29 active judges total is by far the biggest in the land. When the family planning cases landed before the court last year, two Trump appointees were selected at random to sit on an 11-member ruling panel.</p> <p>In late February, the court handed down its decision. The judges split 7-4 precisely according to the party identities of their appointing presidents. To the shock of longtime observers of the federal courts, the ruling greenlighted Trump\u2019s family planning restrictions \u2013 with the sure result, <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2020/02/24/19-15974_opinion.pdf\">in the words</a> of dissenting Judge Richard Paez, that \u201cwomen and their families will suffer for it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority disregards 20 years of progress, insistent on hauling the paternalism of the past into the present,\u201d Paez wrote.

I chide myself for feeling so disconsolate: things could be so much worse! Nobody I know directly is suffering. My children are oblivious and content. Outside my window, the tree that was in blossom last week has shed its petals in yesterday\u2019s breeze and coated all of the cars in shimmering pink. Yet I feel the weight of what is going on around us. I can\u2019t stop thinking of the death toll. I fret about my younger child\u2019s ability to socialise once this is over, after weeks spent only with family. I worry about my parents and grandmother.</p> <p>What has been missing from my viewing is any sense of joy or rapture \u2013 the idea of losing myself so completely in a film that I forget my own concerns, carried away by the thrill of it all. I think back to the last films that made my spirits soar like that: my second viewing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-south-korean-satire\">Parasite</a>, marvelling at the sequence where the Kims return to their underworld of penury, back to their basement flat awash in muck; or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma\">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a>, whose subversively warm and intimate abortion scene made me feel a swell of pure love. Those feelings are gone now \u2013 but perhaps I\u2019m not meant to be feeling them right now. Perhaps I just have to sit this out, wait for the passing of this misery before greeting films once more like so many other distant friends.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there for you,\u201d they told us, and they weren\u2019t lying. This week marks 25 years since the US sitcom Friends first aired on UK television, although sometimes it seems as if no time has passed at all. Between 1995 and 2004, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/friends\">Friends</a> was such a dominant presence on UK screens that it is difficult to remember what our nights in were like without the old gang. Even now, getting in some hang-time with Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Pheebs is as easy as firing up Netflix or switching to Channel 5.</p> <p>US television has been waging a steady invasion campaign for decades, so while Friends was a turning point, it certainly wasn\u2019t the first American TV show to find a major audience on British screens. In the days of three channels and no streaming, Texas-set soap opera Dallas regularly attracted more than 20 million viewers to the BBC. In 1980, its \u201cWho shot JR?\u201d cliffhanger kept an entire nation in suspense for the eight months between the oil baron\u2019s attempted murder and the big reveal of the culprit. By that point, evidently, UK audiences could wait no longer and the BBC decided to compress the usual two-week delay between US and UK broadcast to just 18 hours.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/dallas\">Dallas</a> had our attention, but did it have our respect? In his 2013 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/armchair-nation-joe-moran-review\">Armchair Nation: An Intimate History of Britain in Front</a> of the TV, Professor Joe Moran details the extent to which British appreciation of the show was couched in mockery. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/31/terry-wogan\">Terry Wogan</a> would often begin his Radio 2 morning show with a devilish takedown of the previous night\u2019s episode, and the soap was also a favourite subject of the legendarily wry Observer TV critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/28/my-debt-to-clive-james-the-howlingly-funny-critic-who-made-tv-writing-sing\">Clive James</a>. \u201cIt was never embraced as quality television because, frankly, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Moran now. As such, Dallas\u2019s influence on the shows that came after was limited: \u201cPart of its appeal was that it was very American and very different, so there would have been no point trying to replicate it. The appeal of Dallas was that it took itself seriously. Television drama has generally got higher quality since the 1980s.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9f201a98b8562d0b14d7dcea23c11eeb96b542e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9f201a98b8562d0b14d7dcea23c11eeb96b542e/0_160_3680_2208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sopranos\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gangsters\u2019 paradise... The Sopranos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This upgrade was already evident by the late 80s and pre-Friends 90s, when US imports such as the cop show Hill Street Blues and offbeat murder mystery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/08/twin-peaks-david-lynch-television\">Twin Peaks</a> were impressing UK critics. These proto-prestige dramas, involving non-cliched narratives and complex characters, were forerunners for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-sopranos\">The Sopranos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\">Mad Men</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad</a> and other shows that would come to define US television\u2019s 00s \u201cgolden age\u201d. Screenwriter Mark Frost, who worked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidlynch\">David Lynch</a> on the game-changing Twin Peaks, was describing his \u201cDickensian\u201d ambitions for the humble TV drama long before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/david-simon\">David Simon</a> started work on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\">The Wire</a>. Yet, despite Twin Peaks\u2019 subsequent influence, in UK ratings terms, it remained in the realm of \u201ccult viewing\u201d, albeit cult viewing watched by the Queen of England herself (well, according to a secondhand Paul McCartney anecdote relayed in a Twin Peaks DVD extra).</p> <p>In contrast, Friends was a near-instant hit in the UK, and while it was at first subject to the same sort of anti-US snobbery that afflicted Dallas, this surely said more about mid-90s British audiences than it did about mid-90s US television. Even as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seinfeld\">Seinfeld</a>, \u201ca show about nothing\u201d, innovated the sitcom form, the assumption lingered that British humour was somehow more sophisticated. \u201cIt\u2019s a common generalisation in Britain that Americans don\u2019t understand irony,\u201d wrote the standup Stewart Lee in a 1998 Guardian article. \u201cThis seems ironic, given that when the BBC tried to show The Simpsons, the cleverest, funniest, mainstream TV show ever, in the primetime slot it obviously deserves, they pulled it after a couple of weeks when the oh-so-clever British audience, who do understand irony, preferred to watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/27/sabrina-teenage-witch-abc-tgif-melissa-joan-hart\">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a>.\u201d</p> <p>In Friends, though, Channel 4 found a show that could appeal equally to the Simpsons/Seinfeld crowd plus Sabrina\u2019s many young fans. Indeed, Friends originated out of the US networks\u2019 desire to skew younger, and arrived on UK TV during a period when home-grown sitcoms \u2013 One Foot in the Grave, Last of the Summer Wine \u2013 were looking particularly doddery. And that\u2019s without even taking the endless Dad\u2019s Army reruns into account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"527c95b05b6837020555808a07e9f9d70d4375ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/527c95b05b6837020555808a07e9f9d70d4375ff/0_76_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frasier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steady, Eddie... Frasier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond any initial sniffiness, broadcasters proved willing to not only persist with US imports but also to put the full weight of primetime scheduling behind them. Friends arrived on Channel 4 as part of a formidable Friday night block, preceded by Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s groundbreaking sitcom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/28/ellen-degeneres-coming-out-gay-lgbt-tv\">Ellen</a> at 9pm and followed by the Cheers spin-off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/frasier\">Fra</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/frasier\">sier</a> at 10pm. As the US sitcom writer-turned-Channel 4 acquisitions chief Rick Mitz explained in a 1995 missive from Los Angeles, the hunger for US content was near-insatiable: \u201cAlthough US shows are getting more pricey, they\u2019re still much cheaper than producing home-grown UK shows. And if you hit it right, ad revenues go through the roof.\u201d</p> <p>So confident was Channel 4 in its investment that in 1999 the broadcaster spent $200m (\u00a3124m) on a deal to poach from Sky the UK terrestrial and pay-TV rights to both Friends and the Chicago-set medical drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/19/er-at-25-a-matter-of-life-death-and-george-clooney\">ER</a>. And the Friends phenomenon wasn\u2019t a brief, caffeinated high. Its rerun-friendly package \u2013 with short episodes and a high gag-rate \u2013 helped usher in the era of global mass-syndication deals, which, in turn, funded the first headline-grabbing, $1m-per-episode cast salaries. From 2007 to 2019, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-big-bang-theory\">The Big Bang Theory</a>, AKA \u201cthe new Friends\u201d, Channel 4 would pull off a similar trick, capturing the, by-then much geekier, youth zeitgeist and also airing each episode multiple times, sometimes in the same week.</p> <p>Arguably, the invention of the gold-plated re-run was a much more appreciated thank-you gift to Friends\u2019 British supporters than their 1998 attempt to \u2018do London\u2019. Having introduced Ross\u2019s British love interest, Emily (Helen Baxendale) at the beginning of season four, the main cast (minus heavily pregnant Phoebe) decamped to London for a season finale featuring Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous was big stateside). This inspired its own minor \u2014 and regrettable \u2014 US sitcom trend, with episodes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\">Parks and Recreation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/06/next-boxset-will-and-grace\">Will &amp; Grace</a> also making the trip.</p> <p>As the century ended and the golden era dawned \u2013 The Sopranos first aired on British television in the summer of 1999 \u2013 UK attitudes to US television were completely transformed from lazy derision of the likes of Dallas to breathless admiration. A wave of British imitations inevitably followed, initially the Friends-like Coupling, written by a pre-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/doctor-who\">Doctor Who</a> Steven Moffat, and later gritty antihero dramas such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/peaky-blinders\">Peaky Blinders</a>. More recently, the trend for co-productions has established a kind of transatlantic hinterland where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/17/sex-education-season-two-review-netflix\">Sex Education</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/09/the-end-of-the-fing-world-alex-lawther-he-is-not-a-psychopath-he-is-just-very-sad\">The End of the F***ing World</a> combine an aesthetic that is glossily American with a cast that\u2019s mostly British, and the trade routes have reversed once again. Now it British shows, typically those which, like Fleabag, cling most doggedly to their own cultural identities, that are being talked up by \u201cin-the-know\u201d American viewers.</p> <p>In 25 years, TV\u2019s version of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d has had its ups and downs.

  "<p>HSBC could be forced to put aside up to $11bn (\u00a38.8bn) to cover bad debts this year, as it prepares for the economic fallout caused by the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>It would be the biggest provision for credit losses since the eurozone debt crisis in 2011, when the bank took a loan loss provision worth $12bn.</p> <p>On Tuesday, HSBC announced it had already taken a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) charge to help cover potential defaults by customers affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-china-could-have-stopped-virus-as-global-cases-pass-3-million\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-china-could-have-stopped-virus-as-global-cases-pass-3-million\"> outbreak</a>. It caused profits to fall 48% to $3.2bn for the three months to March. </p> <p>The loan loss provisions were far worse than the $1.8bn expected by analysts and $2.4bn higher than in the same period last year.</p> <p>HSBC said the extra charges were mainly due to the \u201cglobal impact of Covid-19 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/25/oil-market-storage-crisis-coronavirus-plummeting-demand\">weakening oil prices</a>\u201d, but warned of further difficulties ahead. It also said fraud could rise during the crisis, leading to \u201cpotentially significant\u201d loan loss charges.</p> <p>\u201cThe outlook for world economies in 2020 has substantially worsened in the past two months. The impact and duration of the Covid-19 crisis will likely lead to higher ECL [expected credit losses] and put pressure on revenue due to lower customer activity levels and reduced global interest rates,\u201d the bank said.</p> <p> Depending on the severity of the economic downturn, HSBC said loan loss provisions could surge to between $7bn to $11bn for full year 2020.</p> <p>The HSBC chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very much premised on views on how long and how severe the economic impact is of Covid-19, and really the shape of the recovery that we see.\u201d</p> <p>He explained that while China and Hong Kong may be on the path to recovery, western Europe, the UK and US may see their trough in the second quarter. \u201cBut then\u2019s there\u2019s a very wide spectrum of what happens [after] that including the risk of what\u2019s called \u2018the second wave\u2019 in some countries.\u201d </p> <p>He said the current crisis was \u201cquite different\u201d from that imagined by the Bank of England in its annual stress tests \u2013 also known as the annual cyclical scenario \u2013 which determine whether banks can weather a severe economic downturn.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing, for example, unprecedented levels of government support and intervention into the global economy, which wasn\u2019t imagined in the ACS scenario,\u201d Stevenson explained. The scenario also modelled a much more severe downturn in Asia, and much higher interest rates that would have pushed credit losses much higher, he added.</p> <p>The Bank of England has insisted that UK lenders are strong enough to survive the Covid-19 crisis, despite forecasting a \u201cmore severe\u201d short-term impact than the latest stress tests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/20/bank-of-england-cancels-stress-tests-for-uk-biggest-lenders-coronavirus\">were able to simulate</a>. </p> <p>The bank said it plans to cut costs to help offset an expected drop in revenue and is bracing for a material drop in profitability in 2020. However, it has temporarily halted the majority of redundancies linked to its turnaround plan \u2013 which was expected to lead to about 35,000 job losses.</p> <p>In February, HSBC said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/18/hsbc-to-cut-35000-jobs-worldwide-as-profits-plunge-coronavirus\">might have to put aside </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/18/hsbc-to-cut-35000-jobs-worldwide-as-profits-plunge-coronavirus\">about $600m</a> to cover the costs of bad debts arising from the pandemic. At that time, the disease was still largely contained in Asia and affecting the bank\u2019s largest market, Hong Kong.</p> <p> The ringfenced UK bank accounted for $589m of first quarter provisions, two-thirds of which was aimed at consumer debts like mortgages and credit cards. However, Stevenson said some of that money had already been earmarked for potential hardship due to Brexit. </p> <p>HSBC said there was a heightened risk that businesses in some sectors may struggle to repay their debts. In the first stages of the outbreak, companies involved in the oil and gas industries, and the transport and consumer sectors have been hardest hit. But HSBC said the long-term impact of the outbreak on some industries was \u201cuncertain\u201d and may not be accounted for in its forecasts.</p>",

You may recognise her from her disastrous creativity workshops, for which she charged $165 a head and was branded a \u201cscammer\u201d; or from the tell-all <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/09/the-story-of-caroline-calloway-and-her-ghostwriter-natalie.html\">essay</a> her former friend Natalie wrote about their turbulent relationship \u2013 a she-said/she-said that is still ongoing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\">Who is Caroline Calloway, and why can't the internet stop talking about her?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When both went viral last year, Calloway was transformed from an aspiring memoirist who overshared on Instagram to a one-woman soap opera the entire internet loved to hate-watch. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\">Who is Caroline Calloway</a>, went several headlines, and why can\u2019t the internet stop talking about her?</p> <p>There are now 2,250,000 Google results for her name. Even seven months on from the publication of the Cut\u2019s essay about her, the 28-year-old continues to captivate corners of social media.</p> <p>Her critics loathe her for her self-absorption, her privilege, her perceived attention-seeking and questionable cash-grabs. Her fans love her for her willingness to draw them into her intimacy, her prettiness and pluckiness. Neither can look away.</p> <p>If anything, Calloway\u2019s \u201creal life\u201d is on the internet \u2013 especially now, a few weeks into isolating alone in her grandmother\u2019s condo in Sarasota, Florida. Her social media output, always prolific, has reached new heights.</p> <p>When I first reach Calloway by phone, I find her engrossed in making \u201cinternet art\u201d from a snapshot of her and Natalie \u2013 scrambling their faces, she explains breathlessly, for her Instagram grid: \u201cI\u2019m very excited about it!\u201d</p> <p>I am reminded of how Calloway began her long-awaited \u201c<a href=\"https://www.iamcarolinecalloway.com/\">Natalie response</a>\u201d, her own take on the harms done during their friendship which also highlights Natalie\u2019s part in building her public profile.</p> <p>An online publication (she declines to say which) had offered her a \u201creally big sum\u201d for the essay: \u201cIt\u2019s bankable clicks, whatever I wrote.\u201d But in response to the worsening pandemic, she pulled out to self-publish the piece as a fundraiser for charity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb5a2364c385e68655e4f863a8af478773bcab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2cb5a2364c385e68655e4f863a8af478773bcab9/0_0_3280_4096/801.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Calloway: \u2018People care about such bizarre and specific things about me.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline Calloway: \u2018People care about such bizarre and specific things about me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My call finds Calloway ebullient after having raised $20,000 for the frontline medical organisation Direct Relief from the first installment. (Over a month, the total comes close to $50,000.) She tells me she celebrated by putting her phone down, pouring herself a glass of bubbly and eating two entire jars of caviar \u2013 \u201clike a Russian oligarch\u201d.</p> <p>But as she goes on to speak about her experience of cancel culture \u2013 the pain of having her drug addiction turned into popcorn-fodder for the internet by her former friend, the vitriolic trolls she describes as \u201ccrusading for justice\u201d against her \u2013 it becomes clear that her sense of achievement is tempered by frustration. No matter what she does, she can\u2019t win.</p> <p>Take her fundraiser: some on social media have speculated that it was a scam \u2013 and then, after Calloway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinecaloway/status/1245163242353315841\">posted evidence</a> of the donations, a cynical tax break. It reflects the consensus of Calloway\u2019s \u201csnark community\u201d, as she calls those online critics keeping tabs on her every move: she cannot be trusted, and she is only ever out to benefit herself.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about taxes,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even thinking about my own bills.\u201d It was actually \u201csort of a sacrifice\u201d to share the essay now, knowing that it would get less coverage. \u201cI really believe in karma \u2013 I just hope this good will find its way back to me someday,\u201d Calloway sighs.</p> <p>But I wonder if, in focusing on her lost press, Calloway might be selling herself short. In publishing her counter-statement now, as the rest of us have been forced into quarantine \u2013 she has a captive audience.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>True to fragmented internet fame, Calloway still has little name recognition beyond her own following and the small subsection of society who consider themselves \u201cextremely online\u201d. Of them, however, many will know everything there is to know about her.</p> <p>\u201cPeople care about such bizarre and specific things about me,\u201d she says, not without pride. Much of it is vigorously contested, from the mystery fate of <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2019/9/13/20864383/instagram-influencer-caroline-calloway-yale-plates\">the Yale plates</a> given to her by Natalie, to Calloway\u2019s claim to be the youngest-ever person to have their kneecaps removed (the latter was grounds for more than one <a href=\"https://fupaper.blog/2019/10/10/caroline-calloway-gaslit-me-into-believing-she-doesnt-have-kneecaps/\">online investigation</a>, and Calloway\u2019s mother has <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/caroline-calloway-knee-cap-removal-surgery-new-2020-4]\">confirmed</a> the surgery to a reporter).</p> <p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s so, so rich about the kneecaps thing is that I was so fucking mocked for this in middle school,\u201d she says merrily. \u201cIf I could travel back in time I\u2019d tell my heartbroken little third-grader self, \u2018OK, bad news. The teasing is going to get a <em>lot</em> worse.\u2019</p> <p>By her own admission, Calloway stokes those conversations, if only by providing continual fuel. Trying to keep up with her online is like trying to note the particulars of running water.</p> <p>Whenever you look at Twitter, she\u2019s just tweeted. Often it is a retweet of a quote-tweet of her own tweet \u2013 Caroline begetting Caroline like a little nest of Russian dolls, all bearing the beatific expression in her profile picture.</p> <p>On Instagram, her life is serialised for an audience of 700,000 people, both in real time and in the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1HaHWdB1FD/\">long, stylised picture captions</a> she claims to have pioneered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Caroline Calloway's long Instagram post\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

I still want it.\u201d</p> <p>Born Caroline Calloway Gotschall in Falls Church, Virginia, an upper-middle-class suburb of Washington DC, at 17 she changed her name to one that would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B1HaHWdB1FD/\">look better on books</a>\u201d.</p> <p>When she joined Instagram in 2012, Calloway began experimenting with growing her following with input (sometimes paid) from her friend Natalie Beach, another creative writing student at NYU. She honed her winning formula of \u201cbeautiful photos with sort of sad or lonely captions\u201d while studying abroad at Cambridge University from 2013 to 2016.</p> <p>Calloway had always aspired to being an Ivy League student, even keeping a \u201cYale box\u201d stuffed with motivational memorabilia. But after she was rejected from Yale four times and then \u201cfor life\u201d, Calloway was accepted into Cambridge on her third attempt. It is there that she first became known for her Instagram presence, depicting a fairytale life of \u201cHarry Potter-like castles, Jane Austen-like balls\u201d and punting on the River Cam.</p> <p>Her breathless <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/mf3R3yneub/\">\u201c#adventuregrams\u201d</a> inspired derision in her fellow students \u2013 \u201cCambridge fanfiction\u201d,<a href=\"https://askacambridgestudent.tumblr.com/post/144599062665/whats-your-opinion-on-caroline-calloway\"> one called it</a> \u2013 and distracted from her studies in art history.

&lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Had Calloway gone viral as a publishing success story, not a scammer, it is easy to imagine her being praised for her dogged pursuit of her dreams.</p> <p>Back in New York the summer after her first year at Cambridge, her Instagram boosted by 250,000 new followers, Calloway engineered a meeting with star literary agent Byrd Leavell by pretending to his secretary to already be his client. (Leavell <a href=\"https://backmattermag.com/portfolio/printing-clickbait/\">has since called</a> her \u201cdeeply unwell\u201d and dishonest.)</p> <p>With his help, her memoir <a href=\"https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/69340-follow-the-influencers-social-media-stars-2016.html\">sold in 2016</a> for $375,000; foreign deals took the total above $500,000. But at the time 24-year-old Calloway was increasingly addicted to Adderall, an ADHD medication she had started taking recreationally in late 2011.</p> <p>\u201cThey were delicious,\u201d she says breezily now. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, they murdered my life and I\u2019ll never touch it again \u2013 but drugs are fun.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway called on Beach to help co-write the book proposal, as she had her early Instagram posts. These collaborations formed the basis of Beach\u2019s later claim to have been Calloway\u2019s ghostwriter.</p> <p>By spring 2017, Calloway says she was taking Adderall in such quantities as to be at risk of a fatal overdose: \u201cI was really counting my sleeping pills to do the math right.\u201d Later that year she publicly reneged on the deal with Flatiron Books, paid back most of the advance, and began her recovery from addiction.</p> <p>Calloway says Flatiron still owns the rights to her story of her time at Cambridge and that, though that \u201cdark, messy book\u201d is not imminent, they are prepared to wait.</p> <p>About 18 months later, shortly into 2019, she found herself going viral for her disastrous attempt at a global tour of \u201ccreativity workshops\u201d. Venues weren\u2019t booked, promised perks were downgraded or not delivered, and Calloway sought unpaid labour despite charging $165 a head. She became instantly infamous as a \u201cone-woman Fyre festival\u201d and a scammer akin to the socialite con artist <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/how-anna-delvey-tricked-new-york.html\">Anna Delvey</a>.</p> <p>The backlash was the first time Calloway had lost control of the crowd she had courted. In response she cancelled all but two events and refunded all tickets, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ceilidhann/status/1086008906994892800?lang=en\">blaming</a> her \u201ctotal inexperience with event planning and GREED\u201d. She reattempted the workshops in August, billing them as \u201cThe Scam\u201d of which she had been accused.</p> <p>Many attendees said they were satisfied, even for $165; \u201cI would have paid MORE!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/caroline-calloway-instagram-influencer-tour-canceled-scam]\">wrote one</a>. But journalists questioned charging such a sum for a meet-and-greet. The same criticism is made of her charging $140 for <a href=\"https://carolinecalloway.com/collections/dreamer-bbs\">her art</a>, a pastiche of Matisse\u2019s Blue Nude II.</p> <p>There are two persistent complaints, says Calloway, with weary authority. \u201cOne is that I take people\u2019s money, which I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m really on top of making sure everyone\u2019s a satisfied customer. Then there\u2019s the idea that I charge too much, and like I\u2019m somehow tricking people into buying stuff from me.</p> <p>\u201cThose people fundamentally do not understand the business model of an online creator.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>At the heart of what seems to rile many about Calloway is her apparent privilege. Her great-grandfather, a real estate mogul, once owned most of Sarasota; she has described herself as being \u201cborn into material wealth\u201d, but denies being rich herself.</p> <p>Last year a Vice reporter was moved to <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7e9k/caroline-calloway-the-scam-event-essay\">investigate</a> how Calloway paid rent and found court evidence that she had often struggled. Between paying for a Greenwich Village apartment, thrice-weekly therapy, and a web developer to manage donations, Calloway says now: \u201cI am so fucked in terms of income flow.\u201d</p> <p>She adds that she eschews sponsored content, many influencers\u2019 bread-and-butter: \u201cSelling my audience\u2019s attention \u2026 it just doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d Yet her critics keep score of her purchases (pedigree kittens, a trip to Berlin, an expensive ring) and confront her with them whenever she attempts to monetise her following.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ba0bc71137a791ae1cabbcc827f11e17aee1c1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba0bc71137a791ae1cabbcc827f11e17aee1c1f/0_0_4096_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caroline Calloway poses for a portrait on Thursday, April 16, 2020 in Sarasota, Florida\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t really mind if people think I\u2019m a bad writer, if they don\u2019t understand my weird Instagram performance art or they find my long captions annoying.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zack Wittman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To the world at large, the \u201cScammergate\u201d debacle remains proof of Calloway\u2019s shameless profiteering. Just this morning, she says, she blocked an anonymous Twitter troll for \u201ctweeting at me over and over for not providing food\u201d at the workshops. (She did.)</p> <p>But it was over a year ago, I say, confused \u2013 and unless they attended, why do they care?</p> <p>Calloway explodes. \u201cI KNOW,\u201d she nearly screams, her voice distorting on the line. \u201cOh my God, I am going to go Incredible Hulk on my grandmother\u2019s condo if we keep talking about this. Like, flip the dinner table over.\u201d</p> <p>She takes a deep breath. \u201cI love fame. I love being written about. I don\u2019t really mind if people think I\u2019m a bad writer, if they don\u2019t understand my weird Instagram performance art or they find my long captions annoying. That\u2019s part of the package of being in the public eye, and honestly I find it exhilarating.\u201d</p> <p>What is hard, Calloway says, her voice quavering, is delineating where the standard scrutiny of celebrity should end.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people tell me to shut up, \u2018don\u2019t play the victim\u2019 \u2013 but when you Google my name, the related searches are criminals,\u201d she says, with mounting incredulity. \u201cIt\u2019s not normal to be famous and to be associated with criminals who are <em>literally in jail</em>, when I myself am a law-abiding memoirist!\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>It is true that, if the conventional wisdom is \u201cdon\u2019t feed the trolls\u201d, Calloway\u2019s never go wanting. She continues to engage with her critics lustily, and at length.</p> <p>Her tendency to single out individual journalists has led to accusations of bullying; a T-shirt she made targeting one by name (\u201cStop hate-following me\u201d) was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ceilidhann/status/1092410035651657728\">pulled from sale</a> for harassment.</p> <p>Even her supporters can find their goodwill tested \u2013 such as when Calloway likened the backlash against her workshops to being diagnosed with cancer. When a fan said it was insensitive, Calloway defended it as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BordersGirlBlog/status/1162523601528152069\">good art</a>\u201d: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like my free content, you can unfollow me.\u201d</p> <p>Instead many opt to steep themselves in their hatred of her \u2013 and find company in doing so. There are now two groups dedicated to \u201cCaroline snark\u201d in Reddit, each with 5,000 active members, whose conspiracy theories and vitriolic pursuit seem to suggest obsession.</p> <p>They will even rally en masse against journalists they see as being sympathetic to her. The New York Times\u2019 Taylor Lorenz was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1212908773255401473\">inundated with abuse</a> for her assumed association with Calloway, despite having never reported on her.</p> <p>Calloway likens her \u201csnark community\u201d to rightwing trolls \u201cwho feel so passionately, and so righteously, that they\u2019re crusading for justice\u201d. It is hard not to get the sense that not only do they want her to go away \u2013 they want her to suffer.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the hands for a suicidal depressive to have been dealt, having so many people want them to not exist \u2013 the irony almost seems cruel,\u201d says Calloway grimly. \u201cA lot of people do want me to just stop being, period.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>Calloway has been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression. She says she inherited mental illness from her father, William Gotschall, who she describes as a bipolar, paranoid agoraphobe. Weathering his bouts of \u201cblack rage\u201d when she was a child led Calloway to believe that \u201cwe should take people seriously when they are host to a brain that wants to kill them\u201d.</p> <p>After her workshops went viral, Calloway started taking antidepressants. Nonetheless, for seven months she was a \u201cwreck\u201d: \u201cNothing had ever hurt that bad.\u201d She read Jon Ronson\u2019s So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed, \u201cone page at a time, having to take breaks to wipe my tears. I didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d get through it.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway continues to take an SSRI daily; \u201cA silver lining to that cancellation: it made me reconsider my approach to pills.\u201d Her experience of addiction had left her leery of prescription drugs. Over about a year from May 2017, she had \u201call but disappeared from Instagram\u201d, working through recovery steps with a therapist.</p> <p>The following March, Calloway sent Beach a heartfelt apology for being a \u201ctrainwreck\u201d during their friendship, and expressed hope that they could begin anew and \u201cmake something beautiful out of the mess\u201d.</p> <p>A month later Beach replied, accepting Calloway\u2019s apology, and kindly but firmly refusing to resurrect their friendship. Calloway remembers sobbing as she read Beach\u2019s email \u2013 but, she says, \u201cI respected that boundary.\u201d</p> <p>When Beach\u2019s essay I Was Caroline Calloway was published 18 months later, it made no mention of Calloway\u2019s apology or their empathetic email exchange. Instead it dwelled on Calloway\u2019s offhand slights, erratic behaviour and broken promises \u2013 culminating in Beach being abandoned by Calloway at a bar in Amsterdam and spending the night on the street.</p> <p>Many readers praised the essay as a relatable account of a lopsided friendship not uncommon in one\u2019s 20s. \u201cIf you can\u2019t identify the Caroline Calloway in all of your female friendships, then you are the Caroline Calloway\u201d was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejdickson/status/1171582480434028545\">one assessment</a>.</p> <p>Only a minority voiced discomfort at the gleeful reception of what seemed to be a voyeuristic account of an unwell young woman.

And rather depressing.\u201d</p> <p>Calloway says Beach reduced her to the stereotypical self-obsessed influencer, the sum of \u201cthe dumbest shit\u201d she had said in sophomore year. \u201cShe really flattens me into a one-dimensional villain. It\u2019s not confusing about who\u2019s the plucky underdog and who\u2019s the maniacal, vapid bitch.</p> <p>\u201cMost of all, when I talk about being stripped of humanity \u2026\u201d Calloway grows somber. \u201cHer essay is over 6,000 words long \u2013 yet she doesn\u2019t use the words \u2018mental illness\u2019 or \u2018addiction\u2019 once.\u201d</p> <p>The only mention of her addiction was forced by Calloway to a factchecker; she also clarified Beach\u2019s passing mention of her threatening suicide.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that my depression or my addiction excuses or undoes or makes up for any of the ways that I hurt Natalie \u2013 her hurt is very real, and my bad decisions were very real. Five years later I am still knitting together the broken pieces of my life,\u201d says Calloway, her voice wobbling.</p> <p>But, she says, she was \u201cfloored with pain\u201d to see her suicidal ideation \u201cscrubbed from the record\u201d: \u201cI was shocked.\u201d</p> <p>(When reached for comment, Natalie Beach said she \u201cchose to tell the story solely through my perspective, feeling that it would be presumptuous and irresponsible to otherwise diagnose or label a person I hadn\u2019t spoken to in two years. She mentioned the suicide threat \u201cbecause it was directed at me personally, and marked the moment I stopped writing her book and the end of our working relationship\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think that my depression or my addiction excuses any of the ways that I hurt Natalie \u2013 her hurt is very real</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The week the essay was published, Calloway\u2019s father died by deliberate overdose of painkillers at their family home. She says he was close to bankruptcy, and had recently been discharged from a psychiatric hospital after having his petition to stay hospitalised denied.</p> <p>In a later installment of her Natalie response, Calloway confronts her father\u2019s suicide in moving but graphic detail, with pictures of the autopsy report and the scene. Though it is affecting writing, one imagines that a compassionate editor would have urged Calloway to reconsider for her own good.</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not ready to open something up to the scrutiny of the internet, I don\u2019t write about it,\u201d says Calloway. \u201cNatalie made public, for the first time, the fact that I\u2019d struggled with suicide. I really wasn\u2019t ready to talk about <em>that</em> publicly.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6ee7568f4e207d3506c0984d9128e92dbbfd925b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ee7568f4e207d3506c0984d9128e92dbbfd925b/0_0_3953_3163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian Caroline CallowayCaroline Calloway poses for a portrait on Thursday, at her home in Sarasota, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I know all the hours of work that it took to get here.

Tweets about her go viral. Stories about her get read. After Beach\u2019s essay was published, Calloway was briefly a bigger search term on Google than the British prime minister, Boris Johnson.</p> <p>This seems to have led to a perception of Calloway as an online commodity, or as fair game. Even Jameela Jamil \u2013 an outspoken campaigner for kindness, and no stranger to online pile-ons \u2013 unthinkingly <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/caroline-calloway-jameela-jamil-scam-goddess-podcast-twitter-controversy-a9444981.html]\">joined in</a> on the Calloway-bashing on a recent podcast. Calloway\u2019s own theory on why she is so polarising is that she is too open about her flaws: \u201cWhen I pretended my life was perfect at Cambridge, I never got any hate. I do think the more vulnerable you are online, the more vulnerable you make yourself to criticism.\u201d It is true that, more than many in the influencer economy, she is less concerned with presenting an aspirational image than the work of maintaining it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes I feel like the best thing I can do for Natalie is to just let her capitalise on me, you know?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI made such smart early investments in Instagram,\u201d she says, describing how she bought fake followers (before it was stigmatised) to boost her profile and advertised on Harry Potter fan communities to attract readers already \u201cpredisposed to become obsessed with what they read\u201d.</p> <p>If she overweights these achievements, it may be because people are so disinclined to give her any credit. Today Instagram is arguably the most influential social media platform in the world; Calloway used it for storytelling when it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/2brokegirlsq/status/253318036524765184\">dismissed</a> as \u201cTwitter for people who can\u2019t read\u201d, and understood the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/oct/20/caroline-calloway-writers-journalists-social-media-influencers\">value of commodifying herself</a> long before respected writers followed suit.</p> <p>Calloway says she feels justified in monetising her audience, not least because of all that she gives away for free. \u201cI know all the hours of work that it took to get here. And I don\u2019t mean just writing posts \u2013 I also means the hours I cried myself to sleep, because the literal news was saying what a bad person I am.\u201d</p> <p>Surviving cancellation, Calloway says, \u201cis much like getting caught in a riptide. If you fight against it, you will expend all your energy, and you will drown \u2026 I think it\u2019s so unfair that people look at the ways that I let myself be carried by the current \u2013 the only other choice being to let it break me.\u201d (I later find that her analogy borrows generously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/24/taylor-swift-pop-music-hunger-games-gladiators\">from her idol, Taylor Swift</a>.)</p> <p>She appeals to me directly: \u201cHow would you feel about yourself if we woke up in a world where your name was replaced with my name?\u201d</p> <p>I would get off the internet, I say, truthfully, and she laughs.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In fact, the tide seems to be turning in Calloway\u2019s favour, just as she learned to swim. She tells me excitedly she was texting an ex the other day (\u201cI\u2019m horny as fuck in quarantine, I\u2019m \u2018reaching out\u2019 to everyone\u201d) who told her that it has \u201cnever been more popular\u201d to like her.</p> <p>It is possible that the virulence of her trolls has turned public sentiment towards her \u2013 or, as Calloway suggests, that her return to Twitter has shown people that she is self-aware and funny: \u201cNo one can roast me better than I roast myself.\u201d</p> <p>But it could be that the rest of the world has finally met her on her chaotic terms. From social media it seems that, during lockdown, there is greater appreciation for Calloway\u2019s constant spectacle. The internet has always been her world; now, increasingly, we are living in it.</p> <p>\u201cDuring this quarantine, I feel almost a burden to be entertaining more than ever,\u201d says Calloway. \u201cChaos is a weakness of mine \u2013 but it can also be a strength.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, not 12 hours after our interview, I check Twitter and find it in meltdown: Calloway has posted an uncensored, full-frontal nude of herself <em>and</em> made it her pinned tweet \u2013 equivalent to hanging a framed print on your front door.</p> <p>It was, she wrote, a \u201chumble apology\u201d for those who had paid for her essay expecting it to be 15,000 words and only got 6,000. That was a \u201creally funny joke\u201d, Calloway patiently explains when I call her a few days later. \u201cThe apology part was like when the pizza delivery boy shows up in the first minute of porn \u2013 it had nothing to do with what\u2019s about to happen.\u201d</p> <p>In reality, the nude was her small way of compensating for the loss of a Playboy shoot that she says was slated for this spring: \u201cI\u2019d really adjusted to the idea of the internet seeing my nipples.\u201d (Playboy says no shoot was discussed, or promises made.)</p> <p>So, I persevere \u2013 was the nude to build hype for her essay?</p> <p>I can almost hear Calloway shrug. Then she says something so spectacularly Caroline Calloway, I think maybe she could be a genius. \u201cYou could just as easily say the essay was hype for the nude.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was updated on 29 April 2020 to reflect Playboy\u2019s response to Caroline Calloway\u2019s claim. </p></li> </ul>",

This prisons and probation ombudsman investigation has now been <a href=\"https://www.freemovement.org.uk/brook-house-abuse-investigation-upgraded-to-full-public-inquiry/\">upgraded into a public inquiry</a>, which formally opened last week in uniquely challenging circumstances. Instead of inviting participants to attend the opening statement in a central London venue, Eves had to make the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr4XE4AnMo0\">statement on YouTube</a> from her home.</p> <p>Despite the unusual circumstances, Eves is optimistic that the inquiry will be able to function effectively, even if some hearings have to be held remotely over the internet. She has made an appeal in 17 languages to the 3,500 detainees who were held in the centre during the five-month period that a young whistleblowing employee secretly filmed his colleagues abusing detainees, asking them to come forward to give evidence.</p> <p>In the spring of 2017 Callum Tulley told the BBC that he was witnessing abuse of detainees during his work as a junior officer at Brook House, and agreed to wear an undercover camera for a number of months. He filmed one G4S officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/25/immigration-detainee-allegedly-choked-g4s-guard-demands-public-inquiry-panorama-home-office\">throttling a detainee</a>, digging his fingers into the man\u2019s neck and whispering in his ear: \u201cDon\u2019t move, you fucking piece of shit, I\u2019m going to put you to fucking sleep.\u201d</p> <p>He recorded others bullying inmates, making dehumanised comments, and showing no sensitivity towards detainees who were self-harming and suicidal. Tulley was occasionally moved to tears by the brutality he witnessed. Fifteen of the 21 staff allegedly involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/24/g4s-to-leave-immigration-sector-after-brook-house-scandal\">either resigned or were sacked</a> as a result of his undercover film, broadcast as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fp0QLDKgME&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Undercover: Britain\u2019s Immigration Secrets</a>.</p> <p>The public expects the Home Office to provide \u201ca safe, decent and humane environment\u201d for anyone held in immigration detention. The treatment revealed in the Panorama documentary \u201chas no place in a decent and humane immigration detention system,\u201d says Eves.</p> <p>She has a list of G4S employees, as well as contractors and volunteers who worked in the centre, who she hopes will come forward to give evidence. She is able to compel the key players to participate.</p> <p>Those affected by this scandal may be forgiven for having muted expectations, given that this inquiry follows a number of other investigations into what went wrong.</p> <p>There was disappointment in 2018 when the Crown Prosecution Service considered an investigation carried out by Sussex police, and decided <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-46077873\">not to press charges</a> against staff members accused of abuse. The Home Office asked the former prisons and probation ombudsman Stephen Shaw to expand his research into immigration detention to assess what had gone wrong.</p> <p>G4S carried out its own investigation, which has only been <a href=\"https://www.verita.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/G4S-version-report.pdf\">published in a redacted form</a>. It flagged up staff shortages and an ineffective whistleblowing structure as contributing factors to events. The Home Office\u2019s professional standards unit also launched an internal investigation and both the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/inquiry/\">home affairs select committee</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/home-offices-management-of-its-contract-with-g4s-to-run-brook-house-immigration-removal-centre/\">National Audit Office</a> conducted reviews. And there was also an unpublished G4S review into the billings and profits it made from immigration detention, after allegations of misconduct. It concluded that there was no evidence of profiteering.</p> <p>In May, G4S will <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-51573510\">hand over the running of Brook House</a> to Serco, so it will be easy for the centre\u2019s new management to dismiss any findings by the inquiry (which is purely fact-finding, non-adversarial and has no criminal remit) as historic and the responsibility of a previous regime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ecfcd408616180a82c0c5fefbca77dae58e8cd29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ecfcd408616180a82c0c5fefbca77dae58e8cd29/491_0_1880_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brook House immigration removal centre, near Gatwick, which is being handed over from G4S to Serco in May\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brook House immigration removal centre, near Gatwick airport, which is being handed over from G4S to Serco in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Panorama</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eves recognises the frustrations former detainees may feel, but stresses that the inquiry remains relevant despite the passage of time.

Zoopla says 373,000 sales have stalled since the end of March when ministers told people to delay their home moves if possible, and social distancing rules made valuations and viewings impossible. Zoopla says the market is \u201cin suspended animation\u201d and demand from new buyers has fallen by 70%. As a result it expects the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/sales-of-almost-400000-uk-homes-stalled-due-to-coronavirus-lockdown-says-zoopla\">number of sales over the course of the year to be half of 2019\u2019s figure</a>.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has renewed his attacks on China, saying his administration is conducting \u201cserious investigations\u201d into Beijing\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/trump-says-china-could-have-stopped-covid-19-and-suggests-us-will-seek-damages\">suggesting he would seek damages for the US</a>.

It has happened partly because of a collapse in demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdown and because of greater use of solar power. The UK\u2019s previous record was set on 4 June 2019. All but four of the UK\u2019s coal power plants have shut in advance of a government ban on coal generation from 2025. Since 2012 the average carbon intensity of the grid \u2013 the emissions required to produce one kilowatt hour of energy \u2013 has declined by more than two-thirds, from 507g of CO<sub>2 </sub>to 161g.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>UFO footage released \u2013 </strong>The Pentagon has released three declassified videos that show US navy pilots <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots\">encountering \u201cunexplained aerial phenomena\u201d and exchanging excited radio chatter</a>.

The figures come from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) in Norway. The most displacements were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa amid violence in the Sahel and conflict in Somalia and South Sudan. Natural disasters in south and east Asia and the Pacific also displaced millions. Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said it was too early to assess the full impact of coronavirus on efforts to address displacement. \u201cIf we\u2019re about to plunge into a recession, of course it\u2019s going to have an impact on the generosity of donor governments,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really bad situation for everybody.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Zoom call scandal \u2013 </strong>The Financial Times reporter Mark Di Stefano has been suspended after the Independent and the Evening Standard accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/27/ft-suspends-journalist-mark-di-stefano-accused-listening-papers-zoom-calls-independent-evening-standard\">listening in on sensitive Zoom meetings</a> held by senior managers telling staff about salary cuts and furloughs.

The US still has the most deaths, followed by Spain, France and then the UK, which now has 21,092 fatalities from the virus.</p> <h2>US conducting \u2018serious investigations\u2019 into China</h2> <p>Donald Trump has said the US will conduct \u201cserious investigations\u201d into China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/trump-says-china-could-have-stopped-covid-19-and-suggests-us-will-seek-damages\">could pursue the country for billions in damages</a> because China \u201ccould have stopped\u201d the coronavirus. In his return to his daily White House briefing after an absence of two days, Trump also said he \u201cdoes not\u201d take responsibility for reports that people have may ingested disinfectant after his comments last week on its effectiveness.</p> <h2>Holding Tokyo Olympics in 2021 will be \u2018difficult\u2019, medical expert warns</h2> <p>The head of the Japan Medical Authority said it would be<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/28/holding-tokyo-olympics-in-2021-will-be-difficult-japanese-health-chief-warns\"> \u201cdifficult\u201d to hold the Olympics</a>, even after it was delayed until 2021, unless a vaccine is developed. \u201cUnless an effective vaccine is developed I think it will be difficult to hold the Olympics next year,\u201d JMA president Yoshitake Yokokura told reporters in Tokyo on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m not saying at this point that they shouldn\u2019t be held. The outbreak is not only confined to Japan ... it\u2019s a worldwide issue.\u201d</p> <h2>New Zealand eases lockdown</h2> <p>New Zealand has moved to level-3 restrictions,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/new-zealand-starts-gradual-exit-from-coronavirus-lockdown\"> allowing some businesses to reopen if they abide by strict social distancing rules</a>. Around 75% of the economy is now operational, but workers were told to work from home if they could. There was much excitement at the reopening of restaurants and cafes for takeaway.</p> <h2>Australia eases restrictions</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/28/nsw-new-south-wales-coronavirus-restrictions-partially-lifted-to-allow-limited-visiting\">it would allow up to two adults to visit any house from Friday.</a> Sydney\u2019s iconic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/28/bondi-beach-and-bronte-welcome-back-swimmers-as-coronavirus-lockdown-relaxed-in-pictures\">Bondi Beach re-opened </a>for the first time in weeks for swimming and surfing. Australia recorded just 12 new cases of the virus nationally in the 24 hours to 6am on Tuesday and a total of 84 deaths.</p> <h2>Indonesia\u2019s death toll higher than recorded, experts say</h2> <p>More than 2,200 Indonesians may have died from Covid-19, without being recorded in official death totals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-china-could-have-stopped-virus-as-global-cases-pass-3-million?page=with:block-5ea787008f0821d5b0274cb4#block-5ea787008f0821d5b0274cb4\">according to a Reuters analysis</a>. The official death toll is 765.</p> <h2>WHO raises concerns about vaccines for diseases other than Covid-19</h2> <p>The director general of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said he is concerned about people missing vaccines for diseases such as polio and measles because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cChildren may be at relatively low risk from severe disease and death from Covid-19 - the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus - but can be at high risk from other diseases that can be prevented with vaccines,\u201d said Tedros.</p> <h2>China reports six new coronavirus cases and no deaths</h2> <p>The National Health Commission said half of the new cases were imported. A total of 82,836 confirmed cases have now been reported in China, with 77,555 cases discharged from hospital and a total of 4,633 deaths.</p>",
  "<p>If Ovidiu Olea is astonished by the fact that he\u2019s gone from being a finance guy to a mask mogul in four months, he shows no sign of it. The transition started innocuously. Late in January, when the coronavirus spread beyond Wuhan, Olea decided he would buy masks for his staff. He lives in Hong Kong, where he runs a payment technology firm. His staff isn\u2019t large \u2013 just 20 employees \u2013 but finding even a few hundred masks proved hard. Part of the problem was that last year, after protesters in Hong Kong used masks to hide their identity, the Chinese government restricted supplies from the mainland. Before the pandemic, half the world\u2019s masks were manufactured in China; now, with production there shifting into overdrive, that figure may be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-richest-country-on-earth-cant-get-you-a-face-mask-11585741254\" title=\"\">as high as 85%</a>. If China isn\u2019t sending you masks, you likely aren\u2019t getting any at all. We have no masks, local pharmacies told Olea, but if you find some, we\u2019ll buy them from you.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/11/how-the-face-mask-became-the-worlds-most-coveted-commodity-podcast\">How the face mask became the world's most coveted commodity \u2013 podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Olea got to work. In a journal article, he read that epidemiologists spoke highly of N95 respirators, masks that filter out 95% of small particulate matter. Stealing time out of his day job, Olea began phoning N95 suppliers in Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Ireland. Each one turned him down. \u201cThe answers ranged from \u2018No\u2019 to \u2018We only sell to accredited buyers\u2019 to \u2018Come back next year,\u2019\u201d Olea told me. After three days, Olea found a South African firm named North Safety Products, which had 500,000 masks in stock. Olea bought them all, at less than a pound per mask, certain that he would be able to sell the surplus.</p> \n<p>During their conversations, North Safety Products executives warned Olea to be careful. There were \u201cinterested parties\u201d lurking outside its factory gates, ready to bribe truck drivers for their cargoes. Olea hired a security detail to ride alongside his truck of masks as it drove to the airport in Johannesburg. (He sent me a photo of the team: six grim men packing pistols and rifles, clad in camo and bulletproof vests. \u201cThey asked if I wanted machine guns as well. I thought not. We\u2019re not invading Lesotho. Let\u2019s keep it reasonable.\u201d) In mid-February, two weeks after he placed his order, his shipment touched down in Hong Kong. Within six hours, the buyers he had signed up had collected nearly all of the masks. \u201cEven if I\u2019d had 5m masks,\u201d Olea said, \u201cI\u2019d have sold out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Olea, who has a keen nose for business opportunities, quickly became possessed by this new line of work. Since February, as the pandemic has streaked around the planet, he has bought and sold on another million N95 masks from North Safety Products. In March, Olea became a middleman for Chinese-made three-ply masks, too, the simple kind that just about everyone everywhere is now opting to wear. He sold masks to the Hong Kong government, to European countries, via their diplomats in Hong Kong and China, and to European companies, which wanted them for their employees. All told, Olea reckons he\u2019s sold about 48m of them.</p> \n<p>By April, Olea decided he might as well take the next step. He bought a mask-making machine from a Chinese manufacturer: an eight-metre-long assembly line, which shapes and cuts sheets of plastic into masks. When I spoke to him, in mid-April, I was reading about mask prices close to \u00a36 a pop, and Olea was waiting with giddy excitement for his machine to reach him. He was still running his payments firm, and masks were a departure from that work. \u201cBut these are weird times,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe all must do something to survive.\u201d</p> \n<p>No object better symbolises the pandemic than the mask, and no object better explains the world into which the pandemic arrived. Social distancing, at first, felt like a strange notion: the inaction of it, the vagueness of it. But the mask sang out to our deepest consumeristic impulses. In the absence of a drug or a vaccine, the mask is the only material protection we can buy; it\u2019s a product, and we\u2019ve been trained like seals to respond to products. As a result, in every corner of every country, the humble face mask \u2013 this assembly of inexpensive plastic \u2013 has been elevated into a fetishised commodity. One mask broker described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/market-for-chinese-made-masks-is-a-madhouse-says-broker\" title=\"\">a madhouse</a>\u201d, another as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/03/30/i-spent-a-day-in-the-coronavirus-driven-feeding-frenzy-of-n95-mask-sellers-and-buyers-and-this-is-what-i-learned/#199e11b356d4\" title=\"\">the craziest market I\u2019ve ever seen</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Countries have hoarded masks, and used them as chips in geopolitical games. Thieves have made off with them. Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga have started to manufacture them. We already have MaskClub.com which, like a \u201cjam of the month\u201d club, offers $9.99-a-month mask subscriptions: the best-beloved business model of hipster e-commerce. Last year, an industry insider told me, Burberry had toyed with the notion of putting face masks on some of its models during a catwalk show \u2013 a wink, perhaps, at our apocalyptic future. By March, things had become real, and the fashion house <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/30/burberry-making-gowns-masks-nhs-12479187/\" title=\"\">was pledging</a> to make masks and gowns for the UK\u2019s NHS. From a healthcare perspective, the mask was a matter of life and death. But it also took on the function of a talisman \u2013 as an object to hang comfortingly between the body and a diseased society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dwyer/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All this when no one even seemed to know precisely how useful masks were, or who should wear them. The advice we got was a mess. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">World Health Organization</a> maintained, at first, that healthy people had no need for masks. But people bought masks anyway. Shelves were emptied. People improvised. A friend of mine in Tel Aviv ended up fashioning one for herself out of her husband\u2019s boxer shorts \u2013 washed and dried, she assured me, and slid over her head like a balaclava. Then, in early April, the WHO reversed its counsel, and a host of governments followed suit, which sparked a fresh run on mask stocks.</p> \n<p>In this pandemic, the mask reveals far more than it hides. It exposes the world\u2019s political and economic relations for what they are: vectors of self-interest that ordinarily lie obscured under glib talk of globalisation and openness. For the demagogues who govern so much of the world, the pandemic has provided an unimpeachable excuse to fulfil their dearest wishes: to nail national borders shut, to tar every outsider as suspicious, and to act as if their own countries must be preserved above all others.</p> \n<p>When these tendencies combine with a fawning loyalty to the free market, the results can be ruinous. In mere weeks, the mask went from being an urgent human need to a cynically exploited asset in a global resource grab \u2013 the fastest such journey, perhaps, of any product in history. Sometimes, it felt as if the mask itself was beside the point \u2013 that it was just a trigger to rehearse old routines of acquisitiveness and discord, with no further, greater end in sight.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>We\u2019ve been living with the coronavirus long enough now that we can distinguish the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-face-masks-around-the-world-in-pictures\" title=\"\">various tribes</a> of mask-wearers. Note the shopper in the pasta aisle, clad in a classic white N95 with the 3M manufacturer logo just under the snout. The N95 and its equivalents keep out nearly every particle larger than 0.3 microns, and although the virus is tinier, the fibres in the mask\u2019s layers obstruct its passage. These masks are meant to go first to healthcare workers, which might explain the shopper\u2019s furtive, guilty eyes. Note the finance bro out for his allotted hour of jogging, wearing a Vogmask \u2013 a brand so stylish that its midnight-blue model might even match his suit when he eventually returns to the City. Note the extreme worrier in the GVS Elipse P100, the heavy-duty mask that promises to keep out 99.97% of particles. In the age of Covid-19, the equivalent of sensible shoes may be the simple surgical mask or the home-hemmed cloth. The gaps in their weave are big enough for the virus to pass through, but they do at least protect others from the wearer\u2019s sneezes and coughs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d25beb5-14fb-47b4-bd06-0714dbfabc04\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cqLnDhHSJDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Such deep familiarity with masks is hard-won. The pandemic has brought on a global shortage of masks, which is really a global shortage of one particular plastic inside the masks \u2013 a type of non-woven polypropylene that acts as a filter. In casual conversation, people in the mask business call the plastic \u201cmeltblown\u201d, referring to how its plastic filaments are made. Meltblown goes into many things: jackets, nappies, filters in water purifiers and air conditioners. Masks are in short supply not because they\u2019re difficult to produce, but because the meltblown industry is used to stable, long-term demand. It churns out just enough for its customers and no more. To install an assembly line of meltblown takes many months, even at the calmest of times; with demand now soaring, some companies supplying meltblown equipment are quoting timelines of up to two years to even deliver a new machine.</p> \n<p>Hot out of the plant, meltblown looks like a giant toilet roll: 15,000 yards or so of polypropylene wrapped around a cardboard core. The material feels like synthetic cloth, but it\u2019s so thin that you might accidentally put your finger through it, an executive at one American meltblown manufacturer told me. He asked to keep his and his company\u2019s names out of this article, for a reason I\u2019ve never been given before. They don\u2019t want to be known more widely, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re so overburdened with enquiries already. If any further information gets out, that\u2019s another thousand messages coming in every day. That makes it impossible to do any work.\u201d Until last year, just 2 or 3% of his company\u2019s meltblown went into face masks, he said. This year, it\u2019s 95%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1/0_301_4941_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chine Nouvelle/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Until now, countries didn\u2019t consider meltblown a strategic commodity, so during the past three decades, much of its production has migrated from the west to low-cost factories in Asia. The executive\u2019s company is one of just five or 10 remaining manufacturers in the US, he said, and China produces close to half of all the meltblown in the world. As a result, the rush for masks provided a compressed, vivid reminder of something we\u2019d been aware of for a couple of decades now: that in all manufacturing and trade, the lines of commerce inevitably bend towards China.</p> \n<p>Early in February, the Chinese government began preventing exports of meltblown, so that the material could first be used to assemble masks for China\u2019s own population. The prospect of being cut off from half the world\u2019s meltblown supply \u201cput the fear of God\u201d into everyone who manufactured anything that contained it, the executive said. The market price of meltblown went up fourfold. He began to get 200 or 300 phone calls a day from mask companies all over the world, demanding meltblown. Even Chinese mask manufacturers rang him, worried that their country might run out. They\u2019d offer cash up front and try to outbid each other. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Name your price, any price you want to, anything,\u2019 and I\u2019d explain that we don\u2019t do it that way,\u201d said the executive. Then they dangled bribes before him: all-expenses-paid holidays. Just tell us where you want to go.</p> \n<p>Also in February, the Chinese government effectively made itself the sole customer of the major mask-making factories in its territory. This applied to Chinese-owned companies, but also to big mask plants in China owned by foreign firms; their products were earmarked for domestic use and banned from being shipped overseas. On 3 February, in <a href=\"https://guide.jsp.co.uk/statement/JSP%20Coronavirus%20Statement%203%20February%202020.pdf\" title=\"\">an apologetic letter</a> to customers, the British company JSP Safety said that its output of masks was running low, because two of its Chinese factories had been \u201cformally requisitioned by the government to make disposable RPE [respiratory protection equipment] for Chinese government agencies\u201d.</p> \n<p>Christopher Dobbing, who founded the Cambridge Mask Company in 2015, said his own factory in China was small enough to escape the government\u2019s notice, so his inventory wasn\u2019t snapped up by the authorities. But he did see, first-hand, the wave of Chinese panic-buying. \u201cChinese communities everywhere snapped up our masks wherever we had a footprint, so that they could send them home,\u201d Dobbing said. Chinese companies overseas <a href=\"http://www.chinaisa.org.cn/gxportal/xfgl/portal/content.html?articleId=4e44369ab9d5797768fa034525b2aad5c816782b7dd0ee3c401cfc3af43c1c3a&amp;columnId=58af05dfb6b4300151760176d2aad0a04c275aaadbb1315039263f021f920dcd\" title=\"\">were also</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/china-implores-employees-and-clients-to-scour-world-for-masks\" title=\"\">asked</a> to purchase and ship back masks. On 26 January, Dobbing got 1,200 emails and 400 phone calls. \u201cMaybe they thought we were a huge company, but we were just a couple of guys in an office, panicking as the orders flowed in.\u201d By 28 January, he was taking pre-orders for March.</p> \n<p>Roughly 2bn masks were imported into China in February. To those with a kneejerk mistrust of China\u2019s rulers, it appeared as if, having first failed to contain the disease, they were now ransacking the mask market just when the coronavirus was starting to race through other nations. After a Chinese real-estate company in Sydney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-doctors-issue-protective-equipment-warning-after-report-china-backed-firm-sourced-bulk-supplies-from-sydney\" title=\"\">was discovered</a> to have bought millions of masks, the Australian Medical Association urged its government to keep protective gear safe from foreign buyers. A lawyer attached to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/trump-admin-weighs-legal-action-over-alleged-chinese-hoarding-of-ppe/\" title=\"\">compared</a> China\u2019s actions to \u201cfirst-degree murder\u201d and wondered aloud if the US could sue Beijing. The US state of Missouri then went on to do just that, arguing in its <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/2019/prc-complaint.pdf?sfvrsn=86ae7ab_2\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> that China had \u201choarded personal protective equipment \u2013 thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable\u201d.</p> \n<p>But for the US and the rest of the west to complain about China aggressively pursuing its own interests is, in one way, to engage in a fundamental duplicity. China\u2019s wealth and power are the result of a longstanding international consensus championed by the US: that the quest for the lowest possible cost of production and the highest possible profit is paramount. According to this philosophy, if that means offshoring nearly everything to China, nothing must be allowed to stand in the way: not the hollowing-out of industry at home, or the loss of livelihoods, or human-rights concerns. And it isn\u2019t just China that has prospered from this arrangement. It has also been good to the richest people in the richest countries. Many of those same people now seem affronted by the world they helped create.</p> \n<p>As events transpired, few large nations behaved very differently from China once the disease blazed up within their own borders. \u201cA dog-eat-dog world is back,\u201d one former Polish diplomat <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/amid-coronavirus-a-dog-eat-dog-world-is-back/\" title=\"\">lamented</a>, as if such a world had ever gone anywhere in the first place.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>By mid-March, China had relaxed its rules, allowing both masks and meltblown to be sold overseas again, to nations that were now in dire need of pandemic gear. But the market kept failing: supplies of masks often didn\u2019t make it to doctors, nurses, the elderly and others who required them most.</p> \n<p>During the great global scrum that followed, governments used every conceivable means to get hold of masks for their citizens before they went elsewhere. Foreign embassies in China turned their diplomatic staff <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/coronavirus-mea-plays-proactive-role-in-fight-against-covid-19/1938679/\" title=\"\">into scouts</a> for medical supplies; Canada hired a multinational consulting firm to help <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-building-own-ppe-supply-chain-in-china-1.5530259\" title=\"\">figure out</a> which manufacturers could be trusted. Freight agents in China, who book space on ships and planes for goods leaving the country, found themselves handling medical equipment and little else. One agent in Shanghai, Fredrik Barner, had been shipping auto parts until this spring, when he was flooded with orders to move masks instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for 10 years and I\u2019ve never seen such high air-freight rates,\u201d Barner told me. \u201cNormally, the rate is around $3 or $4 a kilogram. That went up to $17 or $18.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nations that couldn\u2019t make enough masks for themselves had to find unconventional ways to bring them in from China. In Ireland, the government asked Aer Lingus to run supplies out of Beijing. The airline had never flown to China before, and the planning and approvals for a new route would usually have taken six months. Aer Lingus did it in a week. Brian O\u2019Sullivan, Aer Lingus\u2019s chief flying instructor, captained the first plane to Beijing on 27 March, taking with him four other pilots, two engineers and a specialist in balancing loads in an airplane. Ten hours out, six hours on the ground, then 13 hours back: the kind of flight schedule that is, for a single crew, inconceivable in regular aviation.</p> \n<p>They landed in Beijing very early on a Sunday morning. Through the plane\u2019s open door, O\u2019Sullivan noticed that the airport, which usually buzzes like a beehive with flights landing and taking off, was practically in hibernation; in six hours, he saw just half a dozen or so departures. His crew never left the aircraft, O\u2019Sullivan told me, because that would have required them to go into quarantine. Instead, they stayed in business class, behind thick plastic drapes, while ground handlers loaded first the cargo hold and then economy class: huge green bags filled with masks, gowns and gloves were strapped into the seats, as if the cabin had been booked out by gigantic pods of peas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shake hands with anyone,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said, \u201cbut there were plenty of smiles and thankyous and nodding heads.\u201d When I spoke to him in mid-April, Aer Lingus had completed 30 Beijing flights, and expected to run another 200 or so by the end of May.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To meet the rush for masks, a strange alternate ecosystem of suppliers sprang up, often supplying products of dubious quality. In Europe, several buyers of Chinese masks found their products to be sub-standard. The Dutch government had to recall 600,000 masks. Finland <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/09/finland-discovers-masks-bought-from-china-not-hospital-safe.html\" title=\"\">discovered</a> that an order of 2m surgical masks, which are discarded after use with a single patient, weren\u2019t good enough for hospital wear. Even if they had been up to scratch, those 2m masks would have only met the country\u2019s needs for four days.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t always clear who was producing these masks. Being in the trade, Christopher Dobbing got a number of emails throughout March and April from Chinese mask vendors he\u2019d never heard of before. He sent me a few of them, and I rang one of the listed numbers, in the city of Zhangjiagang, 100 miles or so from Shanghai. A woman picked up and introduced herself as Rita. She told me that the company she worked for had been selling K95 masks since the first week of March, for $2.50 a pop. I asked if they manufactured the masks as well.</p> \n<p>She laughed. \u201cNo, we make tin plate. But our clients in America and Europe asked if we could source masks, so we do that now,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe get them from a big factory nearby, which makes masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>I asked how long it would take to send 10,000 masks to London. She couldn\u2019t say. There weren\u2019t many flights out of the country, and after some batches of exported masks had been found to be defective, Chinese customs authorities were inspecting mask cargoes more rigorously. A friend of hers, another mask vendor, had been waiting two weeks already for one of her shipments to clear customs, she told me.</p> \n<p>The factory that actually made the masks belonged to another company, Rita said. Chinese manufacturers that produce masks for medical use in the west must be certified by government health agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Rita assured me that the manufacturer had an FDA certificate, and she emailed me a scan to prove it. It had been issued on 1 April. In the space where the manufacturer\u2019s name should have been displayed, there was just a short span of white space followed by the generic words Technology Co., Ltd. It looked like any company might print its name into the blank space and make the certificate its own. On the FDA\u2019s database, I looked up the certificate\u2019s number. The FDA had awarded it to Jiangsu Newborn Medical Technology Co, Ltd \u2013 a different company altogether.</p> \n<p>Among those tempted to reinvent themselves as mask merchants were drug dealers, who used the crisis to diversify their portfolio. Logan Pauley, a researcher at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington DC, tracks the sales of illicit drugs on the internet, focusing on trafficking from east Asia to the rest of the world. Towards the end of February, he noticed that some of the dealers he monitors were advertising masks and gloves. He sent me screenshots. \u201cMask, 3ply, 50pcs per box, 20 box min. $33.50 per box, exclude shipping charges,\u201d ran one Facebook post by a user named Vicky, in a group where people otherwise offer fentanyl for sale.</p> \n<p>It was difficult to know how to feel about these transactions, Pauley said. On the one hand, Vicky\u2019s masks might well be of terrible quality, and there was a danger that the masks would be deliberately mislabelled, whisked through US customs, and then sold on to US hospitals short of gear. \u201cCustoms is swamped right now,\u201d said Pauley. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be opening and checking every box.\u201d On the other hand, he said, the FDA and other international authorities that license medical supplies \u201chave made it difficult, in this time of need, to get new suppliers approved in a timely fashion. If the masks are good, the hospital may be paying three times the price for them, but it\u2019s still better than waiting for FDA approvals.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was right. If I\u2019d been a hospital administrator in critical need of masks, perhaps I\u2019d have placed an order with one of these shadowy brokers. In the absence of government supplies or a well-ordered mask market, the seediest corners of the internet seemed to offer one of the few ways to find any masks at all.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Alongside the new mask middlemen and the criminal elements finding a fresh vocation, there were the groups who had never fabricated a mask before, but who had a sure sense of money to be made. From February onwards, legions of new mask-makers emerged, of every size and shape: from big companies such as BMW to the amateurs the meltblown executive characterised as \u201cfour neighbours in a cul-de-sac in Los Angeles, who\u2019ve gone on to the internet to learn about sewing masks\u201d. A face mask-making machine costs about $100,000, he told me, and it makes about 70,000-100,000 masks a day. He has received at least 200 enquiries from Americans who are importing machines from China \u2013 \u201cpeople who just have 100K to spend and a bit of space, and want to make some money.\u201d</p> \n<p>You\u2019d like to think they have some experience doing this, he said, but many of them don\u2019t know a thing. They ring him when they\u2019re expecting a new machine in three weeks, to ask vaguely for mask textile.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo you want meltblown?\u201d he asks them.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<p>What about noseclips? What about spun-bound polypropylene, the plastic that encases the melt-blown?</p> \n<p>\u201cOh, we need to get some of that, too, do we?\u201d</p> \n<p>And then, the executive said to me with a sigh: \u201cI have to spend half an hour teaching them about mask manufacturing.\u201d</p> \n<p>All these breakdowns in the market \u2013 the hospitals without masks, the bogus gear, the exorbitant prices, the hoarding, the fly-by-night profiteers \u2013 seem to expose the limits of orthodox economics. The most ardent devotees of the free market believe that supply and demand solve every basic problem if they\u2019re permitted to work unconstrained. When demand is high, the price climbs, and the prospect of profit brings in a host of new suppliers. With time, the market rewards those who sell good products and punishes those who sell poor ones; with time, the price settles so that it allocates products most efficiently to those who value them most.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and its advocates insist that it applies even in a crisis. In 2012, for instance, researchers at the University of Chicago asked eminent economists for their opinions on Connecticut\u2019s plan to outlaw price-gouging \u2013 exploitatively high prices \u2013 during floods or other weather cataclysms. Seventy-seven <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JwfFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=connecticut+2012+price+gouging+weather&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DpDYaMSZDs&amp;sig=ACfU3U1edKBXJpI4IT5ntHyRR69cgTO2eQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVkrK1rfnoAhWyunEKHXzbDm0Q6AEwB3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=connecticut%202012%20price%20gouging%20weather&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">percent</a> of the economists thought that governments shouldn\u2019t curb or interfere with prices \u2013 that, all things considered, the best way to get vital goods to those who needed them was to put no reins on the market at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Vogel/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But this pandemic has provided a huge weight of evidence to the contrary: tales <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/coronavirus-indonesia-seizes-half-a-million-masks-amid-panic-buying\" title=\"\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/brooklyn-coronavirus-price-gouging.html\" title=\"\">hoarders</a>, of doctors and nurses so short of protective gear that some wore <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nurse-at-brooklyn-hospital-on-coronavirus-protective-clothing-its-a-garbage-bag-its-like-something-out-of-the-twlight-zone-2020-04-07\" title=\"\">bin bags</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\" title=\"\">snorkels</a>, and of deals so desperate that a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-trump-administration-paid-a-bankrupt-company-with-zero-employees-2455-million-for-n95-masks-which-its-never-manufactured/ar-BB12JwUk\" title=\"\">security training company</a>, bankrupt for months and with no employees, somehow won a $55m contract to supply masks. These failures happen, in part, because ordinarily the market\u2019s idea of efficiency involves getting products to those willing to pay the most for them. In a crisis, or even outside of one, that isn\u2019t the same as getting products to the maximum possible number of people who need them.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have always thought that economists were obsessed with efficiency, no matter what happened to distribution,\u201d Angus Deaton, the Nobel-winning economist, told me. But distribution is what matters, particularly in an emergency. During this pandemic, the best scenario for everyone would be to get masks to doctors and nurses first \u2013 \u201cwe want to keep them well, so that they can save our lives and the lives of others,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies periods of panic and uncertainty. But high prices in unregulated markets keeps masks out of reach for the hospitals that need them. By the time the market culls bad suppliers, stabilises the price and compels hoarders to sell, the disease has spread and people have died.</p> \n<p>Solving this, Bloom said, requires a hand on the tiller: steering the market in ways that classical economists tend to dislike. One strategy is to cap prices so that they don\u2019t become exorbitant but still offer the kind of profits that draw new manufacturers in. Bloom also thinks governments should requisition masks for their health services first, before allowing the rest into the market. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from how food was rationed during the world wars. Or how Britain bought tanks from Vickers during the second world war. It didn\u2019t have to take over the firm. It just offered a fair price. This is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is like an economy in wartime.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>For anyone who views the prevailing international order as a brutish contest for resources, disguised occasionally by noble words and fine treaties, the scramble for masks offers a perfect little parable. It has taken on the appearance of a zero-sum struggle straight out of a game-theory seminar: with limited supply and endless demand, one mask for you is one mask less for me. To this austere truth, nations have reacted in familiar ways; amid the novel chaos created by Covid-19, old enmities and hardened habits reassert themselves.</p> \n<p>So when, in early April, news anchors in Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/covid-19-china-buffoons-all-weather-ally-pakistan-by-sending-underwear-masks-120040500163_1.html\" title=\"\">complained</a> that China had sent their country masks made out of underwear, Indian nationalists on Twitter launched a mocking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/underwear_mask_for_pakistan\" title=\"\">hashtag</a>. A couple of weeks before that, when British tabloids reported on French border guards impounding two trucks of masks earmarked for the NHS, it confirmed the worst suspicions of every Eurosceptic. \u201cThis shows you all you need to know about European cooperation,\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and ardent Brexiter, told the Sun. When the EU did<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\" title=\"\"> invite Britain to take part</a> in a bulk purchase of protective apparel and ventilators, though, the government passed. The reason appears to be either the stubbornness of its Brexit spirit or its ineptitude in checking its email; both seem equally possible under Boris Johnson\u2019s government.</p> \n<p>The US, for its part, treated the procurement of masks as a smash-and-grab operation. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/global-battle-coronavirus-equipment-masks-tests\" title=\"\">April</a>, an incredible account emerged of Americans brandishing cash on the runway of a Shanghai airport, buying up a cargo of masks that was already on a plane, ready to fly out to France. No one quite clarified who these Americans were, or how they barged onto the runway, but the episode enraged French officials. In its wake, Renaud Muselier, the president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, chose to bring his masks home by sea. \u201cAt least that way, I can be sure nobody will steal my masks from the tarmac,\u201d he told a French TV station.</p> \n<p>The US was also accused of waylaying masks in Bangkok before they flew on to Germany, and of blocking the delivery of 3m American-made masks to Canada. Last month, Ovidiu Olea, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, purchased 50,000 sets of masks, gloves and coveralls, which he planned to donate to the health service in his native Romania. \u201cEverything else was ready, and then my coveralls supplier called to say that some Americans showed up, paid three times the price, and bought my order out from under my nose,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schlueter/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the EU, relations between member nations have prickled with tension over the lack of masks and other gear. By the end of February, there were more than 1,000 coronavirus cases across Italy, and it needed more protective gear \u2013 masks in particular. Around that time, a legislator in Italy\u2019s coalition government told me, France and Germany implemented national laws that declared masks as strategic assets, which meant that if masks were transiting through these countries, bound for elsewhere, they could be appropriated. For a while, she said, France and Germany kept hold of some masks that Italy had ordered from India, Turkey and Vietnam.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn those darkest moments, China stepped in and offered 200,000 masks as a present,\u201d the legislator said. A plane landed in Rome, carrying masks and gear but also traditional Chinese herbs: an exercise in what has come to be known as \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d. Not long afterwards, France and Germany lifted their mask seizure laws and sent free masks to Italy. But by that point, the legislator said, \u201cthe damage had been done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since then, Italy has bought more than 20m masks from China, but China has been expert at projecting these sales as an extension of its benevolence. The Chinese government now buys full newspaper pages for advertorials that laud its assistance to Italy. After we spoke, the legislator texted me an opinion poll by an Italian thinktank, in which 52% of respondents named China as Italy\u2019s best friend. \u201cLook at the list of enemies,\u201d she wrote. On top: Germany at 45% and then France at 38%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alarming,\u201d she said, \u201chow the public isn\u2019t seeing that European institutions are actually doing a lot for Italy.\u201d Germany reserved dozens of intensive-care beds for Italians, flew them in for treatment and delivered ventilators to Italian hospitals; France sent hundreds of thousands of protective suits. But China\u2019s mask diplomacy has fanned a mistrust of the EU kindled years ago by Italy\u2019s populists. The legislator sounded despondent. \u201cI wish I could say this mask diplomacy isn\u2019t working very well. But it is, unfortunately.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Whatever the new normal is after this pandemic, everyone I spoke with agreed on one thing: there will be masks. Lots and lots of masks. They\u2019ll be handed out on airlines and at hotels; they\u2019ll be stacked next to the till at Boots; they\u2019ll be stashed in sock drawers and linen closets in practically every home. Every country will produce and stockpile its own supply, unwilling to rely any more on the vagaries of the international market; Germany, forever ahead of the curve, has already <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200408/highly-likely-that-face-mark-requirement-will-come-to-germany-says-bavarian-president\" title=\"\">begun</a>.</p> \n<p>We already guessed, before the pandemic, that one version of our future would entail masks for billions of us. It\u2019s the version in which we keep burning carbon, polluting our air and aggravating global warming so much that our land keeps going up in flames. But that still felt distant enough to be somewhat avoidable. We could hope that, however slowly or inexpertly, countries would pool their energies to stop this. Now, though, the age of masks has arrived sooner than we anticipated, brought on by an entirely different threat altogether. And the manner of its arrival carries a warning: that with the world as it is, the solidarity needed to battle climate change may be impossible to secure, and that the future of smoky skies and rising seas is the only one that lies ahead of us.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system | Adam Tooze</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ovidiu Olea\u2019s mask machine arrived from China on the third Monday of April.

  "<p>Two days before Ireland went into lockdown, David\u2019s wife, Maureen, went into a hospice. He stayed there with her for 10 days until she died on 3 April, ending her seven-year illness with the neurodegenerative disorder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2013/may/07/msa-memories-daughter-video\">multiple system atrophy</a>. Two days later, she was taken to a funeral home and cremated; under the lockdown rules, David was unable to attend the ceremony.</p> <p>\u201cThe hearse simply drove down our road and the neighbours all came out to clap for her,\u201d he says over the phone from his home in Kerry, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cThat was how I said goodbye after 48 years of us being together.\u201d David is now living alone, experiencing both isolation and loneliness for the first time in half a century.</p> <p>As the global pandemic has brought a host of new experiences, including working from home, home-schooling and online socialising, it has also, unsurprisingly, increased the loneliness of many people. Some may have felt socially isolated before physical distancing began, while others, such as David, are having to cope with life-altering experiences on their own.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af75b01f3857abe56f89b0c441e34f2481e6ab6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af75b01f3857abe56f89b0c441e34f2481e6ab6d/0_44_900_1556/578.jpg\" alt=\"Maureen and David Chalmers in September 2018.\" width=\"578\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maureen and David Chalmers in September 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by David Chalmers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pamela Qualter, a professor of psychology for education at the University of Manchester, defines loneliness as \u201cnot necessarily about being on your own, but about feeling a disconnect with other people \u2013 a sense that the relationships you have aren\u2019t satisfying your emotional needs,\u201d she says. \u201cLoneliness is a subjective experience, so it\u2019s not always obvious to us. There are some people who are currently isolated who will not get lonely and there are others who will really struggle.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Qualter led <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2yzhfv4DvqVp5nZyxBD8G23/who-feels-lonely-the-results-of-the-world-s-largest-loneliness-study\">a BBC study into loneliness</a> among the British public that found that, out of the 55,000 respondents, a third said they often feel lonely. It is a situation she believes is being exacerbated by the lockdown. \u201cOur isolation is going to trigger loneliness in many people, some who might never have experienced it for extended periods of time before,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might be with your family and feel lonely, since we fall into different roles and hide parts of ourselves with family, or you might feel lonely even if you are video-calling constantly, as that can sometimes emphasise our distance from others.\u201d</p> <p>At 76 years old, David is among those most vulnerable to loneliness and its associated mental health consequences. Calls to the older people\u2019s helpline the Silver Line have increased by 31% since the outbreak of coronavirus in the UK. In the weeks since Maureen\u2019s death, though, he has been finding new ways to cope. \u201cI\u2019ve been tending to the garden and going for walks with our dog, Titch,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve also been chatting to the neighbours over the fence and I\u2019ve taken up painting again \u2013 I used to be a landscape painter, but it felt wrong to be doing it when Maureen was seriously ill. It\u2019s such a wonderful thing to be able to lose myself in now, though.\u201d</p> <p>He has also found a way to memorialise Maureen without having had the chance to spread her ashes. \u201cI keep her on a table in the living room with a picture and every time I go out I touch the box and tell her what I\u2019m up to,\u201d he says. \u201cTowards the end, when she couldn\u2019t speak, she wrote on a beach stone that she loves me; I have that there, too \u2013 it\u2019s one of my most precious possessions.\u201d</p> <p>David was one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/17/have-you-experienced-loneliness-in-coronavirus-lockdown\">more than 100 respondents to a Guardian callout</a> on how readers are coping with loneliness during the lockdown. They ranged from university students struggling to adapt to moving back in with their large families to people who had moved abroad for work and are now stuck isolating in a foreign country alone, from parents feeling lonely while attempting to homeschool their children to newly single people.</p> <p>\u201cI have a four-month-old baby at home and, even though my partner and my parents are here, I\u2019m struggling to cope with the lockdown,\u201d says Nadia (not her real name). \u201cI\u2019ve always loved being around people and I\u2019m so fortunate to have my beautiful baby and such family support, but it\u2019s still so easy to slip into a sense of loneliness.\u201d</p> <p>Brian Turner, a psychotherapist at the Counselling Directory, defines this situation as \u201cemotional loneliness \u2026 This is like the scene you get in a film where someone is singled out in a crowd, held at a standstill when others are moving all around them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt shows you that loneliness is an emotional disconnect, not merely a physical distance.\u201d</p> <p>Turner recommends trying to connect with at least one other person and making space for privacy if you are living in a shared home. \u201cYou need to both try to keep up your communication, to tell people if you need space and then also have somewhere to withdraw to,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re built on connection as humans, so isolation can be a confusing time, but if you can build a routine into your day and prioritise your mental health, that will be very important.\u201d</p> <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have already been calling for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">studies into the mental health effects</a> of coronavirus, which they say is \u201cclearly having a major social and psychological impact on the whole population\u201d. For Nadia, her weekly online therapy sessions have been a much-needed outlet. \u201cI was lucky that, when I signed up for free NHS counselling, it finally came through after the lockdown started,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been finding it really helpful talking to my counsellor about my anxieties. She recommended I use a mindfulness app each day, which has been a godsend.\u201d She has also been listening to podcasts, which help create a sense of conversation around her, and watching lots of TV.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"76bbf6574c1566dc4a5de37f8724acc4ea16ce50\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76bbf6574c1566dc4a5de37f8724acc4ea16ce50/0_97_2316_2895/800.jpg\" alt=\"Capella.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Capella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Capella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the lockdown began, the artist Capella was accustomed to being alone. \u201cI would spend the week painting or making things at home, and then when the weekend came I would be down at the market just chatting with everyone I knew,\u201d she says. But with the lockdown and the beginning of chemotherapy treatment after a breast cancer diagnosis in December 2019, things have changed rapidly. \u201cIt\u2019s been really difficult adapting to the lockdown, because such a big part of my life was just talking to strangers and meeting new people, but now it feels like that has all been put on hold,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve been alone before, but this loneliness is new.\u201d</p> <p>Capella has taken solace in an unlikely place: her chemotherapy nurses. \u201cI have developed a friendship with the nurses at the Royal Marsden when I go once a week to have my catheter flushed,\u201d she says. \u201cTo be remembered by a nurse who has her own busy life is such a gift. It\u2019s so lovely to be thought of by someone else; it makes me feel like more than just my diagnosis.\u201d</p> <p>Another unexpected upside has come from a rekindled relationship with her 16-year-old daughter, who lives with her father in Denmark. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take my cancer diagnosis too well and we found it hard to speak for a while,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now that she\u2019s in lockdown we\u2019re texting and video-calling all the time. It\u2019s so nice that I\u2019m not having to make videos telling her how to live her life after I\u2019m gone, but rather we can have video calls about online shopping and having fun.\u201d</p> <p>For NHS workers such as Charlotte, 28, a physiotherapist, working in a hospital has been a saving grace, even though it might be more fraught than normal. \u201cI live on my own and I quite like it usually, but the lockdown has let loneliness creep in,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has been so useful being able to go to work every day. Even though it\u2019s stressful \u2013 particularly for my colleagues who are on the frontline \u2013 we chat to each other and keep our spirits up knowing that we\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d</p> <p>Whereas previously her colleagues might not have spoken so readily about their mental health, Charlotte believes the coronavirus pandemic has led to a need for greater help. \u201cThe chaplaincy team at the hospital has been amazing throughout this and we\u2019ve all been talking quite openly about the support we might require. It\u2019s made us all very empathetic to each other\u2019s needs.\u201d</p> <p>Capella says that this empathy has been a positive side-effect of the lockdown. \u201cWhen I have managed to chat to people on my way into the hospital, I\u2019ve been so pleasantly surprised to hear them talking about their anxieties \u2013 it\u2019s something we\u2019re all so shy about usually,\u201d she says. Kate Shurety, the executive director for <a href=\"https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/\">the Campaign to End Loneliness</a>, agrees. \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing now is what thousands of older people experience all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable lesson that we should all make an effort to help others when they don\u2019t need to be in that situation and we can use this time to try and build links to our community \u2013 something that often gets neglected in big cities.\u201d</p> <p>While the widespread use of video-calling and messaging has been a key feature of lockdown, it can have its pitfalls, even for the younger generation. Jake, 21, is self-isolating alone in his student house in Manchester and using video-calling to stay in touch with friends and family each day. \u201cWe play online quizzes and sometimes even eat our meals together over the screen, but it can be exhausting,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s because there\u2019s no background atmosphere so you\u2019re always trying to fill the silences and also not talk over each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"01f22d09b6b847ffeaa316312c4c55bf70846fd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01f22d09b6b847ffeaa316312c4c55bf70846fd4/0_0_3898_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"loneliness illo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Turner says video-calling sometimes has a disassociating effect \u2013 one where you can \u201czone out\u201d of your interaction as your mind becomes confused by the lack of physical connection, despite the visual one. \u201cWe have the most technology at the moment, but possibly also the most loneliness,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep everything in moderation, otherwise you can develop an information overload with too much contact and not enough to say.\u201d</p> <p>For Jake, there are also financial concerns around the related consequences of the pandemic. He experienced coronavirus symptoms as the lockdown began and decided to isolate at university rather than return to his father\u2019s house. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I worked enough last summer to build up savings to keep me here, otherwise I\u2019d have nowhere to go,\u201d he says. \u201cThe biggest concern among my friends is not really about getting seriously ill, but about how we\u2019ll afford to return to uni or get a job when we graduate, as there\u2019s just no work at the moment. Plus, we\u2019re still spending money on data plans for video-calling and online subscriptions, so I\u2019m not sure how long this can all last.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, returning to an analogue lifestyle has been helping to keep his anxieties at bay. \u201cWeirdly enough, I\u2019ve been getting into quilting and am finding it very therapeutic, adding a bit every day to my wonky design,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been making sure to exercise a little each day to stick to some kind of routine, otherwise the weeks just bleed into each other.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, this is a difficult time for almost everyone \u2013 and acknowledging that is important. \u201cIf you are not struggling a bit at the moment, you possibly haven\u2019t understood the severity of what is going on,\u201d says the life coach Michael Bungay Stanier. \u201cOur brains hate uncertainty \u2013 we associate it with risk \u2013 and now we\u2019re being forced to live it. It\u2019s important to be kind to yourself and not feel like we should fill this time with lists of new year resolutions. Just coping is enough.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps David, for all that he has already been through, has the answer. \u201cLife is for living and you have to keep going,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen Maureen was unable to speak towards the end of her illness, that was real loneliness. But she would still smile and I know that she would want me to keep going now, too. So when this is all over, I\u2019m going to buy a little caravan and do a bit of travelling. It\u2019s important to enjoy things while you can and keep reminding yourself that this, too, shall pass.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A total of 50.8 million people around the world were recorded as internally displaced last year, forced from their homes by conflict and disaster. This is the highest number ever, and 10 million more than in 2018.</p> <p>Annual <a href=\"https://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2020/\">statistics published</a> by the Norwegian Refugee Council\u2019s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) calculated that by the end of 2019, 45.7 million people were internally displaced \u2013 effectively becoming refugees in their own country \u2013 as a result of violence in 61 countries. An additional 5.1 million people in 96 countries had been displaced by disasters.</p> <p>Alexandra Bilak, the IDMC director, said she had hoped internal displacement would receive more global attention this year, following the launch in October of a <a href=\"https://disasterdisplacement.org/press-release-by-co-chairs-of-the-un-secretary-generals-high-level-panel-on-internal-displacement-on-commencement-of-work\">UN high-level panel</a> to address the problem and find long-term solutions. The panel held its first meeting in February.</p> <p>However, Covid-19 was expected to shift focus away, she said. \u201cWe were so hoping this year would be really the wake-up call to the international community, with the new high-level panel on internal displacement. We thought this year would be the year of internal displacement,\u201d said Bilak.</p> <p>She said it was too early to assess the full impact of the coronavirus on displacement and the efforts to address it, but was worried about future funding.</p> <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re about to plunge into a recession, of course it\u2019s going to have an impact on the generosity of donor governments,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really bad situation for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Bilak added there was great concern for the safety of people who have been displaced. \u201cIDPs (internally displaced people) are often highly vulnerable people living in crowded camps, emergency shelters and informal settlements with little or no access to healthcare. The global coronavirus pandemic will make them more vulnerable still. It will compromise their already precarious living conditions, by further limiting their access to essential services and humanitarian aid.\u201d</p> <p>Bilak said the Norwegian Refugee Council and other humanitarian agencies were already reporting that government restrictions were affecting the delivery of aid.</p> <p>The report, published on Tuesday, showed that the majority of new cases of displacement last year were in poorer countries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/10/global-neglect-of-millions-forced-from-their-homes-by-conflict-branded-pitiful\">Global neglect of millions forced from their homes by conflict branded 'pitiful'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The highest number were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa, where escalating violence and deteriorating security in the Sahel and ongoing conflict in Somalia and South Sudan continued to drive hundreds of thousands from their homes.</p> <p>Tropical storms and monsoon rains in south and east Asia and the Pacific had also displaced millions.

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

Biden\u2019s campaign has denied the allegation. </p> \n  <p>In an interview with Business Insider, a former neighbor of Reade\u2019s said Reade shared details of the alleged assault with her in the mid-1990s.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it,\u201d the neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, told the website.</p> \n  <p>The other woman, Lorraine Sanchez, a colleague of Reade\u2019s in the office of a California state senator in the mid-1990s, told the website that she remembers Reade complaining that she had been fired after complaining about a former boss in Washington DC who had sexually harassed her.</p> \n  <p>In April 2019, Reade was among several women who came forward to accuse Biden of inappropriate behavior or conduct that made them feel uncomfortable. But last month, in a podcast interview with progressive media host Katie Halper, Reade made a much more serious allegation. </p> \n  <p>She said Biden cornered her in a semi-private corridor on Capitol Hill, pinned her against the wall and digitally penetrated her. She repeated the story to The Intercept, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Reade\u2019s brother and a friend who has remained anonymous have confirmed aspects of her story.

  "<p>A major economic downturn, like the one we now face, devastates the lives of ordinary people. We lose our jobs, our homes and our futures. Yet, statistically, the recessions that shatter our dreams also improve health and increase longevity.</p> <p>It sounds crazy but it\u2019s true.</p> <p>In the 1920s, economists William F Ogburn and Dorothy S Thomas first noted mortality rates decreased during recessions. In subsequent research, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/44/5/1484/2594593\">Thomas confirmed their initial findings</a>, writing that \u201cin both England and the USA, a high death rate is associated with periods of prosperity and a low death rate with periods of [economic] depression\u201d.</p> <p>This counterintuitive trend has been noted by researchers ever since.</p> <p>In 1977, for instance, Joseph Eyer published a paper strikingly titled <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/832936\">Prosperity as a Cause of Death</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe general death rate rises during business booms,\u201d he said flatly, \u201cand falls during depressions.\u201d</p> <p>More recently, Veronica Toffolutti and Marc Suhrcke <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261519806_Assessing_the_short_term_health_impact_of_the_Great_Recession_in_the_European_Union_A_cross-country_panel_analysis\">analysed data from 23 countries</a> and concluded that \u201can increase in the unemployment rate during the Great Recession [or GFC] has had a beneficial health effect on average across EU countries\u201d.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://brooklynrail.org/2014/10/field-notes/health-and-economic-crises-in-conversation-with-jos-tapia\">interview </a>for the Brooklyn Rail, economist Jos\u00e9 Tapia explains that recessions change how we live. With overtime \u2013 and working hours as a whole \u2013 cut back, people can sleep more and take more exercise. They smoke and drink less; they relax more; they spend less time with dangerous industrial equipment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/a-quick-return-to-normal-in-australia-with-no-covid-19-vaccine-would-risk-lives-and-the-economy\">A quick return to normal in Australia \u2013 with no Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 would risk lives and the economy | Chris Edmond and Richard Holden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The reduced numbers of people driving (either to work or for work) lowers the road toll and disperses carcinogenic fumes. Other <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2009/09/upside-recessions\">researchers</a> have argued that recessions might bring people together to support each other \u2013 creating strong social networks that foster better health.</p> <p>But if booms tend to foster, as Toffolutti and Suhrcke say, \u201cmostly adverse health consequences\u201d, that doesn\u2019t mean we should welcome economic crashes.</p> <p>On the contrary, the equally robust relationship between unemployment and suicide illustrates just how traumatic recessions can be. If we can\u2019t afford alcohol and tobacco we might live longer but poverty-induced restrictions do not bring happiness, any more than the prolonged lifespan of captive animals induces enthusiasm for cages.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the link between recession and longevity should encourage us to think about our economy and its logic.</p> <p>The pioneer sociologist Max Weber pointed out that, until very recently, even the most exploitative labour had been given meaning by complex webs of human relationships. It\u2019s only with capitalism, Weber says, that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Economic acquisition is no longer subordinated to man as the means for the satisfaction of his material needs. This reversal of what we should call the natural relationship, so irrational from a naive point of view, is evidently as definitely a leading principle of capitalism as it is foreign to all peoples not under capitalistic influence.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>For instance, Indigenous people, who typically devoted no more than three or four hours each day to seeking food, found the European system of wage labour utterly incomprehensible.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t simply the long hours of the British working day that appalled them but also the notion of work stripped of ceremony, meaning and purpose astonished Indigenous people. Henry Reynolds describes how \u201cthe historical record bristles with colonists\u2019 complaints about their problems in trying to get Aborigines to behave as \u2018voluntary labourers for wages\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey do not court a life of labour,\u201d explained a Victorian Justice of the Peace of the Indigenous people he knew in 1849. \u201c[T]hat of our shepherds and hut-keepers \u2013 our splitters or bullock drivers \u2013 appears to them one of unmeaning toil, and they would by no means consent to exchange their free unhoused condition for the monotonous drudgery of such a dreary existence.\u201d</p> <p>That attitude was not a peculiar quirk of Indigenous society.</p> <p>In Europe, too, the normalisation of the wage system depended on massive violence: in essence, the forcible dispossession of people from their traditional holdings, so that they had no choice but to seek an employer. Even then, the early industrialists complained (in a language very similar to that used by white settlers about Indigenous people) of how their new employees still yearned for the old customs that had once given their lives meaning.</p> <p>The factory owner Samuel Greg Junior vented about the \u201crestless and migratory spirit\u201d of his workers; the entrepreneur Thomas Arkwright bemoaned the difficulty in training staff \u201cto renounce their desultory habits of work and identify themselves with the unvarying regularity of the complex automaton\u201d.</p> <p>If Arkwright was indifferent to the human desires of his staff, he also didn\u2019t care about those who bought his products \u2013 except insofar as they paid him. Where feudalism rests on rights and obligations, a capitalist factory relates to the world through money.</p> <p>Furthermore, that money \u2013 or, at least, most of it \u2013 must get ploughed back into the business, since competition means companies that don\u2019t reinvest fall behind their rivals.</p> <p>With every business driven to expand or die, growth becomes the paramount imperative. It\u2019s only under capitalism that indefinite economic increase becomes both conceivable (since money can always grow) and necessary (since without expansion the system begins to fall apart).</p> <p>Experts say the recession associated with Covid-19 might mean the biggest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/12/global-carbon-emisions-could-fall-by-record-25bn-tonnes-in-2020\">drop in demand for fossil fuels on record</a>, with lockdown conditions drastically slashing air and passenger transport.</p> <p>Yet this significant decline in greenhouse gases does not constitute good environmental news, since the crisis will almost certainly derail what was, until recently, a burgeoning momentum for climate action.</p> <p>Governments previously under pressure to respond to global warming will instead devote themselves single-mindedly to restarting their economies \u2013 and, once the wheels of industry begin spinning, emission levels will recommence their inexorable climb.</p> <p>The degradation of labour and the degradation of the planet emerge from a similar source: an economic system that strips any control of production from ordinary people and instead operates according to a logic of relentless and destructive accumulation.</p> <p>Without constant growth, capitalism descends into crisis. Yet the carcinogenic expansion on which our prosperity depends places more and more strain on our world \u2013 and, indeed, on us.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>In the public mind, the origin story of coronavirus seems well fixed: in late 2019 someone at the now world-famous Huanan seafood market in Wuhan was infected with a virus from an animal.</p> <p>The rest is part of an awful history still in the making, with Covid-19 spreading from that first cluster in the capital of China\u2019s Hubei province to a pandemic that has killed about 211,000 people so far.</p> <p>Stock footage of pangolins \u2013 a scaly mammal that looks like an anteater \u2013 have made it on to news bulletins, suggesting this animal was the staging post for the virus before it spread to humans.</p> <p>But there is uncertainty about several aspects of the Covid-19 origin story that scientists are trying hard to unravel, including which species passed it to a human. They\u2019re trying hard because knowing how a pandemic starts is a key to stopping the next one.</p> <p>Prof Stephen Turner, head of the department of microbiology at Melbourne\u2019s Monash University, says what\u2019s most likely is that virus originated in bats.</p> <p>But that\u2019s where his certainty ends, he says.</p> <p>On the hypothesis that the virus emerged at the Wuhan live animal market from an interaction between an animal and a human, Turner says: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s conclusive by any means.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPart of the problem is that the information is only as good as the surveillance,\u201d he says, adding that viruses of this type are circulating all the time in the animal kingdom.</p> <p>The fact that the virus has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/bronx-zoo-tiger-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">infected a tiger in a New York zoo</a> shows how viruses can move around between species, he says. \u201cUnderstanding the breadth of species this virus can infect is important as it helps us narrow down down where it might have come from.\u201d</p> <p>Scientists say it is highly likely that the virus came from bats but first passed through an intermediary animal in the same way that another coronavirus \u2013 the 2002 Sars outbreak \u2013 moved from horseshoe bats to cat-like civets before infecting humans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5411ce3c689a89810414262056ebd5d93da5937e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5411ce3c689a89810414262056ebd5d93da5937e/126_0_3733_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pangolin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pangolins are \u2018the most illegally traded mammal in the world\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Themba Hadebe/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One animal implicated as an intermediary host between bats and humans is the pangolin. The <a href=\"https://www.iucn.org/content/eating-pangolins-extinction\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> says they are \u201cthe most illegally traded mammal in the world\u201d and are prized for their meat and the claimed medicinal properties of their scales.</p> <p>As reported in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00364-2\">Nature</a>, pangolins were not listed on the inventory of items being sold in Wuhan, although this omission could be deliberate as it\u2019s illegal to sell them.</p> <p>\u201cWhether the poor pangolin was the species at which it jumped, it\u2019s not clear,\u201d Turner says. \u201cIt\u2019s either mixed in something else, mixed in a poor pangolin, or it\u2019s jumped into people and evolved in people.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Edward Holmes, of the University of Sydney, was a co-author on a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">Nature study</a> that examined the likely origins of the virus by looking at its genome. On social media he has stressed that the identity of the species that served as an intermediate host for the virus is \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/edwardcholmes/status/1246237549556686848?s=20\">still uncertain</a>\u201d.</p> <p>One <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457920300496\">statistical study</a> looked at a characteristic of the virus that evolved to enable it to latch on to human cells. Pangolins were able to develop this characteristic, but so were cats, buffalo, cattle, goats, sheep and pigeons.</p> <p>Another <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25731\">study claimed</a> to have ruled out pangolins as an intermediary altogether, because samples of similar viruses taken from pangolins lacked a chain of amino acids seen in the virus now circulating in humans.</p> <p>The study Holmes worked on suggested that the scenario in which a human at the Wuhan market interacted with an animal that carried the virus was only one potential version of the Covid-19 origin story. Another was the possibility that a descendent of the virus jumped into humans and then adapted as it was passed from human to human.</p> <p>\u201cOnce acquired, these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it,\u201d the study said.</p> <p>Analysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30183-5/fulltext#%20\">medical journal the Lancet</a> found that 27 of them had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. But the same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not.</p> <p>This might be another reason to doubt the established story.</p> <p>Prof Stanley Perlman, a leading immunologist at the University of Iowa and an expert on previous coronavirus outbreaks that have stemmed from animals, says the idea the link to the Wuhan market is coincidental \u201ccannot be ruled out\u201d but that possibility \u201cseems less likely\u201d because the genetic material of the virus had been found in the market environment.</p> <p>Perlman told Guardian Australia he does believe there was an intermediary animal but adds that while pangolins are possible candidates, they \u201care not proven to be the key intermediary\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that any evolution [of the virus] occurred in the intermediate animal if there was one. There has been no substantial changes in the virus in the three months of the pandemic, indicating that the virus is well adapted to humans.\u201d</p> <p>So-called wet markets \u2013 where live animals are traded \u2013 have been <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14738798\">implicated in previous outbreaks of coronaviruses</a>, in particular Sars.</p> <p>Dr Michelle Baker, an immunologist at CSIRO who studies viruses in bats, says some of the research on Covid-19\u2019s origins have stepped off from what was known from the past.</p> <p>But \u201cwe really don\u2019t know\u201d how accurate the origin story is, she says: \u201cThere\u2019s some sort of connection [to the Wuhan market] and there were people exposed to the market that were infected.\u201d</p> <p>Baker says what is \u201cvery likely\u201d is that the virus originated in a bat. \u201cIt\u2019s a likely scenario but we will never know. The market was cleaned up quite quickly. We can only speculate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese wet markets have been identified as an issue because you do have species interacting,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to highlight the dangers of them and an opportunity to clamp down on them.\u201d</p> <p>Turner adds: \u201cWe\u2019ve found the ancestors of the virus, but having broader knowledge of the coronavirus in other species might give us a hint about the evolution of this thing and how it jumped.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.
