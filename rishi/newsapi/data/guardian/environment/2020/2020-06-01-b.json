  "<p>Ministers have been accused of not taking seriously the threat posed to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) Britons by Covid-19, after the release of an official review of the issue was delayed.</p> <p>The report was commissioned to analyse how factors such as ethnicity, obesity and gender can affect people\u2019s vulnerability to Covid-19 but has already missed the publication deadline set for the end of May. Health bosses sought \u201cinsight\u201d after it was reported that deaths among BAME communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/inquiry-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-bame\">were disproportionately high</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unacceptable that this review should be delayed without a given date for its publication. BAME communities need answers,\u201d said Marsha de Cordova, the shadow women and equalities secretary.</p> <p>Announcing the review\u2019s launch in early May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cWe recognise that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away, especially among care workers and those in the NHS.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday night, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over the death of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck.</p> <p>\u201cMinisters received initial findings today. They are being rapidly considered and a report will be published this week,\u201d a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Citing an unnamed government source, Sky News had reported that the review\u2019s release had been pushed back because of \u201cworries\u201d around \u201ccurrent global events\u201d.</p> <p>The source was quoted as saying there were concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d, where protesters are demanding an end to police violence against black people. The source reportedly said it would be a \u201cbad combination\u201d if the review was released amid such tensions.</p> <p>PHE would initially say only that the \u201creport will be published shortly\u201d. DHSC later added: \u201cIt is not true to say this has been delayed due to global events.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

  "<p>Everybody remembers how it ended. From 1990 to 2004, Parma competed as one of Italy\u2019s foremost teams, qualifying for Europe in 14 consecutive seasons and winning four pieces of continental silverware. Then their parent company and chief sponsor, Parmalat, collapsed amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jan/04/corporatefraud.parmalat2\">one of the most staggering financial fraud scandals </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jan/04/corporatefraud.parmalat2\">the world has ever known</a>.</p> <p>Parma avoided instant oblivion. Technically the club did fold, but a subtly renamed version sprung up in its place, taking over the contracts, debts and \u2013 crucially \u2013 Serie A status of its predecessor.</p> <p>Still, the wax in Parma\u2019s Icarus wings had started to melt. They did not compete for major honours in the decade that followed, sneaking into the Uefa Cup only once, in 2006, after Juventus, Fiorentina and Lazio were all docked points as a result of the Calciopoli scandal. In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/19/italian-court-declares-parma-bankrupt\">Parma went bankrupt</a>. This time, they would have to start over from Serie D.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2020/may/28/nottingham-forest-retained-european-cup-40-years-ago\">When Nottingham Forest retained the European Cup 40 years ago</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their rapid return to the top flight, with three promotions in as many seasons, has been a sensational story. But the part of this tale that gets told less often is where it all began. Not with Parmalat, but with a man named Ernesto Ceresini, who became the club\u2019s president in 1976.</p> <p>Parma were playing in the third tier of Italian football \u2013 then known as Serie C \u2013 and had never been higher than the second. No more was expected for a team from a town of 200,000 people, where baseball, volleyball and cycling all competed for sports fans\u2019 interest.</p> <p>Ceresini, a local businessman who made his money in construction, is said to have bought into Parma almost as a means of distraction: seeking new purpose after his wife died. But his appointment of Arrigo Sacchi as manager in 1985 would be a turning point. The former shoe salesman had just secured promotion from Serie C for Rimini and took Parma up at the first attempt. He followed that up in his second season by beating Milan twice at San Siro in the Coppa Italia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f645a2b7e1f08508f53400d3637c31d52bd1cb9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f645a2b7e1f08508f53400d3637c31d52bd1cb9f/0_11_1914_1148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parma captain Fabio Cannavaro contests a header against Roma\u2019s Gabriel Batistuta in 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parma captain Fabio Cannavaro contests a header against Roma\u2019s Gabriel Batistuta in 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was at the end of that campaign, with Sacchi on his way to Milan, that Parmalat got involved, becoming the club\u2019s main sponsor and buying a small minority stake from Ceresini. The company was seen as an extraordinary success story \u2013 a local dairy operation that in just two decades had expanded into a global food conglomerate.</p> <p>Parma were about to experience a similarly explosive rise. Sacchi was succeeded briefly by Zdenek Zeman and then Giampiero Vitali, before Ceresini identified Nevio Scala in 1989 as the man to take them to the promised land. \u201cThe first thing he said to me was that he had a dream,\u201d the manager later recalled. \u201cHe wanted to see Parma in Serie A.\u201d</p> <p>Scala had narrowly failed to steer Reggina into the top flight that spring, finishing level on points with Cremonese in fourth but losing a promotion tie-breaker on penalties. He took Parma up at the first attempt. Devastatingly, that was still not soon enough for Ceresini, who died after a heart attack in February 1990.</p> <p>At the time, Parma were in a slump. They had taken a single point from their first five games of the year, and Scala wondered if the owner\u2019s death might spell the end of his tenure. \u201cI remember a meeting in the changing room with [Ceresini\u2019s son] Fulvio, who asked me if I wanted to carry on,\u201d remembered Scala in an interview with the Gazzetta di Parma. \u201cHe was the president now and if he had any doubts, he could easily have fired me. Instead he thought about it, remembered everything we discussed with his father, and extended my contract. It had an impact on the players, who despite all the problems of that moment, understood something important was happening.\u201d</p> <p>Parma secured promotion with victory over local rivals Reggiana on the penultimate weekend, reaching Serie A for the first time. Even then they could not have imagined what lay ahead. Fulvio Ceresini sold most of his stake in the club to Parmalat, and the new owners splashed out on three players who had impressed in that summer\u2019s World Cup in Italy: the Brazil goalkeeper Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel, Belgium defender Georges Gr\u00fcn and a young Swede named Tomas Brolin.</p> <p>In that first season of top-flight football Parma did not even have a fixed training location. The players travelled to the club\u2019s Tardini stadium every morning and got changed in the dressing rooms before boarding a bus \u2013 sometimes it would take them to facilities owned by another club, sometimes to whatever patch of council-owned land could be found in their home town or a neighbouring village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"179cdcc17f2bf4ec269b13279023257238651f4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/179cdcc17f2bf4ec269b13279023257238651f4e/103_139_1507_904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faustino Asprilla and Gianfranco Zola during the 1994 European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final against Arsenal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Faustino Asprilla and Gianfranco Zola during the 1994 European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final against Arsenal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps that was a factor in their success. \u201cIt was a team that was born right there, that grew up in the middle of a public park,\u201d said the defender Luigi Apolloni. \u201cThe whole city was involved together.\u201d</p> <p>The impact of Brolin was more objectively clear, a whirling dervish between the lines of midfield and attack in Scala\u2019s 3-5-1-1. Brolin scored seven goals in that first season, all the more memorable for his leaping pirouette celebrations. But more than that he lent his team energy and joy. Parma played on the front foot, their wing-backs encouraged to go forward in a way that was unheard of in Serie A back then.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/julien-faubert-to-madrid-the-surreal-transfer-tale-inspiring-a-tv-drama\">Julien Faubert to Madrid: the surreal transfer tale inspiring a TV drama</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They finished sixth and followed up in 1991-92 by winning the Coppa Italia, beating Juventus in the final. Scala knew it could be another turning point. \u201cWe didn\u2019t just win the Coppa Italia,\u201d he told Corriere della Sera. \u201cWe pulled off our greatest coup. Our players have understood that you can win here, and other players saw it too. In future, they will not view us as a provincial club with an uncertain future.\u201d</p> <p>That summer Parma added Faustino Asprilla, whose goals helped propel them to a more unlikely achievement still: winning the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup at the first time of asking in 1993. He scored four times in the competition, though ultimately wound up on the bench for the final against Royal Antwerp, with Brolin preferred in support of Alessandro Melli.</p> <p>Looking back on the team that triumphed that day, it is striking how many of Parma\u2019s starting XI were not recent additions. Melli, Apolloni, Marco Osio, Daniele Zoratto and the captain Lorenzo Minotti had all been with the club in Serie B. Minotti and Melli scored the first two of Parma\u2019s goals in a 3-1 win. Parmalat\u2019s money had played a part, but it was hardly the only ingredient.</p> <p>If anything, it was that first European triumph that prompted the owners to really start throwing money around. Parma spent 20bn Italian lira to acquire Gianfranco Zola from Napoli and Nestor Sensini from Udinese. In 1994 they beat Milan to win the Uefa Super Cup and reached the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final again, this time losing to Arsenal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>On it went, this dizzying and implausible chapter. Parma had signed Dino Baggio from Juventus, and he scored a goal in each leg of the 1995 Uefa Cup final against his former club, securing a 2-1 aggregate win. In their first five seasons as a top-flight club, Scala\u2019s team had claimed four major trophies.</p> <p>Although the deluge of silverware dried up, new signings continued to pour in. Parma landed a Ballon d\u2019Or winner, Hristo Stoichkov, together with Fabio Cannavaro and Pippo Inzaghi in 1995. A year later, Hern\u00e1n Crespo, Lilian Thuram and Enrico Chiesa arrived. In 1998, along came Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n. An outlandishly confident young goalkeeper, Gigi Buffon, emerged from the academy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"74fdef19bcd717ea652eca5f230d80bcccd94d28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74fdef19bcd717ea652eca5f230d80bcccd94d28/0_0_1866_1331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n holds off the challenge of Rangers\u2019 Rod Wallace during Parma\u2019s triumphant 1998-99 Uefa Cup campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n holds off the challenge of Rangers\u2019 Rod Wallace during Parma\u2019s triumphant 1998-99 Uefa Cup campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Livesey/Allsport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Parma team that won the Uefa Cup in 1999 might have boasted the most talented starting XI in Europe. Buffon in goal, Cannavaro, Thuram and Sensini at the back, Ver\u00f3n, Baggio and Alain Boghossian in midfield, Paolo Vanoli and Diego Fuser out wide and Crespo paired with Chiesa up front. They obliterated the competition, beating Bordeaux 7-2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 5-2 in the semis and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eORSCpiQRZM\">Marseille 3-0 in the final</a>.</p> <p>That team, managed by Alberto Malesani (Scala had moved on in 1996), remains the last Serie A representative to win what is now the Europa League. Parma paired the success with another Coppa Italia triumph and would raise the latter trophy for a third time in 2002.</p> <p>Then came Parmalat\u2019s collapse, a scandal with wide-reaching human consequences. Thousands of employees all over the world lost their livelihoods, along with countless more who relied on their business. None of this was any fault of Parma\u2019s footballing staff, yet their success is inescapably coloured by the knowledge that such a glorious team was assembled with money that did not exist. Perhaps that is why many Parma fans still hold most fondly to the memory of those earlier sides: to Melli, Minotti and Osio. And to Ernesto Ceresini, the owner whose dream became an extraordinary reality, too late for him to take part.</p> <p>This February, shortly after the anniversary of his death, a banner was unfurled by supporters at Parma\u2019s home game against Lazio. \u201cCeresini,\u201d it read simply, \u201cThe eternal president.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The sixth mass extinction of wildlife on Earth is accelerating, according to an analysis by scientists who warn it may be a tipping point for the collapse of civilisation.</p> <p>More than 500 species of land animals were found to be on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost within 20 years. In comparison, the same number were lost over the whole of the last century. Without the human destruction of nature, even this rate of loss would have taken thousands of years, the scientists said.</p> <p>The land vertebrates on the verge of extinction, with fewer than 1,000 individuals left, include&nbsp;the Sumatran rhino, the Clari\u00f3n wren, the Espa\u00f1ola giant tortoise and the harlequin frog.

We would like to reassure communities that this is absolutely not the case.<br><br>\u201cHowever, our use of stop and search over recent weeks has increased as additional resources have been placed into proactive patrols to tackle crime and keep London safe during this challenging period.\u201d</p> <p>Protesters say the demonstrations go much further than a protest against policing operations during lockdown.</p> <p>Another organiser, who wished to remain anonymous, said there had been widespread anger over recent government failures that had affected the BAME population.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a whole load of people who have directly been affected by the unlawful murders and unjust treatment of our brothers and sisters worldwide, but it\u2019s also more than that.

The British&nbsp;Transport&nbsp;Police announced last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/29/police-close-case-of-rail-workers-covid-19-death-after-spitting-incident\">no further action would be taken</a>.</p> <p>Edan, 17, who plans to attend the next wave of protests in London, said events over the past decade had awoken her generation to widespread inequalities in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s forcing people to see we live completely different lives, even if we live in the same area and go to the same school. We are leading two completely different realities.\u201d</p> <p>The Met said there were 23 arrests at the demonstrations in London on Sunday. \u201cThe arrests were for a variety of offences including breaching the Covid-19 legislation, assault on an emergency worker, possession of an offensive weapon and breach of the peace. The ages of those arrested ranged from 17 to 30 years.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said in a statement it had \u201cput in place measures to ensure that policing is subject to appropriate levels of transparency and accountability \u2013 with regular inspections of the way forces engage with communities, frequent publication of data on use of police powers and strengthening the police complaints system.</p> <p>\u201cIf an officer does commit a serious breach of the standards expected of them, disciplinary proceedings and, if appropriate, criminal proceedings should follow.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2020. The organisation Stand Up To Racism has called for a day of action on Wednesday 3 June, but is not involved in the Hyde Park demonstration as an earlier version had said.</p>",

When it was put to him that some contact tracers have said they have had nothing to do, Hancock said that was a good thing.

But the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, says<a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/may/speaker-agrees-to-recall-of-parliament/\"> it is not safe to return to the old system of voting, involving large numbers of MPs crowding into the division lobbies.</a> Instead Rees-Mogg will ask MPs tomorrow to agree to a new system of voting, reportedly one that would involve MPs having to form an enormous queue all around parliament so that they can vote in person while observing social distancing.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/thehouse/article/the-virtual-parliament-is-no-longer-necessary-we-can-do-so-much-better\">an article for the House magazine </a>Rees-Mogg explains why he thinks it is so important for MPs to return to the Commons in person. Here\u2019s an excerpt.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It comes down to the quality of communication between MPs and ministers. Politics is better done face-to-face, even if the whites of the ministerial eyes are six feet away. In the chamber frontbenchers will have to keep on their toes as interventions are once again made possible. This exceptional aspect of British democracy, curtailed under the hybrid halfway house, can once again flourish.</p> <p>Out of the chamber, too, MPs will be able to come together - at the right social distance - to represent shared problems faced by those in multiple constituencies. This is what Edmund Burke meant when he wrote that parliament should be a \u201cdeliberative assembly of one nation\u201d rather than a \u201ccongress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests\u201d. Cross-party work is often under-reported but is an important part of our system. With MPs present in Westminster, rather than scattered hither and thither, voters\u2019 interests will be better represented.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Labour MP <strong>Dame Margaret Hodge</strong>, who is in the \u201cvulnerable\u201d category, says the Rees-Mogg proposal will disenfranchise MPs like her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/margarethodge/status/1267459620399984641\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow the Govt wants 650 MPs to stand in a giant queue to vote on how the Commons makes decisions from now on.

He explains: <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As state primary schools in England open today, so too do their independent counterparts, often known as prep schools. Christopher King, the chief executive of the <strong>I</strong><strong>ndependent Association of Prep Schools</strong>, says almost all of the 550 prep schools in England belonging to IAPS have opened to year 6 pupils this morning. Those with nurseries or \u201cpre-prep\u201d are also opening to reception and year 1 age groups, with what King calls a mixture of enthusiasm and apprehension.</p> <p>\u2018The vast majority of prep schools in England are open today, apart from a few that are opening tomorrow. They are enthusiastic about reopening, but for staff and parents there is a degree of apprehension particularly because of the younger year groups and the difficulty in social distancing,\u2019 King said.</p> <p>Like state schools, prep schools remained open for the children of key workers and to provide remote learning for the rest of their pupils. Initial reports of unhappy parents saw many private schools cut their fees by 10%-20% for this term.</p> <p>The situation is different in secondary schools, where neither state nor independent senior schools are reopening for the rest of the school year in England, other than for brief visits by year 10 and year 12 pupils from 15 June. In any case, boarding schools such as Eton would face additional complications in reopening because of the coronavirus regulations around residential education.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> Although in the past it was true that Conservative MPs mostly sent their children to private schools, that is probably not the case now.

These are people who, for the last 10 weeks, have been told to stay in their homes 24/7, without any break for exercise or fresh air. </p> <p>This marks a remarkable U-turn from ministers. Previous guidance advised that people with serious underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or low immunity, would need to shield until the <a href=\"https://shropshireccg.nhs.uk/health-advice/coronavirus-advice/shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-groups/\">end of June</a>.

The latest update \u2013 announced via tweets at 10pm on a Saturday night and trailed in the press \u2013 was like moving the goalposts on the quiet. Rather than hearing it first from a government briefing or from their doctor, shielders had to find out about the change on social media. </p> <p>When I spoke to people affected, the reaction was one of confusion, anxiety, and anger.

But at a press conference last week <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-press-conference-statement-on-the-five-tests-28-may-2020\">Boris Johnson claimed that all five tests were being achieved.</a></p> <p>The five tests were originally set out by Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-uk-live-news-covid-19-lockdown-extension?page=with:block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645#block-5e988f548f08cf571cdb2645\">at a press conference in April</a> (when Johnson was ill). Here they are, with the rival assessments for each test from Johnson in his speech last week and from the ADPH yesterday <a href=\"https://www.adph.org.uk/2020/05/adph-presidential-blog-a-time-for-steady-leadership-careful-preparation-and-measured-steps/\">in its statement.</a></p> <p>The PM says all five tests have been passed. The ADPH accepts that the first test has been met, but on the other four it says it is too soon to be sure.</p> <p><strong><em>1 - NHS\u2019s ability to cope must be protected</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At the start of the outbreak, there was significant concern that the NHS would not be able to cope. That turned out not to be the case, thanks to the heroic efforts of everyone who works in the NHS. And the heroic efforts of the British people to contain this virus. </p> <p>The data show that on 26 May, 475 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus - down from a peak of 3,121 on a single day, on 2 April.</p> <p>On 27 May, 11% of mechanical ventilator beds in the UK were occupied by patients with coronavirus, down from a peak of 41% on 10 April.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Firstly, the pressure on the NHS \u2013 and those that tirelessly and expertly work within it \u2013 has been significant but it has been able to cope with those who unfortunately need hospital treatment for the effects of Covid-19. The number of people in hospitals with Covid-19 is falling, and beds are available for those that require them.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>2 - Sustained and consistent fall in daily death rates</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As measured by a seven-day rolling average, the UK daily death rate now stands at 256, down from a peak of 943 on 14 April.</p> <p>While every death is one too many, it is now the case that there has been a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate, and so the second test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Secondly, there must be a sustained and consistent fall in the daily death rate. While the first peak in deaths has passed, the downward trend is slow \u2013 particularly in care settings. Deaths are a measure of what happened roughly two weeks before \u2013 the effect of easing measures now will only become evident in two weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>3 - Rate of infection decreasing to manageable levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And in the last seven days, an average of 2,312 new cases were confirmed with a positive test, that\u2019s down from a peak of 5,066 in the first week of May.</p> <p>Based on the various data available, the government is satisfied that the third test is being met.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The critical debate is about the third test \u2013 ensuring the rate of transmission of the infection continues decreasing to manageable levels (taken to mean R being well below 1). The rapid and multiple ways in which measures are being eased is likely to make it difficult to judge the cumulative impact on R. As we saw in March, R can go above 1 in a very short space of time \u2013 and once it does it can take many months to bring it back down. The room for manoeuvre is tight.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>4 - Testing capacity and PPE supply at adequate levels</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yesterday we carried out 119,587 tests, compared to around 12,000 at the start of April. Testing capacity has now increased to 161,214 a day.</p> <p>We have now signed over 100 new deals with PPE suppliers around the world. Here in the UK, thanks to the efforts of Lord Deighton and his team and the brilliance of domestic manufacturers we have signed contracts for over two billion items of PPE, including face masks, visors, gowns and aprons.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fourth aspect, ensuring supply of tests and PPE is able meet future demand, remains an enormous challenge. PPE manufacturing and supply chains are stronger, but shortages are still being reported and it is not clear that supply can meet new demand as different parts of society, public services and the economy open. While testing capacity has undoubtedly increased, we are not yet confident that the current testing regime is sufficiently effective in getting the priority tests done and the results to where they are needed to enable swift action.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>5 - No risk of a second peak that would overwhelm NHS</em></strong></p> <p>What PM says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This package has been carefully designed so that we can ease the burdens of lockdown while expecting to keep that R below one. I cannot and will not throw away all the gains we have made together, and so the changes we are making are limited and cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>What ADPH says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Finally, the fifth test. A second peak cannot be ruled out \u2013 whether it will overwhelm the NHS is an important question to ask. But perhaps the even bigger one is, do we really want the same number of deaths again? The scale to date represents an unimaginable tragedy and we must do everything possible to limit further loss of life.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T09:08:58.006Z\">at 10.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b8aa8f08f5e3730122cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:25:11.227Z\">9.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning.

Here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Directors of Public Health are increasingly concerned that the government is misjudging this balancing act and lifting too many restrictions, too quickly. </p> <p>This is a new disease; evidence is still emerging and there is much uncertainty. However, based on what is currently known, several leading scientists and public health experts have spoken out about a string of recent national policy announcements affecting England which project a degree of confidence that many \u2013 including ADPH members \u2013 do not think is supported by the science.</p> <p>Over the weekend we have seen signs that the public is no longer keeping as strictly to social distancing as it was \u2013 along with this, we are concerned that the resolve on personal hygiene measures, and the need to immediately self-isolate, if symptomatic, is waning. A relentless effort to regain and rebuild public confidence and trust following recent events is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>De Gruchy expanded on this in an interview on the Today programme this morning. She said local directors of public health could only be effective if other parts of the anti-coronavirus programme were working too. She went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we need testing, the national testing programme, to be absolutely robust and ready, and we need the NHS test and trace to be robust and ready. And of course the other issue ... is about PPE and the supply of PPE. So all of those organisational challenges that we are all working really hard getting in place - we\u2019re not feeling, just yet, that we are really confident enough to meet any potential challenge if the government goes too quickly on easing lockdown measures.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:37:02.406Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4b1498f084df971c8d53a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:44:28.682Z\">8.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More than 200 travel and hospitality businesses have joined a campaign urging the government to overturn its planned 14-day quarantine for arrivals into the UK, PA Media reports.</p> <p>The group of major hotels, travel companies and restaurateurs claim the policy is \u201cunworkable\u201d and are calling for air bridges to be created which enable people to travel - without being quarantined - between countries where the risk of being infected by coronavirus is deemed to be low.</p> <p>George Morgan-Grenville, the chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, who is leading the campaign, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is not just a group of company bosses complaining, but employees from bottom to top calling for the quarantine plans to be quashed.</p> <p>The extent of their pain is deeply worrying for our economy and our country.</p> </blockquote> <p>More than 200 businesses have signed the letter to the home secretory, Priti Patel. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:51:00.035Z\">at 8.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4aade8f08f5e37301227a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T07:21:09.052Z\">8.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Today in Focus podcast is exploring the coronavirus crisis in Britain\u2019s prisons.</p> <p>When Britain went into lockdown in March, most people were confined to their homes with little more than a short daily walk allowed.

It\u2019s difficult for the BHA to consult with the stalls handlers, because they don\u2019t have a specific representative body. But the BHA assures me it met and engaged with employers of the handlers (Racetech and ARC), as well as with its own starters in formulating the protocols, which include disinfecting of equipment. There was a test at Lingfield on Friday with six handlers, which apparently went well and no concerns were raised, I\u2019m told.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/stalls-handlers-issue-safety-warning-over-horse-racing-return-to-action\">Talking Horses: stalls handlers have safety fears plus Hong Kong tips</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed503cc8f08f5e373012628\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T13:34:35.817Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A supportive tweet from the travelling head lad to Newmarket trainer Hugo Palmer</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/pjmcculloch01/status/1267409261111513089\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Credit where credit is due <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NewcastleRaces?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NewcastleRaces</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JRFArmstrong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JRFArmstrong</a> free hampers for racing staff great gesture much appreciated <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NARSnewsinfo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NARSnewsinfo</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RacingPost?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RacingPost</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidmilnesHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@davidmilnesHQ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NTFnews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NTFnews</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BHAPressOffice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BHAPressOffice</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XWr6SWT6dB\">pic.twitter.com/XWr6SWT6dB</a></p>\u2014 peter mcculloch (@pjmcculloch01) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pjmcculloch01/status/1267409261111513089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed502de8f084df971c8d8cb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T13:31:12.376Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Mick Appleby has got on the scoresheet thanks to Edraak, after a disappointment in the first race with Stone Mason.

But it\u2019s tens of millions of pounds of lost attendance income across the industry. Say your ticket is \u00a330 and you have 30,000 tickets, it starts to get extremely expensive and it will take racecourses some time to recover, at least until the backend of next year. <br><br>\u201cI think there will be a reshaping of the industry, but I\u2019m not quite sure exactly how that\u2019s going to play out. In our case, at least until September we\u2019re not racing at Brighton and Worcester and it could be that we narrow even further the tracks that will race this year. When you get to that position, you do have to wonder whether an individual racetrack, where you\u2019ve got declining retail media rights [from betting shops], is able to have a future. <br><br>\u201cI sincerely hope that there won\u2019t be any casualties but I do fear for some racecourses.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4fa728f08f5e3730125b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:55:48.461Z\">1.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cVery gluey, very testing,\u201d is the verdict from jockey Ben Robinson, who won the second race on Little Jo.

Speak Of The Devil, meanwhile, walked out of the stalls and was free at the back of a slowly run race before quickening through traffic to nick second. It looked more like an exercise gallop than a race for her and hopefully she can improve for it. Drying ground might not be in her favour, however, as she\u2019s a half-sister to that noted mudlover Morando. I\u2019ve seen the going described as soft but I expect it\u2019ll have dried out to good by the time of the Classics. <strong>Ellerslie Lace</strong> doesn\u2019t look good enough to win but she might nick a place at 50-1. She was only three lengths behind Tropbeau last time and drying ground looks a plus for her. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4f7738f08f5e37301257c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:43:36.967Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The betting market got a bit closer to sorting that race out, Little Jo being a previous winner at this course and therefore easier to spot than our first winner.

Ordinarily, they\u2019d be at Longchamp but the Parisian tracks have been closed for the time being because Covid-19 remains too much of a problem in the area, so French racing is focused on the Normandy coast. <br> It may make a difference because Deauville\u2019s mile is straight, whereas the trials have been run on turning tracks and often at a false pace. Today\u2019s Poule d\u2019Essai Des Poulains ought to be run at a stronger clip, because of the status of the race and also because there are no fewer than three runners who made all the running last time. Each of them was gifted a soft lead, which surely won\u2019t happen today; will they fight for the lead? I think the circumstances give a chance to <strong>Kenway (2.50pm BST)</strong>, a 25-1 shot. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be exposed after nine runs and he was well held by some of these at Longchamp in October but that came at the end of a busy year for him and the closing surge he produced to win a Group Three the previous month was deeply impressive. <br> He got a lot closer to the likes of Victor Ludorum three weeks ago, when he again finished well after being held up out the back in a steadily run race. He comes from the yard of Frederic Rossi, who isn\u2019t well known in Britain but currently tops the trainers table in France. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with the move to a straight track and I think the rhythm of the race will help him,\u201d Rossi has told today\u2019s Post. At 33-1 or bigger, I\u2019d also be interested in <strong>Reshabar</strong>, who has achieved least of today\u2019s field in pure form terms but looks very progressive and unexposed. He\u2019s trained in Germany by Markus Munch, who appears to be a version of Clive Brittain in that he\u2019s happy to turn up in big races with outsiders. Munch\u2019s 50-1 shot Spectre was fourth of 16 in the Queen Anne three years ago. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4f2408f084df971c8d7fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T12:24:17.636Z\">1.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There\u2019s some runners from Newmarket in the next race and one thing to consider is that they will have had to travel that 245-mile trip this morning.

Mark Johnston was telling me on Twitter recently that he likes his horses to be at the track at least four hours before they run.

But what is the best tactic to pick a route through the bear-traps as horses, jockeys and trainers try to pick up the threads of the Flat season after nearly three months off? <br><br>Punters have latched on to the tried-and-tested \u201cfirst run for Mick Appleby\u201d system in the opener, which has shown an 18% profit on turnover since the start of 2017 with 30 winners. These include the likes of Merryweather, who won her first start for Appleby in December at 22-1 just a few weeks after leaving Ralph Beckett\u2019s yard as a twice-raced maiden, and has since added two more wins and run well in a Listed race at Deauville, with other winners on debut for the yard at 16-1, 14-1 and 10-1 twice. <br><br>Appleby suggests in this morning\u2019s Racing Post that <strong>Stone Mason</strong> (1.00), a recruit from Roger Charlton\u2019s stable, might need the run, so while many punters are happy to take 6-4 about the four-year-old, there are probably more appealing bets elsewhere and <strong>Ice Pyramid</strong> (5.05) could be the pick of the card. <br><br>Philip Kirby\u2019s gelding put up a career-best to win over track-and-trip in February, travelling smoothly and winning with something to spare in a very good time. He is up another 7lb in the weights but is certainly up to bridging the gap if he is anywhere close to his best and a current price of 7-2 looks generous. <br><br><strong>Little Red Socks </strong>(2.10) knew her job when making a winning debut for Karl Burke in March and has decent prospects of following up at around 7-2, while a step back up to six furlongs could be just what <strong>Heath Charnock </strong>(3.20) needs a couple of races later. <br><br>Simon and Ed Crisford, British racing\u2019s first officially licensed training partnership, will be keen to hit the ground running with <strong>Rock Of Diamonds </strong>(3.55), while Newcastle specialist <strong>Be Proud </strong>(4.30), a dual winner over course-and-distance, is the solid option at around 100-30 in the five-furlong handicap. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4e80a8f087122eca534c1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T11:36:31.733Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Greg Wood has ploughed through the form to bring you tips for today\u2019s resumption card at Newcastle.

There would still have to be at least one steward at the track to make decisions on things like whether it\u2019s safe to race if something goes wrong, so, on a day like this, with just one card, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference. But we have two cards or more per day from tomorrow and a central panel could have ruled over all of it. Evidently, the BHA have decided that these circumstances bring enough challenges without trialling remote stewards. But racing should get around to trying it some day.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed4e4238f084df971c8d754\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T11:21:30.967Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just for clarity, I\u2019m not at Newcastle, much though I\u2019d like to be.

  "<p>Care home operators have warned that easing Covid-19 shielding restrictions for 2.2 million vulnerable people risks a second wave of infections, as it emerged that government scientific advisers who previously warned against such a move were not asked to reconsider the matter.</p> \n<p>New <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/experts-decry-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown-for-englands-shielders\">guidance </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/experts-decry-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown-for-englands-shielders\">allows the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/experts-decry-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown-for-englands-shielders\">\u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d to go outside</a> and, if they live alone, meet one friend from Monday. They include many in long-term care facilities for elderly people, as well as those with chronic illnesses living at home.</p> \n<p>Strict isolation rules were expected to stay in place for at least another two weeks. The government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888761/S0406_SAGE22_200401_SPI-M_consensus_view_on_social_distancing_options_for_SAGE.pdf\">warned in April</a> that \u201clifting the policy of shielding the vulnerable would \u2026 lead to a sharp increase in hospitalisation, ICU admissions, and the death rates within this age group\u201d.</p> \n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19\">guidelines say</a> shielded people \u201ccan now leave their home if they wish, as long as they are able to maintain strict social distancing. If you choose to spend time outdoors, this can be with members of your own household. If you live alone, you can spend time outdoors with one person from another household.\u201d</p> \n<p>The sudden relaxation of the rules this weekend appeared to surprise many health officials. NHS England\u2019s primary care medical director, Nikki Kanani, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NikkiKF/status/1267089120263798784\">indicated on Twitter</a> that she was not told in advance.</p> \n<p>Local directors of public health also said they were not forewarned, with one telling the Guardian they were \u201cmystified\u201d by the change, adding: \u201cThe lack of information sharing is appalling.\u201d Another said: \u201cWe were led to believe during the week any change would be at the end of June, once we were more reassured about the infection rate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nadra Ahmed, executive chairman of the National Care Association, said the loosened restrictions could bring the virus back into care homes still struggling to contain the first wave of infection, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">which has caused </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">about 15,000 deaths</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cHow do we guarantee that the person coming to visit is Covid-free?\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cWe can\u2019t. The only way we could deal with it is by isolating the resident when they come back in and testing them, but with tests still not available to many care homes, how would we be able to do that? This is inviting a virus back into the service that a lot of care homes have worked very hard to eradicate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked on Monday whether the loosening of the rules for the shielding group had been discussed at Sage, Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman said there had been engagement with GPs, the British Medical Association and patient groups, but that the new guidance was approved by the deputy chief medical officers and Public Health England. It is understood that Sage experts were not asked to examine the issue again or submit any new evidence before the surprise change in guidance.</p> \n<p>Many people vulnerable to Covid-19 have complained of the mental strain and loneliness of shielding, which has prevented them from going out since&nbsp;lockdown measures were imposed 10 weeks ago.</p> \n<p>Charities representing some shielded groups last Friday warned the government: \u201cAs restrictions are eased for the rest of the country, the burden on those who are being asked to stay inside or away from people will become harder to bear.\u201d</p> \n<p>Macmillan Cancer Support, the British Lung Foundation and Asthma UK, the MS Society, Kidney Care UK and the Cystic Fibrosis Trust were among those who said they were \u201cdeeply concerned about the impact on the mental health of those who are shielding\u201d. Steven McIntosh, policy director at Macmillan, said the new guidance was \u201ca step forward for \u2026 a group who have felt left behind and forgotten as lockdown eases\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The Relatives and Residents Association, which represents families in social care, had also called for a rethink of the shielding measures. \u201cWe know some people are getting isolated and lonely and particularly for people with dementia it can be hard to understand why that has happened,\u201d said Helen Wildbore, the director of the charity. \u201cWe have heard about people who have stopped eating and drinking and have lost speech.\u201d</p> \n<p>But with many care homes focused on stopping a second wave of infection and currently restricting residents\u2019 movements by agreement, Prof Martin Green, the executive director of Care England, said the new guidance \u201cwill create a tension, with people saying, \u2018We have seen the announcement, so why can\u2019t I take my relative out?\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said his members had not been consulted and that the sudden announcement was \u201ca typical example of making an announcement and publishing guidance later\u201d. \u201cThey should publish the scientific advice on why this was done and they need to publish specific guidance for care homes.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Thursday, the prime minister gave no inkling of the lifting of restrictions, telling the Downing Street press conference: \u201cI am afraid that those who have been asked to shield themselves should continue to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>The housing and communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the government was trying to find \u201cthe right balance between continuing to protect those at the greatest clinical risk, whilst easing restrictions on their daily lives to make the difficult situation more bearable \u2013 particularly enabling the contact with loved ones they and we all seek\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pressed on the timing of the announcement and the lack of advance notice for GPs, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, insisted that it had been \u201cvery well received by those who are shielded\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been rushed through, far from it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked for some time to make sure any changes we make \u2013 small, cautious changes \u2013 can benefit people in a safe way. Being able to make changes like this is important for people. It\u2019s quite hard to imagine for even those of us practising self-isolation to understand the impact of shielding.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnce we\u2019d made the decision in collaboration with all of the government bodies, we communicated the decision, and that was the right time to be able to change that advice.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said on Monday:&nbsp;\u201cWe have engaged extensively with partners and the healthcare system throughout this process and will continue to do, particularly in the next two weeks, when more substantive measures are considered. The announcement yesterday signalled this period of engagement.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want to make life easier for the most vulnerable and, as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to fall, the evidence shows those shielding can choose to spend time safely outside if they wish, as long as they follow social distancing guidelines.\u201d </p>",

  "<p>Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has shown signs of recovering from the worst damage inflicted during the coronavirus outbreak, after a survey showed that factory output had declined at a slower pace in May than a month earlier.</p> <p>The&nbsp;monthly snapshot&nbsp;from <a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/a586ad660bc74f9ea79ee2c9fb824742?s=1\">IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply</a>, which is closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signals about the economy, indicated that the downturn in the manufacturing sector eased last month as lockdown measures were gradually lifted.</p> <p>The manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) \u2013 compiled from surveys of business activity \u2013 rose to 40.7 in May from 32.6 a month earlier, when harsh restrictions brought Britain\u2019s economy to an effective standstill.</p> <p>However, the index remained below the 50 mark that separates economic growth from contraction, and still represented one of the worst months on record for factory output.</p> <p>According to the latest figures, manufacturers continued to feel the impact from the coronavirus pandemic as the economy struggled to build momentum to escape the deepest recession in living memory.</p> <p>Pockets of growth were generally linked to healthcare-related or personal protective equipment products as factories increased production to respond to the global health emergency.</p> <p>Despite the continued stress facing the industry, IHS Markit said the worst of the downturn had probably passed, as lockdown measures were gradually being lifted and factories were starting to reopen for business.</p> <p>Stock markets around the world rose on Monday amid promising indicators of economic activity from other major nations, including figures revealing an unexpected return to growth for <a href=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-06-01/china-manufacturing-rebounds-as-economy-shakes-off-coronavirus-caixin-pmi-shows-101560867.html\">Chinese factory production</a> in May after three months of contraction.</p> <p>PMI readings for the US and eurozone also rose from record low levels recorded in March and April, indicating that the moment of maximum damage for the world economy might now have passed.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 closed up 1.5% on Monday at 6,166. Markets across Europe also recorded fresh gains, while Wall Street was higher in early afternoon trading.</p> <p>Despite the positive signals, economists and industry groups warned that the recovery could take longer than first expected and that the risk of lasting damage was rising. The threat of a second wave of Covid-19 infections, renewed lockdown measures or government emergency financial support being removed too soon could also rapidly derail the rebound.</p> <p>Rob Dobson, a director of IHS Markit, said: \u201cChanges to working practices, uncertainty about how long the Covid-19 restrictions may be in place for, weak demand and Brexit worries all suggest the UK is set for a drawn-out economic recovery.</p> <p>\u201cThis will make the \u2018new normal\u2019 one of the toughest recovery environments many manufacturers will ever have to face.\u201d</p>",

You could see the excitement in their faces coming down the path. They were excited to have somebody to chat to and engage with,\u201d said Proffitt.</p> <p>At Watlington primary school in Oxfordshire, headteacher&nbsp;Yvonne Hammerton-Jackson said the return of more pupils had marked a \u201csuccessful, happy and safe day\u201d but that only half of students from reception, year one and year six were invited back on site as there is not&nbsp;space for them all to be distanced.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re running a rota, which is not what we\u2019re supposed to be doing, but it\u2019s the only way I can do it,\u201d she said, of the system where classes have been split into two, with half coming in for two days a week and the other half for two other days.</p> <p>Of those eligible&nbsp;to return, about half did on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve given parents the option to revisit their decision in a fortnight\u2019s time if they feel more confident, and I\u2019m sure they will, so we\u2019re expecting the numbers to grow,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Children were given their own carpet tiles to sit on and many classes were taught outside. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so pleased to see each other again,\u201d&nbsp;Hammerton-Jackson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been teaching them how to stay apart but how to be friends.

It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The increasing militarization of US society is inseparable from its imperial policies (211 deployments of US armed forces in 67 countries since 1945). The militaristic response to the killing of Floyd tells a story&nbsp;of oversized police presence, unprovoked assaults and excessive force. Ironically, the misleading debate over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protesters-condemn-opportunistic-looting-violence\">rioters v protesters</a> and outside agitators v legitimate local citizens turns attention away from&nbsp;how heavy law enforcement presence fuels disrespect for the police. The stark contrast of the police response to rightwing provocateurs who show up inside and outside state capitols with guns and loaded ammunition looms large.</p> <p>I recall my own experience of protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, against hundreds of masked, armed Nazis with live ammunition in which the police stepped back and remained still and silent as we were mercilessly attacked. Without the intervention and protection of antifa, some of us would have died. Sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other\">Heather Heyer</a> did die. I believe the attack on any innocent person is wrong, but the focus on the protesters\u2019 assaults on persons or property takes our attention away from the police killing of hundreds of black, poor and working-class people.</p> <p>It also obscures the role of the repressive apparatus in preserving an order so unjust and cruel. The rule of big money, class and gender hierarchies and global militarism must be highlighted in our profound concern with anti-black police murder and brutality.</p> <p>The four catastrophes Martin Luther King Jr warned us about \u2013&nbsp;militarism (in Asia, Africa and the Middle East), poverty (at record levels), materialism (with narcissistic addictions to money, fame and spectacle) and racism (against black and indigenous people, Muslims, Jews and non-white immigrants) \u2013&nbsp;have laid bare the organised hatred, greed and corruption in the country. The killing machine of the US military here and abroad has lost its authority. The profit-driven capitalist economy has lost its glow. And the glitz of the market-driven culture (including media and education) are more and more hollow.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fundamental question at this moment is: can this failed social experiment be reformed? The political duopoly of an escalating neofascist Donald Trump-led Republican party and a fatigued Joe Biden-led neoliberal Democratic party \u2013&nbsp;in no way equivalent, yet both beholden to Wall Street and the Pentagon \u2013&nbsp;are symptoms of a decadent leadership class. The weakness of the labor movement and the present difficulty of the radical left to unite around a nonviolent revolutionary project of democratic sharing and redistribution of power, wealth and respect are signs of a society unable to regenerate the best of its past and present.&nbsp;Any society that refuses to eliminate or attenuate dilapidated housing, decrepit school systems, mass incarceration, massive unemployment and underemployment, inadequate healthcare and its violations of rights and liberties is undesirable and unsustainable.</p> <p>Yet the magnificent moral courage and spiritual sensitivity of the multiracial response to the police killing of George Floyd that now spills over into a political resistance to the legalized looting of Wall Street greed, the plundering of the planet and the degradation of women and LGBTQ+ peoples means we are still fighting regardless of the odds.&nbsp;</p> <p>If radical democracy dies in America, let it be said of us that we gave our all-and-all as the boots of American fascism tried to crush our necks.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Cornel West is an American philosopher, author, critic, actor, civil rights activist and leading member of Democratic Socialists of America</p></li> </ul>",
  "<h2>KICKING OFF</h2> \n<p>The Fiver has a dream. In it, the death of almost 400,000 people during a global pandemic leaves all survivors the gift of epiphany, after which they vow to give up public displays of vainglory. Oh, Fiver! Oh,&nbsp;<em>Fiver!&nbsp;</em>If anything, Covid-19 has increased participation in the nation\u2019s favourite sport, the self.&nbsp;The lack of physical contact has created a blizzard of new opportunities to demonstrate the essential irrelevance of every other living thing. You don\u2019t even have to wait for your turn to speak, or for your brain to boot up, like you did before lockdown. Alehouse inanity at digital speed!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/macclesfield-at-risk-of-points-deduction-and-relegation-after-new-efl-charge-player-wages\">Macclesfield at risk of points deduction and relegation after new EFL charges</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>All of which brings us onto the nation\u2019s other favourite sport. And having spent the last two months of lockdown exploring every possible permutation, the Fiver can confirm that there is no combination of words in the English language that adequately convey how prodigiously bored we are of the everyday egotism, entitlement and avarice in English football.</p> \n<p>Yesterday, the EFL announced that the Championship would provisionally restart on 20 June, with the play-off final on or around 30 July. The schedule \u2013 12 games in 41 days for those who make the final \u2013 isn\u2019t ideal, but on the Fiver\u2019s Patented Post-Covid Scale O\u2019 Inconvenience\u2122, it falls marginally below death, redundancy and having to watch another repeat of EFL Hits: Barnsley v Luton.</p> \n<p>It seems, alas, that this start date might be optimistic. QPR were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/championship-qpr-appalled-by-restart-date-of-20-june\">the first team to kick up a fuss</a>, and they say that a number of other clubs are unhappy with the idea. \u201cI have made our feelings known to the EFL and, having spoken with a number of CEOs at other Championship clubs, I am not a lone voice on this matter,\u201d chirruped the QPR chief executive Lee Hoos. \u201cWe are absolutely appalled. Incredibly there has been absolutely no consultation with individual clubs nor with the Championship doctors\u2019 working group by the divisional representatives \u2013 or anyone else in the Football League \u2013 regarding this matter. On top of that, we were only made aware of the statement 40 minutes before it was made public. Having spoken with [Sir] Les [Ferdinand, director of football] and Mark [Warburton, manager], they share my views. We are vehemently opposed to this schedule.\u201d</p> \n<p>QPR might have a point. Your super soaraway Fiver, which last broke a news story when Didier Baptiste signed for Liverpool in 1999, doesn\u2019t have a clue about the rights and wrongs of the situation. Nor do we have any idea who said what behind closed doors, because the only private conversations we hear are through the bottom of a glass.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This isn\u2019t about QPR or the EFL; it\u2019s about the fact the Fiver gave up the gaspers on Sunday morning and we\u2019re starting to feel a wee bit irascibl- sorry, it\u2019s about the relentless self-interest, which will be ramped up as the summer progresses. And it\u2019s about the fact that, in the last 28 years, English football has developed a value system that Donald Trump would regard as a great, great value system.</p> \n<p>In other news, Charlton will be without three players if the Championship resumes. That includes the top scorer Lyle Taylor, who is out of contract at the end of June, has decided he doesn\u2019t want to risk jeopardising a \u201clife-changing move\u201d by getting injured. What an absolute pragmatist! At least he\u2019s honest about it, which puts him 1-0 up on plenty of others in a sport that urgently needs a steel-jacketed dose of perspective right up its elite pathway.</p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Niall McVeigh for piping hot action from the Bundesliga!

  "<p>It\u2019s easy to see why Boris Johnson is keen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/01/uk-coronavirus-live-england-schools-reopen-lockdown-eases-covid-19-latest-updates\">reopen </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/01/uk-coronavirus-live-england-schools-reopen-lockdown-eases-covid-19-latest-updates\">England\u2019s classrooms.</a> Closing schools has put vulnerable children at higher risk, widened inequality and deepened the economic slump caused by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>pandemic.</p> <p>No question, the closure of schools is going to keep educationalists, sociologists and economists busy for years to come. There will be studies galore about the long-term impact of the lockdown on child development, social mobility, wellbeing and lifetime earnings. The findings are likely to make depressing reading, not least as there is evidence that depriving young people of education is bad news in a world where human capital matters more than ever before.</p> <p>No country wants to leave schools closed for longer than is necessary, but the incentives for the UK to reopen are perhaps higher than for most. For decades governments of both left and right have been using sticks and carrots to persuade new parents to join the workforce, which is one reason why Britain entered the current crisis with record levels of employment.</p> <p>But, as Samuel Tombs of the consultancy Pantheon economics points out, it also meant school closures had more of an impact in the UK than in other countries. By his estimate, about 8% of employees have been forced to stay at home to look after their children. Some of these 2.5 million people will now be able to go back to work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The evidence from the rest of the world looks encouraging. Schools have reopened in places such as France and Germany without any interruption in the rapid decline in Covid-19 cases and deaths. That seems consistent with the idea that children do not readily transmit the virus.</p> <p>Yet, while the infection rate in the UK has fallen markedly from its peak in April, it is still higher than it was in Germany and France when the schools were reopened. In Spain and Italy, where infection rates per head of population are similar to the UK\u2019s, teaching has not resumed. That, coupled with the fact that primary school classes are on average higher than the European average, means the prime minister should remember the advice of the Roman emperor Augustus: make haste slowly.</p> <h2>Primark isn\u2019t best suited to a post-Covid-19 world</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de42e5b3e6e85aa61b25680a771fb47cfde35a68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de42e5b3e6e85aa61b25680a771fb47cfde35a68/0_59_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A busy Primark store in 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When it reopens, Primark will have find a way of marrying its mass-market approach with the need to regulate customer numbers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are plenty of similarities between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/01/shopper-numbers-surge-36-as-lockdown-in-england-relaxed\">Ikea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/01/primark-plans-to-reopen-all-153-stores-in-england-on-15-june-covid-19\">Primark.</a> Sure, one sells furniture and the other clothes, but both operate a pile \u2019em high, sell \u2019em cheap model. They make money with a simple proposition: you can get what you want at a price you can afford.</p> <p>The pull of Ikea was obvious when it re-opened 19 of its stores for the first time since March. Big physically-distanced queues snaked around car parks as customers waited for their chance to buy a double bed or a flat-packed bookcase. Associated British Foods will be hopeful of a similar response when they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/01/primark-plans-to-reopen-all-153-stores-in-england-on-15-june-covid-19\">re-open all 153 Primark stores in England</a> in a fortnight\u2019s time.</p> <p>But there are differences between the two companies and these are likely to be highlighted in the post-Covid-19 world. One is that Ikea is all about staying in and Primark is all about going out \u2013 and there is going to be more of the former and a lot less of the latter, at least for a while.</p> <p>Ikea stores, with their existing one-way systems that channel shoppers around, are already configured for a physically-distanced consumer experience. The same cannot be said of Primark, which is going to have find a way of marrying its mass-market approach with the need to regulate the number of customers, operate sufficient changing-room capacity and find ways of getting clothes that have been tried on but remain unsold back on to the shop floor. It\u2019s not going to be easy.</p> <h2>FCA nips insurance issue in bud with test case</h2> <p>The decision by the Financial Conduct Authority to bring a test case in the high court in July to see whether companies can claim for losses made as a result of government restrictions is welcome.</p> <p>At root, the issue is simple. Companies paid insurance premiums to cover disruption from a \u201cnotifiable disease\u201d and assumed this would include the coronavirus. But many insurers refused to pay out, saying that the wording of policies excluded losses made as a result of a government-induced lockdown of the economy in response to a global crisis.</p> <p>This was the sort of dispute that could have dragged on for years, by which time many of the businesses would have gone under. The FCA action against a sample of eight insurers means it will be resolved next month. A good thing, too.</p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;This article was amended on 2 June 2020 to make clear that the reference to Boris Johnson and schools reopening applied only to England, not to Britain.</p>",

The marble goes on to enjoy an emphatic win.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSod you, Lineker, you drew me in,\u201d tweeted one follower. \u201cBut you\u2019re glad I did, aren\u2019t you?\u201d replied the TV presenter and former England footballer.&nbsp;</p> <p>Welcome to the madcap world of competitive marble racing, which you might describe as a spoof sport were it not, to its growing number of fans, so very serious.</p> <p>The sand rally was staged by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJdpnjuSWVOLgGT9fIzL0g\">Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs</a>, a YouTube channel that since 2006 has been run by a Dutch marble enthusiast, Jelle Bakker, and his older brother, Dion.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53011e679bba9aa50e9eeffe00fe2b1bb6bc6c1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53011e679bba9aa50e9eeffe00fe2b1bb6bc6c1a/0_24_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dion Bakker, Jelle Bakker and Anton Weber of Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dion and Jelle Bakker and Anton Weber of Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beginning with relatively simple \u2013 if enormous \u2013 marble runs, they progressed to competitions, and now screen&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYJdpnjuSWVOLgGT9fIzL0g/videos\">several elaborately staged events</a>&nbsp;each year. These see teams of marbles, often having progressed through qualifying rounds, compete in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN_boA0zTO0\">sand racing rallies</a>&nbsp;and motor racing-inspired contests called things like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wH6AuAZiDs\">Marbula One</a>. Later this month they will stage the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9QDz94WIPA\">Marble League</a>, a multi-sport tournament inspired by \u2013 but no longer named after \u2013 a more familiar multi-sport event, after the&nbsp;International Olympic Committee&nbsp;objected to its original name of MarbleLympics.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though marble racing\u2019s popularity among&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRuns/\">fan communities</a>&nbsp;has grown steadily in recent years, the global pandemic, as Dion notes wryly, \u201chas been pretty good to us\u201d. At the start of March, the JMR YouTube channel had fewer than 600,000 subscribers. That number is now more than 1.1 million and, he says, \u201cI think we will jump to 2 million pretty soon.\u201d</p> <p>The past month has seen the sport make its TV debut on US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/espn-ocho-spt-trnd/index.html\">network ESPN</a>&nbsp;and attract the attention of the comedian John Oliver\u2019s HBO show&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=50&amp;v=HPdRVxiAq_0&amp;feature=emb_logo\">Last Week Tonight</a>, which will financially sponsor the forthcoming Marble League in return for a few diminutive billboards placed among the event\u2019s 10,000+ marble \u201cspectators\u201d. The team will this week meet a major international TV producer who is interested in developing marble racing as a primetime TV format. After 20 years in youth work and child psychiatry, Dion quit his job three days ago, saying, \u201cI just live from YouTube now.\u201d</p> <p>It was Jelle, now 37, who first began making marble runs as a four-year-old autistic child, helped by his brother, who is two years older. Jelle still builds all the tracks and stands for the races, though it is no longer a two-man operation. The commentator, Greg Woods, is American, their designer is based in Belgium, their composer in Greece, and a 15-strong committee scrutinises all times and results. \u201cYeah, we have to check everything really well,\u201d says Dion, \u201cbecause in America people are really living for it, and they see it as a real sport.\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://store.dftba.com/collections/jelles-marble-runs\">Merchandise sales</a>&nbsp;for the competing teams, inevitably, are also booming.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b65f26b86bbfacbf264a2c5b99532f98a17d609\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b65f26b86bbfacbf264a2c5b99532f98a17d609/0_0_1920_1152/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of the sets at Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the sets at Jelle\u2019s Marble Runs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anton Weber/Jelle's Marble Runs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How does he account for its appeal? The lack of any other sport has obviously been significant, he says, also pointing to the humour of the videos, which include stop-motion battles between competing marbles in the stands and marble streakers.</p> <p>Fundamentally, Dion says, \u201cIt pulls you into another dimension. Most people who watch it forget real life. Everything that has a competitive element \u2013 the human brain is just addicted to that.\u201d He says 49% of viewers are now in the US, with the UK the fourth biggest audience after the Netherlands and Germany. \u201cPeople are really rooting for one team. It\u2019s very cool to see and to experience.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, he confesses with a laugh, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it really, because if you ask me, I would never watch it. I would never watch it on YouTube if I wasn\u2019t involved.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the nationwide protests it triggered, and Donald Trump\u2019s reaction have prompted comment and editorials around the globe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/rage-and-anguish-how-the-us-papers-have-covered-the-george-floyd-protests\">Rage and anguish: how the US papers have covered the George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the <strong>Sydney Morning Herald</strong>, columnist <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/trump-fans-flames-of-resentment-and-hatred-20200531-p54y39.html\">Tom Swizer</a> sees an all too familiar pattern.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe mayhem follows a depressing pattern in American history. The record of state failures to protect blacks and others against police brutality is all too full. Ditto the looting and arson, killings and general eruption of racial violence in many American cities when injustices occur.\u201d</p> \n<p>An editorial <strong>Le Monde</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/05/30/etats-unis-aux-sources-de-l-embrasement_6041274_3232.html\">paints a similar picture</a> of structural racism and police brutality by police and others against black Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cGeorge Floyd and Eric Garner are not isolated victims. The list is too long to give here of these black American men of all ages, who are too often victims of encounters with the police that turn out badly; of the trigger-happy in a country where firearms are routinely carried as an accessory, or just plain racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo many mothers in the African American community must teach their sons from early adolescence how to behave on the street so as not to arouse suspicion and not to be in turn the target of blunders or mistakes. Too many black joggers in big cities know that covering their heads with the hood of their sweatshirts or ignoring, because they have headphones on their ears, an audible warning to stop running exposes their lives to danger.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>El Peri</strong><strong>\u00f3dico</strong> in Barcelona also points to a <a href=\"https://www.elperiodico.com/es/opinion/20200530/editorial-trump-calienta-la-calle-7981349\">history of endemic racism in the US</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth is that what happened in Minneapolis, recorded on video and viewed worldwide through social networks, is just the&nbsp;latest proof that the racism epidemic is far from being controlled, and<strong> </strong>that&nbsp;the two Barack Obama administrations did nothing to cauterize any wounds.<strong> </strong>On the contrary, they&nbsp;fueled the desire for revenge&nbsp;in many communities, with a deeply rooted racist culture, which saw its time come in November 2016 with the victory of a far-right Republican candidate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many commentators are doubtful that Trump has the skills or even political capital to emerge as a healer. In an analysis, Edward Keenan, Washington bureau chief of the <strong>Toronto Star</strong>,<strong> </strong>is pessimistic that even if the president did make a speech, as some of his allies have been urging, there is <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2020/05/31/no-justice-no-peace-already-in-crisis-america-lurches-toward-chaos.html\">nothing he could say to defuse the situation</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if Trump were inclined to try to heal the nation with some kind of address, as some have called for him to do, it is hard to imagine anything he could say that would de-escalate the situation rather than be read as a provocation by the protesters.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no obvious end point to the unfolding crisis. After months of the coronavirus and days of civil unrest, Americans are bracing themselves for more chaos in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The Times</strong> of London, in its <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-times-view-on-the-george-floyd-protests-uneasy-america-g7s8vszgc\">leader</a> on Monday, draws a similar conclusion pointing to Trump\u2019s incendiary style:</p> \n<p>\u201c2020 comes with its own complications, and one of them is in the White House. On Friday, after first having called Floyd\u2019s death \u2018shocking\u2019, President Trump took to Twitter to threaten a military response against \u2018thugs\u2019 in Minneapolis and quipped: \u2018When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u2019 In a remarkable first, the social media network flagged the tweet as \u2018glorifying violence\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter demonstrations spread to the White House, the president threatened any protester breaching barriers with \u2018the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen\u2019 and appeared to be calling for his own supporters to rally to meet them. Politically, identifying enemies puts Mr Trump into his comfort zone. Rather than pouring oil on troubled waters, he has opted for petrol.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/mr-president-dont-go-hide-china-goads-us-over-george-floyd-protests\">'Mr President, don't go hide': China goads US over George Floyd protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all commentators, however, have come to the issue entirely lacking an agenda, not least in China, which has been locked in a fractious war of words with Washington over coronavirus and other issues.</p> \n<p><strong>The Global Times</strong> \u2013 under the headline \u201cGeorge Floyd murder exposes rotten racism in the US\u201d \u2013 is <a href=\"https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1190140.shtml\">predictably scathing</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a year of elections that are particularly important for Trump, votes from the black community do not matter that much. After all, Trump won just 8% of African American voters four years ago. Black voters are always the base of the Democratic party. So as protests escalate across the country, Trump played the same old political games by shaming Minneapolis\u2019 Democrat mayor and retweeting an account urging Minnesotans to vote Democrats out of office. As the pandemic gets severe, the economic card doesn\u2019t work any more for Trump. Passing the buck is his trump card.\u201d</p> \n<p>South Africa\u2019s <strong>Mail and Guardian</strong> meanwhile has <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/africa/2020-06-01-soon-hell-be-seen-as-threatening-not-cute-what-its-like-to-raise-my-black-son-in-america/\">Ifrah Udgoon</a>, a US Somali immigrant, writing about her fears for her black son.</p> \n<p>\u201cBlack mothers have much to fear when it comes to their children. American soil is saturated with the blood of black people: slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration and the war on drugs, and police brutality have ensured that black people know pain and loss intimately \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t see just a man in a single moment when we look at George Floyd. We see America\u2019s entire racial history culminating into that one moment.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>After more than two months of shutdown, schools are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/01/schools-expect-half-of-pupils-will-stay-home-as-year-groups-return\">starting to reopen their gates</a> to children without key-worker parents. However, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/16/parents-told-give-children-packed-lunches-schools-reopen/\">some schools have not yet reopened their kitchens</a>. If you have made the choice to return your kids to school, it means it could be time to start thinking about lunchboxes. Perhaps you\u2019re just a little rusty. Perhaps your children have always had school dinners and this will be their first taste of packed lunches. Either way, here\u2019s a quick guide to throwing together a cheap and healthy lunchbox.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <p>First, the basics. According to the dietitian Ursula Arens, the basic formula for a lunchbox is \u201chydration, plus wholemeal starch, plus protein, plus fruit\u201d. For hydration, water is best. Fruit can just as easily be vegetable sticks. For the rest, a sandwich is the classic main lunchbox component. </p> <p>For younger children \u2013 at nursery or key stage 1 \u2013 bitter experience has taught me that the double-handed balancing act of a traditional sandwich is sometimes too much. If that is the case, a pack of wraps will be your new best friend. Spread one with hummus, sprinkle it with shredded chicken, grated carrot, grated cheese and some salad leaves, roll it up tightly and chop it into inch-long pieces and you have something even tiny hands can manage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9effc9942bcafacb59aac66c8c0f7c6e6716edb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9effc9942bcafacb59aac66c8c0f7c6e6716edb9/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wrap it up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>The baby-and-child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed points out that, great as sandwiches are, serving up the same thing day after day can quickly put children off. She advises \u201cthinking outside the lunchbox\u201d. Carbs don\u2019t mean only bread; you can just as easily sub in an alternative. Her suggestions include crackers with a hummus dip and a mini cheese, or roasted veg with kidney beans, couscous and grated cheese.&nbsp;</p> <p>She also advises trying a frittata. These are great because kids can eat them cold with their fingers, plus you can hide no end of vegetables inside. Most importantly, the kids will eat only a slice of it, which means you get three-quarters of a frittata for your lunch. To make her <a href=\"https://www.srnutrition.co.uk/2019/11/baby-frittata-recipe\">baby frittata</a>, slice and fry five mushrooms, wilt two large handfuls of spinach, then put them in a blender with an egg and 2 tbsp of flour. Then fry the mixture like an omelette. They freeze well, too.</p> <h2>Wednesday&nbsp;</h2> <p>If you have any clear plastic jars to hand,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://watercress.co.uk/\">watercress.co.uk</a>&nbsp;(of all places) has a great <a href=\"https://www.watercress.co.uk/blog/2019/8/4/kids-layered-lunch-pots?rq=jar\">recipe for layered tuna pasta lunch pots</a>. Layer 75g of cooked macaroni, some tuna mayonnaise, half a small tin of sweetcorn and slices of red and orange pepper into a jar, top with 25g of watercress and seal the container. These keep for 24 hours in the fridge if you need to make them in advance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd5b0d724b7cfe4bf52c70c65dbd2ccaad4a194b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd5b0d724b7cfe4bf52c70c65dbd2ccaad4a194b/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frittata.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frittata.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: karma_pema/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>Lunchboxes are also a smart way to use up any leftovers. The food-waste writer Ann Storr\u2019s <a href=\"https://storrcupboard.com/\">Storr Cupboard</a> website has a useful recipe for <a href=\"https://storrcupboard.com/leftover-green-beans-pasta-pesto/\">leftover green beans with pasta and pesto</a> (she also makes the pesto from <a href=\"https://storrcupboard.com/leftover-salad-pack-pesto/\">salad bag leftovers</a>).</p> <p>For this recipe, boil 200g of salad potatoes for between 20-30 minutes, depending on the size. When they are done, remove them from the water (keeping the water) and mix in a bowl with a tablespoon or two of pesto. Then, cook 200g of short pasta, such as penne or fusilli, in the potato water, before adding it to the bowl with the potatoes. Chop the green beans into pasta-sized lengths, cook them in the same water for four minutes and add them to the bowl, too. If it needs more pesto, go crazy.</p> <h2>Friday&nbsp;</h2> <p>If your children are starting to chafe at all the fresh fruit you are giving them, the <a href=\"http://greatbritishapples.co.uk/spiced-braeburn-apple-chips/\">Great British Apples</a> website has a nice method for turning apples into lightly spiced chips. Thinly slice 400g of braeburn apples into 1-2mm rounds, sprinkle over 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground cardamom seeds, \u00bd tsp ginger powder and a pinch of salt, then place on to greased baking trays and cook for 45 minutes at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas mark 5. The resulting chips last a while if you keep them in an airtight jar.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20cc482659ef8a7cb8b29a702386124d4af77714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20cc482659ef8a7cb8b29a702386124d4af77714/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple chips.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple chips.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: senata/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An important final note: returning to school after such a long absence, especially into an environment that is so different to what they had previously experienced, might freak your children out a little. If that is the case, ambushing them with a nutritionally complete, show-off lunchbox item for the first time might be a step too far.

But experts say another metric is becoming increasingly important: K.</p> \n<h2><strong>What is K?</strong></h2> \n<p>K sheds light on the variation behind R. \u201cSome [infectious] people might generate a lot of secondary cases because of the event they attend, for example, and other people may not generate many secondary cases at all,\u201d said Dr Adam Kucharski, an expert in the dynamics of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cK is the statistical value that tells us how much variation there is in that distribution.\u201d</p> \n<p>But unlike R, K numbers are not intuitive. \u201cThe general rule is that the smaller the K value is, the more transmission comes from a smaller number of infectious people,\u201d said Kucharski. </p> \n<p>\u201cOnce K is above about five or 10 it tells you most people are generating pretty similar numbers [of secondary cases], you are not getting these super-spreading events. Once K is below one, you have got the potential for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-are-super-spreaders-and-how-are-they-transmitting-coronavirus\">super-spreading</a>.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Is K fixed, or does it fluctuate with public health measures, like R does?</strong></h2> \n<p>As with the rate of transmission, there is a K value<strong> </strong>that relates to transmission when you do not have any control measures in place. Once measures are implemented, however, the distribution in transmission changes. \u201cIt is unlikely that with lockdown measures in place you\u2019d see a lot of super-spreading events simply because there aren\u2019t any opportunities for them,\u201d said Kucharski. \u201cSo if you were to analyse that data, you\u2019d probably calculate a different K value because you have got those control measures changing the dynamics of interactions.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>What is the K number for Covid-19?</strong></h2> \n<p>In the absence of public health measures, \u201cthe values that are coming out for Covid-19 seems to be between about 0.1 and 0.5,\u201d said Kucharski. That, he says, means that in the early stages of an outbreak about 10-20% of infections probably generate about 80% of the transmission.</p> \n<p>In other words, super-spreading matters \u2013 a reality highlighted by reports such as that from South Korea where one individual is thought to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/south-korean-city-daegu-lockdown-coronavirus-outbreak-cases-soar-at-church-cult-cluster\">infected dozens of others by attending church</a>.</p> \n<p>But Kucharski cautioned against the use of the term super-spreader. \u201cI think we do have to be really careful about blaming people because often it is not really much about the person, it is much more about the environment they happened to be in while they were infectious,\u201d he said.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is K important?</strong></h2> \n<p>Knowing the K value helps to inform what sort of public health measures may help to reduce R.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we can identify and reduce the situations that are disproportionately driving transmission, then that suggests that we could actually have potentially quite a lot less disruptive measures in place, but still keep the reproduction number low,\u201d said Kucharski.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But it could also be important for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/how-will-englands-coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-work\">test</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/how-will-englands-coronavirus-test-and-trace-system-work\">-and-trace</a> measures, he said. \u201cIf cases occur at random, it\u2019s very hard to track down and stop every chain of transmission. But if cases cluster together, and we can identify those clusters, testing and tracing directed at these situations could have a disproportionate effect on reducing transmission.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>How might the relaxation of the lockdown affect K?</strong></h2> \n<p>Lockdown reduces the chances of a single infectious person spreading the disease to others. \u201cObviously if you start to allow larger gatherings, have larger workplaces, if you have other types of interaction starting, then that does increase the chance that one infection could spread to more people than it would have been able to a couple of weeks ago,\u201d said Kucharski. \u201cIt could decrease the K, but it could also increase the R.\u201d </p>",

For many observers, there was a distinct echo of Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 acceptance speech \u2013 \u201cWe see cities enveloped in smoke and flame\u201d \u2013 and a foreboding that history could take a newly dark and dangerous turn.</p> <p>For three years, the first president elected without political or military experience rode his luck and skirted past disaster. In the fourth year, the fates demanded payback.</p> <p>Not even Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/us-slavery-400-years-virginia-point-comfort\">four centuries of slavery,</a> segregation, police brutality and racial injustice.</p> <p>But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came.</p> <p>Trump, they say, was uniquely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">ill-qualified for this moment.</a> He tried to wish away the threat of the coronavirus and failed to prepare, then paid no heed to how communities of colour bore the brunt of its health and economic consequences. As unrest now grips dozens of cities, he speaks an authoritarian language of \u201cthugs\u201d, \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d.</p> <p>The nation waits in vain for a speech that might heal wounds, find a common sense of purpose and acknowledge the generational trauma of African Americans. That would require deep reading, cultural sensitivity and human empathy \u2013 none of which are known to be among personal attributes of Trump, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/trump-obama-obsession-coronavirus-president\">defines himself in opposition to Barack Obama.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"be3bb9861efb69401b88ebc5ab74166f56655de7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3bb9861efb69401b88ebc5ab74166f56655de7/0_0_5843_3895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather outside the White House on Sunday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather outside the White House on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe is obviously in way over his head,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.mslatoshabrown.com/\">LaTosha Brown,</a> a civil rights activist and co-founder of Black Voters Matter.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a clue. He\u2019s a TV personality. He has a cult following that\u2019s centred around this white power broker persona rooted in white supremacy and racism. Wherever he goes, he carries that role and that kind of persona, but ultimately right now with what we\u2019re looking for in this country is real leadership. He is incapable of providing that because that\u2019s not who he is.\u201d</p> <p>Brown added: \u201cHe\u2019s a personality. He\u2019s used to these dog whistles and, instead of trying to uproot division and seeing that the citizens are actually in pain and hurting, he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to address that. He actually adds fuel to the flames and shows how fundamentally intellectually disconnected he is from what is happening and also how ill-prepared he is as a leader to respond to that.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is not so much a child playing with matches as an arsonist hellbent on burning it all down, Brown warned.</p> <p>\u201cIf it would take the destruction of the country for him to protect his position, he is willing to do that. He has shown that he is willing to kill every single thing in this country, including its people, if it protects him.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He\u2019s willing to kill democracy.

He creates incentives for it to thrive. He has elevated and put people around him that do that as well.\u201d</p> <p>The president\u2019s suggestion of moral equivalence between white nationalists and anti-fascist protesters in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/19/charlottesville-stellenbosch-south-africa-racism-history\">Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017</a> failed to loosen his grip on the Republican party. Perhaps it tightened. At the start of this re-election year, feeling emboldened by his acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial and a robust economy, Trump was confident of his re-election chances.</p> <p>Now, with health, economic and social crises feeding off each other, polls show him trailing rival Joe Biden. But the situation remains volatile and unpredictable. The president has sought to scapegoat anti-fascist protesters, and there would be little surprise if he returned to Nixonian law-and-order rhetoric to rally Republicans and lay a trap for Democrats, portraying them as \u201csoft on crime\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18385303b725c840c6044fdfdfc7904d4a1d02cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18385303b725c840c6044fdfdfc7904d4a1d02cb/0_468_7070_4245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police fire at protesters in Denver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police fire at protesters in Denver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyler Tomasello/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGet tough Democrat Mayors and Governors,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267187902192193538?s=20\">Trump tweeted on Sunday,</a> even as protesters gathered outside the White House for the third straight day. \u201cThese people are ANARCHISTS.

  "<p>Patson Daka has just spent half an hour recounting the journey that led from school playing fields in Zambia to the spearhead of Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s attack, so it seems cheap to follow up with the kind of question that speaks of football\u2019s maddening impatience levels. But he is about to resume a season whose success can be measured by a strike rate of a goal every 74 minutes in Austria\u2019s Bundesliga, so here goes: would it be fair to say he is the next Erling Braut Haaland?</p> <p>There is laughter at one end of the line and some relief at the other. \u201cI\u2019m not the next anything,\u201d Daka says. \u201cThere\u2019ll only be one Haaland and there\u2019ll only be one Patson. I just want to become the best vision of myself.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/02/red-bull-salzburg-anfield-liverpool-scouting-system-mane-keita-champions-league\">Salzburg arrive at Anfield as supreme finders and polishers of diamonds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The image is already a compelling one. Daka may have played second fiddle to Haaland before the Norwegian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/29/borussia-dortmund-manchester-united-signing-erling-braut-haaland\">joined Borussia Dortmund in December</a> but, certainly on a local level, not by much. When Salzburg resume their title chase against Rapid Vienna on Wednesday he will be seeking his 18th&nbsp;goal of the domestic league campaign and he is now their leading man. At 21, he is also the latest player to the fore of a production line whose diversity is unmatched.</p> <p>\u201cErling did his part to help and has left this opportunity for the rest of us, so now it\u2019s time to elevate ourselves also,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was always a kind of competition between the two of us where we wanted to improve each other. In football, and life, things happen quicker for some people and we don\u2019t expect everything to move at the same pace for everyone. I think I\u2019ve needed a bit more time to discover myself and develop more. We all just knew it was his time, his moment.\u201d</p> <p>Daka&nbsp;knows&nbsp;he had ground to make up. One of the few parallels with Haaland\u2019s background was the presence of a footballing father. Growing up in Kafue, a town in south-central Zambia, his earliest memories were of watching his dad, Nathtali, cause havoc on the wings for Nitrogen Stars. Nathtali never needed an excuse to find a ball, or fashion one, and share his passion with his son. But he died before he could see the spectacular returns and Daka is spurred by determination to honour his memory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have the opportunities I have today,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel I have achieved the dream he had for me, to see me play at a high level and come to Europe, and create my own legacy. It drives me every time because, wherever he is today, he is proud of me.\u201d</p> <p>The tale of Daka\u2019s breakthrough involves a mite of good fortune but is primarily a modern success story of talent identification in previously-overlooked areas. In 2012 he was sitting an exam when Airtel Rising Stars \u2013 a pan-African grassroots initiative sponsored by the eponymous telecoms company \u2013 arrived to hold trials behind his school.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d just finished writing when one of my friends told me: \u2018Some people have come to select players to represent the province, maybe we can go and you can try your luck.\u2019 We went along and they were about to start. I knew one of the coaches and he told me to rush home for my training kit so I could be a part of it. I ran there and back. After playing for less then 10 minutes, they removed me from the pitch and said: \u2018OK, wait for us here.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c4ad998fe52c67c2a7a541bc6654b6284c12c08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c4ad998fe52c67c2a7a541bc6654b6284c12c08/0_67_1936_1162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zambia\u2019s Patson Daka (left) gets in ahead of Valentine Ozornwafor of Nigeria in the Africa Under-23 Cup of Nations last November.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zambia\u2019s Patson Daka (left) gets in ahead of Valentine Ozornwafor of Nigeria in the Africa Under-23 Cup of Nations last November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They had seen enough and Daka has not looked back. Within a year he was captaining a Zambia team picked from thousands who had attended Airtel\u2019s trials; they were runners-up at a tournament in Nigeria, where he finished top scorer. He was called up to the senior national team at 16; by then he was a star at under-17 level and already coming under harsh scrutiny in the domestic top flight.</p> <p>\u201cI played one season, scored two goals and gave one assist,\u201d he says of a barren campaign on loan from Kafue Celtics to Nchanga Rangers. \u201cI moved again [to Power Dynamos], scored once in the first half of the season and the fans didn\u2019t want me. At one point almost the whole country didn\u2019t want to see my name in the national team. But then I started scoring in every game and came out top scorer for the club. That\u2019s how things changed.\u201d</p> <p>The rewards would follow. In 2015 he was spotted by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 while playing at the Africa Under-17 Cup of Nations. Kanout\u00e9\u2019s agency, 12 Management, works closely with Salzburg and within two years Daka was playing for their feeder club, FC Liefering.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/manchester-united-extend-odion-ighalo-loan-to-31-january\">Manchester United extend Odion Ighalo's loan to 31 January</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt, no second option,\u201d he says when asked whether Salzburg, whose alumni include Sadio Man\u00e9 and Naby Ke\u00efta, have cultivated the perfect environment for an African player. \u201cTo see how they have made their names here gives me confidence and I feel like: \u2018OK, this is the right place for me.\u2019 It\u2019s the No 1 team for every Zambian now; people are always asking me: \u2018Can you talk to the Red Bull people and ask them to come to us?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Six months after arriving in Austria, Daka was joined by one of his closest friends. Enock Mwepu, a dynamic midfielder destined for the top, was another beneficiary of that Airtel scheme and when they first met as 13-year-olds the idea of a new life 4,500 miles from home would have been a fairytale.</p> <p>\u201cI pushed him so hard, tried to give him tips for what to do and what not to do, so he could also make it and we could be together,\u201d Daka says of Mwepu\u2019s initial arrival on trial. \u201cI was given almost everything I needed here but there\u2019s just that feeling of missing home, so to be with someone who has been like family was some relief and another reason to focus. I did my best to make sure he could show his quality and stay. It had so much impact on me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e41f30f007d26a62b53b2bfc4314414175c222a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e41f30f007d26a62b53b2bfc4314414175c222a/57_172_3371_2023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salzburg\u2019s Patson Daka celebrates after Dominik Szoboszlai scored their first goal in Friday\u2019s cup final win over Austria Lustenau.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salzburg\u2019s Patson Daka celebrates after Dominik Szoboszlai scored their first goal in Friday\u2019s cup final win over Austria Lustenau.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonhard F\u00f6ger/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They would make an attractive package for anyone, although both signed new deals in December. Premier League clubs are understood to be watching Daka closely and would be getting a different kind of player to Haaland. He describes himself as \u201cmore the mobile striker who moves everywhere\u201d, and believes those attributes complemented Haaland\u2019s gifts as a target man.</p> <p>One day he may well follow the likes of Haaland, Man\u00e9, Ke\u00efta and Takumi Minamino in moving to a bigger stage. In the short term his focus is on retaining Salzburg\u2019s title, a task made easier when the previous leaders, Lask Linz, were deducted six points for breaking Covid-19 training regulations. They have already won the cup, beating Austria Lustenau 5-0. The Salzburg centre-forward spot comes with raised expectations nowadays but Daka intends to meet them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always known pressure will be there, but I don\u2019t have to let it define me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to come from Africa and be exposed to a different kind of development. I never imagined myself making the kind of big step I have here.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>A powerful conservative coalition whose key members have strong Trump administration ties, is seeking to raise $5m to back hundreds of doctors pressing states to open rapidly and to build support for new tax cuts and curbing pandemic spending, say its leaders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-brother-philonise-floyd-trump-phone-call\">George Floyd\u2019s brother says Trump \u2018kept pushing me off\u2019 during phone call</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Save Our Country (SOC) coalition was launched in April by veteran advocates of small government policies who lead rightwing groups like FreedomWorks Foundation, Tea Party Patriots and the shadowy state policy network the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec).</p> <p>Nearly all top public health voices, like the White House adviser Dr Anthony Fauci, urge caution in reopening states. There is broad consensus among most public health experts worldwide that too swiftly ending lockdowns risks a potentially devastating second wave of infections in a pandemic that has already cost more than 100,000 American lives.</p> <p>But the Tea Party Patriots have spearheaded a drive, in radio and TV interviews, to mobilize doctors urging states to move faster. It is now attracting broader financial support from rightwing donors and groups in the shape of the SOC. Doctors in the group have also pushed unscientific theories about the pandemic in ways that have sparked anger and criticism.</p> <p>The Tea Party leader Jenny Beth Martin said the group has about 800 members and its mission is to \u201ceducate the American public about the unintended side-effects\u201d of the shutdown. Martin said 800 doctors signed a letter in May to Donald Trump which called the lockdowns a \u201cmass casualty\u201d event causing depression and other ills and urged Trump to end the \u201cnational shutdown\u201d. A copy of the letter is going this week to governors nationwide.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s key groups are dark money non-profits that historically have been funded by a mix of wealthy donors, corporations and conservative foundations. One leading figure in the loose-knit coalition is the FreedomWorks economic adviser and free markets advocate Stephen Moore.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The coalition\u2019s economic and health agendas are drawing fire from scientists and economists of all political stripes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brandon said the SOS coalition has raised just over $800,000 towards a $5m goal for projects including new ad efforts \u2013 online, radio and print \u2013 to rev up grassroots pressure to reopen states faster, plus curtail more federal spending and promote business-favored tax cuts.</p> <p>Los Angeles-based Dr Simone Gold, who has been prominent in the doctors\u2019 drive, was featured over Memorial Day weekend at a rally in Los Angeles which drew the conservative radio host Dennis Prager.</p> <p>According to the Associated Press, the Council for National Policy Action, another SOS member, on 11 May held a call about the doctors\u2019 effort with Trump campaign officials who indicated they plan to launch a similar drive soon. Gold told the AP that there was \u201cno scientific basis that the average American should be concerned about\u201d Covid-19 \u2013 something that downplays all medical evidence about the pandemic\u2019s risks.</p> <p>Gold has also used talk radio to tout the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine \u2013 which Trump has taken in hopes of blocking Covid-19 \u2013 despite growing scientific evidence it carries big health risks.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s economic and health agendas are drawing fire from scientists and economists of all political stripes.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that these organizations have found doctors who are willing to support a rightwing agenda designed to help Donald Trump against all scientific evidence and appropriate public health practices is shameful,\u201d said Irwin Redlener, a professor of public health at Columbia University.</p> <p>Critics notwithstanding, Brandon said the coalition recently spent $50,000 for videos on Facebook, Hulu and Twitter targeting independents and Republicans with the message that Covid-19 mostly hits the elderly to minimize risks for others.&nbsp;</p> <p>FreedomWorks, which boasts an arm whose tax status permits lobbying, has also been prodding the Senate \u201cto pump the brakes on new spending\u201d, Brandon said referring to the $3tn-plus that has already been allocated for corporate relief and the pandemic\u2019s painful fallout for tens of millions. </p> <p>Besides coalition projects, Tea Party Patriots and FreedomWorks have tapped their email lists and social media to mobilize activists to join \u201cliberate\u201d demonstrations in more than 10 states including North Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia and Michigan, with the latter attracting some gun-toting activists.</p> <p>Key groups in the SOC coalition, which has 200 members, have been funded by prominent billionaires, including some who have been active in the sprawling big-money network led by the oil and gas billionaire Charles Koch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/fears-grow-of-surge-in-us-coronavirus-cases-from-george-floyd-protests\">Fears grow of US coronavirus surge from George Floyd protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tea Party Patriots, for instance, received almost $2m in 2017 and 2018 from Richard Uihlein, whose net worth in early 2020 was almost $25bn according to public records.&nbsp;Charles Koch, whose net worth Forbes last month pegged at $46.5bn, has been an Alec funder. The Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus, whose net worth in February was $6.5bn, has backed Job Creators Network which also belongs to the coalition.</p> <p>The coalition and some member groups have held strategy conference calls that include some wealthy donors and underscore White House ties. FreedomWorks and Brandon hosted one such call on May 21 with Vice-President Mike Pence and Moore.</p> <p>&nbsp;A GOP source who heard the call said Pence offered mostly familiar rhetoric about \u201crestoring American greatness\u201d and congratulated the call\u2019s \u201cdistinguished\u201d participants.</p> <p>In turn, Moore stressed FreedomWorks support for a payroll tax cut, an idea Trump has pushed but which has faced bipartisan Senate opposition in part because it mainly helps workers with jobs, and not the tens of millions newly unemployed.</p> <p>Jerry Taylor, who heads the non-partisan Niskanen Center and used to work at Alec leading a taskforce on energy and the environment, faults the coalition\u2019s economic and health analyses.</p> <p>\u201cThe political actors involved with these groups are united both in their hostility to mainstream science \u2013 which they consider a conspiratorial leftist plot to destroy free market capitalism \u2013 and their superficial understanding of economics.&nbsp;Fully reopening the economy will not produce an economic recovery until the coronavirus is contained and can stay contained,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>As the United States responds to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) brazen crackdown on Hong Kong, it is hard to imagine a US president with less credibility than Donald Trump - who just this week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704\">threatened</a> violence against US citizens protesting police brutality and racism - to respond effectively to the CCP\u2019s dangerous infringement on the rights of the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>The rising tensions over Hong Kong are a window into the future of the US-China relationship \u2013 the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist party (CCP), the stakes at play, and how dangerous it is when the United States lacks an effective approach.&nbsp;</p> <p>After the \u201chandover\u201d in 1997, the people of Hong Kong were promised at least 50 years of self-rule and a democratic system of government; the CCP has encroached on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy ever since. Major protests \u2013 including in 2014 and last year \u2013 have been sparked not only by acts of repression by the CCP, but also more recently by the fear that time is running out for Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">law</a> approved by the Chinese mainland\u2019s national people\u2019s congress makes those fears more real than ever. The CCP argues that the inability of the Hong Kong government to deal with protests means that Beijing must step in, a move that violates the promise of separate political systems. The new law authorizes arrests for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52762291\">vague</a> transgressions such as \u201ctreason\u201d, \u201csedition\u201d and \u201csubversion\u201d, raising fears that anyone deemed an opponent of the CCP could be arrested. The law also authorizes the CCP\u2019s security services to operate openly in Hong Kong, formally extending the power of the Chinese security state to Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP views the protests in Hong Kong as a direct threat to the CCP\u2019s autocratic system, and influencing the CCP on this is difficult. But the CCP watches closely for the reactions of the rest of the world, in particular the US. Trump has generally made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less what happens in Hong Kong. At the height of the protests last year, Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/trump-biden-call-xi-secure-server/index.html\">reportedly</a> told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that he would stay quiet about Hong Kong in order to facilitate a trade deal. In public remarks Trump has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/trump-calls-hong-kong-protests-riots-adopting-china-rhetoric\">called</a> the protests \u201criots\u201d and said they are China\u2019s business to handle.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US Congress, however, responded to last year\u2019s events by passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1838/text\">Act</a>, which Trump was forced to sign. That law requires the US secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong remains autonomous, which is a precondition for the US to continue its preferential economic relationship with Hong Kong. On Wednesday, in response to the CCP\u2019s latest move, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/prc-national-peoples-congress-proposal-on-hong-kong-national-security-legislation/\">notified</a> Congress that Hong Kong was not autonomous from the mainland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pompeo\u2019s certification gives the president and secretary of state the ability to impose consequences ranging from sanctions to a complete change in the US-Hong Kong economic relationship. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: Hong Kong\u2019s precarious position as a relatively free, democratic society and a global financial hub are dependent on its special treatment by the United States and the international community. If those relationships change, then Hong Kong, US-China relations and the global financial system will change too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Threatening to change the US relationship with Hong Kong could, conceivably, deter the CCP from further crackdowns, because the CCP benefits financially from Hong Kong\u2019s unique economic status. But if the US upends Hong Kong\u2019s special status, it could help seal the fate of the people of Hong Kong as just another part of the CCP\u2019s autocratic domain. The US cannot do that.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP\u2019s actions are not taking place in a vacuum \u2013 they are illustrative of the broader challenges the CCP poses to the world, and the dilemmas it presents for the US. As tensions rise, and the CCP uses the cover of the global pandemic to aggressively pursue territorial claims from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/china-and-india-move-troops-as-border-tensions-escalate\">India</a> to the South China <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/New-South-China-Sea-tensions-rattle-Manila-and-Hanoi-amid-pandemic\">Sea</a>, the range of threats is only growing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s erratic policies have only made matters worse. His trade war hurts the American economy. His lack of interest in human rights has removed potential deterrents against the CCP\u2019s campaign of ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang and repression in Hong Kong. Trump\u2019s undermining of US alliances and withdrawal from leadership in international organizations has ceded the global playing field to China. The list goes on.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the US develops strategies to confront the challenges posed by the CCP, we will need to embrace policy approaches that Trump has abandoned. That will mean standing up for values, investing in the American economy, working with allies, and strengthening international institutions.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to standing up for Hong Kong today, the US must respond to the passage of the new law with immediate diplomatic pressure. It also needs to send clear public and private <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/09/16/474577/support-democracy-human-rights-asia/\">signals</a> about the measures that the US will take if Beijing follows through with a crackdown on Hong Kong \u2013&nbsp;including targeted sanctions against the officials, security services and companies involved</p> <p>To bring international pressure against the CCP, the US must also put Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy on the agenda of international organizations from the United Nations to the G7.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US must closely coordinate with its allies, in particular the United Kingdom, which has a special role to play as the signatory to the Sino-British Joint Declaration that outlined the terms of Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China. The US has taken a first step in this direction with a joint US-UK-Canada-Australia <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCAlerts/status/1265974905268469763\">statement</a> condemning the CCP\u2019s move.&nbsp;</p> <p>The situation also requires consulting with and following the lead of those on the ground in Hong Kong fighting for their rights. The US must ensure that its actions do everything possible to help the people of Hong Kong rather than sacrificing Hong Kong to make a larger point about the CCP.&nbsp;</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, effectively standing up for values abroad requires upholding universal values at home. The Trump administration\u2019s endless assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions - of which Trump\u2019s threat of violence against Americans is just the most recent shocking illustration - erodes America\u2019s ability to credibly pressure the CCP over its own human rights abuses.</p> <p>Right now, the people of Hong Kong and the US and people across the world need strong, principled American leadership to deal with the challenges posed by the CCP. Three and a half years of Trump\u2019s counterproductive policies \u2013 which the CCP have taken advantage of \u2013 have only made that US leadership more necessary than ever.</p>",

  "<p>The air is clean and fresh, fish have reappeared in urban waterways, birds are frequenting uncut gardens, wild mammals are meandering through cities and greenhouse gas emissions will likely drop by an unprecedented<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-energy-demand-to-plunge-this-year-as-a-result-of-the-biggest-shock-since-the-second-world-war\"> 8% this year</a>. Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/26/united-nations-global-effort-cut-emissions-stop-climate-chaos-2030\">7.6% yearly reduction</a> in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that confirm they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is a second inadvertent link between climate crisis and the coronavirus pandemic that is perhaps less examined. The recovery packages designed and implemented by governments to rescue the ailing global economy could rise as high as $20tn over the next 18 months. The scale of this stimulus will shape the contours of the global economy over the next decade, if not longer. This is precisely the decade when climate scientists have warned global emissions will need to be cut by half in order to reach a sustainable trajectory. In the midst of the crisis wreaked by the pandemic is an opportunity: to ensure rescue packages don\u2019t merely recover the high carbon economy of yesterday, but help us build a healthier economy that is low on carbon, high in resilience and centred on human wellbeing.</p> <p>The case for rebuilding our economies in line with environmental targets has broad public support. A<a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/two-thirds-britons-believe-climate-change-serious-coronavirus-and-majority-want-climate-prioritised\"> recent poll</a> from Ipsos Mori shows that 71% of the global population understands that climate change is as at least as serious a crisis as Covid-19, and 65% think the former should be prioritised in the economic recovery. This is not only in industrialised countries<strong> </strong>that can more easily afford to green their economies; 81% of the citizens in India and 80% of people from Mexico were also strongly in favour of a green and healthy economic recovery.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the first institutions to call for this dual approach was the<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/commentaries/now-is-the-time-to-plan-the-economic-recovery-the-world-needs\"> International Energy Agency</a>, which will publish a report this month detailing policies that governments could adopt to chart the course of recovery while decarbonising their economies. Meanwhile the International Monetary Fund is not only advising that fiscal stimulus packages should be based on green measures, but going as far as recommending<a href=\"https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/04/29/imf-chief-1-trillion-post-coronavirus-stimulus-must-tackle-climate-crisis/\"> scrapping fossil fuel subsidies</a> and taxing carbon.&nbsp;</p> <p>A growing number of corporate leaders are also calling for government stimulus packages to have green strings attached. In the UK, the call from a group of major business leaders for the government to embrace a green recovery was answered by the prime minister\u2019s statement that the UK\u2019s commitment to delivering net zero emissions<a href=\"https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4015202/boris-johnson-promises-prioritise-low-carbon-investment-uk-covid-19-recovery\"> \u201cremains undiminished\u201d.</a> In Europe,<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-14/european-ceos-ministers-start-campaign-for-green-recovery\"> 180 business leaders</a>, policymakers and researchers explicitly urged the EU to build the recovery package around the Green Deal. Meanwhile the Spanish government recently released a draft law banning all new coal, oil and gas projects, establishing the direction of the Covid-19 recovery effort. In Canada, <a href=\"https://cleanenergycanada.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=14af3f96b3d5df9564694d168&amp;id=c498eb3db8&amp;e=8c32efcdc6\">more than </a><a href=\"https://cleanenergycanada.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=14af3f96b3d5df9564694d168&amp;id=c498eb3db8&amp;e=8c32efcdc6\">320 signatories representing more than 2,100 companies</a> have signed on to support a resilient recovery.</p> <p>Perhaps most surprising are the carbon-intensive industries that have confirmed they are continuing to decarbonise despite the pandemic, including BP, Shell, Daimler and Rio Tinto.

He\u2019s Generation Z\u2019s answer to Leonardo DiCaprio, or Robert Pattinson, or James Dean. More than just talent, commercial appeal or dreamy good looks, he possesses that teen heartthrob quality born of boyishness: intensity, vulnerability, androgyny and a certain amount of stubble-free cheekbone action. Chalamet seems to appeal to all genders and sexualities, and today that appeal is measured less by posters on bedroom walls than adoring posts online. It is Chalamet who is inserted by fans into classic works of art on Instagram, who is the subject of memes, whose every style choice is met with gushing approval, and who can send the internet into a frenzy with a mere photo of his larder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1567a781b5ba8c1c71117f0f4caa978043f45346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1567a781b5ba8c1c71117f0f4caa978043f45346/819_0_2685_1612/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Henry V in The King.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bowled over ...

He is the only actor still under 30 with a best actor Oscar nomination, and after Call Me By Your Name, Lady Bird and Little Women, he has established a neat line in louche, sophisticated teens, world-weary beyond their years, yet captivatingly sensitive. The question is whether Chalamet can graduate beyond dreamy teens and score a bona fide hit, like DiCaprio did with Titanic, or Pattinson with Twilight. His Henry V in last year\u2019s The King was the perfect boy-to-man transitional role but Chalamet didn\u2019t quite pull it off (the bowl haircut may have been a factor). But he still has the sci-fi epic Dune to come, not to mention Wes Anderson\u2019s The French Dispatch, a Call Me By Your Name sequel and a rumoured Bob Dylan biopic.</p> <p>In that respect, A Rainy Day in New York represents a step backwards. It was filmed three years ago, when Chalamet was still in dreamy teen mode. The story rehashes so many old Allen themes \u2013 age-inappropriate relationships, ditzy young women, anachronistic witticisms \u2013 it might as well have been written by an algorithm, but Chalamet emerges unscathed. He has since distanced himself from the film in light of Allen\u2019s growing toxicity, and donated his salary to Time\u2019s Up and other charities. Ironically, the film he is least proud of could be the one that cements his movie star status. </p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;A Rainy Day in New York is available in the UK on premium on demand services from 5 June</p>",
  "<p>When coronavirus crept across the world in early February, talk of how different nations were dealing with the virus came to resemble the Olympics for state capacity. Which country had the authority, the supplies and the expertise to \u201ccrush the curve\u201d? A balance sheet of national progress marked out a bleak race to the horizon, enumerated in case numbers and death figures.</p> <p>Although the focus over recent months has remained on leaders in crisis mode and the central agencies delivering forecasts and quarantine measures, local authorities have also played a prominent role during the pandemic. Chinese mayors, US governors and Indian chief ministers have coordinated local responses, taking responsibility for populations and even <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-28/alcohol-spat-shows-india-states-battling-modi-for-virus-billions\">locking horns</a> with national politicians.</p> <p>Most people would read the pandemic as a sign that populations and nation states should band together, and<strong> </strong>for the people \u201cat the head of the rope\u201d to pull even harder, to use the metaphor favoured by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But there are others who see matters quite differently. They spy opportunity in the crisis, and wager that we might be able to ride the wave of the pandemic into a new tomorrow, where the virus shatters the global map \u2013 and undermines the power of democratic nation states.</p> <p>The US is ground zero for this type of thinking. Across the country, regions have broken up into \u201ccompacts\u201d, with states competing against each other for life-saving ventilators and PPE. The atmosphere is one of competitive federalism, where states are reconfigured as economic units bidding in a marketplace. Washington\u2019s state governor, Jay Inslee, accused Trump<strong> </strong>of<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jay-inslee-trump-twitter-coronavirus-washington-liberate-america-a9471681.html\"> \u201cfomenting domestic rebellion\u201d</a> for his calls to \u201cliberate\u201d individual states; governor Gavin Newsom termed California a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/california-coronavirus-newsom-nation-state.html\">\u201cnation-state.\u201d</a> One Maryland governor confessed to keeping Covid-19 <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/495519-maryland-governor-says-coronavirus-tests-acquired-from-south-korea-under\">tests in an undisclosed location under armed guard</a>, in part to prevent their seizure by central state authorities.</p> <p>Although North America\u2019s economy is gradually reopening, the virus is still rampaging through its population. What will economic recovery look like in the midst of a pandemic? The president\u2019s economic advisers have some ideas. In an <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">analysis</a> released at the end of April, Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore, two of Trump\u2019s closest economic confidants and authors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/trumponomics-trump-reaganism-authoritarian-wall-street-main-street\">the book on \u201cTrumponomics\u201d</a>, predicted that \u201cblue\u201d Democratic states would be slower than \u201cred\u201d states to recover, because of what they saw as their pre-existing excess of regulations and taxes.</p> <p>Their analysis divided the US map into <a href=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1162126/2020_04_28_When_and_Where_Will_the_Recovery_Happen_ID_ee44b445dd92.pdf?p=pdf\">\u201claggard anti-growth\u201d states and \u201cmomentum pro-growth\u201d</a> states. The former have minimum wages, pro-union laws and state income tax; the latter are free of such regulations.<strong> </strong>In the established mode of disaster capitalism, Laffer and Moore\u2019s analysis appears to see the pandemic as a way to compel \u201canti-growth\u201d states to adopt ever lower tax rates in order to attract mobile capital and labour. It suggests those who resist will not be bailed out by redistribution from the central government, but left to languish in a deserved economic depression. The effect is reminiscent of social Darwinism, applied as a philosophy of government.</p> <p>The most articulate cheerleader for this kind of post-pandemic libertarianism is Balaji Srinivasan, the electrical engineer and former general partner at Silicon Valley venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. Since the pandemic began, Srinivasan has foretold a redivision of the world map into \u201cgreen zones\u201d that have controlled and contained the virus and \u201cred zones\u201d, which have not.</p> <p>\u201cWe are entering this fractal environment,\u201d Srinivasan <a href=\"https://hopin.to/events/virtual-startup-societies-summit-special-jurisdictions-in-a-post-covid-world\">recently</a> told a virtual summit organised by the Startup Societies Foundation, \u201cin which the virus breaks centralised states\u201d. The virus does not stop at the border, so nor will this process of fragmentation. As regions seal themselves off to prevent contagion, \u201cyou can drill down to the state, or even the town or county level\u201d, Srinivasan observed, noting that any state without the virus under control will \u201cface defection\u201d in an intensified contest for talent and capital. After the pandemic has passed, \u201cnations are going to turn into effectively vendors and entrepreneurs and relatively mobile people will be applicants\u201d, he predicted.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to imagine how a particular breed of investor could see this pandemic as an opportunity that will accelerate existing trends. The loose attachments that investors feel towards this or that nation will grow even looser as capital becomes more mobile, and a sorting process will separate the productive few nations from the malingering many. States that don\u2019t fall in line with the demands of this investor class will be starved by the voluntary expatriation of the wealthy, with their assets and abilities in tow.</p> <p>If you assume this is merely a pessimistic vision, you\u2019d be wrong. In fact it accords with a long-cultivated ideology that Srinivasan shares with a group of like-minded venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, who subscribe to variations of the radical libertarian philosophy known as \u201canarcho-capitalism\u201d. The idea at its root is that a wealthy class of investors and entrepreneurs should be free to exit nation states and form new communities whose members can choose which rules (and tax laws) they\u2019re governed by \u2013 as if those rules were products on a store shelf. </p> <p>For like-minded libertarians, the colour-coded zones used in public health to control the virus are the blueprint for a new political economy. Since Srinivasan began discussing the framework, colour-coded zones have been rolled out to control the virus in Malaysia, Indonesia, Northern Italy and France; the strategy was also considered as a model for biocontainment <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/kushner-coronavirus-surveillance-174165\">in the White House</a> in early April. As of early May, India has divided its 1.3 billion people into a patchwork of green, yellow and red zones, with different freedoms and restrictions based on each.</p> <p>The red-green zone schema has already informed the strategies of global investors. In April, Henley &amp; Partners, the global citizenship broker, released its annual ranking of national passports for mobile investors, and predicted that coronavirus would spark a dramatic shift in global mobility. Its chief source <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/record-breaking-global-mobility-grounded-by-covid-19-pandemic-301034963.html\">forecast</a> that \u201cas the curtain lifts, people will seek to move from poorly governed and ill-prepared \u2018red zones\u2019 to \u2018green zones\u2019, or places with better medical care.\u201d In early May, it <a href=\"https://robbreport.com/travel/destinations/super-rich-buying-pandemic-passports-multiple-nationalities-2918500/\">reported</a> a 42% increase in applications for new nationalities, compared with the previous year.</p> <p>Nobody can tell what the world will look like after the pandemic. But what we can be sure of is that some investors appear to be already placing<strong> </strong>their bets on a vision of the future where the wealthy are freed from tax constraints. As nations are divided into different zones according to their respective stages of viral and economic recovery, the well-off could follow Elon Musk\u2019s recent threat to relocate from California to Texas, voting with their feet for locations that elude redistributive taxation. In our post-pandemic future, the flight to safety, away from contagious \u201cred zones\u201d, could be a flight from the nation state as we know it.</p> <p>\u2022 Quinn Slobodian is an associate professor of history at Wellesley College, US&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>For years, GDP growth targets have been the be-all and end-all of China\u2019s economy. They were the imperfect but convenient measure of economic expansion and prosperity, the ultimate economic objective for the central government, and the yardstick of achievement for local governments.</p> <p>Officials at various levels \u2013 provincial, county and city \u2013 competed in a tournament of who could generate the highest GDP growth rates, and who could expand their local economies the fastest. Some transformed their municipalities into export hubs, some into manufacturing powerhouses, while others mined coal and constructed housing. It mattered less how it was achieved \u2013 the goal was to meet, and to exceed, these targets.</p> <p>The rewards for local officials were plentiful: visibility, respect, the upgrading of their cities to a higher status (Chinese cities are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_city_tier_system\">ranked in a tier system</a>), and most importantly, the possibility of being promoted to a higher rung on the political ladder. These were the highly charged incentives to push for GDP growth, and what made the growth model in China <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=CN\">work so effectively</a> over 30 years.</p> <p>This makes it all the more remarkable that, on 22 May, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, announced at the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress that there would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/china-abandons-gdp-target-for-first-time-in-years-amid-great-uncertainty-of-virus\">no GDP growth target</a> set for this year. This is the first time this has happened since the targets were introduced in 1990. Because of the global coronavirus pandemic, the growth rate of any economy in any part of the world is going to struggle to stay above 0%. It would be pointless, the government has decided, to set a target of 6% when extrinsic factors dictate where the economy is going. But if the move becomes the norm and stays as the default option, it would represent a new mindset, and major progress for China on several fronts.</p> <p>First, getting rid of targets would signal a shift from a quantity-based economic development model, to a quality-based one. Slowing down the economy would mean less <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/01/dramatic-fall-in-china-pollution-levels-partly-related-to-coronavirus\">pressure on the environment</a>. It would also mean that local governments could shift their priorities to improving people\u2019s livelihoods, by eradicating poverty, for example, or reducing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/aug/19/china-poverty-inequality-development-goals\">urban-rural inequality</a>, and providing better social services.</p> <p>It would free up resources for the entire economy to produce better products, not just more things. So far, the economy has relied on making as much stuff as possible, as quickly as possible. This is a national attitude true of ambitious local officials, real estate companies, private entrepreneurs, and even national universities. But this short-termism means less focus on investing for the long term, and on conducting vital research that does not have immediate gains. Patience is what China needs.</p> <p>Second, for decades, China has been growing rapidly, but at a high cost: environmental degradation, an imbalanced economy, and perverse incentives featuring an investment craze and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/15/imf-warns-china-debt-slowdown-financial-crisis\">credit addiction</a>. In this world of rapid housing construction, bridges and buildings have been torn down and rebuilt again, and more than <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gthCDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=more+than+6,000+industrial+parks+china&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LR97bXqpzk&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Nea3fj952EMFqMtppvjcRDnEFLQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwizwd6o5djpAhXCgVwKHXzFB0IQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=more%20than%206%2C000%20industrial%20parks%20china&amp;f=false\">6,000 industrial parks</a> constructed around the country. Not all investment has been productive, and not all resources have been well-used. In recent years, growth has increasingly come from borrowing and spending rather than from rising productivity improvements. The upshot is mountainous debt burdens that now threaten China\u2019s financial stability and thwart economic dynamism.</p> <p>Third, it may change some of its international practices. The incentives will no longer be about maximising export volumes to help fulfil growth targets. There are pressures for self-sufficiency coming from all directions in the global arena: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/global-markets-donald-trump-us-china-trade-war-coronavirus-covid-19\">trade wars</a>, the pandemic, rising geopolitical tensions, and a backlash against globalisation. Practically, this may mean fewer state subsidies to promote exports, less reliance on foreign consumption, and less of a rush to acquire resources abroad. But its shift towards producing higher-quality manufacturing products could also bring its exports into more direct competition with those made in advanced economies.</p> <p>A potential problem with abandoning the GDP targets is reduced incentives for local officials. These targets have created powerful motivation for these cadres to implement reforms and try novel and creative policies, such as setting up \u201cspecial economic zones\u201d that mimic open and unfettered markets, or building the world\u2019s first smart cities, <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/3027415/president-xis-dream-city-xiongan-pushes-ahead-smart-city\">such as Xiongan</a>.</p> <p>But this works less well when objectives are multi-dimensional. If local governments are assessed on a range of factors such as local employment numbers, social stability, environmental standards, and technological development, some may have mutually conflicting goals. Without local incentives to propel the economy, growth rates may slow down significantly. That said, even if China\u2019s economy grows at 5% a year, and assuming that the US grows at 1.5%, its economy will still become the world\u2019s largest within about 10 years, even if it takes several decades for the country itself to become as rich as the US.</p> <p>GDP growth targets set an expectation, and when unmet, provoke anxiety and pessimism in the population, even when the economy is doing fine. With greater uncertainties around the world, the Chinese leadership may find managing the economy without these targets even harder. But, ultimately, putting more emphasis on the \u201cmeans\u201d rather than the \u201cends\u201d of modern development would be a smart move. A China of slower but higher-quality growth may not just be good news for Chinese people, but also for the rest of the world.</p> <p>\u2022 Keyu Jin is a professor of economics at LSE</p>",

  "<p>Reports in the Financial Times that Labour\u2019s new shadow City minister wants to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/199c88dc-db88-466f-8616-d34d3c01724e\">repair bridges</a>\u201d with Britain\u2019s financial services industry read oddly to me. I remember accompanying the then shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, on his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f852ca7e-70c0-11e8-852d-d8b934ff5ffa\">tea offensive</a>\u201d meetings with City figures \u2013 with the emphasis on the cups of tea and digestive biscuits, rather than the offence.&nbsp;</p> <p>McDonnell had the great advantage of dramatically low expectations among the bigwigs of high finance, who (as he joked to them) would turn up half-expecting to be sent to a re-education camp by the end of the meeting. They actually left, as far as could be told, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/should-the-city-trust-john-mcdonnell-comrade-charming-csnjfvznt\">pleasantly surprised</a>. But behind the joke, and McDonnell\u2019s personal charm, was a serious attempt to address the issue that any Labour shadow chancellor or chancellor will run up against: what is the party\u2019s relationship to finance?</p> <p>It\u2019s unavoidable, because Britain contains arguably the world\u2019s most important global financial hub. If you aspire to form a government here, there is no path to doing so that does not, at some point, run through the City of London. The truth is that Labour party shadow Treasury teams \u2013 whether from the left, centre or right of the party \u2013 tend to have a lot in common in this respect. John Smith, shadow chancellor before becoming Labour leader, had his early 1990s \u201cprawn cocktail offensive\u201d with the financial sector. Gordon Brown praised the financiers right up until the 2007-8 crash. <a href=\"https://www.john-mcdonnell.net/74-2/\">McDonnell</a> promised the financial sector that it would have \u201ca seat at the policymaking and policy delivery table\u201d.</p> <p>This might sound surprising. Particularly in the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/global-financial-crisis-key-stages\">global </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/global-financial-crisis-key-stages\">financial </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/07/global-financial-crisis-key-stages\">crisis</a> only a decade ago, public opprobrium against the bankers was sky-high, and the ability of international finance to bring leftwing governments to heel occupies a major space in the left\u2019s folk memory: Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s government in France, and, more recently, Syriza in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/26/greece-was-never-bailed-out---it-remains-a-debtors-prison-and-the-eu-still-holds-the-keys\">Greece</a> are the standout examples. There is also a longstanding critique from the left in Britain, which views the whole economy as distorted by the excesses of \u201cbad\u201d, unproductive finance, leaving \u201cgood\u201d, productive capital starved of investment.&nbsp;</p> <p>There\u2019s a substantial truth in the last point. Evidence from the OECD <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/finance-and-inclusive-growth_5js06pbhf28s-en\">suggests</a> that, not just for Britain, but across the world over the last 50 years, larger domestic financial systems tend to slow growth and worsen inequality. But pointing to an issue does not solve it. Nor, as the 2008 crisis unhappily revealed, does the left\u2019s preferred policy of nationalisation necessarily make finance behave any better \u2013 as the accusations of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84f65b10-1650-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44\">widespread inappropriate treatment of customers</a>\u201d at the majority state-owned RBS\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/s166-rbs-grg.pdf\">global </a><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/s166-rbs-grg.pdf\">restructuring </a><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/s166-rbs-grg.pdf\">group</a> suggest. <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2020-05/1589291707_who-wins-and-who-pays-may20.pdf\">New figures</a> from the Institute for Public Policy Research show that 22% of the government\u2019s job retention scheme money is making its way straight back into the financial system. Simply making the state bigger, or more generous, is not enough to shift the underlying balance of power. Instead, a future social democratic government intent on serious reform needs to base its thinking about financial services on three fundamental points.</p> <p>First, financial services are not a monolith. What insurance companies want is not the same as what hedge funds want, and this is not the same as what the major banks are after. The critical point for a reforming government is to understand where those differences lie, and to make distinctions between different types of activity. While clearly some financial activities and institutions \u2013 hedge funds, for example \u2013 are very much driven by short-term gains, others \u2013 like pension funds \u2013 have interests that are far more closely aligned to those of a would-be reforming government.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pension funds look for long-term, stable investments that produce steady returns; potentially the sorts of investment in renewable power generation, or new public transport, for instance, that are so urgently needed. Policy should be designed around an understanding of these varied interests. Some of that should include support for a greater variety of financial institutions, catering for local, regional and sector-specific needs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, the global financial system itself is not primed to trash a reforming government in Britain. With a floating exchange rate and interest rates on government borrowing at world-historic lows, neither currency speculation nor the attacks of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_vigilante\">bond vigilantes</a>\u201d, pushing up interest rates, are the dangers they might once have been. Instead, in a world where international co-operation is in short supply, the bigger risks are from <em>political</em> decisions taken elsewhere that can threaten financial stability here.</p> <p>For instance, Britain\u2019s financial institutions require access to the EU\u2019s vast capital markets. Outside of the EU, however, this access is no longer a right, but conditional on Brussels\u2019 approval. The commission has already used the threat of withdrawing access rights to put pressure on<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/574ce2e6-c49d-11e8-bc21-54264d1c4647\"> Switzerland in negotiations</a>. It could do so against other non-members. Similarly, the operation of the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u201cswap lines\u201d \u2013 cheap, fast access to dollars, essential in a crisis and reopened for the Bank of England in March \u2013 depends on decisions made in Washington. These are more diplomatic challenges than they are financial constraints and there is no reason to act as if global finance is the biggest danger a future Labour government might face.</p> <p>Third, the challenges facing society \u2013 even before Covid-19 \u2013 are now so large that every part of the economy is affected, reducing distinctions between the interests of finance and the interests of other businesses. Climate breakdown, and environmental destruction generally, directly threatens billions of pounds of investments across the globe. Former Bank of England governor <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/review/r151009a.pdf\">Mark Carney was ahead of the curve</a> in raising the risk of climate breakdown to financial stability, and major asset managers are themselves reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/15/blackrock-climate-change-environment-divestment-coal\">looking to divest from high-climate risk investments</a>.

  "<p>The 2020 13in MacBook Pro is the last of Apple\u2019s laptops to get its new and improved keyboard, banishing various issues to the rear view mirror and essentially perfecting this current design.</p> <p>Despite both sharing the same name, the 2020 13in MacBook Pro is split into two lines: a cheaper version starting at \u00a31,299 with two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and older eighth-generation Intel chips; and a more powerful version starting at \u00a31,799 with four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and the latest 10th-generation Intel chips.</p> <p>It is the latter machine reviewed here but both two and four-port machines share the same design, including screen, keyboard and trackpad, leaving processing power and connectivity the differentiators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8ee6ac373419469d73ca181ca14dfd622f44593\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ee6ac373419469d73ca181ca14dfd622f44593/651_397_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2020 apple 13in macbook pro review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple\u2019s sleek, aluminium design hasn\u2019t changed much over the years, but is still one of the best-looking laptops you can buy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apple has kept the laptop\u2019s design more or less the same since 2016 when the Touch Bar was introduced.

The keys feel good with a subtle doming, and the 1mm key-travel \u2013 the distance the key sinks when pressed \u2013 is enough to be satisfying while still being firm and stable.</p> <p>The Touch Bar remains largely untouched.

  "<p>When Liz Dixon-Spain got married in 1967, there was only one place where she wanted to celebrate \u2013 in her parent\u2019s garden with this beautiful beech tree (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>) overlooking the festivities. She planted daffodils around it just for the occasion. \u201cIt felt wonderful having the tree in the background,\u201d says the 73-year-old from South Holland, Lincolnshire. \u201cI have been friends with it all my life.\u201d</p> <p>Holding wedding receptions in the garden has become something of a family tradition, with her two sisters also celebrating their nuptials next to the tree in 1974 and then 1977. The beech has been a constant presence in her family\u2019s lives. \u201cIt is part of all of our family memories because they all happened around the tree,\u201d Liz says.</p> <p>When she was a child, Liz often played around the tree with her siblings and enjoyed watching it come to life as a \u201chome to generations of wildlife\u201d. \u201cThere were tawny owls, as well as all the usual garden birds, with pheasants also roosting in its branches. Hedgehogs, squirrels, rabbits, muntjac deer, dormice, frogs and toads have all sheltered in the plants growing under this tree.\u201d</p> <p>After her marriage ended, she moved back to her childhood home, an old vicarage, where she has been living ever since. \u201cWe think our lovely tree is at least 130 years old \u2013 around the same age as the house.\u201d</p> <p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, she would open up the garden to the public as part of the national garden scheme. Visitors were just as impressed when they first caught a glimpse of the tree. \u201cThe house is three storeys and on a hill, so you can see just how big the tree is,\u201d says Liz. \u201cLooking at it from inside the house is fantastic, but to stand right underneath feels extraordinary. It\u2019s in the middle of the garden and it\u2019s so large, it\u2019s almost trying to get into the house.\u201d</p> <p>The tree has also become a major part of her children and grandchildren\u2019s lives too. Liz has four grownup sons, who spent their childhood playing tennis marathons on the grass in front of the tree. Her children and eight grandchildren live across the UK, in London, Scotland, Southport and Stamford. \u201cThey come here to meet up. The tree brings us together.\u201d</p> <p>One of her grandchildren, Frank, 10, lives in Hackney, east London, but visits Liz often.

It will be given to Covid-19 patients for the first time next month. In a number of conditions it has been shown that if it is nebulised rather than injected, it can \u201chave a dramatic effect in the lung\u201d, said Wilkinson. \u201cIt is a big sticky molecule which can attach to viruses and stop them from entering cells and secondly it may have an important anti-inflammatory effect\u201d. Tests of heparin will be highly anticipated because it is already widely used, shown to be widely tolerated, and is naturally occurring and therefore can be produced cheaply in huge quantities if proven to be effective.&nbsp;</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Bemcentinib, a tablet developed by the Norwegian company BerGenBio, which is used to treat blood disorders. \u201cIt has been shown, almost by chance, to have a potent antiviral effect\u201d to reduce infection in experiments on a number of viruses including Ebola and Sars coronavirus-2, said Wilkinson. It appears to work by preventing the virus infecting the cells but also by reducing its replication within healthy cells by keeping the innate immunity created by type 1 interferon proteins active. Healthy cells usually \u201cswitch off the entire machinery so the virus can\u2019t hijack it\u201d, said Wilkinson, but Covid-19 \u201csubverts this\u201d and this drug may help cells against viral attack, he added.&nbsp;</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Medi3506, an anti-inflammatory injection being developed for skin disorders and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but which has also been used in trials for asthma by AstraZeneca.&nbsp;It acts to dampen down the <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/term/cytokine-storm/\">cytokine storm</a> that causes the immune system to go into overdrive and cause fever, inflammation and fatigue.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Calquence, another AstraZeneca drug, used to treat mantle cell lymphoma. It acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme known as Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and was developed for severe lung inflammation. It was chosen for a formal trial after anecdotal evidence showed a reduced incidence of complications from Covid infection or severe lung injuries.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Zilucoplan, a drug developed by the Belgian biopharma company UCB, which is already in trial for potential treatment of myasthenia gravis, a skeleto-muscular disorder. Hopes centre on its ability to stop the overactivation of \u201ccomplement cascade\u201d, part of the immune system that can kill cells and lead to catastrophic lung and tissue damage. \u201cA lot of the damage is focused on the blood cells and the very small blood vessels in the lung.\u201d</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The drugs were chosen from a list of 200 potential candidates and if they do not work for Covid-19, another batch will then be considered for trials.</p> \n<p>Should the trials deliver positive results, they will feed into the later-phase national research programme being run by Oxford University.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>While reducing Covid-19 infection is everyone\u2019s goal, falling patient numbers present a problem for scientists researching treatments and vaccines. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is why it is important to get every single patient you can into a trial and that is an important message. If a patient is eligible for any of the studies, whether it be a Accord or vaccine studies or other drug trials, they should be offered the opportunity to take part as we know that they\u2019re making a very valuable contribution to their own health and also to public health,\u201d said Wilkinson.</p> \n<p>Sixty patients per drug will need to be assessed over the next few months and Wilkinson said that, if needed, researchers would look to work with other countries and possibly coronavirus patients who are not sent to hospital but have strong symptoms.&nbsp;</p>",

Miners enjoyed a special status as proud contributors to energy independence in the socialist state. <em>Ich bin Bergmann, wer ist mehr?</em> (I\u2019m a miner, who is more?) was a phrase commonly heard during the cold war.</p> \n<p>Germany pledged last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/26/germany-agrees-to-end-reliance-on-coal-stations-by-2038\">to end all coal mining by 2038</a> in line with its EU and global climate obligations. This has deepened existing political tensions in its coal-dependent regions.</p> \n<p>In Lusatia, it has placed <a href=\"https://www.ende-gelaende.org/en/\">climate activists</a> on a collision course with local politicians, the coal companies and the communities whose incomes depend on coal.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoal is a very emotive topic here,\u201d says Adrian Rinnert from the local NGO Strukturwandel Jetzt, which has opposed the expansion of these mines for nearly a decade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/germany_coal_mines_map/giv-3902A77YRRgg3Oem/\" data-alt=\"Europe's largest lignite mines - map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/germany_coal_mines_map/giv-3902A77YRRgg3Oem/\">Europe's largest lignite mines - map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The big problem, he thinks, is the lack of alternative economic opportunities.

The UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Italy and Slovakia will all exit coal before 2025. Spain produced 70% less coal-powered energy in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/spain-nears-life-without-coal-sooner-than-anyone-thought\">is predicted to achieve full </a>closure by 2027. But Germany wants to keep production going well into the 2030s and some mines are expanding. Witt cites <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/germany-s-farewell-to-coal-complicated-by-new-uniper-plant\">the new Datteln IV coal plant</a> that Germany will add to the grid this summer, a move protesters call <a href=\"https://www.waz.de/staedte/witten/witten-protest-gegen-steinkohlekraftwerk-datteln-4-id229167698.html\">\u201cclimate policy madness\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The coal lobby, and many politicians, argue that Germany still needs lignite because it is already committed to shuttering nuclear power plants by 2022. And <a href=\"https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/erneuerbare-energien-experten-kritisieren-zu-geringes-tempo.769.de.html?dram:article_id=450779\">renewables are being built at </a>a pace too slow to meet the country\u2019s current energy needs.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being <em>Georg Ortmann</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\u201cThe energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being,\u201d says Ortmann, the miner.</p> \n<p>He points to the dark layer at the bottom of the pit. Here, plants and trees that grew on this spot 17m years ago are exposed by the machines, now mostly in the form of black coal. Some of the wood is still visible, but once laid bare it will decompose quickly in the fresh air.</p> \n<p>The coal companies\u2019 logic is that since the damage to the environment has already been done, existing mines should be exploited to the maximum. But that can mean expanding brown coalfields by digging them out from underneath <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/human-rights-mining-german-villagers-take-on-coal-giant-rwe\">existing villages</a>. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bulldozing a village </strong></h2> \n<p>One of those villages is M\u00fchlrose. LEAG, the Czech-owned coal firm that runs Boxberg, wants to add the lignite-rich land beneath the village to its current mine. So M\u00fchlrose will be razed and locals rehoused in the nearby town of Schleife. Even the graves in the cemetery will be moved.</p> \n<p>Of the village\u2019s original 600 inhabitants, only 200 remain. But people\u2019s lives should not be uprooted for a dying industry, Rinnert says.</p> \n<p>Yet some in M\u00fchlrose say they are tired of living next door to a coalmine and are ready to move. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered here for years,\u201d says Reinhild Martin.

Nearly everyone was employed by the coal company. Men in the mines, women in the cafeterias. At the same time, the noise and pollution were almost unbearable.</p> \n<p>Thick layers of brown or grey coal dust would be carried by the wind, lodging on window panes and clinging to the laundry on the line, Martin remembers. Over the years, she claims, M\u00fchlrose people died of lung cancer, but the matter was never officially investigated.</p> \n<p>Although it pains her to leave, Martin looks forward to a fresh start with the compensation. </p> \n<p>\u201cOnce they start ripping down the houses, I don\u2019t want to return to the village. Those that left before and that came back to see the devastation never really recovered from the sight,\u201d she says. </p> \n<p>In communist East Germany, forced displacement was part of everyday life in mining regions. An estimated 30,000 people in the Lusatia region were relocated and more than 130 villages destroyed.</p> \n<p>Next to the human cost the environmental impact is a lasting one, too. Germany\u2019s lignite mines have destroyed 175,000 hectares of <a href=\"https://www.bund.net/fileadmin/user_upload_bund/_migrated/publications/150330_bund_broschuere_zukunft_statt_braunkohle.pdf\">the country\u2019s landscape</a>. Soil here is considered dead since nothing grows in it afterwards. And once the mine shuts and the pumps regulating the water levels are turned off, the ground becomes waterlogged.</p> \n<p>Rinnert says recultivating disused pits for tourism and other uses has had mixed success and is not sustainably planned. \u201cThe coal companies are making an effort now, but who will pay once their operations stop and their money runs out?\u201d </p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/17/lusatian-lake-district-project-east-germany\">old mines</a> have been flooded to <a href=\"https://www.leag.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/bergbau/cottbuser-ostsee/\">create artificial lakes</a>, but managing the water quality is a long-term project. \u201cRight now no guarantees exist that the companies will continue to care for the lakes.

  "<p>Total Recall is a movie about a totalitarian government that\u2019s colonized another planet so it can charge ordinary people to breathe. There would be no conflict in the film without it: no serpentine Philip K Dick plot about a construction worker whose dreams of being a secret agent on Mars are rooted in real memories. No skirmishes between the authorities and the pocket of mutants, deviants and ne\u2019er-do-wells who rebel against them from Martian red-light district of Venusville. And certainly none of the scrotum kicks, impalings or gruesome fusillades of machine-gun fire that audiences had come to expect from an Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/23/the-shining-at-40-will-we-ever-fully-understand-what-it-all-means\">The Shining at 40: will we ever fully understand what it all means?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the director Paul Verhoeven, Total Recall was the next step in his own improbable colonization of Hollywood, following RoboCop three years earlier. Verhoeven had already established himself in his native Holland as a craftsman and provocateur of the first order, eager to test the extremes of sexuality and violence \u2013 his first English-language film was appropriately titled Flesh + Blood \u2013 and indulge a fetish for Hitchcockian blondes and mankind\u2019s darkest impulses. As a small child, Verhoeven had lived through the Nazi occupation and the experience shaped him, not only in films that would address the war directly, like Soldier of Orange and Black Book, but in genre entertainments that smuggled themes about life under fascism.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFMLGEHdIjE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WFMLGEHdIjE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>From a distance of 30 years, it\u2019s now possible to look at Total Recall as the middle part of an unofficial sci-fi/action trilogy about authoritarian governance, bookended by RoboCop and Starship Troopers, but it didn\u2019t seem that political at the time. Verhoeven\u2019s talent for delivering the hard-R goods has always given him the latitude to slip more subversive sentiments into his work, and even the overt satire of RoboCop and Starship Troopers was often ignored or misunderstood during their original run. Now that the future Verhoeven predicted has come to pass \u2013 in corporate and militarized law enforcement, in the propaganda used to sell the public on pointless and endless war \u2013 his intent seems more obvious. But his career in Hollywood, for as long as it lasted, was often about getting away with something.&nbsp;</p> <p>Loosely based on the Philip K Dick short story We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, Total Recall is about Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), a beefy construction worker in 2084 who lives a modest and happy life with his wife Lori (Sharon Stone), but keeps having vivid dreams of Mars. To scratch this insistent itch, he visits a company called Rekall, which promises interstellar vacations without the risk and expense of boarding a shuttle. Through memory implants, Quaid can order up a two-week trip to Mars that\u2019s as vivid as if he\u2019d gone there himself \u2013 and for a few hundred credits more, he can travel as another character, so he chooses \u201csecret agent\u201d. The procedure goes terribly awry, due to the fact that the Rekall implant clashes with Quaid\u2019s actual memories of being a secret agent on Mars, which nefarious forces have suppressed. It turns out that his current life has been a lie, and it\u2019s going to take an actual trip to Mars for Quaid to unravel this conspiracy and discover who he really is.&nbsp;</p> <p>From there, Verhoeven, working from a heavily fussed-over screenplay credited to Ronald Shusett, Dan O\u2019Bannon and Gary Goldman, departs from the text. Like a lot of Dick\u2019s short stories, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale retreats into metaphysical space where Quaid\u2019s real and false memories collide, but Verhoeven has a Schwarzenegger movie to make. That means Quaid\u2019s journey of self-discovery takes the form of other Schwarzenegger sci-fi/actioners of the period like Predator or The Running Man, with him shooting and punching and bludgeoning his way to the truth. It eventually puts him at the heart of the resistance in the mutant-filled Venusville area on Mars, where he finds the girl of his dreams, Melina (Rachel Ticotin), armed and ready.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81ce064b1e88dd181e188095fc9933914eb47546\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81ce064b1e88dd181e188095fc9933914eb47546/0_0_3501_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Schwarzenegger in Total Recall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from film company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Drawing from his unrivaled gallery of heavies, Verhoeven cast Ronny Cox, who had played the corporate shark \u201cDick\u201d Jones in RoboCop, as Vilos Cohaagen, the nefarious governor of the Mars Colony, and Michael Ironside, who would later play a military recruiter in Starship Troopers, as Cohaagen\u2019s sadistic right-hand man. We get only bits and pieces of Cohaagen\u2019s business on Mars, but it involves the dangerous mining of turbinium ore, an energy source with military applications, by an oppressed mutant population. The big twist of Total Recall is that Cohaagen knows Mars has the natural potential to create an atmosphere to sustain human life, but it\u2019s more profitable to control an artificial environment himself. Why should these lowly meatsacks get their oxygen for free?</p> <p>Verhoeven pushed the politics of RoboCop and Starship Troopers more to the foreground than he does in Total Recall, but he shows again how propaganda networks brand the resistance as \u201cterrorists\u201d and describe their indiscriminate slaughter as \u201c[restoring] order with minimal use of force\u201d. Total Recall suggests that colonization is an opportunity to terraform a reality that\u2019s entirely managed by the terraformers, without a scrap of land that regular people can call their own. Cohaagen is a delectable villain for Schwarzenegger to knock off, but he\u2019s not an evil genius with some generic or arbitrary plans to be unraveled. He says he\u2019s happy at his job because he gets to do whatever he wants. Controlling who gets to have air is as God-like a power as any mortal can imagine.</p> <p>Of course, Verhoeven is still making a Schwarzenegger movie, and Total Recall is one of his most purely entertaining, full of cartoonish violence, cutting-edge special effects and the types of one-liners that made Schwarzenegger a dad-joke Dirty Harry. (After shooting the duplicitous Lori in the head, Quaid deadpans, \u201cConsider that a divorce.\u201d) As Quaid makes his way to the Mars underground, the film fills the screen with memorable future-world innovations: The walk-through X-ray scanner, the automated driver-less \u201cJohnnycabs\u201d that imitate the banter of actual cab drivers, the erotic possibilities of a three-breasted mutant call girl. Those looking for a good time in a dystopic, totalitarian colony can still find it.</p> <p>Verhoeven and Hollywood would part ways a decade after Total Recall \u2013 consider Hollow Man a divorce \u2013 and he\u2019s currently on a retreat to Europe that\u2019s resulted in two great films, Black Book and Elle, that are more in line with the more modest Dutch films that put him on the map. (His new film, a lesbian nun story called Benedetta, would have probably premiered at Cannes last month were it not cancelled because of the coronavirus.) Seeing the film again is a reminder of how much American blockbusters miss an iconoclast like Verhoeven, who could manage mega-productions without losing his voice in them, and who wasn\u2019t contented by merely turning out slick product. He would prove to be irreplaceable.&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>A decade ago, the highly prized \u201cking of fish\u201d, the bluefin tuna, was taken off menus in high-end restaurants and shunned by top chefs, amid warnings by environmentalists that it was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2010/mar/19/bluefin-tuna-industry\">driven to extinction</a>. Recent assessments of eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, which can grow to the size of a small car and live for up to 40 years, have shown much healthier populations.</p> <p>But now conservationists and scientists are warning that the largest and most valuable tuna species could once again be under threat if a Japanese bluefin fishery in the eastern Atlantic Ocean is awarded an internationally recognised \u201c<a href=\"https://globalecolabelling.net/what-is-eco-labelling/\">ecolabel</a>\u201d they claim is based on flawed science.</p> <p>On Monday 1 June, an independent judge will hear evidence from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Japanese fishery and assessors for the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), to help determine whether the assessors were right to recommend the fishery receives its label.

There are currently 11 CABs, one of which is UK-based Control Union Pesca (CUP). Last year, in its <a href=\"https://cert.msc.org/FileLoader/FileLinkDownload.asmx/GetFile?encryptedKey=m1kVxySCvNnjmy0+sGiy6XJQGKAr/dTPjg4ERHbEuth7qodkjdz70LbyLiRddjhK\">preliminary report</a>, CUP decided Usufuku Honten met the criteria for MSC certification.</p> <p>Di Carlo claimed there was a \u201clack of impartiality\u201d in this process as well as what he believes is flawed science: \u201cThe MSC claims to be very rigorous in its scientific approach but here we have a case where the MSC\u2019s assessors used a number of values far below the scientific average. We know it is not a sustainable fishery but the MSC assessors are coming up with values that ensures it passes. To me, that\u2019s not telling the truth about sustainability.\u201d</p> <p>An audit of the process, carried out by a third party auditor, Assurance Services International, found CUP had assured Usufuku in 2018 that it would be the first bluefin tuna fishery to be certified, after the company had expressed concern over the French fishery also seeking approval. In its <a href=\"https://www.asi-assurance.org/s/assessment/a1P1H000002xXeNUAU/a20171219089\">report</a>, the auditor described this as one of six \u201cminor nonconformity\u201d issues, under standards around impartiality. MSC said CUP has since taken action to address the issues flagged by ASI.&nbsp;</p> <p>WWF, which co-created the now independent MSC scheme two decades ago, has objected to 17 of its certifications in total, mostly unsuccessfully, and has called on the body to reform.</p> <p>\u201cWe think the MSC is an excellent tool,\u201d Di Carlo said \u201cWe have already said clearly we haven\u2019t seen enough reform in the MSC system to be satisfied that they are meeting sustainability criteria. I would not trust all of the fisheries to be sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>Grantly Galland, an officer at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said that after years of overfishing it was premature to \u201cdeclare victory\u201d for bluefin tuna.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe most recent stock assessment for the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean was riddled with uncertainties,\u201d Galland said. \u201cThe scientists were unable to confirm whether the stock has recovered.</p> <p>\u201cWe are objecting because we think the certifying body got it wrong. They concluded ICCAT\u2019s management was a bit more robust than it was in reality.\u201d</p> <p>In a letter posted on the MSC website, Sotaro Usui, CEO of Usufuku Honten, described WWF\u2019s objection as \u201cdisappointing and unfair\u201d and accused it of taking advantage of the review to criticise MSC and ICCAT.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/22/disappearances-danger-and-death-what-is-happening-to-fishery-observers\">Disappearances, danger and death: what is happening to fishery observers?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2017, ICCAT scientists who estimate the health of the migratory bluefin tuna population were unable to say with certainty that the stock had recovered, and recommended \u201ccaution\u201d in setting quotas.</p> <p>Shana Miller, a senior officer in international fisheries conservation for the Ocean Foundation, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no dispute that the population is better off than it was 10 years ago.

The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries</strong></h2> <p>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</p> <h2><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks</strong></h2> <p>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</p> <h2><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases</strong></h2> <p>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases</strong></h2> <p>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday he road a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload</strong></h2> <p>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the epicentre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>North Korea to reopen schools </strong></h2> <p>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation. The new school term \u2013 initially scheduled to start in early April \u2013 has been repeatedly postponed, although some universities and high schools were allowed to resume classes in mid-April.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>The Queen makes first public appearance</strong></h2> <p>In the UK, the Queen has been pictured riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2013 her first public appearance since the lockdown began. Windsor is said to be the Queen\u2019s favourite royal residence and she has been photographed over the weekend riding one of her ponies, a 14-year-old Fell pony called Balmoral Fern. The 94-year-old regularly rides in the grounds of Windsor and has been a passionate horse lover and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses throughout her reign.</p> <h2><strong>Spain to extend lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said the country needs 15 more days of lockdown until 21 June \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and that he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. \u201cWe have almost achieved what we set out to do,\u201d Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically.</p> <h2><strong>Bangladesh lifts lockdown</strong></h2> <p>Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections. \u201cThe lockdown has been lifted and we are heading almost towards our regular life,\u201d health department spokeswoman Nasima Sultana said, calling on those returning to work to wear masks and observe social distancing. It comes as Bangladesh \u2013 which on Friday took an emergency pandemic loan from the International Monetary Fund \u2013 reported its biggest daily jump in infections Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths.</p>",

I hope that Americans notice Beijing\u2019s restraint.\u201d</p> <p>The Twitter account of the Global Times has also published clips from the US protests, including one of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/globaltimesnews/status/1266931564631318528\">police vehicle ramming into protesters</a> in New York city.

They are my first audience. My peers and colleagues, to be recognised by them, people who are closer to my home, is more significant.\u201d</p> <p>A total of 178 New Zealanders were on the list, including former All Blacks captain Kieran Read, novelist Elizabeth Knox, and M\u0101ori linguist \u0100ni P\u0101tene Gazala Wainu.</p> <p>Waititi\u2019s Nazi-era satire Jojo Rabbit won the Oscar for best-adapted screenplay at the 2020 Academy Awards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/taika-waititi-first-maori-oscars-2020-indigenous-new-zealand\">'We can make it here': Taika Waititi urges on Indigenous talent after Oscar win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In his acceptance speech Waititi thanked his mother for giving him the book on which the film was based and dedicated the award to \u201call the indigenous kids in the world who want to do art and write and dance and who are the original storytellers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can make it here\u201d he said.</p> <p>Last month, Waititi was announced as the director of the new Star Wars film, after impressing Hollywood with his big-action blockbuster, Thor: Ragnarok.</p> <p>After winning the Oscar prime minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand was \u201cincredibly proud of him\u201d, while Christine Leunens, the author of the novel that Waititi adapted to win his Oscar, said she watched all of Waititi\u2019s work before agreeing to let him adapt it.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something very distinctive, tragedy and humour [about his work],\u201d she said. \u201cLiving in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand\">New Zealand</a>, I find that the M\u0101ori have such a wonderful sense of humour, and such warmth and such inclusivity.\u201d</p> <p>Ella Henry, a commentator on the M\u0101ori screen industry based at Auckland University of Technology, said although Jojo Rabbit was not on its face an Indigenous tale, Waititi had told it in a way that was in keeping with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/m-ori\">M\u0101ori</a> storytelling traditions.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the way Taika\u2019s films have evolved to use humour and pathos to express trauma, he elevates survival by bringing that pathos and humour and resilience to those stories,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I would say it\u2019s a very M\u0101ori story.\u201d</p> <p>In New Zealand, Waititi is beloved, and his earlier films, namely Boy and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, are the highest-grossing New Zealand films of all time.</p> <p>In 2017 he was named New Zealander of the year, and used the opportunity to front a series of anti-racism campaigns.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/jun/15/thor-ragnarok-director-taika-waititi-takes-on-racism-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/6jeqc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"3573543\"            data-video-name=\"Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi takes on racism \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5941da51e4b0d5ab311e7d5d\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2017/06/15/150617taiki_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2017/06/15/150617taiki.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2017/06/15/150617taiki_V3.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/jun/15/thor-ragnarok-director-taika-waititi-takes-on-racism-video\">Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi takes on racism</a></figcaption> </figure>"
