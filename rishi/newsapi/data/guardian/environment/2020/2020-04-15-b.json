Closed airports, bonded labour, or other forms of unbreakable employment contracts, and little access to funds, have made it close to impossible for those who want to leave to do so.</p> \n  <p>In <strong>Lebanon</strong>, where an economic meltdown had already shattered household incomes before the coronavirus lockdown, both Amnesty International and the International Labour Organisation fear that many domestic workers are no longer being paid. There are concerns that with families confined to homes, workers have been forced into more intensive and dangerous work, facing obsessive demands to clean inside the house, and dangerous xenophobia on rare trips outside. </p> \n  <p>Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s Middle East and North Africa regional director, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As one of the most marginalised groups in Lebanon, the government needs to clearly warn that it will prosecute employers who exploit or abuse migrant domestic workers. It should also ensure they are granted access to health care during the pandemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In Lebanon, the 250,000 strong migrant workforce consists primarily of domestic workers who usually live in the homes of their employers.</p> \n  <p>In the Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC), where foreign workers make up 90% of the population of the <strong>UAE</strong>, 60% in <strong>Kuwait</strong>, 50% in <strong>Bahrain</strong>, and 33% in <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, large numbers of migrant workers are instead housed in labor camps. Many have been stood down since the corona outbreak, and can neither depart for their home countries or leave their compounds. Social distancing is very difficult and access to advanced health care is often limited.</p> \n  <p>While official coronavirus numbers in the Gulf states are relatively low, compared with the region\u2019s most seriously affected state, Iran, there are concerns that migrant camps are dangerous incubators for the virus, and are not adequately checked by authorities who give precedence to citizens and expatriate residents.</p> \n  <p>When the region\u2019s airports eventually open, potentially by the end of Ramadan in late May, some GCC countries are expecting many laid off skilled and unskilled workers \u2013 who can still afford to leave \u2013 to attempt to do so. In the meantime, several million others face what NGOs believe to be a heightened risk and increasing uncertainty</p> \n  <p>The coronavirus crisis has crippled employment across the Gulf and could spell ruin for construction, retail and other sectors. The upshot could threaten the very future of migrant labour in all countries \u2013 and in turn threaten the viability of some of the world\u2019s richest economies.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:31:17.639Z\">at 12.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e96ea678f082a2cd32a7171\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T11:07:42.335Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>EU</strong>\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has slammed the US decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF/status/1250356625803599875\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Deeply regret US decision to suspend funding to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WHO</a>.

WHAT A GOAL!!! Holland 2-1 Argentina (Bergkamp, 90 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Diego Maradona against England in 1986 multiplied by Marco Van Basten against USSR in 1988 divided by Michael Owen against Argentina this week = this goal, one of the greatest that will ever be scored in any football match at any time in any place. It all started with an Argentina attack, Lopez\u2019s cross from the left drifting over the unmarked Batistuta in the middle. With no other Argentina players about, Frank De Boer was able to stroll out of defence, bringing the ball up towards the halfway line. Assessing his options, he looked to release the ball, before spotting Bergkamp making a run in the corner of his eye. With that wand of a left foot, he hit a magnificent 70-yard diagonal pass to Bergkamp, who had advanced into the right side of Argentina\u2018s area. He let the ball drop over his shoulder and what followed were three touches of genius, each with his right foot. The first saw him pluck the ball out of the sky with astonishing elan. With Ayala marking him tightly, he poked the ball inside to wrongfoot the defender, who goes screeching off into the distance like Road Runner, and then, with his third, with greatness beckoning, he toepoked the ball as it bounced up into the top left corner of Roa\u2019s goal from the right corner of the six-yard box. The stadium erupts, Argentina collapse and Bergkamp races away to be mobbed by jubilant, disbelieving team-mates.. He did it so many times for Arsenal last season, but this is the winner <em>in the last minute of a World Cup quarter-final against Argentina</em>. Barring a minor miracle, Holland are through. It\u2019s Rob Rensenbrink in reverse!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a96a430a83c4bf550d25fbcc4453811715be6a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a96a430a83c4bf550d25fbcc4453811715be6a7/0_0_1864_1374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland\u2019s Dennis Bergkamp controls the ball before firing in the winning goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"737\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Bergkamp controls the ball ...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"467dfab6aec6610b752ccf896222886a4e659388\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/467dfab6aec6610b752ccf896222886a4e659388/0_359_5904_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dennis Bergkamp fire the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa for the Netherland\u2019s last minute winner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Bergkamp fire the ball past Argentina goalkeeper Carlos Roa for the Netherland\u2019s last minute winner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VI-Images via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d503badbcde6390417e0a292e7d643a301f3f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d503badbcde6390417e0a292e7d643a301f3f6/0_0_2000_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland\u2019s Dennis Bergkamp, left, is congratulated by teammates Wim Jonk, right, and Marc Overmars after scoring the winning goal against Argentina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bergkamp, left, is congratulated by teammates Wim Jonk, right, and Marc Overmars after scoring his stupendous goal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo Mazal\u00e1n/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:33:31.948Z\">at 9.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e976de18f08ea7431f43924\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T20:26:56.857Z\">9.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">OH MY WORD!

For such a brainy player, it\u2019s as if someone just flicked off the switch in his head. In the great pantheon of moronic red cards, this one\u2019s right up there. It was just so pointless. With Argentina pressing, Ortega had the ball on the right of Holland\u2019s area. Faced by Stam, he cut inside, before swiftly jinking outside. Stam hung out his left leg, which was the cue for Ortega to take a preposterous tumble. The referee blew - momentarily it seemed for a penalty - but he then flashed a yellow card in Ortega\u2019s direction. Van der Sar then ran over to remonstrate with the Argentinian for diving. Ortega was still on the floor but having been provoked, he bounced up, intentionally crashing the top of his head against Van der Sar\u2019s chin in the process. Right in front of the referee, who immediately shows him red. Ortega has lost Argentina their numerical advantage.

A penny for David Beckham\u2019s thoughts right now. To be fair, Holland can have few complaints about this and it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s come from another Argentina counterattack. Numan might blame Davids for the referee\u2019s decision though, because just before he made his tackle, the midfielder had clattered into Veron on the halfway line. Advantage was played, but once Simeone got to the loose ball, Numan chopped him down, his victim flying through the air and writhing in agony. He\u2019s probably not hurt but it was a cynical foul, despite Holland\u2019s protestations.

With Holland\u2019s defence completely exposed, a superb first touch with his right foot takes him into the area and past Frank De Boer. His second isn\u2019t too shabby either, an absolute piledriver with his left foot that screams on to the inside of the left post. That was all the more remarkable because Batistuta has been completely invisible, but he only needs one moment to change the game (although he needs another one now).

Lopez raced down the left flank, tracked by Stam, whose desperate last-ditch slide tackle was not enough to prevent the striker from bursting through on goal. In fairness, the intervention at least made the angle tighter, so instead Lopez was forced to poke the ball through Van der Sar\u2019s legs and into the six-yard box, where Frank De Boer had got himself into a crucial position. Batistuta was lurking behind him and would have scored.

Holland 1-1 Argentina (Lopez, 17 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The reprieve was only temporary. Just seconds after that Veron chance, Argentina draw level with the slickest of goals. Remarkably it came straight from Holland\u2019s clearance and this has been the game in microcosm, with the Dutch simply incapable of holding on to possession for more than a few seconds. Van der Sar hoofed the ball to Bergkamp on the halfway line but he was swiftly engulfed by three Argentina defenders. Veron was left unattended in space between the midfield and the back four, and had ample time to slide a simple through ball straight down the middle for Lopez, beating an awful offside trap with ease. What followed was one of the coolest goals you could hope to see, Lopez opening up his body to put the ball on to his left, before producing roughly 73 dummies and feints in a bid to dupe Van der Sar. Just as one was about to scream at him to shoot, Van der Sar, simply unable to wait any longer, took the bait and collapsed on his backside, and Lopez, looking like a man supping a cocktail on the beach, rolled the ball through his legs and into the net. That was so infuriatingly calm - he could have done anything he wanted once Van der Sar had fallen - and it could only have been more insulting if he\u2019d walked the ball to the line, stooped down to his knees and nodded it in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"856b5ea148f168957c1a3b57be217f837d3a2a6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/856b5ea148f168957c1a3b57be217f837d3a2a6e/0_0_1988_1462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Lopez, left,slots the ball past Netherland\u2019s goalie Edwin Van Der Sar to get Argentina back on level terms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudio Lopez, left,slots the ball past Netherland\u2019s goalie Edwin Van Der Sar to get Argentina back on level terms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08b8135c56f5462538ebbb868fce1637829d0269\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b8135c56f5462538ebbb868fce1637829d0269/0_0_2416_1448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Lopez celebrates his goal with Gabriel Batistuta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lopez celebrates his goal with Gabriel Batistuta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T19:20:30.245Z\">at 8.20pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9759a08f08cf571cdb1b5d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T19:02:14.502Z\">8.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>17 min:</strong> Whoops! Holland are their own worst enemies at times. Davids wonks a wayward pass to Numan out on the left. It\u2019s so firmly hit and in his attempt to keep the ball from going out for a throw-in, Numan miscontrols the ball into the path of Ortega, who\u2019s on it in a flash. Suddenly realising that Ortega has a free run at his defence, Numan cynically brings him down, conceding a free-kick and injuring himself in the process. As he lies prone on the turf, a yellow card is flashed in his direction. How heartless. He\u2019s hurt himself, in case you didn\u2019t see! From the resulting free-kick, Argentina nearly find the equaliser. It was taken short and the sublime Veron loped ominously into Dutch territory. Upon reaching the area, he played a lovely wall pass with Batistuta, Holland carved open like a biology student dissecting a frog, but was just unable to reach the return on the stretch and Van der Sar plunges on the ball.

Holland 1-0 Argentina (Kluivert, 12 min)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Holland take the lead against the run of play! And what a superb, clinical strike it is too. They\u2019ve been well below par in midfield, but Ronald De Boer has taken the game by the scruff of the neck here, dodging Almeyda\u2019s challenge and gliding supremely through a centre as soft as mushy peas. Twenty-five yards from goal, it looked for a moment as if he would shoot, but instead he disguised his intentions and chipped a delightful pass towards Bergkamp, who had edged to the left. Showing typically wonderful awareness, Bergkamp sliced open Argentina\u2019s dizzy defence, coaxing the ball into the path of Kluivert with a gorgeously cushioned header, allowing the striker to stroll through the middle and coolly clip the ball over the onrushing Roa from 15 yards out. That was a sublime team goal. And yet so crushingly simple.

Backing the Dutch will feel normal. </p> <p> <strong>Which way will it go, though?</strong> All hype aside, Argentina are fortunate to be in this quarter-final at England\u2019s expense. After all Glenn Hoddle\u2019s side were magnificent on Tuesday night. Only, nothing went their way, Paul Scholes missing a glorious chance to make it 3-1 and lights out in the first half, David Beckham having a wee meltdown, Diego Simeone being Diego Simeone, Alan Shearer foolishly elbowing Carlos Roa as Sol Campbell \u2018scored\u2019, a curiously-placed divot denying Michael Owen when he went on another of those engrossing runs of his, a blatant handball in the area by Jose Chamot going unpunished during extra-time, David Seaman somehow letting in Roberto Ayala\u2019s atrocious penalty in the shoot-out and Kevin Keegan predicting that David Batty would score his. Oh Kevin! You make your own luck and all that, but still. If that match proved anything, it is that Argentina, for all their exquisite talent, are very much there for the taking.</p> <p><strong>Then again, Argentina might say the same about Holland. </strong>And with good reason too. The Dutch drew two of their group games, only managing a win against South Korea, and were then downright shabby against Yugoslavia in their second-round match. With the match poised at 1-1 in the second half, they were let off the hook when Predrag Mijatovic plonked a penalty against the bar, before Edgar Davids won it for Holland with a hit-and-hope effort from the edge of the area in the last minute. Again, there\u2019s terrific flair in that side, but it\u2019s yet to really catch fire. But what do I know? Both sides are still unbeaten. It\u2019s bound to be tight.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T17:49:49.661Z\">at 6.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e9650638f08213494be6c88\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T10:37:46.987Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> <strong>The mere mention of R</strong><strong>ob </strong><strong>R</strong><strong>ensenbrink</strong><strong> should be enough to send a shiver down the spine of any Holland fan old enough to remember the 1978 World Cup.</strong> Rensenbrink, of course, is the byword for footballing misfortune, the man who stared glory in the face and blinked. He was the man who could have altered history, who could have defined a generation. Instead he was the man who missed \u2013 in the last minute of the World Cup final. </p> <p> With the match against the hosts Argentina delicately poised at 1-1, Holland had a free-kick just inside their half. From the centre circle, it was sent long into the Argentina area by Ruud Krol. The defending was poor, Argentina\u2019s right-back allowing the pass to bounce through to Rensenbrink, whose run had gone unnoticed by his supposed marker. The attacker reached the ball before the goalkeeper Ubaldo Fillol, stuck out his left leg and poked a shot goalwards from the left side of the six-yard box. <br>  As he made contact with the ball, Fillol clattered into him, which would hardly have made a difference to Rensenbrink if his effort had rolled into the empty goal. How could it have? With the last kick of the match, he would have won the World Cup for Holland, for the first time, four years after they had lost in the final to West Germany. But the ball took one final bounce on its journey and that was all it required to alter the shot\u2019s trajectory, kick fatefully away from goal, on to the near post and back out into the area. It was hacked clear, and moments later the full-time whistle blew. </p> <p>Needless to say, Argentina scored twice in extra-time to secure a 3-1 victory. They, not Holland, had their name on the trophy for the first time. Eight years later, they won it for the second time. Twenty years later, Holland have not gone closer. Today they have a chance for revenge, an opportunity to reach the last four at Argentina\u2019s expense. Will Rensenbrink be watching?</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 3.30pm BST, 4.30pm in Marseille (or 7.45pm BST in the year 2020).</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T17:49:51.736Z\">at 6.49pm BST</time></p>  </div>",
  "<p>Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Or perhaps not. Matt Hancock had been expected to give the previous day\u2019s Downing Street press briefing but got pulled in favour of Rishi Sunak, following the publication of Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s report suggesting GDP was set to tank by 35% over the next three months.</p> <p>So you might have thought the health secretary would have used the extra 24 hours to fine-tune his announcements on social care.</p> <p>Not so much. Over the past few weeks Hancock has been one of the few cabinet ministers to look even vaguely competent, but today he let his department down, he let his country down, but worst of all he let himself down. And there\u2019s nothing worse than a Tigger who lets a Tigger down. The best he can do now is go home to watch a replay of his press conference and cry himself to sleep.</p> <p>Hancock began by praising 99-year-old Captain Tom Moore for raising \u00a37m for the NHS by walking round his garden. As well he might. For that \u00a37m probably represents roughly the sum of what the Conservative government has taken out of the NHS each day over the past 10 years or so. Certainly, the legendary Chris Grayling has managed to waste twice that in a single visit to the despatch box in the Commons.</p> <p>Thereafter it was all downhill. I am here to tell you the next steps in our social care package, Tigger bounced. Which was news to everyone as up till now even the first baby steps had been kept a closely guarded secret.</p> <p>When Boris Johnson became prime minister he assured the country he had a social care package ready and waiting to go. To go precisely nowhere, as ever since we\u2019ve heard precisely zilch. Nada. Social care for the elderly still appeared to be the government\u2019s lowest priority even during a coronavirus pandemic that disproportionately affected old people.</p> <p>So here was the deal. More workers and care home residents would be getting tested and there would definitely be more personal protection equipment available. Though starting from a baseline of near zero this wasn\u2019t quite the earth-shattering announcement that Hancock had led everyone to expect.</p> <p>But luckily, Tigger was planning on saving the best till last. Because he knew that what social care workers really wanted wasn\u2019t testing, PPE, more money or a home secretary who dismissed them all as low-skilled. It was a shiny new green badge, saying CARE, that he was proud to model.</p> <p>A badge. A sodding badge. Even the writers of the TV series The Thick of It wouldn\u2019t have dared come up with something as crass as this. Especially as it was a badge that had already been launched a year previously to the general indifference of everyone in the care home sector.</p> <p>This was Tigger\u2019s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire moment. He was sorry that no social care workers had won the jackpot this week; the producers were withholding the \u00a31m top prize because they suspected cheating had taken place as there had been a lot of background coughing during the recording of the show \u2013 but as a gesture of goodwill, and to make sure no one went home empty-handed, he would be giving every contestant a badge. And a Tigger cuddly toy.</p> <p>Hard to believe, but the badges really were the high point of the entire 45-minute briefing. Hancock looked genuinely dismayed that the media weren\u2019t quite as wowed by them as he was \u2013 Fighting Corona, a Badge at a Time \u2013 and he rather went into meltdown during the question and answer session.</p> <p>First he made out that the reason testing levels had actually fallen in recent days was because NHS workers were far too busy sunning themselves in the park during the Easter Bank holiday weekend and they couldn\u2019t be arsed to come in for a test. You can only imagine the conversations that must have been taking place all over the UK. \u201cShall I go and get the test for which I\u2019ve been begging for for weeks? Or shall I just not bother and top up the tan?\u201d</p> <p>Hancock also appeared to be clueless as to why the government was seemingly unable to give even a hint of what criteria it would be using when considering a possible relaxation of the lockdown rules. There was no strategy to have a strategy. The best he could come up with was that different governments were at different stages of preparation so it would be wrong to make any comparisons.</p> <p>The strong implication was that our government was still at the \u201ccompletely hopeless\u201d stage of preparation so we shouldn\u2019t be holding our breath for any news any time soon. This is a decision that appears to be well above everyone\u2019s pay grade, including the prime minister\u2019s.</p> <p>Even that wasn\u2019t the nadir. Matt can\u2019t go out to meet the press without having a plan of action involving numbers. Last time out he had a five-pillar plan, almost none of which had yet to happen. So why should anyone believe a word he said now?</p> <p>Laura Hughes, of the Financial Times, gently pointed out that he had promised 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April and we were still down in the 16,000s. Which made the 100,000 promise in two weeks\u2019 time look totally unrealistic.</p> <p>Here Tigger lost the plot. It was all a big lie. A conspiracy. He had never said 25,000 tests by the middle of April. FAKE NEWS. He had said 25,000 by the end of April which he had then increased to 100K. So just wait and see. He believed he could fly. He believed he could touch the sky. Mystic Tigger. Unaccountably, Hughes was the only journalist not granted a supplementary question in which she could nail the inconsistencies in his memory. Instead, he bounced out the room, kissing the badge in triumph. And there we all were thinking it was the bear who had the little brain.</p>",

  "<p>Few are lucky enough to go wild these days. Under lockdown our horizons have shrunk. Beloved nature reserves and glorious national parks must wait until the quarantine is lifted. Yet the wild <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/climate-crisis-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-nature-bounces-back-but-for-how-long\" title=\"\">is coming to us</a>. In Essex, deer roam a housing estate. In Llandudno, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/31/llandudno-goats-herd-running-riot-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">goats</a> charge down the streets. In San Francisco, coyotes prowl the Golden Gate Bridge. Inner-city residents may see a bird of prey overhead for the first time, or notice flashes of colour from butterflies which usually shun their gardens.</p> <p>Animals are moving into the spaces that humans have vacated, and we are unusually receptive to their arrival. When days seem so indistinct, the appearance of a new bird in a backyard suddenly seizes our attention. A morning walk through a quiet park may have replaced a commute on a packed bus. Birdsong is clearer now that the traffic has hushed.</p> <p>With quieter roads, the death toll of hedgehogs and other creatures is expected to fall. Grass verges, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-may-prove-boost-for-uks-bees-and-rare-wildflowers\" title=\"\">left uncut</a>, will provide a home for wildflowers and a breeding ground for bugs and insects. Heavy machinery is parked up, leaving nests undisturbed.</p> <p>Animal appearances seem to bring such joy to human hearts that some tales of returning wildlife \u2013 such as dolphins in Venice\u2019s canals \u2013 have been <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/animals/2020/03/fake-animal-news-abounds-social-media-coronavirus-upends-life\" title=\"\">exaggerated or confected</a>. Nor is all the real news good. Much work to protect wildlife has slowed or stopped due to social distancing measures, and the nature conservation sector, often strapped for cash, is under increased pressure. In developing countries, the absence of tourism and monitoring groups may give a free rein to loggers and poachers who will see no more need to obey quarantine rules than any other laws. People already living close to the edge may be <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/natures-comeback-no-the-coronavirus-pandemic-threatens-the-worlds-wildlife-136209\" title=\"\">forced to exploit nature</a> to survive as their work disappears.</p> <p>Not all towns and cities are as blessed with parks as many British ones are, and even in the UK, the quantity and quality of green space varies widely. We have never thought so much about it: the lockdown is a painful reminder that people in deprived areas and those from BAME backgrounds have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-park-closures-hit-bame-and-poor-londoners-most\" title=\"\">less access to public parks</a> as well as being less likely to have private gardens. This is not inevitable. Both pocket parks and larger expanses can improve the mental and physical health of their users. Access to nature should not be a privilege.</p> <p>When the pandemic is finally over, wildlife may vanish as fast as it emerged \u2013 and we may not really notice. The need to feed families may soon subsume broader considerations of wellbeing. Yet this strange and frightening interlude is reminding us that there may be better ways to arrange our lives. Plans for the UK\u2019s great national parks were <a href=\"https://www.nationalparks.uk/students/whatisanationalpark/history\" title=\"\">drawn up</a> in the depths of the second world war as part of Labour\u2019s plan for reconstruction. This crisis should stir a similar endeavour to bring urban green space to all.</p>",

At his press conference Hancock wrongly said that he had not set a target of 25,000 tests a day. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9739718f08ea7431f436e0#block-5e9739718f08ea7431f436e0\"> 5.45pm.)</a> But he did recommit himself to the 100,000 tests a day target by the end of the month - despite widespread doubts as to whether this is achievable. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And as we build capacity further over this month and then beyond to that 100,000 a day target by the end of this month we\u2019ll expand further those who are eligible for tests - all as part of the plan to get a hold of this virus and make sure that we support the key public services that we need as this moment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He published <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/879639/covid-19-adult-social-care-action-plan.pdf\">a coronavirus action plan for adult social care (pdf)</a>. </strong>The plans involve increased testing and improved access to protective equipment for people in care homes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said that the daily death toll from coronavirus in the UK was reaching its peak.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On the issue of the peak, our view is that it is probably reaching the peak overall. That is what the flattening shows. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Whitty also said the number of deaths might go up tomorrow. That was because, after every weekend, there was a dip in reported deaths at the weekend, and for two days afterwards, followed by a rise. And he said deaths would continue at a high rate for a while. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At the moment we are not yet at the point where we can say confidently and safely this is now past the peak and we can start thinking very much about the next phases. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty also said that the experts did not know yet what the reproduction number for coronavirus was (the rate at which it is transmitted). It was between 0.5 and 1, he said. (One is the point where one new person gets infected for every person with the virus etc. The reproduction number has to be below 1 for the epidemic to be on the decline.) He said the better the understanding of this number, the more easy it would be for the experts to anticipate what would happen next.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said that he wanted to change hospital rules so that \u201cwherever possible\u201d people will be given the \u201cchance to say goodbye\u201d to loved ones dying with coronavirus.</strong> He said that \u201cwanting to be with someone you love at the end of their life is one of the deepest human instincts\u201d, and that he wept at reports of 13-year-old Ismail dying without a parent at his bedside. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m pleased to say that working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we are introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection while wherever possible giving people\u2019s closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he was promoting a badge for carers, so that they would be able to receive the same public respect as NHS staff.</strong> Displaying the badge, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identify themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo.

Forsyth writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The thinking is that a delay would not solve the fundamental policy problems and that a deal is either possible or not. Another factor, I understand, is that the government worries about the cost of any extension. There is concern that extending could drag the UK into the arguments about who pays for the various EU schemes designed to protect the European economy and preserve the eurozone. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Government sources are saying this afternoon that, when <strong>David Frost</strong>, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser, spoke to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, earlier today about the next round of the Brexit talks, he stressed that the UK does not intend to ask for an extension.</p> \n  <p>However, Forsyth also floats the possibility that the EU could request an extension, not the UK. \u201cIf the EU did ask for more time, it would put the government in a difficult position,\u201d Forsyth writes. \u201cRejecting the request would sit ill with the idea that the UK wants to be a good neighbour to the EU.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under the withdrawal agreement the transition can be extended for one year or two years if both sides agree before 1 July. However the EU (Withdrawal Agreement) Act says UK ministers are not allowed to agree to an extension. For the government to allow an extension, it would have to pass legislation amending the act.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6465dfff6072345ec033aab8908f1c27f2e8344/473_20_2298_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Frost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Frost.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e971f448f0895d83068e8f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T15:13:42.826Z\">4.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Turning away from coronavirus for a moment, <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary, has used <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2020/04/unite-behind-keir-starmer-to-cleanse-labours-shame/\">an article for LabourList</a> to urge Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, to publish a redacted version of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/labour-leader-sir-kier-starmer-orders-urgent-review-leaked-antisemitism-report\">the internal party report leaked at the weekend</a> that showed how hostile some party officials were to Jeremy Corbyn.

There is real hope for the reef,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cRRAP is all about finding ways to help protect the reef from the effects of future warming and to prevent the kinds of bleaching that we have seen going on and to help damaged reefs recover.\u201d</p> <p>He said the research effort was \u201cat the forefront of any science being done anywhere in the world\u201d.</p> <p>Some methods previously discussed as having potential to lower temperatures on reefs during heat stress events \u2013 including using pumps and fans to circulate cooler deeper water onto shallower corals \u2013 have been ruled out for further research.</p> <p>But other concepts have been approved for further research in programs that will run over the next five to 10 years. They include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Shading reefs by brightening clouds using nano-sized ocean salt crystals, or creating fog and mist over smaller reef areas</p></li> <li><p>Using \u201cmicro-bubbles\u201d, ultra-thin natural films and farmed algae to reduce light over smaller areas</p></li> <li><p>Stabilising and enhancing damaged reef structures with mesh, frames, concrete shapes and 3D printed forms that could recreate the complexity of natural reefs</p></li> <li><p>Dispersing slicks of natural and tank-raised coral larvae onto reefs</p></li> <li><p>Breeding corals that are naturally more heat tolerant and then using their larvae in mass dispersal</p></li> </ul> <p>David Mead, the AIMS director of strategic development, who helped coordinate the feasibility study, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe outcome we want is to retain the fundamental resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>\u201cThis is to progress a broad range of ideas and some will get eliminated along the way.\u201d</p> <p>On cloud brightening, Mead explained the concept was to spray nano-sized droplets of salt water to increase the reflective capabilities of clouds.</p> <p>While the effect was \u201csubtle\u201d he said over a period of weeks initial modelling suggested it could keep water temperatures below the threshold where corals bleached.</p> <p>\u201cIt sounds scary and we need to do a lot of detailed studies on any downstream impacts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The feasibility study also estimated the annual cost of the 43 different concepts being researched. While the costs seemed high \u2013 cloud brightening, for example, would cost an estimated $158m a year \u2013 Mead said the benefits were also very large.</p> <p>The study modelled likely benefits from deploying the interventions, which ranged from $10.7bn over 60 years to figures in the hundreds of billions.</p> <p>But the cost benefits from deploying the measures were dependent on future greenhouse gas emissions and diminished as temperatures went higher.</p> <p>Hardisty said the study had shown it was \u201ctechnically feasible to act at scale\u201d but he said \u201cit\u2019s going to be a combination of measures applied at different scales and in different areas that will work together to achieve real success.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cIf we can get the science right and intervene on the reef at scale to prevent this kind of damage and build that resilience, then the benefits for Australia environmentally, socially and economically, especially for reef communities, is going to be in the tens of billions of dollars.\u201d</p> <p>Anna Marsden, managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, said the feasibility study had shown that 71% of the Australian public supported large-scale efforts to help reefs adapt.</p>",

  "<p>The financial markets think the worst is over. Share prices have largely been rising for the past week (although on <a href=\"https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/prices-and-markets/stocks/indices/summary/summary-indices-chart.html?index=ASX\">Tuesday they went down</a>) on the basis that some countries are starting to lift the lockdown restrictions imposed to limit the Covid-19 pandemic. Amid sighs of relief all round on Wall Street, the hope is that it will soon be business as usual.</p> <p>In one sense, it\u2019s not an unreasonable thought because the virulence of this particular strain of the coronavirus could not have been predicted. It was what economists call an exogenous shock: something that has a big impact, but comes from outside the system itself.</p> <p>So, the argument goes, when the International Monetary Fund <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\">says</a> that the global economy is going to suffer its worst year since the Great Depression or the UK\u2019s Office for Budget Responsibility pencils in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">slump</a> unmatched for three centuries, that has absolutely nothing to do with the way the world economy is organised or run. Covid-19 does not mean the end of globalisation: it is a freak of nature, that\u2019s all.</p> <p>The view that nothing fundamental will change as a result of the twin health and economic emergencies may be right. There was, after all, much talk of how global capitalism was going to be fundamentally reformed after the banking crisis of 2008, but that\u2019s all it turned out to be: talk.</p> <p>In retrospect, the big lesson to be learned from 2008 was that the global economic system was operating on terrifyingly thin margins. Banks were taking ever-bigger bets on products they didn\u2019t really understand but had very little capital in reserve to cover any losses. There was virtually no slack in the system and this almost proved fatal when the bets went spectacularly wrong.</p> <p>The same applies now, only on a much bigger scale. The financial system may perhaps be more resilient than it was in 2008 but the global economy as a whole operates with the scantiest of safety buffers and with no margin for error. And that\u2019s true from top to bottom: from the ultra-low interest rates that have been keeping the global economy afloat for the past decade to the scramble to find intensive-care beds in the NHS. When politicians say that the fundamentals of the economy are sound, they could not be more wrong.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the real picture. The past 30 years have seen global markets \u2013 especially global financial markets \u2013 increase in both size and scope. Long and complicated supply chains have been constructed: goods moving backwards and forwards across borders in the pursuit of efficiency gains; hot money flowing into emerging markets looking for high returns and flowing out again just as quickly at the first sign of trouble.</p> <p>The development of stronger global institutions might have acted to constrain some of the excesses of transnational capital but not since the 1930s has multilateral cooperation been so lacking. The only effective form of international coordination comes from central banks, which ensure that money is cheap and plentiful. Any attempt to raise interest rates to what would once have been considered more normal levels is met by stock market panic and is quickly reversed.</p> <p>But this is not just a big-picture story. The reason the UK government has been pumping so much money into the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/uk-triples-coronavirus-response-fund-for-nhs-and-public-services\">health service</a>, into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">wage subsidies</a>, into support for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-support-package-for-uk-self-employed-how-does-it-work\">self-employed</a> and for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-promises-to-guarantee-330bn-loans-to-business\">small businesses</a> is that they were all only just managing before the crisis broke.</p> <p>The weakest decade for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/09/uk-pay-growth-budget-resolution-foundation\">real-wage growth</a> since the 19th century meant that millions of workers are only one payday away from penury. For most, self-employment is a daily struggle to make enough to live on. Small businesses, such as family-run restaurants, operate on wafer-thin margins. For them, the cost of taking out an emergency government-backed loan (assuming they could get one) would wipe out their profits for the next two years.</p> <p>What this amounts to is a world clinging on by its fingertips, even in what passes for the \u201cgood times\u201d. Anybody who seriously believes that there are no lessons to be learned from what has happened globally since China warned the World Health Organization on New Year\u2019s Eve that it might have a problem on its hands is living in a bubble. It would be an act of supreme folly to write off 2020 as an aberration and assume that everything can return to normal.</p> <p>Some changes look inevitable. Companies will shorten their supply chains as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Extra money will have to be found for health systems so that they can operate with more spare capacity. Covid-19 has exposed the risks of a country such as Britain running down its domestic manufacturing base and relying so heavily on financial services. Investment bankers are surplus to requirements when the country is short of testing kits and PPE.</p> <p>Other reforms look tougher. There is a need for a stronger international system to both manage the fight against the pandemic and minimise the economic damage it has caused. No country can operate a go-it-alone approach to Covid-19, despite what Donald Trump might think.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/15/watchdog-identifies-sectors-hit-hardest-by-covid-19-in-britain\">Watchdog identifies sectors hit hardest by Covid-19 in Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, the shock from the banking crisis was not big enough to effect real change. This one might be different, and not simply because people are losing their lives in such numbers. Avowedly free-market governments like the UK\u2019s have not gone a long way to nationalising their labour markets because they have had a Damascene conversion to socialism: they have done so because of the inherently fragile nature of their economies. The best argument those pressing for capital controls, wealth taxes and \u2013 like me \u2013 a green new deal, is that they will make the world more resilient in the next time of crisis. Because, as things stand, there will be a next time.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</p>",

Agendas for the negotiating sessions have not yet been published, but are expected to cover the 11 key topics of post-Brexit talks, including trade, security policy and fisheries.</p> <p>During the video call, Frost told Barnier the UK did not intend to seek an extension to the 11-month transition period, which ends on 31 December 2020.</p> <p>Yet EU diplomats are increasingly convinced that London will ask for an extension, as the fallout from coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\">hammers the global economy</a> and consumes political energy across Europe.</p> <p>Any decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/extend-brexit-transition-by-years-over-coronavirus-uk-told\">extend the transition must be agreed</a> by both sides by 1 July and would require a deal on new payments into the EU budget. The transition period \u2013 which keeps the UK in the EU single market and customs union without voting rights \u2013 can be prolonged for up to two years, but only once.</p> <p>As the clock ticks down, EU diplomats are dismayed the UK has failed to produce a draft legal text on fisheries, despite a goal to agree on fishing rights covering 100 shared species by 1 July.</p> <p>The absence of a UK text is perceived as an attempt by the British to gain the upper hand by attempting to delay difficult issues until the last minute.

That means the 27 EU member states, who will make the ultimate decision on the terms of the future relationship, are relying on analysis and summaries from Barnier and his negotiating team, rather than the original documents.</p> <p>The commission has <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/200318-draft-agreement-gen.pdf\">published its 440-page draft legal text online</a>, reflecting its longstanding Brexit transparency policy \u2013 and the reality that documents rarely remain secret for long in Brussels.</p>",
  "<p>The EU has urged member states to coordinate closely as they ease their coronavirus lockdowns, while the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that all transitional steps back to normal life must be taken cautiously and evaluated carefully.</p> <p>As the number of Covid-19 cases passed 2m worldwide on Wednesday, with more than 80,000 deaths in Europe, countries including Austria, Denmark and the Czech Republic have all made small-scale moves to lift some restrictions.</p> <p>Spain and Italy, the worst affected EU nations, have renewed their lockdowns but begun allowing some non-essential workers back to work, while France has said it will start easing restrictions from 11 May. </p> <p>Germany, which on Wednesday announced its highest daily death tally but its lowest ever increase in new cases, will partially reopen schools from 4 May, at first for children in their final years of primary or secondary school, with smaller shops as well as bookshops, bike stores and car dealerships, to open from the following Monday.</p> <p>Anxious to avoid the chaos that ensued when EU governments began imposing individual measures to contain the pandemic, the European commission said lifting restrictions would \u201cunavoidably lead to a corresponding increase in new cases\u201d.</p> <p>The commission said in its roadmap that all action should be gradual and coordinated, stressing that any other approach risked \u201cnegative effects for all member states\u201d and could lead to political frictions.</p> <p>In its latest strategy update, the WHO advised a wait of at least two weeks to evaluate the impact of any changes before easing restrictions again, stressing that the world stood at a \u201cpivotal juncture\u201d in the pandemic and \u201cspeed, scale and equity must be the guiding principles\u201d when deciding what measures are necessary.</p> <p>Social distancing should be maintained and there should be no general return to work, the commission recommended in its paper, and limits should be considered on the number of customers and pupils allowed in shops and classrooms.</p> <p>Elderly people must be protected for longer, while restaurants, bars and cinemas could reopen with restricted opening hours and limits on customer numbers. Bans on mass gatherings like festivals and concerts should be among the last to be lifted.</p> <p>The commission also said it could be a year before a vaccine was widely available and urged a massive increase in testing, performed in the same way across the bloc. Data collection, including through apps on mobile phones, could reduce the risk of further transmission but should be voluntary, it said.</p> <p>According to the Johns Hopkins university tracker, the coronavirus has infected nearly 2,000,100 people and killed 128,000 around the globe. More than one third of humanity is living under some form of lockdown restrictions.</p> <p>In countries where the outbreak has passed or is near its peak, leaders are wrestling with difficult decisions over lifting containment measures to jump-start economies and avert crippling recession, while still avoiding a second wave of infections.</p> <p>Italy has allowed bookshops, laundries, stationers and children\u2019s clothing stores to re-open on Tuesday - although many decided to stay shut - while Spain allowed work to restart in some factories and construction sites, and Denmark reopened its schools.</p> <p>Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, now firmly established as the heart of the global crisis after revising its death toll sharply upwards to more than 10,000 people, also urged a cautious and deliberative approach to reviving the economy, warning that moving too quickly could create an opportunity for the coronavirus to resurface.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot allow that,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cWe get one chance to get it right. I think we have to be smart about doing it in stages, making sure that we can confirm that we\u2019re containing the disease more and more, getting it back to where it was a month or two ago, before we start to open up a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere, people braced for several more weeks of restrictions. Japan on Wednesday urged its citizens to stay at home as media cited an unpublished health ministry projection suggesting as many as 400,000 could die without mitigation and 850,000 could end up needing ventilators.</p> <p>Japan has so far recorded more than 9,000 infections amid an accelerating infection rate in recent weeks, particularly in Tokyo. The government has declared an emergency in Tokyo and six other areas including Osaka, and a goal to cut interactions between people by 70% \u2013 although there are no fines or penalties.</p> <p>Meanwhile the virus is slowly taking hold in Africa, with 15,000 cases and 800 deaths continent-wide as fears mount over growing hunger and possible social unrest. \u201cA lockdown is unenforceable and unsustainable across much of Africa,\u201d said Jakkie Cilliers of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) in Pretoria, South Africa.</p> <p>\u201cYou are trying to do something that is not possible, and you are condemning people to a choice between starving and getting sick,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for 10 people living in a tin shack... to not go outside for three weeks.\u201d</p> <p>In South Korea, meanwhile, more than 17 million people wore masks and disposable gloves to vote in parliamentary elections \u2013 the highest turnout in nearly three decades despite the coronavirus, with another 11.8 million casting their ballots early.</p> <p>South Korea has been widely praised for its success in using mass testing and contact tracing to contain the spread of the virus, and to hold the elections as scheduled, officials and health authorities carefully prepared safeguards to reduce the risk.</p> <p>In the US, which on Tuesday counted a record of 2,228 victims over the past 24 hours, Donald Trump sparked global outrage <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/against-humanity-trump-condemned-for-who-funding-freeze\">by announcing that Washington would halt payments to the WHO</a> amounting to about $400m last year.</p>",

  "<p>The thunder of road traffic is likely to drive away bats, according to a study, which found vehicle noise caused bat activity to decrease by two-thirds.</p> <p>While environmental assessments of new roads focus on the danger of habitat fragmentation, or bats colliding with traffic, the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749119365546?via%3Dihub\">first ever controlled field experiment</a> to investigate the impact of vehicle noise suggests noise pollution could be highly damaging.</p> <p>Researchers played noise recorded from the A38 dual carriageway in Devon, with a \u201cdusk average\u201d of 26 vehicles passing per minute, in locations where different bat species flew and fed. The wild bats, including pipistrelle species, Daubenton\u2019s and the greater horseshoe bat, were monitored with bat detectors placed beside, and 20 metres away, from the recorded noise.</p> <p>Ultrasonic sounds from vehicles were found to impede some bat species\u2019 high-frequency echo-location calls, which they use to find insect prey such as moths. But more significant was that most bat species sought to avoid audible traffic noise.</p> <p>\u201cJust like us, bats are likely to find audible road noise an irritation, something they would prefer to avoid rather than it jamming their echo-location,\u201d said Fiona Matthews, professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex and co-author of the paper in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749119365546?via%3Dihub\">Environmental Pollution</a>.</p> <p>Matthews said the effect of ordinary traffic noise on bats meant that the adverse impact of new roads on bat populations was likely to be more far-reaching than realised.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThis is important, as it means we could expect to see negative effects continue at a considerable distance from the road. We know that lower frequency road noise travels well beyond 50 metres \u2013 the scale at which ecological impact assessments are conducted.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Henry Schofield, from <a href=\"https://www.vwt.org.uk/\">Vincent Wildlife Trust</a>, which jointly funded the research, said: \u201cWe have become increasingly aware that bat species face barriers in the landscape that impede their ability to access suitable feeding areas and reduce their chances of survival. Along with habitat fragmentation and artificial lighting at night, this research has added road noise to the list of anthropogenic factors reducing habitat quality for these protected species.\u201d</p> <p>While studies have shown that traffic noise causes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/29/wildlife.animalbehaviour\">birds to sing more loudly</a> and be less responsive to alarm calls, there has been little research on how it affects other wildlife.</p> <p>The relatively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">silent streets</a> during the coronavirus crisis appear to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/climate-crisis-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-nature-bounces-back-but-for-how-long\">a boon</a> for many species, and the researchers are hoping to study the impact of much-reduced traffic levels on bats.</p> <p>According to lead author, Domhnall Finch, the findings suggest formal ecological impact assessments should be required whenever there are significant increases in traffic flows, not only when new roads are built.</p>",

The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Processor</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.</p>\n    <p>Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>RAM</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.</p>\n    <p>Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it's difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Storage</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.</p>\n    <p>That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google's Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Software updates</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.</p>\n    <p>Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple's support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google's three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Battery life</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Battery life varies drastically between devices, and \"all-day battery\" often doesn't mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you're out in the evening.</p>\n    <p>Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Camera</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.</p>\n    <p>Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.</p>\n    <p>As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.</p>\n    <p>Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.</p>\n    <p>The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn't necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Other things to consider</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Wireless charging:</b>&nbsp;convenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn't come in the box</p>\n    <p><b>Durability:</b>&nbsp;generally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragile</p>\n    <p><b>Resale value:</b>&nbsp;iPhones hold their value better than most others</p>\n    <p><b>OLED versus LCD:</b> OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaper</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe new iPhone SE has the potential to drive the next wave of adoption of Apple\u2019s popular smartphone brand.

History shows that iPhone purchasers seem happy to pay the premium Apple\u2019s products command, but the current global economic uncertainty risks challenging this assumption.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In a matter of weeks, coronavirus has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\">shuttered the global economy</a> and placed capitalism in intensive care. Many thinkers have expressed hope that it will usher in a more humane economic system; others warn that the pandemic heralds a darker future of techno-totalitarian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/mass-electronic-surveillance-uk-app-lockdown-download\">state surveillance</a>.</p> <p>The dated cliches from the pages of 1984 are no longer a reliable guide to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/apr/14/not-even-wall-street-titans-know-the-true-cost-of-the-coronavirus-crisis\">what is to come</a>. And today\u2019s capitalism is stronger \u2013 and weirder \u2013 than its critics imagine. Not only do its numerous problems present new avenues for profit-making, they also boost its legitimacy \u2013 since the only salvation will be dispensed by the likes of Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The worse its crises, the stronger its defences: this is definitely not how capitalism ends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have spent a month debating how tech might threaten our privacy \u2013 but that is not the greatest danger to democracy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the critics of capitalism are right to see Covid-19 as a vindication of their warnings. It has revealed the bankruptcy of neoliberal dogmas of privatisation and deregulation \u2013 showing what happens when hospitals are run for profit and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/coronavirus-crisis-tories-cuts\">austerity slashes public services</a>. But capitalism does not survive by neoliberalism alone: the latter merely plays the role of the bad cop, insisting, in the words of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s famous dictum, that \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d.</p> <p>The good cop in this drama is the ideology of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/deepfakes-facebook-silicon-valley-responsibility\">solutionism</a>\u201d, which has transcended its origins in Silicon Valley and now shapes the thinking of our ruling elites. In its simplest form, it holds that because there is no alternative (or time or funding), the best we can do is to apply digital plasters to the damage. Solutionists deploy technology to avoid politics; they advocate \u201cpost-ideological\u201d measures that keep the wheels of global capitalism turning.</p> <p>After decades of neoliberal policy, solutionism has become the default response to so many political problems. Why would a government invest in rebuilding crumbling public transport systems, for example, when it could simply use big data to craft personalised incentives for passengers to discourage journeys at peak times? As the architect of one such programme in Chicago said a few years ago, \u201cSupply-side solutions [like] building more transit lines \u2026 are quite expensive.\u201d Instead, \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is looking at ways that data can manage the demand side ... by helping residents understand the better time to travel.\u201d</p> <p>The two ideologies have an intimate relationship. Neoliberalism aspires to reshape the world according to blueprints dating from the cold war: more competition and less solidarity, more creative destruction and less government planning, more market dependence and less welfare. The demise of communism made this task easier \u2013 but the rise of digital technology has actually presented a new obstacle.</p> <p>How so? While big data and artificial intelligence don\u2019t naturally favour non-market activities, they do make it easier to imagine a post-neoliberal world \u2013 where production is automated and technology underpins universal healthcare and education for all: a world where abundance is shared, not appropriated.</p> <p>This is precisely where solutionism steps in. If neoliberalism is a proactive ideology, solutionism is a reactive one: it disarms, disables and discards any political alternatives. Neoliberalism shrinks public budgets; solutionism shrinks public imagination. The solutionist mandate is to convince the public that the only legitimate use of digital technologies is to disrupt and revolutionise everything but the central institution of modern life \u2013 the market.</p> <p>The world is currently enthralled by solutionist tech \u2013 from a Polish app that requires coronavirus patients to regularly take selfies to prove they are indoors, to China\u2019s colour-coded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/chinas-coronavirus-health-code-apps-raise-concerns-over-privacy\">smartphone health-rating programme</a>, which tracks who is allowed to leave the house. Governments have turned to companies such as Amazon and Palantir for infrastructure and data modelling, while Google and Apple have joined forces to enable \u201cprivacy-preserving\u201d data-tracing solutions. And once countries enter the recovery phase, the tech industry will gladly lend its technocratic expertise to the clean-up. Italy has already put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/spain-relaxes-lockdown-as-daily-coronavirus-death-toll-falls-to-517\">Vittorio Colao</a>, the former CEO of Vodafone, in charge of leading its post-crisis task force.</p> <p>In fact, we can see two distinct strands of solutionism in government responses to the pandemic. \u201cProgressive solutionists\u201d believe that timely, app-based exposure to the right information could make people behave in the public interest. This is the logic of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/why-is-the-government-relying-on-nudge-theory-to-tackle-coronavirus\">nudging</a>\u201d, which shaped the UK\u2019s disastrous initial response to the crisis. \u201cPunitive solutionists\u201d, by contrast, want to use digital capitalism\u2019s vast surveillance infrastructure to curb our daily activities and punish any transgressions.</p> <p>We have now spent a month debating how these technologies might threaten our privacy \u2013 but that is not the greatest danger to our democracies. The real risk is that this crisis will entrench the solutionist toolkit as the default option for addressing all other existential problems \u2013 from inequality to climate change. After all, it is much easier to deploy solutionist tech to influence individual behaviour than it is to ask difficult political questions about the root causes of these crises.</p> <p>But the solutionist responses to this disaster will only hasten the diminishment of our public imagination \u2013 and make it more difficult to imagine a world without the tech giants dominating our social and political infrastructure.</p> <p>We are all solutionists now. When our lives are at stake, abstract promises of political emancipation are less reassuring than the promise of an app that tells you when it\u2019s safe to leave your house. The real question is whether we will still be solutionists tomorrow.</p> <p>Solutionism and neoliberalism are so resilient not because their underlying ideas are so good but because those ideas have profoundly reshaped institutions, including governments. The worst is still to come: the pandemic will supercharge the solutionist state, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-civil-liberties-authoritarian-measures\">9/11 did for the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-civil-liberties-authoritarian-measures\">surveillance </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-civil-liberties-authoritarian-measures\">state</a>, creating an excuse to fill the political vacuum with anti-democratic practices, this time in the name of innovation rather than just security.</p> <p>One function of the solutionist state is to discourage software developers, hackers and aspiring entrepreneurs from experimenting with alternative forms of social organisation. That the future belongs to start-ups is not a fact of nature but a policy outcome. As a result, more subversive tech-driven endeavours that could boost non-market, solidarity-based economies die off at the prototype stage. There\u2019s a reason why we haven\u2019t seen another Wikipedia in two decades now.</p> <p>A \u201cpost-solutionist\u201d politics should begin by smashing the artificial binary between the agile start-up and the inefficient government that limits our political horizons today. Our question should not be which ideology \u2013 social democracy or neoliberalism \u2013 can harness and tame the forces of competition better, but rather: what institutions do we need to harness the new forms of social coordination and innovation afforded by digital technologies?</p> <p>Today\u2019s debate on the right technological response to Covid-19 feels so stifled precisely because no such post-solutionist politics is in sight. It revolves around the trade-offs between privacy and public health on the one hand, and around the need to promote innovation by start-ups on the other. Why are there no other options? Isn\u2019t it because we have let digital platforms and telecom operators treat our entire digital universe as their fiefdom?</p> <p>They run it with just one goal in mind: keep the micro-targeting going, and micro-payments flowing. As a result, little thought has gone into building digital technologies that would produce macro-level anonymous insights about collective behaviour of non-consumers. The digital platforms of today are the sites of individualised consumption, not of mutual assistance and solidarity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/mass-electronic-surveillance-uk-app-lockdown-download\">Has coronavirus opened the door to mass electronic surveillance in the UK?  | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While they can be used for non-market purposes, today\u2019s digital platforms make a poor foundation for a political order open to actors other than consumers, start-ups and entrepreneurs.

The feast of solutionism unleashed by Covid-19 reveals the extreme dependence of the actually existing democracies on the undemocratic exercise of private power by technology platforms. Our first order of business should be to chart a post-solutionist path \u2013 one that gives the public sovereignty over digital platforms.</p> <p>Otherwise, complaining about China\u2019s authoritarian but effective response to Covid-19 is not only pathetic but also hypocritical: there are many varieties of techno-authoritarianism in our future, and the neoliberal version doesn\u2019t look much more appealing than the alternative.</p> <p>\u2022 Evgeny Morozov is a Guardian US columnist</p>",
  "<h2><strong>What is the World Health Organi</strong><strong>zation\u2019s remit?</strong></h2> \n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded as the UN global health body in 1948 in the aftermath of the second world war with a mandate to <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/what-we-do\">promote global health,</a> protect against infectious disease and to serve the vulnerable. It was inspired by the international sanitary conferences of the 19th century set up to combat communicable diseases such as cholera, yellow fever and plague.</p> \n<p>Its current programme envisages expanding universal healthcare to a billion more people, protecting another billion from health emergencies and providing a further billion people with better health and wellbeing. </p> \n<h2><strong>What does that involve?</strong></h2> \n<p>In practical terms, the badly underfunded WHO acts as a clearing house for investigation, data and technical recommendations on emerging disease threats such as the coronavirus and Ebola. It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.</p> \n<p>While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world with its more resilient healthcare systems, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes. Its 2018-9 budget was $4.8bn, which became $5.7bn when emergencies were included.</p> \n<h2><strong>Why is the WHO under fire from Trump?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump has presented the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/against-humanity-trump-condemned-for-who-funding-freeze\">freezing of US funding to the WHO</a> as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. But the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/10/trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus-state-department-usaid-budget-cuts/\">when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution,</a> about $400m annually, by half as part of $3bn cuts to US global health funding across the board.</p> \n<p>The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b547ab04-9a4f-4f6c-8c17-c8f14a632205\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6JIA8iBw1-w?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The allegation by Trump and his supporters that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. WHO technical guidance issued in early January <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\">was warning of the risk of human-to-human transmission</a> and the organisation declared coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern a day before Trump announced his partial ban on flights from China.</p> \n<p>Instead, it appears Trump is following a familiar playbook: finding others to blame amid his own handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has included calling it the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">Chinese virus</a>\u201d, blaming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/donald-trump-obama-administration-coronavirus\">the previous Obama administration</a> and taking aim <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/trump-states-governors-clashes\">at state governors</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>How does the WHO\u2019s performance in the coronavirus crisis compare </strong><strong>with the </strong><strong>2014</strong><strong>-15 Ebola outbreak?</strong></h2> \n<p>The WHO, under the then-director general, Margaret Chan, was savaged from all sides for responding so slowly to an Ebola outbreak that began in a remote forested part of Guinea where the borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia were virtually non-existent. By the time the WHO acted, six months late, it had reached the dense cities.</p> \n<p>The fallout for the WHO was serious and undermined its credibility. US critics suggested scrapping it and setting up a new global public health body, although the idea did not take off and President Obama did not support it. An independent report commissioned by Chan said the WHO\u2019s funding was inadequate and governments had not increased their contributions in years. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the current director general, and all other candidates for the role after Chan stood down pledged to reform its governance and funding.</p> \n<p>Most health experts agree the organisation under Tedros has performed much better over the coronavirus.</p> \n<h2><br><strong>How big an impact will the US funding cuts have?</strong></h2> \n<p>While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 the potential for a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.</p> \n<p>Even before the Trump announcement, the organisation was looking at potential cuts to already underfunded programming. Such impacts could be felt in programmes already complicated by the coronavirus, such as vaccination for communicable diseases and in building up early warning systems and resilience to deal with diseases such as Ebola in African countries.</p> \n<p>Devi Sridhar, the chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, called Trump\u2019s decision extremely problematic, noting that the WHO was leading efforts to help developing countries fight the spread of Covid-19. \u201cThis is the agency that\u2019s looking out for other countries and leading efforts to stop the pandemic. This is exactly the time when they need more funding, not less,\u201d she said.</p> \n<h2><strong>What other impacts will there be?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump\u2019s assault on the reliability of WHO data and early warning systems, in pursuit of his own agenda against China, threatens its leadership role. While global health diplomacy is a balancing act when dealing with countries like China, which have a poor record on freedom of speech, transparency and human rights, the information provided to health officials by the WHO is designed to be scientifically and clinically useful in the control of the spread of disease.</p>",
  "<p>In a parody of self-destructive nationalism, Donald Trump yesterday decided that an unprecedented global health emergency was the perfect time to withdraw American funding from the organization whose job it is to fight global health emergencies. His decision to suspend contributions to the World Health Organization is an extraordinary act of moral abdication and international vandalism at a time when the world desperately needs to find means of working together to combat an unprecedented global threat.</p> <p>Global problems require global solutions. Covid-19 does not respect borders \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-travel-ban-europe-us#maincontent\">even closed ones</a> \u2013 and its continued transmission anywhere poses a threat to health everywhere. We are still in phase one of the crisis, in which countries are mostly focused on containing the initial wave of domestic outbreaks. If these efforts are not to be in vain, then intensive international cooperation will be needed to get expertise and resources to where they are needed most \u2013 especially as the disease takes root in impoverished countries in the Global South.</p> <p>The WHO is the only organization in the world with the network and expertise to effectively perform this task. And there is ample precedent of the organization delivering results even amid geopolitical conflict and tension between the world\u2019s leading countries. In the 1960s and 70s, the United States and the Soviet Union <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-7709.2009.00850.x\">worked together</a> to provide the WHO with the resources it needed to eradicate smallpox, a disease which <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070921235036/http:/www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/smallpox/en/\">afflicted</a> about 50 million people a year in the early 1950s and no longer threatened humankind at all by 1977.</p> <p>Smallpox was a very different disease to Covid-19, but the world\u2019s successful eradication of it demonstrates what international organizations can accomplish when governments decide to put geopolitical squabbles and petty politics aside to solve a problem which threatens them all. For the richest country in the world to decide to use its power, wealth and influence to actively undermine rather than lavishly support such efforts today is an act of moral blindness with few parallels in recent American diplomacy.</p> <p>A lack of international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19 risks repeating the mistakes of the Great Depression, when many countries put up trade barriers in a misguided attempt to protect their own economies. The result was even greater economic devastation for everyone, and a collapse in international trust. By comparison, the international response to the global financial crisis of 2008 was coordinated and effective, lessening the impact of the economic shock. Today the world faces an economic crisis which may rival the Great Depression and a global health crisis unlike anything in the history of modern globalization, and its response looks much more like the 1930s than 2008.</p> <p>The fact that Trump\u2019s decisions are being driven so transparently by his petty domestic political problems suggests that the world shouldn\u2019t look to Washington to provide responsible leadership any time soon. Trump now blames the WHO for being insufficiently critical of China\u2019s early response to the virus, but he himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">praised</a> China\u2019s cooperation with the WHO and separately <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243407157321560071\">lauded</a> Beijing as recently as the end of March \u2013 before he started taking <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/13/net-approval-for-trumps-handling-of-coronavirus-dips-underwater/\">a battering</a> in polls and needed ways to explain away his own failures.

If governments decide to myopically focus purely on their own domestic situations instead \u2013 even perhaps hoarding medical supplies to hedge against future waves of the infection \u2013 then they risk allowing a tragedy to unfold elsewhere and ultimately return to their own shores.</p> <p>History teaches us that the sort of collective action needed to address this crisis will not just emerge spontaneously \u2013 it must be built painfully, step by step, by countries who trust one another and are able to look beyond their own immediate interests. It often requires a trailblazer who is willing to take the risk of acting first and counting on bringing others along. Previous presidents realized that with America\u2019s great power came great responsibility, and often rose to moments like these \u2013 or at least attempted to.</p> <p>Yet the current occupant of the White House has spent his entire term torching international partnerships, trashing America\u2019s reputation as a responsible and trustworthy actor in world affairs, and making it clear he has no interest in accepting the responsibility which comes from being the leader of the richest and most influential country in the world. He wants to make America \u201cgreat\u201d but his conception of greatness would be unrecognizable to every other post-war president. If international vandalism is all he has to offer in the face of the greatest global crisis of a generation, then the world we inhabit might soon be, too.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andy Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University in The Netherlands</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>The Arcadia Group, which owns brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, is estimated to have cancelled in excess of \u00a3100m of existing clothing orders worldwide from suppliers in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries as the global garment sector faces ruin.</p> <p>According to data from the Bangladesh Garments and Manufacturing Association (BGMEA), the Arcadia Group has cancelled \u00a39m of orders in Bangladesh alone.</p> <p>The Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), a labour rights group based in the US, says it believes that the Arcadia Group will have cancelled \u201cwell in excess of \u00a3100m\u201d of orders across its global supply chains. It currently sources only 5% of its clothing orders from Bangaldeshi suppliers.</p> <p>\u2018\u201cThe effect of order cancellations like Arcadia\u2019s, which we estimate will cost Arcadia\u2019s suppliers more than \u00a3100m, is to force suppliers into bankruptcy and to leaves thousands of workers without income,\u201d says Scott Nova, executive editor at WRC.</p> <p>The Arcadia Group declined to comment.</p> <p>WRC also estimated that collectively global brands have potentially cancelled in excess of \u00a320bn of orders worldwide not just from Bangladesh but from other major garment producing countries such as Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.</p> <p>In recent weeks, retailers have been accused of abandoning their garment workforce at a time when many lower-income countries will struggle to provide economic safety nets for millions of low-paid workers.</p> <p>Last week Arcadia Group, owned by Sir Philip Green, rowed back on the wholesale cancellation of all existing orders. In a letter to suppliers seen by the Guardian, it said that although it had a \u201ccontractual right\u201d to cancel orders that had already been shipped, it would accept those that were in transit on 17 March at a 30% discount. However, all other orders, including clothing that had already been made but had not been shipped, will be cancelled.

  "<p>New York City has revised its Covid-19 death toll sharply upwards to more than 10,000 people, with the city now firmly established as being at the heart of the global coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>The soaring death toll has been fueled by the adding of 3,778 people who were not tested for Covid-19 but are presumed to have died from it. Last week, Bill de Blasio, New York City\u2019s mayor, admitted that the official death toll was probably too low as many people who died at home or in nursing homes were not included.</p> <p>Adding these likely Covid-19 deaths to bring the official death toll to 10,367 will help New York City determine the scope of the crisis, according to Oxiris Barbot, the city\u2019s health commissioner. \u201cBehind every death is a friend, a family member, a loved one,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are focused on ensuring that every New Yorker who died because of Covid-19 gets counted.\u201d</p> <p>New York City\u2019s per-capita death toll from the virus now outstrips Italy, with its total number of deaths only slightly behind that of the UK. The coronavirus has been a punishing blow to the city, where a procession of wailing ambulance sirens is often the only sound on eerily quiet streets.</p> <p>A rising body count has left morgues filled, funeral homes inundated and crematoriums working around the clock. Dozens of refrigerated trucks for the dead have been parked outside overwhelmed city hospitals.</p> <p>\u201cWe have gone through hell,\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cWe have to be honest and acknowledge the full impact on families that this disease has had \u2026 we could not confirm it at the time because there was no time to test but we thought that was probably what it was and we should be fair and honest about the bigger picture.\u201d</p> <p>De Blasio, who wants city schools closed for the rest of the academic year, said New York City needed widespread testing to allow a gradual reopening of schools, businesses and other places where people gather in numbers.</p> <p>The failure of the federal government to roll out enough tests has meant New York is now producing its own tests, with a goal of assessing 50,000 people a week by the start of May, the mayor said.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of other places are going to have to do the same thing if the US government does not get its act together,\u201d De Blasio said.</p> <p>Donald Trump has suggested an early loosening of social distancing restrictions, first aiming a rollback for Easter and now for May, but public health experts and many state governors have warned against this, fearing it would prompt a huge spike in infections.</p> <p>A rigorous system of testing for new cases and tracing of infected people is seen as a crucial element of reopening the US economy, which is hemorrhaging millions of jobs. The federal government has increased testing rates but there has been no plan put forward to facilitate the widespread testing required.</p> <p>In California, Governor Gavin Newsom said that he will look to set out a plan to gradually reopen the state but said he will be guided by \u201cscience and public health, not politics\u201d and would not put a timeframe on when a sense of normalcy will return.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no light switch here, it\u2019s more like a dimmer,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI know you want the timeline, but we can\u2019t get ahead of ourselves and dream of regretting.

  "<p>\u201cPsychologically, it\u2019s been terrible,\u201d says Dr Dawn Liu, of the coronavirus wedding ban. \u201cThere\u2019s been this absolute sense of insecurity, this threat that in the middle of a pandemic I might be told to leave my fiance and take a flight, which is really risky. That fear won\u2019t leave at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Liu, 31, from Colchester, was due to marry her fiance, Dr Angus Holford, 33, on 6 April 2020. Both are academics at the University of Essex: they met on OkCupid in June 2018, before getting engaged the following year. Liu is originally from Singapore, and is on a tier 2 working visa, which grants her the right to live and work in the UK. Under normal circumstances, Liu would have had plenty of time after her April wedding to apply for a spouse visa before her tier 2 visa expired on 14 July, enabling her to continue working and living in the UK.</p> \n<p>But after the government banned weddings on 23 March, to prevent the coronavirus pandemic spreading, Liu and Holford have found themselves in immigration limbo. They are one of a number of couples due to marry before the coronavirus wedding ban now wondering how the pandemic will affect their immigration status.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"65a9450f-4bec-4555-bdb0-c829a2782b42\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What do the restrictions involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</li>\n     <li>One form of exercise a day \u2013 for example a run, walk, or cycle \u2013 alone or with members of your household</li>\n     <li>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</li>\n     <li>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

However, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/uk-family-visa/partner-spouse\">engaged people</a> are not allowed to work on spouse visas \u2013 meaning that Liu would have to quit her job if she wanted to remain in the UK with Holford. And although the government has automatically extended all visas that were set to expire during the lockdown to 31 May, this won\u2019t help Liu, as her visa expires after then. \u201cIt\u2019s a circular legal nightmare for us,\u201d says Holford. </p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cUnder the immigration rules, anyone on a work visa who was granted leave for more than six months can apply to switch to a spouse visa. This applies to married and unmarried couples and was the case before the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d They did not comment on whether visas would be extended beyond the 31 May cut-off date, to help people such as Liu.</p> \n<p>Unlike funerals, which are still ongoing during the coronavirus lockdown, albeit with only immediate family in attendance, all wedding ceremonies and registrations have been put on hold.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we register the wedding in a room with just the registrar, the couple, and two witnesses, all spread out in a room according to social distancing guidelines?\u201d says Holford.</p> \n<p>The coronavirus wedding lockdown is also proving unexpectedly costly for the couples reliant on marriage to certify their immigration status. \u201cIt\u2019s going to rack up,\u201d says Mariah Abshire, who is 23 and lives in Arnos Grove.</p> \n<p>Abshire, a US citizen, was meant to marry her fiance, Nikolay Bogdev, 24, on 23 March \u2013 the day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. The day before her wedding, Abshire got a phone call from her registry office. \u201cIt was insane!\u201d she says. \u201cWe got the call literally the day before saying they were locking it down.\u201d She has asked her council when she may be able to reschedule her wedding, but they weren\u2019t able to give her any concrete answers.</p> \n<p>Abshire\u2019s fiance visa is set to expire on 9 July. She will most likely have to apply to extend it, at the cost of \u00a31,033. \u201cIt would be great if they did waive those extension charges, given that this is unprecedented,\u201d says Abshire. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a personal issue that came up needing us to get an extension. It\u2019s a national emergency that is causing everything to go on pause. It would be helpful if the government could bear that in mind, seeing as how people aren\u2019t allowed to work here legally and need to fork out a lot of money to stay here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Holford and Liu would like further clarity from the government on whether they will automatically extend visas beyond the 31 May date, particularly now that it looks likely the coronavirus lockdown will go on for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government has been vague in their promises,\u201d says immigration specialist Robin Molyneux of Global Immigration Solutions. \u201cThey should look at having a provision for anyone whose visa was expiring by a later date being automatically extended, without fees being payable for people having to renew them.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Liu and Holford are waiting anxiously. \u201cWhen we tell people that we had to postpone our wedding, they say: \u2018Oh it must be hard to have to postpone!\u2019 But they are missing the point. Marriage isn\u2019t just a piece of paper. So much depends on it. Weddings are important for legal reasons.\u201d</p>",

One of these solutions, among others, will be the refund. We have never said that we wouldn\u2019t offer them.\u201d They said they were \u201cwaiting for the legal framework on this matter to be defined\u201d across Spanish, Catalonian and European law before announcing details, adding: \u201cWe must be patient and wait for these new extraordinary measures to be fully defined. If we were to do so before, we would not be guaranteeing legal certainty either for our festival or for our ticketholders. We want to inform our buyers on the basis of certainties, not speculations.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, prolonged the country\u2019s state of emergency \u2013 which prohibits events, as well as restricting business activity and people travelling to work in non-essential sectors such as entertainment \u2013 until 26 April. S\u00e1nchez suggested that he seek a further extension until 10 May (the head of the regional government in Catalonia said he would not comply with any premature easing of the lockdown anyway).</p> <p>Dice, a ticketing partner, confirmed in emails that \u201cemergency regulations have been introduced in Spain to help promoters through this crisis\u201d, with the government suspending the need for festivals to process refunds until the state of alarm is over. This could be another month, or more. In previous Spanish cases, a clause has sometimes been invoked that has allowed insurers to modify contracts rather than see them cancelled \u2013 though as Primavera address in their statement, Spanish legislation is newly in flux during Covid-19 and it is not clear if they could find themselves in a similar situation.

The festival, which had already moved from May to July, is thus back in the red zone.

  "<p>There was a dramatic melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet in the summer of 2019, researchers have confirmed, in a study that reveals the loss was largely down to a persistent zone of high pressure over the region.</p> <p>The ice sheet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/02/heatwaves-amplify-near-record-levels-of-ice-melt-in-northern-hemisphere\">melted at a near record rate in 2019</a>, and much faster than the average of previous decades. Figures have suggested that in July alone surface ice declined by 197 gigatonnes \u2013 equivalent to about 80 million Olympic swimming pools.</p> <p>Now experts have examined the level of melting in more detail, revealing what drove it. Crucially, the team note, the high pressure conditions lasted for 63 of the 92 summer days in 2019, compared with an average of just 28 days between 1981 and 2010. A similar situation was seen in 2012, a record bad year for melting of the ice sheet.</p> <p>The team say the climate models of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have not taken into account such unusual conditions. If such high pressure zones become a regular annual feature, future melting could be twice as high as currently predicted, a result that could have serious consequences for sea level rise.</p> <p>\u201cThis melt event is a good alarm signal that we urgently need to change our way of living to hold [back] global warming because it is likely that the IPCC projections could be too optimistic for [the] Arctic,\u201d said Dr Xavier Fettweis, co-author of the research from the University of Liege, adding that the atmospheric conditions were unlikely to be down to natural climatic variability and could be driven by global heating.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.the-cryosphere.net/14/1209/2020/\">Writing in the journal </a><a href=\"https://www.the-cryosphere.net/14/1209/2020/\">the Cryosphere</a>, Fettweis and his co-author Marco Tedesco from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University report how they used satellite data, climate models and global weather patterns to explore the melting of the surface of the ice sheet last year.</p> <p>Among their findings the team report that almost 96% of the ice sheet underwent melting at some time in 2019, compared with an average of just over 64% between 1981 and 2010.</p> <p>Using models, the pair also found that about 560Gt of meltwater runoff was generated in the summer of 2019. The surface mass balance, the amount of ice the sheet gained from rain and snowfall minus the amount lost through meltwater run off and evaporation, was just 54Gt a year\u2013 about 320Gt a year lower than the average across the earlier decades, and the greatest such drop on record.</p> <p>Further analysis showed the level and distribution of melting to be closely tied to a number of factors, including levels of snowfall and reflection of sunlight \u2013 known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/03/on-reflection-albedo-effect-word-of-the-week\">albedo</a> \u2013 as well as cloudiness and absorption of sunlight. All of these, they note, were influenced by the persistent high pressure zone over the ice sheet last summer.</p> <p>Dr Poul Christoffersen, a glaciologist at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, welcomed the research, noting only 2012 had a higher meltwater runoff in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, this shows that extreme melt events are becoming a lot more frequent,\u201d he said, adding that the new study showed that persistent atmospheric high pressure was an important factor, resulting in clear skies and a lack of snowfall in the south and warm, moist air being brought to northern parts of the ice sheet. \u201cIn that sense, the extreme melt years can be seen as natural events exacerbated by climate change,\u201d said Christoffersen.</p> <p>Prof Andy Shepherd from the University of Leeds said a fall in surface mass balance was concerning. \u201cIf that drops below zero, then the ice sheet is no longer viable because in every year it is losing more ice than it gains,\u201d he said, adding that that was not even counting the loss of icebergs. \u201cEven if the glaciers stopped flowing, which is not going to happen, it would mean that the ice sheet still can\u2019t survive,\u201d he said.</p>",
  "<p>What the UK is most afraid of has come from overseas, taking our jobs and making it unsafe to walk the streets. This is the opening message of a widely shared video on coronavirus that subverts racist language often directed at immigrants, showing that those who have experienced discrimination are now key workers, trying to keep people safe.</p> \n<p>The clip \u2013 which has gone viral worldwide \u2013 features UK residents, immigrants and people of foreign heritage who are medics, delivery drivers and teachers working hard amid the Covid-19 outbreak. They read a poem, penned by Darren James Smith, entitled You Clap for Me Now.</p> \n<p>The video\u2019s producer, Sachini Imbuldeniya, said: \u201cThe United Nations released a global brief to all creatives to spread messages of positivity, kindness and solidarity during these uncertain times. The brief was very open in terms of what content was created. My good friend and colleague Darren Smith wrote the poem. We both work together at Bridge Studio.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe previously interviewed my mum, a retired nurse, for an article that ran in the Sunday Times magazine about the Windrush scandal and feels very passionately about the subject, as do I. When I read the poem I knew the message needed to be spread as widely as possible, so we decided to turn it into a short and shareable video featuring a mixture of first-, second- and third-generation immigrants living in the UK.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She said the biggest restriction to making the film was the UK lockdown. \u201cI messaged lots of people on Instagram and also friends and family to see if they would be interested in taking part and each filming themselves reciting one line from the poem that I allocated to them.\u201d</p> \n<p>The video was edited by Ruben Alvarado. It features Tez Ilyas, a British standup comedian of Pakistani descent, as well as others including doctors Kiran Rahim and Mehwish Sharif.<br><br> Smith said: \u201cI only wrote a poem 10 days ago and it came together very quickly but I wrote it and showed it to Sachini Imbuldeniya and she loved it and wanted to make a film out of it. The original idea was really hers and she created the film and worked out the logistics of it and how we can film when people are in their homes. She coordinated it from there, bringing people together.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith said of first meeting Imbuldeniya, when he interviewed her mother: \u201cIt was really interesting talking to her mum about how we really valued immigrants coming over to help the NHS. Windrush was all about bringing people over to help due to labour shortage after world war two. They were doing us a huge favour as well as building a new life.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat was the background to it and then with the pandemic we are all going outside to clap for carers, which is a lovely thing. It struck me how quickly it had changed from these people being unskilled to being essential key workers and reframed how we think about them. That is brilliant, but her mum\u2019s story came to me and I thought, let\u2019s just make sure when this all ends and we emerge into a light that we don\u2019t allow the narrative to slip back to immigrants taking our jobs and xenophobic language that you read everywhere.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he realised the parallel between far-right rhetoric, \u201cthem taking our jobs and making us feel trapped\u201d, and how it was a good description of how \u201cwe feel now thanks to the virus\u201d.</p> \n<p>The poem reads: \u201cSo, it\u2019s finally happened. That thing you were afraid of. Something has come from overseas. And taken your jobs. Made it unsafe to walk the streets. Kept you trapped in your home. A dirty disease. Your proud nation gone. But not me. Or me. Or me. No you clap for me now. You cheer as I toil. Bringing food to your family. Bringing food from your soil. Propping up your hospitals. Not some foreign invader. Delivery driver. Teacher. Life saver.\u201d</p> \n<p>Imbuldeniya said: \u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t expecting it [the video] to go viral, but am so glad that it has as I feel like it\u2019s such an important message to send out. Not just for the UK, but globally. Comedian and actor Tez Ilyas has been truly amazing. He took part in the video and also shared it on all of his social channels, which helped massively.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith said they had been overwhelmed by the response, with #YouClapForMeNow trending on UK Twitter on Wednesday morning. \u201cThe great thing is the vast majority of responses have been positive and very rare for Twitter, I think. There are inevitably trolls and people poking holes in it. Some complain about turning clapping into a political football, which is not our intention,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-and-volunteering-how-can-i-help-in-the-uk\">Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?</a></p>",

  "<p>With terms such as WFH, social distancing and self-isolation now in common parlance, the Oxford English Dictionary has made an extraordinary update to include Covid-19 and words related to the pandemic in its definitive record of the English language.</p> <p>The dictionary\u2019s executive editor Bernadette Paton said that it was \u201ca rare experience for lexicographers to observe an exponential rise in usage of a single word in a very short period of time, and for that word to come overwhelmingly to dominate global discourse, even to the exclusion of most other topics\u201d. Covid-19 has done that, and has thus been added as <a href=\"https://oed.com/view/Entry/88575495\">a new entry in the OED</a>, where it is described as \u201can acute respiratory illness in humans caused by a coronavirus, which is capable of producing severe symptoms and death, esp. in the elderly and others with underlying health conditions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAs something of a departure, this update comes outside of our usual quarterly publication cycle,\u201d said Paton. \u201cBut these are extraordinary times, and OED lexicographers, who like many others are all working from home \u2026 are tracking the development of the language of the pandemic and offering a linguistic and historical context to their usage.\u201d</p> <p>The OED\u2019s analysis of more than 8bn words of online news stories found that coronavirus and Covid-19, a shortening of coronavirus disease 2019, are now dominating global discourse. While back in December, words such as Brexit, impeachment and climate dominated news, by January, coronavirus was seeing significant use alongside current affairs terms such as bushfire, koala, Iraqi, locust and assassination. By March every single word in the OED\u2019s top 20 list of <a href=\"https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/keyword/\">keywords</a> \u2013 terms used significantly more frequently that month \u2013 was related to coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cIn January, the words mainly relate to naming and describing the virus: coronavirus, SARS, virus, human-to-human, respiratory, flu-like,\u201d said the OED in an analysis. \u201cBy March, the keywords reflect the social impact of the virus, and issues surrounding the medical response: social distancing, self-isolation and self-quarantine, lockdown, non-essential (as in non-essential travel), and postpone are all especially frequent, as are PPE and ventilator.\u201d</p> <p>The OED\u2019s lexicographers have noticed a rise in the use of specialist medical terms and new acronyms, such as WFH and PPE. The first noted usage of working from home was in 1995, but Paton notes that \u201cthe abbreviation was known to very few before it became a way of life for so many of us\u201d. The abbreviation PPE, for personal protective equipment, dates back to 1977 but was \u201cformerly probably restricted to healthcare and emergency professionals\u201d.</p> <p>Social distancing, first used in 1957, \u201cwas originally an attitude rather than a physical term, referring to an aloofness or a deliberate attempt to distance oneself from others socially. Now we all understand it as keeping a physical distance between ourselves and others to avoid infection,\u201d wrote Paton.</p> <p>Previous pandemics have also given rise to new vocabulary. Usage of \u201cpestilence\u201d, or \u201ca fatal epidemic or disease\u201d, first appears in 1382, not long after the bubonic plague peaked in Europe between 1347 and 1351. The adjective \u201cself-quarantined\u201d was first used in 1878 to describe the actions of the villagers of Eyam in the 17th century, who isolated themselves to prevent the second wave of \u201cBlack Death\u201d from spreading to surrounding villages.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a consistent theme of lexicography that great social change brings great linguistic change, and that has never been truer than in this current global crisis,\u201d <a href=\"https://public.oed.com/blog/the-language-of-covid-19/\">wrote Paton</a>.</p>",

The \u201cwet\u201d part comes from sellers sloshing water on produce to keep it cool and fresh.</p> <p>While the markets may be considered unsanitary by western standards, most wet markets in China do not sell live animals other than fish in tanks, or sometimes in open pools.</p> <p>Many markets in China stopped selling live poultry after widespread avian flu outbreaks led provinces and local governments to ban such sales over the past decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1dad6060feb56439a6c9c77326f9ff0f10c9fe9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dad6060feb56439a6c9c77326f9ff0f10c9fe9c/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker in a protective suit is seen at the closed seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China 10 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wuhan South China Seafood Market was suspected to be a source for the spreading of Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darley Shen/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And while it is rare to see wildlife sold in these markets, the practice has continued in poorly regulated sites, such as the now-infamous Wuhan South China Seafood Market, which was suspected to be a primary source for spreading Covid-19 during late 2019.</p> <p>\u201cIf we really want to prevent future pandemics, we have to do a lot more than just stop live wildlife being slaughtered at markets or wild meat being sold at markets,\u201d Debbie Banks, head of the tiger campaign at the Environmental Investigation Agency, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIn some countries, wildlife is commercially harvested and commercially farmed and transported direct to restaurants, consumed at private banquets, and used in traditional medicine, so there is a need to address demand and other retail venues besides wet markets,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Using terms such as \u201cwet markets\u201d in debates on the issue also risks further stoking misconceptions and cultural prejudices, argue some.</p> <p>\u201cThis call for a ban comes from cultural differences often mixed with prejudice,\u201d Kartini Samon, a Jakarta-based campaigner with the nonprofit Grain who has studied wet markets in the region, told the Guardian. \u201cWet markets are very common and have a long history in many places in Asia.\u201d</p> <p>The Wuhan market was closed on 1 January. Authorities in China placed a temporary ban on all trade in wildlife in late January, including any trade in wildlife to be consumed for meat, to be used in traditional medicine, and for fur and other purposes.</p> <p>Further fine-tuning of the laws and regulations around the trade is ongoing. But it is the regulatory environment that allowed for such trade at the Wuhan market and the networks that supplied it that needs to be addressed, say experts, not simply the existence of the markets themselves.</p> <p>Across many countries wet markets provide an important outlet for small farmers to sell their produce, said Samon. \u201cIn a country like India or Indonesia, between 25 and 40 million people rely on wet markets and informal food vendors for their livelihoods.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a33b202a2e48da16c08caf459f696efb8d107108\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a33b202a2e48da16c08caf459f696efb8d107108/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish for sale in a market in Israel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wet\u2019 markets are found in many countries in Asia and the Middle East, and many do not sell live animals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/Weanimals</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And while markets like Wuhan\u2019s may be an outlier for their trade in live wildlife, others say that more needs to be done to address general sanitation and hygiene at wet markets.</p> <p>\u201cThat means setting standards and sticking to them and having strict enforcement measures against practices that could transmit illness and disease. [That] is more sensible than shutting them down, which won\u2019t be consistently enforceable,\u201d said Dirk Pfeiffer, chair professor at City University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences in Hong Kong.</p> <p>Pfeiffer believes that over time many wet markets will disappear in places like China due to changes in consumer preferences and convenience.</p> <p>Some supermarkets already try to replicate a \u201cmini-wet market\u201d atmosphere with a butcher available under familiar reddish lighting for shoppers to chat with about which cuts are more fresh in a way that is harder to do in larger, impersonal, brightly-lit supermarkets.</p> <p>\u201cI do think that wet markets are an issue when it comes to food safety standards and to adverse environmental impact. But that can be dealt with by regulation and raising awareness among consumers and traders,\u201d Pfeiffer said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to focus on changing the demand, because as long as that is there it will be a way for people to trade in wild animals and their products,\u201d he said.<br></p>",
  "<p>How will the Covid-19 pandemic end? According to conventional wisdom, the crisis may ease in a few months, when some of the antiviral medicines on trial succeed. In a few years\u2019 time, when a vaccine becomes available, we may eradicate the virus altogether.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s unlikely that this is how the pandemic will actually play out. Although there is every indication that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/19/prospects-treatment-coronavirus-drugs-vaccines\">treatments for coronavirus</a> may soon emerge, the mere fact of their existence is no guarantee that people will be able to access them. In fact, Covid-19 is more likely to end in the same way that every pandemic ends: treatments and vaccines will be buried in a thicket of patents \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-vaccine-big-pharma-data\">pharmaceutical companies</a> will ultimately make the decisions about who lives and who dies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-vaccine-big-pharma-data\">The race to find a coronavirus treatment has one major obstacle: big pharma  | Ara Darzi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We typically think of monopolies, where companies exert exclusive control over a commodity, as market failures that can be corrected with antitrust laws. Medical patents are the equivalent of legalised monopolies. In theory, patents are supposed to grant pharmaceutical companies a reward for investing in research and development. Crucially, they\u2019re supposed to be temporary, lasting for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/09/why-do-new-medicines-cost-so-much-and-what-can-we-do-about-it\">20 years</a>. But in practice, patenting minor tweaks to a formula can extend this term considerably, foreclosing market competition and granting pharmaceutical companies the power to set prices.</p> <p>In 1996, a treatment for HIV/Aids was <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2071936/\">brought to market</a> in the US by a clutch of pharmaceutical companies. The treatment, a combination of antiretroviral medicines, turned a virus that was a death sentence into a chronic condition. It<strong> </strong>was priced annually at \u00a36,500 per person \u2013 in most parts of the world, this price was the same in practice as having no treatment at all. It took until 2004, after millions of people had died from the illness, for India and South Africa to afford the treatment.</p> <p>Already we\u2019ve seen how medical monopolies have restricted access to coronavirus treatments. We know, for example, that health workers don\u2019t have enough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/us-blocks-face-masks-canada-n95-protection-equipment\">N95 respirator masks</a>; less well known is that 3M holds more than 400 patents for respiratory protection, severely restricting who can produce and supply them in the US. Politicians have called on <a href=\"https://eu.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/04/03/beshear-calls-3-m-release-patent-n-95-respirator-amid-pandemic/5112729002/\">3M to release its patents</a> during the pandemic so production can be increased. Amidst an acute shortage of tests for Covid-19, a French diagnostic manufacturer submitted a test kit to the US FDA for emergency approval to sell it in the country<strong>, </strong>and was <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/307741-patent-troll-sues-to-pull-covid-19-tests-off-market-over-alleged-infringement\">sued for patent infringement</a> by a subsidiary of Softbank (this was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/03/17/softbank-owned-patent-firm-backtracks-lawsuit-targeting-coronavirus/\">later withdrawn</a>).</p> <p>And most of the promising treatments for coronavirus that are being tested in clinical trials have patents attached to them. Some of these, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/japanese-flu-drug-clearly-effective-in-treating-coronavirus-says-china\">favipiravir</a>, which is used to treat influenza, and the combination of Iopinavir and ritonavir, sold under the brand name <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2020/03/23/abbvie-hiv-kaletra-generics-coronavirus-covid19/\">Kaletra</a> to treat HIV/Aids, have short-term patents in force. <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gileads-experimental-covid-19-drug-shows-promise-but-analysts-remain-cautious-2020-04-13\">Remdesivir</a>, a medicine developed for Ebola by the biotechnology company Gilead, has major patents across the world that last until 2038. Last month, Gilead rushed to secure \u201corphan drug\u201d status in the US for Remdesivir\u2019s potential use against Covid-19. Orphan status grants companies government incentives to to develop medicines for rare diseases that would otherwise be unprofitable, yet Covid-19 is quite the opposite of a rare disease. The company later <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/gilead-asks-fda-to-rescind-remdesivir-orphan-drug-tag-after-public-backlash\">backtracked</a>.</p> <p>There is every possibility that a Covid-19 vaccine will be encumbered with multiple patents.<strong> </strong>Vaccines are now a big business. Take infant mortality caused by pneumonia, for example. The two vaccines in use today are buried in a thicket of patents belonging to Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. India uses the <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/pharmaceuticals/india-grants-pfizer-patent-for-blockbuster-brand-prevenar-13/articleshow/60174991.cms?from=md\">Pfizer vaccine</a>, which retails at $250 for a full course but is available to the government at a discounted rate of \u00a38 through GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance funding. But given that demand in India runs into the tens of millions, even the subsidised cost is unaffordable, and only a small fraction of babies end up getting the vaccine. And so, 40 years after a vaccine for pneumonia was developed, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/health/pneumonia-kills-one-child-every-39-seconds-127-000-died-in-india-2018-pneumonia-cause-data-119111300489_1.html\">127,000 Indian babies</a> continue to die from it every year, while the vaccine they can\u2019t afford continues to generate \u00a34.5bn for Pfizer annually.</p> <p>It\u2019s no surprise that countries are taking pre-emptive measures to deal with monopoly control over medical treatments.<strong> </strong>Compulsory licensing of patents \u2013 a legal measure by which countries can suspend patents on a product \u2013 is gaining popularity. Last month, Chile declared that the pandemic justifies the use of compulsory licensing; others soon followed. Israel issued compulsory licenses for lopinavir and ritonavir, Ecuador approved a resolution that asks the minister of health to issue compulsory licences over all patents related to Covid-19, Canada and Germany amended their patent laws to enable the swift grant of a compulsory licence, and Brazil is in the process of amending its patent law to make compulsory licensing easier.</p> <p>These measures are useful, but they require each country to go it alone. And patents are not the only thing preventing access to coronavirus treatments. Costa Rica recently <a href=\"https://www.presidencia.go.cr/comunicados/2020/03/costa-rica-submits-proposal-for-who-to-facilitate-access-to-technologies-to-combat-covid-19/\">submitted a proposal</a> to the World Health Organization for a global Covid-19 technology pool \u2013 a place where all the necessary intellectual property, such as patents, designs, trade secrets and software could be brought together. The pool would encourage governments to share innovations and make them available globally. The Covid-19 technology pool is far from a done deal, but support for it is growing. Policymakers in the Netherlands and the UK recently threw their weight behind the idea and the director-general of the WHO welcomed Costa Rica\u2019s proposal, while UNITAID has pledged to finance it.</p> <p>Given that this is a pandemic, it may well be that no corporation can afford to wield the stick for a Covid-19 monopoly. If Covid-19 treatments were free from monopoly control, we would have a real shot at reaching everyone. If this happens \u2013 and it\u2019s still a big if \u2013 we might realise that such a pharmaceutical system is not only what we need to survive Covid-19, but also what we need to survive other diseases.</p> <p>\u2022 Achal Prabhala is a Shuttleworth Fellow and the co-ordinator of the AccessIBSA project, which campaigns for access to medicines in India, Brazil and South Africa.</p> <p>\u2022 Ellen \u2018t Hoen is the director of Medicines Law &amp; Policy, a researcher at the University Medical Centre Groningen, and a founder of the Medicines Patent Pool.</p> <p><br></p>",

Ever since the late 60s, when what was then the sole university, Haile Selassie I (now Addis Ababa University), became a hotbed of anti-government activity, student unrest has had an ethnic and sometimes violent edge. In 1967, for instance, there was a riot at the faculty of education between Tigrayan and Amhara students that went on for several days. Serious ethnic clashes took place at Bahir Dar polytechnic two years later.</p> <p>But they are becoming more frequent and more deadly. A <a href=\"https://www.cardeth.org/universities-as-contested-terrain-making-sense-of-violent-conflicts-in-ethiopian-universities/\">report</a> by the Centre for Advancement of Rights and Democracy (Card), a local NGO, documented at least nine rounds of university-based conflict since December 2017, many flaring up on more than one campus at a time.</p> <p>The unrest is partly the result of Ethiopia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/16/uneasy-peace-ethiopia-three-flags-fly-oromia-somali-states-tension-ethnic-federalism\">distinct model of ethnically-based federalism</a>, established in 1994, which has ensured the recognition of minority groups but also hardened ethnic identities. In the past two years alone, <a href=\"https://www.internal-displacement.org/countries/ethiopia\">about 3 million Ethiopians</a> have been displaced and hundreds killed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/14/shadow-falls-over-ethiopia-reforms-warnings-of-crisis-ignored-abiy-ahmed\">waves of ethnic and regional violence</a>.</p> <p>Troubles on campus are also in part a consequence of failings in the federal system. Universities, as federal institutions with mixed populations, <a href=\"https://www.atiner.gr/papers/EDU2013-0644.pdf\">are much more diverse</a> places than most schools and workplaces. But they have grown increasingly homogenous in recent years, following a shift away from the old pattern of posting students and academics to universities far from their home region.</p> <p>Today, each university is the de facto property of an ethnic group, according to Yonas Ashine, author of the Card report. Most staff and management are locals, and the leadership of student unions is drawn mostly from the indigenous ethnicity.

According to national law, all universities are expected to teach in \u201cneutral\u201d English, but many lecturers are not fluent. In universities in Oromia, in particular, teaching is often in the local language \u2013 one consequence of the failure of the federal system to promote a common tongue.</p> <p>Amara Mitiko, an economics lecturer at Wollo University, was initially sent to Wollega University in western Oromia after graduating. \u201cThe whole campus spoke only Afaan Oromo \u2013 few people spoke English,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they couldn\u2019t understand me and I couldn\u2019t understand them.\u201d</p> <p>Campus life is hyper-politicised. Political parties have close links to universities, with many lecturers doubling as party members. Two of the leaders of the Oromo Federalist Congress, one of the main opposition parties, are employed at Addis Ababa University. Two of the founders of the radical ethno-nationalist National Movement of Amhara are staff in Wollo University\u2019s law department.

  "<p><br></p> <p><em>A New World, 1942-1947,</em> Daniel Todman\u2019s second volume of <em>Britain\u2019s War \u2013 </em>the first was published four years ago \u2013 picks up the story after the entry of the US into the conflict following the Japanese attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor. A truly worldwide conflict had thus begun, with interlocking complexities that, nearly 80 years later, continue to challenge our understanding of modern British history.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/03/dunkirk-spirit-brexiters-uk-britain-europe\">Todman brings youth, energy, industry</a> and, above all, rare historical talent to his formidable task. But he is not, of course, the first British author to offer us a history of the conflict in more than one volume. Winston Churchill published six expansive and influential tomes in <em>The Second World War</em>, and only in his third volume in 1950 did the great man get us to Pearl Harbor. \u201cSo we had won after all!\u201d Churchill enthused, retrospectively free to express feelings that, at the time, the British prime minister had kept decently veiled from American eyes. \u201cOnce again in our long island history,\u201d Churchill now assured his readers, \u201cwe should emerge, however mauled or mutilated, safe and victorious.\u201d When Churchill thus appealed to history for vindication, it was in the knowledge that he intended to write that history himself.</p> <p>It is a tribute to the resilience of the Churchillian myth that such rhetoric still seems all too familiar in the era of Brexit. But historians of Todman\u2019s generation are right to move on beyond triumphalism and to speak to the times in which we live today. For Britain\u2019s role in the world is now nothing like what it was before Hitler invaded Poland, when the British empire comprised a quarter of the global population. Thus there were really two wars: one against the Nazi threat to the whole of Europe and the other to protect the British empire, most crucially in Asia. Broadly speaking, the first of these wars proved to be a moral and military success; the other turned out to be a failure. And in each case it had needed the intervention of the new superpowers, the USSR and the US, to retrieve the British from embarrassment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Todman comments that Churchill was a 'man who liked to make big plans on small maps'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Baldly put, this is the frame for the story as Todman tells it. However magnificent Churchill appeared in his commitment to saving Europe, the futile war to preserve the British empire mattered to him fully as much. Hence the searing impact of the sudden<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/16/singapore-fall-japan-british-surrender-1942\"> fall of Singapore </a>to the Japanese in February 1942, exposing Churchill\u2019s naive illusion that because this island port and naval base was always called \u201ca fortress\u201d, it was one that could withstand a siege. Todman\u2019s comment elsewhere that Churchill was a \u201cman who liked to make big plans on small maps\u201d captures some of his frailty in formulating grand strategy.</p> <p>It was a point that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/defence-and-security-blog/2015/oct/13/goodbye-to-land-warfare-no-says-controversial-new-study\">General Sir Alan Brooke</a> as chief of the Imperial General Staff often had cause to lament, not least in his diaries. If Churchill never mentioned Brooke in his six volumes, Todman certainly makes up for it in his citations. Brooke\u2019s protege, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/22/biography.highereducation\">Montgomery</a>, is depicted in generally favourable terms, but definitely warts and all, with no blindness towards the \u201cwitless self-aggrandisement\u201d that could so easily and so often offend the Americans. Conversely, when it comes to the D-day invasion and the ensuing campaign, Eisenhower is given his due as supreme allied commander, if only for his patience in keeping the peace between his own allied generals.</p> <p>All this forms one strand in Todman\u2019s story. But the extent to which Britain was a \u201cwarfare state\u201d, with an economy and technology built around national strategic priorities, is also brought out well. His account cites relevant statistical evidence that helps us to appreciate the texture of people\u2019s lives in an era when rationing constrained consumption.</p> <p>Above all, we are given a realistic appreciation of the texture of people\u2019s lives at a time when, as one official survey put it, most British workers, now no longer fearing imminent defeat, were \u201ccarrying on quietly rather than urgently\u201d. Government claims that there was no black market in 1943 met with 90% scepticism in one opinion poll. But this was not actually a black-and-white issue; there were markets of various shades of grey, as when housewives swapped ration coupons with neighbours \u2013 technically illegal \u2013 or their husbands quietly acquired goods of uncertain provenance. \u201cThis was the era in which \u2018it fell off the back of a lorry\u2019, as a euphemism for illicit acquisition, entered the popular lexicon.\u201d Not very Churchillian, perhaps; but this was a demonstrably well-fed prime minister for whom wartime food rationing was a problem that beset other people rather than himself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"320da5e9d48c9032d4001f0ee95a1cc954cc4b32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/320da5e9d48c9032d4001f0ee95a1cc954cc4b32/176_994_2543_1526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"February 1945: Winston Churchill, second right, with from left Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, Field Marshal Montgomery and General Simpson of the 9th Army.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">February 1945: Winston Churchill, second right, with from left Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, Field Marshal Montgomery and General Simpson of the 9th Army.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Ramage/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This second strand, binding together Todman\u2019s \u201ctotal history\u201d, helps to establish the broader social context and mentality of the wartime period. <em>A New World</em> conveys the experience of millions of people in Britain for whom Churchill was the toff with the big cigar who made those clever speeches on the Home Service of the BBC. It recaptures the perspective of the millions for whom \u201cMonty\u201d was the little man in a beret, as shown in the newsreels, standing on a tank in a faraway desert in North Africa, where our boys were \u2013 at last \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/08/erwin-rommel-papers-el-alamein-ww2\"> giving Rommel what for.</a> Here is the story of some of the big, world-shaking events as they were perceived by a mass audience \u2013 and electorate \u2013 at the time. Like other recent historians, Todman draws heavily on the archives of Mass Observation, an organisation improvised at the time to record popular experience.</p> <p>It would be wrong to give the impression that Churchill is diminished in this story. But he is rendered as mortal rather than iconic. He was more closely bound by backward-looking assumptions than were some of his new Labour colleagues in his coalition government. The stature of Clement Attlee, who became Churchill\u2019s trusted deputy prime minister, is fully recognised here. Likewise the role of Stafford Cripps, who briefly emerged, in the black days of 1942, as the most plausible potential challenger to Churchill\u2019s wartime pre-eminence (though he never chose to mount this challenge). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/dec/05/immigrationpolicy.politicalcolumnists\">Ernest Bevin, </a>already the country\u2019s most important trade union leader, came to the fore in mobilising the workforce, and Churchill had no more robust supporter in necessary wartime measures. But it was also Bevin who spelled out the political consequences in 1942: \u201cThis is a people\u2019s war: it must lead to a people\u2019s peace.\u201d</p> <p>The road to 1945 (as the historian Paul Addison felicitously termed it) thus portended a domestic political future in which the postwar displacement of the mighty Churchill by the underestimated Attlee ought not to have been such a shock. Charismatic leadership has its place, as the British people were not wrong to recognise in the great existential crisis of 1940. But it was in the succeeding years that the full reckoning came.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The postwar displacement of the mighty Churchill by the underestimated Attlee ought not to have been such a shock</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One brute fact was the extent of Britain\u2019s economic dependence on the US. Churchill\u2019s rhetoric clouded the issue here, notably when he hailed Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s proposal for<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/05/secondworldwar.comment\"> Lend-Lease </a>for its \u201cunsordid\u201d character. Roosevelt\u2019s bright idea, originally cooked up in the winter of 1940-41, when the US was still officially neutral, was indeed a lifesaver for cash-strapped Britain, now at the centre of an empire that was not just broken but broke. After American entry into the war, Lend-Lease burgeoned as an ingenious method of securing sufficient supplies for Britain, once its own resources were exhausted. The short-term effect was to make Britain reliant on the US not just for military needs but for domestic consumption.</p> <p>But the longer-term implication of this deal, in American eyes, was that some quid pro quo was due, sooner or later. The art of the deal was second nature to Roosevelt, famous for his own New Deal. So the quid pro quo for Lend-Lease, as became painfully clear by the end of the war, was that the Americans insisted on the ending of imperial preference on trade within the British empire: an empire that the US had no interest in perpetuating, having been the first to escape from it. Such were the terms demanded for entering what Churchill was to dub a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d. All told, victory did not bring quite what he had hoped for, as this book makes sufficiently clear.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Peter Clarke\u2019s The Locomotive of War: Money, Empire, Power and Guilt is published by Bloomsbury.

  "<p>In mid-February a colleague mentioned that for the first time in his life he was more concerned than his mother, who had been relatively blase about the risks of Covid-19. It felt odd for him to be telling her to take care. We are both professors in a department of infectious disease epidemiology, and we were worried.</p> \n<p>Two months on, that anxiety has not gone,<strong> </strong>although it\u2019s also been joined by a sense of sadness. It\u2019s now clear that so many people have died, and so many more are desperately ill, simply because our politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/deadly-virus-britain-failed-prepare-mers-sars-ebola-coronavirus\">refused to listen to and act on advice</a>. Scientists like us said lock down earlier; we said test, trace, isolate. But they decided they knew better.</p> \n<p>Am I being unfair? The government assures us that its decisions and timing are based on science, as if it is a neutral, value-free process resulting in a specific set of instructions. In reality, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/five-months-on-what-scientists-now-know-about-the-coronavirus\">science around coronavirus</a> is in its infancy and developing daily, with researchers across the world trying to understand how the virus spreads, how the body responds \u2013 and how to treat it and control it. The speed at which our knowledge has increased is impressive, from the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200131114748.htm\">sequencing of the virus</a> in January through to having <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/195055/imperial-researchers-race-develop-coronavirus-vaccine/\">candidate vaccines</a> in early February.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis\">Mathematical models</a> are being refined to predict the extent and speed of spread and estimate the impact of control methods. My own group is studying the response of communities, showing how the epidemic is amplifying existing <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050039v1\">social inequalities</a>. People with the lowest household income are far less likely, but no less willing, to be able to work from home or to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>But while scientists carry out observations and experiments, testing, iterating and discovering new knowledge, it is the role of policymakers to act on the best available evidence. In the context of a rapidly growing threat, that means listening to experts with experience of responding to previous epidemics.</p> \n<p>When I say that politicians \u201crefused to listen\u201d, I am referring to the advice and recommendations coming from the World Health Organization, from China and from Italy. The WHO advice, based on decades of experience and widely accepted by public health leaders and scientists around the world was clear \u2013 use every possible tool to suppress transmission. That meant testing and isolating cases, tracing and quarantining contacts, and ramping up hygiene efforts.</p> \n<p>The UK did well in the early phase, but then, on 12 March, the government alarmed many public health experts by abruptly abandoning containment and announcing that community case-finding and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/britain-covid-19-head-start-squandered\">contact-tracing would stop</a>. The aim was no longer to stop people getting it, but to slow it down while protecting the vulnerable.</p> \n<p>The evidence underpinning the government\u2019s decision appears in a report from 9 March summarising the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874290/05-potential-impact-of-behavioural-social-interventions-on-an-epidemic-of-covid-19-in-uk-1.pdf\">potential impact of behavioural and social interventions</a>. The report did not consider the impact of case-finding and contact-tracing, but it did suggest that the biggest impact on cases and deaths would come from social distancing and the protection of vulnerable groups.</p> \n<p>And yet social distancing was not recommended then. That day, 12 March, after hearing with disbelief the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\">government announcement</a> that didn\u2019t include widespread social distancing, I recommended to my team at Imperial that they should work from home for the foreseeable future. Indeed, I have not been to my office since.</p> \n<p>Neither the advice nor the science were followed that week. My colleagues, led by Neil Ferguson, <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">published </a><a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">a report</a> on 16 March estimating that without strong suppression, 250,000 people could die in the UK. The government responded that day with a recommendation for social distancing, avoiding pubs and working from home if possible. But there was still no enforcement, and it was left up to individuals and employers to decide what to do. Many people were willing but unable to comply as we showed <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-10-population-survey-covid-19/\">in a report on 20 March</a>. It was only on 23 March that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">more stringent lockdown</a> and economic support was announced.</p> \n<p>Between 12 and 23 March, tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of people will have been infected. Boris Johnson himself may well have been infected that week, and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">stay in the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">intensive care unit</a> may have been avoided if the government had shifted to remote working on 12 March. The current best estimate is that around 1% of those infected will die.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>So where to now? Once again, public health experience, including modelling, leads to some very clear recommendations. First, find cases in the community as well as hospitals and care homes; isolate them, and trace their contacts using a combination of local public health teams and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-live-news-nhs-staff-deaths-boris-johnson-latest-updates\">digital tools</a>.</p> \n<p>Second, know your epidemic. Track the epidemic nationally and locally using NHS, public health and digital surveillance to see where cases are continuing to spread. This will be essential so that we can start to lift the lockdown while shielding the population from hotspots of transmission. Build community resilience by providing local support for vulnerable people affected by the virus and the negative impact of the control measures.</p> \n<p>Third, ensure transmission is suppressed in hospitals, care homes and workplaces through the right protective equipment, testing, distancing and hygiene. Investigate the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\">differential effects on black and minority ethnic groups</a>, and provide appropriate protection.</p> \n<p>Fourth, ensure that the most vulnerable, socially and medically, are fully protected through simple access to a basic income, rights for migrants, and safety for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/14/fiona-dwyer-2m-for-coronavirus-domestic-abuse-victims-its-pitiful\">those affected by domestic violence</a>.</p> \n<p>Many, including the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, say that now is not the time for blame. I am not looking to blame \u2013 but for scrutiny so that lessons can be learned to guide our response. We need to avoid further mistakes, and ensure that the government is hearing, and acting on, the best advice.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Helen Ward is professor of public health at Imperial College London</p> \n<p><br></p>",

But it\u2019s to save the economy and we applaud the government for doing it.</p> \n  <p> But you and I lived through the largesse of the Rudd government with what happened with the financial crisis then. Are you at all concerned, as I am, the way it\u2019s been dealt with, that there may be some opportunity for the dudders to take hold? Because you know and I know every time, whether it\u2019s NDIS, whether it\u2019s preschools, whether it\u2019s childcare centres, as soon as the government says we\u2019re going to fund something, some low bludger formulates a plan to steal money from us? And I\u2019m fearful that even if a small amount of money is stolen \u2013 we\u2019re talking about billions of dollars being stolen \u2013 are you fearful we got a job in front of us to keep the lid on it?</p> \n  <p> <strong>Peter Dutton: Ray, it\u2019s a good point actually because we\u2019ve established a taskforce with the Australian Federal Police and investigators within Centrelink and within Services Australia because there will be an element of fraud</strong>, and those people need to hear a very clear message that now, more than ever, you are more likely to be caught and now more than ever, you have incredible scrutiny on these payments and if people do the wrong thing, then they can expect a search warrant to be executed by the Federal Police or they can expect their assets to be frozen.</p> \n  <p> There are other cases we\u2019re looking at, I was only looking at this morning in terms of people committing fraud against Australian taxpayers, against the commonwealth, and the police will restrain assets. They\u2019ll move very quickly to charge those people that have deliberately done the wrong thing. There will be those people that claim with good intent and they\u2019ve done the wrong thing, the money will have to be repaid and they\u2019ll go through all of that process, but the people you\u2019re talking about, the criminals, who would exploit the system, the technology that we\u2019ve got now to apply algorithms, look at transfers, to look at the way in which money is being diverted to different shelf companies, etc, those people are going to be under a lot of scrutiny. So, I think they should think twice about what they\u2019re doing.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T03:00:36.095Z\">at 4.00am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9675618f082c29014b1122\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T02:51:53.995Z\">3.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">AFP fraud 'taskforce' questions</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Last week, <strong>Peter Dutton </strong>had his regular love in with Sydney radio host <strong>Ray Hadley</strong>, where he mentioned a fraud \u201ctaskforce\u201d had been established in the AFP to deal with people who might be trying to rip off either the jobkeeper or jobseeker program.</p> \n  <p>He was pretty definitive about it:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em><strong>We have established a taskforce with the Australian Federal Police and investigators within Centrelink and within Services Australia</strong>, because there will be an element of fraud and those people need to hear a very clear message, that now, more than ever, you are more likely to be caught, and now more than ever, you have incredible scrutiny on these payments, and you can expect a search warrant to be executed by the Australian Federal Police and you can expect your assets to be frozen and there are other cases we are looking at ...</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> So <strong>Paul Karp</strong> and I asked the AFP what was happening with the taskforce.

The entry, search and seizure which occurred on 4 June 2019 were therefore unlawful.

Nor was it necessary to consider the validity of the order that had been made under s 3LA of the Crimes Act requiring Ms Smethurst to give assistance to enable a constable to access, copy or convert data on a computer or data storage device. <strong>The Court unanimously ordered that the warrant be quashed.

Scientists and advocates say these are essential to preventing the kind of pandemic currently sweeping the globe.</p> <p>Though no pangolins live in the US, an endangered species designation could make additional funding available to preserve the species, bolster efforts to crack down on illegal trade and send a powerful signal to the international community that the animals ought to be protected.</p> <p>Like HIV, Sars and Ebola before it, the coronavirus that is wreaking devastation worldwide is a zoonotic disease, meaning that it spilled over from animals to humans. It is widely believed that the disease originated in bats and was transmitted to humans in a live animal market in Wuhan, China, where a variety of animals mixed amid a bustling human crowd.</p> <p>Pangolins, which harbor coronaviruses similar to the one that causes Covid-19, may have played a role in the virus\u2019s mutation and transmission to humans, though this theory remains <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/science/pangolin-coronavirus.html\">in question</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93afb7b350192e045ea56ce99d213e6d82642b7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93afb7b350192e045ea56ce99d213e6d82642b7d/0_0_3500_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A customs officer gives water to pangolins before a news conference in Bangkok, Thailand, in September 2011 after officers stopped a truck carrying 97 pangolins en route to be sold in China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A customs officer gives water to pangolins before a news conference in Bangkok, Thailand, in September 2011 after officers stopped a truck carrying 97 pangolins en route to be sold in China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chaiwat Subprasom/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What scientists know for certain is that the emergence of such zoonotic diseases occurs when humans disrupt healthy ecosystems, invade wildlife habitat, and trade and traffic in wild animals, whether bats, pangolins, birds, rodents or civets, a type of cat-like mammal that is often illegally trafficked and played a role in <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.who.int%2Fith%2Fdiseases%2Fsars%2Fen%2F\">transmitting Sars</a> to humans in the early 2000s. In this way, they expose themselves to deadly new pathogens, said Dr Jonathan Epstein, a vice-president at the EcoHealth Alliance, an organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and preventing zoonotic diseases.</p> <p>\u201cWhen ecosystems start to get disrupted, when we increase our contact with wildlife, that is when we see more opportunity for pathogens to jump from their wild animal reservoirs into domestic animals or humans,\u201d Epstein said.</p> <p>A 2017 <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00923-8\">study found</a> that a \u201cmajority of emerging infectious diseases (and almost all recent pandemics) originate in animals, mostly wildlife\u201d, as a result of interactions with people and livestock.</p> <p>The US has historically been a global leader in the creation and the promotion of the kind of wildlife conservation efforts that may help prevent the emergence of new diseases. The US passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973, and it played a seminal role in the 1973 signing of the Cites treaty, which erected an international framework for the protection of imperiled animals and plants.</p> <p>Under the Trump administration, however, the US has abandoned its leadership role in this arena, and critics say that the administration\u2019s faltering commitment couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse moment.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not like any one thing would have stopped this pandemic, so you can\u2019t make that generalization,\u201d said Brett Hartl, the government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cBut if the US were actually a leader in international wildlife conservation like it used to be back in the day and actually took its obligations seriously and was putting real pressure on trafficking and countries like China to stop decimation of pangolins and other species, who knows where we would be today.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump administration has presided over a broad rollback of wildlife conservation measures in recent years, weakening the Endangered Species Act enforcement and slowing the number of species added to the endangered list each year. And it has sought to slash the budget of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the country\u2019s principal wildlife agency, which investigates wildlife traffickers and protects imperiled species at home and abroad.</p> <p>The Trump administration also wants to cut more than $300m from programs run by the state department and USAid that promote habitat conservation and combat wildlife trafficking in Asia, Africa and elsewhere, according to <a href=\"https://www.usglc.org/the-budget/analysis-of-the-administrations-fy21-international-affairs-budget-request/\">a February report</a> from the US Global Leadership Coalition. In light of threats such as Covid-19 and the climate crisis, the report asserts, the administration\u2019s proposed cuts are \u201cout of touch with America\u2019s interests\u201d.</p> <p>Covid-19, scientists and advocates argue, has proven that this is not a time to reduce the US\u2019s commitments to protecting and restoring the world\u2019s ailing animal populations.</p> <p>\u201cAs we have seen with this virus, every country is part of an interconnected world,\u201d said Dr Barney Long, the senior director of species conservation at the group Global Wildlife Conservation.</p> <p>\u201cThe wildlife trade is not a \u2018China problem\u2019,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe have to act as one global community rather than individual countries or we are not going to break through these issues.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Coronavirus and its associated troubles is not the only matter to have caused Jay Monahan recent strain. As golf, like all other sports, now seeks to navigate a path towards a resumption there will inevitably be a sense that additional challenges may disappear. They may actually multiply. Monahan, in his role as the PGA Tour\u2019s commissioner, encountered turmoil this year, even before the pandemic.</p> <p>The Premier Golf League dominated discussion in the early part of the year, even though sceptics insist this is a scheme based in dreamland. It isn\u2019t going away, you know. Or is it? Must it?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/31/rory-mcilroy-interview-golf-portrush-the-open-masters-tiger-woods\">Rory McIlroy: 'I had to take a long, hard look at myself after Portrush'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brooks Koepka followed the outspoken lead of Rory McIlroy by declaring himself not interested in breaking rank from the PGA Tour. Jon Rahm and Bubba Watson added similar sentiments. These would be deemed fatal blows were those behind the PGL, hardly known as fantasists, not fully inclined to plough on. In fact, their pitches to a broader body of players were imminent when the PGA Tour season ground to a halt. But is the expansion now worthwhile; would a seemingly substandard product fly?</p> <p>Monahan\u2019s pre-Players Championship media conference was littered with PGL questions. This project, six years quietly in the making, aims to coax top players towards an F1-style environment, with a team facet all part of the plan. Money is no object. Raine Capital, which has previous for shaking up traditional sporting markets, has been involved with PGL for more than two years. The top players can have vast chunks of it guaranteed, even before they whack a Titleist in anger. It is the ultimate disruption plan.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, which had controversially offered financial backing to the PGL, may now be of a mind to back off and retain an existing relationship with the <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/sport/european-tour\">European Tour</a>. Even that, in emphasising the PGL\u2019s bullishness, would be shrugged off with others said to be waiting in the wings to subscribe.</p> <p>PGL insiders insist coronavirus hasn\u2019t blunted their fiscal power; yet it has, unquestionably if perhaps temporarily, done precisely that to the PGA and especially European Tours. That the PGA Tour will imminently announce a planned return in mid-June, minus spectators, shows it is either unwilling or unable to remain in cold storage for long. The European Tour has warned of purse reductions.</p> <p>McIlroy\u2019s dismissal of the PGL was noteworthy on numerous levels, not least because of his thought process. Still, the world No 1 was perceptive enough to leave himself an out. \u201cMy position is I\u2019m against it until there may come a day that I can\u2019t be against it,\u201d the Northern Irishman said. \u201cIf everyone else goes, I might not have a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Adam Scott has doubled down on his assertion that the PGL proposal is a \u201cfantastic\u201d one. \u201cI\u2019m still very positive about the concept of what it could be, for sure,\u201d the Australian said. Henrik Stenson has spoken positively too.</p> <p>Phil Mickelson, the player most closely linked with the PGL, is known to have held face-to-face talks with Monahan on the subject during the Florida swing. What the PGL needs is a public buy-in from players or it will ultimately wither on the vine. Monahan admitted he has not met the PGL\u2019s chief executive, Andy Gardiner, which is strange but endorses the sense of a turf war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e21d5cbe826365eb77e19f072af0f80a00de0ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e21d5cbe826365eb77e19f072af0f80a00de0ad/0_0_3299_1979/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Adam Scott is one of the few elite players to publicly support the PGL\u2019s plans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Scott is one of the few elite players to publicly support the PGL\u2019s plans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Sladky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The PGA Tour has a new, multi-year broadcasting deal that supposedly affirms its stranglehold on the game. A simple inference is that it ramped up the commercial value of players who have committed to its principles. Bringing ESPN into the equation alongside NBC was a smart move by the PGA Tour; it limits the PGL\u2019s broadcast scope. Still, golf\u2019s viewer demographic is not getting any younger and there have to be legitimate questions about the game\u2019s appeal in a post-Tiger age.</p> <p>PGL management will realise there is every possibility of their work being used as leverage by players. It may have brought the European and PGA Tours closer together, which points to potential for an overdue world circuit. Monahan, though, and his European equivalent, Keith Pelley, are leading members organisations where change to suit even the vast majority isn\u2019t straightforward.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/29/henrik-stenson-golf-olympics-ryder-cup-coronavirus\">Henrik Stenson: 'I don't feel the rush to practise and play'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The basic need for structural alterations in golf will be glaring when it returns; tours compete against each other in a limited player and date market. That model, regardless of whether the PGL is viewed as credible or not, cannot continue. McIlroy expressed concerns about a \u201csaturated\u201d tournament market during the Arnold Palmer Invitational.</p> <p>\u201cOur attitude all the way through this has only been, we will build and we will persevere and we will offer the opportunity for people to make a choice,\u201d Gardiner said in February. \u201cWe spent six years building an extraordinarily solid platform which gives us the opportunity to facilitate whatever decision is made by third parties.\u201d Presumably this includes outright rejection.</p> <p>Golf has been placed into a state of flux by the coronavirus outbreak. It is maybe crude to suggest PGL can seize an opportunity from that, but the operation can now return to working away from view, having led the news agenda before the shutdown. It would seem silly to disregard this ambitious scheme quite yet.</p>",
  "<p>If you\u2019re attempting to work from home, a conundrum has probably presented itself: how can you get anything done in a distracting environment amid unsettled times?</p> <p>Your streaming service or record collection may hold the answer. Beyond providing background noise, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4197792/\">music has been shown</a> to improve both productivity and cognitive performance, especially in adults. Listening to music can help people manage anxiety, become motivated and stay productive. You just need to know how to make the right playlist.</p> <h2><strong>Start off slow</strong></h2> <p>Kick off the day with a trick from music therapy. The concept is known as the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mtp/article-abstract/33/1/45/1134120\">iso principle</a>, which is a technique therapists use to alter the mood of a patient. The therapist will match music to how the patient is feeling, and then gradually alter the songs to achieve the desired mood state.</p> <p>The songs at the beginning of the playlist shouldn\u2019t force you into a state of productivity, but they should gradually bring you there. While song choice will vary by person, Kirsten Nelson, a music therapist at the University of Iowa Stead family children\u2019s hospital, suggests tracks like Here Comes the Sun by the Beatles and Ooh Child, by the Five Stairsteps as places to start.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re feeling really down in the morning, then find something peaceful to start with,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cFrom there, you can bring yourself into a more motivating song to achieve the state you want.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Transition into a \u2018</strong><strong>power song</strong><strong>\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Researchers have found that a faster track speed can result in increased performance. In <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19793214\">one study</a> that examined the relationship between music tempo and productivity, most test subjects performed best while listening to songs paced at <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1600-0838.2009.00948.x\">around 121bpm</a>. This is about as fast as tracks like Carly Rae Jepsen\u2019s Call Me Maybe, Whitney Houston\u2019s I Wanna Dance with Somebody, and I Will Survive, by Diana Ross.</p> <p>Nelson refers to this phenomenon as finding the \u201cpower song\u201d, which can used to motivate the listener to be productive. \u201cI think that music can activate people in a way that other things cannot,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we\u2019re looking to get into a place where we might have some more energy and motivation, a power song can be very helpful.\u201d Nelson says that adding power songs at strategic points in a work playlist, such as right when the day starts, while transitioning between tasks, and as the day ends, can help maintain motivation.</p> <h2><strong>Rethink your lyrics</strong></h2> <p>Nelson says that the choice to include lyrical tracks in a playlist should depend on individual preference. While <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/music-and-productivity/\">research suggests</a> that listening to upbeat, complex music can help workers stay alert and motivated while performing repetitive tasks, narrative lyrics can be distracting to those trying to do cognitive work. The bulk of a work playlist should include songs with innocuous or subtlely performed lyrics, such as those by artists like Grouper, Brian Eno and Jenny Hval. For those who prefer non-lyrical music, music by Dawn of Midi, Steve Reich and John Adams are great places to start.</p> <p>And, while lyrics can be a powerful motivator, don\u2019t automatically reach for your favorite tracks. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0305735611422672?journalCode=poma&amp;utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier\">One study</a> found a decrease in performance while listening to songs characterized as \u201cfamiliar vocal music\u201d.

Rather, it can be something that accretes over time. \u201cIf you hear a song and know that it makes you feel good, pop it into a playlist,\u201d says Nelson. As the playlist grows, arrange tracks in the order that makes sense for the way you work. \u201cAllow yourself permission to listen to new music, try out new things, take things out, bring things in,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cAllow yourself that flexibility.\u201d If you don\u2019t feel like listening to your playlist, you don\u2019t have to.</p> <h2>Suggested productivity playlist</h2> <p>Tracks 1-4 are for transitioning into work.

  "<p>Inflamed by President Trump\u2019s casual phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d, anti-Asian sentiment is erupting all over the world. As a British-Vietnamese person who has been spat on because of the colour of her skin, the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/10/tigertail-review-alan-yang-tzi-ma-taiwan\">Tigertail</a> is a glimmer of hope \u2013 a way of showing the truth, and connecting Asian communities at a time when panic and misinformation serve to break us apart. Alan Yang\u2019s multi-generational love story Tigertail weaves in Yang\u2019s cultural self-discovery and features memories of Taiwan, as experienced by the protagonist Pin-Jui. Weighted against the present tide of anti-Asian bigotry, this tender story about honesty and lost love is more relevant than ever.</p> <p>\u201cAmerican culture has been negligent in portraying Asian-American people as fully realised human beings,\u201d <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/04/new-hollywood-podcast-alan-yang-tigertail-asian-american-immigrant-diversity-inclusion-representation-1202901612/\">Yang told the Deadline podcast</a>. Yang, who worked on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/how-we-made-parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-nick-offerman-mike-schur\">Parks and Recreation</a> before co-creating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/06/aziz-ansari-master-of-none-netflix\">Master of None</a>, recalled the trepidation he felt in the early days of his career, in a cultural landscape where east Asians were rarely represented, or stereotyped as hardworking automatons. Yang said he had felt restricted to using only white characters in his early pilots, fearing that all-Asian or Asian-American scripts would never be accepted. But this was before the film successes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/13/crazy-rich-asians-review-kevin-kwan\">Crazy Rich Asians</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/31/the-farewell-review-awkwafina-sundance\">The Farewell</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/09/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-tragicomic-masterpiece\">Parasite </a>brought real Asian faces to mainstream culture.</p> <p>I felt utter joy and relief at seeing my own identity conflicts explored on screen. With dialogue almost entirely in Mandarin and Taiwanese from an all-Asian cast, Tigertail illuminates the Taiwanese immigrant experience by showing it through emotions. Yang\u2019s drama traces the journey of Taiwanese factory worker Pin-Jui from his home town to America, as well as the sometimes painful discord that separates us from those we love the most. A rallying cry against caricatures of the stoic \u201cAsian dad\u201d, Tigertail lays bare the complexity of Pin-Jui\u2019s interiority: the path he takes towards his American dream, how he stumbles and learns from his mistakes and how he grows from them. The film moves between his life as a young man in the 1960s and the present day in New York. The dual time-frames reveal a mind shifting uneasily between a new, chosen culture and the vibrant one left behind. In the present-day timeline \u2013 deliberately desaturated and drained of vibrancy \u2013 an older Pin-Jui struggles to empathise with his US-born daughter Angela, who has spent her life feeling as if she couldn\u2019t talk to her father.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f4c22605f0fbe6e50cc4fa9c88631fe2b5fbaf8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f4c22605f0fbe6e50cc4fa9c88631fe2b5fbaf8/279_648_6921_4154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tzi Ma, left, and and Christine Ko in Tigertail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tzi Ma, left, and and Christine Ko in Tigertail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Shatz/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That resonated deeply with me. My parents fled to Britain as Vietnamese refugees in their late teens. Because my father speaks very basic English and I speak poor Vietnamese, honest feelings cannot easily be communicated between us. The unrest within Asian families comes not from what is said out loud, but often from what is left unsaid. This cultural muteness echoes throughout Tigertail. In the film\u2019s opening sequence, a young Pin-Jui sobs in desperation for his parents. \u201cCrying never solves anything,\u201d his grandmother scolds him sternly in Taiwanese. \u201cBe strong. Never let anyone see you cry.\u201d In many Asian traditions, including my own, the way to be strong is to conceal your emotions. But non-traditional circumstances call upon us to readjust. How can this silence persist during a global pandemic, when the elderly are being asked to isolate themselves entirely?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8lp_eI78ZM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i8lp_eI78ZM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Piecing together my family\u2019s story has helped me grasp the sacrifices that my family made in order to secure hope for the next generation. It\u2019s brought me closer to my parents. I\u2019ve learned to appreciate their perspective and our differences. Like Pin-Jui\u2019s leap into the unknown, my family\u2019s journey paved the way for successive generations, even if each generation is a little further from that original sacrifice, a little more removed from the country that was once home.</p> <p>While Yang\u2019s personal life informs Tigertail in many ways, the film is also about being human and knowing that we can\u2019t face hurt on our own. It reinforces the perseverance and strength of the Asian community in embracing new lives, often at the cost of giving up another. Tigertail\u2019s window into a Taiwanese-American family speaks volumes for those who have felt unable to express themselves, through being marginalised or because they don\u2019t know how to.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Georgina Quach is a freelance journalist</p> <p><br></p>",

  "<p>What does it take to survive a pandemic? Waiting, mostly, and if nothing kills you, then you make it out alive. I do mean to suggest here that survival is passive, in the way that you don\u2019t have to do anything to heal a cut, you just let time pass. And so these days, I let time happen to me. Ever since I lost my job at a fashion magazine (furloughed indefinitely) I have spent the quarantine in Berlin measuring away the days by the box of sunlight that moves across my unkept bedsheets. Sobriety grinds. I might reread the same 10 sentences of \u017di\u017eek over again, unable to concentrate, and resort to lying in bed and listening to podcasts. Sometimes, I think about God. At night, I tune into friends\u2019 live streams as they DJ in empty rooms and I try to dance in place but mostly feel stupid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/14/mental-health-ward-not-equipped-coronavirus-feel-sitting-ducks-ppe\">My mental health ward is not equipped for coronavirus.

I am moved by this romantic but helpless gesture \u2013 the artist-hero painting as morgues all around him overcrowd with bodies. I\u2019m less capable of heroic productivity, but I\u2019m really good at waiting. Quarantine has made me think about the nine months I\u2019d spent in virtual isolation at my parents\u2019 house in California in 2013, after I was sexually assaulted by a homeless man in New York. I had lost my job then \u2013 fired, because a habit (cry for help?) of doing coke in the handicapped stall made me erratic and unreliable at the office, but even if anyone wanted to ask what was going on, I wouldn\u2019t tell them. So I canceled all the plans I had made for my life, and moved back into my childhood bedroom, where I slept beneath a concert poster from the band I played with in high school.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In a reality where 'anything can happen' and cancel your life, you stop making plans</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My parents cooked for me, but we didn\u2019t talk much during dinners. Later that summer, my grandmother died. Honestly, I hate talking about that year, though these days my mind homes around it. Then, like now, I was unable to forecast my future because I wasn\u2019t convinced that the underlying structures that make it possible to plan beyond one week in advance, let alone the tasks of a day, still held. In a reality where \u201canything can happen\u201d and cancel your life, you stop making plans. I was too bitter of the trauma I was dealt, consigning my days to an aggressive boredom that rendered anticipation a pleasure so sharp I couldn\u2019t tell it from dread.</p> <p>My life never exactly went back to normal. In the seven years since the assault, the sexual and romantic life I thought I deserved was never returned. For years, I couldn\u2019t have sex. I hated disclosing the assault to people, because it made them treat me with kid gloves, even though I felt perennially raw and defensive. Still, I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend, the regret of my life. I have lived this way for so long that I forget that it could have been different. I deserved more then. We deserve more now.</p> <p>Our lives are not going back to normal, as one way of being has been abruptly and unilaterally aborted, without our consent. Instead, we\u2019re left with the grief for tens of thousands of lives lost, trillions of dollars evaporated, and a future of promise that was wiped out for an entire generation.</p> <p>Some days grief entails languishing in bed, because that <em>is </em>surviving. Though clarity can come when doing nothing. Even in global cataclysm, I believe in integrity, in remembering who I was before trauma tried to claim me in its single-mindedness. You can only find integrity by spending <em>this much time</em> with yourself. Even as my free time smothers, being enveloped by my own thoughts and anxieties can be generative. Such solitude is not a state, but a practice you get better at over time. When limited to the mere resources of your own mind in the solitude that is the \u201cradical nakedness of the soul\u201d (Catherine Malabou), you become trained to trust your own thoughts alone to see you through the terror. Sit with the embarrassment of uncertainty. Even fear can be nourishing \u2013 it alerts the senses, ripens colors. Self-becoming is an unsentimental business, from which you emerge bruised but fortified, ready to relate to the renewing terrors of the world with a kind of leathery compassion: character.</p> <p>I survived the assault, I\u2019ll live through this, I\u2019ll get out of bed. To break up the days, I\u2019ll sometimes go for a walk by the canal outside my apartment wearing a Prada coat that, now without a job, I\u2019d no longer be able to afford. But I have to stick to the decisions I\u2019ve made. I stand by the person I was before the virus.</p> <ul> <li><p>Geoffrey Mak is a writer in Berlin</p></li> </ul>",

For some countries, the worst may be beginning to pass; for others, things may be about to darken further. The uncertainty is almost as discomfiting as our fears of the illness. Since the Weekly carried its first small report on the novel coronavirus on 10 January (\u201cRespiratory contagion is not Sars, authorities say\u201d) the world has changed in ways that few could have imagined possible. </p> <p>Last week the Guardian ran a fascinating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world\">series of articles</a> on the 100 days in which Covid-19 went from a small flicker in the world\u2019s consciousness to the defining crisis of a generation. We\u2019re pleased to feature a selection of them in this week\u2019s edition of the Weekly. We begin with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanfreedland\">Jonathan Freedland</a>\u2019s analysis of how the disaster has unfolded in the UK and around the world \u2013 a change so fast we can barely grasp its scale. Our global environment editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathanwatts\">Jonathan Watts</a> considers the low-carbon, wildlife-friendly state we find ourselves in \u2013 and asks if we can find a way to make it last. Then, Guardian economics editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/larryelliott\">Larry Elliott</a> looks at the speed in which the global economy was ravaged by the virus, and diplomatic editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour\">Patrick Wintour</a> considers the geopolitical winners and losers from the crisis. </p> <p>Our Covid-19 analysis continues with a look at why the virus has been so effective at targeting the poor in the United States \u2013 now the world\u2019s worst-hit country.</p> <p>Then, in the UK, we look back at Boris Johnson\u2019s week in hospital. Will his brush with mortality influence his famously cavalier outlook? We also report on the very un-Britishly efficient building of field hospitals and mortuaries in preparation for the worst weeks of the virus. We\u2019re also looking at the latest science, lessons on immunology and much more throughout the magazine, including a brilliant read by the food writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/bee-wilson\">Bee Wilson</a> about the psychology behind stockpiling food in a crisis.</p> <p>As you\u2019d expect, Covid-19 is affecting almost everything that\u2019s happening on the planet at the moment. However, we\u2019re keen to make sure there\u2019s more than just the virus in the magazine. This week we have a beautiful feature from the Guardian\u2019s US team by Chris Sweeney about a golden eagle and the mystery surrounding its death. In our culture pages, rock critic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis\">Alexis Petridis</a> meets the Strokes ahead of their sixth album and finds a band who have finally come out of their shell (a bit). </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrew-male\">Andrew Male</a> meets the woman who makes eerily affecting collages from plastic detritus washed in from the sea \u2013 and, in books, we round up the best new (and old) books for kids stuck indoors.

  "<p>The apocalypse needs to end. Anyone who writes about apocalypse today is bound to acknowledge that humans have worried and theorised about it for as long as they have worried and theorised about anything; at some point, the writer is guaranteed to employ the word \u201ceschatological\u201d as a nod to the fact that apocalypse is an essential principle of major and minor religions. Yet for a foundational concept it\u2019s quite hard to pin down. Just as \u201creality\u201d is elusive in a once-fragmented world that has (very creatively) reassembled itself online, the apocalypse can apply to whatever you want it to: the Greek root means to uncover or reveal, hence the Book of Revelation, hence the hard truths we learn about humanity\u2019s consequential inaction in every apocalypse story. Marxist revolution can be an apocalypse; relationship experts speak about the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d of divorce. Apocalypse is a shifting abstraction, a deceptively neat encapsulation of cascading associations and ideas. The End is endlessly debatable, everywhere and nowhere, relative, adaptable, accommodating to many levels of interpretation. As the funny refrain in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s apocalyptic film <em>Parasite</em> goes, it\u2019s \u201cso metaphorical\u201d.</p> <p>This is not how many people see it. Along with evangelical Christians, doomsday preppers, and bored Silicon Valley billionaires scheming to colonise Mars or flee to New Zealand, the popular imagination has a pretty intuitive grasp of the apocalypse: it refers to the end of the world, or at least human civilisation. The destruction of everything, or enough of everything that it is impossible to rebuild anything good. According to a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/03/18/apocalypse-climate-change-pandemic-coronavirus\">YouGov poll</a> conducted in February of this year, 29% of Americans believe an \u201capocalyptic disaster\u201d will occur at some point during their lifetime; given Greta Thunberg\u2019s popularity, it\u2019s fair to say that many more believe one will take place within their children\u2019s lifetimes. (A majority of those polled by YouGov believed they could survive a week or less after apocalyptic disaster, a self-awareness I find heartening.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba40d0e1042b773bc5de43b1711b261c55649523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba40d0e1042b773bc5de43b1711b261c55649523/0_87_2732_1640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho, 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s \u2018so metaphorical!\u2019: <em>Parasite</em>, directed by Bong Joon-ho, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Curzon Artificial Eye/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even lovers of hermeneutics will hedge their bets. After all, a non-metaphorical apocalypse could result from a few types of disaster, arriving suddenly or accumulating gradually over time: climate catastrophe; a nuclear war; an unlikely asteroid; a pandemic \u2013 likely not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the current one</a> \u2013 that can\u2019t be contained. While most stories that imagine the apocalypse are not realistic (zombies are another metaphor, the rapid-onset ice age depicted in <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em> a misguided extrapolation, and the Bible not in fact meant to be taken literally) the anxiety that surrounds them comes from a deep sense of pragmatism. Prevailing opinion these days is that the apocalypse is not only going to take place, it\u2019s more likely to take place than ever, especially if you plot the rate of its increasing likelihood on a logarithmic scale very few people know how to read. Plots of all kinds tend to make people very excited. If the worst <em>could </em>happen, it only makes sense that you should act as if it <em>will</em>. Especially if you have children.</p> <p>Here lies the conflict at the centre of Mark O\u2019Connell\u2019s new book, <em>Notes from an Apocalypse: A Personal Journey to the End of the World and Back</em>. The indefinite article, \u201can\u201d apocalypse, provides a clue to his inclinations. He has a PhD in English literature and notes that \u201cthroughout my 20s and into my 30s, the writers who seemed to me to possess the truest vision of the world \u2026 were those who rejected most thoroughly the idea that life might be on aggregate a good thing\u201d. Yet we encounter him hovering uneasily in the space between theory and reality, existing in the break of <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43290/the-second-coming\">WB Yeats\u2019s line</a>, \u201cThe best lack all conviction, while the worst / Are full of passionate intensity\u201d. The merely intellectual approach, untested by actually pressing circumstances, has lately been failing him. On-the-nose signs of impending doom are all around, bombarding him with images of contemporary discord, and they\u2019re really freaking him out.</p> <p>Given its publication date in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, critics are calling this book timely, appropriate and prescient. Though the possibility of a pandemic only comes up occasionally in the book, as one option in a series of hypothetical catastrophes, current events generally support O\u2019Connell\u2019s attitude, which is that any collapse will be the result of a complicated system of effects from which a single cause cannot be determined. (If he had to say, though, he would likely reply: \u201cBecause capitalism\u201d.) \u201cIt was the end of the world, and I was sitting on the couch watching cartoons with my son,\u201d O\u2019Connell writes. As his son giggles at the show, about a little girl and \u201cthe comic scrapes she gets embroiled in with her long-suffering bear companion\u201d, dad holds his phone \u2013 \u201cmy eschatology handset, my streaming service of last things\u201d \u2013 above his child\u2019s head, scrolling through Twitter. He stumbles on a video advertised as \u201csoul-crushing\u201d and \u201cheart-wrenching\u201d; naturally, he clicks. Set to a \u201cslow and mournful glissando\u201d played by a cello, the video warns of the effects of climate change and features an \u201cemaciated polar bear dragging itself across a rocky terrain\u201d in search of a morsel of sustenance. It gives O\u2019Connell \u201cmoral vertigo, resulting from the fact that the very technology that allowed me to witness the final pathetic tribulations of this emaciated beast was in fact a cause of the animal\u2019s suffering in the first place\u201d. The \u201cabsurd juxtaposition\u201d of cartoon and real bear makes him feel \u201ca surge of shame and sadness at the world my son would be forced to live in, a shame and sadness that I in turn was passing on to him\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f35d7eb9a0b469291644f9d437c7b146e5aa0622\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f35d7eb9a0b469291644f9d437c7b146e5aa0622/1188_218_4139_2485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A polar bear on the outskirts of the Russian industrial city of Norilsk, June 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A polar bear on the outskirts of the Russian industrial city of Norilsk, June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Irina Yarinskaya/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the end of 2016, \u201cthe winter of an ignoble year\u201d, when \u201cthe more or less hourly vibration in my pocket was a kind of post-traumatic thrum, a bracing for whatever fresh hell I was about to peer into.\u201d Were he childless, or less aware of the reality that humanity demonstrates a horrible resilience in the face of struggle, and suffering is often never redeemed, he\u2019d probably prefer to die in the apocalypse than to pursue whatever violent, desperate life might come after, not that he would have much choice in the matter. \u201cWhatever form the apocalypse came in,\u201d he tells a friend who admits to keeping a well-stocked \u201cgo-bag\u201d under her bed, \u201cI would almost certainly be in the first wave of deaths. We both laughed, but I think she knew that I was not entirely joking.\u201d Unsettled, he muses that, \u201cas an individual, as a parent, I wanted the world to live on after me \u2026 But perhaps the reasons for my interest in the end of the world were more complicated than I was prepared to acknowledge. Perhaps my terrors and my desires were more intimately related than I knew.\u201d</p> <p>The last four years have seen a spate of articles wondering, in the age of climate crisis and denial: \u201cIs it OK to have a child?\u201d Most writers decide it is, coalescing around the joy of family as a collective good and the (unproven) belief that parenthood may spur people to action on behalf of their children. In 2016 O\u2019Connell\u2019s son is already three, so gaming out the ethics of reproduction is not a thought experiment he bothers long with. This is the closest thing he has to pressing circumstances \u2013 for now \u2013 so instead he sets out on a series of \u201cperverse pilgrimages\u201d to \u201clandscapes both real and imaginary where the end of the world could be glimpsed\u201d. The internet is followed by a sojourn to the South Dakota prairie, where a former army munitions facility is being transformed into a \u201csurvival shelter community\u201d of customisable bunkers for obnoxious upper-middle-class preppers, whose notoriously overboard internet rabbit holes O\u2019Connell has also explored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b90ba5171849b80683452af7a6cab235698077d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b90ba5171849b80683452af7a6cab235698077d3/0_497_6637_3983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doomsday community: Vivos xPoint survival shelters in South Dakota.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doomsday community: Vivos xPoint survival shelters in South Dakota.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then he goes to New Zealand, which truly rich libertarian venture capitalists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/feb/15/why-silicon-valley-billionaires-are-prepping-for-the-apocalypse-in-new-zealand\">Peter Thiel</a> have designated the optimal place to wait out \u201csystemic collapse\u201d \u2013 and where professed socialists such as O\u2019Connell might see the Second Coming in their progressive young prime minister Jacinda Ardern, who has explicity prioritised her citizens\u2019 wellbeing over economic growth. At a conference on Mars colonialisation in Los Angeles he attends a talk called \u201cLiberty in Space\u201d and reflects on how the \u201cfundamentally male narrative of exit, of escape as a means toward the nobility of self-determination\u201d dovetails with American capitalism; if Mars is the backup when Earth is uninhabitable, someone is going to have to be in charge of it.</p> <p>On a camping retreat in a remote, rewilded area of the Scottish Highlands \u2013 arranged by a group that believes climate catastrophe is \u201cinevitable\u201d, so people should \u201chope beyond hope\u201d for a better world to come by learning to reintegrate with nature \u2013 he reflects on Dr Seuss\u2019s classic climate-change parable, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/20/the-lorax-dr-seuss-old-vic-review\">The Lorax</a></em>, which he has read to his son. Finally, he and a friend visit the Chernobyl exclusion zone, where they take a depressing guided tour through what he sees as both \u201cthe ruins of a collapsed utopian project, a vast crumbling monument to an abandoned past\u201d and \u201can immersive simulation of the future, an image of what will come in our wake\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of area to cover between not yet and too late. O\u2019Connell zigzags across it many times, but he sticks to well-trodden paths, from relatable observations about his own ultimately hypocrisies to theoretical interpretations: the apocalypse as patriarchy, as white-supremacy, as colonialism, as genocide, as luxury consumerism, as a projection of the individual\u2019s anxiety about his own death, as \u201cnostalgia for the future\u201d. (Thankfully, there are no charts attempting to represent messianic time.) After apologising for travelling to all the locations in the book by plane, acknowledging his carbon footprint is \u201cas broad and deep and indelible as my guilt\u201d, he declares: \u201cMy days are a procession of last things, seals opened. I myself am the apocalypse of which I speak. That is the prophecy of this book.\u201d</p> <p>By the end, he fulfils this prophecy by ending up where he started, looking at the news on his phone, but he feels better. \u201cI wonder now whether it is because of or despite the strange series of pilgrimages I have been on that I have come at last to this place of accommodation \u2026 it became apparent to me that a state of perpetual anxiety was no way to live. It constituted a kind of retreat, and that that retreat was a kind of dying.\u201d Through what he thinks could be \u201cexposure therapy\u201d, he\u2019s learned to accept that \u201cwe have no idea what might come to pass\u201d, but in the meantime being alive is at least \u201cinteresting\u201d, in the precocious words of his young son.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa770d93f3b454bf0e2789c50506e9147c1dd637\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa770d93f3b454bf0e2789c50506e9147c1dd637/0_94_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pripyat, in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

Persistently high levels of radiation make the area uninhabitable for thousands of years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a blurb, the novelist Jenny Offill describes O\u2019Connell as \u201ca genius guide through all the circles of imagined or anticipated doom\u201d, and reading his descriptions of his tour of Chernobyl, I thought the word \u201cguide\u201d was very apt. At one point, the group goes into an abandoned school and finds a room in which \u201ca dozen or so toddler-size chairs were arranged in a circle, and on each was perched a rotting doll or distempered teddy bear\u201d. O\u2019Connell has the \u201cunsettling\u201d realisation that \u201cthis scene had been carefully arranged by a visitor, probably quite recently, precisely in order for it to be photographed\u201d. A guide\u2019s job is to show you what you expect, just more so: a representation of reality that emphasises what you always believed. It rarely has much to do with the guide\u2019s own life.</p> <p>***</p> <p>As the literary critic<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/dec/05/frank-kermode-interview-christopher-tayler\"> Frank Kermode</a> had it, the apocalypse is a fiction, one that lends humanity a \u201csense of an ending\u201d. In his book of that name, Kermode argued that \u201ccrisis is a way of thinking about one\u2019s moment, and not inherent in the moment itself\u201d. Man arrives in the world <em>in media res</em>, and the apocalypse is a \u201ccoherent pattern\u201d he follows to create \u201cconsonance\u201d from the discord inherent in the individual\u2019s relationship to the world. (This is also why, when doomsday preppers get the date of the Rapture wrong, they always claim it was due to an interpretative or mathematical error \u2013 never because the myth is bunk.) We think about the world as a book, in other words, and \u201cone of the great charms of books is that they have to end\u201d, Kermode writes.</p> <p>The role of the critic is important here; he must stand outside the paradigm to \u201cmake sense of the ways in which we try to make sense of our lives\u201d. Near the beginning of his book, O\u2019Connell half-jokingly poses that the apocalyptic fantasies he grew up with in the 1980s were superior to the slow, painful climate collapse facing us today. \u201cNuclear war \u2026 adhered to certain established narrative conventions,\u201d he writes. \u201cYou had near misses, global panics \u2026 You had plot, was what you had: you had drama. And even more crucially, you had characters.\u201d He goes on to suggest that a crucial difference between the cold war and global warming is that in the cold war, most people were \u201cnot among the protagonists and antagonists\u201d, but \u201cbystanders, whose role was limited to cowering in terror\u201d. The trouble with the real apocalypse, he suggests, is that we are all authors of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>O'Connell doesn\u2019t portray himself as a critic, or an author \u2013 he portrays himself as the protagonist of a novel</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But this is a fiction, too \u2013 one that makes consonant our individual feelings of power and agency within the overwhelming global system of capital in which we are each insignificant. It\u2019s easily translated into the moral of <em>The Lorax</em>, which O\u2019Connell relies on for his hopeful conclusion: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d (Similarly, we would like to think decreasing carbon emissions is as simple as convincing enough people to stop travelling by plane.)</p> <p>It follows, then, that for much of the book, O\u2019Connell doesn\u2019t portray himself as a critic, or an author \u2013 he portrays himself as the protagonist of a novel. He can\u2019t help but frame the story as a reluctant hero\u2019s journey, a mid-life <em>Bildungsroman</em>. He notes that his usage of the word \u201cpilgrimages\u201d to describe his project is \u201cweirdly religious, even self-aggrandising\u201d, but nevertheless feels it\u2019s too apt to abandon. \u201cI was looking for something in these places, for some kind of enlightenment or edification or even solace.\u201d As he peppers the text with explicit literary references, he also finds himself in situations that quietly imitate art: among others, there are parallels to fictions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/03/ben-lerner-1004-novel-books-interview\">Ben Lerner</a> and L\u00e1szl\u00f3<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/may/20/man-booker-international-prize-laszlo-krasznahorkai-who-he-is-and-why-you-should-read-him\"> Krasznahorkai</a>, whom Susan Sontag called the \u201cmaster of the apocalypse\u201d. Signs, symbols, explanations of those signs and symbols, and incredible coincidences abound, so often that I suspected O\u2019Connell must have compressed, massaged, or otherwise altered what actually happened to fit the story he wanted to tell. At first, I wondered if his high-flown language was a wink at the gravity apocalypse inspires in people; as the book went on, I had to admit he was mostly serious.</p> <p>In order to create the illusion of seamlessness between his experiences and his thoughts, he\u2019s constantly \u201crealising\u201d things in scene, or else considering them, remembering them, being struck by them, or having them occur to him, though it seems likely he came up with them when reporting was done and he was toiling at his desk. I\u2019m sceptical they just appeared in his mind while he was zoning out at the Heathrow Yo! Sushi. Perhaps these are intended as little apocalypses, to suggest that serious thinking can lead to a break or rupture in one\u2019s life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25143d18d39085d61f549179bea5910d4cefc1ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25143d18d39085d61f549179bea5910d4cefc1ac/0_0_4531_2720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, at a forum on entrepreneurship and investment in Beijing, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, at a forum on entrepreneurship and investment in Beijing, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VCG/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But most damning is his treatment of other people, which reveals a more significant hypocrisy than claiming to care about the environment while still using an iPhone, the production of which destroys the world. Like his children, his subjects do not ever resemble real people but instead only ever serve some specific, singular purpose in the narrative. Thiel, for example, is \u201ca figure of almost cartoonishly outsized villainy \u2026 a human emblem of the moral vortex at the centre of the market\u201d. Most of the women in the book are the same stock character, a reserved sage nodding at O\u2019Connell\u2019s pointlessly spiralling thoughts as she goes on about her more important concerns: care work, sustaining life, \u201cattention\u201d.</p> <p>He introduces his wife as a woman of \u201cunfathomable resilience and practical wisdom, to whom such fugue states of panic and epochal despair were essentially foreign\u201d; she forbids him from bringing thoughts of <em>peripeteia</em> into the home. On his wilderness retreat, a rugged Australian woman helps him set up his tent and avoids embarrassing him with \u201cempathic skilfulness\u201d by explaining that she used to work at a camping store. (He then explains why this is so empathic and skilful.) Even his prepper friend with the go-bag is a source of quietly eye-opening higher perspective: when he says he\u2019d prefer to die in the apocalypse than to see what happens afterwards, she gently points out that women are \u201calready halfway to a dystopia. If she got raped tomorrow, for instance, she was by no means confident that she would go to the cops about it.\u201d</p> <p>In her 1965 essay \u201cThe Imagination of Disaster\u201d, Sontag wrote that fantasy allows us to cope with life \u201cunder continual threat of two equally fearful, but seemingly opposed, destinies: unremitting banality and inconceivable terror\u201d. When we fail to understand the relationship between fiction and reality, this coping mechanism stops working: all fictions become myths and prophesies. As we tear through history searching for some model to deal with pressing contemporary problems, \u201cprescience\u201d has emerged as the be-all and end-all of artistic accomplishment, inspiring in audiences almost quasi-religious admiration for \u201cvisionary\u201d talents. (Kermode points out that the phrase \u201cbe-all and end-all\u201d reflects a \u201cpregnant conflation of crisis and an end immanent in it\u201d. Shakespeare came up with it, in <em>Macbeth</em>.)</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just like Harry Potter, <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em>, <em>The Matrix</em>, and <em>Contagion</em>!\u201d social media users marvel when a news item resembles the plots of those stories. To treat these stories as prophesies is to miss the point of fictions completely. They\u2019re supposed to be like life. By attempting to make the reverse true, to make reality fit into a fiction, O\u2019Connell hasn\u2019t really overcome his apocalyptic imagination. He has just passed it off to someone else.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong><em>Notes from an Apocalypse is published by Granta (RRP \u00a314.99).</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 April 2020 to correct two instances where the word \u201cprophesy\u201d was used when \u201cprophecy\u201d was meant.</p>",
  "<p>It\u2019s almost a decade since David Cameron scrapped Labour plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/27/theresa-may-scrapping-id-cards\">national ID card</a>, and 13 years since fears about the government tracking all our movements helped <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6349027.stm\">kill off</a> pay-as-you-go road pricing.</p> <p>The idea of a \u201cblack box\u201d in the car, logging every mile driven, was deemed too creepy, even though in hindsight it could have lowered carbon emissions years ago by discouraging drivers from making unnecessary trips. But Britons guard their privacy jealously, at least outside wartime. It\u2019s surprising, then, how little debate there has been about the electronic surveillance culture this epidemic threatens to bring with it.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about police sending up drones to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/26/police-drone-video-shames-people-using-national-park-during-uk-lockdown-video\">shame</a> Peak District ramblers, or threatening to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52245937\">snoop</a> through supermarket shoppers\u2019 trolleys to check their trips were really necessary, but about what happens after lockdown is over. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/uk-app-to-track-coronavirus-spread-to-be-launched\">confirmed</a> at the weekend that the government is seeking to develop a phone app allowing people to record their own symptoms, and receive alerts if other users they\u2019ve been in contact with have fallen ill. Well, of course he did: this is the man who once invented the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt-hancock-matt\">Matt Hancock app</a>, for everyone desperate to keep up with all the Matt Hancock news. But what if this is more about Matt Hancock keeping up with you?</p> <p>Any future tracing app would almost certainly be voluntary in Britain, with strict confidentiality promised to protect users\u2019 privacy. It could be a godsend for people with vulnerable relatives, giving early warning of any brush with the virus that would help them to avoid unwittingly passing it on. True, we\u2019d be meekly handing over intimate details of our movements and social circles to an alliance of government and tech companies, but arguably that\u2019s no more information than we blithely give away by opening Google Maps or Facebook. Like staying home to save lives, getting the app could become seen as the socially responsible thing to do, helping save jobs by allowing a gradual return to normal while lowering the risk of reigniting infection. But, given that this could be a far longer lasting change to everyday life than lockdown, it\u2019s staggering how little we have been prepared for it.</p> <p>In authoritarian states such as Russia or China, the fear is surely that tracking systems could be abused. When Chinese citizens with a green code (for low infection risk) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/growth-in-surveillance-may-be-hard-to-scale-back-after-coronavirus-pandemic-experts-say\">can go out</a>, while a yellow or red code (denoting contact with an infected person, or confirmed infections) means restrictions, how easy would it be to punish political dissidents by tampering with their codes to keep them under effective house arrest?</p> <p>In Britain, the worry is more that everyday life could swiftly become difficult for those unwilling to sign up. Even if it\u2019s strictly voluntary, are we so sure that unscrupulous employers wouldn\u2019t demand applicants install the app as a condition of hiring, that rogue landlords won\u2019t try to discriminate against tenants who can\u2019t show they have it, that insurers won\u2019t seek to restrict health cover accordingly? Could airlines insist you get it before you fly, to protect fellow passengers? The risk is of creating another kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\">hostile environment</a> for those who resist. And that\u2019s to say nothing of questions about what access the security services might eventually seek to the data, or whether electronic tracking could become a habit that sticks once the epidemic is over. (Maybe road pricing isn\u2019t so dead after all.)</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see why government doesn\u2019t want to have this conversation now, arguing that talk of exit strategies risks distracting from core messages about staying home. Although Dominic Raab is expected to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-lockdown/britain-to-remain-in-lockdown-till-at-least-may-7-the-times-idUSKCN21V257\">announce</a> on Thursday that lockdown won\u2019t be lifted until after 7 May, that\u2019s simply the earliest date for review; there\u2019s no guarantee it won\u2019t drag on longer.</p> <p>Yet the implications of something like this need to be thoroughly explored before we move from blanket lockdown into what could be a more fluid and personalised version, where we might get something like our lives back but have to live with knowing they could be snatched away again. Ironically, it\u2019s probably those libertarians howling loudest for an end to lockdown now who\u2019d naturally hate the idea, while for others it will sound like a price worth paying for escape. Right now, I\u2019d probably download it like a shot. But until some basic questions are answered, we just don\u2019t know what we might be sacrificing for freedom.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

He warns that the health and lives of children using drugs or alcohol \u2013 or who are HIV-positive \u2013 are at greater risk if they cannot access the right treatment, or if they have to go through sudden withdrawal.</p> <p>In Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, many police now understand that for some children the street is home, says Paul Sunder Singh, founder of NGO <a href=\"https://karunalaya.ngo/\">Karunalaya</a>.

Ocean warming appears to have pushed many of the remaining small pelagic fish away from the west coast to areas off the south coast of South Africa, where there are very few islands.</p> <p>Nesting penguins starve if there are too few nutritious fish near breeding colonies; the parents can\u2019t hunt farther than 40km, at most, from the nest if they are to feed their young regularly. So Hagen and colleagues are pushing the traditional conservation envelope by trying to establish a new penguin colony on a stretch of the south coast of South Africa that has no offshore islands but is near some of the last remaining sardine stocks.</p> <p>They identified a small headland in <a href=\"https://www.dehoopcollection.com/8616-2/\">De Hoop nature reserve</a> and turned it into a pseudo island by cutting it off from the mainland with a predator-proof fence.

It appears that young penguins are falling into what scientists from the University of Exeter and the University of Cape Town refer to as <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2017-02-climate-fishing-penguins.html\">an \u201cecological trap\u201d</a>, and this <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216315366\">explains much of the overall population collapse</a>. Even if birds breed at the new colony, their offspring might also fall into this trap.</p> <p>Conservationists are now fighting on many fronts to keep African penguins alive, pointing out that thousands of other species are dependent on them and the cash they bring in from visitors. National park entry fees at Boulders Beach raised more than 72m rand (\u00a33.2m) in 2018-2019, helping to make Table Mountain one of South Africa\u2019s few parks to turn a profit and in turn subsididsing other parks in this megadiverse country.

  "<h2>Top story: A president physically distancing the facts</h2> \n<p>Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray delivering the first news offerings of the day.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has been condemned for putting countless lives at risk after announcing the US is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">freezing payments to the World Health Organization (WHO)</a> over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He accused it of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat, even though the WHO declared a public health emergency on 30 January \u2013 after which the president continued to hold rallies, play golf and compare the coronavirus to the common flu. It has also emerged that relief cheques to get hard-hit Americans through the crisis are being delayed because Trump wants his name printed on them.</p> \n<p>The WHO is indeed facing criticism but Trump\u2019s attacks have been laced with falsehoods and contradictions that are catalogued in Julian Borger\u2019s analysis: \u201cTrump\u2019s turn against the WHO only gathered pace over the past week, as more and more reports emerged of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/trump-turns-against-who-to-mask-his-own-stark-failings-on-covid-19-crisis\">administration\u2019s own complacent and dysfunctional response</a>.\u201d There has been condemnation across the world of Trump\u2019s action. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, said it was \u201ca crime against humanity \u2026 Every scientist, every health worker, every citizen must resist and rebel against this appalling betrayal of global solidarity.\u201d Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, said now was \u201cnot the time\u201d to cut funding or to question errors \u2013 a process that should take place \u201conce we have finally turned the page on this epidemic\u201d.</p> \n<p>In other coronavirus developments: mainland China reported a decline in new confirmed cases from 89 to 46 on Wednesday although an increasing number of local transmissions in its far north-east bordering Russia remained a concern.

Nine newspapers meanwhile reported this would mean dropping Thursday Night Football coverage, forcing Fox Sports to drop the Friday 6pm game and removing simulcasting, with Nine\u2019s outlay to be significantly less than what it currently pays the game.</p> <p>While Fox Sports have been far less vocal about their views on what the game needs to look like in 2020 despite missing their 1 April payment to the NRL, their subscription-driven model means they would likely welcome a return as soon as possible.</p> <p>With the cash injection from British banks brokered by Oakwell Sports Advisory, V\u2019landys will now be increasingly unlikely to rework any deal with Nine, meaning the broadcaster will be expected to broadcast any games played and pay for the same. There is only an infinitesimal chance that the season will be scrapped \u2013 something that would result in a $130m saving to Nine that was part of a $266m cost-saving plan presented at the JP Morgan virtual conference \u2013 and the NRL are unlikely to leave any money on the table that they don\u2019t have.</p> <p>More pressing for V\u2019landys and the NRL will be working with governments to get the competition stood back up. While the NRL has received the support of the NSW government, led by deputy premier John Barilaro who has volunteered to help the game at an all-of-government level, there has been resistance from both the Queensland government and the federal bureaucracy while the prime minister remains cautious.</p> <p>While Scott Morrison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/nrls-plan-to-start-games-by-end-of-may-is-ambitious-says-scott-morrison\">called the proposed 28 May </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/nrls-plan-to-start-games-by-end-of-may-is-ambitious-says-scott-morrison\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/nrls-plan-to-start-games-by-end-of-may-is-ambitious-says-scott-morrison\"> return date </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/nrls-plan-to-start-games-by-end-of-may-is-ambitious-says-scott-morrison\"> \u201cambitious\u201d</a>, the league fan did say: \u201cI like they\u2019ve got an ambitious date.\u201d Queensland premier Anastasia Palaszczuk was far more sceptical and said there would be no travel exemptions for rugby league and that State of Origin was unlikely to be held in Queensland in 2020, also scuppering any plans for an \u201cNRL Island\u201d or a bubble near the central Queensland city of Gladstone.</p> <p>The most pressing government-facing issue for the NRL outside of adhering to health guidelines is working to get exemptions for travel. New Zealand Warriors CEO Cameron George said his club had received no detail around travel plans for his team while there has been no official stance taken by any state government to go with no firm plan by the NRL.</p> <p>If the NRL is to be played exclusively in Sydney \u2013 the most likely scenario \u2013 the Warriors, the three Queensland clubs and Melbourne Storm would all likely need to go into quarantine by this weekend. It appears almost certain the competition will most likely be played in bubbles at ANZ Stadium and Penrith Stadium. There will likely be no crowds for the remainder of the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/nrl-island-recipe-for-ruin-or-a-world-leading-game-changer\">NRL Island: recipe for ruin or world-leading game-changer? | Larissa O'Connor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been no decision made on the structure with options ranging from a 15-round season concluding at the regular time and a full season wrapping up in December, but one high-ranking club official estimates a 20-round season is the most likely outcome.

State Of Origin is a very real chance of opening the season as it will be significantly easier to manage fewer numbers of players.</p> <p>The NRL still has plenty of work to do to colour in the outline of their plan. They need to gain majority approval from stakeholders on the structure. They need to properly incentivise participants to leave their families and enter a bubble. They need to work their way through government bureaucracy. But while V\u2019landys can drive a train through the eye of a needle, even he understands that the game cannot resume without at least the tacit approval of health officials.</p>",

Most of us dismiss the phenomenon as an irritating but unavoidable feature of modern life. But Proctor is the director of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/eu-brings-in-right-to-repair-rules-for-phones-and-tablets\">Right to Repair</a> campaign spawned by the US\u2019s <a href=\"https://uspirg.org/feature/usp/about-us\">Public Interest Research Group</a> (founded in 1971 by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/22/uselections2004.usa\">celebrated activist Ralph Nader</a>), and he wants us to see things very differently.</p> <p>As we throw away machines and devices damned as out of date, the result is a growing mountain of e-waste. Last year alone, it was reckoned that more than 50m tonnes of it were generated globally, with only around 20% of it officially recycled. Half of the 50m tonnes represented large household appliances, and heating and cooling equipment. The remainder was TVs, computers, smartphones and tablets.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d32633cee1a15a606396e2157210f9e4a165f387\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d32633cee1a15a606396e2157210f9e4a165f387/0_0_5000_3750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Broken CellphonesClose-up of a large number of broken cellphones, including cracked cellphone screens with exposed wiring, on a white surface, suggesting E Waste recycling, hacking or cybersecurity, December 7, 2018.

In the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/02/apple-iphone-slow-throttling-lawsuit-settlement\">Apple has recently agreed to pay up to $500m in settlements</a> related to allegations that software updates caused older iPhones \u2013 such as the iPhone 6, 6s Plus, 7 and 7 Plus \u2013 to slow down (the company denied any wrongdoing, and insisted the technique prevented older devices from shutting down altogether). In France, the same issue resulted in a fine of \u20ac25m (\u00a321m).</p> <p>In Norway, the supreme court is deciding on the battle between <a href=\"https://repair.eu/news/support-henrik-huseby-in-his-battle-with-apple/\">Apple and Henrik Huseby</a>, the owner of a small phone-repair shop, and the company\u2019s pursuit of claims about \u201ccounterfeit\u201d replacement screens that he insists were taken from old Apple devices. Meanwhile, the European commission has recently announced plans aimed at ensuring that a range of products will be \u201crecyclable, repairable and designed to last longer\u201d as part of a plan to halve waste across the EU by 2030.</p> <p>Different consumer choices might also be part of the answer, and Proctor\u2019s life as a tech consumer offers examples. The computer he is using to talk to me, he explains, is a Frankenstein PC \u2013 custom-built from parts of different computers, some of which were bought in the early 1990s. His iPhone dates from 2013. But he emphasises that what we choose to buy is much less important than the actions of governments and companies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The companies that make millions of smartphones should just not make them to break</p> <footer> <cite>Nathan Proctor, Right to Repair</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to fix this problem person by person, changing how we treat smartphones. The companies that make millions of smartphones should just not make them to break.\u201d A few computer companies do better (\u201cHP and Dell provide access to firmware, spare parts and tutorials \u2013 they\u2019re really good, as far as we can tell\u201d), but their actions heighten his exasperation that many tech corporations are reluctant to follow suit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the coronavirus crisis has brought our need for greater resilience and sustainability into sharp focus. Proctor noticed this from the start. \u201cA lot of new equipment \u2013 whether it\u2019s your electric fan or iPhone or networking equipment for your school or office \u2013 comes from China,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd because Chinese manufacturing was affected first, a lot of wholesalers saw a pretty significant increase in the demand for used equipment \u2013 whether that was laptops that schools were trying to redistribute so that kids could do homework, or hardware so that people could handle more remote operations.\u201d</p> <p>But wholesalers and refurbishers found much of the equipment was locked against reuse because of manufacturers\u2019 systems. \u201cYou can buy the hardware, but you don\u2019t have the permissions to use it without getting some kind of new service agreement. So that\u2019s another problem.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of planned or built-in obsolescence is certainly not new \u2013 it was first written about in 1928 by the American marketing pioneer Justus George Frederick. In the words of one subsequent account: \u201cHe stated that it was necessary to induce people to buy an ever-increasing variety of things, not in order to use them but to activate commerce and discard them after a short period of time.\u201d The concept even has its own film \u2013 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/16/man-white-suit-french-studiocanal\">The Man in the White Suit </a>(made in 1951, and recently screened as part of a BBC Two Ealing comedies series sparked by the lockdown), a chemist falls foul of textile producers and trade unions for creating a material that never needs replacing.</p> <p>Nearly a century on from Frederick\u2019s description, it seems his idea is everywhere, and it sometimes feels as if we are drowning in the detritus of planned obsolescence. The average time an individual keeps a smartphone is reckoned to be between two and three years. Astonishingly, according to EU research, the average lifetime of desktop printers is a mere five hours and four minutes of actual printing time. Ever-changing software spells the demise of fully functioning devices \u2013 which is why so many of us have household drawers filled with old ones, left behind \u2013 and often bricked \u2013 by the same companies that made them.</p> <p>Symbols of the extent to which companies make user repairs of their devices either impossible or extremely difficult are everywhere. iPhones are partly held together by Pentalobe screws, which are immune to standard screwdrivers. Some Amazon Kindles are constructed using glued plastic casing that is all but impossible to prise open. The reluctance of big companies to release information about the workings of their products is a constant source of frustration. </p> <p>All this is being closely watched by a Brussels-based organisation called the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/21/domestic-appliances-guzzle-far-more-energy-than-advertised-eu-survey\">European Environmental Bureau</a>. One of the groups\u2019s key staff members, 28-year-old Jean-Pierre Schweitzer, tells me the EU\u2019s plans for digital devices promise to extend the rules that apply to such household objects as fridges and washing machines to laptops, tablets and smartphones. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about really serious requirements, which include things about spare parts and product information,\u201d he says. Yet this prospect is still five or six years away, while Brexit means that even such belated moves may not apply in the UK, and our own mound of discarded electronic stuff could just carry on growing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"24252350268b7b23b1c86e202b5e455a6c2c4868\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24252350268b7b23b1c86e202b5e455a6c2c4868/0_173_4908_2946/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Use it to lose it ...

The problem with lots of them is that you can\u2019t replace the batteries. As soon as they run out, that\u2019s it. Anything where you have an issue with the battery is really problematic, because they are all lithium-ion. Those are really rare, valuable resources. But because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/23/apple-airpods-pro-wireless-earbuds-price\">head-headphones</a> are so small, people just throw them in their waste bins.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasingly, I\u2019m hearing a lot of complaints about products from Amazon. All of their stuff: Kindles, the hardware connected with Amazon Prime \u2013 apparently it has a very short lifespan. We\u2019re just getting to see that now.\u201d</p> <p>When I contact Apple, I get an email about its use of recycled materials: \u201cApple is using recycled cobalt from iPhone batteries recovered by its disassembly robot Daisy combined with scrap from final assembly sites for brand-new Apple batteries.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds impressive, yet Proctor points out that recycling is only a small part of any solution: \u201cRecycling is an incredibly destructive process that doesn\u2019t really get that much raw material back. Say your phone is kinda old and buggy. A refurbisher could switch the battery out, maybe reinstall the operating system and get another two years. If you scrap that phone for its commodity value \u2013 the plastic, glass, aluminium and copper \u2013 you\u2019re probably not recycling more than 20% of it.\u201d</p> <p>I then get a second email, which points to an announcement from last year, about \u201ca new repair programme, offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.</p> <p>\u201cApple will provide more independent repair businesses \u2013 large or small \u2013 with the same genuine parts, tools, training, repair manuals and diagnostics as its Apple Authorized Service Providers.\u201d This sounds like a modest victory for Right to Repair campaigners, but the announcement also contains a warning about using counterfeit parts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Many of our products are still in use after five years</p> <footer> <cite>Amazon</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I contact Amazon, a spokesperson says it is committed to sustainability. \u201cWe have built a refurbishment and trade-in programme that kept millions of devices from ending up in landfills in 2019 alone.

  "<p>From an outside perspective, South African cinema tends to announce itself through occasional breakout films rather than consistently visible directorial careers. Back in the 1980s, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080801/\">The Gods Must Be Crazy</a> was a global hit that didn\u2019t do much to raise the profile of its director, Jamie Uys. Fourteen years ago, gritty township fable <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468565/\">Tsotsi</a> won the country one of its first Oscars, only to send director Gavin Hood directly into a proficient but culturally anonymous Hollywood career.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3564996/\">Oliver Hermanus</a>, however, the country has produced its most significant auteur in several generations.

His 2009 graduation film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1483507/\">Shirley Adams</a>, a tough-minded mother-son portrait set on the Cape Flats, set the tone for a career marked by global critical acclaim.

And for me, that became not just about the character\u2019s sexuality, but about the shame factor: the fact that under this regime, boys were sort of shamed into becoming a certain kind of man. Because we keep asking the question, especially in South Africa: where does our toxic masculinity come from? When I looked at it that way, when I sort of saw this as an exploration of our past that informs our present, I was more comfortable with it.\u201d</p> <p>Van der Merwe\u2019s novel had a more defined romantic throughline; though Hermanus\u2019s film outlines an attraction between protagonist Nicholas (Kai Luke Brummer) and a fellow misfit recruit, he deliberately downplayed the love story. \u201cA key rule of mine from the very beginning was that there was going to be no kind of conventional love scene: it wasn\u2019t going to be a relationship drama,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was going to be more about our connection to this problematic era, and the generation of men who lived through that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5fae811811a5ee52fe7e17fd9bcf24989455e5d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fae811811a5ee52fe7e17fd9bcf24989455e5d1/0_33_1620_972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There wasn\u2019t going to be a conventional love scene\u2019 ...

One member of the press had a panic attack at a screening. These are common experiences but they haven\u2019t been widely addressed in South African culture.\u201d</p> <p>Though the film is set in the whites-only domain of the army, Hermanus doesn\u2019t skimp on depicting anti-black violence: \u201cIt was a dangerous choice, I know, to have all of the black characters be physical objects, victimised on the sidelines. But that\u2019s how it was: there\u2019s a white gaze there, and we needed to see that.\u201d He cites inspiration from the 2010 Abdellatif Kechiche historical drama <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/black-venus-film-review-30066\">Black Venus</a> \u2013 which depicted the white objectification and abuse of black South African performer Saartjie Baartman, to divisive effect.</p> <p>Hermanus is prepared for pushback on the point of view he\u2019s taken, but doesn\u2019t see South African cinema evolving via kid-glove treatment of its own ugly history. \u201cThe challenge in the South African film landscape right now is that it still seems to exist very much within racial boundaries: white money making nostalgia pieces for white people that are devoid of black people, and then you\u2019ve got black film-makers making romantic comedies and genre films about black lives,\u201d he says. \u201cThe films I make don\u2019t really exist in that market. And then I didn\u2019t want to make a safe film like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/02/mandela-long-walk-freedom-review\">Long Walk to Freedom</a>, where you kind of get everyone\u2019s perspective on everything.</p> <p>\u201cSo I decided we were going to put the world in the headspace of white South Africa in the 80s, to show what that looked like from the inside,\u201d he concludes. Moffie delivers vividly and discomfitingly on that promise: Hermanus continues to make films that feel as bracing and urgent to locals as to international onlookers.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-moffie-film-online\">Moffie is released on 24 April</a> on Curzon Home Cinema.</p></li> </ul>",

That question is one for us and our elected representatives.</p> <p>Federal and state governments have, to date, done a great job of managing the spread of Covid-19. Where wealthy countries like the US and UK have seen cases and deaths tragically soar, Australia has largely contained the spread.</p> <p>There have been deaths, but not a single person has died due to a lack of medical care\u2014 because we have contained the spread effectively enough that our intensive care wards aren\u2019t over-full and our medical staff aren\u2019t stretched to (complete) exhaustion.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/australia-coronavirus-diabolical-decisions-choose-with-care\">Coronavirus will force Australia to make diabolical decisions \u2013 we must choose with care | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some mistakes were made and some decisions were poorly communicated but, overall, Australian leaders have responded quickly and effectively to the advice of our medical experts. As a result, Australia has succeeded in largely dodging the first bullet this pandemic sent our way.</p> <p>But where to from here? If we want to ensure that no one catches Covid-19, our medical experts have shown us that they know how to deliver on that goal. We need to keep our borders closed, we need to stay at home as much as possible and we need to ensure there are no large gatherings of people. It\u2019s not fun and it\u2019s not cheap, but it works.</p> <p>The question is, do we want to keep \u201ccrushing the curve\u201d by keeping 25 million people locked in their homes, and out of their beaches and parks? That\u2019s not a medical question, it\u2019s a democratic one. The sooner we acknowledge that, the better our democratic debate will be. We don\u2019t need to pit scientists against each other to resolve such a question, we need to pit arguments and options against each other.</p> <p>Australians often choose to ignore experts, whether they be lawyers, economists, film critics, pollsters or medical doctors. If we always listened to economists, we wouldn\u2019t just have a carbon tax, we could also have toll roads as far as the eye can see. If we always listened to lawyers, most people would never go to court. And if we always listened to doctors, we would have banned alcohol, tobacco and junk-food advertising decades ago. Medical science knows how to save a lot of lives, but it\u2019s a democratic decision as to how much of that advice we should take.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"newsletter sign up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The advice from medical experts says that, at best, a vaccine is 12 to 18 months away, and could come with potential side effects that are yet unknown. Australia can choose to keep all our borders, beaches and schools closed until a vaccine is found, but if we make that choice, we must do so knowing that such controls could continue indefinitely. No doctor or scientist can make that decision on our behalf.</p> <p>Obviously, no one wants the horrific scenes from Italy and the US to be repeated here in Australia. While there are other paths besides locking the population down or letting the virus rip, there are obvious risks to exploring such unmarked trails.</p> <p>Reasonable people looking at the same range of information will inevitably disagree on both how long we should stay locked down, and which unmarked trail to follow when we do take our first tentative steps away from the current restrictions.</p> <p>But, like it or not, those questions will need to be asked and answered in the coming weeks. We must admit that while sheltering in our homes and locking up our borders has helped drive the spread of the virus down towards zero, hiding from the world and each other for another 12 months will not make us \u201cstronger\u201d or \u201cmore resilient\u201d. It will just make us more stressed, isolated and impoverished.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/we-need-to-live-restricted-lives-for-at-least-six-months-police-enforced-lockdowns-are-unnecessary\">We need to live restricted lives for at least six months \u2013 police enforced lockdowns are unnecessary | Peter Collignon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australian governments have done a great job of avoiding the first wave of this pandemic. But their swift action based on the best science did not buy us safety, it bought us time. We now have the chance to use that time to make good, but likely not perfect, decisions about what we do next.</p> <p>The benefits of domestic and international lockdowns need to be held up against the physical, psychological and economic costs to individuals and communities.</p> <p>With no prospect of a vaccine for at least a year, it\u2019s obvious that a rigorous approach to hand washing and social distancing needs to stay in place. But not all questions are that straightforward. For example:</p> <ul> <li><p>Should restaurants stay shut for 12 months or should they allow tables of four or less to dine together?</p></li> <li><p>Should non-essential retail stores stay shut for 12 months or should they allow limited numbers of customers in at any point in time?</p></li> <li><p>Should airlines stay grounded for 12 months or should people be allowed to fly if they don\u2019t sit next to a stranger?</p></li> <li><p>Should schools stay shut for 12 months or should they open with strict social distancing between students and teachers?</p></li> </ul> <p>Just as there is no \u201cright answer\u201d to how fast we should let people drive, there is no right answer to which activities are too risky in the age of Covid-19. Medical science can tell us how to prevent the spread of a disease, but it can\u2019t tell us how much risk we should take. And while there is no right way to judge how much risk is too much risk, there are better and worse ways to have democratic debates about such decisions.</p> <p>We need to be open and honest about the role of evidence, the role of democracy, and the limits of both. Just as scientists will disagree about which are the most important restrictions to keep or remove, so too will our politicians disagree about which experts to listen to. It was ever thus, but that didn\u2019t stop us from curtailing smoking, drink driving and measles.</p> <p>Sadly, the debate about climate change science and policy has ruined much of Australia\u2019s faith in democratic problem solving. It\u2019s an understatement to suggest that when it comes to the role of fossil fuels in heating our planet, there has been too much politics and not enough evidence.</p> <p>But just as it made no sense to politicise the science of climate change, it makes no sense to politicise the science of Covid-19. Just as there is no \u201cright\u201d amount of climate change to cause, there is no \u201cright\u201d amount of COVID-19 to allow to spread through the community. While many climate scientists have argued that we should limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, that number isn\u2019t chiselled in stone. It\u2019s a democratic compromise, not a scientific fact.</p> <p>From a risk point of view, 1.6C would be better than 2C (and 1.3C would be even better still). But while the science around what happens if we continue to increase greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere is clear, the science of choosing the right amount of risk has never been, and never will be, crystal clear.</p> <p>The same issue now confronts us with Covid-19. As with climate change, the safest number to aim for is zero. But as with climate change, many people don\u2019t think that it is necessary or desirable, or even possible, to aim that low.</p> <p>Until a vaccine is invented, we are going to need to have a very hard, very important conversation about how much risk to accept from Covid-19. The science will not be crystal clear, there will be differing views from well informed people and hard choices will need to be made, often in real time, regardless of how uncertain the consequences of those choices are. Hopefully, when debating these questions, we can treat the scientists with respect and cut our politicians a little slack.</p> <p>When we are finished with this crisis, maybe we can take a fresh look at the fact that in the 30 years since Australia first agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, we have nearly doubled the amount of coal and oil we burn, saying it is \u201cuneconomic\u201d to do otherwise.</p> <ul> <li><p>Richard Denniss is the chief economist at independent think tank The Australia Institute</p></li> </ul>",

As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIV/AIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>WHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia\u2019s minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country\u2019s health system.</p>\n    <p>WHO's handling of the global pandemic has been criticised by US president Donald Trump, who announced in April that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">the US will no longer contribute to funding the agency</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>Grace Mainwaring </b><i>and</i><b> Martin Belam</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO first raised the alert over the Wuhan outbreak on 5 January, and beginning on 7 January it was briefing public health officials from the US and other national governments on the outbreak in regular teleconference calls. On 9 January the <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/69650/timeline-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-and-u-s-response/\">WHO distributed guidance</a> to member states for their own risk assessment and planning.</p> \n<p>Trump and his supporters have focused on a 14 January WHO tweet reporting the findings of preliminary Chinese studies suggesting \u201cno clear evidence\u201d of human-to-human transmission.</p> \n<p>While the WHO was obliged to report on the latest findings of a member state at the source of the outbreak, its officials told their counterparts in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\"> technical briefings on 10 and 11 January</a>, and briefed the press on 14 January, that human-to-human transmission was still a strong possibility given the experience of past coronavirus epidemics and urged suitable precautions.</p> \n<p>Yamey said it was ridiculous to point to a single tweet early in the pandemic as the fixed position of the WHO. \u201cThe whole point of science is that we have initial hypotheses and initial ideas, and we update those ideas as more and more data emerges,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On 23 January the WHO updated its account of the coronavirus threat, confirming human-to-human transmission and warning that the global risk was high. One week later it formally declared a global emergency.</p> \n<p>Announcing the cut in funding on Tuesday, Trump accused the WHO of failing to send its experts to the source of the outbreak to gather samples. That failure decisively set back the effect to contain the pandemic, he claimed.</p> \n<p>In fact Beijing blocked a WHO delegation from visiting Wuhan in the first weeks of the outbreak. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, had to <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1737014.shtml\">fly to Beijing</a> to meet Xi Jinping on 29 January to negotiate entry and information sharing. A WHO team was allowed to visit Wuhan on 22 February. Tedros has been criticised for his flattery of Xi and the Chinese response, in the face of Beijing\u2019s obstructionism and cover-up attempts. His defenders said that such diplomacy was the price for entry.</p> \n<p>Trump did more than his own fair share of Xi flattery. On 24 January, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1220818115354923009?lang=en\">president tweeted</a> \u201cChina has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus \u2026 The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The claim that the delay in the WHO acquiring samples crippled the international response is also false. Chinese scientists publicly released the genetic sequence of Covid-19 on 11 January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bbdedea8-3745-42f9-a4fe-eb53a8598b4f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1zHDqywPrnc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By early February the WHO was in a position to distribute a Covid-19 test worldwide, but the US government opted not to have it fast-tracked through approval. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) instead produced its own test at about the same time, but it was flawed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">had to be recalled</a>. US testing would be set back more than six weeks compared to the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>While virtually no testing was under way in the US throughout February, Trump assumed the consequently low number of confirmed US cases meant that his country had somehow escaped. \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1232058127740174339?lang=en\">boasted on 24 February</a>, nearly a month after the WHO declaration of emergency. \u201cWe are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health [Organisation] have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s turn against the WHO only gathered pace over the past week, as more and more reports emerged of the administration\u2019s own complacent and dysfunctional response.</p> \n<p>The impact of a block on US funds is likely to mitigated by other countries, who have almost unanimously expressed confidence in the WHO, stepping up their own financial backing. The UK, for example, has announced \u00a3200m in new funding for international efforts to contain and combat the pandemic, of which \u00a365m is earmarked for the WHO.</p> \n<p>How well Trump\u2019s scapegoating of the WHO will play in the US election is impossible to predict, but on the world stage it will undoubtedly be seen as yet another step in an accelerating US abdication of global leadership.</p>",

In the meantime, here\u2019s what we know about ventilator shortages in the US:</strong></p> \n  <p>It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said.</p> \n  <p>However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\">31 times that number</a> to treat coronavirus patients. <br></p> \n  <p>An article in the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMp2006141\">New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March </a>categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months.<br></p> \n  <p>The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

The experts <a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1249731213566324740\">dismissed</a> that claim.</p> \n  <p>Then at a White House briefing marked by attacks on reporters and the playing of a propaganda film half-ripped from Fox News, <strong>Trump made a claim for the ages</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Constitutional lawyers: Nope.</p> \n  <p>CNN, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goldengateblond/status/1249829406719143937\"><strong>CBS reporter Paula Reid</strong></a> and most of the rest of the press corps: Incredulous.</p> \n  <p>Fox News?</p> \n  <p>Laura Ingraham: \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed today\u2019s coronavirus task force briefing.

We don\u2019t have to wait until 1 May.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s the date by which Trump, the panjandrum of the White House podium, has said he would like to start reopening the shuttered US economy.</p> \n  <p>White House experts including the notably not-yet-fired Dr Anthony Fauci have cast doubt on that goal and said moving too swiftly to lift social restrictions <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/trump-fauci-hahn-reopening-who-virus-stalk-human-race\">could cause a resurgence in Covid-19 cases</a></strong>.
